Rohingya who've fled have spoken of their homes being torched , of neighbors turning on neighbors, of relatives taken away never to be seen again.

Read More Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said that including some 300,000 Rohingya refugees already in Bangladesh, between 700,000 and 800,000 people were now sheltering there in overcrowded and insanitary conditions, posing a risk of epidemics. On top of that, he warned that \"the risk of the spread of terrorist violence in the whole region is very, very high\" if the situation is not resolved. The Rohingya are being ethnically cleansed: Why won't the world take action? \"It is very clear that the cause of this crisis is in Myanmar, but the solution of this crisis also lies in Myanmar,\" he said. \"Let me once again, as many other colleagues have done, as the (UN) secretary-general has done, let me reiterate the urgent call to the authorities in Myanmar to stop violence, for violence to stop in Rakhine State, in northern Rakhine State, and when that happens, and conditions stabilize, we have to start thinking about solutions.\" The Myanmar authorities have said the violence in Rakhine State was instigated by Rohingya militants and deny UN accusations of \" ethnic cleansing .\" Grandi, who visited Rakhine State in July, condemned the insurgent attacks that left 12 police officers dead the following month. But he stressed that underdevelopment in Rakhine state -- and particularly the poor treatment of the Rohingya Muslims -- had played a large part in the current crisis. Myanmar's military: The power Aung San Suu Kyi can't control \"It was ... very obvious to me when I visited northern Rakhine that it was just a matter of time before terrorism would spring up from the situation of discrimination or poverty that prevailed in that area,\" he said. \"The terrain is very fertile for that, so it is also a question of addressing this issue not only for the Rohingya, not only for northern Rakhine, but for the entire region. Because if the situation is not resolved, the risk of the spread of terrorist violence in the whole region -- and this is a particularly fragile region -- is very, very high.\" Grandi added that the \"big question\" was whether the Rohingya refugees would be able to return to Rakhine state. He called on the Myanmar authorities to implement the recommendations of a UN advisory panel headed by former UN chief Kofi Annan. Two key points were the lack of citizenship for Rohingya in Myanmar and the \"dramatic underdevelopment\" of Rakhine state, affecting both Buddhist and Muslim communities, he said. Grandi said he hoped to discuss the issue of Rohingya statelessness with Myanmar authorities at a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, next week. JUST WATCHED Who is Aung San Suu Kyi?\nWho is Aung San Suu Kyi? 01:41 Grandi praised the response of the Bangladeshi government to the sudden influx of refugees and said aid efforts were now making headway after a \"chaotic\" start.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. An illustration of the newly discovered giant tree rat, Uromys vika, known by the locals as \"vika.\" Story highlights A new species of giant tree rat has been found on Vangunu Island, part of the Soloman islands Researchers were only able to locate one (CNN) After years of searching, researchers have confirmed the discovery a new mammal in the Solomon Islands: an endangered giant tree rat known as \"vika\" by the locals. But they were only able to locate one. The rare animal looks more like a cute cross between a squirrel and a possum than a large rat. Local rumors describe it as a tree-dwelling creature that can crack coconuts open with its two front teeth. A new study released in the Journal of Mammology on Wednesday includes details and images of the lone vika that researchers were able to observe on Vangunu Island. Tyrone Lavery, a post-doctoral researcher at The Field Museum in Chicago and the lead author of the study, first heard rumors about vika during his first visit to Vangunu in 2010 and kept returning to the island, in search of it. The search became a race against time because deforestation was taking away vika's habitat -- the canopy of the island's rainforest. Lavery had two little clues along the way. The mention of \"vika\" in anthropologist Edvard Hviding's dictionary of the Marovo language , written 20 years ago, and when a team from the Australian Museum in Sydney went looking for the rat in 1992, nuts and coconuts with little holes cut out of them to extract the \"meat\" could be found on the island. Evidence of nuts with circular holes removed by rats in the Solomon Islands. Read More The rats had also become part of the local culture itself, appearing in songs and children's rhymes. \"Many of the native rodents found in Solomon Islands are featured in the culture of local people,\" Lavery said. \"People at Zaira [village on Vangunu Island] have a really detailed knowledge of this species that has been passed down over centuries through the oral history that is very strong in Melanesia.\" But vika remained elusive. The incredibly tall trees of the forest made the creature almost impossible to find. This required traps placed in the canopy and spotlighting -- both difficult in the dense rainforest. And the species itself seemed rare. An unfortunate accident revealed the creature for the first time in late 2015 to Lavery's co-author,Hikuna Judge, a wildlife ranger from the Zaira Conservation Area -- a conservation area run by the Zaira village. The vika, while it was still alive. \"It was taken from a tree that was cut down in forests that were being logged by a commercial company,\" Lavery said. \"It was injured when the tree was cut down and unfortunately died a short time after.\" Judge saw the animal while it was still alive and the research teamknew it was different than the other eight known species of rat that can be found in the Solomon Islands. Unique biology The unique features of vika include orange-brown fur, short, round ears, a smooth tail with fine scales and broad back feet that enable it to walk along branches, Lavery said. It weighs just over 2 pounds and measures a foot and half in length. When compared to the average rat you might see in the city -- which weighs less than half a pound -- it's no wonder vika is considered a giant rat. The rainforest on Vangunu Island. It is closely related to three species of rat on the Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands: the ground-dwelling silvery emperor rat and red Guadalcanal rat, as well as the tree-dwelling silvery king rat. All of these rats have smooth tails with small scales on them. If these sound odd, it's to be expected among the animals found in the Solomon Islands. The network of islands about 1,000 miles northwest of Australia are isolated, but rich in species diversity. 'Goldilocks zone' The Solomon Islands are in the \"Goldilocks zone\" -- not too close but not too far away from New Guinea, which is quite diverse. It is believed that the ancestors of some of the rare animals that can only be found living in the Solomon Islands, like vika, migrated from the island of New Guinea or Australia by rafting on vegetation. Once arriving in the Solomon Islands, they evolved into a new species that adapted to the environment. Researchers still have many questions they want to answer about vika after finding just one of the species, but they are encouraged by the discovery. A watercolor illustration of the vika. \"We had been working hard to find this animal,\" Lavery said. \"Now that we have finally documented it, we hope it will attract additional support for the Zaira conservation area on southern Vangunu. Our best hope to preserve this animal is to support Zaira village. They are a community right next to where this species was found and they are very determined to preserve their forest against logging. He believes the discovery is important because it has documented an unknown mammal that can now be classified on the IUCN Red List [of Threatened Species] to help work outways to save it, and seek financial support from donor agencies. \"It is also important in the context of the Solomon Islands. Prior to this, the Western Province was a big gap where no other species of rat where known to occur, so this helps us to understand how mammals evolved and diversified on these islands,\" he said.

At a secretive press event held on Wednesday in downtown Seattle, the company showed off new versions of its popular Amazon Echo device. There is an updated original Echo, an Echo Plus that includes a smart home hub, and the odd little Echo Spot, which is like an alarm clock with a screen. \nThe event was held at Amazon's \"Day One\" building, a 37-floor tower that opened late last year. The building is part of Amazon's new campus in downtown Seattle, a $4 billion multi-building project that includes a 5-story glass dome structure for plants. \nUpdated Echo \nThe original Echo is getting a new look. The new Echo is shorter and fatter than the original -- and available in finishes including wood veneers, brushed metal and a heather grey fabric. \nIt has some improvements inside as well. There's a new speaker that Amazon says will improve vocal and bass quality. The new far-field microphone will do a better job of blocking out background noise and hearing the \"Alexa\" wake word, according to the company. \nIt will cost $100 and start shipping in October. \nThe Echo Plus \nAmazon also revealed the even Echo Plus, which doubles as a smart home hub. A tall and skinny cylinder like the original, the Plus is available in a new grey finish. \nSmart home devices are usually controlled through a dedicated hub. The Plus builds that in, so you can add new gadgets by saying \"Alexa, discover devices.\" It can control lightbulbs and smart plugs and locks. It has the same updated speakers and microphones as the classic Echo. \nEach Echo Plus will ship with a starter bulb from Philips to get people hooked on smart home devices. It will cost $149 and be available in October. \nThe Echo Spot \nAmazon also wants Alexa to be your new alarm clock. The Echo Spot is a round Alexa-powered gadget with a touchscreen and a small camera. It's like a mini Echo Show. You can watch videos on it, get your morning briefing, or use it as a baby monitor. There's a front-facing camera if you like to make video calls from bed. The device will cost $130 and ship in December in the U.S. \nAlexa updates for everyone \nExisting Echo devices are also getting a features boost. You'll be able to play music on multiple Echos at once by saying requests like \"Alexa, play Cardi B. everywhere.\" The updates are available via the cloud, so users don't have to download new software. \nYou can group commands together as \"routines\" so that a single command (\"Alexa, good morning\") can turn up the lights, start playing NPR and turn on your connected tea kettle. Or \"Alexa, date time\" to lower the lights and turn on Barry White. Meet the new Echo. Hipster fabric look, like Google Daydream and some IKEA boxes I own. Also comes in wood, brushed metal! pic.twitter.com/fvexOWy7T7 \u2014 Heather Kelly \ud83e\udd81 (@heatherkelly) September 27, 2017 \nAmazon's Echo line does more than play music and spit out trivia. In fact, Amazon sees it inching toward replacing the home landline. Starting today, you'll be able to make phone calls to any numbers in the US, Mexico and Canada for free. \nIf you want to connect your Echo to your landline, Amazon is selling a $35 black box called Amazon Connect that links the two. You can get calls at your home number and, if necessary, call 911 from an Echo. \nAlexa in the car \nThe company is also bringing the Echo's built-in voice assistant Alexa to the car so drivers can order pizza or change tunes while on the highway. It will be included in select BMW cars starting in 2018. \nThe Echo Button \nAmazon noticed people were frequently using the Echo to play games and have fun, so it decided to make a dedicated device just for that. The new Echo Button is about two inches high with a blinking light on top. It's designed to work with social games, most likely as a buzzer. The company is working with developers such as Hasbro on games like Trivial Pursuit. Price: $20 for two Buttons. \nA new Fire TV dongle \nThe latest version of the Fire TV is a square dongle that plugs into the back of your TV. It has HDR and 4K support, and comes with a remote that works with Alexa commands. You can also control it with any other Echo device to do things like select shows, fast forward or rewind. The Fire TV costs $70 and will be available in late October. \nThe event \nAmazon has been busy building its new Seattle campus. The centerpiece of the headquarters is a building made of three converging domes. Called the Amazon Spheres, the 90-foot high glass and steel structures will be home to a lush botanical garden and a 60-foot \"living wall\" made of plants. \nThe event came two weeks after Apple's iPhone 8 and iPhone X event held at its new Cupertino headquarters . \nRelated: First look at Apple Park, Steve Jobs' dream campus \nAmazon launched its Echo smart speaker in 2014. That device started a race among major tech companies to create their own versions of the surprise hit. Google created the Google Home, Apple is releasing the Home Pod later this year, and Microsoft is working with third-parties on speakers that use Cortana. \nMeanwhile, Amazon is working to get its Alexa voice interface in a variety of products. The tech world is betting that voice will be the next big computer interface, and Amazon wants to keep its head start.

That failure ensures that, for the foreseeable future at least, Obamacare will remain the law of the land. Appointed Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, whom both men endorsed, lost badly in a Republican runoff to a candidate backed by Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, a McConnell ally and someone Trump urged just 12 days ago to run for a third term, decided against the race -- and, in so doing, created a potential headache for his party in the 2018 midterms. While Trump and McConnell suffered those indignities together, they each also had to deal with humiliations on their own over this three-day span. Read More Trump somehow managed to not only unite the NFL owners and players but also stoke racial tensions with a five-day long attack on professional athletes who protest during the national anthem. While he was distracted by his fight with the NFL, Trump also drew widespread criticism for his day-late-and-dollar-short handling of the devastation cause by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. And, oh yeah, special counsel Bob Mueller's investigation into Russia involvement in the 2016 election continued to pick up speed and widen its aperture . For McConnell, he must now grapple with what \"Senator Roy Moore\" could mean for his already-narrow majority. And deal with skittish incumbents up in 2018 worried that they will become the next Luther Strange. And deal with Trump who, according to CNN's White House team , is angry at McConnell for allegedly misleading him about Strange's chances of winning. (That may be the least surprising report of the year.) Then there's this final indignity: Outlets are reporting that Rick Pitino will be fired by the University of Louisville , McConnell's alma mater, later today. Welcome to Washington 2017! Consider that Trump and McConnell are, without question, the two most powerful Republicans in a Republican-dominated nation's capital. This should be the golden age for both men -- a time of unified Republican rule that should allow a series of conservative principles to flower. To date, however, the lone major accomplishment of this Republican dominance is the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. That's not a small thing but for an administration and a GOP congressional leadership who expected health care reform and tax reform to be done (or almost done) by this point, it's a major disappointment. And signs point to the road getting harder, not easier for McConnell and Trump. Tax reform, which Trump is expected to preview today in a speech in Indiana, will be no easy thing -- particularly given that a good chunk of the lobbying community in Washington is built around protecting this tax break or that one for a series of ultra-specialized industries. Plus, major -- and complex -- legislation is never as easy to move through Congress as people seem to think. Republicans need only look at their failed efforts on Obamacare to (re)learn that lesson. Bannon will be emboldened by Moore's victory -- as will the grassroots army he kind-of, sort-of commands. While recreating Alabama won't be as easy as some think -- Moore had been kicking around Alabama conservative circles for a very long time -- there's no question that the movement to get rid of people like Roger Wicker (Mississippi) and Dean Heller (Nevada) has more energy today than it did yesterday. Viewed at its most broad, what this week reflects is the relatively limited power of anyone -- up to and including the two leading Republicans in Washington -- to control the GOP right now. While Trump rode the anti-Washington/anti-politician wave to the Republican primary nomination, he neither created it nor is able to command it. (If he was, Strange would have won -- not lost by a bigger margin than in the first vote back in August.) In recent elections, McConnell appeared to have learned how to wrestle the activist party base to the ground following a series of damaging primary losses in 2010 and 2012. But, the rise of Moore -- and McConnell's unwillingness to spend the conservative firebrand into oblivion -- suggests that the distance between the GOP establishment and its base remains as wide as ever. What's been made very clear this week is that Trump's election wasn't the end of the populist revolt within the GOP. It was only the beginning. And that this revolt doesn't have a leader to whom everyone in it listens. Or, if there is that leader, it's Bannon who has publicly warned the party establishment that his ultimate goal is to bring about their total destruction. In short, this horrible week for Washington Republicans may turn out to be the rule, not the exception going forward into 2018.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mcconnell", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "obamacare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob corker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luther strange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger wicker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rick pitino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dean heller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bannon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of louisville", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T18:58:37.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d765aae7484b767ff6905173ae78e36259aa7cd1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWFZFwEOSjRHy_naFTvjYF9.UebKdt6.KHK1tD2RZ2npmXIUviDO42v4qCUTFf18JnxB6Yud0SEEIqfp18Iyo7ZANvGgqGKw14Y-", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "'The Hunt': Abusive boyfriend murders his ex - CNN", "title_full": "'The Hunt': Abusive boyfriend murders his ex - CNN", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170927110302-the-hunt-john-walsh-rudy-fernandez-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 49, "comments": 0, "shares": 49}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d765aae7484b767ff6905173ae78e36259aa7cd1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWFZFwEOSjRHy_naFTvjYF9.UebKdt6.KHK1tD2RZ2npmXIUviDO42v4qCUTFf18JnxB6Yud0SEEIqfp18Iyo7ZANvGgqGKw14Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cnn", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "'The Hunt': Abusive boyfriend murders his ex - CNN", "text": "Story highlights Got a tip?

Read More Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said that including some 300,000 Rohingya refugees already in Bangladesh, between 700,000 and 800,000 people were now sheltering there in overcrowded and insanitary conditions, posing a risk of epidemics. On top of that, he warned that \"the risk of the spread of terrorist violence in the whole region is very, very high\" if the situation is not resolved. The Rohingya are being ethnically cleansed: Why won't the world take action? \"It is very clear that the cause of this crisis is in Myanmar, but the solution of this crisis also lies in Myanmar,\" he said. \"Let me once again, as many other colleagues have done, as the (UN) secretary-general has done, let me reiterate the urgent call to the authorities in Myanmar to stop violence, for violence to stop in Rakhine State, in northern Rakhine State, and when that happens, and conditions stabilize, we have to start thinking about solutions.\" The Myanmar authorities have said the violence in Rakhine State was instigated by Rohingya militants and deny UN accusations of \" ethnic cleansing .\" Grandi, who visited Rakhine State in July, condemned the insurgent attacks that left 12 police officers dead the following month. But he stressed that underdevelopment in Rakhine state -- and particularly the poor treatment of the Rohingya Muslims -- had played a large part in the current crisis. Myanmar's military: The power Aung San Suu Kyi can't control \"It was ... very obvious to me when I visited northern Rakhine that it was just a matter of time before terrorism would spring up from the situation of discrimination or poverty that prevailed in that area,\" he said. \"The terrain is very fertile for that, so it is also a question of addressing this issue not only for the Rohingya, not only for northern Rakhine, but for the entire region. Because if the situation is not resolved, the risk of the spread of terrorist violence in the whole region -- and this is a particularly fragile region -- is very, very high.\" Grandi added that the \"big question\" was whether the Rohingya refugees would be able to return to Rakhine state. He called on the Myanmar authorities to implement the recommendations of a UN advisory panel headed by former UN chief Kofi Annan. Two key points were the lack of citizenship for Rohingya in Myanmar and the \"dramatic underdevelopment\" of Rakhine state, affecting both Buddhist and Muslim communities, he said. Grandi said he hoped to discuss the issue of Rohingya statelessness with Myanmar authorities at a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, next week. JUST WATCHED Who is Aung San Suu Kyi?

Tom Harkin to take stand in Menendez trial - CNNPolitics", "text": "Newark, New Jersey (CNN) A former federal health administrator told jurors that Sen. Bob Menendez's staff pressured officials for a favorable resolution in a multimillion-dollar Medicare dispute involving the senator's friend, as prosecutors continue to press their bribery case against the New Jersey Democrat.\nThe testimony largely eclipsed that of former Sen. Tom Harkin, a one-time Democratic presidential candidate, whom the prosecution also called to the stand Wednesday. Menendez defense team seeks to undercut theory of corrupt intent Prosecutors say Menendez pushed high-level federal officials to help his wealthy friend and co-defendant, Dr. Salomon Melgen, avoid $8.9 million in overbilling charges levied by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in exchange for luxury vacations, rides on private jets and other perks. The men maintain they broke no laws. One of Menendez's staffers was particularly \"persistent\" in advocating for the doctor on a telephone call with several agency officials in July 2009, according to Dr. Louis Jacques, a former director of coverage and analysis at CMS. Jacques testified that the staffer said \"the issue is very important to the senator, Melgen is a personal friend, bad medicine is not illegal, Medicare should pay these claims.\" Read More Jacques said he was so disturbed by the staffer's words and that he told the jury he got up from his seat to \"stretch\" and \"clear (my) head\" at the doorway. \"Aside from those particular statements, the call would have been entirely forgettable to me -- the reason why I remember it specifically are those statements,\" Jacques added. Melgen had been treating patients suffering from macular degeneration with a drug called Lucentis. Prosecutors say that federal regulations at the time approved the drug for \"single-use\" only, meaning that each vial should only be used for a single eye of a single patient, but the doctor used the \"overfill\" from the vials to treat up to three patients -- and then billed Medicare as if a separate vial was purchased for each dose. CMS hit Melgen with a formal repayment demand in 2009 to the tune of $8.9 million in alleged overbillings, at which point prosecutors say Menendez got involved, encouraging federal officials to help Melgen quash the charges, including Harkin -- then-chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which shared oversight responsibility over CMS and the Department of Health and Human Services. Poll: New Jersey voters say Sen. Menendez should quit if convicted Harkin, an Iowa Democrat who donned a blue blazer and khakis for a rare trial appearance, told jurors he agreed to meet with Melgen as a \"senatorial courtesy\" to Menendez, which was not unusual. And the former Senate colleagues appeared friendly in court Wednesday, as Harkin stopped at counsel table to smile and shake Menendez's hand before departing for the day. Melgen did most of the talking to \"present his side of the story\" during the 2011 meeting, while Menendez silently listened to the doctor describe \"a problem he was having with CMS,\" Harkin said, further elaborating on two specific takeaways. \"One, I was curious as to why the (Food and Drug Administration) would put so much of that medicine in a vial,\" Harkin said. \"I wondered about that. ... It sounds kind of odd.\" Earlier Wednesday the jury heard Jacques explain that splitting the vial among different patients, known as \"multi-dosing,\" created a risk of infection, but Harkin said that Melgen assured that he was using \"clean needles.\" \"I said the other part of it is, if he's treating three people, charging for three, but only paying for one (vial), that doesn't sound right either,\" Harkin added.

But they were only able to locate one.\nThe rare animal looks more like a cute cross between a squirrel and a possum than a large rat. Local rumors describe it as a tree-dwelling creature that can crack coconuts open with its two front teeth. A new study released in the Journal of Mammology on Wednesday includes details and images of the lone vika that researchers were able to observe on Vangunu Island. Tyrone Lavery, a post-doctoral researcher at The Field Museum in Chicago and the lead author of the study, first heard rumors about vika during his first visit to Vangunu in 2010 and kept returning to the island, in search of it. The search became a race against time because deforestation was taking away vika's habitat -- the canopy of the island's rainforest. Lavery had two little clues along the way. The mention of \"vika\" in anthropologist Edvard Hviding's dictionary of the Marovo language , written 20 years ago, and when a team from the Australian Museum in Sydney went looking for the rat in 1992, nuts and coconuts with little holes cut out of them to extract the \"meat\" could be found on the island. Evidence of nuts with circular holes removed by rats in the Solomon Islands. Read More The rats had also become part of the local culture itself, appearing in songs and children's rhymes. \"Many of the native rodents found in Solomon Islands are featured in the culture of local people,\" Lavery said. \"People at Zaira [village on Vangunu Island] have a really detailed knowledge of this species that has been passed down over centuries through the oral history that is very strong in Melanesia.\" But vika remained elusive. The incredibly tall trees of the forest made the creature almost impossible to find. This required traps placed in the canopy and spotlighting -- both difficult in the dense rainforest. And the species itself seemed rare. An unfortunate accident revealed the creature for the first time in late 2015 to Lavery's co-author, Hikuna Judge, a wildlife ranger from the Zaira Conservation Area -- a conservation area run by the Zaira village. The vika, while it was still alive. \"It was taken from a tree that was cut down in forests that were being logged by a commercial company,\" Lavery said. \"It was injured when the tree was cut down and unfortunately died a short time after.\" Judge saw the animal while it was still alive and the research team knew it was different than the other eight known species of rat that can be found in the Solomon Islands. Unique biology The unique features of vika include orange-brown fur, short, round ears, a smooth tail with fine scales and broad back feet that enable it to walk along branches, Lavery said. It weighs just over 2 pounds and measures a foot and half in length. When compared to the average rat you might see in the city -- which weighs less than half a pound -- it's no wonder vika is considered a giant rat. The rainforest on Vangunu Island. It is closely related to three species of rat on the Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands: the ground-dwelling silvery emperor rat and red Guadalcanal rat, as well as the tree-dwelling silvery king rat. All of these rats have smooth tails with small scales on them. If these sound odd, it's to be expected among the animals found in the Solomon Islands. The network of islands about 1,000 miles northwest of Australia are isolated, but rich in species diversity. 'Goldilocks zone' The Solomon Islands are in the \"Goldilocks zone\" -- not too close but not too far away from New Guinea, which is quite diverse. It is believed that the ancestors of some of the rare animals that can only be found living in the Solomon Islands, like vika, migrated from the island of New Guinea or Australia by rafting on vegetation. Once arriving in the Solomon Islands, they evolved into a new species that adapted to the environment. Researchers still have many questions they want to answer about vika after finding just one of the species, but they are encouraged by the discovery. A watercolor illustration of the vika. \"We had been working hard to find this animal,\" Lavery said. \"Now that we have finally documented it, we hope it will attract additional support for the Zaira conservation area on southern Vangunu. Our best hope to preserve this animal is to support Zaira village. They are a community right next to where this species was found and they are very determined to preserve their forest against logging. He believes the discovery is important because it has documented an unknown mammal that can now be classified on the IUCN Red List [of Threatened Species] to help work out ways to save it, and seek financial support from donor agencies. \"It is also important in the context of the Solomon Islands. Prior to this, the Western Province was a big gap where no other species of rat where known to occur, so this helps us to understand how mammals evolved and diversified on these islands,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zaira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lavery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyrone lavery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edvard hviding", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "australian museum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iucn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vangunu island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new guinea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western province", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vangunu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guadalcanal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zaira conservation area", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "field museum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "solomon islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guadalcanal island", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T18:58:44.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a4be1f7eedf0d7056b31ec83d8ed600fcf3d612", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7S78AAIxIbn2i5HHSuFDWM_zY0Tk9Pg57BseDuv32KHMn4c8ZmYO0zXpasTQ4I.ITVMZ7ykfimVszmyy1.IKiNg-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Unseen photos of the struggle for Chicano rights - CNN Style", "title_full": "Unseen photos of the struggle for Chicano rights - CNN Style", "published": "2017-09-27T14:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.515, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170925153131-la-raza-autry-10-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 266, "comments": 0, "shares": 266}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a4be1f7eedf0d7056b31ec83d8ed600fcf3d612", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7S78AAIxIbn2i5HHSuFDWM_zY0Tk9Pg57BseDuv32KHMn4c8ZmYO0zXpasTQ4I.ITVMZ7ykfimVszmyy1.IKiNg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T14:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Unseen photos of the struggle for Chicano rights - CNN Style", "text": "'La Raza': A powerful vision of the struggle for Chicano rights Published 27th September 2017 'La Raza': A powerful vision of the struggle for Chicano rights Written by Christina Catherine Martinez, CNN Los Angeles 1967 was a turning point for the Los Angeles art scene. Ferus Gallery -- the iconoclastic Hollywood space that was the first to exhibit Andy Warhol's \"Campbell's Soup Cans\" -- had just closed its doors. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art initiated its short-lived Art and Technology program, which paired artists with corporations in fields like aerospace or scientific research. The nascent Southern California scene was shifting from its bohemian beginnings into a more institutional position, cementing its place in art history in the process. On the other side of town, the less glamorous fight for civil rights was reaching its pitch. The Chicano Movement, also known simply as \"El Movimiento,\" was a confluence of conflicts, from farmers' and labor rights, to youth-driven anti-discrimination efforts and anti-war protests, all under the banner of Mexican-American empowerment. The newly founded Chicano newspaper-turned-magazine La Raza served as a witness to and participant in this struggle for social justice in Los Angeles and beyond, with ground-breaking photography that married art, journalism and activism.

Curators Amy Scott and Luis C. Garza, a former La Raza photographer, sifted through the publication's previously unseen archive of over 25,000 negatives to present 200 of its most potent photographs, printed and mounted alongside reproductions of political cartoons, poetry and satire -- pieces that marked La Raza as a multifaceted document of the community that created it. Chicano activists were keenly aware of the importance of self-representation, using gestures like marches and sit-ins to gain media coverage and access, yet the tools of representation were still in the hands of a mass media that largely excluded people of color. As a result, portrayals of the movement were reduced to stereotypes of militant activists, or condescending tropes of helplessness. Related: Obama 'Hope' artist Shepard Fairey on the power of the peace sign The award-winning 1960 CBS documentary \"Harvest of Shame,\" for example, was a well-meaning call to action regarding the plight of migrant farmworkers in the United States, but its imagery was rooted in the quasi-anthropological tradition of photographers like Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange, who worked under the guidance of the Farm Security Administration -- an arm of the state that El Movimiento felt itself pitted against. According to Scott, the La Raza archive represents \"a radical turning point in history of Western photography, as it signaled a break from the camera as a tool of colonization.\" In taking the camera in their own hands, La Raza contributors turned that colonizing power on its head. From a loose network of about 20 photographers, both trained and untrained, working over the course of 10 years, there is a multitude of styles and aesthetics at work that collectively created an unprecedented visual language for activism and organizing.

Related: Basquiat: The radical graffiti artist who became an art-world legend This dizzying flip of the photographic gaze shows just how nuanced and prescient Chicano activists' understanding of representation was. At a time when access to the tools of representation were less readily available than today, La Raza simultaneously crafted an iconography of protest while complicating the stereotypes of the Chicano movement. Today, when information is not black or white but read all over and every which way, the themes of the \"La Raza\" exhibition couch its sprawling histories in both the personal and political, an approach that allows the exhibition's curators to acknowledge not only the complexity of La Raza's archive, but the open-ended nature of the work it began. \"This is not a definitive project\" Scott emphasizes. \"What we wanted to do was present a thematic introduction to the archive, perhaps like an index or a table of contents.\" In reality, she adds, \"there is a lifetime of scholarship in there.\" \"La Raza\" is on at the Autry Museum of the American West in Los Angeles until Feb. 20, 2019.

Tom Harkin to take stand in Menendez trial", "text": "Newark, New Jersey (CNN) A former federal health administrator told jurors that Sen. Bob Menendez's staff pressured officials for a favorable resolution in a multimillion-dollar Medicare dispute involving the senator's friend, as prosecutors continue to press their bribery case against the New Jersey Democrat.\nThe testimony largely eclipsed that of former Sen. Tom Harkin, a one-time Democratic presidential candidate, whom the prosecution also called to the stand Wednesday. Menendez defense team seeks to undercut theory of corrupt intent Prosecutors say Menendez pushed high-level federal officials to help his wealthy friend and co-defendant, Dr. Salomon Melgen, avoid $8.9 million in overbilling charges levied by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in exchange for luxury vacations, rides on private jets and other perks. The men maintain they broke no laws. One of Menendez's staffers was particularly \"persistent\" in advocating for the doctor on a telephone call with several agency officials in July 2009, according to Dr. Louis Jacques, a former director of coverage and analysis at CMS. Jacques testified that the staffer said \"the issue is very important to the senator, Melgen is a personal friend, bad medicine is not illegal, Medicare should pay these claims.\" Read More Jacques said he was so disturbed by the staffer's words and that he told the jury he got up from his seat to \"stretch\" and \"clear (my) head\" at the doorway. \"Aside from those particular statements, the call would have been entirely forgettable to me -- the reason why I remember it specifically are those statements,\" Jacques added. Melgen had been treating patients suffering from macular degeneration with a drug called Lucentis. Prosecutors say that federal regulations at the time approved the drug for \"single-use\" only, meaning that each vial should only be used for a single eye of a single patient, but the doctor used the \"overfill\" from the vials to treat up to three patients -- and then billed Medicare as if a separate vial was purchased for each dose. CMS hit Melgen with a formal repayment demand in 2009 to the tune of $8.9 million in alleged overbillings, at which point prosecutors say Menendez got involved, encouraging federal officials to help Melgen quash the charges, including Harkin -- then-chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which shared oversight responsibility over CMS and the Department of Health and Human Services. Poll: New Jersey voters say Sen. Menendez should quit if convicted Harkin, an Iowa Democrat who donned a blue blazer and khakis for a rare trial appearance, told jurors he agreed to meet with Melgen as a \"senatorial courtesy\" to Menendez, which was not unusual. And the former Senate colleagues appeared friendly in court Wednesday, as Harkin stopped at counsel table to smile and shake Menendez's hand before departing for the day. Melgen did most of the talking to \"present his side of the story\" during the 2011 meeting, while Menendez silently listened to the doctor describe \"a problem he was having with CMS,\" Harkin said, further elaborating on two specific takeaways. \"One, I was curious as to why the (Food and Drug Administration) would put so much of that medicine in a vial,\" Harkin said. \"I wondered about that. ... It sounds kind of odd.\" Earlier Wednesday the jury heard Jacques explain that splitting the vial among different patients, known as \"multi-dosing,\" created a risk of infection, but Harkin said that Melgen assured that he was using \"clean needles.\" \"I said the other part of it is, if he's treating three people, charging for three, but only paying for one (vial), that doesn't sound right either,\" Harkin added. Jenelle Krishnamoorthy, a former staffer for Harkin, further explained to the jury Wednesday that her boss took no action after the meeting despite later entreaties from a lobbyist whom she recalled also being in the room. Meet the judicial renegade overseeing Sen. Menendez's trial \"I felt that there was nothing more we could do or should do in this case,\" Krishnamoorthy told the jury, noting that it was somewhat unusual for an individual dispute -- originating from an someone outside of Iowa -- to be rise to this level. \"I would say in my 10 years, this was one of three that was like this,\" she said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laura jarrett", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tom harkin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "william walls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salomon melgen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melgen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob menendez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "menendez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbe lowell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "facebook mess", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cms", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centers for medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicaid services", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "menendez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T19:21:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93609192b57a1efc3167044a8322986b8a398dd3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsBCDI6wx2UKF27_0xW9bW.l1BWmB72ll50cpK9EVM3kBfyICId25Fhu3gRDeO.A94Cx2UqA62CXA-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - Politics", "title": "Analysis: Trump and McConnell are already having terrible weeks", "title_full": "Analysis: Trump and McConnell are already having terrible weeks", "published": "2017-09-27T18:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718125903-01-trump-mcconnell-health-care-file-0606-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 556, "comments": 0, "shares": 556}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "93609192b57a1efc3167044a8322986b8a398dd3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsBCDI6wx2UKF27_0xW9bW.l1BWmB72ll50cpK9EVM3kBfyICId25Fhu3gRDeO.A94Cx2UqA62CXA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T18:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Analysis: Trump and McConnell are already having terrible weeks", "text": "Roy Moore beats out candidate Trump supported 01:02 Washington (CNN) Consider the last 72 hours for President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The last-ditch attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act -- a promise eight years in the making for Republicans -- failed without even a floor vote . That failure ensures that, for the foreseeable future at least, Obamacare will remain the law of the land. Appointed Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, whom both men endorsed, lost badly in a Republican runoff to a candidate backed by Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, a McConnell ally and someone Trump urged just 12 days ago to run for a third term, decided against the race -- and, in so doing, created a potential headache for his party in the 2018 midterms. While Trump and McConnell suffered those indignities together, they each also had to deal with humiliations on their own over this three-day span. Read More Trump somehow managed to not only unite the NFL owners and players but also stoke racial tensions with a five-day long attack on professional athletes who protest during the national anthem. While he was distracted by his fight with the NFL, Trump also drew widespread criticism for his day-late-and-dollar-short handling of the devastation cause by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. And, oh yeah, special counsel Bob Mueller's investigation into Russia involvement in the 2016 election continued to pick up speed and widen its aperture . For McConnell, he must now grapple with what \"Senator Roy Moore\" could mean for his already-narrow majority. And deal with skittish incumbents up in 2018 worried that they will become the next Luther Strange. And deal with Trump who, according to CNN's White House team , is angry at McConnell for allegedly misleading him about Strange's chances of winning. (That may be the least surprising report of the year.) Then there's this final indignity: Outlets are reporting that Rick Pitino will be fired by the University of Louisville , McConnell's alma mater, later today. Welcome to Washington 2017! Consider that Trump and McConnell are, without question, the two most powerful Republicans in a Republican-dominated nation's capital. This should be the golden age for both men -- a time of unified Republican rule that should allow a series of conservative principles to flower. To date, however, the lone major accomplishment of this Republican dominance is the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. That's not a small thing but for an administration and a GOP congressional leadership who expected health care reform and tax reform to be done (or almost done) by this point, it's a major disappointment. And signs point to the road getting harder, not easier for McConnell and Trump. Tax reform, which Trump is expected to preview today in a speech in Indiana, will be no easy thing -- particularly given that a good chunk of the lobbying community in Washington is built around protecting this tax break or that one for a series of ultra-specialized industries. Plus, major -- and complex -- legislation is never as easy to move through Congress as people seem to think. Republicans need only look at their failed efforts on Obamacare to (re)learn that lesson. Bannon will be emboldened by Moore's victory -- as will the grassroots army he kind-of, sort-of commands. While recreating Alabama won't be as easy as some think -- Moore had been kicking around Alabama conservative circles for a very long time -- there's no question that the movement to get rid of people like Roger Wicker (Mississippi) and Dean Heller (Nevada) has more energy today than it did yesterday. Viewed at its most broad, what this week reflects is the relatively limited power of anyone -- up to and including the two leading Republicans in Washington -- to control the GOP right now. While Trump rode the anti-Washington/anti-politician wave to the Republican primary nomination, he neither created it nor is able to command it. (If he was, Strange would have won -- not lost by a bigger margin than in the first vote back in August.) In recent elections, McConnell appeared to have learned how to wrestle the activist party base to the ground following a series of damaging primary losses in 2010 and 2012. But, the rise of Moore -- and McConnell's unwillingness to spend the conservative firebrand into oblivion -- suggests that the distance between the GOP establishment and its base remains as wide as ever. What's been made very clear this week is that Trump's election wasn't the end of the populist revolt within the GOP. It was only the beginning. And that this revolt doesn't have a leader to whom everyone in it listens.

Seated alongside Microsoft president Brad Smith and nonprofit Code.org CEO Hadi Partovi in a classroom decorated with paper plate dreamcatchers and a Microsoft Surface at every seat, Trump encouraged the students to develop their coding skills, especially the young women. \"Right now, girls only make up 22% of the computer science field, but we're going to change that, right, ladies?\" she said. Read More Trump participated in a coding activity on a tablet alongside the students, asking a lot of questions. \"I have a little secret. My daughter and I have been starting to code together. She has been practicing more than me, and she reminds me of this every time we code together. But while she was in school today, I was here practicing with you. So tonight, I'm going to go home and I'm going to have some skills. I don't know, I may give her a little run,\" Trump joked at the assembly.

At an event in Detroit on Tuesday, tech leaders in the private sector announced an accompanying pledge of over $300 million for computer science programs. She worked on the initiative alongside the Education and Labor Departments, business leaders, educators, nonprofits and governors, with initial conversations starting during the presidential transition. This week, she spoke with more than 20 governors and superintendents to brief them on how to take advantage of the new grant funding, and she is expected to continue promoting STEM opportunities moving forward as part of her focus on workforce development.

Rather, let's talk about what people really want to know: How much did their mom, Kris Jenner, factor into this whole scenario? The internet can be a wild and ridiculous place, and it has already decided that Jenner has won the \"Momager of the Year\" award with three of her daughters possibly expecting kids at the same time.

But change can happen in Saudi Arabia", "text": "Eman Al Nafjan is the author of the Saudiwoman's Weblog , a blog on Saudi society, culture, women and human rights issues. She is based in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n(CNN) A couple of hours before the news broke that the ban on women driving in Saudi Arabia was finally being lifted , rumors had circulated that a decree on a women's issue was coming.\nI suspected it could be about the driving ban, but after years of campaigning to no success, I had nearly lost hope in it ever happening. For the past few of weeks, friends of mine have been planning parties in Jeddah, Riyadh, and Dammam to commemorate 27 years since the first protest against the ban. Since November 6, 1990, Saudi men and women have paid hefty prices for voicing their opposition to the ban on women driving in our country. Saudi women celebrate news they will finally be allowed to drive The unnecessary sacrifices of so many people crossed my mind as I read the tweets issued by the Saudi Press Agency announcing that the ban had been lifted. The manner in which the ban was lifted seemed too simple to be real. Read More Initially, I was overwhelmed with my own powerlessness as a woman living in a patriarchal absolute monarchy. Were our efforts the reason the ban was lifted? Or was it a decision that had been made regardless of our struggles? Still, my ringing phone and messages from friends pushed my frustrations aside, and I couldn't help but get caught up in everyone else's happiness. A friend told me how she heard the news while shopping at a mall. She said that complete strangers were informing and congratulating each other. Within minutes of the news breaking, silly misogynistic jokes about how women drive were being posted all over social media. Most of the jokes were about cars pimped out in pink and purple and about how tow trucks are going to be a sound investment when women start driving. But I was still too happy to be bothered and laughed along with everyone else. JUST WATCHED Saudi Arabia's Royal Family: What to know\nSaudi Arabia's Royal Family: What to know 01:13 While I am grateful that the government has finally allowed women the choice to drive, it is important to stop and think of all the men and women who have bravely stood against the state driving ban for the past 27 years: The 47 women who drove in protest in 1990 and the man who photographed them were all arrested. The women were suspended from their jobs and banned from travel while the man, Saleh Al-Azzaz, was imprisoned for months. Mohammed Al Zulfa in 2006 risked -- and eventually lost -- his lucrative position on the Saudi Majlis al-Shura, an unelected consultative council, after insisting that the ban be lifted. The woman who brought the issue to the world stage in 2011, Manal Al Sharif, told the Daily Mail Australia that she had to spend nine days in prison, lost her job -- and, most importantly, custody of her son. Maysaa Al Amoudi and Loujain Al Hathloul were charged as terrorists and spent 70 days in prison for using social media to post videos of their attempt to drive across the Saudi-UAE border. There are so many more names, but there are also so many who remain nameless. While the practical implications of lifting the ban on women driving are undeniable, they remain outweighed by the repercussions of its symbolism. Saudi Arabia to let women drive at last How can children consider their mother on the same footing as their father when she is treated as a minor every time the family gets into a car? How seriously could a teenager take his mother when he has more choice and control than her? Saudi women surgeons were entrusted with other people's lives in the operation room, but not with their own lives on the road. Now, with the driving ban lifted, other issues seem conquerable . The biggest issue at the moment is the guardianship system. Guardianship is a term used to describe the extreme patriarchy of Saudi bureaucracy. In practice, it can be a minor but insulting inconvenience, such as a university's requirement that female college students obtain a signed permission slip from their male guardian before joining any off-campus activities. In other cases, it can be as atrocious as being sentenced to months in prison on the indictment of \"filial disobedience.\" Over a year ago, an anti-guardianship social media campaign started , organized mainly by female college students and recent graduates. Most of these young activists are either victims of the guardianship system or witnesses to the suffering of friends and relatives. A breakthrough came when the Royal Court issued an order to all government agencies to create an inventory of all the regulations that limit women and revise them within three months from April 17th. We have yet to see what will come out of this order.

Rather, let's talk about what people really want to know: How much did their mom, Kris Jenner, factor into this whole scenario? The internet can be a wild and ridiculous place, and it has already decided that Jenner has won the \"Momager of the Year\" award with three of her daughters possibly expecting kids at the same time. Or as one person tweeted: \"Kim, Kylie, and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian all pregnant at once?

Related: Kris Jenner on the art of motherhood In 2015, the New York Times even profiled her in a piece titled, \"Where Would the Kardashians Be Without Kris Jenner?\" The answer, apparently, is not nearly as rich. Just this past Sunday, the family celebrated the 10th anniversary of \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" on E! with a special, naturally. There was no discussion of either a Kylie or Khlo\u00e9 pregnancy, but Kim did discuss fertility. \"Khlo\u00e9 and I had gone to a fertility doctor, and they said it would be really hard for me [to get pregnant],\" Kim said. \"So, I was about to freeze my eggs, and then I randomly got pregnant.\" \"I remember calling [Kanye] and he thought a family member of mine died I was so hysterical,\" she said. \"I thought my life was over, that I was pregnant, it was so hard for me,\" Kim added. \"Obviously it was the best thing that's ever happened to me.\" Now it looks like the best thing may have happened to two of her sisters as well. Not that any of the news comes without a bit of messiness because that's kind of where the Kardashians live. Baby sister Kylie's baby news Kylie, 20, is the baby of the family and reports of her pregnancy were met with confusion as to who the father could be. (She had been off and on with rapper Tyga for a few years.) But they reportedly ended their relationship and, in April, she is said to have taken up with current boyfriend, Travis Scott. A source close to the family told CNN Kylie is due in February. Neither Kylie or Scott have spoken publicly about a pregnancy. Then came Khlo\u00e9 Meanwhile, some fans haven't forgotten that Khlo\u00e9 was posting about her relationship with Cleveland Cavaliers player Thompson last year -- while his ex-girlfriend, Jordan Craig, was pregnant. Khloe pregnant and Tristan got a 9 month old with Jordy? Couldn't be me.\n\u2014 Brittani Michelle (@SpoiledRotten_3) September 27, 2017 Craig reportedly gave birth to their son in December. As of Wednesday morning, Khlo\u00e9, who has been very open about her struggle with infertility and quest to be a mom, has not confirmed her pregnancy nor had Thompson. It remains to be seen how all this baby news plays out, but it will almost certainly play out publicly (as most things Kardashian do).

She is based in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n(CNN) A couple of hours before the news broke that the ban on women driving in Saudi Arabia was finally being lifted , rumors had circulated that a decree on a women's issue was coming.\nI suspected it could be about the driving ban, but after years of campaigning to no success, I had nearly lost hope in it ever happening. For the past few of weeks, friends of mine have been planning parties in Jeddah, Riyadh, and Dammam to commemorate 27 years since the first protest against the ban. Since November 6, 1990, Saudi men and women have paid hefty prices for voicing their opposition to the ban on women driving in our country. Saudi women celebrate news they will finally be allowed to drive The unnecessary sacrifices of so many people crossed my mind as I read the tweets issued by the Saudi Press Agency announcing that the ban had been lifted. The manner in which the ban was lifted seemed too simple to be real. Read More Initially, I was overwhelmed with my own powerlessness as a woman living in a patriarchal absolute monarchy. Were our efforts the reason the ban was lifted? Or was it a decision that had been made regardless of our struggles? Still, my ringing phone and messages from friends pushed my frustrations aside, and I couldn't help but get caught up in everyone else's happiness. A friend told me how she heard the news while shopping at a mall. She said that complete strangers were informing and congratulating each other. Within minutes of the news breaking, silly misogynistic jokes about how women drive were being posted all over social media. Most of the jokes were about cars pimped out in pink and purple and about how tow trucks are going to be a sound investment when women start driving. But I was still too happy to be bothered and laughed along with everyone else. JUST WATCHED Saudi Arabia's Royal Family: What to know\nSaudi Arabia's Royal Family: What to know 01:13 While I am grateful that the government has finally allowed women the choice to drive, it is important to stop and think of all the men and women who have bravely stood against the state driving ban for the past 27 years: The 47 women who drove in protest in 1990 and the man who photographed them were all arrested. The women were suspended from their jobs and banned from travel while the man, Saleh Al-Azzaz, was imprisoned for months. Mohammed Al Zulfa in 2006 risked -- and eventually lost -- his lucrative position on the Saudi Majlis al-Shura, an unelected consultative council, after insisting that the ban be lifted. The woman who brought the issue to the world stage in 2011, Manal Al Sharif, told the Daily Mail Australia that she had to spend nine days in prison, lost her job -- and, most importantly, custody of her son. Maysaa Al Amoudi and Loujain Al Hathloul were charged as terrorists and spent 70 days in prison for using social media to post videos of their attempt to drive across the Saudi-UAE border. There are so many more names, but there are also so many who remain nameless. While the practical implications of lifting the ban on women driving are undeniable, they remain outweighed by the repercussions of its symbolism. Saudi Arabia to let women drive at last How can children consider their mother on the same footing as their father when she is treated as a minor every time the family gets into a car? How seriously could a teenager take his mother when he has more choice and control than her? Saudi women surgeons were entrusted with other people's lives in the operation room, but not with their own lives on the road. Now, with the driving ban lifted, other issues seem conquerable . The biggest issue at the moment is the guardianship system. Guardianship is a term used to describe the extreme patriarchy of Saudi bureaucracy. In practice, it can be a minor but insulting inconvenience, such as a university's requirement that female college students obtain a signed permission slip from their male guardian before joining any off-campus activities. In other cases, it can be as atrocious as being sentenced to months in prison on the indictment of \"filial disobedience.\" Over a year ago, an anti-guardianship social media campaign started , organized mainly by female college students and recent graduates. Most of these young activists are either victims of the guardianship system or witnesses to the suffering of friends and relatives. A breakthrough came when the Royal Court issued an order to all government agencies to create an inventory of all the regulations that limit women and revise them within three months from April 17th. We have yet to see what will come out of this order.

They say they reached out to the agency earlier this week but didn't hear back. Puerto Ricans still waiting for aid a week after Maria's devastation The act was quickly lifted to help Texas and Florida in the wake of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. DHS said it was able to lift the restrictions quickly because the Department of Defense requested a waiver for those states and the department hasn't yet done so for Puerto Rico. DHS spokesman David Lapan said US Customs and Border Protection has no pending official waiver request regarding Puerto Rico and that the story is \"just not true.\" \"We do not lack US-flagged vessel capacity to move commodities to Puerto Rico,\" Lapan said. Read More Asked to comment, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said such a waiver is not yet needed. A senior administration official said Wednesday the White House does not expect DHS to make a decision on the waiver request by the end of the day, citing the consideration process. In a conference call with reporters Wednesday morning, senior DHS officials acknowledged the congressional request after having denied previously that a request was made. \"We have received a request from members of Congress -- which is not a normal way that waiver requests come in -- but we're going to evaluate the issues they've raised,\" a senior DHS official said. \"Our general counsel is evaluating whether members of Congress have standing to request such a waiver.\" DHS has not responded to the members of Congress who made the request, the senior officials said on the call, with one adding that the agency would \"evaluate the merits of the arguments they've raised.\" Democrats say they contacted acting DHS chief Elaine Duke via both email and traditional mail on Monday, according to a spokesperson for Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, D-New York, who spearheaded the outreach. Duke acknowledged on Wednesday that she received the request. A spokesperson for Vel\u00e1zquez told CNN earlier Wednesday that DHS had not acknowledged the request. On the call, DHS officials said the request was being acted on. \"It smacks of bureaucratic ineptitude that they would be dithering with issues of standing while a humanitarian crisis is unfolding,\" a spokesperson for Vel\u00e1zquez told CNN about the DHS response. \"This is a humanitarian crisis, and Puerto Rico needs all the help it can get,\" the congresswoman said. \"This includes ensuring any and all maritime assets can access the island to deliver aid, regardless of their Jones Act status. Furthermore, given the devastation from Maria, it is clear that Puerto Rico's already-struggling economy will face a difficult road ahead. My letter requested a one-year exemption to the Jones Act to help stimulate economic activity and alleviate hardship on the Island by reducing the cost of basic goods.\" 3 storms, 3 responses: Comparing Harvey, Irma and Maria The nearly century-old Jones Act is a law that requires that all goods shipped between ports of the United States be carried by vessels built, owned and operated by Americans. As a result, it limits shipping between coasts.

And radio networks used routinely by police officers, power company workers and other first responder still were down. No gas. No food. No power. Puerto Ricans fear their future Yet, a key mode of communication -- one not reliant on infrastructure vulnerable to strong winds and flooding -- still crackled: the \"ham\" radio. Answering the phone that night in Connecticut was the emergency manager for the American Radio Relay League, the group's CEO said. For more than a century, this group has served as a hub for amateurs licensed to operate the dependable, if archaic, medium known as ham radio and eager to pitch in when disaster strikes. Read More When the Red Cross made its latest appeal for heroes, these were the people it had in mind. Jumping to respond to disaster Already gearing up on his own that night to go to work, turning knobs and flipping switches, was Oscar Resto. As one of dozens of ham -- shorthand for \"amateur\" -- operators across Puerto Rico, Resto had been authorized by the Federal Communications Commission to use radios, computers, satellites or the Internet to assist and support public safety during emergencies . Often untethered from wires and cables, operators share information by voice, Morse code and other methods on a wide range of frequencies above the AM broadcast band. Such communications were critical during rescue operations after the 9/11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina . Oscar Resto works with another volunteer to pass along information at the Red Cross headquarters in San Juan, Puerto Rico. For three days after Maria hit, Resto sawed through the downed trees that separated his home from the road, he told CNN. Then he packed his car with radio gear, left his family and made the 25-mile journey to a makeshift Red Cross headquarters, where generators and batteries could power his equipment. \"I have the responsibility to establish the required emergency communications that the American Red Cross needed for understanding the needs of the citizens impacted by the hurricane,\" said Resto, a section manager for the American Radio Relay League , which boasts 160,000 members. Survivors needed food, water, shelter and fuel to power generators after Maria knocked out the entire electrical grid. They also needed to communicate, to share critical information about diabetics nearing the end of their insulin reserves , babies threatened by dehydration, families rationing crackers . Transmitting radio signals to other ham operators in the Caribbean, Resto and his shortwave brethren traded National Hurricane Center reports on Maria's position. He also contacted a ham operator in Florida, and asked \"just to tell my daughter, Astrid, that we were fine,\" he recalled. Before long, Resto and his compatriots realized their messages were the only ones getting off the island. In an instant, their mission expanded: Anyone with the requisite skills and equipment was conscripted. Shoulder to shoulder with first responders Two ham volunteers, Raul Gonzalez and Jose Santiago, set up a radio control hub run by generator power in Monacillo, near San Juan, and other centers quickly followed suit. There, ham operators work shoulder to shoulder with public safety and utility officials to transmit information to other ham operators working with teams in the field. Puerto Rico governor: Power could be out for months A full week after Maria battered their homes, Resto and two dozen other Puerto Rican ham operators were still running radio operations for the police and the local power company, whose own wireless communications systems rely in part on computers and power sources knocked out by the storm. For instance, ham operators riding with police use radios tuned to the special broadcast frequencies to transmit calls to other ham operators hunkered down at the command centers with officers, who in turn respond with orders. A power company generator low on fuel? A ham operator from Resto's team deployed with the power company calls his counterpart at the command center and coordinates a fuel delivery. Raul Gonzalez and Jose Santiago work to maintain the communication infrastructure they set up between ham radio operators in the Monacillo Control Center. For his part, Resto learned Tuesday via a ham radio at the command center that an unsanitary hospital in western Puerto Rico was transferring patients to another hospital. It was just one of countless threads of information squawked across the operational frequencies in a massive effort to deliver relief and supplies. \"I am very proud of them,\" Resto said of his crew of amateurs. \"They are the real heroes.\" More help on the way Less than 48 hours after the American Radio Relay League's emergency manager fielded the Red Cross' call, 350 ham operators had offered to help, said Tom Gallagher, the group's CEO. Fifty of them prepared this week to embark upon a three-week deployment to Puerto Rico. They include retired executives and public safety officers, and hail from places from Washington to Texas to New Hampshire, he said. \"It's an incredibly personal sacrifice from individuals who are dedicated to serving communities,\" Gallagher said. \"They have the skills and the motivation and the sense of responsibility.\" Volunteers will deploy to the island with equipment kits so they can be agile and provide for themselves. Volunteers will be outfitted with self-sustaining kits provided by radio manufacturers and dealer partners so they can be agile and won't burden those they're trying to help, he said. Southwest Airlines was due to transport the equipment for free Wednesday from the group's New York headquarters to Atlanta, where volunteers planned to convene Thursday to board a chartered JetBlue flight for San Juan, Gallagher said. There, they plan to connect with the Red Cross and likely spread out across Puerto Rico to continue the life-saving work of radio operators already well underway, Gallagher said. \"It's the first time they've asked us to do this on this scale,\" he said. \"This is why we're here.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maria", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "morse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom gallagher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oscar resto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gallagher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raul gonzalez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "resto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose santiago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "astrid", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "american radio relay league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal communications commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red cross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southwest airlines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "resto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jetblue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national hurricane center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico fifty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hampshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monacillo control center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monacillo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T19:44:57.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12b27e0e60a7c87845aebd608ebe171eb4df0ceb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWFQa39qxV0hWv5EfgWVM69M_AoDDYQ8soDUSxBggUM9iUid0_dk6bj8", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Petition demands Baltimore Ravens take down Ray Lewis' statue after his anthem protest - CNN", "title_full": "Petition demands Baltimore Ravens take down Ray Lewis' statue after his anthem protest - CNN", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170924092945-01-nfl-kneeling-0924-screengrab-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 14495, "comments": 0, "shares": 14495}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "12b27e0e60a7c87845aebd608ebe171eb4df0ceb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWFQa39qxV0hWv5EfgWVM69M_AoDDYQ8soDUSxBggUM9iUid0_dk6bj8", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Doug Criss", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Petition demands Baltimore Ravens take down Ray Lewis' statue after his anthem protest - CNN", "text": "(CNN) The backlash against the #TakeAKnee movement is now hitting a retired NFL legend.\nMore than 30,000 people have signed a petition urging the removal of Ray Lewis' statue from in front of M&T Bank Stadium, home of the NFL's Baltimore Ravens. Lewis knelt with other Ravens players during the playing of the National Anthem before the team's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday in London. That didn't sit well with some fans, despite his iconic status with the franchise. Lewis played all 17 of his NFL seasons with the Ravens and helped the team win two Super Bowls. He retired in 2012. A Change.org petition soon popped up online urging Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti to take down the bronze statue of Lewis, which was erected in 2014 and depicts him doing his signature pre-game dance. Extra security has been hired to watch over the statue, CNN affiliate WJZ reports. Read More Other side angry too Lewis told a Baltimore sports radio station he wasn't dissing the flag or the anthem when he took a knee. \"I would never protest against my flag,\" he told WJZ-FM. \"It's just me. I do too much for my country. I do too much for my city. I've invested my life into making people around me better, and the people less fortunate than me.\" Lewis said he got on his knees because he has a First Amendment right to protest \"just like everybody else.\" But Lewis has also caught flak from those who support the football players' protests. In August, Lewis posted a video to TMZ Sports in which he said ex-NFL QB Colin Kaepernick -- who started the protests last year -- shouldn't use the football field as a venue to promote social change. So he's being slammed as a hypocrite by some, including former teammate Shannon Sharpe, who blasted Lewis on his show on Fox Sports 1.

Planes are leaving, just not enough to clear the terminal any time soon. Eighteen round-trip commercial passenger flights are scheduled Wednesday, according to the company that manages the airport. That is almost double the number from Monday and Tuesday but a fraction of a normal day. \nPeople are desperate to flee Puerto Rico since it was ravaged by Hurricane Maria a week ago, leaving most of the island without power and plunging it into a humanitarian crisis. \nRelated: A night of desperation in San Juan's sweltering airport \nInside the airport terminal, generators are providing the only power, and there is no air conditioning. Heat, humidity and the crush of bodies make it feel like more than 100 degrees. \n\"We just want to get home and get back to our routines, our lives. I don't feel safe here,\" said Doris Montalvo, who was at the airport Tuesday night, trying to get home to Connecticut with her daughter, three grandchildren and her daughter's boyfriend. \nShe said she was told she might not get on a flight for two weeks. \nBesides commercial flights, some humanitarian relief flights are getting into San Juan. Airlines are delivering food, water, medicine, blankets, cots, generators and blood for the Red Cross. \nRelated: Hurricane Maria is a nightmare for Puerto Rico's economy \nCharter, military and cargo planes are also delivering supplies for FEMA. The FAA reported almost 100 takeoffs and landings in all on Tuesday and said it should be able to handle 36 an hour during daylight on Wednesday as it repairs damaged radar. \nUnited Airlines ( UAL ) said relief flights are returning with as many people as can get on the plane. United also resumed scheduled passenger service on Wednesday for the first time since the storm. \nWith takeoff and landing slots limited, airlines say they are also using larger planes than normal to handle more people. American Airlines ( AAL ) used widebody jets on two of three round-trip flights Tuesday, instead of the normal single-aisle jets.

Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic commissioner, questioned the agency's choice not to call for hearings yet to inform its response in the wake of a series of devastating hurricanes. \"After Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy @FCC held hearings to address network recovery. Why won't agency do it for Harvey, Irma & Maria?\" she wrote on Twitter ( TWTR , Tech30 ) Tuesday. \nThe three hurricanes knocked out cellular, cable and Internet services for millions of Americans over the past month. Hurricane Maria's impact on Puerto Rico has been particularly brutal. Only 20% of Puerto Rico's cell towers are functioning, according to Luis Romero, VP of the Puerto Rico Telecommunications Alliance. \n\"These are people struggling to make phone calls in the United States. @FCC must study networks in disaster. Stat,\" Rosenworcel said. \nIn 2012, the FCC announced hearings within weeks of Hurricane Sandy. These hearings were used to gather information to help strengthen communications networks and guide future response efforts. \nBut hearings can sometimes result in additional regulation for the industry, which critics suggest could be a point of concern for the current FCC. Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman appointed by Trump, has been focused on scrapping regulations . \n\"Frankly, I think Pai is worried ... that hearings will point to problems the FCC needs to solve through regulation,\" says Harold Feld, SVP at Public Knowledge, an advocacy group. \nRelated: Here's how Trump's FCC affects you \nIn response to the criticism, the FCC says it is currently focused on the urgent recovery effort at hand in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. \n\"There has been devastating damage to the communications infrastructure there, and that's where we must focus our immediate attention,\" an FCC spokesperson said in a statement. \"Once this crisis has passed, the Chairman looks forward to considering the ideas on next steps offered by all of his colleagues. \nPai visited Houston and South Florida after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma to meet with first responders. He hopes to visit Puerto Rico \"when conditions permit,\" according to the FCC spokesperson. \n\"I see a lot of lip service,\" says Rear Admiral David Simpson, who oversaw the FCC's Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau during the previous administration. \"I see the chairman flying to the affected areas, but then I don't see any tangible actions afterward.\" \nSimpson stresses that the terrain and infrastructure in Puerto Rico requires urgent assessment of how to proceed. \n\"I don't see where the FCC has done any kind of a rapid triage in what the unique issues are for Puerto Rico,\" he says. \"There needs to be a rapid assessment of the market's capacity in Puerto Rico to recover from this.\" \nThe FCC spokesperson said Pai has \"talked directly\" with officials from the major carriers in Puerto Rico. Pai has also reached out to FEMA about getting fuel and generators delivered to communications providers. \n\"The FCC has also regularly been conveying requests for assistance from communications providers to those federal partners who are able to help,\" the spokesperson said. \nCorrection: An earlier version of this article cited a former FCC official saying the commission should set up a multi-agency task force on Puerto Rico .

Bob Corker said Tuesday he'd retire after his term wraps next year His cited reasons for stepping down are odd by the traditional D.C. standards Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has turned Washington upside down. In ways big and small, with implications tiny and vast, the campaign that delivered Trump the White House -- and the way he has acted since arriving in Washington eight months ago -- has totally upended conventional wisdom about what politicians say and do. The latest example is the decision Tuesday by Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican, to retire after two terms . In his announcement, Corker cited his commitment to being a citizen legislator as the driving force behind his decision. \"When I ran for the Senate in 2006, I told people that I couldn't imagine serving for more than two term,\" he said. \"Understandably, as we have gained influence, that decision has become more difficult. But I have always been drawn to the citizen legislator model, and while I realize it is not for everyone, I believe with the kind of service I provide, it is the right one for me.\" Read More Which is fine! But also odd by the traditional standards of Washington. After all, the term limits movement long ago lost any of the perceived power it had to call out members who broke their pledges to serve some sort of set time in Washington. More importantly, Republicans are not only in the majority in the Senate through 2018 but, given the map next November, could well add a few seats to that majority heading into the next Congress. Corker still had two years -- after 2018 -- left on his term as chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee. And, if Republicans held onto their majority in 2020, he would have been the chairman of the influential banking committee and a powerful player on the budget committee as well. In the old days, NO member of the majority party with as many prominent committee seats as Corker would have even considered retiring. It just wasn't done. Plus, Corker was an ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and someone who -- until recently -- enjoyed a relatively friendly relationship with the Trump White House. Corker was considered as a vice presidential nominee in 2016 and mentioned for a slot as secretary of state in Trump's Cabinet. And, at 65, Corker is positively a spring chicken in the Senate. Against all of those positives, Corker's explanation that he simply wanted to stay true to his roots as a citizen legislator rings hollow. Or, more accurately, it rings incomplete. The simple fact is that life in Trump's Washington -- and Trump's Republican Party -- is just no fun for a guy like Corker. While he's a conservative, he's no ideologue. He developed a reputation as a dealmaker shortly after coming to Washington and has worked to maintain that rep in his 11 years in the chamber. Of Corker, The Tennessean wrote in 2013 : \"The Tennessee Republican has been a point man on banking reform, with President Barack Obama endorsing the proposal he developed with Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. His amendment to increase spending on security along the US-Mexican border helped win passage in the Senate of an immigration bill that is loathed deeply by tea party activists.\" That profile has become increasingly unattractive to Republican primary voters. Corker faced the likelihood of a challenge next year form his ideological right -- spurred on by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. He would have started as the favorite in that race but a win was far from certain. Then there is the more-difficult-to-quantify stress and strain of being a pragmatic and policy-focused Republican in Trump's Washington. For Corker, who thinks big policy thoughts and wants to find ways to make government work, Trump's unpredictability and yo-yoing moods -- as expressed via tweet -- had to be frustrating. He let that frustration slip last month while talking to reporters in Tennessee. \"The President has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful,\" said Corker . \"We should hope that (Trump) aspires that he does some self-reflection, that he does what is necessary to demonstrate stability, to demonstrate competence, to demonstrate that he understands the character of our nation and works daily to bring out the best of the people in our nation.\" Trump -- natch! -- attacked Corker on Twitter for those comments. \"Strange statement by Bob Corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in '18,\" tweeted Trump . \"Tennessee not happy!\" The prospect of six more years of answering questions from reporters day in and day out that began \"Did you see Trump's tweet ...\" was surely not one that Corker relished.

The threat of global annihilation may feel as present as it did during the Cold War, but today's high-security shelters could not be more different from their 20th-century counterparts. A number of companies around the world are meeting a growing demand for structures that protect from any risk, whether it's a global pandemic, an asteroid, or World War III -- while also delivering luxurious amenities. \"Your father or grandfather's bunker was not very comfortable,\" says Robert Vicino , a real estate entrepreneur and CEO of Vivos , a company he founded that builds and manages high-end shelters around the world. \"They were gray. They were metal, like a ship or something military. And the truth is mankind cannot survive long-term in such a Spartan, bleak environment.\" 1/22 \u2013 The Oppidum, Czech Republic The demand for designer bunkers has grown rapidly in recent years. Credit: the oppidum Doomsday demand Many of the world's elite, including hedge fund managers, sports stars and tech executives (Bill Gates is rumored to have bunkers at all his properties) have chosen to design their own secret shelters to house their families and staff. Gary Lynch, general manager of Texas-based Rising S Company , says 2016 sales for their custom high-end underground bunkers grew 700% compared to 2015, while overall sales have grown 300% since the November US presidential election alone. Related: Apocalypse now: Our incessant desire to picture the end of the world The company's plate steel bunkers, which are designed to last for generations, can hold a minimum of one year's worth of food per resident and withstand earthquakes. But while some want to bunker down alone, others prefer to ride out the apocalypse in a community setting that offers an experience a bit closer to the real world. 1/17 \u2013 Five-star shelter A secret bunker in South-East London, built to protect key government employees during a nuclear winter, has been transformed into a $4 million luxury residence. Credit: JDM estate agents Developers of community shelters like these often acquire decommissioned military bunkers and missile silos built by the United States or Soviet governments -- sites that would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build today. The fortified structures are designed to withstand a nuclear strike and come equipped with power systems, water purification systems, blast valves, and Nuclear-Biological-Chemical (NBC) air filtration. Most include food supplies for a year or more, and many have hydroponic gardens to supplement the rations. The developers also work to create well-rounded communities with a range of skills necessary for long-term survival, from doctors to teachers. Vicino says Vivos received a flurry of interest in its shelters around the 2016 election from both liberals and conservatives, and completely sold out of spaces in its community shelters in the past few weeks. Designer ark One of those shelters, Vivos xPoint , is near the Black Hills of South Dakota, and consists of 575 military bunkers that served as an Army Munitions Depot until 1967. Presently being converted into a facility that will accommodate about 5,000 people, the interiors of each bunker are outfitted by the owners at a cost of between $25,000 to $200,000 each. The price depends on whether they want a minimalist space or a home with high-end finishes. The compound itself will be equipped with all the comforts of a small town, including a community theater, classrooms, hydroponic gardens, a medical clinic, a spa and a gym. Vivos Europa One in GermanyCredit: \u00a9 Copyright Terravivos.com For clients looking for something further afield and more luxurious, the company also offers Vivos Europa One , billed as a \"modern day Noah's Ark\" in a former Cold War-era munitions storage facility in Germany. The structure, which was carved out of solid bedrock, offers 34 private residences, each starting at 2,500 square feet, with the option to add a second story for a total of 5,000 square feet. Stunning mural appears in secret forest The units will be delivered empty and each owner will have the space renovated to suit their own tastes and needs, choosing from options that include screening rooms, private pools and gyms. Vicino compares the individual spaces to underground yachts, and even recommends that owners commission the same builders and designers that worked on their actual vessels. \"Most of these people have high-end yachts, so they already have the relationship and they know the taste, fit, and finish that they want,\" he explains. The vast complex includes a tram system to transport residents throughout the shelter, where they can visit its restaurants, theater, coffee shops, pool and game areas. \"We have all the comforts of home, but also the comforts that you expect when you leave your home,\" Vicino adds.

Super-rich building luxury doomsday bunkers \"Our clients are sold on the unique advantage of having a luxury second home that also happens to be a nuclear hardened bunker,\" says Hall, who is already starting work on a second Survival Condo in another silo on site. \"This aspect allows our clients to invest in an appreciating asset as opposed to an expense.\" The Survival Condo has several different layouts, from a 900-square-foot half-floor residence to a two-level, 3,600-square-foot penthouse that starts at $4.5 million. Owners have access to their homes and the facilities at anytime, whether a disaster is imminent or they just want to get away from it all, and the complex features a pool, general store, theater, bar and library. The condo association sets the rules for the community, and during an emergency, owners would be required to work four hours a day. Long-term luxury If you prefer to spend the end of days solo, or at least with hand-selected family and friends, you may prefer to consider The Oppidum in the Czech Republic, which is being billed as \"the largest billionaire bunker in the world.\" The top-secret facility, once a joint project between the former Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic and Slovakia), was built over 10 years beginning in 1984. An interior shot of the Oppidum in Czech RepublicCredit: Courtesy of the Oppidum The site now includes both an above-ground estate and a 77,000-square-foot underground component. While the final product will be built out to the owner's specifications, the initial renderings include an underground garden, swimming pool, spa, cinema and wine vault. While many might see the luxury amenities at these facilities as unnecessary, the developers argue that these features are critical to survival. \"These shelters are long-term, a year or more,\" Vicino says. \"It had better be comfortable.\" Advertise Terms of Use Privacy Policy Cookies AdChoices \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network.

It said migrant workers in other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries -- Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- were also vulnerable as statutory summer work breaks were not linked to actual weather conditions. Generally, government regulations prohibit workers in Qatar from working outdoors between 11:30am and 3pm from June 15 to August 31. JUST WATCHED Qatar's World Cup ambitions\nQatar's World Cup ambitions 07:10 But, in a statement, HRW said weather conditions in Qatar outside those times frequently reach levels that can result in \"potentially fatal heat-related illnesses in the absence of appropriate rest.\" Read More \"Limiting work hours to safe temperatures -- not set by a clock or calendar -- is well within the capacity of the Qatari government and will help protect hundreds of thousands of workers,\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. Sheik Saif Al Thani, director of the Government Communications Office, told CNN in a statement that Qatar was committed to is labor reform program and was constantly reviewing its policies to ensure that \"migrant workers receive the necessary on-site protections.\" He said Qatar was the first Gulf country to implement restrictions on summer working hours and that these daily restrictions \"exceeded those of Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\" \"In addition to issuing harsh financial penalties,\" he continued. \"Qatar is also the only country in the Gulf that shuts down companies that are found to be operating in violation of the ban.\" READ: 2022 World Cup a bargaining chip fro Gulf foes 'Unexplained causes of death' Migrant labor accounts for 95% of Qatar's total labor workforce, with 40% or 800,000 of these workers employed in construction, according to the HRW report. Qatar was announced as the host city for the 2022 World Cup in December 2010 and has since embarked on a huge infrastructure campaign in preparation for football's biggest tournament, spending nearly $500m a week on World Cup projects according to Qatari authorities. JUST WATCHED Qatar 2022: 'Progress made on worker rights'\nQatar 2022: 'Progress made on worker rights' 02:03 In 2013, the Qatari government revealed that 520 workers from Bangladesh, India and Nepal died in 2012 -- 385 of them from unexplained causes. Last year, authorities told HRW that 35 workers had died, mostly from falls. HRW recommended that the government of Qatar release data on migrant worker deaths for the past five years, including cause of death which would \"allow an assessment to the extent to which heat stress is a factor.\" Sheik Thani said the government submitted statistics on all work-related deaths in Qatar for 2016 to the International Labour Organization (ILO), which is publicly available on their website. \"We continue to co-ordinate closely with the ILO and international NGOs to implement reforms that will improve the health, safety and rights of migrant workers,\" he said 'Authorities need to scale up transparency' Qatar's World Cup organizers, the \"Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy,\" says it's attempting to enact higher welfare standards than are generally applied to migrant workers in Qatar, last year introducing work-to-rest ratios which were in proportion with the risk posed by heat and humidity. But HRW said that applied to only about 1.5% of the country's construction workforce and did not take into account the effect of sunlight which, according to the statement, significantly increased the risk of heat stress. \"As Qatar scales up its FIFA World Cup construction projects, authorities need to scale up transparency about worker deaths that could be heat related, and take urgent steps to end risks to workers from heat,\" Whitson said. Of a total of 10 worker deaths on World Cup projects between October 2015 and July 2017, the Supreme Committee classified eight deaths as \"non-work related\" with seven of the deaths resulting from \"cardiac arrest\" and \"acute respiratory failure.\" An artist's impression of the Al Rayyan Stadium, a host venue for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar. HRW said such terms made it \"impossible to determine\" whether those deaths were related to working conditions, such as heat stress. In a statement issued on its website, the Supreme Committee said it acknowledged the concerns raised by HRW and had discussed those concerns \"at length\" with HRW representatives over the last few weeks. The statement read: \"However, we whole-heartedly refute the suggestion the SC has \"abdicated responsibility\" or that the SC has failed to protect the lives of workers on our projects. \"To date there have been two work-related fatalities and nine non-work related deaths of workers engaged on our projects. The SC profoundly regrets the death of any worker, and we treat every incident with the utmost seriousness. \"However, the SC does not have the authority or mandate to determine cause of death, which is reflected in death certificates issued by the medical authorities in Qatar... The SC investigates all fatalities on SC sites to establish whether they could have been prevented and, if so, to identify improvements for the future. \"The SC has provided HRW with the information requested concerning the circumstances surrounding non-work related deaths on our projects.\" Further criticisms The HRW statement also criticized the Qatari government's failure to implement two key recommendations of a 2014 report by the international law firm DLA Piper, which the government itself had commissioned. DLA Piper had reported that the number of deaths in Qatar attributed to cardiac arrest was \"seemingly high\" and had called for legal reform in the country to allow postmortem examinations in cases of unexpected or sudden deaths, and an independent study into the deaths \"vaguely attributed to cardiac arrest.\" \"Qatar sought the spotlight by bidding for the 2022 World Cup, brought in hundreds of thousands of migrant workers to build roads, stadiums, and hotels, and then shelved key recommendations from their own consultants to investigate migrant worker deaths,\" added Whitson. \"FIFA and national football associations should make clear they expect life-saving changes to law and practice that could set a Gulf-wide example of how to save construction worker lives now -- and in the future.\" FIFA 'Fully committed' FIFA told CNN it was \"fully committed\" to protecting the rights of construction workers involved in building infrastructure for the World Cup in Qatar. A FIFA spokesperson said it was working closely with the Supreme Committee, adding that health and safety and workers' protection measures put in place by the committee met the \"highest international standards.\" \"Contrary to the implications made by Human Rights Watch in its statement, the vast majority of construction work currently undertaken in Qatar is not linked to the 2022 FIFA World Cup,\" the spokesperson continued. \"As part of their National Vision 2030, Qatar started a wide-ranging and ambitious (program) to develop its national infrastructure well before and independent of the awarding of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

He takes that very seriously and has taken it to heart,\" HHS press secretary Caitlin Oakley said in a statement. \"The IG is going through a review and an audit of this process which we fully support.\" Oakley also said Price \"has initiated an internal departmental review of the procedures and processes that we go through for official travel to determine whether there are any changes or reforms that are necessary,\" and added that Price remains focused on his job. \"At the same time, the secretary and the department continues to work day and night to protect and enhance the health and well-being of the American people -- for example, providing assistance and medical care to Americans affected by the recent hurricanes and partnering with state and local community leaders to combat the opioid epidemic in America,\" Oakley said. The issue came to the forefront after reports revealed that several of the President's Cabinet secretaries, notably Price, chartered private planes on the federal dime. HHS Secretary Price: No business trips on private planes while matter is reviewed The Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general is investigating Price's decision to opt for private charter planes instead of commercially available means of travel. Politico first reported Price's use of charter jets for official business earlier this month, and followed that article with another that said the secretary has traveled on charter flights at least 24 times since May , citing people familiar with his travel plans and a review of HHS documents. Charter plane operators estimated 24 flights would have cost $300,000, Politico reported. Commercial trips would have cost thousands of dollars less. Asked Wednesday whether he has confidence in Price, Trump declined to offer a clear answer, saying only that he is \"looking into it.\" And would he fire Price? \"We'll see,\" Trump offered. The President's blunt words underscored his strong displeasure toward Price that could ultimately lead to his dismissal. Yet one administration official noted that Trump has also been furious at Attorney General Jeff Sessions and several other top advisers who he has not fired.

This place is right around the corner from Riyadh's infamous \"Chop Chop\" square where criminals are routinely executed by sword. It's a pretty sensitive location. You just don't see Saudi kids doing that outdoors anywhere and getting away with it, let alone there. Religious police would round them up in no time. Admittedly, the dancing was on the heels of Saudi National Day when spirits typically run high, but never has the Saudi leadership let its leash on public restraint run so loose. Read More Women in Saudi Arabia still can't do these things This is a country built on conservative teachings, grown out of a desert culture so harsh that when loved ones die, their graves are left unmarked. Still, when I read the announcement that Saudi women were to be given the right to drive , part of me was not too surprised. It fits the recent mood music around Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's 2030 vision for change in the Kingdom. The Crown Prince wants to bring more women into the workplace, in an effort to diversify and boost the economy -- allowing women to drive is a way of accelerating that vision. The decision also comes at a time when Saudi Arabia is under increasing international scrutiny, not just because of the civilian toll from its war in Yemen, but also as a result of tensions with Iran, a sudden rift with former Gulf ally Qatar, even bin Salman's promotion over the head of his uncle to be next in line to replace his father, King Salman. Regardless of why, the change has been building behind the scenes for a while now -- ministers and teams replaced, other more subtle shakeups -- but it was never quite clear where it was leading. It's still not clear. We'll have to see how the decision to let women drive is put in place before we can draw firm conclusions. Women's rights Of all the subjects that I've covered in reporting on Saudi Arabia down the years, the one I've spent most time on is women's rights: from female campaigners behind the wheel, to bloggers, to upper-class activists who bend the King's ear to push for change, to young aspirational women in school and out on their first job beholden to their father's whim on the limits of their travel and achievement. For many of these women, driving is not the biggest issue . Far more important are basic rights to equal a man's, like the right not to need a male guardian's permission to set foot out of the house. One thing that came up time and again from men and some women was the question, what does a woman do when her car breaks down? Of course, this starts from the misogynist's view that a woman won't be able to change a tire or fix a faulty headlamp at the roadside. A Saudi woman prepares to get into a taxi on a main street in the Saudi coastal city of Jeddah on September 27, 2017. But the answer most gave runs like this: If she is alone in the car, how can she ask for help unless her guardian, a male family member, is with her? Talking to a male outside her family it could bring dishonor, even violent retribution. The subtext is that women out alone might not be safe, subject not to the laws of the land but to the capricious mores of a conservative, tribal society. When you consider driving in that context it's hard to miss the liberating effect of women driving might have in many other areas. It could challenge pretty much every concept of women's place in society, so while it may not have been the No. 1 issue for some women it really could be a game changer. Right now, women can't even work in the same room as men, they need a male relative's permission to leave the house and they need that relative at their side if they meet an unrelated male. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Yet in Riyadh and Jeddah and other cities these rules are bent every day. The hunger for change, particularly among the young, is huge and growing. The Crown Prince has read that sentiment well, but implementing it will be a double-edged sword for him. Setting limits and managing expectations will be Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's challenge. He has already had to dial back delivery on his 2030 Vision, the plan for economic reform he laid out last year. It was widely viewed by some Saudis and many outsiders as ambitious and fast-paced. Another Saudi video from last weekend showed the high-speed antics of male teenagers hanging out of car windows racing through city traffic, all revved up on the intoxicating sense of freedom induced by just one night of revelry. When it comes to driving, perhaps women might display a welcome lack of testosterone. Through all the changes to come, that might be no bad thing.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "king salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed bin salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed bin salman yet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeddah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "desert kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riyadh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T20:29:45.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ccb59cbc5f472041f15c12147a3a3dcd5583787", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKfjRbXPeaBjOTiOxPB1lFvezMjO8GFyWVfu8VogIxy_cgYh64NC4gnR60rdInHTliy.HwukfKWbg", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Steve Bannon plots way to keep momentum after Alabama win - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Steve Bannon plots way to keep momentum after Alabama win - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926122447-steve-bannon-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 345, "comments": 0, "shares": 345}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6ccb59cbc5f472041f15c12147a3a3dcd5583787", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKfjRbXPeaBjOTiOxPB1lFvezMjO8GFyWVfu8VogIxy_cgYh64NC4gnR60rdInHTliy.HwukfKWbg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dana Bash", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Steve Bannon plots way to keep momentum after Alabama win - CNNPolitics", "text": "Story highlights Bannon has vowed to take on the GOP establishment in coming primaries He was on the winning side Tuesday night, and a source said he was looking all over the map to keep that momentum Washington (CNN) Fresh off a win in Alabama, Breitbart chief Steve Bannon is taking action to keep up his role in a coming Republican divide.\nA source familiar with the recently fired top White House aide to President Donald Trump said Bannon was working with Roy Moore's team as the far-right former judge moves on from Tuesday's primary toward the December 12 special election.

He takes that very seriously and has taken it to heart,\" HHS press secretary Caitlin Oakley said in a statement. \"The IG is going through a review and an audit of this process which we fully support.\" Oakley also said Price \"has initiated an internal departmental review of the procedures and processes that we go through for official travel to determine whether there are any changes or reforms that are necessary,\" and added that Price remains focused on his job. \"At the same time, the secretary and the department continues to work day and night to protect and enhance the health and well-being of the American people -- for example, providing assistance and medical care to Americans affected by the recent hurricanes and partnering with state and local community leaders to combat the opioid epidemic in America,\" Oakley said. The issue came to the forefront after reports revealed that several of the President's Cabinet secretaries, notably Price, chartered private planes on the federal dime. HHS Secretary Price: No business trips on private planes while matter is reviewed The Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general is investigating Price's decision to opt for private charter planes instead of commercially available means of travel. Politico first reported Price's use of charter jets for official business earlier this month, and followed that article with another that said the secretary has traveled on charter flights at least 24 times since May , citing people familiar with his travel plans and a review of HHS documents. Charter plane operators estimated 24 flights would have cost $300,000, Politico reported. Commercial trips would have cost thousands of dollars less. Asked Wednesday whether he has confidence in Price, Trump declined to offer a clear answer, saying only that he is \"looking into it.\" And would he fire Price? \"We'll see,\" Trump offered. The President's blunt words underscored his strong displeasure toward Price that could ultimately lead to his dismissal. Yet one administration official noted that Trump has also been furious at Attorney General Jeff Sessions and several other top advisers who he has not fired. 'Not good optics' JUST WATCHED Before private flights, Price criticized them Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nBefore private flights, Price criticized them 00:48 Earlier Wednesday, a top White House official said the administration was awaiting the internal and congressional inquiry into Price's use of private jets but declined to say whether the President had confidence in the secretary. \"I'm not going to comment on that because the President hasn't commented publicly,\" Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House adviser, told reporters. Another White House official said the repeated reports of private jet use by Price were \"not good optics,\" but said the President was focused on the Alabama Senate race and his tax speech Wednesday and had not talked extensively to aides about Price. Inside the department, the mood is souring. According to a former Obama administration official who is in close touch multiple Health and Human Services officials in the building, there has been growing frustration with each new report of Price's private charter plane use. In particular, career officials are \"aghast\" and one person said they were \"livid,\" according to the former Obama administration official. Two current officials this source spoke to simply could not \"believe he was using taxpayer money for a private plane.\" Hill reaction Government watchdog looking into Price's use of charter jets On Capitol Hill, the House Oversight Committee released a letter Wednesday revealing it was also investigating the use of private aircraft for official administration business. In a letter addressed to Price, both the committee's top Republican, Rep. Trey Gowdy, and Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings, said they were \"examining the extent to which non-career officials at federal departments and agencies either use government-owned aircraft for personal travel or private non-commercial aircraft for official travel.\" The committee is looking at all Cabinet member travel, not just Price's. Republicans on Capitol Hill have been slow to admonish Price, a former colleague, saying instead they are still trying to understand exactly what occurred. One Senior Republican aide, speaking before Trump's latest remarks, pushed back on the idea that Price would face any serious consequences for his use of private planes saying unless an email revealed Price asked deliberately not to fly \"with the masses,\" the controversy would be a few days story. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman Homeland Security Committee said he wanted to \"wait for the information\" from the HHS inspector general before commenting. Asked if he has confidence in Price, Johnson went to speak, then stopped himself and walked away. Democrats, meanwhile, are more forthcoming with their outrage. Price, after all, maintained a reputation on Capitol Hill of being a fiscal hardliner and constant voice admonishing wasteful government spending. \"I'd like to introduce Secretary Price to the train,\" Sen. Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat, quipped. \"Not everybody can lease a plane like that and fly around the country. And I think as a public servant, you have to try to set some sort of example. \"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom price", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnnpolitics story", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "human servi", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cabinet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "health and human services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of health and human services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T20:29:51.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8a3f592a427d3060b8dfb299641866fa2836f86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKaieG5E9zolXp1r9imp6HFVerPyhma5teEthh91MQOQfk0zbX0O6U2g-", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "What this GOP senator's retirement reveals about Trump's Washington - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "What this GOP senator's retirement reveals about Trump's Washington - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170629142853-sen-bob-corker-april-25-2017-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 48, "comments": 0, "shares": 48}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f8a3f592a427d3060b8dfb299641866fa2836f86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKaieG5E9zolXp1r9imp6HFVerPyhma5teEthh91MQOQfk0zbX0O6U2g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Analysis by Chris Cillizza", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "What this GOP senator's retirement reveals about Trump's Washington - CNNPolitics", "text": "Story highlights Sen. Bob Corker said Tuesday he'd retire after his term wraps next year His cited reasons for stepping down are odd by the traditional D.C. standards Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has turned Washington upside down. \nIn ways big and small, with implications tiny and vast, the campaign that delivered Trump the White House -- and the way he has acted since arriving in Washington eight months ago -- has totally upended conventional wisdom about what politicians say and do. The latest example is the decision Tuesday by Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican, to retire after two terms . In his announcement, Corker cited his commitment to being a citizen legislator as the driving force behind his decision. \"When I ran for the Senate in 2006, I told people that I couldn't imagine serving for more than two term,\" he said. \"Understandably, as we have gained influence, that decision has become more difficult. But I have always been drawn to the citizen legislator model, and while I realize it is not for everyone, I believe with the kind of service I provide, it is the right one for me.\" Read More Which is fine! But also odd by the traditional standards of Washington. After all, the term limits movement long ago lost any of the perceived power it had to call out members who broke their pledges to serve some sort of set time in Washington. More importantly, Republicans are not only in the majority in the Senate through 2018 but, given the map next November, could well add a few seats to that majority heading into the next Congress. Corker still had two years -- after 2018 -- left on his term as chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee. And, if Republicans held onto their majority in 2020, he would have been the chairman of the influential banking committee and a powerful player on the budget committee as well. In the old days, NO member of the majority party with as many prominent committee seats as Corker would have even considered retiring. It just wasn't done. Plus, Corker was an ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and someone who -- until recently -- enjoyed a relatively friendly relationship with the Trump White House. Corker was considered as a vice presidential nominee in 2016 and mentioned for a slot as secretary of state in Trump's Cabinet. And, at 65, Corker is positively a spring chicken in the Senate. Against all of those positives, Corker's explanation that he simply wanted to stay true to his roots as a citizen legislator rings hollow. Or, more accurately, it rings incomplete. The simple fact is that life in Trump's Washington -- and Trump's Republican Party -- is just no fun for a guy like Corker. While he's a conservative, he's no ideologue. He developed a reputation as a dealmaker shortly after coming to Washington and has worked to maintain that rep in his 11 years in the chamber. Of Corker, The Tennessean wrote in 2013 : \"The Tennessee Republican has been a point man on banking reform, with President Barack Obama endorsing the proposal he developed with Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. His amendment to increase spending on security along the US-Mexican border helped win passage in the Senate of an immigration bill that is loathed deeply by tea party activists.\" That profile has become increasingly unattractive to Republican primary voters. Corker faced the likelihood of a challenge next year form his ideological right -- spurred on by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. He would have started as the favorite in that race but a win was far from certain. Then there is the more-difficult-to-quantify stress and strain of being a pragmatic and policy-focused Republican in Trump's Washington. For Corker, who thinks big policy thoughts and wants to find ways to make government work, Trump's unpredictability and yo-yoing moods -- as expressed via tweet -- had to be frustrating. He let that frustration slip last month while talking to reporters in Tennessee. \"The President has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful,\" said Corker . \"We should hope that (Trump) aspires that he does some self-reflection, that he does what is necessary to demonstrate stability, to demonstrate competence, to demonstrate that he understands the character of our nation and works daily to bring out the best of the people in our nation.\" Trump -- natch! -- attacked Corker on Twitter for those comments. \"Strange statement by Bob Corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in '18,\" tweeted Trump . \"Tennessee not happy!\" The prospect of six more years of answering questions from reporters day in and day out that began \"Did you see Trump's tweet ...\" was surely not one that Corker relished. Corker follows a series of other pragmatic Republicans out the door in 2018 including Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, (Florida), Charlie Dent (Pennsylvania) and Dave Reichert (Washington). The conclusion? The \"governing wing\" of the Republican Party -- as Dent put it -- isn't having any fun in Washington anymore.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob corker", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ileana ros-lehtinen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave reichert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark warner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie dent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fannie mae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump's cabinet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freddie mac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump's republican party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump the white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T20:29:57.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6327ce4281cea277988a1e40ff62e458e1dfed26", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7W2Gy8W1WeaRfH4Tfptc30invfWjXlCzJpbkUZ7cJSI25mK0I7tpUSDhg9O3dzL5xYHGjaF0w769", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - HP Hero", "title": "CIA's 'Batman' and son spied for Russia", "title_full": "CIA's 'Batman' and son spied for Russia", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/09/21/socialcard2.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 234, "comments": 0, "shares": 234}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 6}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6327ce4281cea277988a1e40ff62e458e1dfed26", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7W2Gy8W1WeaRfH4Tfptc30invfWjXlCzJpbkUZ7cJSI25mK0I7tpUSDhg9O3dzL5xYHGjaF0w769", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "CIA's 'Batman' and son spied for Russia", "text": "How a CIA traitor turned his son into a Russian spy By Drew Kann Surrounded by FBI agents and US marshals, Bryan Denson\u2019s first encounter with an ex-CIA spy nicknamed \u201cBatman\u201d came in 2009 in a Portland, Oregon, courtroom. But as Jim Nicholson faced the judge, Denson noticed the ex-spy\u2019s expression bore little of the hero-like confidence that earned him his nickname during his 26 years serving the US government. Denson says in 1997, Nicholson became the highest-ranking CIA officer ever convicted of espionage, after selling the identities of hundreds of CIA trainees and troves of highly classified files to Russia\u2019s foreign spy service. On this January day, though, Nicholson entered court to answer new charges: that he had not only reconnected with the Russians from inside prison, but had enlisted his son, Nathan Nicholson, to serve as his intermediary. Nathan Nicholson visited his father, Jim Nicholson, in prison around Christmas 2003. Both father and son pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges. Nathan avoided prison, but was sentenced to five years of probation and 100 hours of community service. Meanwhile, Jim received an eight-year sentence to be served consecutively with the 23 years he was already serving for his previous crimes. Denson, an investigative journalist, spent the next seven years covering the case for The Oregonian newspaper and then later for his book about the father-son spy duo, The Spy\u2019s Son . \"\u2026I still say that what drove his desire for money was his extraordinary ego.\" What he discovered was a heartbreaking story of daring espionage, a son\u2019s undying devotion to his father, and the devastating consequences when that trust is betrayed. CNN spoke to Denson about the unique saga of Jim and Nathan Nicholson. The interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Read more about the spy-versus-spy operation that led to Jim Nicholson's first arrest. CNN: What do you think really motivated Jim Nicholson to commit these acts of betrayal? Was it greed and hubris, or something more sinister? Bryan Denson: Jim's desire for money was a big part of it, but I still say that what drove his desire for money was his extraordinary ego. I think that Jim wanted the money, but more than that, he wanted to get that money to people who would then love him for that \u2014 his kids, primarily, and to some extent his \"fianc\u00e9,\" who he was sending money to as well. In an undated photo taken at a CIA function, Jim Nicholson's shirt is rich in irony in light of his crimes. CNN: In the book, Jim's colleagues describe him as a formidable spy, but he made some mistakes that helped the FBI build its case against him. Do you think Nicholson was given too much credit for his smarts or did other factors \u2014 like his ego \u2014 play a part in his less than-intelligent decisions? Bryan Denson: Jim made some bad decisions. ... The one that immediately comes to mind is him stepping into a car with (Russian) diplomatic plates on it in Singapore when he was under surveillance. Jim carrying the business card of his Swiss banker in his wallet at the time he was about to fly overseas to Switzerland was almost laughable. But the truth is, there's no perfect way to betray your country or to move around the world without having problems. \"Nathan was the most like Jim and would have done anything to please his dad. And Jim knew that.\u201d CNN: Jim has three children but chose his youngest -- Nathan -- to continue spying for Russia after he went to prison. Why do you think he chose him? Bryan Denson: Nathan was the most like Jim and would have done anything to please his dad. And Jim knew that. He used that vulnerability and the fact that Nathan was despondent over having washed out of the army with a back injury. He used both of those vulnerabilities to his advantage. CNN: One of the scenes that stood out to me in the book is the scene where Nathan is sitting on his bed and injuries have just derailed his military career and he's contemplating suicide. Then the phone rings and it's his dad calling from prison, and he unintentionally talks Nathan down from going through with it. How do you think that influenced Nathan's decision to execute Jim's plan to reconnect with the Russians? Bryan Denson: I don't think there's any question that he felt that his father reaching him on the phone was something straight from the divine. I think the attempted suicide and Jim's accidental intervention were pivotal. It marked a point where Nathan clearly saw his dad as a kind of protector, and Nathan clearly wanted to get closer to his dad after he returned to Oregon. I think that issue and Jim's slow grooming of Nathan made him the perfect victim of Jim's manipulation. Nathan Nicholson avoided a prison sentence in 2010 for his role as his father's liaison with the Russians. CNN: Throughout the book, you talk about all the steps Jim took to hide Nathan from the danger he was in by working for the Russians. How much do you think Nathan actually understood about the trouble he was getting himself into? Bryan Denson: I don't think Nathan ever fully understood that he was committing felony crimes when working as his dad's agent. The truth is Nathan never knew until well after his arrest what Jim was really doing. \"\u2026 he felt that his father reaching him on the phone was something straight from the divine.\u201d And it was long after that in our conversations, when I was pointing out what the Russians were looking for, when Nathan finally cottoned to the whole idea that he was doing something that was really, really wrong \u2014 he was helping the Russian federation, and he was serving as an agent of the Russian federation, rather than as his dad's agent. CNN: In light of all that's happened between them, how does Nathan feel today about the nature of his relationship with his dad? Bryan Denson: Nathan still has a number of questions that he will one day ask his father ... not the least of which is, how on earth could you have done this? How could you have not shared with me the dangers? Because I'm pretty convinced, knowing Nathan very, very well now, that Nathan would have turned his dad down if he'd understood that his dad was asking him to commit a felony. The other question that Nathan will ask him is: After everything that happened, was it worth it to anybody? \"It's the primary source of sadness in his life.\u201d CNN: They are not allowed to communicate, correct? But does he even want to speak with his father? Bryan Denson: They are not allowed to communicate at all. My sense from Nathan is that he's resigned to the fact that he will not be able to talk to his dad until 2024, when his dad gets out of prison. But it certainly weighs on him. It's the primary source of sadness in his life. Inside the spy-versus-spy operation that took down a CIA turncoat By Bryan Denson In the annals of American espionage, Jim Nicholson holds four superlatives. He\u2019s the highest-ranking CIA officer convicted of selling America\u2019s secrets to a foreign nation. He\u2019s the only US intelligence officer convicted twice of betraying his country. And he\u2019s the only one to have pulled it off from behind prison bars. But Nicholson\u2019s fourth dishonorable distinction offers the most drama: He\u2019s the only CIA officer ever nabbed in a literal spy-versus-spy operation inside the agency\u2019s headquarters at Langley, Virginia. He was targeted by a brother officer in a daring undercover investigation. John Maguire was enlisted to spy on fellow CIA officer Jim Nicholson as part of the joint CIA-FBI counterespionage investigation that put Nicholson behind bars. John Maguire became the ultimate \"inside man\" in a case that shows how far counterespionage investigators will go to catch a mole in their midst. The story of Maguire's top-secret operation (told for the first time in my book \"The Spy's Son\"), provides a rare portal into the persistent spy wars between Moscow and Washington. Maguire's assignment came during a rough patch in his career. He had been \"sent home\" -- agency lingo for being taken out of the field \u2014 after getting crossways with his boss. Maguire was exiled to the worst imaginable position for a highly skilled case officer: a desk job in human resources. But in 1996, he was given a chance to redeem himself as part of a joint CIA-FBI counterespionage operation. That\u2019s where Maguire comes in. We Have Another Aldrich Ames Langley, Virginia, summer 1996 John Maguire sat in a cubicle village on the second floor of CIA headquarters, a clean, well-carpeted place full of file cabinets and misery. After fourteen years of exciting spy work, he now labored in utter obscurity in a pool of human resources mopes. Maguire had spent most of his years in the agency on the front lines of the Cold War, although more recently he labored as a counterterrorism operative in the Middle East. He had served in such garden spots as El Salvador, Honduras, Lebanon, and Iraq. But now it was abundantly clear that at forty-two, his once-promising career in espionage was over. After fourteen years of exciting spy work, he now labored in utter obscurity in a pool of human resources mopes. Maguire had gotten crossways with his boss, the Near East Division chief, for refusing to take an overseas posting in Karachi, Pakistan. His penance was a position in HR, in the bowels of the CIA\u2019s Original Headquarters Building, part of the agency\u2019s sprawling, highly secured compound in the Langley community of McLean, Virginia. There he drank sweetened coffee and pushed pencils amid the agency\u2019s plebes, poring through the personnel files of other CIA officers to determine those worthy of promotions. He found it disheartening to labor through the applications of agency employees who, unlike himself, might actually be promoted. Maguire\u2019s ennui was broken, from time to time, by the prank calls of colleagues still performing actual spy work. Some disguised their voices to ask about their promotions packets before busting a gut. Others phoned to make such helpful declarations as, \u201cYou\u2019re so f***ed.\u201d One day, in the spring of 1996, Maguire\u2019s phone rang and he heard the voice of Anna, the secretary of the Near East Division. Anna was a powerful figure in the division, something of an aging Miss Moneypenny, and as part of the senior secretarial pool, she enjoyed the oblique horsepower of her division chief. When Anna called, you paid attention. When you needed help, she was your oracle. Need to proof-check an official memo? She pored over it, caught your errors. Need to reach an overseas leader, a business figure, someone at the White House? She had the number. Screw up badly? She dressed you down, leaving you standing with your shoes smoking as if you\u2019d been struck by lightning. Anna was a striking, statuesque woman with raven hair. All the senior secretaries in the CIA had juice. If they liked you, they could make your life easier. Anna seemed to like Maguire. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d she asked. Jim Nicholson's 1996 arrest on the tarmac at Dulles International Airport near Washington. I\u2019m trying not to kill myself in my seat,\u201d he said. \u201cCome upstairs,\u201d he heard her say. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody where you\u2019re going. Just leave your desk and come up here to me right now.\u201d \u201cOK.\u201d Like so many times in his career, Maguire could only imagine the fresh patch of hell in front of him. He had served seven years as a cop in his native Baltimore, then fourteen more as a spy. He understood the swift, decisive nature of upper-management bureaucrats, whose sudden decrees often fell into subordinates\u2019 laps like hot coals. Maguire hauled his six-foot-three, 195-pound frame out of his chair and slipped away quietly. He caught an elevator to the sixth floor, one level below the penthouse of power, where the Director of Central Intelligence runs the show. There, outside his boss\u2019s door, he found Anna at her desk. She steered him into the office, and the door closed. He stood in front of a familiar wooden desk, behind which sat Steve Richter, whom he had never seen without a suit and tie. Richter, a key part of the Directorate of Operations, the CIA\u2019s clandestine wing, oversaw spy operations across the Middle East. Maguire thought his boss was one of the smartest and most talented of the agency\u2019s senior intelligence officers, and also one of the most vindictive. The previous fall, Richter had flown to London to tell Maguire of his next assignment: Karachi. The move would have taken Maguire out of his work in northern Iraq, and he wanted none of it. He had run spy and paramilitary operations in the Middle East nation for five years, having first dropped into Iraq for the Persian Gulf War. Maguire felt invested in Iraq\u2019s future. It had taken years to wrap his head around the country\u2019s complicated, tribally based culture, its Ba\u2019ath Party leadership, and the wickedness of Saddam Hussein and his power-sick sons, Uday and Qusay. He had hoped that his good work would be rewarded with a promotion to a leadership post in Amman or Abu Dhabi. \u201cI have an assignment for you,\u201d Richter said.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything about it.\u201d Maguire asked Richter to let him stay on in London. He was happy there, enjoying what is known in Foreign Service parlance as an \u201caccompanied tour\u201d with his wife and two daughters. Maguire told Richter he hoped to continue his vital work in Iraq, where he had developed locals -- sometimes with trunks of cash -- to gain secrets from inside Iraq\u2019s seats of power. Richter hadn\u2019t flown to London to negotiate. He urged Maguire to take the assignment and report to the CIA station in Karachi. That\u2019s when Maguire played his last card. He told Richter that his wife, a registered nurse, had long told him there were only two countries on the planet so full of filth and disease that she refused to raise their girls in them: India and Pakistan. For those reasons, Maguire told his boss, he would have to politely decline the job in Karachi. Richter wasn\u2019t accustomed to being told no. He left Maguire in stony silence. Soon after, Maguire got the cable letting him know he was being called back to Langley to work in human resources, his requests for posts in the Middle East denied. Now he found himself standing in front of Richter\u2019s desk. Maguire\u2019s boss, not known for warm and fuzzy moments with subordinates, didn\u2019t invite him to take a seat. It would be a short meeting. \u201cI have an assignment for you,\u201d Richter said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything about it.\u201d He told Maguire that he needed an answer then and there, and that a yes would be good for his career. If he said no, all he had to do was go back downstairs and never utter a word about the conversation. \u201cYou have to give me an answer now,\u201d Richter said. Maguire, flummoxed, glanced to his right. A stranger sat on the couch. The man wore a nice suit and a blue badge denoting him as a CIA staffer. Maguire figured he was a senior agency man. He planted his eyes on Richter\u2019s face to read his reaction to his next words. \u201cCan I ask a question or two?\u201d Richter peered at Maguire sourly. \u201cYou can ask,\u201d he said. Maguire turned to the man on the couch. \u201cWho\u2019s this guy?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Ed Curran,\u201d the stranger said. \u201cI\u2019m the highest-ranking FBI agent assigned inside the CIA.\u201d F**k me, Maguire thought. His mind flew back to Iraq and the troubles there. The FBI was still investigating the CIA\u2019s role in organizing an unsuccessful coup that March against Saddam Hussein by his own military. Maguire and his team had rotated into northern Iraq during that covert action (code-named DBACHILLES), which failed. Saddam executed at least eighty of his officers involved in the attempted overthrow. \u201cF*** it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take it. Whatever it is, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Maguire feared that the new \u201cassignment\u201d Richter was offering might be a ham-handed setup for questioning by the FBI. The appearance of Curran only deepened his anxiety. Maguire\u2019s choices seemed clear. He could turn down a potentially choice assignment, whatever it was, and retreat to the cubicle dungeon and the slow immolation of his soul. Or he could do as the paratroopers say in that instant before leaping out of airplanes: Pull the cord, trust the Lord. \u201cF**k it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take it. Whatever it is, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d \u201cWise choice,\u201d Richter said. Maguire could sense by the tone of his boss\u2019s voice that the meeting was over. Curran, no doubt amused by the exchange, gave Maguire orders: Go downstairs to the lobby. Do not talk to anyone, and tell no one where you\u2019ve been. You\u2019ll meet a couple of FBI agents at the front door, who will give you instructions. Maguire nodded along. \u201cOK,\u201d he said. Outside Richter\u2019s office, he shot a glance at Anna. She winked. Moments later, Maguire walked off an elevator on the first floor, turned a corner, and trudged down a half-dozen steps, where he badged through the security turnstiles. He walked past the statue of William J. \u201cWild Bill\u201d Donovan, a figure who stood literally and figuratively on a pedestal in the agency. Donovan had created the Office of Strategic Services, forerunner to the CIA, which helped win World War II. Maguire stepped across the agency\u2019s iconic lobby, with its massive seal -- the head of an eagle atop a sixteen-point compass -- laid into cold granite. There he found two men standing in business suits. They flashed their credentials and asked Maguire to follow them. All moved for the front doors. Maguire found himself seated in the rear of a plain-Jane bureau car, which rolled out of the Langley compound into the northern Virginia suburbs. The ride was a blur of bright green tree canopies, the engine\u2019s drone, and a pair of FBI agents attempting to break the tension with small talk. Maguire heard one of them ask him, \u201cWhattaya think?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m not used to riding in the back of a police car. It doesn\u2019t fill me with confidence. But I\u2019m not cuffed yet.\u201d The agents told him to relax. But Maguire, who had served on some of America\u2019s most dangerous streets in Baltimore, didn\u2019t feel fine. When he was a cop, he\u2019d been the one putting perps in squad cars for the free rides to jail. Soon the car pulled up to a house deep in the suburbs, in a neighborhood Maguire didn\u2019t recognize. The FBI agents led him inside, where he spied a few others. Only then did he fully understand where he\u2019d been taken. He was in a bureau safe house. Agents brought him to a bedroom, where he found an older man sitting behind a desk. The man hooked him up to a polygraph with a confidence that only contributed to Maguire\u2019s unease. \u201cWe have another Ames, and we have to catch him.\u201d Maguire was accustomed to routine lie-detector tests. The agency wired its clandestine officers to the box every few years, usually when they rotated through headquarters, for single-issue polygraphs. Tests on the box were supposed to help the agency detect turncoats in their midst. But rarely, if ever, did they do anything of the kind. Polygraph operators place their subjects on a pad that can sense the clenching of their sphincters, a device known by those who\u2019ve sat on them as the \u201cwhoopee cushion.\u201d Maguire took his seat, his sphincter already tight enough to crush walnuts. There the older agent connected him to a series of wires that measured his breathing, blood pressure, pulse, and perspiration. Polygraphers always begin with slam-dunk queries -- \u201cIs your name John R. Maguire?\u201d -- before asking the subject to respond with a deliberate lie or two. These are called control questions. For instance, the operator might tell a subject to deliberately lie to a question such as, \u201cHave you ever stolen anything?\u201d Few humans can honestly answer that with a no. When the respondent lies, the polygraph\u2019s stylus jiggles, giving the operator a benchmark for later deceptive answers. Relevant questions follow. Maguire dreaded the first such query, which he imagined would go something like this: \u201cDid you, or did you not, authorize or participate in an attempt to overthrow the regime in Iraq?\u201d He tried to think ahead. He knew he hadn\u2019t done anything illegal; the actions of CIA officers in the field assigned to wresting Saddam Hussein from power were fully authorized by senior agency officials like Richter. The White House was distancing itself, but officials in the Clinton administration had been briefed directly. Maguire decided that if the agent running the box posed even one question about Iraq, he\u2019d politely ask to speak with his lawyer. The genteel polygraph operator, perhaps sensing Maguire\u2019s inner tumult, told him to relax, everything was going to be OK. And sure enough, when the older man eventually got around to asking the moment-of-truth questions, they were all about Russia and Russian intelligence. Maguire breathed easier. He had no operational history with the Russians, and if Moscow\u2019s foreign intelligence officers had anything on him, it would have been thin, dated, and focused on his paramilitary past. As far as he knew, he\u2019d never been a target of the KGB or the SVR. The polygraph took about ninety minutes, and when the operator told him he\u2019d passed, one of the FBI agents led Maguire into another room in the house, which clearly served as a hub for an investigation of some kind. They seated him at a desk, where he signed formal papers by which he swore not to divulge any of the classified information he was about to hear. The agents told him they were from Squad NS-34, a counterintelligence unit based in the Washington Metropolitan Field Office. They occupied a dilapidated building at the confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers, a gritty corner of DC known as Buzzard Point. Maguire spied a photograph of a bearded man on the wall. It appeared to be an official CIA photo. He didn\u2019t recognize the face. Jim Nicholson is the only CIA officer to be nabbed twice betraying his country, and the only one ever caught in a spy-versus-spy operation inside the agency's headquarters. \u201cYou\u2019ve been selected for this position,\u201d one of the agents told Maguire. \u201cWe have another Ames, and we have to catch him.\u201d The FBI and CIA had handpicked Maguire to help catch this new mole. His background as a cop, and his experience testifying in court, made him a shoo-in as a candidate to help the bureau gather evidence inside CIA headquarters and neuter their suspect: Harold James \u201cJim\u201d Nicholson. Agents explained that Jim, whom Maguire had never met, was now in his sixteenth year as a CIA operations officer. He taught tradecraft at The Farm, a plum job given to spies who\u2019d proven themselves in the field. Jim, he learned, was a single dad with primary custody of his three kids: Son Jeremi was headed to college; daughter Star and younger son Nathan lived in a two-story government house at Camp Peary, but were soon moving to the family town house in Burke, Virginia. Maguire knew The Farm well. He had taken his five-month career trainee course and extensive paramilitary training on its grounds before being sent to a CIA demolition school in a covert redoubt in the mid- Atlantic tidewaters. There, he had learned how to build and dismantle all manner of explosives. The agents had cooked up a scheme for senior CIA officials to call Jim back from The Farm and assign him as a branch chief in the Counter- terrorist Center, or CTC, in the Original Headquarters Building. (It was later renamed the Counterterrorism Center.) Maguire would apply to work as the deputy branch chief under Jim. FBI investigators hoped Jim would pick Maguire over other applicants for the position. If all went according to plan, Maguire would take the office next to Jim\u2019s. The FBI- CIA team would covertly supervise Maguire\u2019s undercover tilt against his own boss, a spy-versus-spy operation in the bosom of CIA headquarters. No such investigation had ever been run under the roof at Langley. Investigators knew Jim would interview several experienced CIA officers for the position of deputy branch chief, his top subordinate. But they secretly stacked the deck with Maguire, who had much stronger credentials than the others. Maguire was a founding member of the CTC, a distinction marking him as a \u201cplank holder.\u201d He knew the territory, having worked against Middle East terrorists for years. Maguire was a good spy, and the kind of guy you\u2019d join for a few rounds of bourbon. But investigators looking to bring Jim to justice were more interested in the skills Maguire had acquired in his former life as a Baltimore City cop. He had worked long hours in the violent corners of Charm City\u2019s neighborhoods, streets later made famous in The Wire. Maguire worked well with prosecutors and logged countless hours on witness stands. If all went according to plan, Maguire would take the office next to Jim\u2019s. He walked into Room 6E2911 that summer for his interview with Jim. They took seats in Jim\u2019s office, which sat behind a heavy cipher- locked door on the far end of a bullpen of case officers and career trainees. Much was revealed to Maguire when he sneaked a glance at the I-love-me walls flanking his prospective boss\u2019s desk. Everywhere he looked there were framed photos of Jim, certificates, military awards, and other commendations. It was clear the guy was smart, and liked himself. A lot. \u201cHe was a good interviewer,\u201d Maguire recalled. \u201cHe was looking for somebody who knew what they were doing, understood the target, somebody he could rely on\u2014somebody he could use.\u201d Maguire recited his bona fides to Jim, explaining that he was an experienced hand, good at cultivating assets, and was happy to put some of his best Middle East contacts back on the payroll. He said his assets could help Jim\u2019s branch identify and break up cells of Islamic fundamentalists bent on killing Americans or otherwise threatening U.S. security. Jim wondered how a talented case officer had fallen so far, ending up in HR. So Maguire leveled with him. He\u2019d pissed off Richter, who had cast him into the abyss. Maguire joked about wanting to jump out the window, but HR was on the second floor and he\u2019d only break a bunch of bones. The two veteran spies shared a laugh. Jim knew Richter, and he\u2019d certainly faced his own hassles with agency bureaucracy. But although he appreciated Maguire\u2019s dire predicament, he couldn\u2019t promise him anything. Maguire walked out thinking he\u2019d nailed the interview. But he knew Jim wasn\u2019t about to hire him until he\u2019d worked the hallway file: the informal vetting of prospective employees in the corridors, back offices, and massive food court on the first floor of the agency\u2019s Original Headquarters Building. There were plenty of people inside who would vouch for Maguire\u2019s native talent as a spy, and a couple who could f**k things up with a mixed review. Investigators crossed their fingers. Without somebody working for them inside Jim\u2019s locked office, there was no telling how many of the nation\u2019s most closely guarded secrets Jim would purloin and sell to the Russians during daylight duties in the CTC. This was his passport out of the Death Star, and a chance to try his spy skills against one of the shrewdest characters he\u2019d ever met. Weeks later, Maguire picked up an envelope addressed to him at work. Inside was a directive from the personnel division. The CIA bureaucracy was so big that if you moved from one part of the agency to another, even laterally, someone had to create paperwork to update your salary and benefits. The papers told Maguire to report immediately as deputy branch chief in the CTC under Jim Nicholson. This was his passport out of the Death Star, and a chance to try his spy skills against one of the shrewdest characters he\u2019d ever met. Not long after Maguire got word he would be working for Jim, Redmond called him for a meeting in one of the agency\u2019s \u201cblack rooms,\u201d offices with no descriptors on the door, just cipher locks. There he found himself buttonholed by the veteran counterintelligence supervisor who had headed the long-in-coming apprehension of Rick Ames. Redmond confided in Maguire that if he performed well in his undercover role, he\u2019d serve his country admirably and notch a major milestone in his career. \u201cIf you f**k it up,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re finished.

It showed young men and women, together in the same street , dancing to a live DJ's beat, fluorescent lights strobing as they pulsed up and down. This place is right around the corner from Riyadh's infamous \"Chop Chop\" square where criminals are routinely executed by sword. It's a pretty sensitive location. You just don't see Saudi kids doing that outdoors anywhere and getting away with it, let alone there. Religious police would round them up in no time. Admittedly, the dancing was on the heels of Saudi National Day when spirits typically run high, but never has the Saudi leadership let its leash on public restraint run so loose. Read More Women in Saudi Arabia still can't do these things This is a country built on conservative teachings, grown out of a desert culture so harsh that when loved ones die, their graves are left unmarked. Still, when I read the announcement that Saudi women were to be given the right to drive , part of me was not too surprised. It fits the recent mood music around Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's 2030 vision for change in the Kingdom. The Crown Prince wants to bring more women into the workplace, in an effort to diversify and boost the economy -- allowing women to drive is a way of accelerating that vision. The decision also comes at a time when Saudi Arabia is under increasing international scrutiny, not just because of the civilian toll from its war in Yemen, but also as a result of tensions with Iran, a sudden rift with former Gulf ally Qatar, even bin Salman's promotion over the head of his uncle to be next in line to replace his father, King Salman. Regardless of why, the change has been building behind the scenes for a while now -- ministers and teams replaced, other more subtle shakeups -- but it was never quite clear where it was leading. It's still not clear. We'll have to see how the decision to let women drive is put in place before we can draw firm conclusions. Women's rights Of all the subjects that I've covered in reporting on Saudi Arabia down the years, the one I've spent most time on is women's rights: from female campaigners behind the wheel, to bloggers, to upper-class activists who bend the King's ear to push for change, to young aspirational women in school and out on their first job beholden to their father's whim on the limits of their travel and achievement. For many of these women, driving is not the biggest issue . Far more important are basic rights to equal a man's, like the right not to need a male guardian's permission to set foot out of the house. One thing that came up time and again from men and some women was the question, what does a woman do when her car breaks down? Of course, this starts from the misogynist's view that a woman won't be able to change a tire or fix a faulty headlamp at the roadside. A Saudi woman prepares to get into a taxi on a main street in the Saudi coastal city of Jeddah on September 27, 2017. But the answer most gave runs like this: If she is alone in the car, how can she ask for help unless her guardian, a male family member, is with her? Talking to a male outside her family it could bring dishonor, even violent retribution. The subtext is that women out alone might not be safe, subject not to the laws of the land but to the capricious mores of a conservative, tribal society. When you consider driving in that context it's hard to miss the liberating effect of women driving might have in many other areas. It could challenge pretty much every concept of women's place in society, so while it may not have been the No. 1 issue for some women it really could be a game changer. Right now, women can't even work in the same room as men, they need a male relative's permission to leave the house and they need that relative at their side if they meet an unrelated male. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Yet in Riyadh and Jeddah and other cities these rules are bent every day. The hunger for change, particularly among the young, is huge and growing. The Crown Prince has read that sentiment well, but implementing it will be a double-edged sword for him. Setting limits and managing expectations will be Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's challenge. He has already had to dial back delivery on his 2030 Vision, the plan for economic reform he laid out last year. It was widely viewed by some Saudis and many outsiders as ambitious and fast-paced. Another Saudi video from last weekend showed the high-speed antics of male teenagers hanging out of car windows racing through city traffic, all revved up on the intoxicating sense of freedom induced by just one night of revelry.

A source familiar with the recently fired top White House aide to President Donald Trump said Bannon was working with Roy Moore's team as the far-right former judge moves on from Tuesday's primary toward the December 12 special election. The source said Bannon was likewise meeting with and talking to candidate teams in Tennessee and Mississippi. GOP Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker announced Tuesday he would not seek re-election, a blow to Republican leadership hours before Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's preferred candidate, Sen. Luther Strange, lost the primary runoff in Alabama. Read More Bannon was also looking to get involved with candidates from the West, with the source telling CNN that he was flying to Colorado to recruit. The source also said Bannon planned to speak at the Council on National Policy conference, a gathering of social conservative grassroots leaders about the ground game needed to \"defeat elites\" in coming races. The moves would show Bannon still intends to follow through on his claim earlier this month that he would be a \"wingman\" for Trump against the GOP establishment and would get involved in GOP races. Bannon left the White House in early August as part of a lengthy shakeup of Trump's team over the summer. Almost immediately upon departing, Bannon retook the helm of Breitbart, a news site strongly supportive of Trump and opposed not only to Democrats but Republican leadership figures like McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan. At the time of his exit, Bannon said , \"I am definitely going to crush the opposition.\" He backed Moore in the Alabama Republican primary race to fill the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Republican Party leaders backed Strange, and Trump personally stumped for Strange days before the election against Moore. Meanwhile, Bannon campaigned for Moore, and his website ran a stream of articles bolstering the candidacy of the twice removed judge with a history of incendiary comments.

After defying ISIS, 'Kurds aren't afraid of anything' By Tamara Qiblawi, CNN Updated 1800 GMT (0200 HKT) September 27, 2017 \nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Irbil, Iraq (CNN) High-rise buildings surrounded by parks and villas pierce the skyline. Hotels and luxury cars dot the landscape. It would be easy to mistake this place for a neighborhood in uber-rich Dubai, but in fact it is downtown Irbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Ahmad, a taxi driver, motions proudly to signs of his city's rapid development. He points out newly-built bridges and luxury housing projects and gestures to the tarmacked roads and wide pavements. \"Look at all this,\" says Ahmad, his eyes aglow in the rearview mirror. \"People wonder why we want independence from Iraq, but all you need to do is look around you. We are light years ahead of Baghdad.\" For now, the Kurdish-governed northern Iraqi region remains an island of stability in war-weary Iraq. People in Irbil say this has come about despite the central government in Baghdad, not because of it. Kurdish leaders accuse the central government of widespread corruption, paving the way to many of Iraq's security woes -- including the rise of ISIS. Read More One of the largest Kurdistan flags in Irbil can be found draped over a large, hollowed-out luxury tower block. Its development ground to a halt in 2014 after ISIS emerged in nearby areas, putting an end to a nearly 10-year economic boom in the region. Call to arms for Baghdad But while the overwhelming 'yes' vote in Monday's referendum on Iraqi Kurdistan's independence was a materialization of the dreams of many Kurds, for Baghdad and its allies in Iran and Turkey, it is a call to arms. After issuing multiple condemnations in the run-up to the plebiscite, the Iraqi Parliament voted Monday to authorize the use of force against Iraqi Kurdistan. Baghdad has given the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) until Friday to hand over the airports it administers in Irbil and Sulaymaniyah. Kurdish voters have their say in a long-awaited referendum on independence from Iraq. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has declared the referendum \"null and void\" and his army has been conducting joint military exercises with the Iraqi army on their shared border. Meanwhile, Iran has threatened to seal its border with Iraqi Kurdistan, and has already closed its airspace to flights to and from the region. Both Turkey and Iran have restive Kurdish populations and fear that an independent Iraqi Kurdistan could galvanize their own nationalist movements. JUST WATCHED MUST WATCH Who are the Kurds? 01:40 And it's not just Iraqi Kurdistan's neighbors who are irked by the specter of secession. Stern warnings have also come from the United States, the United Kingdom and the United Nations Security Council, which all argue that the vote detracts from the fight against ISIS. In both Syria and Iraq, Kurdish fighters have been instrumental in the campaign against ISIS, which has left the terror group on its last legs. And Iraqi Kurdish leaders say it is time to reap the fruits of their labor. For Kurds, statehood has been over a century in the making. Their calls for a Kurdish nation were ignored in a 1916 British-French secret agreement, known as Sykes-Picot, that drew the boundaries of the modern-day Middle East. In the final treaty marking the conclusion of World War I, the Allies dropped demands for an autonomous Turkish Kurdistan. Instead, the Kurdish region was divided up among several countries. Party atmosphere at polls Drumbeats about war fall on deaf ears in the capital of would-be independent Kurdistan. At the supermarkets, there is no rush to stockpile supplies. Irbil's mayor even assured locals Tuesday that there was no cause for alarm because \"we have enough food for the next six months.\" When people flocked to the polling stations -- referendum officials say the turnout was 76% -- the atmosphere was more reminiscent of a party than a political event. Voters, many of them decked out in colorful traditional clothing, compared the referendum to the \"biggest Eid,\" a reference to an important Muslim holiday. A young Kurdish boy waves the Kurdish flag from a car on the streets of Irbil. Six-year-old Hidad wears an oversized head-wrap and traditional sirwal, or baggy trousers. He sticks his palm out to present three black pebbles. \"Each pebble tells Iraq 'I divorce you,'\" his father explains. In Islam, a marriage is considered dissolved when a man utters \"divorce\" three times in the presence of his wife. \"The people are happy, and the people are the ones who will determine their fate and will therefore bear the consequences,\" Aso Karim Mohamad, 64, tells CNN. Mohamad is a former member of the Kurdish Parliament who fought with the Peshmerga, the fighting force of Iraqi Kurdistan, in the bloody decade leading up to the creation of the KRG. Iraqi Kurds cast their votes in historic referendum In 1988, then-President Saddam Hussein's forces killed an estimated 100,000 Kurds and destroyed more than 4,000 villages. \"I voted in '92 for the first time for the first Kurdish Parliament after our intifada,\" he says, referring to the 1991 Kurdish uprising against Hussein. \"My feeling is the same today ... this is a great day in my life.\" For many of the people of Iraqi Kurdistan, the Peshmerga -- credited with being a driving force in the fight against ISIS -- are the very reason they are throwing caution to the wind. \"The Kurds aren't afraid of anything, because of the Peshmerga,\" Kafiah al Raouf Sadik, an educational official, tells CNN. \"God willing, we will achieve our goals here.\" Refugees vote for security At the Hassan Shami refugee camp midway between Mosul and Irbil, the mood is different. The sun beats down on inhabitants who spend their days standing in long food lines and end them sleeping in tarpaulin tents typically shared with around five other family members. The UN Security Council has said it fears that the lives of these refugees may fall into limbo. \"Council members note that the planned referendum ... could detract from efforts to ensure the safe, voluntary return of over three million refugees and internally displaced persons,\" the Security Council said in a news release. An Iraqi Kurdish man shows his ink-stained finger after voting in the Kurdish independence referendum. But camp manager Twana Anwar tells CNN he doesn't think their work will be affected: \"I'm not pessimistic ... Humanitarian efforts should go on as normal.\" The refugees here are mostly Arab, all survivors of ISIS, and they were invited to vote in Monday's referendum by the Kurdish charity group that controls the camp. What's at stake in Kurdish independence vote \"People voted for Kurdistan, they voted for security,\" says Abu Ali, standing among a crowd of men who gather around the CNN team near the camp's entrance. \"I lost everything, my car, my house. What should one do?\" the refugee from the destroyed town of Rabia asks. \"I hold Baghdad's government responsible for what happened to me. Security, security, security. People want security.\" Another Arab who works in the camp, Abu Mohammad, is an employee with the central government in Baghdad, but says he voted in favor of independence. \"If the Baghdad government were my dad, I would still vote against him,\" he says, sweat streaming down his face. 'We want safety' Further into the camp, an elderly man named Abu Raed huddles with his friends under the bottom of a water tank dressed in Arab robes, seeking respite from the scorching sun. He explains that the war with ISIS robbed him of all that he owns. \"I'm an old person and after all I've been through I'm tired of life,\" he says. \"It's a sin to say I want to die but I'm tired of life.\" A man walks through a refugee camp in Iraqi Kurdistan. \"After we saw ISIS, from what should we be afraid?\" asks Um Mohammad, a Turkmen mother-of-four who lost her husband during her family's escape from ISIS. A kite flies high over the camp, perhaps a better symbol than any other of the refugees' escape from ISIS -- like the Taliban in Afghanistan, the militant group had banned kite flying. Upon closer inspection, it turns out the kite was constructed from a plastic bag and sticks by Waddah, aged nine. \"We were under ISIS for two-and-a-half years,\" his father Salhab Hussein explains. \"The children played indoors ... this is why we voted for Kurdistan ... We don't care who rules over us -- Kurd, Arab or Turkmen -- as long as they give us safety.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "saddam hussein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hidad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu ali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohamad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu raed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raouf sadik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waddah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salhab hussein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hussein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twana anwar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aso karim mohamad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hassan shami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tamara qiblawi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu mohammad", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "isis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "united nations security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurdish parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taliban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraqi kurdistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraqi parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "irbil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurdistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sulaymaniyah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baghdad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T21:00:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d4404e524a7aa9df86f9331e7c4ee2e47389002c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGa6j0GHu4qiY5_9YIROJ8lm8mbgdwRQXwTyiCw7WykwM4ow8px2fbS08nBWAB3llBQAFjNs9Buw1FgQPUsR9oAQ--", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss\r", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - App International Edition", "title": "Saudi women driving could put chauffeurs out of work", "title_full": "Saudi women driving could put chauffeurs out of work", "published": "2017-09-27T20:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/161130145213-saudi-women-driving-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 256, "comments": 0, "shares": 256}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d4404e524a7aa9df86f9331e7c4ee2e47389002c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGa6j0GHu4qiY5_9YIROJ8lm8mbgdwRQXwTyiCw7WykwM4ow8px2fbS08nBWAB3llBQAFjNs9Buw1FgQPUsR9oAQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T20:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Saudi women driving could put chauffeurs out of work", "text": "Saudi chauffeurs may be out of work now women can drive by Zahraa Alkhalisi @CNNMoney September 27, 2017: 1:21 PM ET Saudi Arabia to allow women to drive Good news for Saudi women may be very bad news for the country's army of chauffeurs. Saudi Arabia announced Tuesday that it will lift a ban on women driving by June 2018. That will likely slash the demand for personal drivers, who are often employed to drive women to work. According to the latest official data, 1.4 million men work as drivers for private households. That's one for every 23 Saudis, and most of them come from south Asia. \nSaudi officials hope that the money women save on drivers -- on average $1,000 a month -- will remain in the local economy, rather than being sent as remittances to other countries. \nRelated: Women driving could rev up Saudi economy \nRide hailing apps such as Uber, and its big Middle East rival Careem, have recently offered women a cheaper alternative to hiring a private driver. \nBoth firms were quick to highlight the opportunities that the historic change would give women, rather than any loss of business. \n\"We're proud to have been able to provide extraordinary mobility for women in Saudi, and are excited by the economic opportunities this change could represent for them in the future,\" Uber said in a statement. \nWomen taxi drivers? \nCareem , which already has 80,000 drivers in Saudi Arabia, said it hoped women would be among the 20,000 or so it is planning to recruit there over the next four years. \n\"We believe this recent announcement from Saudi with regard to women being able to obtain a driver's license is a golden opportunity for women to gain additional income and help [increase] women's participation in the workforce,\" it said. \nAnd automakers were quick to see the potential upside of women needing their own cars. \nNissan ( NSANF ) tweeted: \"Congratulations to all Saudi women who will now be able to drive. #SaudiWomenDrive.\" \nWhile Ford ( F ) said \"A momentous day for women in Saudi!

Cell phone companies are sending emergency equipment and engineering crews by planes and barges to the island to address the crisis. \nAT&T ( T , Tech30 ) has sent four chartered planes with supplies, restoration team personnel and dozens of generators to the island, with more flights and barges expected in the near future. \nJeff Kobs, a spokesman for AT&T, says the company also \"plans to deploy a number of portable temporary cell sites.\" \n(AT&T has agreed to acquire Time Warner, the parent company of CNN. The deal is pending regulatory approval.) \nSprint ( S ) , another carrier that operates on the island, has sent one shipment of generators and other materials for restoration efforts, with a second shipment slated to arrive on Wednesday. \n\"Our headquarters on the Island in San Juan have resumed operations and are coordinating support efforts to re-establish communications in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands,\" says Lisa Belot, a spokeswoman for Sprint. \nRelated: These companies have pledged money to rebuild Puerto Rico \nThe recovery process is a group effort. \"All the wireless carriers are working together and sharing resources to get people back online as quickly as possible,\" a spokesperson for T-Mobile ( TMUS ) said in a statement. \"But it's a long road ahead.\" \nOn its website, T-Mobile highlights a daunting list of \"current challenges,\" including widespread power outages, severed fiber connections, and flooding that limits the ability to access sites. \nThis may explain why progress is slow going. Only 20% of cell towers in Puerto Rico are currently functioning, according to Luis Romero, VP of the Puerto Rico Telecommunications Alliance. \n\"Which means that 80% of all cell sites are down,\" Romero told CNN. \"Our number one priority is keeping what we have operational.\" \n\nThe cell sites, and all operational communication infrastructure in Puerto Rico, are currently running only on diesel generators, as there's no power coming from the power lines. \nThe result, according to Romero, is that communications companies need access to diesel fuel to maintain operations. Romero described one instance, at the Isla Verde Submarine cable landing, where diesel fuel was stolen out of a generator at night. \nTo make matters more complicated, workers need gasoline to drive between work sites and their homes. And they risk being held up at gunpoint on the road. \n\"We have to coordinate with police and there's not enough police,\" he says. \"We are asking the National Guard to get protection.\" \nCNNMoney (New York)   27, 2017: 1:56 PM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeff kobs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisa bloom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luis romero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romero", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "t-mobile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national guard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time warner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sprint", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico telecommunications alliance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "at&t", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico hurricane maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us virgin islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isla verde submarine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T21:02:52.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cd79c767897e496ed4bdc45eae5edebaa46fecb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGa6j0GHu4qibDrGcQIG6u2SDaNICrWlrqU4.j6PA7ehkw_VRlAWc5qjqGM5Zqdy1Xrq5cIo6w4k4-", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Latest financial news - CNNMoney.com", "title": "'This Is Us' scores big ratings as fall TV gets off to a strong start", "title_full": "'This Is Us' scores big ratings as fall TV gets off to a strong start - Sep. 27, 2017", "published": "2017-09-27T21:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170927114733-sterling-k-brown-this-is-us-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 132, "comments": 0, "shares": 132}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 6}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cd79c767897e496ed4bdc45eae5edebaa46fecb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGa6j0GHu4qibDrGcQIG6u2SDaNICrWlrqU4.j6PA7ehkw_VRlAWc5qjqGM5Zqdy1Xrq5cIo6w4k4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Frank Pallotta", "published": "2017-09-27T21:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "'This Is Us' scores big ratings as fall TV gets off to a strong start", "text": "'This Is Us' cast dish on show's future \" This Is Us \" may make its fans cry, but it's also making the bosses at NBC smile.

Call to arms for Baghdad But while the overwhelming 'yes' vote in Monday's referendum on Iraqi Kurdistan's independence was a materialization of the dreams of many Kurds, for Baghdad and its allies in Iran and Turkey, it is a call to arms. After issuing multiple condemnations in the run-up to the plebiscite, the Iraqi Parliament voted Monday to authorize the use of force against Iraqi Kurdistan. Baghdad has given the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) until Friday to hand over the airports it administers in Irbil and Sulaymaniyah. Kurdish voters have their say in a long-awaited referendum on independence from Iraq. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has declared the referendum \"null and void\" and his army has been conducting joint military exercises with the Iraqi army on their shared border. Meanwhile, Iran has threatened to seal its border with Iraqi Kurdistan, and has already closed its airspace to flights to and from the region. Both Turkey and Iran have restive Kurdish populations and fear that an independent Iraqi Kurdistan could galvanize their own nationalist movements. JUST WATCHED Who are the Kurds?\nWho are the Kurds? 01:40 And it's not just Iraqi Kurdistan's neighbors who are irked by the specter of secession. Stern warnings have also come from the United States, the United Kingdom and the United Nations Security Council, which all argue that the vote detracts from the fight against ISIS. In both Syria and Iraq, Kurdish fighters have been instrumental in the campaign against ISIS, which has left the terror group on its last legs. And Iraqi Kurdish leaders say it is time to reap the fruits of their labor. For Kurds, statehood has been over a century in the making. Their calls for a Kurdish nation were ignored in a 1916 British-French secret agreement, known as Sykes-Picot, that drew the boundaries of the modern-day Middle East. In the final treaty marking the conclusion of World War I, the Allies dropped demands for an autonomous Turkish Kurdistan. Instead, the Kurdish region was divided up among several countries. Party atmosphere at polls Drumbeats about war fall on deaf ears in the capital of would-be independent Kurdistan. At the supermarkets, there is no rush to stockpile supplies. Irbil's mayor even assured locals Tuesday that there was no cause for alarm because \"we have enough food for the next six months.\" When people flocked to the polling stations -- referendum officials say the turnout was 76% -- the atmosphere was more reminiscent of a party than a political event. Voters, many of them decked out in colorful traditional clothing, compared the referendum to the \"biggest Eid,\" a reference to an important Muslim holiday. A young Kurdish boy waves the Kurdish flag from a car on the streets of Irbil. Six-year-old Hidad wears an oversized head-wrap and traditional sirwal, or baggy trousers. He sticks his palm out to present three black pebbles. \"Each pebble tells Iraq 'I divorce you,'\" his father explains. In Islam, a marriage is considered dissolved when a man utters \"divorce\" three times in the presence of his wife. \"The people are happy, and the people are the ones who will determine their fate and will therefore bear the consequences,\" Aso Karim Mohamad, 64, tells CNN. Mohamad is a former member of the Kurdish Parliament who fought with the Peshmerga, the fighting force of Iraqi Kurdistan, in the bloody decade leading up to the creation of the KRG. Iraqi Kurds cast their votes in historic referendum In 1988, then-President Saddam Hussein's forces killed an estimated 100,000 Kurds and destroyed more than 4,000 villages. \"I voted in '92 for the first time for the first Kurdish Parliament after our intifada,\" he says, referring to the 1991 Kurdish uprising against Hussein. \"My feeling is the same today ... this is a great day in my life.\" For many of the people of Iraqi Kurdistan, the Peshmerga -- credited with being a driving force in the fight against ISIS -- are the very reason they are throwing caution to the wind. \"The Kurds aren't afraid of anything, because of the Peshmerga,\" Kafiah al Raouf Sadik, an educational official, tells CNN. \"God willing, we will achieve our goals here.\" Refugees vote for security At the Hassan Shami refugee camp midway between Mosul and Irbil, the mood is different. The sun beats down on inhabitants who spend their days standing in long food lines and end them sleeping in tarpaulin tents typically shared with around five other family members. The UN Security Council has said it fears that the lives of these refugees may fall into limbo. \"Council members note that the planned referendum ... could detract from efforts to ensure the safe, voluntary return of over three million refugees and internally displaced persons,\" the Security Council said in a news release. An Iraqi Kurdish man shows his ink-stained finger after voting in the Kurdish independence referendum. But camp manager Twana Anwar tells CNN he doesn't think their work will be affected: \"I'm not pessimistic ... Humanitarian efforts should go on as normal.\" The refugees here are mostly Arab, all survivors of ISIS, and they were invited to vote in Monday's referendum by the Kurdish charity group that controls the camp. What's at stake in Kurdish independence vote \"People voted for Kurdistan, they voted for security,\" says Abu Ali, standing among a crowd of men who gather around the CNN team near the camp's entrance. \"I lost everything, my car, my house. What should one do?\" the refugee from the destroyed town of Rabia asks. \"I hold Baghdad's government responsible for what happened to me. Security, security, security. People want security.\" Another Arab who works in the camp, Abu Mohammad, is an employee with the central government in Baghdad, but says he voted in favor of independence. \"If the Baghdad government were my dad, I would still vote against him,\" he says, sweat streaming down his face. 'We want safety' Further into the camp, an elderly man named Abu Raed huddles with his friends under the bottom of a water tank dressed in Arab robes, seeking respite from the scorching sun. He explains that the war with ISIS robbed him of all that he owns. \"I'm an old person and after all I've been through I'm tired of life,\" he says. \"It's a sin to say I want to die but I'm tired of life.\" A man walks through a refugee camp in Iraqi Kurdistan. \"After we saw ISIS, from what should we be afraid?\" asks Um Mohammad, a Turkmen mother-of-four who lost her husband during her family's escape from ISIS. A kite flies high over the camp, perhaps a better symbol than any other of the refugees' escape from ISIS -- like the Taliban in Afghanistan, the militant group had banned kite flying. Upon closer inspection, it turns out the kite was constructed from a plastic bag and sticks by Waddah, aged nine. \"We were under ISIS for two-and-a-half years,\" his father Salhab Hussein explains. \"The children played indoors ... this is why we voted for Kurdistan ... We don't care who rules over us -- Kurd, Arab or Turkmen -- as long as they give us safety.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "saddam hussein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hidad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu ali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohamad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu raed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raouf sadik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waddah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salhab hussein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hussein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twana anwar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aso karim mohamad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hassan shami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu mohammad", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "isis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "united nations security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurdish parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taliban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraqi kurdistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraqi parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "irbil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurdistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sulaymaniyah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baghdad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rabia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T21:10:13.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "73ef557934bd5fe86f5b1b3a9cd1d3dc21f4aa29", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWFaTaVfEUjSYU003SB13qKQv6P6S7z2_wf9QfaVjayWXZ1ljPVmQVlJyViFtv9BabNRwHn0JWO.hrYdnqz75eu4J1cCpzPNWLY-", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez team up for Puerto Rico relief effort - CNN", "title_full": "Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez team up for Puerto Rico relief effort - CNN", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170927094057-marc-anthony-and-jennifer-lopez-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 60022, "comments": 0, "shares": 60022}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "73ef557934bd5fe86f5b1b3a9cd1d3dc21f4aa29", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWFaTaVfEUjSYU003SB13qKQv6P6S7z2_wf9QfaVjayWXZ1ljPVmQVlJyViFtv9BabNRwHn0JWO.hrYdnqz75eu4J1cCpzPNWLY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sandra Gonzalez", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez team up for Puerto Rico relief effort - CNN", "text": "(CNN) Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez are joining forces to bring relief to Puerto Rico, which is in the midst of a humanitarian crisis after being hit by two hurricanes back-to-back.\nThe two superstars, who were previously married, have announced the creation of an initiative called Somos Una Voz, or We Are One Voice, that combines the clout of more than 30 figures from across sports and entertainment in the name of helping hurricane victims in Puerto Rico.

The Texas Republican's bill, first introduced in July, would invest $15 billion over four years in border infrastructure -- including physical barriers -- technology and personnel. A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate by fellow Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn. \"Now that we have a partner in the White House who has made this a top priority, it's time to send a bill to President (Donald) Trump's desk so we can deliver the American people the security they have long demanded and deserve,\" McCaul said. But while McCaul and Cornyn have worked on border security for years, and this proposal for months, the timing of the markup of the House homeland security committee could take on additional urgency with the debate raging in Congress over how to protect young undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children who were given the ability to work and study in the US under DACA. Read More DACA working groups form in Congress, but path forward remains at Trump's mercy When Trump announced the Obama-era program's end at the beginning of the month, he allowed renewals of the two-year permits to continue until March, when individuals protected will begin losing their DACA status. That has sparked a flurry of activity in Congress to try to codify the executive branch program into law. Democrats and most Republicans are in agreement on wanting to find a solution for the young people who have in many cases known no other home than the US, but deep divisions remain over what that should look like. Republicans, including Trump, are demanding that any DACA deal include border security and possibly interior enforcement. House Speaker Paul Ryan has put together an immigration working group of Republicans that includes McCaul to come up with options the House GOP could get behind. A source familiar with the process downplayed the timing, saying the bill might have been marked up months ago but was slowed down by working through input from the administration. McCaul's Border Security for America Act would require \"physical barriers\" and technology to be deployed on the Southern border, would increase air and marine patrols, would add 5,000 border agents and 5,000 customs officers, would waive polygraph requirements for a narrow set of Customs and Border Protection applicants and would mandate an entry-exit system for entering and leaving the United States that collects biometric information. Of the total investment, $10 billion would be for new border security and $5 billion would be for modernizing ports of entry. DACA deal: Here are just some of the things that could go wrong Other provisions in the bill include authorizations for the National Guard and Defense Department to loan troops and supplies to the border security effort with reimbursement from the federal government -- though they would not be authorized to do immigration enforcement tasks. The measure may be controversial, though there is precedent. In 2010, President Barack Obama deployed 1,200 National Guard troops to the Southern border to fight drug crime and provide intelligence, and in 2014, then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry sent troops to his state's border with Mexico amid a surge of undocumented immigrants. The bill would allow for the National Guard and military to engage in activities like building, intelligence gathering and surveillance. Another potentially controversial measure would waive a number of federal laws to give Customs and Border Protection nearly absolute access to the border to conduct its patrols and for security needs, prohibiting federal agencies including environmental agencies from restricting that. The legislation would also require the department to conduct a security assessment of the southern border and submit strategic plans for securing it going forward.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccaul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cornyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rick perry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike mccaul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald) trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john cornyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul ryan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "daca", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national guard and defense department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deferred action for childhood arrivals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national guard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "border protection", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "customs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house gop", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T21:20:42.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c151c018450721f199605713b7a4a6aa31cb2e58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWHmmLva1gTF_c2fEWTJPDhn3nab8Q_MOVnmVfH_OxtKI.faiSCJsmAg4PC89yexAycIzDk55HKg1Q--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Otto Warmbier: Coroner releases exam - CNN", "title_full": "Otto Warmbier: Coroner releases exam - CNN", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160122111735-01-otto-warmbier-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3124, "comments": 0, "shares": 3124}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c151c018450721f199605713b7a4a6aa31cb2e58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWHmmLva1gTF_c2fEWTJPDhn3nab8Q_MOVnmVfH_OxtKI.faiSCJsmAg4PC89yexAycIzDk55HKg1Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Nedelman, CNN", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Otto Warmbier: Coroner releases exam - CNN", "text": "Story highlights A coroner's report on Otto Warmbier cannot determine what caused his brain damage Warmbier's parents declined a full autopsy, which may have offered additional details (CNN) Details surrounding Otto Warmbier, the 22-year-old American student who died in June after being detained in North Korea for 17 months, were released this week by the Hamilton County Coroner's office in Ohio.\nThe report -- an external examination, not an autopsy -- describes a 4.3-by-1.6-inch scar on Warmbier's right foot. Parents Fred and Cindy Warmbier mentioned this scar during an interview with CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Tuesday, when they broke their three-month silence. \"How do you get a scar that covers the entire top of your foot?\" Cindy Warmbier asked. \"(The coroner) said it had to be an open wound for months and months and months.\" What an autopsy may (or may not) have revealed about Otto Warmbier's death The coroner's report did not include this last detail. It describes a number of smaller scars, but does not contain details as to what caused them or how long they had been there. The report also offers information that seemingly conflicts with his parents' account. Read More \"His bottom teeth look like they had taken a pair of pliers and rearranged them,\" Fred Warmbier said. However, the coroner's report says, \"the teeth are natural and in good repair.\" Hamilton County Coroner Dr. Lakshmi Kode Sammarco addressed the discrepancy, speaking at a news conference Wednesday. She said her team, which included a forensic dentist, evaluated Warmbier's body as well as various scans of his body. \"I felt very comfortable that there wasn't any evidence of trauma\" to the teeth or jawbone, Sammarco said. \"We were surprised at (the parents') statement.\" Fred Warmbier told CNN on Wednesday the family will not be commenting further. A North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman on Thursday denied that Warmbier was tortured while in North Korean custody, according to a report by the country's state-run news agency KCNA. Unresponsive wakefulness On Tuesday, Warmbier's parents described what they saw when they approached the plane that returned their son in June. \"We weren't prepared for this at all,\" said Cindy Warmbier. \"No one had any idea, going in there, what we were going to see.\" \"Halfway up the stairs, we hear this loud, guttural, howling, inhuman sound. We don't know what it is,\" Fred Warmbier said. \"He's strapped to the stretcher, and he's moving around and jerking violently, making these howling, inhuman sounds.\" Warmbier's eyes were darting around, \"as big as saucers,\" his father said. His head was shaved, and he had a feeding tube in place. His hands and legs were \"totally deformed,\" Cindy Warmbier said. The coroner's report describes abnormal flexing of the arms and legs, which it attributes to severe brain damage from not getting enough oxygen. In June, doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center described his state as \"unresponsive wakefulness,\" a product of this brain damage. Otto Warmbier: What is unresponsive wakefulness? For people in this condition, \"their eyes may be open, they may be blinking, they may be even looking around, but they have no awareness of their surroundings,\" CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said in June. Gupta has not reviewed Warmbier's medical records. \"There's nothing that is voluntary in terms of movements, even though their eyes are open,\" Gupta added. \"Some refer to it as a persistent vegetative state.\" The coroner's report lists the cause of death as an \"unknown insult more than a year prior to death\" and the complications of his brain injury. An MRI from April 2016 provided by North Korea showed brain damage that doctors suspected to be weeks old at that point, Gupta said. Dr. Daniel Kanter , one of Warmbier's doctors and director of UC Health's Neurocritical Care Program , said brain scans in June showed \"extensive loss of brain tissue in all regions of the brain\" but no evidence of a skull fracture. CT scans of the body similarly showed no evidence of recent or healing bone fractures, Kanter said in June when asked if there were any signs of trauma or injuries. Sammarco said on Wednesday that the post-mortem examination found no obvious signs of torture. Questions continue to swirl around how this happened -- and specifically, what happened to him in North Korean custody. On the coroner's report, Warmbier's manner of death is listed as \"undetermined.\" 'Otto is at peace' Fred Warmbier alleged on Tuesday that \"Otto was systematically tortured and intentionally injured\" by Kim Jong Un's regime. \"This was no accident.\" However, Warmbier's parents declined a full autopsy. \"The family's objection to an autopsy was honored, and only an external examination was performed,\" the coroner's office said in a statement in June. Family declines autopsy for former North Korea detainee Otto Warmbier \"I think it's a terrible mistake\" not to perform an autopsy, Dr. Cyril Wecht , a prominent forensic pathologist who was not involved in Warmbier's case, previously told CNN. \"If you have something that could be anything other than a natural death, you're obligated to do an autopsy.\" Still, Wecht said it would be difficult to determine what caused Warmbier's brain damage, especially in someone who had been that way for such a long time. It could have been any number of things that prevented sufficient oxygen from reaching the brain, Wecht said, including strangulation, suffocation, medication or a botched suicide attempt. Sammarco said that either blood wasn't getting to the brain, or Warmbier wasn't breathing, but her examination could not draw concrete conclusions. \"One of a few things likely happened here -- and we may never know, especially if there's no autopsy,\" Gupta, who is also a member of the American College of Forensic Examiners and a practicing neurosurgeon, said in June.

The views expressed are his own. \n(CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions is maybe the worst person in the country to scold others about the need to cherish constitutional rights, as he did this week at Georgetown University . Or maybe only the second worst, because it's hard to top the hypocrisy of his boss.\nAccording to Sessions , college campuses have created too many safe spaces and have quashed dissent. \"Freedom of speech and thought on the American campus are under attack,\" Sessions told a small crowd Tuesday at Georgetown. Issac Bailey While he was speaking, I was preparing for a class later that day. I teach two journalism seminars at Davidson College in North Carolina. That day's session included a presentation by two white students leading a discussion about Fox News commentator Juan Williams' controversial book , \"Enough: The Phony Leaders, Dead-End Movements, and Culture of Failure That Are Undermining Black America -- and What We Can Do About it.\" (Williams is also known for groundbreaking work about the civil rights movement, among many other career highlights.) My class is diverse and part of the college's Africana Studies Department. To complete the assignment, the two student presenters had to demonstrate they fully understood the subject matter, took it seriously -- no matter their personal views and preferences -- and could explain how it related to a 20-year-old shooting at Davidson that involved the deaths of a young black man and a young white cop. Their classmates got to challenge everything they said. Read More There were numerous passionate exchanges in my classroom as students grappled with major moments included in Williams' book, including Bill Cosby's now-infamous \"pound cake\" speech during a 50th anniversary celebration of the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling, which prompted Williams to write the book. Are things such as the racial gaps in educational achievement, the crime rate and income inequality the result of individual black failure and irresponsibility, systemic problems, or both? Are black leaders failing us because they don't scold rappers who use ugly, misogynistic language and glorify the worst parts of their upbringings? Or are rappers speaking hard truths in ways designed to reach an intended audience that may miss the message if they said it differently? Free speech doesn't come in zones I noticed a few students looking my way, hoping I'd intervene during a few particularly unnerving moments in class discussion. I didn't. The students struggled through and got to a good place themselves, as they always find a way to do. They are tougher and smarter and braver than Sessions seems to realize. To double down on the point I wanted to get across -- that we must cherish vigorous critical thinking -- I assigned each of them a short paper in which they must explain why those with whom they disagreed might be right. That class, like so many others occurring at Davidson and at other colleges and universities throughout the country, was a safe space, but not in the way that critics such as Sessions might think of it. It was a safe space to rigorously debate and discuss the most vexing issues of the day in ways that weren't always comfortable, to reflect upon how we became who we are now as a country, to be confronted with the harrowing stories of those around us that often go unnoted, to learn, to think, to research, to challenge and be challenged. The students I've come across get it better than those screaming that 21st-century college students are \"snowflakes.\" They got it when I explained why I don't give trigger warnings when those who disagreed with that decision engaged in a grown-up conversation about it instead of walking out of the room. That's why it is a bit galling to hear a man such as Sessions claim there's a liberal attack on free speech when he heads a Justice Department that prosecuted a woman for giggling during his confirmation hearing and plans to prosecute her again. It's hard to take his supposed love for our constitutional rights seriously when he has worked to re-up a civil asset forfeiture program that takes away the property of Americans who have been convicted of no crimes -- and often hadn't even been charged. Join us on Twitter and Facebook \n\n\nIt's galling to hear a man scolding colleges and universities about free speech, then defending his boss, President Donald Trump, who spent this past weekend using his position as the most powerful government official in the country to advocate the firing of private citizens who are saying and doing things he doesn't like. Someone needs to tell Sessions that the First Amendment frowns upon governmental power being used that way. If Sessions was so committed to free speech on campus, why didn't he insist that those faculty who took a knee to protest his appearance or students shouting questions from outside the building be allowed to participate in a question-and-answer session after his speech? Maybe there was a snowflake on the Georgetown campus on Tuesday after all.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "issac bailey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "davidson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill cosby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james k. batten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juan williams", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davidson college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the charlotte observer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africana studies department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brown v. board of education supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard university nieman", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "black america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T21:21:28.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "21a64e40320ec6f40e593e64b49cdbe37f50afba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKeHeAlPXHMGVusWodRO17bysG9GqT4BV.P9PGYmQdCVB_TV.hA_kcakpXe3x3C5V1Q--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Michelle Obama: 'Any woman who voted against Hillary Clinton voted against their own voice' - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Michelle Obama: 'Any woman who voted against Hillary Clinton voted against their own voice' - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170427173504-michelle-obama-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "21a64e40320ec6f40e593e64b49cdbe37f50afba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKeHeAlPXHMGVusWodRO17bysG9GqT4BV.P9PGYmQdCVB_TV.hA_kcakpXe3x3C5V1Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jennifer Hansler", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Michelle Obama: 'Any woman who voted against Hillary Clinton voted against their own voice' - CNNPolitics", "text": "(CNN) In candid remarks Wednesday, former first lady Michelle Obama said women who voted for Republican nominee Donald Trump over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton went against their \"authentic voice\" in the 2016 presidential election.\n\"Any woman who voted against Hillary Clinton voted against their own voice,\" she said at the Inbound 2017 conference in Boston, according to video from inside the event. \"What does it mean for us as women that we look at those two candidates, as women, and many of us said, that guy, he's better for me, his voice is more true to me,\" Obama said. \"Well, to me that just says you don't like your voice.

According to Sessions , college campuses have created too many safe spaces and have quashed dissent. \"Freedom of speech and thought on the American campus are under attack,\" Sessions told a small crowd Tuesday at Georgetown. Issac Bailey While he was speaking, I was preparing for a class later that day. I teach two journalism seminars at Davidson College in North Carolina. That day's session included a presentation by two white students leading a discussion about Fox News commentator Juan Williams' controversial book , \"Enough: The Phony Leaders, Dead-End Movements, and Culture of Failure That Are Undermining Black America -- and What We Can Do About it.\" (Williams is also known for groundbreaking work about the civil rights movement, among many other career highlights.) My class is diverse and part of the college's Africana Studies Department. To complete the assignment, the two student presenters had to demonstrate they fully understood the subject matter, took it seriously -- no matter their personal views and preferences -- and could explain how it related to a 20-year-old shooting at Davidson that involved the deaths of a young black man and a young white cop. Their classmates got to challenge everything they said. Read More There were numerous passionate exchanges in my classroom as students grappled with major moments included in Williams' book, including Bill Cosby's now-infamous \"pound cake\" speech during a 50th anniversary celebration of the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling, which prompted Williams to write the book. Are things such as the racial gaps in educational achievement, the crime rate and income inequality the result of individual black failure and irresponsibility, systemic problems, or both? Are black leaders failing us because they don't scold rappers who use ugly, misogynistic language and glorify the worst parts of their upbringings? Or are rappers speaking hard truths in ways designed to reach an intended audience that may miss the message if they said it differently? Free speech doesn't come in zones I noticed a few students looking my way, hoping I'd intervene during a few particularly unnerving moments in class discussion. I didn't. The students struggled through and got to a good place themselves, as they always find a way to do. They are tougher and smarter and braver than Sessions seems to realize. To double down on the point I wanted to get across -- that we must cherish vigorous critical thinking -- I assigned each of them a short paper in which they must explain why those with whom they disagreed might be right. That class, like so many others occurring at Davidson and at other colleges and universities throughout the country, was a safe space, but not in the way that critics such as Sessions might think of it. It was a safe space to rigorously debate and discuss the most vexing issues of the day in ways that weren't always comfortable, to reflect upon how we became who we are now as a country, to be confronted with the harrowing stories of those around us that often go unnoted, to learn, to think, to research, to challenge and be challenged. The students I've come across get it better than those screaming that 21st-century college students are \"snowflakes.\" They got it when I explained why I don't give trigger warnings when those who disagreed with that decision engaged in a grown-up conversation about it instead of walking out of the room. That's why it is a bit galling to hear a man such as Sessions claim there's a liberal attack on free speech when he heads a Justice Department that prosecuted a woman for giggling during his confirmation hearing and plans to prosecute her again. It's hard to take his supposed love for our constitutional rights seriously when he has worked to re-up a civil asset forfeiture program that takes away the property of Americans who have been convicted of no crimes -- and often hadn't even been charged. \nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook It's galling to hear a man scolding colleges and universities about free speech, then defending his boss, President Donald Trump, who spent this past weekend using his position as the most powerful government official in the country to advocate the firing of private citizens who are saying and doing things he doesn't like. Someone needs to tell Sessions that the First Amendment frowns upon governmental power being used that way. If Sessions was so committed to free speech on campus, why didn't he insist that those faculty who took a knee to protest his appearance or students shouting questions from outside the building be allowed to participate in a question-and-answer session after his speech? Maybe there was a snowflake on the Georgetown campus on Tuesday after all.

Parents Fred and Cindy Warmbier mentioned this scar during an interview with CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Tuesday, when they broke their three-month silence. \"How do you get a scar that covers the entire top of your foot?\" Cindy Warmbier asked. \"(The coroner) said it had to be an open wound for months and months and months.\" What an autopsy may (or may not) have revealed about Otto Warmbier's death The coroner's report did not include this last detail. It describes a number of smaller scars, but does not contain details as to what caused them or how long they had been there. The report also offers information that seemingly conflicts with his parents' account. Read More \"His bottom teeth look like they had taken a pair of pliers and rearranged them,\" Fred Warmbier said. However, the coroner's report says, \"the teeth are natural and in good repair.\" Hamilton County Coroner Dr. Lakshmi Kode Sammarco addressed the discrepancy, speaking at a news conference Wednesday. She said her team, which included a forensic dentist, evaluated Warmbier's body as well as various scans of his body. \"I felt very comfortable that there wasn't any evidence of trauma\" to the teeth or jawbone, Sammarco said. \"We were surprised at (the parents') statement.\" Fred Warmbier told CNN on Wednesday the family will not be commenting further. A North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman on Thursday denied that Warmbier was tortured while in North Korean custody, according to a report by the country's state-run news agency KCNA. Unresponsive wakefulness On Tuesday, Warmbier's parents described what they saw when they approached the plane that returned their son in June. \"We weren't prepared for this at all,\" said Cindy Warmbier. \"No one had any idea, going in there, what we were going to see.\" \"Halfway up the stairs, we hear this loud, guttural, howling, inhuman sound. We don't know what it is,\" Fred Warmbier said. \"He's strapped to the stretcher, and he's moving around and jerking violently, making these howling, inhuman sounds.\" Warmbier's eyes were darting around, \"as big as saucers,\" his father said. His head was shaved, and he had a feeding tube in place. His hands and legs were \"totally deformed,\" Cindy Warmbier said. The coroner's report describes abnormal flexing of the arms and legs, which it attributes to severe brain damage from not getting enough oxygen. In June, doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center described his state as \"unresponsive wakefulness,\" a product of this brain damage. Otto Warmbier: What is unresponsive wakefulness? For people in this condition, \"their eyes may be open, they may be blinking, they may be even looking around, but they have no awareness of their surroundings,\" CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said in June. Gupta has not reviewed Warmbier's medical records. \"There's nothing that is voluntary in terms of movements, even though their eyes are open,\" Gupta added. \"Some refer to it as a persistent vegetative state.\" The coroner's report lists the cause of death as an \"unknown insult more than a year prior to death\" and the complications of his brain injury. An MRI from April 2016 provided by North Korea showed brain damage that doctors suspected to be weeks old at that point, Gupta said. Dr. Daniel Kanter , one of Warmbier's doctors and director of UC Health's Neurocritical Care Program , said brain scans in June showed \"extensive loss of brain tissue in all regions of the brain\" but no evidence of a skull fracture. CT scans of the body similarly showed no evidence of recent or healing bone fractures, Kanter said in June when asked if there were any signs of trauma or injuries. Sammarco said on Wednesday that the post-mortem examination found no obvious signs of torture. Questions continue to swirl around how this happened -- and specifically, what happened to him in North Korean custody. On the coroner's report, Warmbier's manner of death is listed as \"undetermined.\" 'Otto is at peace' Fred Warmbier alleged on Tuesday that \"Otto was systematically tortured and intentionally injured\" by Kim Jong Un's regime. \"This was no accident.\" However, Warmbier's parents declined a full autopsy. \"The family's objection to an autopsy was honored, and only an external examination was performed,\" the coroner's office said in a statement in June. Family declines autopsy for former North Korea detainee Otto Warmbier \"I think it's a terrible mistake\" not to perform an autopsy, Dr. Cyril Wecht , a prominent forensic pathologist who was not involved in Warmbier's case, previously told CNN. \"If you have something that could be anything other than a natural death, you're obligated to do an autopsy.\" Still, Wecht said it would be difficult to determine what caused Warmbier's brain damage, especially in someone who had been that way for such a long time. It could have been any number of things that prevented sufficient oxygen from reaching the brain, Wecht said, including strangulation, suffocation, medication or a botched suicide attempt. Sammarco said that either blood wasn't getting to the brain, or Warmbier wasn't breathing, but her examination could not draw concrete conclusions. \"One of a few things likely happened here -- and we may never know, especially if there's no autopsy,\" Gupta, who is also a member of the American College of Forensic Examiners and a practicing neurosurgeon, said in June. Sammarco said that her team discussed a potential autopsy. \"We felt like nothing was going to be gained from an autopsy, and we honored the family's wishes,\" Sammarco said on Wednesday. Join\nWarmbier's parents, when asked on Tuesday why they refused an autopsy, said that they wanted the ordeal to be put to rest. \"Otto and our family have been through enough. Enough,\" Fred Warmbier said. \"Otto is at peace, and it's about time.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "otto", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "otto warmbi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "warmbier", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coroner", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gupta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanjay gupta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "otto warmbier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel kanter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cindy warmbier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooke baldwin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred warmbier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kanter", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uc health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of cincinnati medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamilton county coroner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neurocritical care program", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T21:30:15.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5755b5c1a1494a129e4a401486af03ade86719ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INm9.SeExHSYLGql3zIsNSiAQXkdmdw0.Eebcl5HjyAg3fHx0QmRKZxEe_cqyE73BOWFVTEs96Uq3sxo02HZ4pvm4ektv.XcoSpw0qMPC3owE-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_freevideo", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com -

You cannot have people disrespecting our national anthem, our flag, our country. And in my opinion, the NFL has to change or you know what's going to happen, in my opinion, their business is going to go to hell,\" Trump said outside the White House Wednesday as he prepared to board Marine One. The number of times Trump has tweeted about the NFL vs Puerto Rico The President's criticism sparked a massive response from nearly every NFL team during football games on Sunday and Monday, with more players choosing to kneel and players, owners and coaches linking arms during or before the National Anthem in response to Trumps' comments. Trump even drew stiff rebukes from several NFL owners who supported him during his presidential campaign and cut big checks to his inaugural committee. Trump has also faced criticism for focusing the brunt of his tweets and public messaging on stirring the NFL controversy, rather than addressing the increasingly desperate situation in Puerto Rico , which was devastated by a hurricane. Trump pushed back on that during a news conference Tuesday, saying he was \"not at all\" preoccupied with the controversy. Read More Some NFL broadcasts have seen their ratings dip and Trump has said the drop in ratings is a result of the protests, though the connection is less than clear. Trump added Wednesday that \"there are plenty of places\" where NFL players could protest. \"When they are protesting during a football game, I think they can find better places,\" Trump said. \"But they cannot do it during the National Anthem.\" Asked Wednesday whether his criticism undermines NFL players' right to free speech as protected under the First Amendment, Trump said \"no, not at all\" and argued that most NFL fans agree with him. \"I mean, largely the fans agree. But we have to show total respect for our national anthem,\" he said. CNN's Noah Gray contributed to this report.

The House homeland security committee will mark up the bill next week, Chairman Mike McCaul announced Wednesday. The Texas Republican's bill, first introduced in July, would invest $15 billion over four years in border infrastructure -- including physical barriers -- technology and personnel. A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate by fellow Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn. \"Now that we have a partner in the White House who has made this a top priority, it's time to send a bill to President (Donald) Trump's desk so we can deliver the American people the security they have long demanded and deserve,\" McCaul said. But while McCaul and Cornyn have worked on border security for years, and this proposal for months, the timing of the markup of the House homeland security committee could take on additional urgency with the debate raging in Congress over how to protect young undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children who were given the ability to work and study in the US under DACA. Read More DACA working groups form in Congress, but path forward remains at Trump's mercy When Trump announced the Obama-era program's end at the beginning of the month, he allowed renewals of the two-year permits to continue until March, when individuals protected will begin losing their DACA status. That has sparked a flurry of activity in Congress to try to codify the executive branch program into law. Democrats and most Republicans are in agreement on wanting to find a solution for the young people who have in many cases known no other home than the US, but deep divisions remain over what that should look like. Republicans, including Trump, are demanding that any DACA deal include border security and possibly interior enforcement. House Speaker Paul Ryan has put together an immigration working group of Republicans that includes McCaul to come up with options the House GOP could get behind. A source familiar with the process downplayed the timing, saying the bill might have been marked up months ago but was slowed down by working through input from the administration. McCaul's Border Security for America Act would require \"physical barriers\" and technology to be deployed on the Southern border, would increase air and marine patrols, would add 5,000 border agents and 5,000 customs officers, would waive polygraph requirements for a narrow set of Customs and Border Protection applicants and would mandate an entry-exit system for entering and leaving the United States that collects biometric information. Of the total investment, $10 billion would be for new border security and $5 billion would be for modernizing ports of entry. DACA deal: Here are just some of the things that could go wrong Other provisions in the bill include authorizations for the National Guard and Defense Department to loan troops and supplies to the border security effort with reimbursement from the federal government -- though they would not be authorized to do immigration enforcement tasks. The measure may be controversial, though there is precedent. In 2010, President Barack Obama deployed 1,200 National Guard troops to the Southern border to fight drug crime and provide intelligence, and in 2014, then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry sent troops to his state's border with Mexico amid a surge of undocumented immigrants. The bill would allow for the National Guard and military to engage in activities like building, intelligence gathering and surveillance. Another potentially controversial measure would waive a number of federal laws to give Customs and Border Protection nearly absolute access to the border to conduct its patrols and for security needs, prohibiting federal agencies including environmental agencies from restricting that. The legislation would also require the department to conduct a security assessment of the southern border and submit strategic plans for securing it going forward.

(CNN) Ten posters displaying the Confederate flag with a cotton stem attached to each have been discovered at American University -- the latest racist incident targeting black students at the school. The posters were found in three buildings across the university's Washington campus Tuesday, the same night the school introduced plans for an Antiracist Research and Policy Center . \"The significance of these posters appearing on the same night that Dr. Ibram Kendi shared his vision for the AU Antiracist Research and Policy Center cannot be ignored,\" the college's student government said in a statement . \"The significance of this occurring as our country continues to struggle with its history of white supremacy also cannot be ignored.\" The posters were pinned to bulletin boards and left inside glass display cases. Each was emblazoned with the Confederate flag and the text: \"Huzzah for DIXIE. I wish I was in the Land of Cotton!\" Read More On Wednesday, the college released a video of a man suspected of putting the posters: a white male wearing an orange hard hat and neon vest. He is seen walking through a university hallway. Can you identify the suspect in last night's defacing property bias-related incident?

Scribbled on the bananas was the phrase \"AKA Free,\" a reference to Dumpson's membership in the historically black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha. Last year, students at a residence hall reported white students leaving a rotten banana at one black freshman's door and throwing a banana at another black student, the school newspaper reported.

Murphy and Michelle Krupa, CNN Updated 4:18 PM EDT, Wed September 27, 2017 Story highlights In Maria's wake, shortwave radio has been key to communicating in Puerto Rico Fifty amateur ham radio operators are headed there to support recovery operations \n(CNN) The phone call from the Red Cross came in late Friday night, just as the full scale of Hurricane Maria's calamity began taking shape. \n\"We need 50 of your best radio operators to go down to Puerto Rico.\" \nIn the days after the worst storm in three generations hit the American island -- and for many more to come -- public electrical, land-line and cellular communication systems showed few signs of life. And radio networks used routinely by police officers, power company workers and other first responder still were down. \nYet, a key mode of communication -- one not reliant on infrastructure vulnerable to strong winds and flooding -- still crackled: the \"ham\" radio. \nAnswering the phone that night in Connecticut was the emergency manager for the American Radio Relay League, the group's CEO said. For more than a century, this group has served as a hub for amateurs licensed to operate the dependable, if archaic, medium known as ham radio and eager to pitch in when disaster strikes. \nWhen the Red Cross made its latest appeal for heroes, these were the people it had in mind. Jumping to respond to disaster \nAlready gearing up on his own that night to go to work, turning knobs and flipping switches, was Oscar Resto. \nAs one of dozens of ham -- shorthand for \"amateur\" -- operators across Puerto Rico, Resto had been authorized by the Federal Communications Commission to use radios, computers, satellites or the Internet to assist and support public safety during emergencies . \nOften untethered from wires and cables, operators share information by voice, Morse code and other methods on a wide range of frequencies above the AM broadcast band. Such communications were critical during rescue operations after the 9/11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina . \nFor three days after Maria hit, Resto sawed through the downed trees that separated his home from the road, he told CNN. Then he packed his car with radio gear, left his family and made the 25-mile journey to a makeshift Red Cross headquarters, where generators and batteries could power his equipment. \n\"I have the responsibility to establish the required emergency communications that the American Red Cross needed for understanding the needs of the citizens impacted by the hurricane,\" said Resto, a section manager for the American Radio Relay League , which boasts 160,000 members. \nSurvivors needed food, water, shelter and fuel to power generators after Maria knocked out the entire electrical grid. They also needed to communicate, to share critical information about diabetics nearing the end of their insulin reserves , babies threatened by dehydration, families rationing crackers . \nTransmitting radio signals to other ham operators in the Caribbean, Resto and his shortwave brethren traded National Hurricane Center reports on Maria's position. He also contacted a ham operator in Florida, and asked \"just to tell my daughter, Astrid, that we were fine,\" he recalled. \nBefore long, Resto and his compatriots realized their messages were the only ones getting off the island. \nIn an instant, their mission expanded: Anyone with the requisite skills and equipment was conscripted. Shoulder to shoulder with first responders \nTwo ham volunteers, Raul Gonzalez and Jose Santiago, set up a radio control hub run by generator power in Monacillo, near San Juan, and other centers quickly followed suit. There, ham operators work shoulder to shoulder with public safety and utility officials to transmit information to other ham operators working with teams in the field. \nA full week after Maria battered their homes, Resto and two dozen other Puerto Rican ham operators were still running radio operations for the police and the local power company, whose own wireless communications systems rely in part on computers and power sources knocked out by the storm. \nFor instance, ham operators riding with police use radios tuned to the special broadcast frequencies to transmit calls to other ham operators hunkered down at the command centers with officers, who in turn respond with orders. \nA power company generator low on fuel? A ham operator from Resto's team deployed with the power company calls his counterpart at the command center and coordinates a fuel delivery. \nFor his part, Resto learned Tuesday via a ham radio at the command center that an unsanitary hospital in western Puerto Rico was transferring patients to another hospital. It was just one of countless threads of information squawked across the operational frequencies in a massive effort to deliver relief and supplies. \n\"I am very proud of them,\" Resto said of his crew of amateurs. \"They are the real heroes.\" More help on the way \nLess than 48 hours after the American Radio Relay League's emergency manager fielded the Red Cross' call, 350 ham operators had offered to help, said Tom Gallagher, the group's CEO. \nFifty of them prepared this week to embark upon a three-week deployment to Puerto Rico. They include retired executives and public safety officers, and hail from places from Washington to Texas to New Hampshire, he said. \n\"It's an incredibly personal sacrifice from individuals who are dedicated to serving communities,\" Gallagher said. \"They have the skills and the motivation and the sense of responsibility.\" \nVolunteers will be outfitted with self-sustaining kits provided by radio manufacturers and dealer partners so they can be agile and won't burden those they're trying to help, he said. \nSouthwest Airlines was due to transport the equipment for free Wednesday from the group's New York headquarters to Atlanta, where volunteers planned to convene Thursday to board a chartered JetBlue flight for San Juan, Gallagher said. \nThere, they plan to connect with the Red Cross and likely spread out across Puerto Rico to continue the life-saving work of radio operators already well underway, Gallagher said. \n\"It's the first time they've asked us to do this on this scale,\" he said. \"This is why we're here.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maria", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "morse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom gallagher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gallagher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raul gonzalez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "resto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose santiago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "astrid", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "red cross", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "american radio relay league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal communications commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southwest airlines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oscar resto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "resto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jetblue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national hurricane center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico fifty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monacillo control center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hampshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monacillo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T22:09:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1992e90ebf0ee2b0ff2354d963ebfce3e465adf1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKZruzampAK9kcNZwfzIeezQz1BGTO.3wcMSQihwfm1_sdo5Om_lpCq47.WonA.zKlgtbMfrAuEn.", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Trump tax reform plan set for unveiling in Indianapolis - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Trump tax reform plan set for unveiling in Indianapolis - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170925112512-04-trump-09-24-2017-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2375, "comments": 0, "shares": 2375}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 35}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1992e90ebf0ee2b0ff2354d963ebfce3e465adf1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKZruzampAK9kcNZwfzIeezQz1BGTO.3wcMSQihwfm1_sdo5Om_lpCq47.WonA.zKlgtbMfrAuEn.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jeremy Diamond", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trump tax reform plan set for unveiling in Indianapolis - CNNPolitics", "text": "Story highlights Trump drew from the stories of ordinary Americans The framework also calls for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20% (CNN) President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled a Republican framework for tax reform that calls for sweeping tax cuts and a simplification of the tax code, framing the effort in a speech as a historic opportunity.\n\"This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I guess it's probably something I could say that I'm very good at,\" Trump said during remarks in Indiana. \"I've been waiting for this for a long time. We're going to cut taxes for the middle class, make the tax code simpler and more fair for everyday Americans. And we are going to bring back the jobs and wealth that have left our country and most people thought left our country for good.\" Details of GOP tax reform framework revealed Trump in recent weeks has sought to crank up public pressure on the need for sweeping tax reform. In Indianapolis, he offered specific numbers to back up his calls for the biggest changes to the tax code in decades. He called for reducing the personal income tax brackets from seven to three (12%, 25% and 35%), doubling the standard deduction for married and single filers (to $24,000 and $12,000 respectively), slashing the corporate tax rate to 20% and eliminating the estate tax -- among other proposals. Trump vows GOP will continue efforts to repeal Obamacare Read More Trump sought to give the Republican-crafted framework a populist touch, framing the tax reform proposal as a boon for the middle class, American workers and American manufacturing. The President said his tax cut proposal wouldn't help the country's wealthiest taxpayers, like himself, as he promised to strip away tax breaks and loopholes. \"It's not good for me, believe me,\" Trump said. The claim was impossible to verify, though, as Trump has refused to release his tax returns. Trump is the first president in four decades not to do so. Trump said that while wealthy, \"well-connected\" people could \"call me all they want, it's not going to help,\" saying he was \"doing the right thing.\" The President's tax reform framework proposes cutting the top income tax bracket from 39.5% to 35%, though the plan gives congressional committees latitude to create a fourth, higher income tax bracket. While Trump claimed parts of his tax proposal would hurt his wallet, he seemed sure the plan would bolster his popularity. \"What is good for me, not only as President and legacy, what is good for me is if everything takes off like a rocket ship,\" Trump said. \"Like it should have for 20 years. That's good for me. That's good for everyone. And that's what I think is going to happen. And a lot of very wealthy people feel the same way, believe me.\" Still, while the President focused on the benefits the tax proposal would deliver to middle class Americans, he made clear it would also be a boon for big business. Beyond slashing the corporate tax rate to \"no higher than 20%,\" Trump's proposal also offers write-offs for companies that move their manufacturing plants to the US and would incentivize the repatriation of \"trillions\" of dollars in US companies' profits stashed in tax havens overseas. \"Our framework will stop punishing companies for keeping their headquarters in the United States. We're punishing companies under our codes for being in the United States,\" Trump said. \"When our companies move to other countries it's our loyal American workers who get hurt.\" Trump said his business-friendly policies would lead to increased wages and economic gains in the US. The GOP framework would also cap the tax rate for small businesses at 25%, Trump said. The framework is the result of months of closed-door discussions between top Trump administration officials and Republican congressional leaders, but Trump has signaled in recent weeks that he is hoping to win some Democratic support for his proposal. Trump's trek to Indiana on Wednesday was the third time he has pitched tax reform in a red state that is home to a vulnerable Democratic senator, this time Sen. Joe Donnelly, who joined Trump for the speech. JUST WATCHED Trump: I'm very good at cutting taxes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nTrump: I'm very good at cutting taxes 01:09 Trump took the opportunity to turn up the heat on Donnelly, who is up for reelection in 2018, warning him to support tax reform, or else. \"If Sen. Donnelly doesn't approve it -- because you know he's on the other side -- we will come here, we will campaign against him like you wouldn't believe,\" Trump said, pointing at Donnelly in the audience before suddenly offering a wide grin. \"I think they're going to approve it, I think we'll have, actually I think we'll have numerous Democrats come across, because it's the right thing to do.\" Trump added that \"tax reform has not historically been a bipartisan issue,\" drawing on the example of the Reagan tax cuts which were passed with significant Democratic support as he said he hoped Democrats would join in supporting the reform effort. Trump drew on the stories of ordinary Americans as he made his pitch, referring to a seventh-generation farmer to call for a repeal of the estate tax, drawing on the story of a small business owner as he calls for tax cuts and pulling from the experiences of an IT worker whom Trump said has seen firsthand the damage of the US' high corporate tax rate. The GOP proposal, being presented jointly by the White House, House Ways & Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee, calls for reducing income tax rates to three brackets of 12%, 25% and 35%, but leaves the income ranges for those brackets up to tax committees, according to a copy of the Republican framework obtained by CNN. The proposal also gives committees the flexibility to create a fourth bracket that could potentially eliminate a potential tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. The proposals also calls for doubling the standard deduction to $24,000 for married couples and $12,000 for single filers. The framework also calls for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20%, though Trump has for months said he would like to see the 35% rate brought down to 15%. Trump sought to justify the shift on Wednesday, saying that he only floated 15% as a negotiating tactic. \"I wanted to start at 15 to get there,\" Trump said.

You do by Matt Egan @mattmegan5 September 27, 2017: 2:35 PM ET Mayor: Don't put debt above people Looming in the background of Puerto Rico's humanitarian crisis is a mountain of debt. Long before Hurricane Maria left millions on the island without power or water, Puerto Rico was battling a financial crisis years in the making. Puerto Rico's crippling debt load -- totaling $73 billion -- forced the island to file in May for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history. President Trump pointed out Puerto Rico's \"massive debt\" problems on Monday. Puerto Rico, Trump tweeted, owes \"billions of dollars\" to \"Wall Street and the banks, which, sadly, must be dealt with.\" \nIn reality, most of that money is owed to everyday investors . Less than 25% of Puerto Rican debt is held by hedge funds, according to estimates by Cate Long, founder of research firm Puerto Rico Clearinghouse. \nThe rest of the debt is owned by individuals and mutual funds that are held by mom-and-pop investors. \n\"For the most part, Main Street America owns this debt,\" Long said. \"It's not as though these are vultures circling around the island.\" \nInvestors piled into Puerto Rican bonds over the last decade, enabling the island's unsustainable spending-spree along the way. They kept buying Puerto Rican debt even as the island fell into an 11-year recession that deepened the debt crisis. High unemployment forced hundreds of thousands of residents to flee the island, further eroding the tax base. \nThese risks forced Puerto Rico to pay high rates that lured bond investors searching for healthy returns in a world of historically-low interest rates. Another bonus: Puerto Rico's debt is \"triple tax-exempt.\" That means owners of the bonds don't face federal, state or local taxes on the interest they earn. \nMore than 850 bond mutual funds own Puerto Rican debt, according to data compiled by Morningstar. Some of the biggest holders include mutual funds run by household names like OppenheimerFunds, Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs ( GS ) , BlackRock ( BLK ) and T. Rowe Price. \nRelated: Who will help Puerto Rico? \nHedge funds own billions in debt \nHedge funds that few Americans have ever heard of are also on the hook for billions in Puerto Rican debt. \nFor instance, Autonomy Capital, a New York hedge fund run by former Lehman Brothers banker Robert Gibbins, owns nearly $1 billion of Puerto Rican general obligation bonds, according to court documents filed this summer. \nFCO Advisors, a hedge fund run by former Goldman Sachs municipal banker Hector Negroni, is sitting on more than $400 million of Puerto Rican bonds as well. \nAnother key player: Aurelius Capital Management, a New York hedge fund that lists nearly $500 million in Puerto Rican bonds. Aurelius, run by Mark Brodsky, won big by playing hardball with Argentina for years following that country's default. \n'Maddening process' \nUp until now, Puerto Rico's messy battle with its bondholders has played out in court, with dozens of cases being fought by parties that often have competing interests. \nThis \"maddening process\" makes it \"so bloody hard to get any kind of resolution,\" said John Rousseau, director of fixed income at Cumberland Advisors. The Florida firm manages about $150 million of insured Puerto Rican bonds owned by individuals. \nThe devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria has shined a bright light on this glacial process that threatens to complicate the island's recovery efforts by cutting the territory off from borrowing money for years. \nThere is hope that Hurricane Maria -- and the federal attention it requires -- could be the catalyst to break the logjam. \nLong said that the tweets from Trump, who has ample bankruptcy experience himself, may signal he's willing to bring the various parties to the bargaining table to reach a deal. \n\"Puerto Rico cannot go forward with all of this litigation hanging over it,\" Long said. \nOf course, reaching a deal to renegotiate Puerto Rico's debt means that bondholders will have to take losses, known as \"haircuts.\" Bondholders, most of whom haven't been paid for over a year, have long realized there will be losses. \nSome have already agreed to take them. PREPA, the island's electric utility, filed for bankruptcy in July after Puerto Rico's oversight board rejected a restructuring agreement with bondholders. \nHow much federal aid will Puerto Rico get? \nPuerto Rico's debt crisis may also be eased by Washington. \nDuring the campaign, Trump vowed not to bail out Puerto Rico. However, it's clear that Puerto Rico, which is a U.S. territory, needs federal disaster aid. \nSome of the $15 billion Congress approved for hurricane relief after Harvey hit will be used for Puerto Rico. The White House is expected to send another request for disaster spending in mid-October. \n\"It's the federal government's job to step in and get Puerto Rico rebuilt,\" said Rousseau. \nHe called for something like the Marshall Plan, the massive federal aid provided by the U.S. to rebuild Western Europe after World War II. \n\"Think of Maria as a bomb. The difference is this is our country, not someone else's,\" he said. \nFederal aid won't erase Puerto Rico's mountain of debt.

But in 2011 Facebook went to federal regulators to get an exception from a rule that would have forced it to do the same thing. Federal election regulations state that political \"communications placed for a fee on another person's website\" must carry disclaimers stating that they are advertisements and who paid for them. Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ) sought an exception to disclaimer regulations citing space constraints for its \"character-limited ads.\" Lawyers for the company argued the ads were so small that a disclaimer would be impracticable, according to Federal Election Commission records reviewed by CNN. \nFacebook argued, at the time, that ads on the platform were restricted to 160 characters. However, ads on Facebook have since evolved into sophisticated multimedia experiences. Advertisers can choose to sponsor videos, carousels of images and slideshows. Today, not all of Facebook's advertising options are character-limited. \nFacebook asked for what is known as a \"small items\" exception. The FEC says small campaign paraphernalia like stickers and buttons do not need to carry disclaimers stating who paid for them. \nThe FEC also allows some political ads to avoid disclaimer rules where it would be impracticable -- the commission lists skywriting as an exception under this clause, for instance. \nRelated: Russian-bought Facebook ads sought to amplify political divisions \nThere was some precedent for Facebook's request. \nIn 2002, the FEC ruled in favor of Target Wireless, which argued that political ads sent by text message that were limited to 160 characters should not have to include a disclaimer. \nIn 2010, the commission ruled in favor of Google when it sought an exception for political ads on its platform, again arguing that such ads were character-limited. \nThe FEC, which is made up of six commissioners, normally split along partisan lines, voted in favor of the exception as Google ( GOOG ) had outlined in its request. Google said that the URL of the group paying for the ad would appear in the ad and that a full disclaimer would appear on the landing page once people clicked on the ad. \nThe FEC also invited other digital companies to seek similar advisory opinions. \nThe next year, represented by a legal team that included Marc Elias, a veteran campaign finance lawyer who was general counsel to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, Facebook asked for an exception that was less restrictive than Google's. (Elias was also part of the legal team that had represented Google in 2010.) \nCNN has reached out to Elias for comment. \nRelated: Russia threatens to block Facebook Why was it so easy for the Russians to buy ads on Facebook? \nFacebook did not make any assurances on URLs or landing pages, instead requesting an outright exception -- no strings attached \u2014 that the Republicans on the commission had suggested could be possible when they considered Google's request. \nThe FEC's commissioners split 3-3 on Facebook's request and failed to issue an opinion. \nWhen it comes to the FEC, though, indecision can be as important as a decision. For groups seeking exceptions, a deadlocked FEC is effectively an exception by proxy, Ann Ravel, a former FEC commissioner appointed by President Obama, told CNN. \n\"If a request for an exception splits 3-3 -- that is, if it does not get the four votes required for action, sophisticated lawyers in DC know that enforcement won't be brought against them because the three commissioners who voted for the exception will vote against enforcement,\" Ravel said. \nWith the tie vote in hand, Facebook proceeded with allowing political advertisements to be placed on its platform without disclaimers. \nTrevor Potter, a former Republican FEC chairman who is now president of the Campaign Legal Center, a group that advocates for campaign finance law reform, said in a statement after Zuckerberg's announcement that Facebook had \"pressured the FEC not to extend existing disclaimer requirements to online political ads, which helped create the secrecy that gave rise to foreign interference in the 2016 elections.\" \nRelated: I won't stop trying to expose fake Russia-linked Facebook ads, Mark Warner says \nZuckerberg's announcement came after Facebook revealed that it had sold $100,000 in ads to a Russian troll farm in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election. \nLawrence Noble, a former FEC general counsel who is now also with the Campaign Legal Center and a CNN contributor, said that under the existing law, the onus is ultimately on campaigns, not the social media platforms, to ensure digital ads comply with federal disclaimer rules. \nNoble said Facebook and Google likely sought exceptions \"because they want to be able to sell these ads. If the FEC required something that the platforms didn't make available to advertisers, then they wouldn't be able to place the ad.\" \n\"However you would hope that the platform would facilitate any disclaimer requirements and would want people to know about the regulations as they placed an ad,\" he said. \nZuckerberg said on Thursday that political ads on Facebook will carry a disclaimer in the future. However, he didn't say how Facebook will define what is and is not a political ad, and Facebook has not elaborated further on that question. \nRavel suspects that Zuckerberg was referring only to ads bought by campaigns and PACs. \n\"We know that there is a whole universe of other activity that are actually political ads masqueraded as something else that I don't think Facebook is going to deal with,\" she said, referring to the fact that any Facebook user can set up a page and begin promoting content that is not explicitly a political ad, but is related to politics nonetheless, such as a news article or video about a candidate that does not explicitly encourage a vote for or against them. Warner: We need to make Russia-linked ads public \nRelated: Trump says this is all a hoax. Mueller, Congress and Facebook disagree \nRavel also said she believes Facebook should be made to keep a record of and disclose political spending on its platform. \nLast week, two Democratic senators, Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner, sent a letter seeking co-sponsors for a bill that would require platforms like Facebook to keep a public record of all electioneering communications purchased by a person or group that spends more than $10,000. \nAn ad-buyer could reach up to almost 4 million Americans in 24 hours by spending $9,999, according to estimates on Facebook's ad platform reviewed by CNN. \nA Facebook spokesman pointed CNN to Zuckerberg's statement last week, and declined to elaborate further.
