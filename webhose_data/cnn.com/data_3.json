Cincinnati Councilman Charlie Winburn, who also spoke at the news conference, has requested a transfer of police personnel within 30 days. \"This has been going on and on and on,\" said Winburn. \"Close this place down -- close this place down now.\" Pesticides and possible contamination Anyone who visits the building at 1012 Ludlow Avenue, which is nicknamed \"the three bedroom ranch,\" can see the problems for themselves, said Hils. \"The first problem is it just isn't big enough to house the folks and the records and all the things that we have there, which then makes it impossible to clean,\" said Hils. Because of this crowding, he said, the building has had \"half a dozen, at least\" bed bug infestations over the past year or so. Malibu teachers say school is making them sick \"They're constantly throwing pesticides in here,\" he said. High power lines run over the building, which sits next to an expressway that is itself beside Mill creek \"which has been known as a toxic place for many, many years,\" said Hils. Though named \"the most endangered urban river in North America\" in 1997, Mill creek has shown improved water quality in recent years, according to American Rivers , a national river conservation organization. Add to that, there is asbestos on the boiler and there was a target range in the basement of the building up until the 1970s, \"so lead contaminants are a possibility there,\" Hils said. Specifying that he does not have a Ph.D., he said \"common sense\" indicates something is wrong at the District 5 building. \"It's like a cocktail,\" said Hils, who raised this issue within the police department beginning in November last year. Spokesman Saunders confirmed that testing of the building had been done and \"the results did not show anything significant that would contribute to cancer or any other serious health issues.\" \"Even though they can't point to one thing that's making people sick,\" said Hils, an \"inordinate amount of officers\" have become sick with cancer and at this point he just wants people out of the building. City government, though, has been slow to act, likely because there's no \"one thing.\" Building is 'not ideal' In a January 25, 2017 memo to the mayor and city council, Harry Black, city manager, acknowledged that the administration was continuing to examine the building and investigate concerns. \"Thus far, a series of internal and external inspections and tests have indicated the building is in good condition from an environmental perspective,\" wrote Black. \"However it is not ideal in the long term primarily due to the lack of space.\" Black noted that the District 5 building was erected in 1957 and \"was never intended as a permanent facility.\" \"It was built as a temporary headquarters required as a result of the Mill Creek Expressway construction,\" Black wrote of the building. Hils said 122 police department employees are assigned to the building, though the majority are street officers who spend very little time there. \"Somewhere in the range of 30\" people, investigators and administrative officers, sit at their desks most of the day \"making phone calls, doing computer searches things like that,\" said Hils. \"It's the investigative unit where you will find a lot of those cancers,\" said Hils. In an email to the mayor and city council in February, Black referenced their discussion of a temporary relocation of \"all or a portion\" of District 5 headquarters staff. \"Please do whatever you think makes the most sense,\" said Black at that time and offered his assistance with this matter. Winburn said \"this issue has been going on forever\" and the administration was \"stonewalling this situation.\" Mentioning the fact that his wife suffered from cancer, the city councilman said the administration was \"callus to this, they are not sensitive to what is going on here.\" \"This is a disgrace,\" he said. Cancer cluster defined To be considered a cancer cluster , a group of cancer cases must meet various criteria, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. First, the number of cases must be higher than typically observed in a similar setting -- in a group with similar population, age, race, or gender. \"All of the cases must involve the same type of cancer, or types of cancer scientifically proven to have the same cause,\" the CDC website reads. Additionally, the time period and geographic area must be carefully defined when calculating both the number of cases in a suspected cluster and the number of expected cases in a comparison group. \"It is possible to \"create\" or \"obscure\" a cluster by selection of a specific area,\" reads the website. The National Cancer Institute maintains that most suspected cancer clusters turn out, on detailed investigation, not to be \"true cancer clusters... no cause can be identified, and the clustering of cases turns out to be a random occurrence.\" 'Sworn to uphold their duty' Though many of District 5 staff have been diagnosed with cancer, Hils said, to get his point across he prefers to discuss just the six officers who died between 2015 and 2016. \"Stephanie Bradford was an investigator here for 18 years,\" said Hils, noting the 50-year-old died of appendix cancer. Colon cancer deaths rise among younger adults, and no one knows why \"Darrell Chapman was in the neighborhood unit, had a lot of desk duty time and everything,\" said Hils. This 59-year-old died of some sort of gastrointestinal cancer, said Hils, just like Jana Cruise, who performed a good deal of desk duty, and passed in her early 50s. Robert McGuire, 50, \"loved working the desk\" and died of colon cancer, said Hils, while Anthony Wagers, 53, died of a rare stomach cancer following years of administrative duty in District 5. Ingrid Weber, 51, died of lymphoma following her stint in the investigative unit. \"Almost all of them had [gastrointestinal] types of cancer,\" said Hils, who said he reported this cluster to the Cincinnati Department of Health. \"I've talked to everyone who would listen,\" said Hils, who is clearly disappointed in the lack of response. The department of health did not return a request to comment from CNN. \"I wanted to press the button and get them out of here,\" said Hils. A recent diagnosis of cancer in another officer \"made me regret that I backed off,\" he said. \"I want that to be their Christmas present -- to have another place to go.\" Asked whether police officers might strike if his demands are not met, Hils said \"the men and women are sworn to uphold their duty.

Steve Israel, a Democrat from New York, is a political novelist and CNN contributor. His next book, \"Big Guns,\" will be released in April. This piece is one in a series of columns for CNN Opinion on life after Congress. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author. (CNN) It's not repeal and replace, it's rewind. No matter what the outcome of Republican efforts to trash Obamacare, every day of the 2018 midterm election is looking eerily for them like 2010 did for Democrats. Even now, I still have traumatic flashbacks to that electoral tsunami. Steve Israel At about this point in the 2010 midterm election cycle, Democrats had a confident grip on our majority. Sure, we sensed the headwinds against us. We recognized the strength of the Tea Party, signaling an early gathering of energy for our opponents. We even knew we'd lose seats. Yet our 39-vote margin seemed strong enough to retain the gavel -- maybe not a two-fisted hold, but just enough to keep it in our calloused fingers. Then there was the debate on Obamacare. We were caught somewhere on the political map between doom and dread. If we didn't pass the bill, our base would abandon us in the midterms, dampening voter turnout. If we passed it, swing voters in our most competitive districts would abandon us and vote for Republicans. Either would increase our losses. Read More President Obama's approval was, at this point, comfortably over 50% and slid to the mid-40s by the midterms. President Trump's current approval is at 40% and even a strong and improbable rebound gets him no higher than Obama's worst numbers. I remember the faces of some of my colleagues as the vote on Obamacare neared. In caucus meetings, we listened to passionate (and now familiar) arguments about keeping our campaign promises and passing the bill. Democrats who had won historically Republican districts came to the floor as if en route to their political funerals. Some were enraged that their progressive colleagues didn't understand the backlash they were getting back home. Others came to the floor with glints of defiance and girded for battle in the upcoming elections, knowing that passing the bill was the right thing to do. Single payer is the fight Democrats have been waiting for On March 21, the House passed the Senate's Obamacare bill by a 219-212 vote in the House (the Senate's bill had passed on Christmas Eve with a filibuster-proof 60-39 majority). President Obama signed the bill into law two days later. In the ensuing midterms, we lost 63 seats and our majority in the House; we held our Senate majority despite losing six seats. A study by researchers at the University of Denver and North Carolina State University on the impact of the healthcare vote and other legislation singled out 13 seats we lost because of Obamacare, and found that it was the leading reason that House Democrats had been defeated. Recently, I spoke with former Rep. Baron Hill, an Indiana Democrat. I asked whether he sensed that he might lose his seat when he voted for Obamacare. \"We are elected to lead,\" he told me. \"The ACA was and is good for people in Indiana as well for the country. Republicans successfully demonized it for political reasons. But if we are really sincere about doing what's best for the people we represent, especially on an issue as big as ACA, politics needs to be shelved and leadership needs to prevail.\" I've never believed that Obamacare alone was responsible for Baron Hill's defeat, or for the loss of 62 other seats to Republicans in 2010. But it was the tip of the spear. The economy was still reeling from the 2008 meltdown. The middle class felt betrayed and insecure. The Citizens United decision flooded competitive districts with dark money ads from K Street. Follow CNN Opinion \nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook There is one difference between the 2010 races and 2018 (so far). Republicans have outflanked Democrats by taking control of redistricting and fortifying their incumbents. But by every other measure, Republicans looking at 2018 should see shades of 2010. The middle class still feels uncertain. The President is historically unpopular. Democrats have the momentum. And as Senate and House Republicans keep discovering with false starts at repeal bills, passing something that has the support of a measly 33% of Americans may be like tying a rodeo rope around their bucking base, but it's also likely to send many voters in search of another horse. Which means Republicans in Congress should brace themselves.

Rise for some, fall for others Using routine annual surveillance data from 31 countries, reported to the European Surveillance System between 2004 and 2015, the team at the ECDC analyzed new HIV diagnoses among people aged 15 and above. The rate of HIV diagnosis among people over 50 increased in 16 countries, including Germany, Ireland and Belgium, and decreased in just one country, Portugal. Rates were highest in Estonia, Latvia and Malta, where more than seven new cases were diagnosed per 100,000 older people by 2015. Numbers also increased among younger people in these countries, aged 15 to 49 years. In certain countries, however, such as the United Kingdom and Norway, new diagnoses went down among young people, but increased in the over-50 population, with more than a 3.6% increase in newly diagnosed HIV cases each year in both of these nations. \"This is a result of successful awareness campaigns that may not have targeted older adults enough,\" Tavoschi said, speculating on one reason behind the trend. England has a national HIV prevention program in place, for example, using local activities and social marketing to promote national HIV testing weeks and a campaign called \"It starts with me\" to increase testing and condom use, reduce stigma and inform people about sexually transmitted infections and practicing safe sex.

Among all age groups, 47% of people analyzed were diagnosed late, but when divided out by age, 63% of people older than 50 were delayed in going to their clinic to be diagnosed, compared to 43% among those younger than 50. \"Being HIV positive and not knowing may endanger other people by transmitting the disease unknowingly,\" said Tavoschi, adding that some studies have also shown lower survivability among older people living with HIV.

Puerto Ricans fear their future San Jorge Children's Hospital is the largest private children's medical center in the Caribbean. Read More Before Hurricane Maria hit the island, the children's hospital had about 90 patients, according to Cruz Vivaldi. They discharged 30 who were in stable condition and are currently treating 60 who need to remain hospitalized. \"Right now, we only have diesel for today and tomorrow. We're already working on refueling our tanks so we can extend our power generating capability, which is at 50% right now,\" Cruz Vivaldi said Tuesday. Lack of power and water has severely weakened the ability to treat patients at dozens of hospitals around the island. CNN visited a local clinic in Yabucoa, a coastal community on the island's southeast, that was hit by the eye of the hurricane. A local official said the clinic is not currently operational. Medical personnel are sending patients to the nearest medical facility, located in the nearby city of Caguas. An unfolding medical crisis The death toll from Hurricane Maria currently stands at 16. Authorities have not released information about the number of people who were injured during and after the hurricane. A medical crisis is unfolding around the island. Many people hurt during the hurricane have yet to be treated. The lack of power puts dialysis patients at risk, and diabetes patients may lose their insulin supply for lack of refrigeration. Dr. Israel Ayala Oliveras, medical director at the Puerto Rico Medical Center, said people are showing up there with all kinds of injuries related to the hurricane. \"We're treating lacerations, concussions, deep cut wounds and others caused by flying objects. People have also gotten hurt by falling around their homes or when using or operating chainsaws and machetes as they try to clear access to their homes,\" Ayala said.

Sergeant Dan Hils, who spoke on the steps of the headquarters Tuesday morning, called on the city's mayor and council members to relocate police officers working at the District 5 headquarters building before Christmas with a deadline of October 30 to put a plan into place. \n\"A number of officers started to talk to me about an unusual number of cancer deaths here in District 5,\" said Hils, who became union president in 2015 and has been with the Cincinnati Police Department since 1987. Cancer down nationwide, but 'hot spots' persist \"In two years, from 2015 to 2016, six officers died and they were all under the age of 60, most of them right around the age of 50, and all of them had worked in District 5,\" Hils told CNN before he addressed reporters at his news conference . All six officers had worked in jobs requiring a lot of time in the office and \"many had spent large portions of their careers here,\" he said. \"Those six people all lived very clean lives and were still young,\" said Hils. He added there are a number of \"living cancer cases\" among others who spent significant time in the District 5 building, but he would not release the names for \"privacy reasons.\" Hils said the police department has five districts yet none of the other four districts has a comparable number of cancer cases. JUST WATCHED Cancer: The facts Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nCancer: The facts 01:00 Read More \"The Police Department and other City Departments are in the process of assessing temporary locations on a leased basis and are working toward a long-term solution as well,\" said Steve Saunders, a spokesman with Cincinnati Police Department, on behalf of Police Chief Eliot Isaac. Cincinnati Councilman Charlie Winburn, who also spoke at the news conference, has requested a transfer of police personnel within 30 days. \"This has been going on and on and on,\" said Winburn. \"Close this place down -- close this place down now.\" Pesticides and possible contamination Anyone who visits the building at 1012 Ludlow Avenue, which is nicknamed \"the three bedroom ranch,\" can see the problems for themselves, said Hils. \"The first problem is it just isn't big enough to house the folks and the records and all the things that we have there, which then makes it impossible to clean,\" said Hils. Because of this crowding, he said, the building has had \"half a dozen, at least\" bed bug infestations over the past year or so. Malibu teachers say school is making them sick \"They're constantly throwing pesticides in here,\" he said. High power lines run over the building, which sits next to an expressway that is itself beside Mill creek \"which has been known as a toxic place for many, many years,\" said Hils. Though named \"the most endangered urban river in North America\" in 1997, Mill creek has shown improved water quality in recent years, according to American Rivers , a national river conservation organization. Add to that, there is asbestos on the boiler and there was a target range in the basement of the building up until the 1970s, \"so lead contaminants are a possibility there,\" Hils said. Specifying that he does not have a Ph.D., he said \"common sense\" indicates something is wrong at the District 5 building. \"It's like a cocktail,\" said Hils, who raised this issue within the police department beginning in November last year. Spokesman Saunders confirmed that testing of the building had been done and \"the results did not show anything significant that would contribute to cancer or any other serious health issues.\" \"Even though they can't point to one thing that's making people sick,\" said Hils, an \"inordinate amount of officers\" have become sick with cancer and at this point he just wants people out of the building. City government, though, has been slow to act, likely because there's no \"one thing.\" Building is 'not ideal' In a January 25, 2017 memo to the mayor and city council, Harry Black, city manager, acknowledged that the administration was continuing to examine the building and investigate concerns. \"Thus far, a series of internal and external inspections and tests have indicated the building is in good condition from an environmental perspective,\" wrote Black. \"However it is not ideal in the long term primarily due to the lack of space.\" Black noted that the District 5 building was erected in 1957 and \"was never intended as a permanent facility.\" \"It was built as a temporary headquarters required as a result of the Mill Creek Expressway construction,\" Black wrote of the building. Hils said 122 police department employees are assigned to the building, though the majority are street officers who spend very little time there. \"Somewhere in the range of 30\" people, investigators and administrative officers, sit at their desks most of the day \"making phone calls, doing computer searches things like that,\" said Hils. \"It's the investigative unit where you will find a lot of those cancers,\" said Hils. In an email to the mayor and city council in February, Black referenced their discussion of a temporary relocation of \"all or a portion\" of District 5 headquarters staff. \"Please do whatever you think makes the most sense,\" said Black at that time and offered his assistance with this matter. Winburn said \"this issue has been going on forever\" and the administration was \"stonewalling this situation.\" Mentioning the fact that his wife suffered from cancer, the city councilman said the administration was \"callus to this, they are not sensitive to what is going on here.\" \"This is a disgrace,\" he said. Cancer cluster defined To be considered a cancer cluster , a group of cancer cases must meet various criteria, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. First, the number of cases must be higher than typically observed in a similar setting -- in a group with similar population, age, race, or gender. \"All of the cases must involve the same type of cancer, or types of cancer scientifically proven to have the same cause,\" the CDC website reads. Additionally, the time period and geographic area must be carefully defined when calculating both the number of cases in a suspected cluster and the number of expected cases in a comparison group. \"It is possible to \"create\" or \"obscure\" a cluster by selection of a specific area,\" reads the website. The National Cancer Institute maintains that most suspected cancer clusters turn out, on detailed investigation, not to be \"true cancer clusters... no cause can be identified, and the clustering of cases turns out to be a random occurrence.\" 'Sworn to uphold their duty' Though many of District 5 staff have been diagnosed with cancer, Hils said, to get his point across he prefers to discuss just the six officers who died between 2015 and 2016. \"Stephanie Bradford was an investigator here for 18 years,\" said Hils, noting the 50-year-old died of appendix cancer. Colon cancer deaths rise among younger adults, and no one knows why \"Darrell Chapman was in the neighborhood unit, had a lot of desk duty time and everything,\" said Hils. This 59-year-old died of some sort of gastrointestinal cancer, said Hils, just like Jana Cruise, who performed a good deal of desk duty, and passed in her early 50s. Robert McGuire, 50, \"loved working the desk\" and died of colon cancer, said Hils, while Anthony Wagers, 53, died of a rare stomach cancer following years of administrative duty in District 5. Ingrid Weber, 51, died of lymphoma following her stint in the investigative unit. \"Almost all of them had [gastrointestinal] types of cancer,\" said Hils, who said he reported this cluster to the Cincinnati Department of Health. \"I've talked to everyone who would listen,\" said Hils, who is clearly disappointed in the lack of response. The department of health did not return a request to comment from CNN. \"I wanted to press the button and get them out of here,\" said Hils. A recent diagnosis of cancer in another officer \"made me regret that I backed off,\" he said. \"I want that to be their Christmas present -- to have another place to go.\" Asked whether police officers might strike if his demands are not met, Hils said \"the men and women are sworn to uphold their duty. They're not allowed to take those actions.\" Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter .\nWith a mayoral election in November, the timing may appear political, said Hils, but it's more a matter of family members reaching out to him and asking him to resolve this situation. \"Do politics really matter right now?\" said Hils. \"There's elections -- and then there's life and death.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anthony wagers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve saunders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jana cruise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hils", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saunders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "black", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darrell chapman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie bradford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan hils", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie winburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry black", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mcguire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eliot isaac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ingrid weber", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "police department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cincinnati police department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn health on facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national cancer institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cincinnati department of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american rivers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cincinnati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ludlow avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malibu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T02:05:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "407b5fdcfab10335dbe33e5a72666c319a6c173d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsQVDBKSNTbJ0MAPmkKZma_87UeMotPh93A0GKpMd1q7otoycT29GqsPxXgl.O0k1NeVk3N4jbm8CzucMrU3h8jg--", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss&submit=Read", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - Health", "title": "Hospitalized children at risk in Puerto Rico due to lack of fuel", "title_full": "Hospitalized children at risk in Puerto Rico due to lack of fuel", "published": "2017-09-27T01:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926130132-puerto-rico-damaged-road-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 8793, "comments": 0, "shares": 8793}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "407b5fdcfab10335dbe33e5a72666c319a6c173d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsQVDBKSNTbJ0MAPmkKZma_87UeMotPh93A0GKpMd1q7otoycT29GqsPxXgl.O0k1NeVk3N4jbm8CzucMrU3h8jg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T01:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Hospitalized children at risk in Puerto Rico due to lack of fuel", "text": "Story highlights Hospitals are struggling to treat patients at dozens of Puerto Rico hospitals Children's hospital has 12 patients on ventilators and limited fuel for generators NEW: US Army delivered three-day fuel supply San Juan, Puerto Rico (CNN) The US Army has delivered a three-day supply of fuel to a San Juan, Puerto Rico, children's hospital where patients were in danger due a diesel shortage.\nThe lives of 12 pediatric patients at San Jorge Children's Hospital were at risk after extensive damage to the US island territory's fuel supply infrastructure, a hospital administrator said Tuesday.

The initial ruling by the International Trade Commission, an arm of the Commerce Department, recommends a 219.63% tariff on the delivery of each airliner. Boeing ( BA ) , America's largest exporter and sole producer of commercial airliners, is suing Bombardier. At issue is whether the plane maker received financial backing from the Canadian government that allowed it to stay afloat and sell to Delta for what Boeing alleges were \"absurdly low prices.\" \n\"The U.S. values its relationships with Canada, but even our closest allies must play by the rules,\" said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a statement. \"The subsidization of goods by foreign governments is something that the Trump Administration takes very seriously, and we will continue to evaluate and verify the accuracy of this preliminary determination.\" \nThe ruling announced Tuesday is the first of two in the case. The second is expected on as early as Oct. 5 and may add even more to Bombardier's tariff penalty . \nRelated: This plane may vastly improve flying in the U.S., if it doesn't first start a trade war \nThe dispute stems from a 2016 Delta order from the Montreal-based air and rail giant for as many as 125 C Series aircraft. Boeing alleges government support helped its Canadian rival establish the all-new airliner at the expense of Boeing's own 737 jets. \nBoeing claims that Bombardier is selling each C Series jet to Delta for $19.6 million. That's not accurate, said Delta. \nThe jet's list price is nearly $80 million, but steep discounts are common. \nBoeing had recommended a heavy tariff on the C Series, paid by Delta or any U.S. airline importing the aircraft in what would be considered a major blow to Bombardier and its ability to establish the new jet in the world's largest aviation market. The preliminary decision by the trade commission for a 219.63% tariff was steeper than the 160% recommended by Boeing. \nBombardier reacted to the decision, saying: \"We strongly disagree with the Commerce Department's preliminary decision. The magnitude of the proposed duty is absurd and divorced from the reality about the financing of multi-billion dollar aircraft programs.\" \nRelated: Is Trump trying to start a trade war with Canada? \nBoeing in a statement hailed the result, saying, \"This dispute has nothing to do with limiting innovation or competition, which we welcome. Rather, it has everything to do with maintaining a level playing field and ensuring that aerospace companies abide by trade agreements.\" \nThe dispute has drawn in the leaders of Canada and the United Kingdom and now threatens to shoot down a $5.2 billion Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter deal with the Royal Canadian Air Force if the case isn't dropped or settled. \n\"We won't do business with a company that's busy trying to sue us and put our aerospace workers out of business,\" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said earlier this month. Bombardier's aerospace division employs 28,500 worldwide, including 4,000 in Northern Ireland where the jet's wings are manufactured. \nRelated: Justin Trudeau warns Boeing over trade dispute \nChrystia Freeland, Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister, said: \"While this is only a preliminary stage in the investigation, and no duties can be imposed until the final investigations are completed, Canada strongly disagrees with the anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations into imports of Canadian large civil aircraft. This is clearly aimed at eliminating Bombardier's C Series aircraft from the U.S. market.\" \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May had also sought to intervene in the dispute, asking President Trump to help protect jobs in Northesrn Ireland. \n\"Bitterly disappointed by initial Bombardier ruling,\" May tweeted on Wednesday. \"The government will continue to work with the company to protect vital jobs for Northern Ireland.\" \nThe Canadian government said the complaint was just as likely to threaten U.S. jobs as those in Canada and Northern Ireland. Freeland said the C Series jet supports an estimated 23,000 jobs in the U.S, including those in Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey, Washington, New York, Ohio, Kansas, Pennsylvania and Colorado. \nThe jet's advanced engines are manufactured in the U.S. by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, which supplies many parts of the jet. \nAs a result, Bombardier had drawn the public support of members of Congress and elected officials and even U.S. airlines like JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines who wanted to expand the range of options for commercial airliners beyond Boeing and its European rival Airbus. \nThe steep tariff, which is far in excess of the 160% Boeing had requested, amounts to making Delta pay the roughly $5.6 billion list price for the 75 jets it has on firm order. In the airline industry, commercial buyers do not pay list price and typically command steep discounts of 40% to 60%. Each CS100 jet has a list price of nearly $80 million. \nBombardier also maintains that the smallest single-aisle 737 does not compete with the CS100, the roughly 110-seat Bombardier model purchased by Delta. During the 2016 competition, Boeing offered Delta, the second largest U.S. airline, used jets from another manufacturer. \nDelta ( DAL ) , which will use the jet on short and medium range flights around the U.S., cautioned that the ITC's decision was preliminary. \n\"We are confident the USITC will conclude that no U.S. manufacturer is at risk because neither Boeing nor any other U.S. manufacturer makes any 100-110 seat aircraft that competes with the CS100.\" CNNMoney (Seattle) First published September 26, 2017: 6:41 PM ET ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jon ostrower @jonostrower", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "justin trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bombardier", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "commerce dept.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "commerce department", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boeing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boeing f/a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "itc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal canadian air force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international trade commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. commerce department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T02:08:15.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0d1c869f54780da93cbefcc25a697114565f678f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsCRKyCcRdUN2zv6fStzAyIt8FmzSeP5eU6fRVzr7NKwaSLvw7tfBx2M_tKJdcpkd.", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Clock ticking down to O.J.

Hide Caption 23 of 23 (CNN) As the clock counts down to October 1, the first possible day O.J.

Brooke Keast, spokeswoman for the Nevada Department of Corrections, said Simpson will be transferred out of the Lovelock Correctional Center in northern Nevada to High Desert State Prison near Las Vegas. \"I'm headed to the High Desert State Prison on October 2, along with our deputy director of operations who makes the decisions on these matters,\" Keast said. \"October 1 is this Sunday and we don't release inmates to parole on weekends.\" \"I will get a short video of Simpson leaving and make it available to the media because we will not allow any media on prison property.\" Read More A source in Simpson's inner circle said the former football star will begin his life outside prison in southern Nevada. Parole board vote unanimous \"He's going to start in Las Vegas, but still intends to eventually move to Florida, the source said. \"Some things still need to be worked out with probation officials.\" What O.J. Simpson's life has been like in prison Simpson's children Sydney and Justin live on the west coast of Florida. The Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners voted unanimously to grant Simpson's release in July. The 70-year-old served nine years of a 33-year sentence for kidnapping and armed robbery in connection with a raid on memorabilia dealers in a Las Vegas Hotel room. Simpson has continually argued he orchestrated the caper to recover family mementos and memorabilia taken from him. \"I had no intent to commit a crime,\" Simpson testified in a cramped room at the medium security Lovelock facility. Simpson moved to single cell The Nevada Department of Corrections took extra measures to protect Simpson, just minutes after he was granted parole. Why we're still talking about O.J. Guards moved Simpson to a single cell away from the rest of the prison population. \"The last thing we want is some prisoner trying to make a name for himself by attacking Simpson,\" Keast said. Simpson will be driven to High Desert State Prison from Lovelock. \"We will take every precaution to be sure inmate Simpson will be transported safely,\" Keast said. \"It's a risky time, we put our staff and other inmates at risk whenever we transport a high-profile inmate. \"We never say when we are going to move somebody. \"Simpson will remain in protective custody at any of our facilities.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul vercammen", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "o.j. simpson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cochran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom scotto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o.j. simpson o.j. simpson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank gifford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "f. lee bailey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmelita durio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o.j. simpson simpson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooke keast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marguerite whitley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laraine newman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcia clark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronald goldman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simpson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garrett morris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arnelle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galanter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lou sabin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabriel grasso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe namath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicole brown simpson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o.j. simpson ronald goldman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnnie cochran jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lovelock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o.j. guards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o.j. simpson lead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnnie cochan jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "o.j. simpson as a university of southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o.j. simpson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york jets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yale galanter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oakland raiders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ford bronco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffalo bills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o.j. simpson disgraced", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada department of corrections", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada board of parole commissioners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o.j. simpson fans", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas hotel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lovelock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brentwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lovelock correctional center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "high desert state prison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T02:09:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df9cd84a1136f4a6ed01cbb01a17594f829008ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWF7rhGFbxMQRXvI9KOuVITs0k3uZLESIKTw.XWv0keEIje6YFj6j4XFwUo2Qs_V7yWOrzzRcBrO5A--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Democratic Sen.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Story highlights The White House has a strategy to target vulnerable Democratic senators President Donald Trump is making a push for tax reform on Wednesday (CNN) President Donald Trump will continue his outreach across the aisle Wednesday when he flies to Indiana with Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly aboard Air Force One. It's the second time this month that the President will travel with a Democrat up for re-election in a state that voted heavily for Trump. On September 6, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp hitched a ride to her home state of North Dakota, where Trump gave a speech on tax reform. Along with North Dakota, Trump gave a speech on tax reform in Missouri, home of Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, who's also up for re-election next year in a state that Trump won. Read More Trump plans travel to pressure vulnerable Democratic senators It's part of a White House strategy to target vulnerable Democrats who could help Republicans push through their tax reform plan. Trump's speech Wednesday comes the same day that Republicans are set to release some details of their plan . In a move that suggested he might be open to working with Republicans, Donnelly, along with two other Democrats in the Senate, didn't sign a letter by the party to Republican leadership with a list of demands on tax reform. Heitkamp and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- another vulnerable 2018 Democrat -- were the other two who didn't sign. \"It's an honor to welcome President Trump to Indiana, and I hope he has an opportunity to hear directly from Hoosiers on an issue that impacts not only our families but our economy,\" Donnelly said in a statement. \"I believe tax reform should include policies that will benefit working and middle class families, create new jobs, and protect existing jobs.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joe donnelly", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ashley killough", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "claire mccaskill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donnelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heitkamp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heidi heitkamp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe manchin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hoosiers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north dakota", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T02:15:35.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53dd9ef5a49e26963e3b4073e343838e3ed2e0ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsOz3JcsHheNaf3eDKpZcc7bWN7Fpf2SVHAthxVqbu_TdxavgKx9Qz4U.0U.3t_XWkS9JuiavZ9kJShdoKLJFeG9jFH9dEDc_fI6EIAHR2xEs-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - Politics", "title": "US military sends ships, aircraft to Puerto Rico", "title_full": "US military sends ships, aircraft to Puerto Rico", "published": "2017-09-27T02:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150618125334-usns-comfort-15-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 44192, "comments": 1, "shares": 44192}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 31}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "53dd9ef5a49e26963e3b4073e343838e3ed2e0ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsOz3JcsHheNaf3eDKpZcc7bWN7Fpf2SVHAthxVqbu_TdxavgKx9Qz4U.0U.3t_XWkS9JuiavZ9kJShdoKLJFeG9jFH9dEDc_fI6EIAHR2xEs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T02:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "US military sends ships, aircraft to Puerto Rico", "text": "Kids on ventilators in PR at risk amid no power 04:21 Story highlights The USS Kearsarge Amphibious Ready Group has already been conducting rescue operations in the region The US Air Force is also sending additional aircraft to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands Washington (CNN) The US military is planning to deploy the USNS Comfort hospital ship to assist with FEMA's response efforts in Puerto Rico a week after Hurricane Maria smashed the island as a Category 4 storm, several defense officials told CNN. The Comfort is a seagoing medical treatment facility \"capable of providing resuscitation and stabilization care; initial wound and basic surgery; and postoperative treatment,\" according to the US Navy. Puerto Rican officials asked for additional medical assistance from the ship after initially indicating that they wanted to focus on getting power restored to damaged hospitals on shore, US officials told CNN. CARIBBEAN SEA (April 10, 2015) Military Sealift Command (MSC) hospital ship USNS Comfort (T-AH 20) sits anchored off the coast of Belize for it's first mission stop during Continuing Promise 2015. While the Comfort is on the way, according to FEMA administrator Brock Long, it may not deploy for another week -- within five to nine days as additional forces are activated to help man the ship along with its current crew of about 18 civilian mariners. The crew is expected to grow to as many 60 and the medical crew could increase from the approximately 65 now with the ship to as many as 1,200, according to officials. Read More Hillary Clinton urged the Defense Department to send a Navy medical ship, while Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called for Republicans to join with Democrats to pass a robust relief package. Amid criticism, Trump ramps up Puerto Rico response The Navy hospital ship is just one part of the military's humanitarian assistance effort -- deploying assets to both Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands after the storm decimated critical infrastructure in the region. The USS Kearsarge Amphibious Ready Group has already been conducting rescue operations in the region, including eight medical evacuations and 148 airlifts, and delivered 44,177 pounds of relief supplies and cargo to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands since Maria struck, according to the Pentagon. The US Air Force is also sending additional aircraft to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to ramp up the volume of daily relief missions. Speaking on Capitol Hill Tuesday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Joseph Dunford said the priority is making sure airfields can operate. \"The responsibility is primarily DHS, but at this point we're not trapped in bureaucratic niceties, what we're trying to do is make sure that we get the people of Puerto Rico the support they need when they need it,\" he said. Puerto Rico suffering humanitarian crisis after Maria, San Juan mayor says \"All the other support they need can't come in until we get the ports and airfields open, so that's why Northern Command has placed that at the top of the list in terms of the support we're providing,\" he added. Dunford said he expects more military aircraft will be used particularly for \"generators, water, food, those kind of immediate needs.\" Priorities for Puerto Rico In addition to deploying the USNS Comfort for additional medical assistance, the Defense Department is supporting FEMA's immediate priorities for Puerto Rico including: debris and route clearance of critical transportation routes; re-opening air and sea ports; re-establishing utilities, and implementation of a commodities distribution plan. \"Northern Command continues to conduct 24-hour operations, aggressively conducting search and rescue operations, bringing additional essential commodities to the islands, and restoring power at hospitals, ports, airports and other critical facilities,\" according to the service. U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III crewmembers from the 14th Airlift Squadron unload supplies during a hurricane relief mission to prepare Puerto Rico for Hurricane Irma at San Juan, Puerto Rico, September 6, 2017. The US military is sending a variety of additional aircraft vehicles to assist with ongoing missions aimed to deliver critical supplies and capabilities to Puerto Rico: One C-17 Globemaster with the remaining Contingency Response Element to establish airport operations. This unit includes more than 50 personnel. One C-17 and one C-5 with the Mobile Emergency Response Support unit to provide mobile telecommunications, life support, logistics, operational support and power generation. A C-17 Globemaster III from the 437th Air Wing, Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina. One C-17 with the 3rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command from Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

Two C-130s with the FAA's Incident Staging Base Cache from Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Georgia. This unit includes approximately 50 personnel and four heavy duty trucks and equipment. The Air Force is also further increasing airport throughput capacity in San Juan by assisting the Federal Aviation Administration with air traffic control repairs. Priorities for US Virgin Islands The US military is also deploying additional aerial and medical assets to the Virgin Islands to assist in ongoing relief efforts: Four C-17s with water and meals to St Croix.

McCain: North Korea 'murdered' former detainee Otto Warmbier But having begun the grieving process, Otto Warmbier's parents are now ready to talk. And they are not mincing words. \"We're here to tell you, as witnesses to the terror of their regime, North Korea is not a victim. We felt it was time to tell the truth about the condition that Otto was in.\" Fred Warmbier's statement came during a live interview with Brooke Baldwin , one that -- for the first time -- helped answer many questions. For starters, in what condition did the Warmbiers find their son when the family was reunited upon his return from North Korea? Read More \"Using the term coma for Otto's condition is completely unfair,\" said Fred Warmbier. \"Otto had severe brain damage. Otto was systematically tortured and intentionally injured by Kim Jong [Un] ... Kim, and his regime. This was no accident.\" North Korea: Otto Warmbier's death 'is a mystery to us' Otto Warmbier was a University of Virginia student when he was detained in Pyongyang airport on the final day of a five-day tour of North Korea in January 2016. He was accused of sneaking on to a restricted floor of his hotel and attempting to steal a political poster. He later admitted to the crime and pleaded to be released. Instead, he was sentenced to 15 years hard labor. It's not known whether his confession was voluntary. In total, Otto Warmbier spent 17 months in North Korea before being released. He was taken by a medical aircraft to the US. After his arrival, doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center said his condition was severe, and that he suffered extensive loss of tissue in all regions of his brain. The North Korean government initially attributed Warmbier's condition to botulism. However, when the Warmbiers met Otto at the airport in Ohio, they found their child suffering from something inconsistent with a toxin-fueled illness. \"Halfway up the stairs [to Otto's airplane] we hear this loud, guttural, howling, inhuman sound,\" Fred Warmbier said, as his wife sat to his right. \"We hear this loud, guttural, howling, inhuman sound\" Otto Warmbier's dad on meeting his son upon N. Korea return https://t.co/eYwwkFcZRJ \u2014 CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) September 26, 2017 Cindy Warmbier said she initially hoped a return to the United States and treatment via \"good, American health care,\" might help improve her son's condition. But such optimism was crushed upon hearing Otto's wails, and upon first laying eyes on his sickly figure. She had to retreat down the steps. \"He's strapped to the stretcher,\" recalled Fred Warmbier, who continued into the aircraft. \"He's moving around, and jerking violently, making these howling and inhuman sounds.\" Admitting that they simply weren't prepared to find their son this way, the Warmbiers shared further details with a stunned Baldwin. \"He has a shaved head.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Four college assistant and associate coaches have been charged with wire fraud, bribery, travel act, and conspiracy offenses. Story highlights 10 people are arrested and accused of fraud and corruption in the \"dark underbelly of college basketball\" Charges include bribing athletes to persuade them to work with certain advisers and attend specific schools (CNN) The FBI has arrested 10 people, including college basketball coaches and high-level apparel company employees, in connection with an alleged widespread college basketball scheme. The United States Attorney's Office in New York filed three complaints that allege fraud and corruption in the \"dark underbelly of college basketball,\" acting US Attorney Joon H. Kim said Tuesday at a news briefing. Four college assistant and associate coaches -- Chuck Person, Lamont Evans, Tony Bland and Emanuel Richardson -- employed at Division I schools with top-tier basketball programs, have \"abused the trust\" placed in them by players and families, according to the complaints. They have been charged with wire fraud, bribery, travel act, and conspiracy offenses. According to the complaint, the coaches facilitated and received bribes from athlete advisers, including business managers and financial advisers Christian Dawkins and Munish Sood, over multiple instances, in exchange for directing and pressuring players and their families to retain the services of these advisers. In a second scheme, the complaints allege that the athlete advisers and individuals affiliated with major athletic apparel company Adidas paid bribes directly to student athletes and their families. The money paid was in exchange for the athlete's commitment to attend a specific university sponsored by the company, and an agreement to ultimately be represented by the \"bribe-payers\" once they enter the NBA. Read More \"All of those charged today contributed to a pay-to-play culture that has no business in college basketball,\" Bill Sweeney, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York division, added at the briefing. The bribed coaches showed little regard to the players' interests, ignoring \"red flags and seeing only the green of the cash bribes flowing their way,\" Kim said. He provided as an example an adviser who was charged with securities fraud last year and was not reviewed for his qualifications and track record by the coaches before they introduced him to the players. Defendant Jim Gatto, the director of global sports marketing for basketball at Adidas, secretly funneled cash to the families of high school recruits and disguised those payments in the company's books, according to Kim, who would not name the company. In a statement, Adidas said it had become aware on Tuesday that federal investigators arrested an employee, and that the company is learning more about the situation. \"We're unaware of any misconduct and will fully cooperate with authorities to understand more,\" an Adidas official said. As part of the investigations, undercover agents and wiretaps were used. Kim quoted coach Bland telling managers and advisers he can \"definitely mold players and put them in the lap of you guys,\" and Merl Code, a business affiliate of Adidas and its high school and college basketball programs, according to the court documents, saying \"it's on the books, but it's not on the books for what it's actually for.\" The different schools are the main victims of this scheme, Kim said. Coach Person, who also played and coached in the NBA, is employed by Auburn University, which stated it was \"saddened, angry and disappointed\" and has suspended Person without pay effective immediately. The University of Arizona had also immediately suspended assistant coach Richardson, and stated it is \"appalled to learn of the allegations as they do not reflect the standards we hold ourselves to and require from our colleagues.\" The school's planned men's basketball media day, previously scheduled for Wednesday, has been postponed. Oklahoma State University, employer of coach Evans, and University of Southern California, where coach Bland works, expressed their shock and surprise at the allegations. Both universities said they hold their athletic programs to high standards and pledged to cooperate with the investigation. The University of Louisville has also confirmed it received notice of being included in the federal investigation. It is one of 94 Adidas NCAA schools listed on the company's website . NCAA President Mark Emmert issued a statement suggesting a \"despicable breach\" of trust by the implicated coaches. \"The nature of the charges brought by the federal government are deeply disturbing. We have no tolerance whatsoever for this alleged behavior,\" he said.

Amid the debate about whether NFL players should kneel during \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" Trump on Sunday retweeted an image featuring Tillman wearing a tan Army Rangers beret alongside the hashtags, #StandForOurAnthem and #BoycottNFL. In a statement Monday night , Marie Tillman said she hopes her husband inspires Americans to unite \"The very action of self expression and the freedom to speak from one's heart -- no matter those views -- is what Pat and so many other Americans have given their lives for,\" she wrote. Here are five things to remember about Patrick Daniel Tillman: Read More He was small but fierce Arizona State's Pat Tillman assists on a tackle during a November 1996 game against in-state rival Arizona. After leading his San Jose, California, high school to a championship, he attended Arizona State University on a scholarship. At 5-foot-11, he was considered too small to play linebacker at a Division I school, but he proved his detractors wrong. While racking up a bevy of awards for academics, his prowess on the gridiron also earned him accolades. He played four seasons, helping lead his undefeated Sun Devils to the Rose Bowl his junior year. After his senior season in 1997 -- during which he racked up 93 tackles, 15 of them for a loss -- he was named the Pac-10 Conference defensive player of the year, an award that now bears his name. An Academic All-American, he graduated Summa Cum Laude, with a bachelor's degree in marketing, in 3\u00bd years. Cardinals took him with 226th pick Arizona Cardinals safety Tillman smiles during pregame warm-ups in Tempe, Arizona, in 2000. The seventh round of the NFL draft is not generally where teams find premier talent, but Tillman moved to the safety position and defied expectations again, playing in all 48 games for the Arizona Cardinals during his first three seasons, and starting in 27 of them. In 2000, he tallied more than 140 tackles along with a handful of turnovers and quarterback sacks. After the 2001 season, which coincided with the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, Tillman turned down an offer from the Cardinals that would've paid him about $1.2 million year. He opted instead to join the Army for about $1,000 a month, according to reports at the time . He joined the Army with his brother Tillman joined the Army just weeks after returning from his honeymoon with high school sweetheart Marie Tillman. Tillman had two younger brothers, Kevin and Richard. Pat Tillman wasn't the only brother to forgo a career in pro sports to serve his country. Kevin gave up the prospect of a career with the Cleveland Indians, where he played second base in the team's minor league system. After returning from his honeymoon in the spring of 2002, Pat Tillman told the Cardinals he would put his NFL career on hold to join Kevin. They enlisted together on May 31, 2002. The brothers finished basic training together before completing the Ranger Indoctrination Program and joining the 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment in Fort Lewis, Washington . They later took part in Operation Iraqi Freedom before returning to Fort Benning, Georgia, where they graduated from Ranger School. After his brother was killed in Afghanistan, Kevin Tillman accompanied Pat Tillman's body back to the United States, according to reports. Army didn't reveal friendly fire initially Tillman, shown in this June 2003 photo, was killed in Afghanistan in 2004. The initial claim was that Tillman died in an ambush outside the village of Sperah, near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan. He received a Silver Star and Purple Heart, and was posthumously promoted. Twenty-six days after his memorial service, amid heavy criticism from Tillman's parents and brother Kevin, the Army publicly acknowledged that Tillman had died from friendly fire while returning to support members of his platoon from whom he and other Rangers had been separated. He died April 22, 2004 , after being shot in the head three times by US soldiers who had mistaken him for the enemy. Later investigations and congressional inquiries included witnesses who said several soldiers and brass were immediately aware of the circumstances, and some sought to cover them up.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. \n(CNN) You'd be forgiven if you merely shrugged your shoulders when you heard the news about the breach at Equifax and thought, \"I've heard this story before.\" That kind of ambivalence can be expected when it seems like every week there is a new cyberattack or unauthorized release of consumer records. \nBut you should not shrug your shoulders. This is not a story we've heard before. The Equifax breach is a five-alarm fire -- a historic data disaster . The resignation of two senior executives at Equifax -- the chief information officer and the chief security officer -- and the sudden retirement of the CEO provides no meaningful remedy to the millions of consumers who bear the risk of breach. Richard Blumenthal Terrell McSweeny Let's be crystal clear: the personal and financial data of as many as half of American consumers may be affected. That's because the information stolen is the lifeblood of our identities in today's aggressively credit- and data-driven economy. Equifax is one of three national, for-profit consumer credit reporting agencies (CRAs) that don't need permission to amass your private personal information. These companies turn a profit collecting Social Security numbers, birth dates, drivers' license numbers, loan information, credit card accounts, mortgage data, address histories, and keeping tabs on your payment records. If you have a credit card, these agencies undoubtedly have an electronic folder with your name on it. Equifax is also a data broker. That means it makes millions from the collection, analysis, and sale of your data. And again, they don't need your permission to profit from your personal information. Read More Unlike past retailers and institutions that have been hacked, Equifax doesn't have to worry about consumers taking their business elsewhere. We have no choice but to trust that when they take our data, it is safe and secure. If you're not angry, you should be. And we share your outrage -- the labyrinth of confusing, overlapping, and sometimes contradictory laws and policies designed to protect consumers simply isn't strong enough. Year after year, identity theft is a top complaint to the Federal Trade Commission. Now millions more Americans must worry about the security of their identities. Don't waste your breath complaining to Equifax about data breach That's why Congress must immediately pass legislation that will compel companies to prioritize the security of our data. Until we strengthen the Federal Trade Commission's authority to impose civil penalties against corporations and institutions that fail to protect our data, companies will have little incentive to reform their reckless approach to our data. Under current law, even some of the most egregious examples of lax security can only be met with promises to do better the next time -- not fines or other penalties. Our existing patchwork approach among the states and various sector-specific federal mandates is also clearly failing to make our data more secure. That is why we're teaming up to develop legislation to make it clear that the Federal Trade Commission can investigate any data breach of any company that holds sensitive consumer data. Some argue that consumer harm must be proven before government can take action on a breach. Our proposal would make clear that being careless with consumer data in the first place is the harm. If the entities that hold our data cannot be trusted to protect it, then the government needs to have the tools to not only go after the criminals, but to also go after the companies that treat our financial lives with such negligence and carelessness. Only stringent penalties that put pressure on companies like Equifax's bottom lines will propel these companies to secure consumer data and take meaningful steps to ensure that their systems cannot be infiltrated by hackers and thieves. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook \nTwo years ago, the FTC established IdentityTheft.gov . The site should be a one-stop-shop where a breach victim can not only find resources, but also freeze or repair their credit across all three CRAs. To make this possible, we will need the help of the CRAs themselves so consumers can access all three simultaneously through one portal. While IdentityTheft.gov is operating and providing many good resources to American consumers, the CRAs must do their part to help make sure that victims of identity theft can recover as quickly, and with as little stress, as possible. It is a travesty that Congress has held numerous hearings on this issue but has failed to act -- even as the number and severity of breaches continue to mount. The federal government has known of the risks to the financial and personal information of Americans since the first data thefts began to crop up more than a decade ago, yet no serious steps have been taken to protect consumers.

Grassroots donations from fellow Americans are much smaller. The US territory still remains without power. And President Donald Trump has yet to visit. Those differences are partly because of issues unique to Puerto Rico, an island that already had a weakened infrastructure, a government struggling through bankruptcy -- and that had only just been hit by Hurricane Irma. In addition, each hurricane posed different threats and caused different problems. Harvey brought massive flooding, Irma deadly storm surges, and Maria catastrophic high winds. Here's a look at how the response to Maria compares and contrasts with the federal response to Harvey and Irma in several areas. Read More FEMA response A resident wades through floodwater days after Hurricane Maria made landfall, on September 22, 2017 in Loiza, Puerto Rico. Hurricane Harvey : For Hurricane Harvey, FEMA had supplies and personnel positioned in Texas before the storm made landfall on August 25. Within days, the number of FEMA employees, other federal agencies, and the National Guard deployed topped 31,000, FEMA said . In addition, FEMA supplied 3 million meals and 3 million liters of water to Texas to be distributed to survivors. Hurricane Irma : Even more federal personnel responded to Hurricane Irma when it made landfall in Florida on September 10. More than 40,000 federal personnel, including 2,650 FEMA staff, were in place by September 14. In addition, FEMA had transferred 6.6 million meals and 4.7 million liters of water to states in the Southeast after Irma as of the 14th. Hurricane Maria : By comparison, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands have seen much fewer personnel since Hurricane Maria hit, according to FEMA. In a tweet on Monday, FEMA said that more than 10,000 federal staff were on the ground in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands assisting search and rescue and recovery efforts. 10k+ federal staff are on the ground in PR/USVI assisting with search & rescue, restoring power, & moving commodities. #Maria [\ud83d\udcf7: @USArmy ] pic.twitter.com/8mbThIzD7T \n\u2014 FEMA (@fema) September 25, 2017 FEMA also said that \"thousands\" of federal staff, including 500 FEMA personnel, were on the ground in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands as of Tuesday morning. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the federal response to Hurricane Maria on Monday as \"anything but slow.\" On Tuesday, President Trump said that the recovery was more difficult in Puerto Rico because of its geography. \"It's very tough because it's an island,\" Trump said. \"In Texas, we can ship the trucks right out there, you know, we've got A-pluses on Texas and Florida and we will also on Puerto Rico, but the difference is this is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean, and it's a big ocean.\" FEMA administrator Brock Long also noted Tuesday that Puerto Rico's international airport in San Juan was operating at a limited capacity, which made moving resources into the area more difficult. Presidential visit Rufina Fernandez stands in front of her daughter's ruined house a day after the impact of Hurricane Maria, in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, Thursday, September 21, 2017. Hurricane Harvey : Trump visited Texas twice after Hurricane Harvey. The first visit came on August 29, four days after the storm first made landfall. There, he met with local, state and federal officials in Austin and Corpus Christi. On September 2, Trump made a second visit to Texas , during which he visited a shelter and handed out boxed lunches with first lady Melania Trump. Hurricane Irma : After Hurricane Irma struck Florida, Trump visited the state on September 14, four days after the storm landed. He surveyed the damage, distributed meals in Naples in a hard-hit mobile home community, and thanked federal disaster relief officials in Fort Myers. Hurricane Maria : Trump said that he will visit Puerto Rico next Tuesday , which would be about two weeks after Hurricane Maria. That was the earliest date he could reach the island due to first responders' ongoing relief and recovery efforts, he said. He said he may also stop in the US Virgin Islands as well. \"Some people say, I read it this morning, it's literally destroyed,\" Trump said, adding, \"The infrastructure was in bad shape as you know in Puerto Rico before the storm, and now in many cases, it has no infrastructure, so it's -- you're really starting from almost scratch.\" Grassroots donations NFL player J.J. Watt helped raise $37 million after Hurricane Harvey. Hurricane Harvey : The destruction in Houston from Hurricane Harvey prompted an outpouring of monetary donations. As of September 2, companies had pledged more than $157 million in relief efforts, and 69 companies had donated $1 million or more, according to the US Chamber of Commerce . Houston Texans defensive lineman J.J. Watt was the most prominent celebrity advocate of those donations, and he personally helped marshal $37 million before closing his fundraising effort on September 15. Separately, all five living former US presidents joined together to raise money for storm relief under the One America Appeal site . Hurricane Irma : Hurricane Irma's impact on Florida sparked a new wave of donations. Corporate donations for Harvey and Irma relief combined have exceeded $222 million, according to the US Chamber of Commerce . Hurricane Maria : Donations for Hurricane Maria have so far been much smaller by comparison. NBA star Carmelo Anthony, whose father is Puerto Rican, had raised about $240,000 as of Tuesday. Corporate donations have similarly been more limited, and four companies have given a collective $8.1 million, the US Chamber of Commerce announced Monday . Congressional action Edgar Morales sits and waits in line to get gas as he deals with the aftermath of Hurricane Maria on September 26, 2017 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Hurricane Harvey : Trump signed a bill that included emergency funding for hurricane relief on September 8, about two weeks after Hurricane Harvey hit. The bill, part of a deal struck between Trump and Democratic leaders, included about $22 billion for FEMA's disaster relief fund , $15 billion of which was new funds. Federal response to Hurricane Maria slowly takes shape As of Monday, FEMA had $5.03 billion available for disaster spending between now and the end of September a FEMA spokesperson told CNN. The disaster relief fund will be replenished with another $6.7 billion in October when the new fiscal year begins. Hurricane Maria : Sanders said Monday it was too early to identify a spending amount to request from Congress. \"Once we have a greater insight into the full assessment of damage then we'll be able to determine what additional funds are needed but we're still in that ... fact-finding process on that piece of it,\" she said. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other congressional leaders said there was a \"humanitarian crisis\" in Puerto Rico because of the storm. \"This is our country and these are our fellow citizens.

The news, which came as the network was still reeling from a sexual harassment scandal that forced out former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes, resulted in advertisers fleeing O'Reilly's show. Fox News ultimately decided to fire O'Reilly, not even letting him say goodbye to his audience -- the ultimate TV indignity -- after he'd served for more than two decades as the face of the network's primetime lineup. \nNearly six months later, things have seemingly changed. Hannity's Tuesday interview with O'Reilly was promoted heavily by Fox News. A graphic that appeared at least once on the lower right-hand corner of the screen hyped O'Reilly's return to the network. A similar graphic on Fox News' website did the same. And the interview appeared to have taken place inside Fox News' Manhattan headquarters. \nA Fox News spokesperson said that O'Reilly's appearance on the network was simply part of his ongoing book tour. The tour has taken O'Reilly to several media outlets, including NBC's \"Today\" show , and he is tentatively slated to appear on CNN later this year. But at the conclusion of his Tuesday night interview, Hannity invited O'Reilly back on his program, suggesting O'Reilly's could be a reoccurring guest. \n\"Come back. Will you come back?\" Hannity asked. \n\"I'll come back,\" O'Reilly answered after joking the two were due for a fishing trip first. \nThe fact that Fox News executives would permit O'Reilly to return to the network's air and let him use it as a platform to sell books only months after firing him struck some observers -- including people inside the network and at least one of the women who accused him of harassment -- as peculiar. \nIt was not clear if Rupert Murdoch, who is currently serving as chairman of Fox News, personally approved the interview. Neither representatives for Fox News nor 21st Century Fox responded to requests for comment on the matter. \n\"That's how it works at the boy's club,\" Wendy Walsh, who accused O'Reilly of sexual harassment, told CNN on Tuesday. \"That's how it works.\" \nInside Fox News, some employees also raised eyebrows about the interview before it occurred. \n\"I question how serious Fox News considers the offenses for which he was fired if they are now giving him a platform to sell his book,\" a senior Fox News employee told CNN. \"Talk about mixed messages.\" \n\"This idea of not only bringing him back on our air but to be actively promoting [his book] is totally outrageous,\" echoed another employee. \"What's the point [of firing him] if we're going to basically be welcoming him back with open arms?\" \nOne on-air personality who spoke with CNN referenced Fox News announcing on Tuesday that it had promoted several women as hosts. The person said O'Reilly's appearance served as a \"net negative\" that clouded the otherwise positive news. \n\"On a day that should be about Fox celebrating female talent with Sandra Smith, Harris Faulkner and Dana Perino getting their own gigs, O'Reilly returning allows us to be talking about a period that is hopefully behind us,\" the person told CNN. \nA Fox News spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on employees' feelings about the interview. \nFurthering the intrigue was the fact that Hannity and O'Reilly don't have the best history together. \nTwo people familiar with the relationship between the two men told CNN that it was well-known inside Fox News that they did not like each other. \nOne of the people said it was known staff should \"never say anything good\" about O'Reilly in front of Hannity. \nAnother person familiar with their relationship told CNN that Hannity even continued talking negatively about O'Reilly several months after O'Reilly had been ousted from Fox News. \nHannity all but conceded the two had not had a warm relationship while interviewing O'Reilly on his radio program last week. Hannity seemed to chalk up their history to the competition typical of the television industry. \n\"We kind of were competitors and at each other's throats,\" Hannity told O'Reilly in the interview. \"But I will say this: Since you left the channel, you and I have started having conversations and we realize I think that in many ways that it was a mistake on both our parts to think you were isolated on an island and I was isolated on an island.\" \nHannity appears to feel that he and O'Reilly have both become victims of liberals looking to silence them, and have found some kinship with him over that. \nThe two men also seem to understand they can mutually benefit from each other. O'Reilly needs a platform to promote his latest book, and Hannity is aiming to beat MSNBC host Rachel Maddow in the 9 p.m. ratings race.

And they are not mincing words. \"We're here to tell you, as witnesses to the terror of their regime, North Korea is not a victim. We felt it was time to tell the truth about the condition that Otto was in.\" Fred Warmbier's statement came during a live interview with Brooke Baldwin , one that -- for the first time -- helped answer many questions. For starters, in what condition did the Warmbiers find their son when the family was reunited upon his return from North Korea? Read More \"Using the term coma for Otto's condition is completely unfair,\" said Fred Warmbier. \"Otto had severe brain damage. Otto was systematically tortured and intentionally injured by Kim Jong [Un] ... Kim, and his regime. This was no accident.\" North Korea: Otto Warmbier's death 'is a mystery to us' Otto Warmbier was a University of Virginia student when he was detained in Pyongyang airport on the final day of a five-day tour of North Korea in January 2016. He was accused of sneaking on to a restricted floor of his hotel and attempting to steal a political poster. He later admitted to the crime and pleaded to be released. Instead, he was sentenced to 15 years hard labor. It's not known whether his confession was voluntary. In total, Otto Warmbier spent 17 months in North Korea before being released. He was taken by a medical aircraft to the US. After his arrival, doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center said his condition was severe, and that he suffered extensive loss of tissue in all regions of his brain. The North Korean government initially attributed Warmbier's condition to botulism. However, when the Warmbiers met Otto at the airport in Ohio, they found their child suffering from something inconsistent with a toxin-fueled illness. \"Halfway up the stairs [to Otto's airplane] we hear this loud, guttural, howling, inhuman sound,\" Fred Warmbier said, as his wife sat to his right. \"We hear this loud, guttural, howling, inhuman sound\" Otto Warmbier's dad on meeting his son upon N. Korea return https://t.co/eYwwkFcZRJ \n\u2014 CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) September 26, 2017 Cindy Warmbier said she initially hoped a return to the United States and treatment via \"good, American health care,\" might help improve her son's condition. But such optimism was crushed upon hearing Otto's wails, and upon first laying eyes on his sickly figure. She had to retreat down the steps. \"He's strapped to the stretcher,\" recalled Fred Warmbier, who continued into the aircraft. \"He's moving around, and jerking violently, making these howling and inhuman sounds.\" Admitting that they simply weren't prepared to find their son this way, the Warmbiers shared further details with a stunned Baldwin. \"He has a shaved head. His eyes are darting around ... they're as big as saucers,\" Fred Warmbier continued. \"He's blind, he's deaf, he's got a feeding tube.\" Fred Warmbier was joined by his other son, Austin, during this first visit with Otto, and the pair desperately tried to connect with the family member who'd been missing from their lives for 17 months. But it was a lost cause. \"He's a complete vegetable,\" Fred Warmbier explained. \"There was no comforting Otto.\" Two days after his return to the United States, Otto Warmbier's fever spiked, and four days after that, he was gone.

For them, their son had already been through too much. \"Otto was abandoned by his family, his country, and the rest of the world,\" Fred Warmbier said. \"Ultimately when Kim [Jong Un] made the decision, Otto was tortured, and essentially murdered. Enough. Enough.\" Cindy Warmbier's reason for refusing an autopsy: \"I wasn't going to let him out of my sight,\" she told Baldwin, adding \"and I didn't.\" The Warmbiers have received no information from the US government, but they say \"we don't need it.\" Their message is directed entirely at North Korea. \"This is solely the responsibility of the Kim [Jong Un] regime,\" said Fred Warmbier. \"Nobody should go there, ever,\" Cindy Warmbier said of North Korea. \"I don't want to see anyone else hurt or taken.\" Who was Otto Warmbier? Cindy Warmbier told Baldwin she's growing stronger by the day, aided in part by the relationship she had with her son for more than two decades. It's a bond, she pledged, that continues even as she mourns his death. \"Almost every minute of every day, I think of Otto. He's always going to be with me. It's a wonderful memory,\" said Cindy Warmbier. \"I don't want to remember Otto in North Korea, or in the hospital.

According to a group of conservative Catholics who just accused Pope Francis of spreading heresy , it's the latter.\nJill Filipovic Sixty-two (somewhat marginal) Catholic scholars and clergy have signed a letter that disputes Francis' signaling of his willingness to allow divorced and remarried people to receive communion. This, they say, is immoral and heretical, a sign of Francis \"misleading the flock.\" Far better, in this retrograde reading of doctrine, to ostracize and shame the remarried as \"adulterers\" and the divorced as sinful failures. Really? I've seen how this \"old way\" played out in my own family, and it puts Pope Francis' more reform-minded church in useful perspective. My grandparents were devout Catholics, married young, and had five children; my grandfather also beat my grandmother. She eventually left -- a painful and terrifying decision for a woman with only a high school degree in 1950s America. She supported the five kids by working multiple low-wage jobs at once. He did his damnedest to skirt financial responsibility, and she struggled her entire life. JUST WATCHED Pope Francis: 'God weeps' for abuse victims Replay More Videos ...

Read More Two decades later, my grandfather met a woman he wanted to marry -- in the Catholic Church. He had remained devout, and so was granted an annulment from the marriage to my grandmother -- and poof, it didn't exist. Their years together, their five children, just erased so he could remain in the good graces of his faith. That, according to the moral compass of the current Francis critics, is \"moral.\" And my grandma, by those lights, was a failure. Had she remarried before my grandfather, she would have been considered an adulterer. She could have gotten an annulment too, I suppose, which would have lifted that fate from her, but this was a laborious process back then that could take years -- a process that Francis made easier two years ago , permitting, among other things, a fast-track. What's more, for my grandmother, living in a culture where a marriage sanctioned by the Catholic faith constituted a powerful aspect of personal identity, it's easy to imagine that the idea of expunging what was a very real union would have felt like an unforgivable lie (especially to tell before God).

Was refusing her, as a divorced woman, the right to take communion -- and casting her as a sinful outsider -- moral? Was it Christ-like? Maybe not, but it was a routine and intractable part of Church practice. My grandparents are both dead. My grandmother retained her faith in God, but not in the church. My grandfather stayed loyal to Rome -- although he was critical of the changes of Vatican II, which liberalized the church just slightly. He played by the church's rules, technically, and considered himself a good and devoted Catholic; the church loved him right back. A Catholic priest spoke at his funeral, and his religious friends attended. My grandmother worked herself to the bone for her entire life, and spent her final years in terrible decline, unable to attend religious services or maintain friendships. There was no funeral for her, and certainly no speeches from men in robes, because in the end, all she had were her children and grandchildren. We loved her fiercely, but she deserved so much more. We marked her death privately, and we felt it acutely -- not just losing her, but all she lost in her life. I knew my grandfather as a warm, loving figure who built tree houses and told my sister and I too-racy jokes. I only learned about that uglier, personal part of my family's history much later. People are complex, it turns out, capable of great kindness and great cruelty in a single lifetime. The lives of mere mortals on earth are complicated.

Religious doctrine draws predictable and neat lines, but make it too rigid and it snaps under the pressure of heavy, messy reality. The beautiful parts of faith and belief can break along with it, too -- which is why my own mother didn't raise her children in the church. And which is why I carry my own bitterness and anger toward the church and everything it stands for -- especially its misogyny. Women still cannot hold the same leadership positions as men, a reality that -- despite his theoretical explorations of that possibility -- will keep this pope from being known as a true \"progressive.\" When you lose compassion for humanity, and when you lose the ability to love and honor and fully receive people as they come to you -- flawed, broken, evolving, all of us clawing our way to something we hope is better -- you have lost sight of why people seek spirituality and religion in the first place, and of what the Bible itself tells us. Those accusing Pope Francis of heresy might ask themselves how compassion can be at odds with the will of a benevolent God. Of course every institution needs rules; of course religions have codes of conduct. But when you begin to hold fidelity to rigid doctrine above open-hearted service to people -- when you claim to do God's work on earth but put hidebound rules before earthbound mercy -- you should look in the mirror and ask yourself who you're really serving.

The USS Kearsarge Amphibious Ready Group has already been conducting rescue operations in the region, including eight medical evacuations and 148 airlifts, and delivered 44,177 pounds of relief supplies and cargo to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands since Maria struck, according to the Pentagon. The US Air Force is also sending additional aircraft to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to ramp up the volume of daily relief missions.

Joseph Dunford said the priority is making sure airfields can operate. \"The responsibility is primarily DHS, but at this point we're not trapped in bureaucratic niceties, what we're trying to do is make sure that we get the people of Puerto Rico the support they need when they need it,\" he said. Puerto Rico suffering humanitarian crisis after Maria, San Juan mayor says \"All the other support they need can't come in until we get the ports and airfields open, so that's why Northern Command has placed that at the top of the list in terms of the support we're providing,\" he added. Dunford said he expects more military aircraft will be used particularly for \"generators, water, food, those kind of immediate needs.\" Priorities for Puerto Rico In addition to deploying the USNS Comfort for additional medical assistance, the Defense Department is supporting FEMA's immediate priorities for Puerto Rico including: debris and route clearance of critical transportation routes; re-opening air and sea ports; re-establishing utilities, and implementation of a commodities distribution plan. \"Northern Command continues to conduct 24-hour operations, aggressively conducting search and rescue operations, bringing additional essential commodities to the islands, and restoring power at hospitals, ports, airports and other critical facilities,\" according to the service.

Kim said Tuesday at a news briefing. Four college assistant and associate coaches -- Chuck Person, Lamont Evans, Tony Bland and Emanuel Richardson -- employed at Division I schools with top-tier basketball programs, have \"abused the trust\" placed in them by players and families, according to the complaints. They have been charged with wire fraud, bribery, travel act, and conspiracy offenses. According to the complaint, the coaches facilitated and received bribes from athlete advisers, including business managers and financial advisers Christian Dawkins and Munish Sood, over multiple instances, in exchange for directing and pressuring players and their families to retain the services of these advisers. In a second scheme, the complaints allege that the athlete advisers and individuals affiliated with major athletic apparel company Adidas paid bribes directly to student athletes and their families. The money paid was in exchange for the athlete's commitment to attend a specific university sponsored by the company, and an agreement to ultimately be represented by the \"bribe-payers\" once they enter the NBA. Read More \"All of those charged today contributed to a pay-to-play culture that has no business in college basketball,\" Bill Sweeney, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York division, added at the briefing. The bribed coaches showed little regard to the players' interests, ignoring \"red flags and seeing only the green of the cash bribes flowing their way,\" Kim said. He provided as an example an adviser who was charged with securities fraud last year and was not reviewed for his qualifications and track record by the coaches before they introduced him to the players. Defendant Jim Gatto, the director of global sports marketing for basketball at Adidas, secretly funneled cash to the families of high school recruits and disguised those payments in the company's books, according to Kim, who would not name the company. In a statement, Adidas said it had become aware on Tuesday that federal investigators arrested an employee, and that the company is learning more about the situation. \"We're unaware of any misconduct and will fully cooperate with authorities to understand more,\" an Adidas official said. As part of the investigations, undercover agents and wiretaps were used. Kim quoted coach Bland telling managers and advisers he can \"definitely mold players and put them in the lap of you guys,\" and Merl Code, a business affiliate of Adidas and its high school and college basketball programs, according to the court documents, saying \"it's on the books, but it's not on the books for what it's actually for.\" The different schools are the main victims of this scheme, Kim said. Coach Person, who also played and coached in the NBA, is employed by Auburn University, which stated it was \"saddened, angry and disappointed\" and has suspended Person without pay effective immediately. The University of Arizona had also immediately suspended assistant coach Richardson, and stated it is \"appalled to learn of the allegations as they do not reflect the standards we hold ourselves to and require from our colleagues.\" The school's planned men's basketball media day, previously scheduled for Wednesday, has been postponed. Oklahoma State University, employer of coach Evans, and University of Southern California, where coach Bland works, expressed their shock and surprise at the allegations. Both universities said they hold their athletic programs to high standards and pledged to cooperate with the investigation. The University of Louisville has also confirmed it received notice of being included in the federal investigation. It is one of 94 Adidas NCAA schools listed on the company's website . NCAA President Mark Emmert issued a statement suggesting a \"despicable breach\" of trust by the implicated coaches. \"The nature of the charges brought by the federal government are deeply disturbing. We have no tolerance whatsoever for this alleged behavior,\" he said.

Luther Strange conceded the Alabama primary runoff just after 9:30 p.m. ET Roy Moore has been a lightning rod for controversy for more than a decade Montgomery, Alabama (CNN) Roy Moore, the bombastic evangelical Christian who was twice ousted as Alabama's chief justice, has beaten Sen. Luther Strange in a Republican primary.\nMoore's win is sending shockwaves through the GOP establishment -- including at the White House, where President Donald Trump had poured his own political capital into helping Strange survive. At his victory party, Moore said he'd spoken Tuesday night with Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas. He also offered a national audience a glimpse of his religious-themed rhetoric. \"We have to return the knowledge of God and the Constitution of the United States to the United States Congress,\" Moore said. \"I believe we can make America great, but we must make America good,\" he said. \"And we cannot make America good without acknowledging the sovereign source of that goodness ... which is almighty God.\" Read More With 100% of precincts reporting, Moore had 54.6% of the vote to Strange's 45.4%, according to the Alabama Secretary of State's office. Strange conceded shortly after 8:30 p.m. local time, 9:30 p.m. ET. \"I am especially grateful for the support of President Trump and Vice President Pence, as well as the strong example set by my friends Richard Shelby and Jeff Sessions. I congratulate Roy Moore on the result this evening,\" Strange said in a statement. \"May God be with him and may God continue to bless Alabama and the United States of America.\" Trump, who campaigned for Strange last week and has tweeted in support of his candidacy, congratulated Moore on Twitter. \"Congratulations to Roy Moore on his Republican Primary win in Alabama. Luther Strange started way back & ran a good race. Roy, WIN in Dec!\" he tweeted . Congratulations to Roy Moore on his Republican Primary win in Alabama. Luther Strange started way back & ran a good race. Roy, WIN in Dec!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2017 Moore later tweeted that he spoke to Trump, who endorsed his opponent, after his victory. He tweeted, \"Great to talk with President Trump tonight about #ALSen! I very much look forward to working with the President to win in December!\" A source familiar with the call confirmed they spoke, saying Trump congratulated Moore on the victory. The President tweeted Wednesday morning that Moore \"sounds like a really great guy who ran a fantastic race.\" Moore's victory sets the stage for a spate of intra-party bouts in 2018's midterm elections. Already, conservative outsiders in Nevada, Arizona and elsewhere say they see in Moore's win a roadmap they can follow. And, like Moore, they have support from Steve Bannon , the former Trump White House chief strategist who has portrayed the contests as rebukes of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and congressional leadership that has failed to enact Trump's agenda. RELATED: Bannon, Farage say Roy Moore can save Trump from himself Moore now faces Democratic nominee Doug Jones in a December general election in the race to replace Sessions. Moore's win Tuesday night will thrust his long history of homophobic and racially tinged remarks into the spotlight. He has campaigned on a platform of placing Christianity at the center of public life. In 2003, Moore was removed as state Supreme Court chief justice for refusing to take down a Ten Commandments monument. He was re-elected to the job, and then ousted again in 2016, when he refused to follow the US Supreme Court's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. Though Alabama is a solidly red state, Democrats hope Jones, a former federal prosecutor who rose to prominence by leading the government's case against two perpetrators of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, can make the race competitive. Former Vice President Joe Biden plans to visit Alabama to campaign with Jones on October 3. Roy Moore's greatest hits \"After years of embarrassing headlines about top public officials in this state, this race is about the people of Alabama and about choosing a candidate with character and integrity they can be proud of,\" Jones said in a statement after Moore's win was announced. \"I will never embarrass the people of Alabama. I am running so the people of Alabama can be proud of their next senator.\" Moore overcame a barrage of negative television advertisements from forces aligned with McConnell. Steven Law, the president of the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund super PAC that spent $10 million against Moore, said he \"won this nomination fair and square and he has our support, as it is vital that we keep this seat in Republican hands.\" Moore and his allies persistently bashed McConnell, accusing him of attempting to buy a Senate seat. \"They think you're a pack of morons. They think you're nothing but rubes,\" Bannon told Moore's supporters at an election eve rally in Fairhope. But it was Strange's association with another controversial figure, former Gov.

The difficult decision to pull a second major repeal bill came the same day the veteran Kentucky Republican faced two other thorny political challenges. First, the McConnell-backed candidate in the runoff for an Alabama senate seat, Sen. Luther Strange, was defeated by a far-right conservative, Judge Roy Moore, who is highly critical of McConnell and his establishment bona fides. Read More \"I'm now enemy No. 1,\" Moore warned McConnell in a recent fundraising message, a reflection of how difficult Moore could make things if he wins a seat in the McConnell-led chamber. RELATED: Here's everything you need to know about the Alabama Senate race Conservative voices off Capitol Hill also gunned for McConnell. At a rally for Moore this week, the politically powerful former Trump adviser Steve Bannon blasted McConnell and made clear he wants him out . \"Mitch McConnell and this permanent political class is the most corrupt and incompetent group of individuals in this country,\" Bannon declared. Asked if a loss for Strange would negatively impact McConnell's reputation on Capitol Hill, conservative Alabama GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne said: \"The Senate is such a clubby place I can't begin to tell you how it will affect him in the Senate.\" But, he added, \"House Republicans are already unhappy with the Senate. That's not a secret and I don't think this will make this any worse but it is indicative of broader unhappiness among the Republican electorate.\" Corker announcement The second political challenge for McConnell came when Sen. Bob Corker, the two-term Republican from Tennessee and chairman of the foreign relations committee, who has been a McConnell ally and steady presence in the GOP conference, announced he would retire rather than run again . McConnell had urged Corker to stay on, Senate sources told CNN, and his decision to leave opens the seat to possible Democratic takeover, albeit in a reliably Republican state. Before the repeal bill was officially ditched, the leader of a group of conservative GOP House members cautioned McConnell \"all options\" would be \"on the table\" to challenge McConnell if he didn't deliver on the Republican agenda. \"We would hope that the majority leader would listen to his constituents as much as we listen to ours throughout the states we represent,\" said Rep. Mark Walker, R-North Carolina, who chairs the influential and conservative Republican Study Committee. \"We hope he can deliver on those promises but if not then we put all options on the table.\" RSC chair calls female colleagues 'eye candy' during remarks While Walker has no vote in Senate leadership elections, he can whip up political opposition and raise doubts about McConnell staying in power. McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, are accustomed to rabble rousers on their right flanks. Both had promised drama-free governing that would try to pass spending bills on time and operate the mechanisms of government smoothly. But they also promised again and again to repeal Obamacare -- something anti-big government conservatives chaffed for -- perhaps without fully recognizing how difficult that might be. Several Senate Republicans downplayed the notion McConnell's leadership post was endangered. It would fall to them to vote him out and there was little evidence they were prepared to take that step now. \"This isn't Mitch's fault. The fault that we got here is that we have too many people running around like a bunch of free-range chicken,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, about the convoluted health care negotiations that divided the moderate and conservative members of the Senate GOP conference. \"We have failed as a caucus. It's not just leadership, it's membership,\" said Sen. David Purdue, R-Georgia, when asked if McConnell should stay on as GOP leader. At tax reform talk, Trump warns he'll work with Democrats on health care Almost all Republican senators said it was time to turn to tax reform, the next big policy goal for Trump and congressional Republicans that they hope will unify the GOP across the spectrum and provide a major legislative accomplishment for voters before the midterm elections. \"There was no talk of changing leadership or anything else,\" said Sen. John Hoeven, R-North Dakota. \"As far as our leadership structure, I don't hear anybody saying that's changing. The focus is all on getting taxes really done by the end of the year and continuing to work on health care.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who co-authored and championed the bill defended McConnell. \"The leadership team has done everything we've asked them,\" Graham said. One GOP senator who has clashed with McConnell in the past was asked if, considering the health care debacle, McConnell is still an effective leader. \"He certainly led us to the confirmation of (Supreme Court Justice Neil) Gorsuch,\" replied Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, in a sarcastic reference to what McConnell critics see as the only major accomplishment for Republicans since they've had unified control of Congress and the White House. \"Listen, these are very difficult issues. It's not easy herding cats.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n(CNN) Is Catholicism about faith and compassion, or rigid doctrine and exclusion? According to a group of conservative Catholics who just accused Pope Francis of spreading heresy , it's the latter.\nJill Filipovic Sixty-two (somewhat marginal) Catholic scholars and clergy have signed a letter that disputes Francis' signaling of his willingness to allow divorced and remarried people to receive communion. This, they say, is immoral and heretical, a sign of Francis \"misleading the flock.\" Far better, in this retrograde reading of doctrine, to ostracize and shame the remarried as \"adulterers\" and the divorced as sinful failures. Really? I've seen how this \"old way\" played out in my own family, and it puts Pope Francis' more reform-minded church in useful perspective. My grandparents were devout Catholics, married young, and had five children; my grandfather also beat my grandmother. She eventually left -- a painful and terrifying decision for a woman with only a high school degree in 1950s America. She supported the five kids by working multiple low-wage jobs at once. He did his damnedest to skirt financial responsibility, and she struggled her entire life. JUST WATCHED Pope Francis: 'God weeps' for abuse victims\nPope Francis: 'God weeps' for abuse victims 01:18 The kids had to drop out of Catholic school because she couldn't afford the tuition, and back then the school wasn't about to give a scholarship to the family of a divorced mother. Read More Two decades later, my grandfather met a woman he wanted to marry -- in the Catholic Church. He had remained devout, and so was granted an annulment from the marriage to my grandmother -- and poof, it didn't exist. Their years together, their five children, just erased so he could remain in the good graces of his faith. That, according to the moral compass of the current Francis critics, is \"moral.\" And my grandma, by those lights, was a failure. Had she remarried before my grandfather, she would have been considered an adulterer. She could have gotten an annulment too, I suppose, which would have lifted that fate from her, but this was a laborious process back then that could take years -- a process that Francis made easier two years ago , permitting, among other things, a fast-track. What's more, for my grandmother, living in a culture where a marriage sanctioned by the Catholic faith constituted a powerful aspect of personal identity, it's easy to imagine that the idea of expunging what was a very real union would have felt like an unforgivable lie (especially to tell before God).

Was refusing her, as a divorced woman, the right to take communion -- and casting her as a sinful outsider -- moral? Was it Christ-like? Maybe not, but it was a routine and intractable part of Church practice. My grandparents are both dead. My grandmother retained her faith in God, but not in the church. My grandfather stayed loyal to Rome -- although he was critical of the changes of Vatican II, which liberalized the church just slightly. He played by the church's rules, technically, and considered himself a good and devoted Catholic; the church loved him right back. A Catholic priest spoke at his funeral, and his religious friends attended. My grandmother worked herself to the bone for her entire life, and spent her final years in terrible decline, unable to attend religious services or maintain friendships. There was no funeral for her, and certainly no speeches from men in robes, because in the end, all she had were her children and grandchildren. We loved her fiercely, but she deserved so much more. We marked her death privately, and we felt it acutely -- not just losing her, but all she lost in her life. I knew my grandfather as a warm, loving figure who built tree houses and told my sister and I too-racy jokes. I only learned about that uglier, personal part of my family's history much later. People are complex, it turns out, capable of great kindness and great cruelty in a single lifetime. The lives of mere mortals on earth are complicated. JUST WATCHED Pope Francis slams climate change deniers\nPope Francis slams climate change deniers 01:26 Marriage can be a sacrament and a union of mutual service, or it can be a prison of abuse and spiritual death. Religious doctrine draws predictable and neat lines, but make it too rigid and it snaps under the pressure of heavy, messy reality. The beautiful parts of faith and belief can break along with it, too -- which is why my own mother didn't raise her children in the church. And which is why I carry my own bitterness and anger toward the church and everything it stands for -- especially its misogyny. Women still cannot hold the same leadership positions as men, a reality that -- despite his theoretical explorations of that possibility -- will keep this pope from being known as a true \"progressive.\" When you lose compassion for humanity, and when you lose the ability to love and honor and fully receive people as they come to you -- flawed, broken, evolving, all of us clawing our way to something we hope is better -- you have lost sight of why people seek spirituality and religion in the first place, and of what the Bible itself tells us. Those accusing Pope Francis of heresy might ask themselves how compassion can be at odds with the will of a benevolent God. Of course every institution needs rules; of course religions have codes of conduct. But when you begin to hold fidelity to rigid doctrine above open-hearted service to people -- when you claim to do God's work on earth but put hidebound rules before earthbound mercy -- you should look in the mirror and ask yourself who you're really serving.

The resignation of two senior executives at Equifax -- the chief information officer and the chief security officer -- and the sudden retirement of the CEO provides no meaningful remedy to the millions of consumers who bear the risk of breach. Richard Blumenthal Terrell McSweeny Let's be crystal clear: the personal and financial data of as many as half of American consumers may be affected. That's because the information stolen is the lifeblood of our identities in today's aggressively credit- and data-driven economy. Equifax is one of three national, for-profit consumer credit reporting agencies (CRAs) that don't need permission to amass your private personal information. These companies turn a profit collecting Social Security numbers, birth dates, drivers' license numbers, loan information, credit card accounts, mortgage data, address histories, and keeping tabs on your payment records. If you have a credit card, these agencies undoubtedly have an electronic folder with your name on it. Equifax is also a data broker. That means it makes millions from the collection, analysis, and sale of your data. And again, they don't need your permission to profit from your personal information. Read More Unlike past retailers and institutions that have been hacked, Equifax doesn't have to worry about consumers taking their business elsewhere. We have no choice but to trust that when they take our data, it is safe and secure. If you're not angry, you should be. And we share your outrage -- the labyrinth of confusing, overlapping, and sometimes contradictory laws and policies designed to protect consumers simply isn't strong enough. Year after year, identity theft is a top complaint to the Federal Trade Commission. Now millions more Americans must worry about the security of their identities. Don't waste your breath complaining to Equifax about data breach That's why Congress must immediately pass legislation that will compel companies to prioritize the security of our data. Until we strengthen the Federal Trade Commission's authority to impose civil penalties against corporations and institutions that fail to protect our data, companies will have little incentive to reform their reckless approach to our data. Under current law, even some of the most egregious examples of lax security can only be met with promises to do better the next time -- not fines or other penalties. Our existing patchwork approach among the states and various sector-specific federal mandates is also clearly failing to make our data more secure. That is why we're teaming up to develop legislation to make it clear that the Federal Trade Commission can investigate any data breach of any company that holds sensitive consumer data. Some argue that consumer harm must be proven before government can take action on a breach. Our proposal would make clear that being careless with consumer data in the first place is the harm. If the entities that hold our data cannot be trusted to protect it, then the government needs to have the tools to not only go after the criminals, but to also go after the companies that treat our financial lives with such negligence and carelessness. Only stringent penalties that put pressure on companies like Equifax's bottom lines will propel these companies to secure consumer data and take meaningful steps to ensure that their systems cannot be infiltrated by hackers and thieves. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\nTwo years ago, the FTC established IdentityTheft.gov . The site should be a one-stop-shop where a breach victim can not only find resources, but also freeze or repair their credit across all three CRAs. To make this possible, we will need the help of the CRAs themselves so consumers can access all three simultaneously through one portal. While IdentityTheft.gov is operating and providing many good resources to American consumers, the CRAs must do their part to help make sure that victims of identity theft can recover as quickly, and with as little stress, as possible. It is a travesty that Congress has held numerous hearings on this issue but has failed to act -- even as the number and severity of breaches continue to mount. The federal government has known of the risks to the financial and personal information of Americans since the first data thefts began to crop up more than a decade ago, yet no serious steps have been taken to protect consumers. Now is the time for Congress to act if it wants to avert further financial catastrophe for the American public.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "terrell mcsweeny", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "richard blumenthal", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "blumenthal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcsweeny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard blumenthal terrell mcsweeny", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ftc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal trade commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T03:39:59.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66c96f408c1e212a616f15ba155bd5b73a580e54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWEi13mrvK80LBHh_Vk0TOGqYZb_qxMvahjV1etRggPX9BDY10i8feX1XxbEAPGsmx4F03N7fHhKo20T6_I_oPTy", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Free speech doesn't come in zones (Opinion) - CNN", "title_full": "Free speech doesn't come in zones (Opinion) - CNN", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926120756-01-jeff-sessions-georgetown-0926-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 453, "comments": 0, "shares": 453}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66c96f408c1e212a616f15ba155bd5b73a580e54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWEi13mrvK80LBHh_Vk0TOGqYZb_qxMvahjV1etRggPX9BDY10i8feX1XxbEAPGsmx4F03N7fHhKo20T6_I_oPTy", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Andrea Tortora", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Free speech doesn't come in zones (Opinion) - CNN", "text": "Story highlights Andrea Tortora: Jeff Sessions' remarks at Georgetown highlighted the limitations being placed on free speech on university campuses Some campuses have adopted \"free speech zones,\" which will negatively effect the exchange of ideas, she writes Andrea Tortora earned her undergraduate degree in journalism from Ohio University in 1995. While at OU, she was editor of the independent student newspaper, The Post. Tortora is a freelance writer and communications professional based in Peoria, Illinois. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. \n(CNN) When educational institutions start narrowing their interpretation of the First Amendment, which empowers citizens to share their thoughts and opinions in public places (especially those funded by tax dollars), we should all be worried. Look no further than the Georgetown University Law Center on Tuesday afternoon.\nIt's clear that the debate over free speech on campus is more than an academic or theoretical one. Before attorney general Jeff Sessions delivered his address (about free speech on college campuses) at Georgetown, students and faculty protested his appearance . More than 130 students said they were uninvited from attending the talk -- after registering through official channels and receiving a confirmation. One student told the Washington Post those students received emails telling them they had initially been invited to the lecture in error. More than 30 faculty members released a statement condemning \"the hypocrisy of Attorney General Sessions speaking about free speech.\" Faculty and students decried Sessions' role in an administration that just this weekend denounced NFL players who silently protested by taking a knee during the playing of the National Anthem. Andrea Tortora Sessions was invited to campus by a center devoted to the Constitution, yet students and faculty were told by university officials to limit their protest to a designated \"free speech zone\" -- a practice Sessions actually spoke out against during his remarks. Read More For me, the idea of zoning free speech is personal. When my alma mater of Ohio University, a public institution, recently unveiled what it calls a \"Freedom of Expression\" policy, I did a double take. Did I mention my major? Journalism. That's right, I learned about the First Amendment at the very institution that now is trying to quash free expression. In name, OU's interim policy is Orwellian. As it stands, the code severely restricts freedom of expression by effectively banning free speech within any campus building. It states: \"Demonstrations, rallies, public speech-making, picketing, sit-ins, marches, protests, and similar assemblies are not permitted in the interior spaces of university buildings. This provision shall not limit the right of groups or individuals to reserve available facilities.\" The policy also allows the university to designate outdoor free speech zones as it sees fit. It's alarming how common this tactic of zoning free speech -- like it's a building code -- is becoming on our college campuses. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education concludes that about 1 in 10 colleges and universities have zoned free speech . By making parts of a public university campus off limits for free speech, Ohio University and other schools restrict people -- especially students and faculty -- from exercising their rights to freedom of expression. I would be a completely different person today if the current policy had been in place when I was a student. I spent most of my time at Baker Center, where students, faculty and other groups used to congregate for demonstrations, because the student newspaper office is housed there. Colin Kaepernick and James Damore deserve credit More times than I can count, I encountered other viewpoints, ideas and opinions so different from my own. Demonstrations were common inside and outside the building. Groups would pass out pamphlets or set up tables to inform others about their various causes or concerns. It's how a student like me, who was raised Catholic, ended up visiting and writing about the campus mosque. I believe from personal experience that such exposure is integral to the way young adults develop their beliefs or solidify their opinions. Let's be clear about what's happening now. People are scared, especially after what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia. Ohio University administrators, like their peers at many other institutions outside of Athens, Ohio, want policies in place to protect students from violence that can happen at demonstrations. But this fear is yielding convoluted and troubling results. Clamping down on demonstrations, rallies, sit-ins, marches and protests in the way that Ohio University's policy outlines pushes us toward a very slippery slope. If allowed to remain, this policy could be devastatingly harmful to free speech rights on college campuses across the nation. On Ohio University's campus in February, 150 students, faculty and community members were assembling peaceably at Baker Center, protesting with a sit-in against President Trump's travel ban and demanding the university become a sanctuary campus. The university police chief ordered the group to leave or be arrested. In the early evening, 70 protestors were arrested and charged with criminal trespass, without disrupting the Baker Center's normal operating hours. And there was no violence. In March, a student and protest organizer was found not guilty and an Athens County Municipal Court judge dismissed charges against the other protestors. No other major protests have occurred on campus since then, which makes the banning of indoor demonstrations seem like an overreaction. While you can restrict a lot of things in a public building -- smoking, blocking of fire exits, obstructing operations -- it is arguable that you can restrict protest , which is a form of speech. And while the university may or may not be in violation of case law, we should still expect more from institutions paid for in part by public dollars. Join us on Twitter and Facebook \n\n\nCurbing free speech rights is not the way to provide protection from unforeseen incidents that may occur in the current political climate. If we want top-notch universities to train tomorrow's leaders to uphold our national values, we need more free speech, not less. I am doubly concerned that this is happening on a campus with a long history of honoring freedom of expression and one where the College of Communications and the School of Journalism are named for and supported by the Scripps Howard Foundation , which annually honors those who champion the First Amendment. In his remarks at Georgetown, Sessions warned that college campuses were becoming \"a shelter for fragile egos\" -- while literally being shielded from questions posed by protestors relegated to a free speech zone outside. My greatest fear is the unknown that lurks at the end of this question: If students, our collective future and tomorrow's leaders, are unable to exercise their rights of free speech and assembly at a public university or pose questions to a speaker at a lecture, where does that leave us as a nation? An earlier version of this article characterized the organization, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), as \"conservative-leaning\" and cited outdated research on the prevalence of free speech zones on campus, which is now updated. The group, which receives significant funding from conservative donors, defines itself as a \"proudly nonpartisan\" organization that defends the free speech rights of students, faculty and campus speakers across a diversity of social and political perspectives. In addition, Ohio University administrators, senior director of communications services Carly Leatherwood and general counsel John Biancamano, responded to this article by saying that their policy on free expression is an interim policy that, while now in effect, is also under review during a comment period that closes the third week of October. Those administrators disagree with the author's characterization of the policy, which they say, in addition to the sections quoted in this piece, contains provisions to safeguard constitutionally protected speech while avoiding disruption of academic and research activities. FIRE, which evaluates university speech policies, gives the Ohio University interim policy a \"green light\" and the school an overall speech code rating of \"yellow.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrea tortora", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrea tortora sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tortora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james damore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin kaepernick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "college of communications", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scripps howard foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown university law center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national anthem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook    curbing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "school of journalism", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foundation for individual rights in education", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens county municipal court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "georgetown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlottesville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baker center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T03:47:00.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c327d7106ddf73eae6aecc6bb27ae6908d04d0c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWF7rhGFbxMQRePyF_rmrtGV916EinECChklzbk1ThEAwl8Yzd4RcJnVkp9xKu.8XeuN_OXvx9MYokk0iayA4ZBO", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Menendez defense seeks to undercut corrupt intent theory - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Menendez defense seeks to undercut corrupt intent theory - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170925161246-menendez-09-06-2017---7-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 8, "comments": 0, "shares": 8}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c327d7106ddf73eae6aecc6bb27ae6908d04d0c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWF7rhGFbxMQRePyF_rmrtGV916EinECChklzbk1ThEAwl8Yzd4RcJnVkp9xKu.8XeuN_OXvx9MYokk0iayA4ZBO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Laura Jarrett", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Menendez defense seeks to undercut corrupt intent theory - CNNPolitics", "text": "Newark, New Jersey (CNN) As federal prosecutors in Sen. Bob Menendez's federal corruption trial have moved from opulence in Paris and the Dominican Republic to politics in Washington, a theme from the defense team has started to emerge: intent matters.\nTestimony from three witnesses at trial this week have touched on one of the essential \"official acts\" of the prosecution's case: The Democratic senator interceded in a contract dispute his friend, Dr. Salomon Melgen, had with the government of the Dominican Republic for cargo screening at the island's ports. Mark Wells, a State Department official, described for the jury how Menendez met with Ambassador William R. Brownfield, Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics & Law Enforcement Affairs, about the port screening contract in 2012 -- leading the ambassador to schedule a separate meeting with the President of the Dominican Republic and convey the \"intense congressional interest over the favorable resolution of this contract dispute.\" Contemporaneous emails at the time also show State Department officials saying Menendez \"threatened to hold a hearing on the matter.\" The contract dispute fits into a key narrative for the prosecution, as it seeks to convince the jury that the senator used the power of his office to pressure other federal officials to help resolve business disputes in Melgen's favor -- a difficult task made even more burdensome after the Supreme Court narrowed the definition of \"official acts\" sufficient under federal bribery law in 2016. Read More But defense attorney Abbe Lowell sought to cast doubt on the prosecution's theory Tuesday, showing that Menendez was \"very concerned about drug flow and corruption\" at the ports, and therefore, any calls for congressional hearings were not about trying to get his friend's contract pushed through, but rather port security issues in general. \"If this is a case about intent, the intent has to be pursued by showing what (Menendez) was doing in the very same period,\" said Lowell, hoping to persuade Judge William Walls to admit certain evidence about the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, a State Department project that Lowell suggested would further \"contextualize Sen. Menendez's involvement in the issue.\" (Walls said Lowell may seek to introduce it later during the defense's case, but not Tuesday). If the jury buys this defense theory, then legal experts say any one of the \"official acts\" the prosecutors allege might drop away if the senator wasn't doing it for a corrupt reason. \"The defense is trying to dilute the idea that he's doing it for corrupt reasons,\" said Randall Eliason, a law professor at George Washington University and a former federal prosecutor. \"To extent they can suggest that -- it negates the (alleged) corrupt deal.\" \"Anything that provides an alternative explanation undercuts the bribery theory,\" added Eliason. \"Anything that indicates Menendez was doing it for some broader policy concern is helpful, but doesn't completely negate the idea that he did it at least, in part, for a bribe.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob menendez", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "menendez", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "william walls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william r. brownfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lowell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "randall eliason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark wells", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salomon melgen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eliason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbe lowell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "george washington university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state for international narcotics & law enforcement affairs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean basin security initiative", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "newark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominican republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melgen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T03:47:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "707b0f2c3e8fe87081f7f8b0d39767b30d8fed75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWF7rhGFbxMQRYwQtL71x8RZZLrNIv8U7NYZe8qlRpDLBaR6jZbNfo5UA1me3t_FnUp9JaNi_StwCL6qZOx0i1LtkzrHzA.nzYc-", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Polls close in Alabama Senate race between Roy Moore, Luther Strange - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Polls close in Alabama Senate race between Roy Moore, Luther Strange - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170921211836-strange-moore-split-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 10804, "comments": 0, "shares": 10804}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "707b0f2c3e8fe87081f7f8b0d39767b30d8fed75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWF7rhGFbxMQRYwQtL71x8RZZLrNIv8U7NYZe8qlRpDLBaR6jZbNfo5UA1me3t_FnUp9JaNi_StwCL6qZOx0i1LtkzrHzA.nzYc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Eric Bradner", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Polls close in Alabama Senate race between Roy Moore, Luther Strange - CNNPolitics", "text": "Story highlights Sen.

Luther Strange started way back & ran a good race. Roy, WIN in Dec!\" he tweeted . Congratulations to Roy Moore on his Republican Primary win in Alabama. Luther Strange started way back & ran a good race. Roy, WIN in Dec!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2017 Moore later tweeted that he spoke to Trump, who endorsed his opponent, after his victory. He tweeted, \"Great to talk with President Trump tonight about #ALSen! I very much look forward to working with the President to win in December!\" A source familiar with the call confirmed they spoke, saying Trump congratulated Moore on the victory. The President tweeted Wednesday morning that Moore \"sounds like a really great guy who ran a fantastic race.\" Moore's victory sets the stage for a spate of intra-party bouts in 2018's midterm elections. Already, conservative outsiders in Nevada, Arizona and elsewhere say they see in Moore's win a roadmap they can follow. And, like Moore, they have support from Steve Bannon , the former Trump White House chief strategist who has portrayed the contests as rebukes of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and congressional leadership that has failed to enact Trump's agenda. RELATED: Bannon, Farage say Roy Moore can save Trump from himself Moore now faces Democratic nominee Doug Jones in a December general election in the race to replace Sessions. Moore's win Tuesday night will thrust his long history of homophobic and racially tinged remarks into the spotlight. He has campaigned on a platform of placing Christianity at the center of public life. In 2003, Moore was removed as state Supreme Court chief justice for refusing to take down a Ten Commandments monument. He was re-elected to the job, and then ousted again in 2016, when he refused to follow the US Supreme Court's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. Though Alabama is a solidly red state, Democrats hope Jones, a former federal prosecutor who rose to prominence by leading the government's case against two perpetrators of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, can make the race competitive. Former Vice President Joe Biden plans to visit Alabama to campaign with Jones on October 3. Roy Moore's greatest hits \"After years of embarrassing headlines about top public officials in this state, this race is about the people of Alabama and about choosing a candidate with character and integrity they can be proud of,\" Jones said in a statement after Moore's win was announced. \"I will never embarrass the people of Alabama. I am running so the people of Alabama can be proud of their next senator.\" Moore overcame a barrage of negative television advertisements from forces aligned with McConnell. Steven Law, the president of the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund super PAC that spent $10 million against Moore, said he \"won this nomination fair and square and he has our support, as it is vital that we keep this seat in Republican hands.\" Moore and his allies persistently bashed McConnell, accusing him of attempting to buy a Senate seat. \"They think you're a pack of morons. They think you're nothing but rubes,\" Bannon told Moore's supporters at an election eve rally in Fairhope. But it was Strange's association with another controversial figure, former Gov. Robert Bentley, that left him damaged from the outset of his February appointment. The appointment of Strange, then Alabama attorney general, came just before Bentley was ousted amid a sex scandal. That tinge of scandal tainted Strange, and both Moore and Rep. Mo Brooks, who finished third in the August primary and didn't make the cut for Tuesday's runoff, and cast Strange's appointment as corrupt.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "luther strange", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sarah palin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump montgomery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bentley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mo brooks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert bentley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "strange", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "alabama senate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "luther strange - cnnpolitics story", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luther strange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huntsville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montgomery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T03:47:11.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3622cb419db45ae43dca65b680c6050c6cc6a990", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWF7rhGFbxMQRct71WGrz40I8XcXCxgvho7GiXoElvTCYgJoqLsGJxshgfvCFExpKklXtDn7QhtVWAMY6M.q4WVI3YA4L0JKhkqYvbB_J1FOaQ--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Mitch McConnell's rough day - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Mitch McConnell's rough day - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926162023-mcconnell-graham-cassidy-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1164, "comments": 0, "shares": 1164}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3622cb419db45ae43dca65b680c6050c6cc6a990", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWF7rhGFbxMQRct71WGrz40I8XcXCxgvho7GiXoElvTCYgJoqLsGJxshgfvCFExpKklXtDn7QhtVWAMY6M.q4WVI3YA4L0JKhkqYvbB_J1FOaQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ted Barrett", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mitch McConnell's rough day - CNNPolitics", "text": "Story highlights An Alabama Republican is running for Senate on an anti-Mitch McConnell message The Senate Majority Leader also is losing a key ally in the Senate next year (CNN) The collapse Tuesday of Senate Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act caps a brutal stretch for Mitch McConnell. \nThe Senate majority leader is facing withering criticism from President Donald Trump -- who described him as \"unpopular\" -- and many conservative Republicans who blame him for failing to accomplish the party's top legislative goal despite years of promises and months of negotiations. \"We haven't given up on changing the American health care system, we are not going to be able to do that this week,\" a disappointed McConnell told reporters, as time ticked toward a deadline at the end of the month when the GOP will lose the ability to pass an Obamacare repeal bill on a party-line vote. The difficult decision to pull a second major repeal bill came the same day the veteran Kentucky Republican faced two other thorny political challenges. First, the McConnell-backed candidate in the runoff for an Alabama senate seat, Sen. Luther Strange, was defeated by a far-right conservative, Judge Roy Moore, who is highly critical of McConnell and his establishment bona fides. Read More \"I'm now enemy No. 1,\" Moore warned McConnell in a recent fundraising message, a reflection of how difficult Moore could make things if he wins a seat in the McConnell-led chamber. RELATED: Here's everything you need to know about the Alabama Senate race Conservative voices off Capitol Hill also gunned for McConnell. At a rally for Moore this week, the politically powerful former Trump adviser Steve Bannon blasted McConnell and made clear he wants him out . \"Mitch McConnell and this permanent political class is the most corrupt and incompetent group of individuals in this country,\" Bannon declared. Asked if a loss for Strange would negatively impact McConnell's reputation on Capitol Hill, conservative Alabama GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne said: \"The Senate is such a clubby place I can't begin to tell you how it will affect him in the Senate.\" But, he added, \"House Republicans are already unhappy with the Senate. That's not a secret and I don't think this will make this any worse but it is indicative of broader unhappiness among the Republican electorate.\" Corker announcement The second political challenge for McConnell came when Sen. Bob Corker, the two-term Republican from Tennessee and chairman of the foreign relations committee, who has been a McConnell ally and steady presence in the GOP conference, announced he would retire rather than run again . McConnell had urged Corker to stay on, Senate sources told CNN, and his decision to leave opens the seat to possible Democratic takeover, albeit in a reliably Republican state. Before the repeal bill was officially ditched, the leader of a group of conservative GOP House members cautioned McConnell \"all options\" would be \"on the table\" to challenge McConnell if he didn't deliver on the Republican agenda. \"We would hope that the majority leader would listen to his constituents as much as we listen to ours throughout the states we represent,\" said Rep. Mark Walker, R-North Carolina, who chairs the influential and conservative Republican Study Committee. \"We hope he can deliver on those promises but if not then we put all options on the table.\" RSC chair calls female colleagues 'eye candy' during remarks While Walker has no vote in Senate leadership elections, he can whip up political opposition and raise doubts about McConnell staying in power. McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, are accustomed to rabble rousers on their right flanks. Both had promised drama-free governing that would try to pass spending bills on time and operate the mechanisms of government smoothly. But they also promised again and again to repeal Obamacare -- something anti-big government conservatives chaffed for -- perhaps without fully recognizing how difficult that might be. Several Senate Republicans downplayed the notion McConnell's leadership post was endangered. It would fall to them to vote him out and there was little evidence they were prepared to take that step now. \"This isn't Mitch's fault. The fault that we got here is that we have too many people running around like a bunch of free-range chicken,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, about the convoluted health care negotiations that divided the moderate and conservative members of the Senate GOP conference. \"We have failed as a caucus. It's not just leadership, it's membership,\" said Sen. David Purdue, R-Georgia, when asked if McConnell should stay on as GOP leader. At tax reform talk, Trump warns he'll work with Democrats on health care Almost all Republican senators said it was time to turn to tax reform, the next big policy goal for Trump and congressional Republicans that they hope will unify the GOP across the spectrum and provide a major legislative accomplishment for voters before the midterm elections. \"There was no talk of changing leadership or anything else,\" said Sen. John Hoeven, R-North Dakota. \"As far as our leadership structure, I don't hear anybody saying that's changing. The focus is all on getting taxes really done by the end of the year and continuing to work on health care.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who co-authored and championed the bill defended McConnell. \"The leadership team has done everything we've asked them,\" Graham said. One GOP senator who has clashed with McConnell in the past was asked if, considering the health care debacle, McConnell is still an effective leader. \"He certainly led us to the confirmation of (Supreme Court Justice Neil) Gorsuch,\" replied Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, in a sarcastic reference to what McConnell critics see as the only major accomplishment for Republicans since they've had unified control of Congress and the White House. \"Listen, these are very difficult issues.

made addressing Maria's damage difficult, Trump said (CNN) Almost a week since Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, the US recovery efforts there have been markedly different from the recovery efforts after Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Irma in Florida.\nFewer FEMA personnel are in place. Grassroots donations from fellow Americans are much smaller. The US territory still remains without power. And President Donald Trump has yet to visit. Those differences are partly because of issues unique to Puerto Rico, an island that already had a weakened infrastructure, a government struggling through bankruptcy -- and that had only just been hit by Hurricane Irma. In addition, each hurricane posed different threats and caused different problems. Harvey brought massive flooding, Irma deadly storm surges, and Maria catastrophic high winds. Here's a look at how the response to Maria compares and contrasts with the federal response to Harvey and Irma in several areas. Read More FEMA response A resident wades through floodwaters after Hurricane Maria made landfall in Loiza, Puerto Rico. Hurricane Harvey : For Hurricane Harvey, FEMA had supplies and personnel positioned in Texas before the storm made landfall on August 25. Within days, the number of FEMA employees, other federal agencies, and the National Guard deployed topped 31,000, FEMA said . In addition, FEMA supplied 3 million meals and 3 million liters of water to Texas to be distributed to survivors. Hurricane Irma : Even more federal personnel responded to Hurricane Irma when it made landfall in Florida on September 10. More than 40,000 federal personnel, including 2,650 FEMA staff, were in place by September 14. In addition, FEMA had transferred 6.6 million meals and 4.7 million liters of water to states in the Southeast after Irma as of the 14th. Hurricane Maria : By comparison, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands have seen much fewer personnel since Hurricane Maria hit, according to FEMA. In a tweet on Monday, FEMA said that more than 10,000 federal staff were on the ground in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands assisting search and rescue and recovery efforts. 10k+ federal staff are on the ground in PR/USVI assisting with search & rescue, restoring power, & moving commodities. #Maria [\ud83d\udcf7: @USArmy ] pic.twitter.com/8mbThIzD7T\n\u2014 FEMA (@fema) September 25, 2017 FEMA also said that \"thousands\" of federal staff, including 500 FEMA personnel, were on the ground in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands as of Tuesday morning. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the federal response to Hurricane Maria on Monday as \"anything but slow.\" On Tuesday, President Trump said that the recovery was more difficult in Puerto Rico because of its geography. \"It's very tough because it's an island,\" Trump said. \"In Texas, we can ship the trucks right out there, you know, we've got A-pluses on Texas and Florida and we will also on Puerto Rico, but the difference is this is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean, and it's a big ocean.\" FEMA administrator Brock Long also noted Tuesday that Puerto Rico's international airport in San Juan was operating at a limited capacity, which made moving resources into the area more difficult. Presidential visit President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence hand out food to people impacted by Hurricane Irma in Naples, Florida, on September 14. Hurricane Harvey : Trump visited Texas twice after Hurricane Harvey. The first visit came on August 29, four days after the storm first made landfall. There, he met with local, state and federal officials in Austin and Corpus Christi. On September 2, Trump made a second visit to Texas , during which he visited a shelter and handed out boxed lunches with first lady Melania Trump. Hurricane Irma : After Hurricane Irma struck Florida, Trump visited the state on September 14, four days after the storm landed. He surveyed the damage, distributed meals in Naples in a hard-hit mobile home community, and thanked federal disaster relief officials in Fort Myers. Hurricane Maria : Trump said that he will visit Puerto Rico next Tuesday , which would be about two weeks after Hurricane Maria. That was the earliest date he could reach the island due to first responders' ongoing relief and recovery efforts, he said. He said he may also stop in the US Virgin Islands as well. \"Some people say, I read it this morning, it's literally destroyed,\" Trump said, adding, \"The infrastructure was in bad shape as you know in Puerto Rico before the storm, and now in many cases, it has no infrastructure, so it's -- you're really starting from almost scratch.\" Grassroots donations Houston Texans player J.J. Watt helped raise $37 million after Hurricane Harvey. Hurricane Harvey : The destruction in Houston from Hurricane Harvey prompted an outpouring of monetary donations. As of September 2, companies had pledged more than $157 million in relief efforts, and 69 companies had donated $1 million or more, according to the US Chamber of Commerce . Houston Texans defensive lineman J.J. Watt was the most prominent celebrity advocate of those donations, and he personally helped marshal $37 million before closing his fundraising effort on September 15. Separately, all five living former US presidents joined together to raise money for storm relief under the One America Appeal site . Hurricane Irma : Hurricane Irma's impact on Florida sparked a new wave of donations. Corporate donations for Harvey and Irma relief combined have exceeded $222 million, according to the US Chamber of Commerce . Hurricane Maria : Donations for Hurricane Maria have so far been much smaller by comparison. NBA star Carmelo Anthony, whose father is Puerto Rican, had raised about $240,000 as of Tuesday. Corporate donations have similarly been more limited, and four companies have given a collective $8.1 million, the US Chamber of Commerce announced Monday . Congressional action President Trump signs a $15 billion Hurricane Harvey relief bill on September 8 at Camp David. Hurricane Harvey : Trump signed a bill that included emergency funding for hurricane relief on September 8, about two weeks after Hurricane Harvey hit. The bill, part of a deal struck between Trump and Democratic leaders, included about $22 billion for FEMA's disaster relief fund , $15 billion of which was new funds. As of Monday, FEMA had $5.03 billion available for disaster spending between now and the end of September a FEMA spokesperson told CNN. The disaster relief fund will be replenished with another $6.7 billion in October when the new fiscal year begins. Hurricane Maria : Sanders said Monday it was too early to identify a spending amount to request from Congress. \"Once we have a greater insight into the full assessment of damage then we'll be able to determine what additional funds are needed but we're still in that ... fact-finding process on that piece of it,\" she said. Federal response to Hurricane Maria slowly takes shape House Speaker Paul Ryan and other congressional leaders said there was a \"humanitarian crisis\" in Puerto Rico because of the storm. \"This is our country and these are our fellow citizens. They need our help and they're going to get our help,\" Ryan said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harvey",

Bob Menendez's federal corruption trial have moved from opulence in Paris and the Dominican Republic to politics in Washington, a theme from the defense team has started to emerge: intent matters.\nTestimony from three witnesses at trial this week have touched on one of the essential \"official acts\" of the prosecution's case: The Democratic senator interceded in a contract dispute his friend, Dr. Salomon Melgen, had with the government of the Dominican Republic for cargo screening at the island's ports. Mark Wells, a State Department official, described for the jury how Menendez met with Ambassador William R. Brownfield, Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics & Law Enforcement Affairs, about the port screening contract in 2012 -- leading the ambassador to schedule a separate meeting with the President of the Dominican Republic and convey the \"intense congressional interest over the favorable resolution of this contract dispute.\" Contemporaneous emails at the time also show State Department officials saying Menendez \"threatened to hold a hearing on the matter.\" The contract dispute fits into a key narrative for the prosecution, as it seeks to convince the jury that the senator used the power of his office to pressure other federal officials to help resolve business disputes in Melgen's favor -- a difficult task made even more burdensome after the Supreme Court narrowed the definition of \"official acts\" sufficient under federal bribery law in 2016. Read More But defense attorney Abbe Lowell sought to cast doubt on the prosecution's theory Tuesday, showing that Menendez was \"very concerned about drug flow and corruption\" at the ports, and therefore, any calls for congressional hearings were not about trying to get his friend's contract pushed through, but rather port security issues in general. \"If this is a case about intent, the intent has to be pursued by showing what (Menendez) was doing in the very same period,\" said Lowell, hoping to persuade Judge William Walls to admit certain evidence about the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, a State Department project that Lowell suggested would further \"contextualize Sen. Menendez's involvement in the issue.\" (Walls said Lowell may seek to introduce it later during the defense's case, but not Tuesday). If the jury buys this defense theory, then legal experts say any one of the \"official acts\" the prosecutors allege might drop away if the senator wasn't doing it for a corrupt reason. \"The defense is trying to dilute the idea that he's doing it for corrupt reasons,\" said Randall Eliason, a law professor at George Washington University and a former federal prosecutor. \"To extent they can suggest that -- it negates the (alleged) corrupt deal.\" \"Anything that provides an alternative explanation undercuts the bribery theory,\" added Eliason. \"Anything that indicates Menendez was doing it for some broader policy concern is helpful, but doesn't completely negate the idea that he did it at least, in part, for a bribe.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "menendez", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "william walls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william r. brownfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lowell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "randall eliason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark wells", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salomon melgen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob menendez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eliason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbe lowell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "george washington university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state for international narcotics & law enforcement affairs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean basin security initiative", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dominican republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melgen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T04:17:34.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ac20265cccef6062ea54f8aeb836714cfbfad01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWGmAysJfe_H20yf_ZqsUj1Zrygn8IdzlM7xqKpb7geIFxzs_TPMNTYOGyMZeU00Ql895Rk_NI7Z4Q--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Sleep restrictions and spiritual vegetables: India's interesting week - CNN", "title_full": "Sleep restrictions and spiritual vegetables: India's interesting week - CNN", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926115039-arpan-26-9-1-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0ac20265cccef6062ea54f8aeb836714cfbfad01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWGmAysJfe_H20yf_ZqsUj1Zrygn8IdzlM7xqKpb7geIFxzs_TPMNTYOGyMZeU00Ql895Rk_NI7Z4Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Arpan Roy, CNN", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sleep restrictions and spiritual vegetables: India's interesting week - CNN", "text": "Arpan Roy is an Indian expatriate based in Singapore.

US District Judge Nicholas Garaufis suggested at a previous hearing that DHS extend the deadline while a legislative or executive solution was still being worked out. The lawsuit is one of several challenging the legality of the government's decision to end the DACA program across the country. Before the judge started listening to arguments from either side in the case, he has already expressed repeated concern about the upcoming October 5 deadline. While DHS stopped accepting new DACA applications when President Donald Trump announced the end of the program on September 5 (with a six-month window for Congress to act), existing DACA recipients with permits that expire on or before March 5, 2018 are still eligible to apply for renewal, as long as they submit those applications by October 5.

Even with President Donald Trump asking his backers to cast a ballot for Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed to the in-demand seat after Jeff Sessions left to take over the Justice Department, the heat down South was with the firebrand. On Monday night, Breitbart boss Steve Bannon joined the candidate for a rally in Fairhope. He also has the support for a right-wing favorites Sarah Palin and Sebastian Gorka. Roy Moore wins Alabama Senate GOP primary runoff, CNN projects But Moore is hardly a product of the present political moment. In fact, he's something of a throwback to a different era of conservative rule -- the George W. Bush years, when his virulent anti-gay, right-wing views made him a national figure. Roy vs. Rove Read More \"For Mitch McConnell and Ward Baker and Karl Rove and Steven Law, all the instruments that tried to destroy Judge Moore and his family, your day of reckoning is coming,\" Bannon said at the Monday night campaign rally. This particular round of animosity is tied to McConnell's efforts, through the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC, to beat back Moore's Senate bid with a flurry of attack ads. But Rove and Moore go further back. During the 2000 race for the chief justice seat on the Alabama state Supreme Court, Moore's establishment competition, Associate Justice Harold See, drafted in Rove to help his wealthy but increasingly unhealthy campaign. To no avail. Moore won the Republican primary, avoiding even a run-off, with 55% of the vote . He defeated the Democratic nominee in the fall and began his first term in 2001. Roy, the \"Rock\" and gay marriage Moore is most famous for the fights that twice led to his departure from the state's high court. In the 1990s, Moore had done legal battle over over a wooden \"Ten Commandments\" plaque in his courtroom. But after taking over as chief justice, he escalated -- planting a granite monument to the commandments, weighing in at more than 5,000 pounds, inside the state supreme court building. JUST WATCHED Senate candidate in 2005: Outlaw gay 'conduct' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nSenate candidate in 2005: Outlaw gay 'conduct' 00:57 A series of legal challenges, successful ones, eventually left Moore with a choice: either follow federal orders and remove the rock, or be removed himself. And so he was, in November 2003 , by a judicial ethics panel. Moore ran and won again in 2012. But again, he defied a federal court decision -- this time striking down state laws banning same-sex marriage -- and found himself facing off with the same ethics body that effectively ousted him nearly a decade earlier. In April of this year, he resigned his post to pursue Sessions' vacated seat. Roy takes on same-sex parents The controversies that marked Moore's brief tenure, the first of two abbreviated terms, on the Alabama Supreme Court were not limited to his decorating tastes. A child custody case in 2002 was less of a national cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, but Moore used the outcome, and his concurrence , to author a vicious attack on same-sex parents. \"I write specially to state that the homosexual conduct of a parent -- conduct involving a sexual relationship between two persons of the same gender -- creates a strong presumption of unfitness that alone is sufficient justification for denying that parent custody of his or her own children or prohibiting the adoption of the children of others,\" he said in one of the opinion's more tame passages. In others, Moore labeled \"homosexual conduct\" by parents as being \"detrimental to the children,\" writing that it \"is, and has been, considered abhorrent, immoral, detestable, a crime against nature, and a violation of the laws of nature and of nature's God upon which this nation and our laws are predicated.\" Roy plans a constitutional convention Moore's second term as Alabama's chief justice coincided with the dying days of the fight against marriage equality. So in 2014, he sent letters to governors from all 50 states asking them to support a constitutional convention (which, under Article V, can be convened by two-thirds of the state legislatures) that would seek to define marriage as being between \"one man and one woman.\" In an interview with the Associated Press , Moore declared, \"The moral foundation of our country is under attack,\" and that the \"government has become oppressive, and judges are warping the law.\" Alas, there was no convention. Roy's poetry Moore has often spiced up his political rhetoric with live renditions of original verse. Here's a snippet from one widely Quote: d poem . It begins, ruefully: America the beautiful, or so you used to be. Land of the Pilgrims' pride; I'm glad they'll never see: Here it gets graphic: Babies piled in dumpsters, Abortion on demand, Oh, sweet land of liberty; your house is on the sand. And so on. He goes on to weave in a message in favor of capital punishment: Too soft to put a killer in a well deserved tomb, But brave enough to kill that child before he leaves the womb. If you want to read more, this October 2015 feature from The Atlantic includes an extended recollection of a poem Moore recited during a convention of Southern Baptists. Roy's take on Sharia Law ... and Obama Vox's Jeff Stein interviewed Moore over the summer. He emerged with a handful of brow-raising nuggets, but this excerpted exchange stood out. Both for its weirdness and the insight it provides into the kind of senator Moore, should he prevail, figures to be. Stein begins by asking if Moore believes that \"Sharia law is a danger to America?\" Here's what follows: Roy Moore \"There are communities under Sharia law right now in our country. Up in Illinois. Christian communities; I don't know if they may be Muslim communities. But Sharia law is a little different from American law. It is founded on religious concepts.\" Stein \"Which American communities are under Sharia law? When did they fall under Sharia law?\" Moore \"Well, there's Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana -- up there. I don't know.\" Stein \"That seems like an amazing claim for a Senate candidate to make.\" Moore \"Well, let me just put it this way -- if they are, they are; if they're not, they're not.\" GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore has said he doesn't believe Obama is a natural-born citizen The claim is, of course, entirely false. What's more interesting here is how quickly Moore concedes that he has no evidence to back it. Not that it's a particular surprise. Moore is also an outspoken anti-Obama birther. He is on record questioning the former president's provenance at least as far back as 2008, and as recently, per a KFile find , as last year. Taking questions at a gathering of the Constitution Party, Moore expressed doubt that Obama qualified, as a natural-born citizen, for the presidency. \"My personal belief is that he wasn't,\" he said, \"but that's probably over and done in a few days, unless we get something else to come along.\" All this and more could be headed to the US Senate very soon.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T05:11:38.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4cc84166d7b24b763f394db98d8c54cfe5e11a65", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGzSa1rCObCdpcZb7vTELbwUt99O6ikFH6AiWkzF4Eu7iSIEwP7NLsTaOgSwvGNPMjOckrSykMx3D2ahqJB3IAtw--", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_topstories.rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Business and financial news - CNNMoney.com", "title": "Germany's far-right party will get millions more in taxpayer cash", "title_full": "Germany's far-right party will get millions more in taxpayer cash - Sep. 26, 2017", "published": "2017-09-27T05:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170921101550-germany-flag-crumble-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 6, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 637, "comments": 0, "shares": 637}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4cc84166d7b24b763f394db98d8c54cfe5e11a65", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGzSa1rCObCdpcZb7vTELbwUt99O6ikFH6AiWkzF4Eu7iSIEwP7NLsTaOgSwvGNPMjOckrSykMx3D2ahqJB3IAtw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hadas Gold", "published": "2017-09-27T05:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Germany's far-right party will get millions more in taxpayer cash", "text": "The German economy - in 60 seconds The far-right Alternative for Germany party won far more than 94 seats in the Bundestag this week. It also gained access to taxpayer funding worth millions of euros and other official support that will help amplify its message. German law provides government funding for political parties based on their share of the vote, once they've crossed a threshold that can be as low as 0.5%. \nBy reaching a stunning 12.6% in this week's elections and winning its first seats in parliament, the AfD will receive money from the federal government for party activities, as well as other support such as office space and promotion on parliament's official website. \nGiven Germany's history, the thought of state support for the AfD alarms those in the country who fear some of the party's messages. \nThe party has become known for its online advocacy and use of memes focusing on nationalism, anti-immigration and anti-'Islamism.' Members of the party have called for an end to what they call \"the cult of guilt\" around the country's history with the Holocaust and have advocated against \"the creation of mixed peoples.\" \nOne billboard for the party featured a pregnant white woman and the message \"New Germans? We'll make them ourselves.\" \nRelated: Germany's far-right party searches for identity \nThe idea that parliament will be used as an official stage for such points of view brings to mind the Weimar era, the time that led up to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis rise in Germany,\" said professor Anna von der Goltz, of Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. \n\"The Weimar era parliament was famously polarized and fragmented, so it conjures up lots of memories of the 1920s and and 1930s and those are deeply uncomfortable to most Germans,\" von der Goltz said. \"Anything that smacks of somewhat racist pro-natalism is very suspect to Germans, so those images of a pregnant white woman and the slogan saying 'We'll make our own Germans' ... smacks of the Nazi-era population policies.\" \nJeffrey Gedim, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that while the AfD's character as a party is not yet fully formed, the \"vile and dangerous elements\" of the party are drowning out the \"more mainstream anti-establishment insurgent voices\" and alarming people. \n\"The proof is in the pudding. A lot of Germans find this very unsettling for reasons, in particular, because of their history and dark past and because this is something new in politics at the national level. A lot of Germans were convinced that the AfD would get in the Bundestag but not that they'd get double digits,\" Gedim said. \nAfD has received some federal and state level funds since it was founded in 2013, when it won a little over 4% of the vote but fell just short of the threshold to enter the national parliament. \nThis week's result means the party will have much more cash to promote its beliefs, as well as a high-profile platform. \nRelated: What next for Germany's economy, carmakers and Europe \nUnder German law, political parties receive federal funds depending on how many votes the party gained in the most recent election, weighed alongside the amount of money the party already has in its coffers. \nFor federal elections, the parties receive one euro per vote up to four million votes, then 0.83 cents per additional vote. The parties also receive 0.45 cents for every euro the party receives in private donations. The full amount the AfD will receive as a result of Sunday's election has not yet been determined because the final official results have not yet been published. \nDr. Jackson Janes, president of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said the funds can be used to shore up the party's support across the country and for state level races. \n\"This will give the AfD a chance to have more of a platform that will allow them to reach out to the public at large and not just around rallies that led up to the election,\" Janes said. \"They'll have more capacity to present themselves to the public at large. It will be interesting to see how they use that source of support to create platforms that make them look like they aren't just opposition forces that are coming across with outrageous slogans.\" \nIn addition to funding for the political party, the AfD will also receive funding for a political foundation, as the other major parties do. The foundation is a sort of think tank that does research and outreach abroad, and is often named after a German historical figure. \n\"The notion that taxes are now going to flow to this party and not only can they fund their own parliamentary work and campaigns, they can set up their own political foundation ... there will be a lot of anxiety about that and what that will be named after. There's fear they'd name it after a big right-wing figure.\" \nThe AfD's new status also means greater access to free airtime granted to political parties for its commercials on state television and radio, some of the most popular channels in the country. \nThe commercials run in the six weeks leading up to elections. The next federal election is four years away but voters in the state of Lower Saxony go to the polls next month. \nCNNMoney (New York)   26, 2017: 9:49 PM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anna von der goltz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson janes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey gedim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gedim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adolf hilter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "von der goltz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "johns hopkins university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bundestag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown university's school of foreign service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american institute for contemporary german studies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weimar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lower saxony", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T05:11:43.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1f7172ab4f271b6c26e870b9901ca858d825fa5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsMdMgH5l5vlrm0wjYhtFUFj3fZs18cWjxCg9AV5ValUnOPiNl9xFSH_6rRAAVNBtxRrT9DMfl_8J8yz4fSPwXbw--", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - HP Hero", "title": "Free speech doesn't come in zones", "title_full": "Free speech doesn't come in zones", "published": "2017-09-27T03:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926120756-01-jeff-sessions-georgetown-0926-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 457, "comments": 0, "shares": 457}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 27}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1f7172ab4f271b6c26e870b9901ca858d825fa5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsMdMgH5l5vlrm0wjYhtFUFj3fZs18cWjxCg9AV5ValUnOPiNl9xFSH_6rRAAVNBtxRrT9DMfl_8J8yz4fSPwXbw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T03:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Free speech doesn't come in zones", "text": "Story highlights Andrea Tortora: Jeff Sessions' remarks at Georgetown highlighted the limitations being placed on free speech on university campuses Some campuses have adopted \"free speech zones,\" which will negatively effect the exchange of ideas, she writes Andrea Tortora earned her undergraduate degree in journalism from Ohio University in 1995. While at OU, she was editor of the independent student newspaper, The Post. Tortora is a freelance writer and communications professional based in Peoria, Illinois. The views her own.\n(CNN) When educational institutions start narrowing their interpretation of the First Amendment, which empowers citizens to share their thoughts and opinions in public places (especially those funded by tax dollars), we should all be worried. Look no further than the Georgetown University Law Center on Tuesday afternoon.\nIt's clear that the debate over free speech on campus is more than an academic or theoretical one. Before attorney general Jeff Sessions delivered his address (about free speech on college campuses) at Georgetown, students and faculty protested his appearance . More than 130 students said they were uninvited from attending the talk -- after registering through official channels and receiving a confirmation. One student told the Washington Post those students received emails telling them they had initially been invited to the lecture in error. More than 30 faculty members released a statement condemning \"the hypocrisy of Attorney General Sessions speaking about free speech.\" Faculty and students decried Sessions' role in an administration that just this weekend denounced NFL players who silently protested by taking a knee during the playing of the National Anthem. Andrea Tortora Sessions was invited to campus by a center devoted to the Constitution, yet students and faculty were told by university officials to limit their protest to a designated \"free speech zone\" -- a practice Sessions actually spoke out against during his remarks. Read More For me, the idea of zoning free speech is personal. When my alma mater of Ohio University, a public institution, recently unveiled what it calls a \"Freedom of Expression\" policy, I did a double take. Did I mention my major? Journalism. That's right, I learned about the First Amendment at the very institution that now is trying to quash free expression. In name, OU's interim policy is Orwellian. As it stands, the code severely restricts freedom of expression by effectively banning free speech within any campus building. It states: \"Demonstrations, rallies, public speech-making, picketing, sit-ins, marches, protests, and similar assemblies are not permitted in the interior spaces of university buildings. This provision shall not limit the right of groups or individuals to reserve available facilities.\" The policy also allows the university to designate outdoor free speech zones as it sees fit. It's alarming how common this tactic of zoning free speech -- like it's a building code -- is becoming on our college campuses. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education concludes that about 1 in 10 colleges and universities have zoned free speech . By making parts of a public university campus off limits for free speech, Ohio University and other schools restrict people -- especially students and faculty -- from exercising their rights to freedom of expression. I would be a completely different person today if the current policy had been in place when I was a student. I spent most of my time at Baker Center, where students, faculty and other groups used to congregate for demonstrations, because the student newspaper office is housed there. Colin Kaepernick and James Damore deserve credit More times than I can count, I encountered other viewpoints, ideas and opinions so different from my own. Demonstrations were common inside and outside the building. Groups would pass out pamphlets or set up tables to inform others about their various causes or concerns. It's how a student like me, who was raised Catholic, ended up visiting and writing about the campus mosque. I believe from personal experience that such exposure is integral to the way young adults develop their beliefs or solidify their opinions. Let's be clear about what's happening now. People are scared, especially after what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia. Ohio University administrators, like their peers at many other institutions outside of Athens, Ohio, want policies in place to protect students from violence that can happen at demonstrations. But this fear is yielding convoluted and troubling results. Clamping down on demonstrations, rallies, sit-ins, marches and protests in the way that Ohio University's policy outlines pushes us toward a very slippery slope. If allowed to remain, this policy could be devastatingly harmful to free speech rights on college campuses across the nation. On Ohio University's campus in February, 150 students, faculty and community members were assembling peaceably at Baker Center, protesting with a sit-in against President Trump's travel ban and demanding the university become a sanctuary campus. The university police chief ordered the group to leave or be arrested. In the early evening, 70 protestors were arrested and charged with criminal trespass, without disrupting the Baker Center's normal operating hours. And there was no violence. In March, a student and protest organizer was found not guilty and an Athens County Municipal Court judge dismissed charges against the other protestors. No other major protests have occurred on campus since then, which makes the banning of indoor demonstrations seem like an overreaction. While you can restrict a lot of things in a public building -- smoking, blocking of fire exits, obstructing operations -- it is arguable that you can restrict protest , which is a form of speech. And while the university may or may not be in violation of case law, we should still expect more from institutions paid for in part by public dollars. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\nCurbing free speech rights is not the way to provide protection from unforeseen incidents that may occur in the current political climate. If we want top-notch universities to train tomorrow's leaders to uphold our national values, we need more free speech, not less. I am doubly concerned that this is happening on a campus with a long history of honoring freedom of expression and one where the College of Communications and the School of Journalism are named for and supported by the Scripps Howard Foundation , which annually honors those who champion the First Amendment. In his remarks at Georgetown, Sessions warned that college campuses were becoming \"a shelter for fragile egos\" -- while literally being shielded from questions posed by protestors relegated to a free speech zone outside. My greatest fear is the unknown that lurks at the end of this question: If students, our collective future and tomorrow's leaders, are unable to exercise their rights of free speech and assembly at a public university or pose questions to a speaker at a lecture, where does that leave us as a nation? An earlier version of this article characterized the organization, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), as \"conservative-leaning\" and cited outdated research on the prevalence of free speech zones on campus, which is now updated. The group, which receives significant funding from conservative donors, defines itself as a \"proudly nonpartisan\" organization that defends the free speech rights of students, faculty and campus speakers across a diversity of social and political perspectives. In addition, Ohio University administrators, senior director of communications services Carly Leatherwood and general counsel John Biancamano, responded to this article by saying that their policy on free expression is an interim policy that, while now in effect, is also under review during a comment period that closes the third week of October. Those administrators disagree with the author's characterization of the policy, which they say, in addition to the sections Quote: d in this piece, contains provisions to safeguard constitutionally protected speech while avoiding disruption of academic and research activities. FIRE, which evaluates university speech policies, gives the Ohio University interim policy a \"green light\" and the school an overall speech code rating of \"yellow.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrea tortora", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrea tortora sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tortora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james damore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin kaepernick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "college of communications", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scripps howard foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown university law center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national anthem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook curbing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "school of journalism", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foundation for individual rights in education", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens county municipal court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "charlottesville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baker center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T05:12:40.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2980ba12e338bc9ae1e5c5533718e087a7e1002", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGzSa1rCObCdo2xCZNarnp.mmaGR4HB8bYGFa3vBpYmn9BlkS5_fNEZ5h6n6z7uwNsAVmgGSkmQ6NrZb5FKcQQog--", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Latest financial news - CNNMoney.com", "title": "Puerto Rico largely ignored by the media in the wake of Maria devastation", "title_full": "Puerto Rico largely ignored by the media in the wake of Maria devastation - Sep. 26, 2017", "published": "2017-09-27T06:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170926122001-puerto-rico-hurricane-costs-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6067, "comments": 0, "shares": 6067}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 29}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2980ba12e338bc9ae1e5c5533718e087a7e1002", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGzSa1rCObCdo2xCZNarnp.mmaGR4HB8bYGFa3vBpYmn9BlkS5_fNEZ5h6n6z7uwNsAVmgGSkmQ6NrZb5FKcQQog--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hadas Gold", "published": "2017-09-27T06:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Puerto Rico largely ignored by the media in the wake of Maria devastation", "text": "Puerto Rico largely ignored by the media in the wake of Hurricane Maria devastation by Hadas Gold @CNNMoney September 26, 2017: 10:23 PM ET Mayor: Don't put debt above people When Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit the southern portion the United States, major news anchors and newspaper reporters flooded in along with the water. Live shots of streets that turned into rivers dominated the news coverage -- huge storms barreling towards large swaths of the U.S. will always be a big story. But Hurricane Maria, which hit Puerto Rico last week, just now seems to be gaining a fraction of the media attention that Harvey and Irma attracted despite the fact that the Commonwealth island is a U.S. territory and home to millions of American citizens. \n\"The recent storms of Harvey and Irma, there was a lot coverage prior and during....with Puerto Rico Rico we were all expecting to see more coverage,\" said Dr. Edwin Mel\u00e9ndez, director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York City. \"In all the shows, the coverage was not as extensive, such as the length and the depth of the coverage, the on-the-ground cameras.\" \nThe five major Sunday shows barely mentioned the hurricane, according to a review by the watchdog group, Media Matters . Of the major broadcast networks, only NBC sent its main anchor Lester Holt to Puerto Rico on Monday night, though all three, along with the cable networks had correspondents on the ground. A review of the hurricane coverage on the three major cable networks--CNN, MSNBC and Fox--shows a steady stream of mentions from the middle of last week and through the weekend, with a clear rise on Monday and into Tuesday. \n\"A curtain is slowly being lifted on this disaster, revealing more and more of the suffering and the dire straits on this island,\" Holt said on NBC \"Nightly News\" on Monday night. \nNewspapers also highlighted the storm, but like television, the coverage was not to the same extent as the previous hurricanes. Since the storm hit, the situation in Puerto Rico was the New York Times' main photo on its front page twice. \nMel\u00e9ndez said it was clear television crews were not in place ahead of the storm, despite the fact that the forecasts were clear that it would be a devastating hurricane. Once Maria hit, travel to the island became increasingly difficult, if not impossible. Nearly all communications have been cut off on the island. \nA recent poll shows that nearly half of Americans don't know that the people of Puerto Rico, an island and Spanish-speaking territory of the United States, are American citizens. That, along with \"hurricane fatigue\" from Irma and Harvey, could be contributing to the lack of coverage, Mel\u00e9ndez said. \n\"If it's not in the conscience of people right now, it won't be solved,\" Mel\u00e9ndez said. \"I'm afraid that because of Texas and Florida we will become an afterthought. And I think the media has a great responsibility to make sure Puerto Rico doesn't continue to be an afterthought.\" \nPresident Donald Trump, whose every move usually dominates the news cycle, wasn't using his favored mode of communication to bring attention to the hurricanes as he did with Irma and Harvey. Trump barely tweeted about the hurricane since it hit last Wednesday, but instead spent his weekend railing on NFL players who kneeled during the national anthem to protest police violence. When he finally tweeted about the disaster on Monday, he opted to focus on Puerto Rico's \"broken infrastructure & massive debt,\" before later expressing support for the island. Trump said he will visit the island next week. \n\"I hope that the president uses his visit to double down on his support of Puerto Rico,\" Mel\u00e9ndez said. \"I think his remarks were a little insensitive because you're in the midst of destruction with lives at stake and his comments about the financial debt of Puerto Rico. Why do you bring that up now?\" \nMembers of the administration have also claimed the media is ignoring the problem. \n\"While media hasn't focused on #Maria, Fema and its partners have. 10,000 federal staff working to meet @ricardorossello response goals,\" FEMA administrator Brock Long tweeted on Monday . \nSusanne Ramirez de Arellano, a former news director for Univision Puerto Rico, said in a column for the Guardian that people were turning to social media to get their news, \"Because we couldn't trust major media outlets in the United States to give us in-depth coverage of the devastation. Our disasters, we figured, just don't rate high enough in their eyes,\" she wrote in the column published Tuesday. \n\"Sadly, this treatment of Puerto Rico is no surprise,\" she said. \"Because of the island's colonial status, it is consistently overlooked and ignored. Nothing has made this clearer than the response to this disaster.\" CNNMoney (New York) First published September 26, 2017: 10:14 PM ET ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "irma", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lester holt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mel\u00e9ndez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brock long", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susanne ramirez de arellano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edwin mel\u00e9ndez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hunter college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for puerto rican studies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "univision puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico rico", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T05:25:21.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be5d17c19fba4667092c2594d84b4f418d547207", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INV86ItrMrxdfAbz5ybrNmeVbxhzwC.nMLhKL3p4Vbb.nNYQCIHZfwVOuRkOFqtaQA3GxQEQjCBH5fmTbifTHo0KAjGRAYLq2rxVZtHBTU8mA-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_freevideo.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Strange: This is not the result that we wanted", "title_full": "Strange: This is not the result that we wanted", "published": "2017-09-27T05:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926222148-luther-strange-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be5d17c19fba4667092c2594d84b4f418d547207", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INV86ItrMrxdfAbz5ybrNmeVbxhzwC.nMLhKL3p4Vbb.nNYQCIHZfwVOuRkOFqtaQA3GxQEQjCBH5fmTbifTHo0KAjGRAYLq2rxVZtHBTU8mA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T05:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "Strange: This is not the result that we wanted", "text": "MUST WATCH Strange: This is not the result that we wanted Sen.

In its 15 years, the festival has grown to include trade fairs, exhibitions, installations, talks and tours right across the capital, and has become a firm favorite on the global design calendar. Camille Walala's \"Villa Walala\" structure next to Liverpool Street station was a riot of color and pattern. A firm believer in the power of play and creating experiences that make people smile, the designer encouraged visitors (especially workers in the surrounding office blocks) to try out with her inflatable playground. Print designer Camille Walala took over London's Exchange Square with her \"Villa Walala\" installation.Credit: Andy Stagg At Somerset House , new products, like Benjamin Hubert 's tech accessories, were displayed to striking effect. In contrast with the grand courtyard, plastic waste was being recycled into entirely new products in an effort to make our trash into a valuable commodity. In King's Cross, visitors to the public Granary Square were met by \"Gateways,\" four cheerful, tiled arches designed by Adam Nathaniel Furman. This structure provided an entrance to Designjunction and its show of new furniture, lighting and accessories.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. \n(CNN) In the past month, over 400,000 people have fled from Myanmar over the border to Bangladesh. They are Rohingya, part of a mainly Muslim ethnic minority group of approximately 1 million people in the western Rakhine State of the majority Buddhist country. \nAt the current rate of outflow, which has slowed only because of monsoon rains, the majority of the Rohingya population could be removed from Myanmar with the intent of making it ethnically homogeneous -- the very definition of ethnic cleansing -- before the end of 2017. So, the international community is gearing up for military intervention, like they did in Bosnia and Kosovo on the 90s, right? Wrong. This is the age of Donald Trump and Brexit. The age of Bashar al-Assad, of Putin, of Rodrigo Duterte, of the European migrant crisis, the age of the great unraveling of the western world, and its values of universal human rights and common international responsibility. As we speak, reports suggest the Myanmar army is continuing its military operations against \"insurgent militants\" in Rakhine State. Testimonials from refugees confirm that this involves burning down Rohingya villages, killing women and children -- convincing those fleeing that it will never be safe to return to the country of their birth -- and trying to leverage China against any objections from western political leaders. Numb response Read More The UN is going to do nothing. Various UN humanitarian agencies have been at the forefront of trying to help the Rohingya for the past few years as they have struggled with several successive waves of violence from their Buddhist neighbors and several of Myanmar's federal security bodies. And the agencies, along with a significant number of leading NGOs, are at the forefront of trying to organize and maintain the overwhelmed refugee camps that await the Rohingya over the border in Bangladesh. But humanitarian bodies cannot fight national armies. For that, the UN Security Council needs to agree on joint actions. All that they have agreed on so far is to express \"concern.\" Senior UN officials I have spoken with echo this numb response: There is no appetite to do anything about this at the level of UN security bodies. Nor will Trump's America, or the weakened and divided Europe, do anything about it of their own initiative. Though the US has pledged 32 million dollars to deal with the fallout many would interpret that as guilt money as they renege on their responsibility to tackle the actual cause. This is a humanitarian disaster that could be stopped at the drop of a hat if any major power on the international stage had the moral courage to take charge of the issue and threaten Myanmar with penalties and sanctions if they continue down this road of engineering the worst refugee crisis for decades. But that is not the world we live in anymore. This seems like a done deal. And every one of those who could make the choice to stop it seem content to just stare down the clock until the affair is finished. Unwanted in Bangladesh So, what is next for the Rohingya? It seems unlikely that they will ever be able to return to Myanmar. All their homes, their towns and villages, their markets and businesses, their places of worship have been burned to the ground in an organized and systemic campaign. Just in case there was any room for doubt, the Myanmar Army are alleged to have laid mines at the border with Bangladesh to ensure no one can cross that border back into Myanmar. But at least conditions in Bangladesh will be much safer for the Rohingya, no? Well, nobody is actively trying to kill them in Bangladesh. At least not yet. Though the food shortages and healthcare deficits in the refugee camps will be doing some killing of their own. But it does not look like in Bangladesh the Rohingya will have found a new home either. The government of Bangladesh is building new refugee camps designed to keep the Rohingya separate from their own population and seem to hope, against hope, that the Rohingya might one day be returned to Myanmar.

Even with President Donald Trump asking his backers to cast a ballot for Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed to the in-demand seat after Jeff Sessions left to take over the Justice Department, the heat down South was with the firebrand. On Monday night, Breitbart boss Steve Bannon joined the candidate for a rally in Fairhope. He also has the support for a right-wing favorites Sarah Palin and Sebastian Gorka. Roy Moore wins Alabama Senate GOP primary runoff, CNN projects But Moore is hardly a product of the present political moment. In fact, he's something of a throwback to a different era of conservative rule -- the George W. Bush years, when his virulent anti-gay, right-wing views made him a national figure. Roy vs. Rove Read More \"For Mitch McConnell and Ward Baker and Karl Rove and Steven Law, all the instruments that tried to destroy Judge Moore and his family, your day of reckoning is coming,\" Bannon said at the Monday night campaign rally. This particular round of animosity is tied to McConnell's efforts, through the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC, to beat back Moore's Senate bid with a flurry of attack ads. But Rove and Moore go further back. During the 2000 race for the chief justice seat on the Alabama state Supreme Court, Moore's establishment competition, Associate Justice Harold See, drafted in Rove to help his wealthy but increasingly unhealthy campaign. To no avail. Moore won the Republican primary, avoiding even a run-off, with 55% of the vote . He defeated the Democratic nominee in the fall and began his first term in 2001. Roy, the \"Rock\" and gay marriage Moore is most famous for the fights that twice led to his departure from the state's high court. In the 1990s, Moore had done legal battle over over a wooden \"Ten Commandments\" plaque in his courtroom. But after taking over as chief justice, he escalated -- planting a granite monument to the commandments, weighing in at more than 5,000 pounds, inside the state supreme court building. JUST WATCHED Senate candidate in 2005: Outlaw gay 'conduct' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nSenate candidate in 2005: Outlaw gay 'conduct' 00:57 A series of legal challenges, successful ones, eventually left Moore with a choice: either follow federal orders and remove the rock, or be removed himself. And so he was, in November 2003 , by a judicial ethics panel. Moore ran and won again in 2012. But again, he defied a federal court decision -- this time striking down state laws banning same-sex marriage -- and found himself facing off with the same ethics body that effectively ousted him nearly a decade earlier. In April of this year, he resigned his post to pursue Sessions' vacated seat. Roy takes on same-sex parents The controversies that marked Moore's brief tenure, the first of two abbreviated terms, on the Alabama Supreme Court were not limited to his decorating tastes. A child custody case in 2002 was less of a national cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, but Moore used the outcome, and his concurrence , to author a vicious attack on same-sex parents. \"I write specially to state that the homosexual conduct of a parent -- conduct involving a sexual relationship between two persons of the same gender -- creates a strong presumption of unfitness that alone is sufficient justification for denying that parent custody of his or her own children or prohibiting the adoption of the children of others,\" he said in one of the opinion's more tame passages. In others, Moore labeled \"homosexual conduct\" by parents as being \"detrimental to the children,\" writing that it \"is, and has been, considered abhorrent, immoral, detestable, a crime against nature, and a violation of the laws of nature and of nature's God upon which this nation and our laws are predicated.\" Roy plans a constitutional convention Moore's second term as Alabama's chief justice coincided with the dying days of the fight against marriage equality. So in 2014, he sent letters to governors from all 50 states asking them to support a constitutional convention (which, under Article V, can be convened by two-thirds of the state legislatures) that would seek to define marriage as being between \"one man and one woman.\" In an interview with the Associated Press , Moore declared, \"The moral foundation of our country is under attack,\" and that the \"government has become oppressive, and judges are warping the law.\" Alas, there was no convention. Roy's poetry Moore has often spiced up his political rhetoric with live renditions of original verse. Here's a snippet from one widely quoted poem . It begins, ruefully: America the beautiful, or so you used to be. Land of the Pilgrims' pride; I'm glad they'll never see: Here it gets graphic: Babies piled in dumpsters, Abortion on demand, Oh, sweet land of liberty; your house is on the sand. And so on. He goes on to weave in a message in favor of capital punishment: Too soft to put a killer in a well deserved tomb, But brave enough to kill that child before he leaves the womb. If you want to read more, this October 2015 feature from The Atlantic includes an extended recollection of a poem Moore recited during a convention of Southern Baptists. Roy's take on Sharia Law ... and Obama Vox's Jeff Stein interviewed Moore over the summer. He emerged with a handful of brow-raising nuggets, but this excerpted exchange stood out. Both for its weirdness and the insight it provides into the kind of senator Moore, should he prevail, figures to be. Stein begins by asking if Moore believes that \"Sharia law is a danger to America?\" Here's what follows: Roy Moore \"There are communities under Sharia law right now in our country. Up in Illinois. Christian communities; I don't know if they may be Muslim communities. But Sharia law is a little different from American law. It is founded on religious concepts.\" Stein \"Which American communities are under Sharia law? When did they fall under Sharia law?\" Moore \"Well, there's Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana -- up there. I don't know.\" Stein \"That seems like an amazing claim for a Senate candidate to make.\" Moore \"Well, let me just put it this way -- if they are, they are; if they're not, they're not.\" GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore has said he doesn't believe Obama is a natural-born citizen The claim is, of course, entirely false. What's more interesting here is how quickly Moore concedes that he has no evidence to back it. Not that it's a particular surprise. Moore is also an outspoken anti-Obama birther. He is on record questioning the former president's provenance at least as far back as 2008, and as recently, per a KFile find , as last year. Taking questions at a gathering of the Constitution Party, Moore expressed doubt that Obama qualified, as a natural-born citizen, for the presidency. \"My personal belief is that he wasn't,\" he said, \"but that's probably over and done in a few days, unless we get something else to come along.\" All this and more could be headed to the US Senate very soon.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven law", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luther strange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karl rove", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rove", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harold see", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sebastian gorka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george w. bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff stein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah palin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ward baker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "breitbart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "constitution party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama vox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama senate gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us senate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dixie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fairhope", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T05:42:36.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2bb530195e5777b62cd25dd688c54b43c7fe8736", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INV86ItrMrxdfAbz5ybrNmeQjEoAbGP7ye71AGIcg.DWD_pTBAwNIGDIab15yH1f2MmbigizcsMwPS7hJbSCln8w--", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_freevideo.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Roy Moore: We can support the President", "title_full": "Roy Moore: We can support the President", "published": "2017-09-27T05:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926220439-roy-moore-hq-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 27, "comments": 0, "shares": 27}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2bb530195e5777b62cd25dd688c54b43c7fe8736", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INV86ItrMrxdfAbz5ybrNmeQjEoAbGP7ye71AGIcg.DWD_pTBAwNIGDIab15yH1f2MmbigizcsMwPS7hJbSCln8w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T05:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Roy Moore: We can support the President", "text": "MUST WATCH Roy Moore beats out candidate Trump supported Roy Moore, the evangelical Christian who was twice ousted as Alabama's chief justice, has beaten Sen.

The views expressed his own.\n(CNN) In the past month, over 400,000 people have fled from Myanmar over the border to Bangladesh. They are Rohingya, part of a mainly Muslim ethnic minority group of approximately 1 million people in the western Rakhine State of the majority Buddhist country.\nAt the current rate of outflow, which has slowed only because of monsoon rains, the majority of the Rohingya population could be removed from Myanmar with the intent of making it ethnically homogeneous -- the very definition of ethnic cleansing -- before the end of 2017. So, the international community is gearing up for military intervention, like they did in Bosnia and Kosovo on the 90s, right? Wrong. This is the age of Donald Trump and Brexit. The age of Bashar al-Assad, of Putin, of Rodrigo Duterte, of the European migrant crisis, the age of the great unraveling of the western world, and its values of universal human rights and common international responsibility. As we speak, reports suggest the Myanmar army is continuing its military operations against \"insurgent militants\" in Rakhine State. Testimonials from refugees confirm that this involves burning down Rohingya villages, killing women and children -- convincing those fleeing that it will never be safe to return to the country of their birth -- and trying to leverage China against any objections from western political leaders. Numb response Read More The UN is going to do nothing. Various UN humanitarian agencies have been at the forefront of trying to help the Rohingya for the past few years as they have struggled with several successive waves of violence from their Buddhist neighbors and several of Myanmar's federal security bodies. And the agencies, along with a significant number of leading NGOs, are at the forefront of trying to organize and maintain the overwhelmed refugee camps that await the Rohingya over the border in Bangladesh. But humanitarian bodies cannot fight national armies. For that, the UN Security Council needs to agree on joint actions. All that they have agreed on so far is to express \"concern.\" Senior UN officials I have spoken with echo this numb response: There is no appetite to do anything about this at the level of UN security bodies. Nor will Trump's America, or the weakened and divided Europe, do anything about it of their own initiative. Though the US has pledged 32 million dollars to deal with the fallout many would interpret that as guilt money as they renege on their responsibility to tackle the actual cause. This is a humanitarian disaster that could be stopped at the drop of a hat if any major power on the international stage had the moral courage to take charge of the issue and threaten Myanmar with penalties and sanctions if they continue down this road of engineering the worst refugee crisis for decades. But that is not the world we live in anymore. This seems like a done deal. And every one of those who could make the choice to stop it seem content to just stare down the clock until the affair is finished. Unwanted in Bangladesh So, what is next for the Rohingya? It seems unlikely that they will ever be able to return to Myanmar. All their homes, their towns and villages, their markets and businesses, their places of worship have been burned to the ground in an organized and systemic campaign. Just in case there was any room for doubt, the Myanmar Army are alleged to have laid mines at the border with Bangladesh to ensure no one can cross that border back into Myanmar. But at least conditions in Bangladesh will be much safer for the Rohingya, no? Well, nobody is actively trying to kill them in Bangladesh. At least not yet. Though the food shortages and healthcare deficits in the refugee camps will be doing some killing of their own. But it does not look like in Bangladesh the Rohingya will have found a new home either. The government of Bangladesh is building new refugee camps designed to keep the Rohingya separate from their own population and seem to hope, against hope, that the Rohingya might one day be returned to Myanmar. This is also why the government of Bangladesh is resisting, as much as it possibly can, giving refugee status to the new arrivals.

The South Asian nation is already one of the world's hottest mobile markets, with everyone from Samsung ( SSNLF ) and Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) to China's Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi fighting with Indian brands such as Micromax for a piece of the action. And it's just getting started. Experts say India's tally of 300 million smartphone users could grow by more than 50% in the next few years. \nHere's what makes India such an attractive bet: \n1 billion Indians don't yet have a smartphone \nThere are about 650 million mobile phone users in India, and just over 300 million of them have a smartphone, according to technology consultancy Counterpoint Research. \nThat means India is already a bigger smartphone market than the U.S. and second only to China. \nIt also means there are about1 billion Indians who do not yet have a smartphone -- a huge market opportunity. \n\"India is in a very sweet spot in terms of smartphone growth,\" said Shobhit Srivastava, an analyst at Counterpoint Research. \"You have over 300 million people sitting on a 2G device that will eventually move forward to a smartphone... this is the potential that India holds.\" \nTwo out of three Indian mobile users -- or roughly 433 million people -- are planning to upgrade their phones in the next year, according to a recent Counterpoint survey. \nNearly 900 million Indians are still offline \nMore than 66% of India's 1.3 billion people still don't have access to the internet. The hundreds of millions set to come online over the next decade will likely do so through mobile devices. \n\"Mobile has already become the the primary device from which users access the internet,\" said Srivastava. \nUntil recently, connecting via mobile had been prohibitively expensive for most Indians but that is beginning to change thanks to a collapse in the price of data. \nIndia's wealthiest man, Mukesh Ambani, sparked a price war a year ago by offering new users six months free access to his Reliance Jio 4G network. The result: India now has some of the cheapest mobile data in the world. \nHigh-speed data plans are available for as little as 149 rupees ($2.30) a month. \nLanguages can unlock growth \nIndia has dozens of regional languages, and many of the country's newest mobile users are discovering the internet in one of them. \nIndia already has 234 million local language internet users, according to a recent report by Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) and KPMG. That number is expected to soar to 536 million by 2021. \n\"One of the major reasons the smartphone hasn't been able to penetrate rural or [smaller] cities is because it's all in English,\" said Srivastava. \"You need to have the regional languages, and a lot of players have understood that.\" \nIndian companies such as Indus OS are creating operating systems in multiple Indian languages. The Indus system is already being used by top homegrown brands such as Micromax. \n\"They are investing in putting regional languages in their smartphones, turning this challenge into a differentiating factor for themselves,\" he added. \nSpoiled for choice \nIndia has more than 100 smartphone brands catering to a variety of budgets. \nSamsung dominates with nearly 25% of the market, according to research firm IDC, but several domestic and international firms have managed to secure smaller but significant shares. \nIPhones are too expensive for most Indians (the average annual wage is around $1,900) but Apple recently started making select models in the country's tech hub Bangalorein the hope of offering a more competitive product. \nChinese manufacturers account for over half the Indian market, having made big inroads over the past year. \nSrivastava says India is more open to new entrants than China or the U.S., where Apple and Samsung already account for over 70% of the smartphone market, according to comScore. \n\"The barrier to entry is a lot less,\" Srivastava said. \"In India the smaller players do have a chance to grow.\" CNNMoney (New Delhi) First published September 26, 2017: 10:53 PM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "srivastava", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vivo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shobhit srivastava", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mukesh ambani", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indus os", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "counterpoint research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kpmg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangalore", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T06:18:21.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "237ac02b3ed869623ffd5c820e6b3e5996703a0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4IN_FCRRkIdRR8GB2Cv29LuHcPZRiEicmV50KAPBn4cfa53Hy3f7gevAYvzKsCsOswD4P91JyVP0OrAxjaHOSP1wqIlL0z2JV9H", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_freevideo", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Halloween decoration leads to 911 calls", "title_full": "Halloween decoration leads to 911 calls", "published": "2017-09-27T06:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926225525-halloween-decoration-ac-1-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 7, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 739, "comments": 0, "shares": 739}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "237ac02b3ed869623ffd5c820e6b3e5996703a0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4IN_FCRRkIdRR8GB2Cv29LuHcPZRiEicmV50KAPBn4cfa53Hy3f7gevAYvzKsCsOswD4P91JyVP0OrAxjaHOSP1wqIlL0z2JV9H", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T06:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Halloween decoration leads to 911 calls", "text": "MUST WATCH Halloween decoration leads to 911 calls A deputy was called to investigate a bloody scene in Tennessee that turned out to be a Halloween decoration.

Prosecutors said Tharpe stopped his wife and sister-in-law in the road as they drove to work, according to court records. He grabbed Freeman, his sister-in-law, from the vehicle and shot her before throwing her into a ditch and shooting her again, killing her. Then, prosecutors alleged Tharpe raped his wife and took her to withdraw money from a credit union, where she was able to call police for help, according to the documents.

According to his affidavit, Gattie said, \"In my experience I have observed that there are two types of black people: 1.

Gattie later said in a deposition that he did not intend to use the n-word as a racial slur, according to court documents. Weeks after the interview, Tharpe's attorneys returned to Gattie's home and read his statements back to him, periodically stopping to ask him if the statements were accurate, court documents say. Gattie had only one correction, but the rest of his statement stood, court documents filed by Tharpe's attorneys say. He signed the 1998 affidavit under oath.

But two days later, the state -- doing \"damage control,\" Kammer said -- came back to Gattie and had him sign a second affidavit that undercut his statements to Tharpe's attorneys, claiming Gattie was drunk at the time he made them. But, Kammer argues, \"he never denied that he in fact held the views that he stated in the initial testimony.\" More claims of constitional violations Gattie also said during jury selection he had no connection to Jacquelin Freeman's family. However, in the same affidavit in which he made the remarks in question, Gattie also admitted to knowing the Freemans.

They also argued Tharpe, has an IQ of about 70, which would make him ineligible for execution under federal law, which bars the death sentence for people with intellectual disabilities. Recent SCOTUS rulings could help Tharpe Georgia law states that juror testimony cannot be used to impeach the verdict, or render it invalid -- even if it involves racial bias, Kammer said. At the time Gattie made the statements in question, this rule kept Tharpe's attorneys from being able to use them to prove his death sentence was the result of racial bias. In Georgia, defendants can only receive a death sentence if the jury reaches the decision unanimously. Kammer and his team relied on recent United States Supreme Court decisions to support their motion for a stay of execution. The central one, Kammer told CNN, is Pena-Rodriguez v Colorado. In March, the US Supreme Court held in a 5-3 vote that laws like Georgia's are invalidated when a juror \"makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on racial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant,\" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion. Governor was right to stop condemned man's execution Essentially, a juror's racial bias constitutes a violation of a defendant's rights to an impartial jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, and prevents defendants from being able to prove a violation of their constitutional rights. \"A constitutional rule that racial bias in the justice system must be addressed -- including, in some instances, after the verdict has been entered -- is necessary to prevent a systemic loss of confidence in jury verdicts, a confidence that is a central premise of the Sixth Amendment trial right,\" Kennedy said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian kammer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gattie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tharpe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kammer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barney gattie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith tharpe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacquelin freeman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freeman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alito", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "us supreme court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "united states supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia resource center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pena-rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia department of corrections", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court of georgia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tharpe georgia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T06:24:42.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f82dbbf2ce822c09d33d5d80cc8ebae5bfaf07b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsCRKyCcRdUN3XPz3znFZ8eUtlIRT.ru8mBFQYoDCKXq6qqBGOdUY61wUKDxIXIXD.HKrJxkI8Hew-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - HP Hero", "title": "Supreme Court stays Georgia execution", "title_full": "Supreme Court stays Georgia execution", "published": "2017-09-27T06:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170922134437-01-keith-tharpe-mug-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4499, "comments": 0, "shares": 4499}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 11}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f82dbbf2ce822c09d33d5d80cc8ebae5bfaf07b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsCRKyCcRdUN3XPz3znFZ8eUtlIRT.ru8mBFQYoDCKXq6qqBGOdUY61wUKDxIXIXD.HKrJxkI8Hew-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T06:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Supreme Court stays Georgia execution", "text": "SCOTUS stays execution of Georgia death row inmate amid claims of racial bias By Dakin Andone and Emanuella Grinberg , CNN Updated 0457 GMT (1257 HKT) September 27, 2017 \nChat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Black folks and 2. \"N****rs.\" Gattie went on to say in his affidavit, \"I felt Tharpe, who wasn't in the 'good' black folks category in my book, should get the electric chair for what he did.\" As of 2001, Georgia carries out its executions by lethal injection. \"After studying the Bible, I have wondered if black people even have souls,\" Gattie said. Gattie later said in a deposition that he did not intend to use the n-word as a racial slur, according to court documents. Weeks after the interview, Tharpe's attorneys returned to Gattie's home and read his statements back to him, periodically stopping to ask him if the statements were accurate, court documents say. Gattie had only one correction, but the rest of his statement stood, court documents filed by Tharpe's attorneys say. He signed the 1998 affidavit under oath.

Hours after Mattis landed, the rockets were fired at Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport from an unknown location and landed in an open area, according to Najib Danish, spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry. He did not reveal how many rockets were fired. Mattis and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had already left the airport at the time of the incident, Danish said. No one was injured. The Taliban has claimed responsibility and said Mattis' plane was the target of the attack, the Taliban's spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, tweeted. Up to 40 rounds of munitions hit the airport, according to a US military official, 29 of which were rocket-propelled grenades. The nature of the other munitions was not immediately known. Read More The official said the munitions were fired toward a guard tower and hit the south side of the airport. An Afghan special forces unit responded to the attack, searching houses close to the airport on the suspicion that the rockets were fired from them, Danish added. A statement released by the international coalition in Afghanistan, Resolute Support, accused insurgents of \"using civilians as shield and cover\" and said that they \"detonated suicide vests\" which the coalition said endangered a great number of civilians. \"The Afghan Crisis Response Unit 222 responded quickly to confront the attackers and end the assault,\" the statement added, referring to the Afghan government's elite counterterrorism unit. The coalition also said that US aircraft supported the Afghan security operation with airstrikes, saying that one of the missiles used malfunctioned, causing several civilian casualties. \"Tragically, one of the missiles malfunctioned, causing several casualties,\" the statement said. It is unclear if the civilians were killed or wounded. \"Resolute Support deeply regrets the harm to non-combatants. We take every precaution to avoid civilian casualties, even as the enemies of Afghanistan continue to operate in locations that deliberately put civilians at very high risk,\" it added. Mattis' unannounced visit Wednesday was his first trip to the country since US President Donald Trump announced a new Afghan strategy in late August. At a press conference with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Stoltenberg, Mattis said he had only heard some press reports but said \"an attack on an airport anywhere in the world is a criminal act by terrorist.\" \"If, in fact, this is what they have done, they will find the Afghan Security Forces continuing on the offensive against them in every district of the country right now,\" Mattis added. Presidential meeting Mattis met with Afghan President Ghani at the Presidential Palace, alongside Stoltenberg and Gen. John Nicholson, commander of US forces in Afghanistan. Saying it was \"refreshing\" to be in the country alongside NATO's leader, he said a \"lot was riding\" on Trump's new strategy. \"A lot is riding on this of course as we look toward how do we put an end to this fighting and the threat of terrorism to the Afghan people, to the international community and how do we put this into a path of political reconciliation,\" he said. At the time, Trump said he was shifting the policy to take the emphasis off troop numbers, and would rely on greater regional cooperation to stabilize the security situation in Afghanistan. \"We are here to set the military and security conditions for that but recognize ultimately the responsibility for the Afghan leadership under your direction,\" Mattis added. Earlier Mattis met with key Afghan government officials, including Defense Minister Tariq Shah Bahrami and Interior Minister Wais Barmak, as well as Stoltenberg and Nicholson, at Resolute Support Headquarters. Nicholson gave an assessment of the fighting season so far, saying it had gone as well as can be expected. Stoltenberg also spoke at the meeting, reiterating NATO support for Afghan forces. \"We are ready to train, assist and advise. We would like to help you break the stalemate that we have seen,\" he said. During his visit, Mattis is also expected to meet with the and spend time with US troops. Later, he'll hold a press conference with Ghani and the NATO chief. US Secretary of Defense James Mattis touches down in Kabul, Afghanistan for a visit, Wednesday, 27 September. Last week, Ghani used a substantial part of his speech at the United Nations General Assembly to praise Trump's recently announced strategy for Afghanistan and South Asia. \"With President Trump's recent announcement of his strategy to counter terror and stabilize South Asia, Afghanistan's enduring partnership with the United States and the international community has been renewed and redirected,\" Ghani told the audience at the UN headquarters in New York. Afghan strategy In his August prime-time address, Trump outlined his plan for the war in Afghanistan, vowing that the US would \"fight to win\" while no longer \"nation-building.\" The President declared he would no longer announce troop levels but would focus on allowing US forces to target the Taliban and other terrorist groups wherever they were in Afghanistan. \"America's enemies must never know our plans, or believe they can wait us out. I will not say when we are going to attack, but attack we will,\" said Trump, before a crowd of US troops. There are approximately 11,000 US troops in Afghanistan, according to revised figures given by the Pentagon in late August. The number given was around 2,600 more than had been officially disclosed due to a change in its accounting procedures. Before entering office, Trump had campaigned for a complete withdrawal of US troops from the country. The 16-year war has claimed the lives of more than 2,200 US troops, as well as thousands of allied forces. Tens of thousands of Afghan civilians and military have also died in the conflict. Trump indicated in August that he'd changed his mind and said withdrawing from Afghanistan would dishonor those killed. Who are the key players in Afghanistan? Crackdown on Pakistan's 'harboring of terrorists' Trump's new Afghanistan plan also emphasized that it was a part of a broader South Asia strategy that relied on greater cooperation from neighboring India and Pakistan. He had particularly harsh words for Pakistan, saying Washington could \"no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organizations.\" Trump's Afghanistan plan", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james mattis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mattis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jens stoltenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "defense", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kabul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T06:41:48.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d65a243ac639df6ea7e4c67df7cd04e5b63dc0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INeY4Wq4XjWQaE6ijlQwJmJB4uGTKbzA0JajUY4XHUXjDIcbaEQWddrZ4s6PsUqhIG0PNy4LyzRCeo0chlmtIEVw--", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_freevideo", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com -

He did not reveal how many rockets were fired. Mattis and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had already left the airport at the time of the incident, Danish said. No one was injured. The Taliban has claimed responsibility and said Mattis' plane was the target of the attack, the Taliban's spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, tweeted. Up to 40 rounds of munitions hit the airport, according to a US military official, 29 of which were rocket-propelled grenades. The nature of the other munitions was not immediately known. Read More The official said the munitions were fired toward a guard tower and hit the south side of the airport. An Afghan special forces unit responded to the attack, searching houses close to the airport on the suspicion that the rockets were fired from them, Danish added. A statement released by the international coalition in Afghanistan, Resolute Support, accused insurgents of \"using civilians as shield and cover\" and said that they \"detonated suicide vests\" which the coalition said endangered a great number of civilians. \"The Afghan Crisis Response Unit 222 responded quickly to confront the attackers and end the assault,\" the statement added, referring to the Afghan government's elite counterterrorism unit. The coalition also said that US aircraft supported the Afghan security operation with airstrikes, saying that one of the missiles used malfunctioned, causing several civilian casualties. \"Tragically, one of the missiles malfunctioned, causing several casualties,\" the statement said. It is unclear if the civilians were killed or wounded. \"Resolute Support deeply regrets the harm to non-combatants. We take every precaution to avoid civilian casualties, even as the enemies of Afghanistan continue to operate in locations that deliberately put civilians at very high risk,\" it added. Mattis' unannounced visit Wednesday was his first trip to the country since US President Donald Trump announced a new Afghan strategy in late August. At a press conference with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Stoltenberg, Mattis said he had only heard some press reports but said \"an attack on an airport anywhere in the world is a criminal act by terrorist.\" \"If, in fact, this is what they have done, they will find the Afghan Security Forces continuing on the offensive against them in every district of the country right now,\" Mattis added. Presidential meeting Mattis met with Afghan President Ghani at the Presidential Palace, alongside Stoltenberg and Gen. John Nicholson, commander of US forces in Afghanistan. Saying it was \"refreshing\" to be in the country alongside NATO's leader, he said a \"lot was riding\" on Trump's new strategy. \"A lot is riding on this of course as we look toward how do we put an end to this fighting and the threat of terrorism to the Afghan people, to the international community and how do we put this into a path of political reconciliation,\" he said. At the time, Trump said he was shifting the policy to take the emphasis off troop numbers, and would rely on greater regional cooperation to stabilize the security situation in Afghanistan. \"We are here to set the military and security conditions for that but recognize ultimately the responsibility for the Afghan leadership under your direction,\" Mattis added. Earlier Mattis met with key Afghan government officials, including Defense Minister Tariq Shah Bahrami and Interior Minister Wais Barmak, as well as Stoltenberg and Nicholson, at Resolute Support Headquarters. Nicholson gave an assessment of the fighting season so far, saying it had gone as well as can be expected. Stoltenberg also spoke at the meeting, reiterating NATO support for Afghan forces. \"We are ready to train, assist and advise. We would like to help you break the stalemate that we have seen,\" he said. During his visit, Mattis is also expected to meet with the and spend time with US troops. Later, he'll hold a press conference with Ghani and the NATO chief. US Secretary of Defense James Mattis touches down in Kabul, Afghanistan for a visit, Wednesday, 27 September. Last week, Ghani used a substantial part of his speech at the United Nations General Assembly to praise Trump's recently announced strategy for Afghanistan and South Asia. \"With President Trump's recent announcement of his strategy to counter terror and stabilize South Asia, Afghanistan's enduring partnership with the United States and the international community has been renewed and redirected,\" Ghani told the audience at the UN headquarters in New York. Afghan strategy In his August prime-time address, Trump outlined his plan for the war in Afghanistan, vowing that the US would \"fight to win\" while no longer \"nation-building.\" The President declared he would no longer announce troop levels but would focus on allowing US forces to target the Taliban and other terrorist groups wherever they were in Afghanistan. \"America's enemies must never know our plans, or believe they can wait us out. I will not say when we are going to attack, but attack we will,\" said Trump, before a crowd of US troops. There are approximately 11,000 US troops in Afghanistan, according to revised figures given by the Pentagon in late August. The number given was around 2,600 more than had been officially disclosed due to a change in its accounting procedures. Before entering office, Trump had campaigned for a complete withdrawal of US troops from the country. The 16-year war has claimed the lives of more than 2,200 US troops, as well as thousands of allied forces. Tens of thousands of Afghan civilians and military have also died in the conflict. Trump indicated in August that he'd changed his mind and said withdrawing from Afghanistan would dishonor those killed. Who are the key players in Afghanistan? Crackdown on Pakistan's 'harboring of terrorists' Trump's new Afghanistan plan also emphasized that it was a part of a broader South Asia strategy that relied on greater cooperation from neighboring India and Pakistan. He had particularly harsh words for Pakistan, saying Washington could \"no longer be silent about Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organizations.\" Trump's Afghanistan plan Can Trump's plan actually work? Tillerson: 'Peace talks' part of strategy New troops to land in 'days' Five key pillars of Trump's plan Trump calls out Pakistan, India America's longest war READ Trump's full speech \n\"The Pakistani people have suffered greatly from terrorism and extremism,\" Trump said. \"Pakistan has also sheltered those same organizations that try every single day to kill our people.\" Afghan and US officials have long accused Pakistan of taking insufficient military action against Taliban leadership internally. Speaking at the UNGA last week, Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi rejected accusations the country hadn't done enough to combat terrorism. \"Having suffered and sacrificed so much due to our role in the global counter terrorism campaign it is especially galling for Pakistan to be blamed for the military or political stalemate in Afghanistan. We are not prepared to be anyone's scapegoat,\" he said. Abbassi added that Taliban \"safe havens\" were located not in Pakistan but in \"large tracts of territory controlled by the Taliban in Afghanistan.\" As of August last year, the Afghan government controlled only 64.4% of the country . Trump's Afghan strategy also calls for more help from India, which has long maintained strained relations with Pakistan. \"India makes billions of dollars in trade from the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan,\" Trump said. Mattis' visit to Kabul comes straight off the back of a visit to India. After meeting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the two released a statement saying \"both sides had reaffirmed their resolve to further develop their strong strategic partnership.\" The statement said they'd discussed greater cooperation on regional and global scale in pursuing their shared goals of \"peace, stability and combating terrorism.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mattis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "james mattis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ghani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashraf ghani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jens stoltenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john nicholson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "defense", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "united nations general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us forces", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kabul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south asia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T06:57:27.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e8c3bcc81c5895fa924cb72efd8ed79516d31691", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsuxI_hoO2Jeo1h13vavob6xFE7hKDUIhdFGsnhNAnLeIzZ.Xm0w.Egeg.lPzwTo2tDtTN_j8K29U-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - HP Hero", "title": "Restaurant report card: What's in your fast food meat?", "title_full": "Restaurant report card: What's in your fast food meat?", "published": "2017-09-27T07:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150914175529-11-chipotle-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6739, "comments": 0, "shares": 6739}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 22}, "linkedin": {"shares": 995}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e8c3bcc81c5895fa924cb72efd8ed79516d31691", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsuxI_hoO2Jeo1h13vavob6xFE7hKDUIhdFGsnhNAnLeIzZ.Xm0w.Egeg.lPzwTo2tDtTN_j8K29U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T07:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Restaurant report card: What's in your fast food meat?", "text": "Story highlights A new report on antibiotics in fast food gave 14 US chains passing grades, while 11 failed Panera and Chipotle led the pack for a third year in a row (CNN) Our favorite fast foods could come back to bite us, according to a report released Wednesday -- and it's not just the extra calories.\nThe new report grades the 25 largest US fast food chains on where they stand on antibiotics. The results are a mixed bag: For the third year in a row, the only two As were awarded to Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panera Bread. More companies passed this year than ever before. But 11 of the top 25 chains received an F, having taken \"no (discernible) action to reduce use of antibiotics in their supply chains.\" Nine companies didn't respond to the survey at all, just like last year. Read More \"These drugs have historically been given to animals that are not sick, to accelerate weight gain and prevent disease in crowded and unsanitary industrial farming conditions,\" wrote the authors, who come from six public interest groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council , Consumers Union and the Center for Food Safety. 5 things you need to know about antimicrobial resistance While regulations and consumer pressure have encouraged some chains to cut back on the use of antibiotics, some experts worry it's not enough to stave off development of \"superbugs\" that can't be killed by some of our current medicines. These bugs may get into our meat and produce . \"If we don't rein in this pattern of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, what we will see is half a century of medical progress reversed,\" said Lena Brook , a food policy advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council. She has served as a lead expert on the report for each of the past three years. Despite nearly half of restaurants receiving a failing grade, this is an improvement over the 16 that failed last year , the authors said. \"It's a rapid shift that we've seen in just a few short years, and that leaves me really hopeful,\" Brook said. Who passed, and who didn't? A total of 14 fast food and \"fast casual\" chains earned passing grades, a boost over nine last year. There were only five the year before that, in 2015. \"It is important to note, however, that while remarkable progress has been made to reduce or even eliminate use of medically important antibiotics, this progress has largely occurred in chicken production,\" the authors said. This is how Chipotle and Panera have stood above the rest: by making sure that pork and beef -- in addition to poultry -- are raised without antibiotics. \"While we are pleased to see others in our industry follow our lead in this important area, this report shows that there is still more work to be done across the industry,\" Chris Arnold, a Chipotle spokesman, said in an email. The credit for most improved goes to KFC , which jumped from an F last year to a B- after committing to phase \"medically important\" antibiotics out of its chicken supply by the end of 2018. Antibiotics are considered \"medically important\" for their use in humans, per the World Health Organization. Subway earned a B+ for working to curtail antibiotics in poultry and meat. However, its plan to do the same with pork and beef was far off in the future in comparison, keeping it from an A. Earnings Bs and Cs were Wendy's , Taco Bell and Chick-fil-A. All have made moves to reduce antibiotics in their chicken. McDonald's also earned a C+, just like last year. The company updated its \"Vision for Antibiotic Stewardship\" policy in August, saying it planned to pare down unnecessary antibiotic use in all meats. However, the company failed to give a timeline for pork and beef, the new report said. Pediatricians want farmers to use fewer antibiotics \"We remain committed to making meaningful reductions in the use of antibiotics in beef and pork and will share our progress on beef in 2018,\" Marion Gross , senior vice president for McDonald's North America supply chain, said in a statement. Pizza Hut \"made a token effort,\" the report authors said, receiving a D+ for creating policies that affected only a small portion of its chicken. Starbucks earned the same grade for pledging to address antibiotic use in poultry, but not pork or beef. Earning a D were four chains: Burger King , Dunkin' Donuts , Jack in the Box and Papa John's. These restaurants committed to limiting antibiotic use in some or all of their chicken. However, the companies' plans were unclear or, in the case of Papa John's, unverified by an outside auditor.

Hide Caption 15 of 15 So what? \"Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest health threats facing us today,\" says CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. \"We've taken too many drugs, and as a result, they don't work the way they used to.\" When animals get antibiotics, often in their food or drinking water, the drugs may kill a number of bacteria. But a handful might harbor a gene that makes them resistant to drugs. Those bacteria may survive, multiply and spread. The world is running out of antibiotics, WHO says These bugs \"can move off of farms,\" Brook said, \"and find their way into communities.\" They can even share their genes with weaker bacteria. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have repeatedly warned about the not-far-off public health threat of antibiotic resistance. The CDC estimates that at least 2 million Americans contract antibiotic-resistant infections every year and that 23,000 die as a result. And these infections are often longer, more costly and more serious, according to the CDC. The WHO cautioned in a 2014 report : \"A post-antibiotic era -- in which common infections and minor injuries can kill -- far from being an apocalyptic fantasy, is instead a very real possibility for the 21st century.\" Taking steps While some experts criticize the routine use of antibiotics, others defend the practice, saying that antibiotics play an important role in maintaining animal health and may prevent an entire herd of sick animals that require these drugs down the line. Despite the improvements detailed in the new report, Brook said it's unclear why there are so many \"holdouts\" with failing grades, many of whom did not answer the groups' questions. This STD is becoming 'smarter' and harder to treat \"These companies tend to have long-range contracts. Perhaps they're buying from recalcitrant producers,\" Brook suggested. With so much variation among the top chains, she said it \"points to the real need for federal policy to step in.\" The US Food and Drug Administration has taken steps to limit the use of some antibiotics in food animals. By January, animal drug manufacturers no longer allowed medically important antibiotics to be prescribed solely for growth purposes, according to the FDA. But this left open the possibility that these drugs could be used to routinely prevent disease, even if no animals were sick, so long as a veterinarian had written a prescription. This drew criticism that the FDA's efforts didn't go far enough. \"This represents a giant loophole in FDA guidelines, which effectively do little to stop the misuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture,\" the authors of the new report said. \"While the FDA believes the prevention use of antimicrobials in animal agriculture can play an important role in effectively managing animal disease, it is critical that such use be judicious,\" the agency said in a statement. Banned antimicrobial chemicals found in many household products The FDA recommends that these drugs only be given if \"there are no reasonable alternatives\" to prevent disease. It doesn't endorse giving these medications to \"apparently healthy animals in the absence of any information that such animals were at risk of a specific disease,\" the agency added. \"Because (the FDA's) initiative was not fully implemented until January 2017, it is too early to speculate on how this effort may impact antimicrobial use in the animal agriculture setting,\" the agency said of its plan, which launched in December 2013.

French high-speed train manufacturer Alstom ( ALSMY ) is merging with the transportation unit of Germany's Siemens ( SIEGY ) , the companies said in a statement late Tuesday. \nSiemens has been pursuing partners for its railway business, reportedly holding talks with Swiss manufacturer Stadler Rail and Canadian rival Bombardier ( BDRAF ) . \nThe deal was billed as \"a merger of equals,\" but Siemens will have majority control of the new company -- owning 50% plus a few shares. \nOther terms are designed to defuse a potential backlash in France, where there is likely to be opposition to one of the country's industrial jewels coming under German control. \nThe combined firm will be headquartered in Paris and led by Alstom CEO Henri Poupart-Lafarge. \nSiemens has agreed not to increase its stake in Alstom beyond 50.5% for four years, and it has provided \"certain governance and organizational and employment protections.\" \nShares in Alstom gained 6% on Wednesday, while Siemens added 2%. \nThe deal aims to counter China's growing clout in global rail markets. Beijing stepped up its efforts in 2015 by merging two big companies into state-backed giant CRRC, which describes itself as \"the world's largest supplier of rail transit equipment.\" \n\"The global marketplace has changed significantly over the last few years. A dominant player in Asia has changed global market dynamics,\" said Joe Kaeser, CEO of Siemens. \nRelated: The German economy has a weak link: Infrastructure \nCRRC has won major contracts to supply metro cars to Boston, Chicago, Melbourne and other cities.

The President is being forced to deny that his Twitter blasts and culture war shots at NFL players protesting racial grievances show that he's too distracted to lead amid creating political storms. \"I've heard that before, about was I preoccupied? Not at all, not at all. I have plenty of time on my hands. All I do is work,\" said Trump, when asked at a Rose Garden news conference whether his feud with NFL players had caused him to take his eye off the ball over the fast worsening hurricane crisis in Puerto Rico. Given the magnitude of issues he's facing, it was not surprising that Trump sometimes seemed to be flailing Tuesday, a day of upheaval that served as a microcosm of his turbulent eight months in power that has delighted his fans but rocked much of the rest of the nation and the world.

MUST WATCH \nVan Jones: Trump goes for cheap applause lines 06:49 Read More History shows that any hints of incompetence at a time of national security crisis can deal a devastating blow to a presidency. A sense that a White House is powerless, meanwhile, to control the political winds of Washington can be equally as damaging -- especially when a commander-in-chief is as polarizing as Trump. But the President, while flashing characteristic defiance, also showed hints of political self-awareness suggesting he understands the gravity of his political plight as intense pressures bear down on his White House. This White House, for all the loyalty of Trump's fervent political base, could soon find itself facing up to any of these realities if it allows the myriad crisis facing the President to spin any further out of control. Trump's critics, for instance, warn he's about to have a Katrina moment -- as questions mount over his handling of the Hurricane Maria disaster, as the desperate plight of Puerto Rican citizens begins to emerge. At the same time, he's taking the world closer to the brink with North Korea , exacerbating a nuclear crisis with no clear face saving exit for himself or dictator Kim Jong Un. And he took another blow on the chin on Tuesday night, when his favored candidate lost Alabama's Republican Senate primary to Roy Moore, an iconoclast who showed up to vote on horseback and who makes his own theatrics seem tame. Trump's administration and fellow Republicans meanwhile are staggering from yet another failure to use their monopoly on power to repeal Obamacare. And quietly, the Russia investigation, which has haunted the Trump presidency, marched on Tuesday, when it emerged that top White House officials face questioning from special counsel Robert Mueller's probe in the coming days. 'Tremendous reviews' JUST WATCHED Trump on Puerto Rico: Literally destroyed Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nTrump on Puerto Rico: Literally destroyed 02:17 The most immediate political threat to the White House is posed by the situation in Puerto Rico, with the island facing power blackouts, water and food shortages, and with its infrastructure of hospitals and basic services dark. If things get worse fast, the President may come to rue the self-congratulatory moment he created on Tuesday. \"As far as Puerto Rico is concerned ... we have had tremendous reviews from government officials, as we have in Texas and Louisiana,\" Trump told reporters. \"And this morning, the governor made incredible statements about how well we're doing,\" Trump said. His search for personal praise was characteristic, as was his effort Monday night in a tweet to pass blame for the island's current plight as he bemoaned its old infrastructure and debts. Trump did make the valid point that rushing hurricane relief to an island was a tougher proposition than relieving Texas and Florida after their recent monster storms. \"This is, you know, a thing called the Atlantic Ocean. This is tough stuff,\" he said. But the administration's frenetic activity Tuesday showed that it understands that if it does not get a handle on the situation quickly, Trump's response risks looking too small for the crisis. \"If the President doesn't grasp the severity of the situation this is going to be his legacy,\" Democratic Rep. Nydia Velazquez of New York warned. \"This is the most powerful country in the world, and this is how we treat our citizens?

Again, Trump defended himself and blamed others. Despite last week vowing to \"totally destroy\" North Korea if it kept threatening the US and its allies, and warning its leaders would not last long in a weekend tweet, Trump said Kim's behavior not his own, was to blame for soaring tensions. \"He's acting very badly. He's saying things that should never, ever be said. And we're replying to those things, but it's a reply. It's not an original statement, it's a reply,\" Trump said. The President also slammed previous administrations for leaving him a \"mess\" with North Korea. But Trump also reprised the bombastic rhetoric that is worrying US allies and key players in the crisis like China and Russia. \"If we take that option, it will be devastating -- I can tell you that -- devastating for North Korea. That's called the military option. If we have to take it, we will.\" Humiliating loss JUST WATCHED Trump: McCain 'no' vote is a slap in the face Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nTrump: McCain 'no' vote is a slap in the face 01:43 Trump is also dealing with his failure to rack up a single major legislative achievement. His misfire has raised questions about his own capacity to shepherd major agenda items into law. News that Republican senators would not vote on the latest last ditch bid to repeal Obamacare this week broke during Trump's news conference. The President has spent days raging at GOP lawmakers for their repeated failures to send him a bill. In a private dinner with conservative leaders on Monday , he fulminated at John McCain, one of the no votes who helped doom the bill. The Obamacare failure also means it is even more important for Republicans to carve out a win as they now turn to tax reform this week. But disarray in the party he leads has some wondering whether Republicans will be able ever to unite as a block to secure the kind of wins that Trump promised his supporters he would be tired of by now. The multiple challenges bearing down on his administration help explain why Trump is showing such relish in prosecuting his feud with the NFL. As he battles to persevere his relevance in Washington, the President needs his loyal political base more than ever. That's especially true because he's contemplating a deal with Democrats on protections for young immigrants to follow his debt ceiling agreement with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer -- not to mention his backing for the establishment candidate in Alabama, Luther Strange. So wrapping himself in the flag -- and tweaking racial tensions -- makes political sense and shows why he thinks it's worth obsessing over, despite everything else that's going on. \"I wasn't preoccupied with the NFL.

The results are a mixed bag: For the third year in a row, the only two As were awarded to Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panera Bread. More companies passed this year than ever before. But 11 of the top 25 chains received an F, having taken \"no (discernible) action to reduce use of antibiotics in their supply chains.\" Nine companies didn't respond to the survey at all, just like last year. Read More \"These drugs have historically been given to animals that are not sick, to accelerate weight gain and prevent disease in crowded and unsanitary industrial farming conditions,\" wrote the authors, who come from six public interest groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council , Consumers Union and the Center for Food Safety. 5 things you need to know about antimicrobial resistance While regulations and consumer pressure have encouraged some chains to cut back on the use of antibiotics, some experts worry it's not enough to stave off development of \"superbugs\" that can't be killed by some of our current medicines. These bugs may get into our meat and produce . \"If we don't rein in this pattern of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, what we will see is half a century of medical progress reversed,\" said Lena Brook , a food policy advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council. She has served as a lead expert on the report for each of the past three years. Despite nearly half of restaurants receiving a failing grade, this is an improvement over the 16 that failed last year , the authors said. \"It's a rapid shift that we've seen in just a few short years, and that leaves me really hopeful,\" Brook said. Who passed, and who didn't? A total of 14 fast food and \"fast casual\" chains earned passing grades, a boost over nine last year. There were only five the year before that, in 2015. \"It is important to note, however, that while remarkable progress has been made to reduce or even eliminate use of medically important antibiotics, this progress has largely occurred in chicken production,\" the authors said. This is how Chipotle and Panera have stood above the rest: by making sure that pork and beef -- in addition to poultry -- are raised without antibiotics. \"While we are pleased to see others in our industry follow our lead in this important area, this report shows that there is still more work to be done across the industry,\" Chris Arnold, a Chipotle spokesman, said in an email. The credit for most improved goes to KFC , which jumped from an F last year to a B- after committing to phase \"medically important\" antibiotics out of its chicken supply by the end of 2018. Antibiotics are considered \"medically important\" for their use in humans, per the World Health Organization. Subway earned a B+ for working to curtail antibiotics in poultry and meat. However, its plan to do the same with pork and beef was far off in the future in comparison, keeping it from an A. Earnings Bs and Cs were Wendy's , Taco Bell and Chick-fil-A. All have made moves to reduce antibiotics in their chicken. McDonald's also earned a C+, just like last year. The company updated its \"Vision for Antibiotic Stewardship\" policy in August, saying it planned to pare down unnecessary antibiotic use in all meats. However, the company failed to give a timeline for pork and beef, the new report said. Pediatricians want farmers to use fewer antibiotics \"We remain committed to making meaningful reductions in the use of antibiotics in beef and pork and will share our progress on beef in 2018,\" Marion Gross , senior vice president for McDonald's North America supply chain, said in a statement. Pizza Hut \"made a token effort,\" the report authors said, receiving a D+ for creating policies that affected only a small portion of its chicken. Starbucks earned the same grade for pledging to address antibiotic use in poultry, but not pork or beef. Earning a D were four chains: Burger King , Dunkin' Donuts , Jack in the Box and Papa John's. These restaurants committed to limiting antibiotic use in some or all of their chicken. However, the companies' plans were unclear or, in the case of Papa John's, unverified by an outside auditor.

Hide Caption 15 of 15 So what? \"Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest health threats facing us today,\" says CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. \"We've taken too many drugs, and as a result, they don't work the way they used to.\" When animals get antibiotics, often in their food or drinking water, the drugs may kill a number of bacteria. But a handful might harbor a gene that makes them resistant to drugs. Those bacteria may survive, multiply and spread. The world is running out of antibiotics, WHO says These bugs \"can move off of farms,\" Brook said, \"and find their way into communities.\" They can even share their genes with weaker bacteria. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have repeatedly warned about the not-far-off public health threat of antibiotic resistance. The CDC estimates that at least 2 million Americans contract antibiotic-resistant infections every year and that 23,000 die as a result. And these infections are often longer, more costly and more serious, according to the CDC. The WHO cautioned in a 2014 report : \"A post-antibiotic era -- in which common infections and minor injuries can kill -- far from being an apocalyptic fantasy, is instead a very real possibility for the 21st century.\" Taking steps While some experts criticize the routine use of antibiotics, others defend the practice, saying that antibiotics play an important role in maintaining animal health and may prevent an entire herd of sick animals that require these drugs down the line. Despite the improvements detailed in the new report, Brook said it's unclear why there are so many \"holdouts\" with failing grades, many of whom did not answer the groups' questions. This STD is becoming 'smarter' and harder to treat \"These companies tend to have long-range contracts. Perhaps they're buying from recalcitrant producers,\" Brook suggested. With so much variation among the top chains, she said it \"points to the real need for federal policy to step in.\" The US Food and Drug Administration has taken steps to limit the use of some antibiotics in food animals. By January, animal drug manufacturers no longer allowed medically important antibiotics to be prescribed solely for growth purposes, according to the FDA. But this left open the possibility that these drugs could be used to routinely prevent disease, even if no animals were sick, so long as a veterinarian had written a prescription. This drew criticism that the FDA's efforts didn't go far enough. \"This represents a giant loophole in FDA guidelines, which effectively do little to stop the misuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture,\" the authors of the new report said. \"While the FDA believes the prevention use of antimicrobials in animal agriculture can play an important role in effectively managing animal disease, it is critical that such use be judicious,\" the agency said in a statement. Banned antimicrobial chemicals found in many household products The FDA recommends that these drugs only be given if \"there are no reasonable alternatives\" to prevent disease. It doesn't endorse giving these medications to \"apparently healthy animals in the absence of any information that such animals were at risk of a specific disease,\" the agency added. \"Because (the FDA's) initiative was not fully implemented until January 2017, it is too early to speculate on how this effort may impact antimicrobial use in the animal agriculture setting,\" the agency said of its plan, which launched in December 2013. Before the FDA's announcement, around 70% of \"medically important\" antibiotics were used in farm animals, not humans, according to data by the FDA and QuintilesIMS.

Not at all, not at all. I have plenty of time on my hands. All I do is work,\" said Trump, when asked at a Rose Garden news conference whether his feud with NFL players had caused him to take his eye off the ball over the fast worsening hurricane crisis in Puerto Rico. \nGiven the magnitude of issues he's facing, it was not surprising that Trump sometimes seemed to be flailing Tuesday, a day of upheaval that served as a microcosm of his turbulent eight months in power that has delighted his fans but rocked much of the rest of the nation and the world. \nHistory shows that any hints of incompetence at a time of national security crisis can deal a devastating blow to a presidency. A sense that a White House is powerless, meanwhile, to control the political winds of Washington can be equally as damaging -- especially when a commander-in-chief is as polarizing as Trump. \nBut the President, while flashing characteristic defiance, also showed hints of political self-awareness suggesting he understands the gravity of his political plight as intense pressures bear down on his White House. \nThis White House, for all the loyalty of Trump's fervent political base, could soon find itself facing up to any of these realities if it allows the myriad crisis facing the President to spin any further out of control. \nTrump's critics, for instance, warn he's about to have a Katrina moment -- as questions mount over his handling of the Hurricane Maria disaster, as the desperate plight of Puerto Rican citizens begins to emerge. \nAt the same time, he's taking the world closer to the brink with North Korea , exacerbating a nuclear crisis with no clear face saving exit for himself or dictator Kim Jong Un. \nAnd he took another blow on the chin on Tuesday night, when his favored candidate lost Alabama's Republican Senate primary to Roy Moore, an iconoclast who showed up to vote on horseback and who makes his own theatrics seem tame. \nTrump's administration and fellow Republicans meanwhile are staggering from yet another failure to use their monopoly on power to repeal Obamacare. \nAnd quietly, the Russia investigation, which has haunted the Trump presidency, marched on Tuesday, when it emerged that top White House officials face questioning from special counsel Robert Mueller's probe in the coming days. 'Tremendous reviews' \nThe most immediate political threat to the White House is posed by the situation in Puerto Rico, with the island facing power blackouts, water and food shortages, and with its infrastructure of hospitals and basic services dark. \nIf things get worse fast, the President may come to rue the self-congratulatory moment he created on Tuesday. \n\"As far as Puerto Rico is concerned ... we have had tremendous reviews from government officials, as we have in Texas and Louisiana,\" Trump told reporters. \n\"And this morning, the governor made incredible statements about how well we're doing,\" Trump said. \nHis search for personal praise was characteristic, as was his effort Monday night in a tweet to pass blame for the island's current plight as he bemoaned its old infrastructure and debts. \nTrump did make the valid point that rushing hurricane relief to an island was a tougher proposition than relieving Texas and Florida after their recent monster storms. \n\"This is, you know, a thing called the Atlantic Ocean. This is tough stuff,\" he said. \nBut the administration's frenetic activity Tuesday showed that it understands that if it does not get a handle on the situation quickly, Trump's response risks looking too small for the crisis. \n\"If the President doesn't grasp the severity of the situation this is going to be his legacy,\" Democratic Rep. Nydia Velazquez of New York warned. \"This is the most powerful country in the world, and this is how we treat our citizens? Shame on us.\" \nAs pressure mounted, the White House released pictures of Trump in a Situation Room meeting on the crisis. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke and FEMA administrator William Brock appeared outside the West Wing to hurriedly brief reporters on the progress of the relief effort. \nTrump meanwhile announced he would go to Puerto Rico next Tuesday. War fears \nAs he grappled with the rising recriminations of the hurricane, Trump also had to defend his handling of the standoff with North Korea, as critics warn that his bellicosity is making the situation worse. \nAgain, Trump defended himself and blamed others. \nDespite last week vowing to \"totally destroy\" North Korea if it kept threatening the US and its allies, and warning its leaders would not last long in a weekend tweet, Trump said Kim's behavior not his own, was to blame for soaring tensions. \n\"He's acting very badly. He's saying things that should never, ever be said. And we're replying to those things, but it's a reply. It's not an original statement, it's a reply,\" Trump said. \nThe President also slammed previous administrations for leaving him a \"mess\" with North Korea. \nBut Trump also reprised the bombastic rhetoric that is worrying US allies and key players in the crisis like China and Russia. \n\"If we take that option, it will be devastating -- I can tell you that -- devastating for North Korea. That's called the military option. If we have to take it, we will.\" Humiliating loss \nTrump is also dealing with his failure to rack up a single major legislative achievement. His misfire has raised questions about his own capacity to shepherd major agenda items into law. \nNews that Republican senators would not vote on the latest last ditch bid to repeal Obamacare this week broke during Trump's news conference. \nThe President has spent days raging at GOP lawmakers for their repeated failures to send him a bill. In a private dinner with conservative leaders on Monday , he fulminated at John McCain, one of the no votes who helped doom the bill. \nThe Obamacare failure also means it is even more important for Republicans to carve out a win as they now turn to tax reform this week. \nBut disarray in the party he leads has some wondering whether Republicans will be able ever to unite as a block to secure the kind of wins that Trump promised his supporters he would be tired of by now. \nThe multiple challenges bearing down on his administration help explain why Trump is showing such relish in prosecuting his feud with the NFL. \nAs he battles to persevere his relevance in Washington, the President needs his loyal political base more than ever. \nThat's especially true because he's contemplating a deal with Democrats on protections for young immigrants to follow his debt ceiling agreement with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer -- not to mention his backing for the establishment candidate in Alabama, Luther Strange. \nSo wrapping himself in the flag -- and tweaking racial tensions -- makes political sense and shows why he thinks it's worth obsessing over, despite everything else that's going on. \n\"I wasn't preoccupied with the NFL. I was ashamed of what was taking place,\" he said. \"Because to me, that was a very important moment.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "william brock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elaine duke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nydia velazquez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan scavino jr.", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west wing", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T08:11:58.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b0633da0e93f007c7c021b7f3b88dd08879c97df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INEbowu7zbSrSoaSxjBPW94Q5VwuPxqIdDKC7P4jqc9..5bVoXyc42_7tdwc.IZt7pYV8_XZzaMAxbantnX4eN3Lu8ykcyQfsMnoyfl5G4XLM-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Singapore clip 3 - CNN Video", "title_full": "Singapore clip 3 - CNN Video", "published": "2017-09-27T01:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b0633da0e93f007c7c021b7f3b88dd08879c97df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INEbowu7zbSrSoaSxjBPW94Q5VwuPxqIdDKC7P4jqc9..5bVoXyc42_7tdwc.IZt7pYV8_XZzaMAxbantnX4eN3Lu8ykcyQfsMnoyfl5G4XLM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T01:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "Singapore clip 3 - CNN Video", "text": "\nChat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Luther Strange win Montgomery, Alabama (CNN) All the Republican establishment's money and muscle couldn't stop culture warrior Roy Moore from ousting Sen. Luther Strange here Tuesday night. Now, suddenly, other outsider candidates see a much bigger opening to make Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a villain and turn the party on its head in the 2018 midterms. \"This shows it can be done,\" said Danny Tarkanian, who is challenging Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada's Republican primary. \"It shows the amount of money McConnell and his super PACs put in the race can't change the feeling that voters have right now.\" Moore's victory comes at an uncertain moment for GOP lawmakers, donors and operatives. The party's stumbles on Capitol Hill have fed into a growing frustration with its leadership, and Moore's win underscores the vulnerability of incumbents such as Heller and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake. Another possible target, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, announced his retirement Tuesday. For all the right-wing insurgency's bluster -- and despite its efforts in places like neighboring Mississippi in 2014 and Arizona last year -- a sitting GOP senator had not been toppled in a primary since Indiana's Richard Lugar in 2012. Moore win, Corker retirement give McConnell a rough day Read More Some in the White House and in McConnell's camp were sure that President Donald Trump's campaign stop for Strange here Friday night, coupled with the $10 million that a Mitch McConnell-aligned super PAC poured into the race, could stave off the insurgency again. But Moore's side countered with support from Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist in Trump's White House who now sees himself as the chief tormenter of Senate Republican incumbents. RELATED: Roy Moore's incredible journey and controversial beliefs \"You're going to see, in state after state after state, people that follow the model of Judge Moore that do not need to raise money from the elites,\" he said at Moore's victory party Tuesday night. For both Trump -- whose tweets supporting Strange were apparently deleted Tuesday night -- and the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund super PAC, Tuesday's outcome offered a stark glimpse at the limits of their influence. \"The days have come to an end where the muscle and money from the majority can push through candidates in this new political environment,\" said Matt Schlapp, the American Conservative Union chairman who attended a Monday night dinner where Trump quizzed influential right-wing figures about the race. The millions spent on TV ads propping up Strange were wasted, Schlapp said, because they only emphasized that Strange was McConnell's candidate. \"The messenger is the message. And if the messenger lacks credibility, then the message will lack credibility,\" Schlapp said. As for Strange, he said, \"He was Mitch's boy and he was the governor's boy.\" The Bentley factor The central theme of Alabama's Senate race has been anti-establishment backlash. And it began before there even was a race. Strange was Alabama's attorney general when he was tapped by then-Gov. Robert Bentley to temporarily fill the seat of Sen. Jeff Sessions, after he was picked to be attorney general, until the state could hold a special election. But Bentley was awash in a sex scandal that would soon force him out of office . And Strange's potential role in prosecuting Bentley opened the door to questions about whether the two had struck some sort of deal to spare the governor from criminal charges. Governors gone bad: Alabama's Bentley latest on a long list When Moore and Rep. Mo Brooks entered the race in the spring, they made pointed reminders of how Strange had gotten the job a centerpiece of their campaigns. \"The cement had been poured on Luther Strange because of the former governor,\" said Mississippi-based veteran Republican operative Austin Barbour. \"That was probably the biggest issue in this race for months -- that voters in Alabama were so upset with Robert Bentley,\" Barbour said. \"And anybody that they associated with Robert Bentley, they didn't want anything to do with.\" Early signs of trouble for Strange Moore -- a figure whose relationships within the Alabama Republican Party span decades, and whose support from the evangelical grassroots is difficult to match -- surged in the summer, headed into the mid-August primary. Two positive tweets and a robocall from Trump were enough to net Strange 33% in the primary. But Moore won 39% -- pushing the two into the runoff held Tuesday. Quickly, the third-place primary finisher Brooks' district in northern Alabama became a battleground. Moore secured Brooks' endorsement fewer than two weeks from election day. \"We are in an epic battle between the people of Alabama who put America first and the Washington swamp that hopes to buy our Senate seat and put America last,\" Brooks told Republicans in Huntsville. Hours later, Trump announced he would hold a rally in Alabama -- a state that carries psychic importance to the President, dating to an early 2016 campaign rally that drew tens of thousands. Trump touts 'Big Luther's' loyalty, electability at Alabama rally Trump had been urged by some advisers inside and outside the White House against wading into a race where private polls showed Moore ahead. And, speaking to an adoring crowd with many Trump-Moore voters on Friday night, the President candidly acknowledged the reality on the ground. \"I'll be honest, I might have made a mistake,\" Trump said. Moore shuts the door Throughout his campaign, Moore was careful to campaign only against McConnell -- not Trump. He seemed to take the attack ads personally, complaining about them in interviews and at every rally. Though he'd dodged the question early in the campaign, by its end, Moore was campaigning on a pledge to oust McConnell as Senate majority leader. Moore twisted the knife in a Thursday night debate, just days before the election, which took place with no moderator. Armed with opposition research notes, Moore attacked Strange for being a lobbyist and for McConnell groups' spending. Then, he turned to Bentley -- asking Strange whether he had made a deal with the former governor and noting it again when Strange didn't directly respond. Meanwhile, in Washington, Bannon had spent weeks urging conservative groups to rally around Moore -- as well as Tarkanian, conservative Flake challenger Kelli Ward and other anti-establishment candidates. He ordered Breitbart.com, where he has returned as a top executive, to pour its energy into the race, amping up Moore endorsements from figures like Sarah Palin. Sen. Jeff Flake: Trump 'inviting' 2020 primary challenge by how he's governing Bannon was on hand himself Monday night to close out Moore's campaign . He'd also invited Nigel Farage, the British \"Brexit\" figure. The two told Moore's supporters that they were there to help Trump -- by rejuvenating his movement with a shot across McConnell's bow. \"They think you're a pack of morons. They think you're nothing but rubes,\" Bannon said there. \"They have no interest at all in what you have to say, what you have to think or what you want to do. And tomorrow, you're going to get an opportunity to tell them what you think of the elites who run this country.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "luther strange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff flake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt schlapp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barbour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mo brooks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelli ward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dean heller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah palin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "strange moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luther strange win montgomery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob corker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigel farage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schlapp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bentley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tarkanian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert bentley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin barbour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell-aligned", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danny tarkanian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard lugar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama republican party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump's white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american conservative union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huntsville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T08:44:27.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c21aaf9edef64834ee88d91e8b2b508281df58f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKY_HftsmmvrRVT2NAGCX23X3H4F3kMWvJCVHXxi7jl_6SZ8PmTzNl0mO822z7TWvmvmff8gly1Q2", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Trump's tweet supporting Luther Strange deleted", "title_full": "Trump's tweet supporting Luther Strange deleted - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170922224906-trump-luther-strange-09-22-2017-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5572, "comments": 0, "shares": 5572}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c21aaf9edef64834ee88d91e8b2b508281df58f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKY_HftsmmvrRVT2NAGCX23X3H4F3kMWvJCVHXxi7jl_6SZ8PmTzNl0mO822z7TWvmvmff8gly1Q2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Madison Park", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trump's tweet supporting Luther Strange deleted", "text": "Story highlights Three tweets on Trump's account endorsing Luther Strange were deleted Tuesday night Trump's post congratulating Moore, remained visible on his Twitter account (CNN) President Donald Trump's most recent tweets urging Alabamians to vote for Sen.

He ordered Breitbart.com, where he has returned as a top executive, to pour its energy into the race, amping up Moore endorsements from figures like Sarah Palin. Sen.

You wanted the truth about Jack's death, \"This Is Us\" fans. But can you handle the truth? In the first episode of the sophomore season, \"This Is Us\" unveiled a huge piece of the \"How did Jack die?\" puzzle in a flashback to the night of his death. In the scene, a distraught Rebecca (Mandy Moore) sobbed in her car parked in front of the Pearson house, which was burned down to its frame, indicating Jack's death is somehow related to a house fire. Before you ask, no, this isn't a misdirect. \"That is the cause of his death,\" \"This Is Us\" creator Dan Fogelman told CNN at a party following the show's Los Angeles premiere screening. \"[The fire] is directly responsible.\" Read More Still, many pieces of this puzzle remain unsolved. For example, leading up to the reveal of the burned house, viewers saw Rebecca, wearing a Steelers shirt, driving with a bag of Jack's belongings in her passenger seat. Does this mean Jack made it to the hospital? And what was the status of Jack and Rebecca's marriage at the time of the fire? RELATED: 'This Is Us' cast breaks down season finale's unexpected turns In the season premiere, Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) admitted to his wife that he had a drinking problem, and Rebecca vowed to see him through it. The flashback also hinted at major developments in the lives of teenage Kate, Kevin and Randall. Kate, for example, had a dog, Randall had a girlfriend and Kevin had broken his leg . Fogelman promised all these small details will add up to a final picture that will fully explain the events leading up to Jack's end, but it will be \"a slow-burning mystery.\" \"Hopefully, we've given people enough that they can focus on the show -- understand the big piece and, now, be watching a little bit of an onion unpeel as you see things ensue in the course of the [season],\" he said. Secret's out The final minutes of the premiere were the result meticulous planning. In fact, what fans saw in the Season 2 premiere was \"very much the plan since [the show's] inception,\" Fogelman said. \"Milo, Mandy, Sterling [K. Brown], Justin [Hartley], Chrissy [Metz] -- they've all known since day one of shooting that this is what happened. They kind of knew this is how the first episode of the second season would start,\" he said. Keeping the deadly fire a secret this long has not been easy. When filming the all-important burned house scene about a week and a half ago, the \"This Is Us\" team traveled several hours out of Los Angeles in hopes of keeping it under wraps. They built a replica of the Pearson house, used code words and kept anything relating to the show hidden from public view as much as possible. Fogelman estimates it was six months of planning total. Though, he admitted in a panel after the screening, filming took mere minutes, as Moore emotionally delivered what they needed in the first take. \"She's so good,\" he said. With the secret out in the open, Fogelman said he's breathing a little easier. \"The big thing we were protecting was [Tuesday night's episode], and now it's out there and I'm less worried,\" he told CNN. Mandy Moore as Rebecca on \"This Is Us.\" The fire theory had been one of many floated by \"This Is Us\" fans since the mystery of Jack's death was built up in Season 1. Easily the most popular theory had Jack dying in an automobile-related incident, a hypothesis born from one scene in particular last season, involving young Kate and drunk driving Jack. \"We had a moment in our second to last episode where Kate reveals \u2014 which is very much at the core of our story \u2014 that she feels responsible for her dad's death as he gets into a car drunk to drive, and there was some blowback that we misdirected the audience,\" he said. \"In our minds, it was something that happened. Jack did drive having drank that night, and she does feel responsible for her father's death, which is something we're going to see this season. But I understand that could have felt a little bit manipulative. That wasn't our intention.\" So this season, they're being extra \"careful,\" he said. \"Everything that has been said on the show regarding Jack, everything that they've seen [Tuesday night], is not a fake-out,\" he promised. \"People will see it.\" Also in store? Some major singing moments from grown-up Kate (Metz), more from Randall (Brown) and Beth's (Susan Kelechi Watson) adoption journey, a guest appearance from Sylvester Stallone and a deeper dive into what made Jack a loving, caring father and husband. \"There's always a darker sided to the lighter side,\" Ventimiglia teased. \"There are reasons why he does these things and that's what we're going to unpack.\" \"This Is Us\" airs Tuesdays on NBC.

You might want to look away now -- especially if you're on a roller coaster. Because, says theme park expert Stefan Zwanzger, that device in your hand is destroying the very thing you're supposed to be enjoying. And he claims to have the photos to prove it. Zwanzger, AKA The Theme Park Guy , has spent the past decade exploring parks in more than 150 countries. On a recent return journey to locations he visited in 2010 in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, he was struck by how once joyful places were now filled with unhappy-looking people unable to stop staring at their screens. Photos taken in 2017 , when compared with similar shots from seven years earlier reveal, he says, the extent to which phones are causing the \"zombification of the human spirit.\" Glum faces Zwangzer's 2010 images show smiles. In 2017 it's dull faces transfixed by devices. If smartphones are spoiling places where people are supposed to unplug themselves and embrace the fun, he argues, then they've already spoiled everything else. \"It's a warning,\" he tells CNN. \"When you see people holding phones in front of their face even in theme parks, you can be sure they also do it on public transport, at dinner with their family, in bed, on the toilet and who knows maybe in the shower, too. \"A theme park is supposed to distract you from real life, grab your attention, enchant you, accelerate you, splash you... If you still can't let go of that thing, not even then, that probably means you use it for 10 or 12 hours per day.\" Zwanzger's 2010 images show smiling park visitors enjoying the sights and interacting with each other. In 2017, glum faces are almost uniformly transfixed by their devices. \"The teenagers should be looking around, being curious. The boys and girls are supposed to be checking each other out, like they always did, but they're completely hypnotized,\" he says.

There's a tendency to see this a little more in developed economies in Asia, because that part of the world has always been more techie and gadget-loving. But it really isn't an Asian phenomenon only, you also see it in Europe, America and elsewhere. \"Not so much in Africa. There are some really amazing places, such as small amusement parks in Ethiopia, where people are present and in a really good mood and you still feel like you're in the photos from 2010.\" The images will do little to ease concerns over the impact our devices are having on some aspects of modern life -- from sleep patterns to child development . Zwanzger, who claims no regrets about being smartphone-free for more than a year, says these scenes have depressing social implications for today's kids. His thoughts are echoed by Jean Twenge , professor of psychology at San Diego State University and the author of \" iGen: Why Today's Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy -- and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood .\" Twenge says the years since 2010 have been marked by statistical rises in teen depression and suicide rates plus a decline in levels of happiness and life satisfaction, something possibly reflected in Zwanzger's photos. \"Obviously it's not researched, but it's a very interesting piece of anecdotal evidence, because it does do one thing that scientific studies try to do, which is control variables,\" she says. \"It's the same situation, two different years.\" MORE: 15 of the world's happiest places 'Sweet spot' Twenge advocates limited use of smartphones. Youngsters without access to devices can be unhappy, she says, as can those overusing. \"Don't have it in your hand the entire time, limit your use to a few hours a day,\" she says. \"That's the sweet spot for happiness, at least in the data on teens.\" Zwanzger says theme parks should seize an opportunity to offer people an escape from an increasingly connected world. \"They should become offline parks where you hand over your phone and you and your family are forced to deal with each other and enjoy the here and now,\" he says. \"It would be like a dive into the past, something special. Disneyland, too, offers visitors an escape into the past, with a romanticized American Main Street, German castles, car-free life... but in the end that's just buildings.\" If theme parks were to focus now on virtual reality, augmented reality and media based attractions only, he adds, they could risk their own futures. \"It's a completely different world in just seven years. Look at the photos from 2010, they have energy and you say, 'oh yes, that could be fun.'

They kind of knew this is how the first episode of the second season would start,\" he said. Keeping the deadly fire a secret this long has not been easy. When filming the all-important burned house scene about a week and a half ago, the \"This Is Us\" team traveled several hours out of Los Angeles in hopes of keeping it under wraps. They built a replica of the Pearson house, used code words and kept anything relating to the show hidden from public view as much as possible. Fogelman estimates it was six months of planning total. Though, he admitted in a panel after the screening, filming took mere minutes, as Moore emotionally delivered what they needed in the first take. \"She's so good,\" he said. With the secret out in the open, Fogelman said he's breathing a little easier. \"The big thing we were protecting was [Tuesday night's episode], and now it's out there and I'm less worried,\" he told CNN. Mandy Moore as Rebecca on \"This Is Us.\" The fire theory had been one of many floated by \"This Is Us\" fans since the mystery of Jack's death was built up in Season 1. Easily the most popular theory had Jack dying in an automobile-related incident, a hypothesis born from one scene in particular last season, involving young Kate and drunk driving Jack. \"We had a moment in our second to last episode where Kate reveals \u2014 which is very much at the core of our story \u2014 that she feels responsible for her dad's death as he gets into a car drunk to drive, and there was some blowback that we misdirected the audience,\" he said. \"In our minds, it was something that happened. Jack did drive having drank that night, and she does feel responsible for her father's death, which is something we're going to see this season. But I understand that could have felt a little bit manipulative. That wasn't our intention.\" So this season, they're being extra \"careful,\" he said. \"Everything that has been said on the show regarding Jack, everything that they've seen [Tuesday night], is not a fake-out,\" he promised. \"People will see it.\" Also in store? Some major singing moments from grown-up Kate (Metz), more from Randall (Brown) and Beth's (Susan Kelechi Watson) adoption journey, a guest appearance from Sylvester Stallone and a deeper dive into what made Jack a loving, caring father and husband. \"There's always a darker sided to the lighter side,\" Ventimiglia teased. \"There are reasons why he does these things and that's what we're going to unpack.\" \"This Is Us\" airs Tuesdays on NBC.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin [hartley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rebecca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventimiglia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "k. brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susan kelechi watson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chrissy [metz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pearson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milo ventimiglia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sylvester stallone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan fogelman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "randall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fogelman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steelers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T09:41:24.003+03:00"}], "totalResults": 7673, "moreResultsAvailable": 7573, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=1eee5ef1-4d51-497e-9e88-ed86353bcda9&format=json&ts=1506494484003&q=language%3Aenglish+site%3Acnn.com&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 975}
