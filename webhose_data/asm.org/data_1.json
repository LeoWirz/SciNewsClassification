However, working in the lab also provides opportunities to develop and demonstrate skills that you can transfer to a variety of professional contexts\u2014these are called transferable skills. Read on to explore four transferable skills: 1. Initiative and Enterprise When have you shown it in the lab? You stare at your data, day in and day out. There\u2019s just one experiment missing before you can put the pieces together and determine the mechanism behind your phenotype. You analyze paper after paper and draw every diagram you could possibly think of to describe the data you have to date. Then\u2026..Eureka! You found it! You quickly run back to the lab to plan and conduct the vital experiment that will fill the missing pieces of your mechanism. Why is it transferable? Scientists consistently demonstrate entrepreneurial initiative. They see a problem and strategize creative and unique approaches in order to address that problem. Industries often thrive from developing and executing creative solutions to gaps or problems, and you already do this every time you design an experiment! 2. Risk Management When have you shown it in the lab? Your super-creative experiment may provide the answer that you\u2019ve been waiting for, and while you are filled with excitement, you still perform due diligence to design your experiment very carefully. Did you perform that diagnostic digest before your next cloning step? I bet you did. Why? Because you know how to reduce unfavorable outcomes by being preemptive. Your laboratory training has taught you that you cannot assume that a restriction digest worked to completion until you can see the digest on a gel. There are many other instances where you have designed targeted interventions in your experiments to make sure that your protocols work, and that your data is usable. In other words, you know how to identify and reduce risks. Why is it transferable? Risk management is key to managing projects in the workplace because it allows you to minimize factors that can be detrimental to your desired outcomes. So don\u2019t be startled when an interviewer asks you how you manage risk. Just remember that you\u2019ve been doing it all along! 3. Negotiation When have you shown it in the lab? Uh oh, you forgot to sign up for that machine you need to do an important experiment. Your colleague, who signed up for the machine for two hours more than they probably needed, will still need some convincing to work with you. But you have developed quite a repertoire of negotiation skills throughout your time in the lab. You approach your colleague and brainstorm ways that you can help to streamline their sample preparation, reducing the overall time that they need on that machine! Why is it transferable? Negotiation is pivotal to ensuring organizational productivity, equitable outcomes, and conflict resolution. Through your laboratory training, you have demonstrated an ability to analyze problems, devise solution-based outcomes, and empathize with the needs of your colleagues. 4. Pitching When have you shown it in the lab? You finished your key experiment and the data looks great! You think you found a mechanism for your earlier phenotype. The data is nicely analyzed and rigorously repeated. Your Powerpoint slides look stellar. At this point, you will present your findings to either a committee to defend your dissertation, to investigators during your annual department meeting, or to a lab meeting of your supervisor and colleagues. You are confident in your results, but why should the audience believe you? To test you, every piece of data that you present is followed by a question from the audience. Even the sight of a raised hand might make you doubt your findings at times. Nevertheless, you persevere. You answer confidently and persuasively, because you have been trained to review the scientific literature, analyze your data, and identify the shortcomings and limitations of your work. You know how to pitch your mechanism and back it up. Why is it transferable? Effective pitching allows companies to convince investors to fund their work. Whether you start your own business, work in venture capital, or find yourself needing to justify any professional endeavor, you need to leverage your experience in perfecting your pitch. Convince your corporate audience that you developed a unique solution to a problem or need, just as you did routinely during your laboratory research. Thinking of transferable skills can often be a daunting task, especially when you are applying for jobs that seem way out of your league. But take a moment and really look at the job description. Have you used those \u201crequired skills\u201d in the lab before? You probably have, so convince those hiring managers that you can make the connection. \nAre you interested in writing for ASM?

From Houston to Florida and now Puerto Rico, 12 hurricanes continue to highlight how vulnerable we are to natural disasters, which are undoubtedly exacerbated by climate change. While I hope we as a society are able to provide basic aid to those in need, we also have to ensure providing assistance to the students, trainees and future generations of scientists in these affected areas. Of imminent concern are the students, fellows, and scientists in Puerto Rico. \nPuerto Rico, a ~ 3,500 square mile island harboring ~3.4 million people that has been part of the USA for over a century and in which every citizen is American, was recently battered by hurricane Maria. The magnitude of the disaster remains to be fully tallied, as the island is currently without water, electricity or phone services, and many parts of Puerto Rico are flooded or under danger of flooding, delaying access for repair crews. The island will certainly need serious help in order to rebound. The Puerto Rican government estimates that it will take about six months to restore electricity to the entire island, which seems to be an optimistic assessment. While I hope the island will be helped by our government and generous donations alike, as a Puerto Rican microbiologist I ask that we scientists come together as a group to specifically assist our colleagues in the universities on the island. \nLike many of my Puerto Rican colleagues, my love for science and microbiology is rooted in the lectures and laboratory courses I took as an undergraduate in Puerto Rico. The strong foundation instilled in me by my professors back then still provide s the drive and passion I have today. However, education on the island has suffered from a decade-long recession and budget cuts, a declining condition that has now been further exacerbated by hurricane Maria. Masters and Ph.D. students will be seriously affected, as their research programs will have to come to a full stop for the foreseeable future. As we know, science is a very fluid endeavor and has no regards for natural disasters like Maria. In order to ensure scientific continuity in Puerto Rico, we need to put on our thinking caps and try to come up with potential solutions to help our colleagues and future scientists on the island. \nFor those of you who trained talented and hardworking students from Puerto Rico in your labs, I suspect you will recall how enthusiastically they contributed to your program; I propose that it is time to \"pay it forward.\" I urge the members of our great American Society for Microbiology and university chairs and program directors to aggressively explore ways to ensure that Puerto Rican scientists have the help they need in order to overcome this major disaster. Potential solutions include hosting students and scientists in our laboratories during the ongoing semester or providing direct aid to relief and reconstruction efforts at the universities. Microbial ecology highlights the importance of communities, and it seems appropriate to apply this concept to the U.S. and Puerto Rico: a strong community of willing scientists can ensure that the \"isla del encanto\" (\"island of enchantment\") gets all of the necessary support to keep science in Puerto Rico alive. \n\nVictor Torres, PhD \nDr. Victor J.

How does it first get inside its host cell? Are there preferred entry pathways, and if so, how does the pathogen rank them? These are questions addressed by first author Selasi Dankwa and senior scientist Manoj Duraisingh in their recently published Infection and Immunity article. \n\nIAIJournal: Genetic evidence for erythrocyte receptor glycophorin B expression levels defining a dominant Plasmodium falciparum invasion pathway in to human erythrocytes. \nBecause getting inside the red blood cells is such an important step in the malaria infection cycle, there are a number of pathogen receptors for different cell ligands, and some of these receptor-ligand interactions are well characterized. Other interactions, such as that between P. falciparum Erythrocyte Binding-Like 1 (EBL-1) and red blood cell glycophorin B (GPB), are less understood. The authors investigated this interaction by genetic knockdown of the erythrocyte glycophorin receptors to better characterize the GPB role during invasion. Table summarizing invasion efficiency in different genetic knockdown cell lines relative to controls. Source . \nThe scientists first generated individual knockdown of one of three glycophorin proteins GPA, GPB, and GPC in hematopoetic stem cell precursors, decreasing the surface protein levels by at least 80%. These cell lines were differentiated into erythrocytes and tested for P. falciparum invasion using both lab-adapted strains and field isolates. Both types of P. falciparum showed less cell invasion when the red blood cells expressed lower levels of GPB, and in some cases, GPB knockdown inhibited invasion more than knockdown of either GPA or GPC, two additional glycophorin proteins that act as malaria receptor ligands (see table, right). This suggests that some strains use GPB preferentially to enter their host cells. \nUnderstanding the hierarchy of invasion mechanisms used by malaria strains can lead to more effective treatments to block invasion. In all strains, knockdown of GPC conferred the least invasion defects, suggesting this receptor is not the preferred entry pathway and blocking this receptor will not prevent malaria infections. A more effective strategy would be to concentrate on blocking GPA and GPB interactions with their cell ligands, perhaps by screening for natural invasion-inhibitory antibodies, as found for other malaria receptors , in malaria-endemic areas. \nThe authors also analyzed a previously published set of transcriptome data from malaria-infected and otherwise healthy children from Benin in West Africa, to better understand this host-microbial interaction. They found that glycophorin B transcript levels vary more widely in healthy children than most erythroid cell-specific transcripts [Aside: do red blood cells, which lose their nucleus during differentiation, have transcripts? Indeed they do .]. These expression level differences may have been selected for in populations exposed to malaria for many generations, suggest the authors, but further studies are needed to confirm and understand the significance of this variation.

Escape mutations are strongly selected for by their effect on viral fitness, which is most often related to issues of protein folding, particle assembly, and capsid function. The studies presented here demonstrated that a broadly neutralizing antibody to mouse norovirus binds to an exposed... Abimbola O. Kolawole , Hong Q. Smith , Sophia A. Svoboda , Madeline S.

In this study, we investigated two proteins encoded by the copper export operon: the repressor, CopY, and the copper chaperone, CupA. Zinc suppressed transcription of the copper export operon by increasing the affinity of CopY for DNA. Furthermore, CupA was able to chelate... Miranda J. Neubert , Elizabeth A.

Probably a lot of plastic Maybe your old electronic device you threw away Wouldn\u2019t look quite the same though US history museums have many old tools Like iron cannons, big black and lumpy Always wonder what they looked like new But iron artifacts can be found much older than that Despite being tough, iron susceptible to chemical corrosion Oxygen creates rust, various iron oxides If chlorine in environment, acidic ferric chloride can form and eat away Several ways currently to try to recover artifacts Chemical treatment: alkaline sulfide Lets chlorine ions come out and reduces corrosion But slow and tricky to measure progress Electrolyte reduction \u2013 redox treatment, removes corrosion Harsh and significant loss of mass Also produces hydrogen, explosive Plasma treatment doesn\u2019t do much about chlorine, just creates cracks in corrosion layer Would be nice to have better ways What\u2019s new: Now, Lucrezia Comensoli, Julien Maillard, Monica Albini, Frederic Sandoz, Pilar Junier, and Edith Joseph, with Wafa Kooli, publishing in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, have developed an interesting new treatment strategy, using mineral-eating bacteria! Microbes considered in other types of conservation/restoration of artifacts Breaking down nitrate/sulfate crusts on stone, self-healing concrete by mineralization Removing organic matter from frescoes Forming protective layer on copper So why not iron? Many microbes manipulate iron for energy or as nutrient Iron is mostly in insoluble form in presence of oxygen Siderophores solubilize and bring inside cells Some bacteria can access solid iron too; must be transferring electrons out of cells Here's Dr. Junier describing their thinking regarding microbes: 2 Methods: Chose to study Desulfitobacterium hafniense Anaerobic, very versatile in electron acceptors it can use Nitrate, sulfite, metals, humic acids, halogenated organic compounds Esp interesting cos of reducing iron Grew D. hafniense with soluble iron in presence of chlorine ions, in form of NaCl (salt) Saw some iron reduced in control with no cells; probably reducing agent added to remove O But with cells, even more iron reduced beyond control amount Actually about all added was reduced color of solution changed from orange (rust) to black (reduced iron) So chloride doesn\u2019t interfere Good for soluble iron, but what about solid? Put bacteria with mineral called akaganeite, synthetic, mix of Fe, O, Cl Worst kind of corrosion found on artifacts Here, control had not much improvement But with cells, lots of iron reduced Synthetic akaganeite is too pure; artifacts have other elements mixed in Next tested rusty pieces of steel Took these pieces and let sit outdoors for a while until corroded Red-color like rust, Fe+O, with atoms of silicon, carbon, aluminum, and calcium No-cells control turned black yellow (probably cos of the reducing agent) D. hafniense, at least one of two strains tested, turned it grey Mostly covered with crystals mostly Fe, O, and C, and some P, S, Mg, Ca Chemical testing showed abiotic stuff was called mackinawite (Fe S) and some C Cells\u2019 crystals were mostly vivianite, Iron phosphate. And elemental sulfur and some others Nice and stable iron compound Then final test, actual corroded archaeological objects! Roman nails, prepared for treatment by sandblasting like normal Dr. Joseph tells an amusing story about acquiring these nails: 6 Started with brown-red color with orange spots, iron and oxygen No-cell controls had no change; corrosion too established/stable But with bacteria, nails turned dark-grey, could see clusters of crystals Magnetite and vivianite, dark grey and blue colors Covered whole surface after 3-7 days Summary: Iron-reducing bacteria in this study converted damaging rust and corrosion on iron objects into more stable and desirable forms Applications and implications: Could be very useful for archaeology As Edith said, already demand for process in museums and such Though process needs tweaking: magnetite color is ok but blue vivianite not as acceptable This process could be more desirable than chemical methods, as Dr. Junier explains: 5 Though I'm not sure how results compare exactly; certainly takes a lot less time But it could also be useful for other purposes, not just archaeology. Here's Dr. Joseph: 4 What do I think: Very cool to use microbes for this purpose They are powerful chemists though, so makes sense Often microbes are problematic for what they do to metals instead of helpful Nice to see them helpful instead There are some tricky limitations to applying this to larger artifacts, though. Here's Pilar again: 7 Edith and Pilar have some interesting ideas of applying and developing this work in the future: 8,9 Transcript statements: 2 So the general reason we go into bacteria or fungi, depends on the topic, is because we believe they are the best chemists on the planet, and then you can, by understanding their metabolism, apply that metabolism for particular problem or concern, like corrosion in this case. 4 So of course, the main issue of this project is how we can preserve the heritage, and this is of course important for the next generation. But we can also see some application in other domain and field of society. For example, iron is also used for pipeline and different many architectural part, and for this it can also be preserved. 5 now we have turned to trying to find alternatives to many treatments that are done currently more in chemical or industrial way, and we are trying to use microbes to replace these in what is so-called green chemistry, and that's at the end how can this type of research can build back into society. 6 The first time when I remember when I come to museum asking if I can have some object to make some treatment with some bacteria and fungi, they just told me, \"Are you crazy? We don't want any bacteria here!\" So it was quite, now they are quite demanding, so it's funny to see how they change their mind. 7 And also more in general, for us when we develop something in the laboratory, obviously our constraints are relatively small, because we know what we want to achieve. But it is easy to put a Roman nail inside a culture bottle, but it's not the same if you try to do this with a cannon or with any type of artifact that is larger than one or two centimeters. 8 So in this case, as Pilar say, we mainly develop actually in the lab, and what we would like to do is pursue this research, but in this case we've an in situ treatment and in particular involves some conservator ... that can give us their feedback and how they can be used as a protocol in the museum. 9 I think what is really interesting is this whole general idea has built basically Edith's and from the beginning she was very into bringing the final practitioner right into research so they can tell us what are the limitations, what are the conditions, if they understand the protocols, and that will lead us to real kits ready to use in the future.

The most common fungal genus causing human infections, Candida , grows quite quickly in culture and most species can be readily identified by standard methods. Some Candida species may even be identified with a rapid direct blood assay developed recently . For many of the other common fungi, however, culture may be low-yield or, even when successful, very slow. It is not uncommon for pathogenic molds to take from several days to weeks to grow, and fungal cultures are commonly held for 3-4 weeks for this reason. While culture has value in that it can provide a definitive identification, and potentially allow for antifungal susceptibility testing, let\u2019s explore some of the fungal laboratory tests that can be ordered while you wait for that culture. Stains/Morphology Fungal hyphae seen by Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) stain of tissue from a left ventricular assist device attachment site. Courtesy M. Pettengill. One of the first results a provider receives back from the lab is microscopy with a morphologic description. A fungal stain with Calcofluor White performed on direct patient specimens in the microbiology laboratory will detect virtually any pathogenic fungi when present in sufficient abundance, and many pathogenic fungi can be detected with a Gram stain. Common stains such Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or other specialized stains are performed in the histopathology or cytology lab on FFPE. Morphologic description on histopathology or cytology may provide one of the first clues: yeast, budding yeast, hyphae, or other more specific features may be noted. While the morphology may help narrow the differential (e.g., narrow, septate hyphae or broad ribbon-like hyphae), definitive identification is seldom possible. For a detailed review on this topic, please see \u201c Histopathologic Diagnosis of Fungal Infections in the 21st Century \u201d. Direct fluorescent antibody microscopy assays are widely used for Pneumocystis jirovecii , and one was noted to perform well relative to a molecular assay . While immunohistochemistry has found broad application for viral pathogens, this technique has not gained a foothold for fungal diagnostics, largely due to issues related to cross-reactivity. Fungal antigen tests Cryptococcus is a prominent cause of opportunistic respiratory and CNS infections in immunocompromised patients. Cryptococcus actually grows fairly well in culture, but there are excellent antigen tests (latex agglutination or enzyme immunoassays) available in most clinical microbiology labs that can give same day results. The antigen test may be performed using either cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum, and comparison of several cryptococcal antigen tests some time ago demonstrated their high sensitivity/specificity. Additionally, Cryptococcus is included in a meningitis syndromic PCR panel. There are also antigen tests for the dimorphic fungi Blastomyces , Histoplasma , and Coccidioides that can be performed on serum or urine. Unlike the cryptococcal antigen tests, however, antigen tests for dimorphic fungi are generally only available at specific reference labs and suffer from cross-reactivity with other dimorphic fungi that reduces their specificity. Because the dimorphic fungal pathogens have relatively restricted geographical distributions in the United States, a combination of antigen testing and travel history may work reasonably well; both Histoplasma and Blastomyces antigen tests should be considered if the patient is from an area where both are known to occur. 1,3-\u03b2-D-glucan is a constituent of the cell wall for many clinically relevant fungi, and may be detected in serum or plasma during invasive fungal infections. Unfortunately, the specificity of tests for 1,3-\u03b2-D-glucan is limited for a variety of reasons, including that this antigen is also produced by some species of bacteria ( including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae ) and may enter circulation through the use of some therapeutic agents or devices. The clinical utility of tests for 1,3-\u03b2-D-glucan is a matter of debate , but the attraction ofa non-invasive and rapid test that may help avoid or guide antifungal treatment for a critically ill patient is very understandable. 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan elevation is a good predictor of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in immunocompromised patients, especially in the specific setting of AIDS patients with respiratory symptoms , Galactomannan is another fungal cell wall compound that may be detected in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to assist in the evaluation of potential invasive fungal infections. The most commonly used serum galactomannan assay is often referred to as the \u201c Aspergillus antigen test\u201d \u2013 not surprising in that galactomannan is produced by Aspergillus . Aspergillus is one of the most common fungal pathogens in immunocompromised patients, and Aspergillus is actually part of the product name. Such a name should be used with caution, however, as other fungal pathogens that may cause similar symptoms, and appear similar in fungal stains, produce galactomannan, including Fusarium , Paecilomyces , Alternaria , Histoplasma capsulatum , and Talaromyces ( Penicillium ) marneffei . Galactomannan is also a common component of many food products , and there is some concern that mucositis or GI injury can lead to translocation of galactomannan from the GI tract to the blood and potentially cause false positive test results. A large Cochrane review meta-analysis of 54 studies that evaluated a serum galactomannan assay to aid in diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients found considerable heterogeneity of results among the studies. The \u201ccut-off\u201d value for test positivity also had a considerable impact on test performance \u2013 at a cut-off test result of 0.5 the sensitivity and specificity were 78% and 85%, respectively, whereas at a cut-off of 1.5 the sensitivity and specificity were 63% and 93%. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens may also be evaluated for galactomannan. Tests for 1,3-\u03b2-D-glucan and galactomannan can be performed quickly (same day if available in your local lab, longer if sent to reference lab) and provide additional information regarding potential invasive fungal infection, but the results need to be interpreted cautiously. Serology While there have been attempts to develop diagnostic serological assays (detecting patient antibodies for a specific organism / antigen) for many of the common fungal pathogens (such as Aspergillus ), these have not generally performed well as diagnostic tools due to the high rate of exposure to these organisms in the general population. For some of the more rarely encountered organisms, notably the dimorphic fungi, serological tests are available. In general, sensitivity of serologic tests for dimorphic fungi lags behind that of antigen tests, but serologic testing for Coccidioides is reasonably effective, and the performance of several serological Coccidioides assays has been compared , finding that utilizing multiple serological testing modalities (complement fixation, immunodiffusion, ELISA) may be necessary for immunocompromised patients. Some reference laboratories also offer serologic test panels for this purpose. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs)/Sequencing There are quite a few molecular tests available for fungal culture isolates, but for our purposes we will consider a scenario where information is needed before culture results are available. It\u2019s worth noting that extracting DNA from fungal cells can be challenging due to the fungal cell wall, and special nucleic acid isolation protocols need to be employed to improve success. There have been a lot of research efforts and laboratory developed tests (LDTs) using molecular methods targeted at fungal pathogens, especially for Aspergillus , but as of yet there are few FDA-cleared or widely employed assays. Perhaps the most utilized direct-from-specimen fungal NAATs in labs today are LDTs for the detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii . A NAAT panel for molds was evaluated for use with direct clinical specimens with mixed results . A complicating factor in the development of analytically sensitive (low limit of detection) fungal NAATs is that fungi are ubiquitous in the environment, and contamination is a major concern. Host carriage of low levels of Aspergillus or Pneumocystis may not be uncommon either. Broad-range PCR and sequencing is another currently utilized method for attempting to identify fungi in clinical specimens, including both fresh tissue samples and even formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. The concept is that PCR is directed at a genetic target with highly conserved \u201cbook-end\u201d primer sites (to provide the broad range) and a central region with enough variability to allow sequence-based identification of the amplicon source. Such targets for fungi include 28s rDNA or, more commonly, the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (this is a similar concept to 16s sequencing utilized for bacteria). For some genera, such as Aspergillus , additional targets may need to be added to achieve species-level identification. Sometimes a surgical or biopsy specimen is sent only to the surgical pathology laboratory (in formalin) because there was no suspicion of an infectious etiology, but histopathology reveals hyphae \u2013 what can be done? While FFPE processing leads to considerable degradation of nucleic acid, broad-range PCR may still be attempted, albeit with somewhat lower yield than for fresh specimens. Some hospital labs are developing the capacity to perform this type of testing as an LDT, although this is still primarily in the reference lab domain. Typically, receiving results back from a reference lab for this type of testing will take several days to a week. You may have seen at ASM Microbe 2017 a study evaluating next-generation sequencing of nucleic acid in plasma as a method to detect fungal pathogens without an invasive procedure, but as of yet there are very little data on the clinical performance of this type of assay, and the cost of the test is quite high. Summary A variety of non-culture based methods exist for the detection of fungal pathogens, although most of the results must be interpreted cautiously. Sequencing and other molecular technologies may become more mainstream in the coming years, but as of yet there remains considerable room for improvement in fungal diagnostics. If you feel there is an important fungal testing concept that wasn\u2019t covered above, please join in the conversation below. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aspergillus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galactomannan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calcofluor white", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "histoplasma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "candida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cochrane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m. pettengill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "penicillium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alternaria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T19:21:10.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "039a75f3e7d7bc069093bc7ff3d063c440b6cce8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRv.qG5SbvLJvqDl6llpmEms7Cq1CXWJ8hcy4_gDunCSx4ZZVliTdlxZ_R2cK.XNK99QZIc25YJOBaTY7Kr8TJG1zELvckQgX71u6JkZJCOlJ5oYkx80w_efO5ZRE3ju_LYxZyO0SaKbDT.jQlGRq..", "site_full": "www.asm.org", "site": "asm.org", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["computer_certification", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Finding Your Way in Academia: An interview with Dr. Valerie Horsley", "title_full": "Finding Your Way in Academia: An interview with Dr. Valerie Horsley", "published": "2017-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.159, "main_image": "https://www.asm.org/media/k2/items/cache/9bcaabc43439a4efb2b0c8e0f1ab1548_M.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20454, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "039a75f3e7d7bc069093bc7ff3d063c440b6cce8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRv.qG5SbvLJvqDl6llpmEms7Cq1CXWJ8hcy4_gDunCSx4ZZVliTdlxZ_R2cK.XNK99QZIc25YJOBaTY7Kr8TJG1zELvckQgX71u6JkZJCOlJ5oYkx80w_efO5ZRE3ju_LYxZyO0SaKbDT.jQlGRq..", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adriana Bankston", "published": "2017-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Finding Your Way in Academia: An interview with Dr. Valerie Horsley", "text": "Wednesday, 11 October 2017 15:29 Finding Your Way in Academia: An interview with Dr. Valerie Horsley DISQUS_COMMENTS \nDr. Valerie Horsley is an Associate Professor of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology at Yale University. Her academic career has been extremely successful, and she has made numerous contributions to the fields of wound healing and stem cell biology. She is also vocal about equality in academia and keeping a positive lab environment , which was highlighted in an episode of Yale\u2019s Spectrum Podcast. The podcast inspired this interview below, where she talks about navigating academia and mentoring students in the lab. \nWhat was your path to your current position? \nI\u2019ve been interested in science since I was 12 years old and knew that I wanted to do biology. In college, I enjoyed helping peers learn about their classes and became interested in teaching at a small liberal arts school. During my first year of graduate school at Emory University, I realized that I didn\u2019t have much research experience or an in-depth molecular biology background, but I had to do a research project and teach simultaneously. This further solidified my interest in teaching\u2014I liked how you can learn about biology by explaining it to other people. I also developed an interest in research because I liked discovering new, exciting things. I wanted to run my own lab and teach so I did a postdoc at Rockefeller University and then got a job at Yale to do both. \nMy lab is working on tissue homeostasis and regeneration. In particular, we are interested in the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control the maintenance and repair of epithelial tissues like the skin and mammary gland. We are determining the function of stromal cells, the cells supporting epithelial cells in these tissues, and also studying the role of immune cells and adipocytes in the regeneration and homeostasis of epithelial tissues. \nWhat does it take to be a successful academic scientist? \nIt takes a lot of resilience. You begin to build this resilience when your experiments fail every day. Once you have your own lab you fail at bigger things like grants and papers, so you need a lot of stamina and personal strength to keep going. You also need to recruit and mentor people who are good at doing science and are also resilient. \nA successful investigator needs to learn how to balance multiple roles and prioritize. As a postdoc, you spend most of your time doing research. But when you run your own lab, you wear many different hats: you are building a research team, mentoring, writing grants and papers, and sitting on committees. You need to use multiple skills that you don\u2019t necessarily practice or have training in before you start your lab. It\u2019s imperative to be proactive in asking for what you need and to get advice from experts in different fields. \nWhat should trainees who wish to pursue an academic career path think about? \nI tell my trainees that \u201cyou have to focus on what is most important at your career stage\u201d\u2014for example, as a graduate student or postdoc you need to publish papers, otherwise you won\u2019t have a career in academia. At the same time, you should think about your career options outside of academia and explore them to find your true passion and see if you can create a path that is independent of research. I tell my trainees that \u201cyou can\u2019t prepare yourself if you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s for.\u201d If you enjoy another career more, then you shouldn\u2019t go into academia. Through it all, remember to maintain a balance between your research and outside activities by folding other things into the downtime between your experiments. \nNetworking is also important, and doing it at different events is not very time consuming. You should get help from other people. For example, think about how you might get advice on mentoring people as a junior faculty. You would meet with other people who have been doing it for a while, talk to them about it, and over time you will get experience in that area and become an expert. \nHow do you mentor graduate students and postdocs? \nYou have to find your own mentoring style. When I first started mentoring, I asked myself \u201cCan I be like this or that mentor?\u201d and compared myself to my previous advisors. I realized that I couldn\u2019t pull off certain things my previous mentors did and wondered whether that was \u201cthe only way.\u201d I also wondered how I could motivate my students, especially given all the issues involved in doing research (including failed experiments)? I\u2019ve been very inspired by Uri Alon , who says that when you are going into an unknown (like research) and don\u2019t know the answers to questions, you feel afraid\u2014but that\u2019s where the magic happens. He calls it being \u201cin the cloud,\u201d and this is where we should be supporting people instead of being critical of them (which also applies to research). This is different from what people usually experience in science. But it is also in line with my personality, which is very optimistic and positive. \nEvery project has a process\u2014first you have to be critical about what the question is based on, and then you start exploring. You have to pick the right experiments and do the best science, and this is the stage where people need more support than critique. This is where the philosophy of being more supportive \u201cin the cloud\u201d comes into play, where teaching them to think about why something isn\u2019t working, rather than criticizing them for it not working. When you are writing manuscripts, you again have to be critical of the data, the story, and the conclusions. \nThere is a historical hierarchy in science that I don\u2019t agree with. I treat the people in my lab as future colleagues and show them respect by how I interact with them. I do step into the mentor/boss role if necessary, but that\u2019s less needed if I think of them as colleagues from the beginning. If they are not fulfilling my expectations, it could be a mismatch between them and the lab culture or my mentoring style, or they may not be inspired by the work we do in my lab or by research in general. They might be more interested in other things, and in that case, they shouldn\u2019t be doing research. I don\u2019t take it personally, and I help them be successful in another environment. Scientists are not trained to think about why people aren\u2019t doing well and how to help them find something better. \nHow do you keep a positive atmosphere in your lab? \nI am selective about the people I allow to work in my lab. I only want people with a positive impact, and I ask what current lab members think about potential lab members. During one-on-one meetings, I practice the supportive process, \u201cin the cloud\u201d, and try to be a cheerleader instead of being negative and critical. In lab meetings, we have activities to help us plan career priorities and positively think about each other. We also have events every year, like a gift exchange in December, rope climbing, kayaking, and lab lunches to build a team culture in the lab. \nWhat do you enjoy most about academia? \nI enjoy the flexibility of making my own schedule and deciding what to spend my time on. I enjoy doing service work like sitting on committees that address diverse, university-wide efforts like improving child care at Yale. I also like working with students and seeing them grow into independent scientists. I enjoy building something from scratch\u2014starting with an empty lab, building teams/projects, gathering data, publishing, and giving talks on my work. \nHow can we improve the environment in academia? \nWe have a culture problem in science, and that includes harassment and intimidation. There is the idea that if you don\u2019t have certain experiences, you won\u2019t be successful, but what does that really mean? The idea that you have to work 100 hours a week to succeed in academia adds to the intimidation factor but is a myth, because the number of hours worked is not a reflection of success. There are also a lot of subtle cultural things, like the idea that you need to be mean when critiquing others, but you can ask the hard questions in a respectful way. Also, there is the notion that academia is a golden star that everyone should attain causes unnecessary stress and tension. There are other careers that make people happy, and they need to know what the options are. \nWe need to help people not be afraid all the time. I try to change the culture in my lab, and hope the people I train will incorporate some of the things I teach them. I help students at Yale by doing seminars on resilience and not being afraid. A lot of the cultural changes at the university have to come from faculty and leaders. Trainees can also impact the culture by creating innovative programs or participating in mentoring groups. We also need more community building, and it\u2019s sometimes harder for trainees to approach faculty members about these issues. \nWe also need to make science more attractive to women and underrepresented groups by providing support. I initiated the Women in Science at Yale ( WISAY ) postdoctoral mentoring group, which is dedicated to promoting the interests of women in STEM, supporting women scientists, and advocating for gender equality in all fields. There is a lot of evidence that building positive relationships can have an impact on people and make them feel they aren\u2019t alone, so I would recommend having monthly meetings with faculty members and other postdocs. Simple things like happy hours, coffees, or any other way to bring people together to talk about science or nonscience issues helps. \nWhat do you think is the biggest challenge in science today? \nDefinitely funding, because it impacts what you do, the culture of the lab, and the stamina of the people in the lab. Constantly getting rejections can affect the amount of innovative thinking you can do. Science funding was at 30% when I was in grad school, and now it\u2019s very different. The amount of time and effort I spend writing grants is different, and don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily helping science even if it\u2019s essential for doing research. I also feel like I can\u2019t get enough money to do all the science I want to do, and that\u2019s very frustrating because I could do more research with more money. Like with anything, I will continue to be resilient. \nif you would like to share your career! \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "valerie horsley", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "uri alon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yale university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emory university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "developmental biology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rockefeller university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T18:21:54.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "982ebd2a40e9d97f619696c77a546bc9f6e54d6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRv.qG5SbvLJvqDl6llpmEmjnsSUo.41q_Rq37yC8tboq78U9FHY1niC54lii2jmOq2646fV5UWNPIACAJwwik7TI8OLytBXKFJtdu07LbnGjRp30IglhHHA41O.e6RkwI-", "site_full": "www.asm.org", "site": "asm.org", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["computer_certification", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Gut Fungi Could Play a Role in Obesity Epidemic", "title_full": "Gut Fungi Could Play a Role in Obesity Epidemic", "published": "2017-10-11T18:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.02, "main_image": "https://www.asm.org/media/k2/items/cache/236e0cbada492c3c0a22e59215775515_M.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20454, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "982ebd2a40e9d97f619696c77a546bc9f6e54d6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRv.qG5SbvLJvqDl6llpmEmjnsSUo.41q_Rq37yC8tboq78U9FHY1niC54lii2jmOq2646fV5UWNPIACAJwwik7TI8OLytBXKFJtdu07LbnGjRp30IglhHHA41O.e6RkwI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Asm Communications", "published": "2017-10-11T18:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Gut Fungi Could Play a Role in Obesity Epidemic", "text": "Subscribe to our listserv & receive press releases and other updates by email Wednesday, 11 October 2017 15:11 Gut Fungi Could Play a Role in Obesity Epidemic Email Washington, DC \u2013 October 11, 2017 \u2013 A high-fat diet changes fungi in the gut and may play a role in the development of obesity, according to a new study in mSphere , a journal of the American Society for Microbiology. While gut microbes have previously been implicated in the development of obesity, this study shows that fungi may also play a role. \"We really need to be looking at all the microbes and how they are interacting with each other to get a full picture of what the microbiome structure and function is in a given individual,\" said principal investigator Cheryl Gale, MD, associate professor in in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis. In recent years, research has revealed that gut microbes are involved in the development of obesity, but characterization of microbiota in lean versus obese individuals has been dominated by studies of gut bacteria, ignoring the potential contributions of fungi on metabolic health. \"Fungi have recently been shown to affect gut inflammation,\" said Dr. Gale. Although they represent a small component of the microbiota, fungal communities are significant in that they potentially serve as a reservoir for pathogens as well as for keystone species with critical roles in maintaining the function of the gut microbiome. (image: Alternaria sp. fungus, credit: CDC) In the new study, mice fed a high-fat diet had significantly different abundances of 19 bacterial and 6 fungal taxa than mice fed a standard diet, with a high-fat diet causing a similar magnitude of change in overall fungal and bacterial microbiome structures. Predicted microbiome functional modules related to metabolism were significantly less abundant in high-fat diets. The researchers also identified correlations of coabundance between specific fungi and bacteria in mice that are fed a normal diet and found that the number of these coabundance correlations decreased in the mice that were fed high-fat diets.\"Not only are we affecting the community of fungi with dietary change, but we also see that relationships between fungi and bacteria are changing,\" said Dr. Gale. \"These kingdoms are not in isolation. If one changes, it is going to impact the community structure and maybe the functional structure of other kingdoms as well. I think that is where the microbiome field is moving.\"The results of the study support the inclusion of fungal community analyses in studies that seek to discover new connections between intestinal microbiomes and metabolic health. Dr. Gale pointed out that sequencing fungi is more challenging than sequencing bacteria. \"The methods development hasn\u2019t caught up to where it is with bacteria. You need very sensitive methods because fungi are less abundant,\" said Dr. Gale. \"We haven\u2019t developed the databases of sequences for fungi like we have for bacteria. The databases aren\u2019t as rich, so when you sequence the fungal community, you often get sequences that don\u2019t match to anything.\" ### The American Society for Microbiology is the largest single life science society, composed of over 50,000 scientists and health professionals.

The use of antibiotics in agriculture has increased antibiotic-resistant microbes in associated foodstuffs. Fortunately, governmental institutions like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Center for Disease Control and Protection (CDC), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have many programs in place to prevent contamination as well as detect it when it does occur. A new study in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy reports how a routine surveillance program identified drug-resistant Salmonella contamination of grocery-store pork products. \nAACJournal: Identification of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in Salmonella isolated from swine ceca and retail pork chops in the United States. Map of where Salmonella containing one of two drug-resistance plasmid have been found in the United States. Source . \nThe National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) surveillance program tracks changes in drug susceptibility in gut bacteria from ill people, retail meats, and food animals in the U.S. From 2002 to 2015, all Salmonella isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, but 2013 to 2015 saw the emergence and increase of nonsusceptibility to 8% of isolates. To understand why, the research team led by first author Gregory Tyson and senior scientist Patrick McDermott sequenced the genome of 30 cipro-nonsusceptible isolates. This is how they happened to identify the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes being carried by 27 of the 30 sequenced samples. Plasmids containing quinolone-resistance genes were isolated from swine cecal contents or retail pork samples in nine states (see right). \nFluoroquinolone-resistant Salmonella are considered a serious threat to public health by the CDC. People sickened with fluoroquinolone-resistant enteric gram-negative bacteria have longer hospital stays and more complications . Additionally, plasmid-mediated drug resistance is more easily passed between bacterial species via horizontal gene transfer than genome-encoded resistance \u2013 meaning even people not sickened by these contaminating Salmonella could develop resistance in other members of their gut bacteria. \nVegetarians might think they can rest easy, but a second report in the same Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy issue described drug-resistant E. coli contamination among vegetables for sale in China. Similar to the study described above, the scientific team tested fresh vegetable samples for surveillance purposes, looking for the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production. Once identified, the ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were screened for mcr-1 , a gene that confers colistin resistance. Six of the 244 ESBL-producing isolates contained plasmid-borne mcr-1 . \nAACJournal: Emergence of mcr-1 in Raoultella ornithinolytica and Escherichia coli isolates from retail vegetables in China \nThe discovery of mcr-1 on fresh tomatoes and lettuce in China doesn\u2019t mean only the Chinese need worry. Globalization means bacteria can travel between countries as easily as cargo ships or planes can, and our interconnected trading systems (including food trade) mean health systems of different countries can very quickly be similarly affected. The fact that these resistance determinants are all found on plasmids also bodes poorly for their containment. It\u2019s worth noting that both reports found a second type of resistance after screening for a primary resistance unrelated to those reported, underscoring the problem of multiple drug resistance in our agriculture, foodstuffs, and other everyday interactions. The best recourse is to follow good food preparation techniques by thoroughly washing produce and cooking animal products to avoid exposure to these potentially dangerous pathogens.

Smith discusses her work uncovering ties between agriculture and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Her studies have found MRSA on and around pig farms, on animal handlers, and even in packaged meat in the grocery store. She also talks about using zombies as an allegory for infectious disease outbreak preparedness. \nSubscribe (free) on iPhone , Android , RSS , or by email . You can also listen on your mobile device with the ASM Podcast app . Julie's biggest takeaways: MRSA transitioned from primarily hospital-acquired to community-acquired infections in the 1990s. In the early 2000s, MRSA strains associated with livestock farming emerged in Europe. Smith\u2019s group was the first to identify agriculture-associated MRSA strains in the United States. Tara found MRSA on the very first farm in which she and her colleagues looked for MRSA. The MRSA strain ST398 appears to have originated in people as MSSA then moved to livestock, where the strain acquired some antibiotic resistance related genes. This is because zoonotic diseases are a two-way street and microbes can pass from people to animals, as well as passed from animals to people. Many factors may contribute to MRSA contamination of consumer meat products: for one, MRSA in farms is aerosolized and the same may be true in meat processing facilities. People can also be colonized and spread from workers to products. It\u2019s likely a mixture of strains from farms and strains from people working in the packing plants. Farms that raise animals without antibiotics were not positive for MRSA. Processing these animals at plants where conventional animals are raised creates potential for cross-contamination, however. Prophylactic and treatment applications of antibiotics are still allowed for livestock, but antibiotics used for growth promotion purposes were phased out in January 2017. Featured Quotes: \u201cI was in Iowa, the #1 pig-producing state. We started looking for MRSA + found them on the very 1st farm we sampled\u201d (8:22 minus 4:30 start) \u201cWhen we think of zoonotic diseases, usually we think of microbes that come from animals to people, but there can be bidirectional transmission. It\u2019s definitely not just a one-way street (10:15 minus 4:30 start) \u201cThat it doesn\u2019t cause disease in pigs made S. aureus invisible to people studying its epidemiology for quite a while\u201d (12:49 minus 4:30 start) \u201cOur biohazard people probably hated us because we had pounds and pounds of meat products we were checking\u201d for MRSA (17:26 minus 4:30 start) \"S. aureus is definitely not the only one - there\u2019s lots of bacteria that are affected by use of antibiotics on farms\u201d (4:43 in second file) \u201cEverything zombies now is a virus!\u201d \nLinks for this episode Aetiology Blog on Science Blogs Network Outbreak News Interview with Smith on her work communicating the science around vaccines and fighting anti-vaccine sentiments.

She was majoring in Economics and Finance with expectations to work for a Boston-area business, but an opportunity in her junior year of school changed her career plans. That year, Bentley partnered with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in organizing a pre-engineering program for inner-city students. Hulede saw the difference that exposure to possible careers and a strong network could make in a young person\u2019s life. \u201cIt was amazing to see students come in at the beginning of the summer with low confidence in their abilities and leave with plans to apply to undergraduate schools,\u201d Hulede says. After graduating, Bentley University employed her to join the Student Affairs Division staff. Hulede changed her career focus from one concentrated on business to one dedicated to facilitating educational opportunities. \nRarely is the impact of one person\u2019s career path so obviously tied to the options of others, but it\u2019s safe to say that Hulede\u2019s new career path affected the educational and career paths of thousands of students. Hulede\u2019s career in education led her to the American Society for Microbiology, where she and her Education Department team designed, built, and continue to organize the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS). Since its inception 16 years ago, Hulede has managed the conference program for the meeting, which has seen over 49,000 attendees in 16 years and at which 19,000 students have given presentations. \nABRCMS Past \n\nABRCMS was born out of an opportunity from the National Institutes of Health, which posted a request for proposals regarding new organizational management of a meeting for underrepresented minority students. Hulede, ASM Education Director Amy Chang, and a steering committee of multidisciplinary research faculty used this opportunity to enter a proposal on behalf of ASM. The team spoke with students, advisors, and exhibitors to learn how to best address the needs of all participants, agreeing that it was important to build a forum for undergraduate students but also to include a component for their advisors and the exhibitors who represent potential graduate schools or employment opportunities. \nThe result was a conference featuring scientific presentations, career-building opportunities, and educator resources. The meeting encompassed a four-day program, including an awards banquet to close out the conference and celebrate the learning that had occurred. The program included networking opportunities by offering meal service on-site at the conference and providing time for students to compare experiences or talk casually with speakers. Networking among peers at this early career stage is valuable as students grow academically and professionally, potentially leading to long-term scientific relationships. Each ABRCMS conference is a unique event, but Hulede has found that focusing on these aspects provides the greatest benefits to all attendees. \nABRCMS Present \n\nMost students who attend ABRCMS present their research formally during a poster session. This year, more than 1,900 posters will be on display in areas spanning all biomedical and behavioral sciences fields, from developmental biology to neuroscience to engineering. A small number of poster submitters (around 120) are selected to give an oral presentation. All poster and oral presentations are evaluated by three judges and given a score, with the top tier of presentations receiving prizes at the closing award banquet. While not all students receive an award, \u201cstudents should really consider an abstract acceptance to be a win,\u201d says Hulede, who is proud of the sophisticated concepts and techniques students master during the course of their research projects. \nEstablished scientists present their research too, and Hulede does her best to expose students to inspirational role models. Shirley Ann Jackson, Francis Collins, Freeman Hrabowski, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Andrew Young and the late Maya Angelou have spoken at past ABRCMS, encouraging attendees to become their greatest selves. The speakers are often eager to interact with the young scientists; after participating in a Q-and-A panel, the grandchildren of Henrietta Lacks, David and Jeri Lacks, then walked around the exhibit floor, visiting with students and asking questions about different research studies. Hulede and her team work hard to enhance the program year after year: \u201cYou never want attendees to feel like it\u2019s a cookie-cutter template,\u201d she says. \nPart of that hard work is spent finding a niche for all types of learners. \u201cMy goal is for everybody to have a unique and rich experience,\u201d Hulede says. She knows large lectures can be an intimidating environment for budding scientists to stand up and ask questions. To complement the keynote and plenary speakers, Hulede works with the program committee to build in many small discussion sessions. These create a more intimate environment that encourages participation from all students. \nTo further enhance the student experience, Hulede has stressed mentorship in this year\u2019s meeting. Working with top leaders in the community, she has identified excellent candidates, who have been trained for mentoring and advising undergraduates. These mentors will be available for small-group mentoring or coaching during the 2017 meeting, providing a complementary viewpoint to a student\u2019s existing mentorship circle, which is often concentrated in one institution. \nIncreasing skills outside the lab is a major focus of the program, with sessions on best networking techniques, identifying mentors, and interviewing skills aimed at undergrads and post-baccalaureate students. Sessions for early-career scientists about grant writing, course design, and research ethics provide tips for those still developing their careers, such as postdocs and early-career academics who often serve as volunteer judges. For those unsure about which trajectory to take, Hulede recommends attending career panels, where she tries to represent the wide variety of career opportunities available to young scientists. \u201cI invite people from government, science communication, industry. Sometimes I invite multiple people from the same sector, since three people from industry can have totally different career tracks, increasing student exposure to different possibilities,\u201d says Hulede. \nABRCMS Future \nIrene Hulede, far left, smiling with her colleagues that turn hard work into \"fun-hard work.\" Courtesy Irene Hulede. \n\u201cEach year, I ask myself, \u2018How am I going to wow folks?\u2019\u201d says Hulede. She stresses the importance of her small but enthusiastic team in brainstorming and actualizing innovative programming each year. There can be long hours and hard work in the weeks preceding the event, but working with similarly passionate colleagues like Ronica Rodela , part of the ABRCMS team since 2003, makes it \u201cfun-hard work.\u201d \nThat fun-hard work has resulted in ABRCMS being more popular than ever. There were over 4,000 attendees at the 2016 event, and the 2017 event is expected to surpass that. This has led to questions about whether the conference should continue to grow in size or be capped at a certain number of attendees. Rather than opting to turn people away, \u201cthe consensus is to keep growing it!\u201d says Hulede. This adds challenges for creating intimate discussion sessions, and the inspiration for the small-group mentoring came in part from addressing this challenge. One thing is clear from speaking with Hulede: she wants to expose as many young students as possible to as many career possibilities as possible. \u201cI love seeing young people succeed,\u201d she says. \nABRCMS is dedicated to bringing together students from underrepresented minorities to increase student awareness of the many paths a science career can take them along. It also gives students the chance to mingle with peers who may have similar experiences and role models who can help students solidify a vision of success for themselves in the future. When asked if she receives feedback from participants, Hulede laughs. \u201cWe may not know everyone\u2019s story, but we hope the little bit we can do to prepare them with this conference will get them to the next level.\u201d She then sends me an email containing feedback from many former attendees: \u201cThe most valuable lesson I learned from ABRCMS is that there are so many different opportunities for me in science and that I have so many mentors that I can rely on to help my plan my journey.\u201d \u201cI always thought that being a scientist was for \"other\" people, but it is for me!\u201d \u201cOut of all the lessons I learned in ABRCMS, the most valuable must be the importance of networking. I learned to step out of my comfort zone in many ways, from travelling alone for the first time to speaking to people I had never met before.\u201d \u201cThe most valuable lesson that i learned from attending ABRCMS is that no matter where you come from (either a big or small college) everyone has the very same potential of creating a great impact in the world of science.\u201d \u201cI have renewed my enthusiasm to continue doing research with undergraduate students\u201d \u201cMy overall experience at ABRCMS 2016 was beyond what I expected. The peers and colleagues I met helped inspire me to continue to pursue a scientific career, and aim for a Ph.D. The workshops were also very helpful and eye opening.\u201d \u201cThe conference was a wonderful, amazing experience that allowed me to explore a diverse set of disciplines while networking with fellow scientists. It reaffirmed my interest in the biomedical research field and has given me even more encouragement to follow through with it.\u201d \u201cThank you for the extraordinary opportunity to have been able to be not only encouraged, but also inspired by the amazing people at the conference. Being a first-generation Hispanic woman in engineering at a community college, I am beyond grateful for such a wonderful opportunity to grow and learn so much from everyone.\u201d \n\nRegister for the 2017 ABRCMS conference \n\nRegistration for the 2017 ABRCMS remains open through the event, being held in Phoenix, Ariz., November 1-4. The scientific program includes top research and is a great opportunity to hear scientific updates directly from the researchers conducting the studies. Are you attending the conference this year?
