You won\u2019t be able to stop eating them, which is one good reason to make these asap. \nPretzels may or may not make you thirsty, but the idea of a twisted, chubby, salty cloud of dough baked to golden perfection is enough to make just about anyone hungry. \nMy sourdough starter, George, has been begging to go into something delicious for a while now, and I thought I\u2019d make my vegan Sourdough Pretzels for Jay, who loves them, and also update this recipe, which I first shared on this blog almost exactly six years ago. \nI adapted this recipe all those years ago from the King Arthur Flour website, and it is a simple and very effective one, which is why I\u2019ve stuck with it. I did need to veganize it because the original contained milk powder, but these vegan pretzels turn out so gorgeous, you can be sure that nothing is lost in translation. They are soft and fluffy and super-delicious, and if you have a kid \u2014 or are a kid at heart \u2014 you will find that they disappear in minutes. \nIf you don\u2019t already have a sourdough starter , what\u2019s stopping you? This is a perfect time to make one, when the warm weather is still sticking around. Sourdough relies on capturing natural yeast from the environment, and a Fall kitchen is likely to have a good deal of yeast floating around, especially if you do a lot of baking. I love the very thought of capturing wild yeast from the air\u2013 it makes me feel like one of those superwomen from old times who did everything from scratch. Plus, I get to eat these pretzels and lots of other good stuff, like sourdough waffles, sourdough focaccia, sourdough sandwich bread, and much more. \nIf you have an aversion to fermented foods (Desi does), this sourdough pretzel (and most sourdough breads) does not have a sour flavor. Instead, the sourdough adds dimension and flavor and a wonderful texture to breads, not to mention good health, because you do know sourdough is probiotic and therefore really, really good for you?

A soy-free, nut-free recipe. \nThe other day, Jay told me he had brought up my blog to his fourth-grader friends. \n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d I asked, curious because to my surprise he said that they were actually interested and had questions. \n\u201cI told them you make lots and lots of desserts,\u201d he said. \nAh. \nUnfortunately, that was not very truthful. With a kid in the house, and a husband who has a very sweet tooth, I can\u2019t escape making desserts every now and then. I try and make them as healthy as possible without ruining them \u2014 like these sugar-free almond flour cookies that all of us love and that come together in minutes. \nBut lots and lots? Not by a stretch. \nStill, what was very obvious to me was that Jay was dropping a huge hint. Make more desserts, mom, is what I read between the lines. \nThis vegan Apple Pie Pull-Apart Bread was a result of that mommy guilt. \nThis is really not sweet enough to be a dessert, but I am not telling Jay that. He loves it anyway. It is more of a breakfast loaf, and if you bake this up the previous night and warm it up the next morning, you\u2019ll have something to look forward to upon waking up. \nI love making pull apart breads because they are so much fun, and they bake up so pretty. My vegan garlic and herb pull-apart loaf is always a hit, and I wanted to try out a sweet version using apples. To go with the apples I used apple pie spices, like cinnamon and nutmeg.

A vegan, gluten-free, soy-free, nut-free recipe. \nThis Onion Chutney, a very traditional South Indian recipe, is one of Desi\u2019s favorite sides for dosa or idli. But I smear it on just about anything, from a breakfast wrap to toast. Because it is just so delicious and so versatile. \nI have to thank a reader, Ellen, for prompting me to post this recipe. It is likely that many of you, like Ellen, have eaten this chutney at a restaurant and wondered what\u2019s in there because it tastes so rich and complex and flavorful. \nThe answer, and the recipe, are actually rather simple: there are onions in here, of course, along with tamarind, red pepper, mustard seeds, and curry leaves. That\u2019s it. But technique is important: it is the caramelizing of the onions that gives the chutney its intense flavor and complexity, so don\u2019t get stingy with your effort here. \nI actually use shallots to make this recipe, because they have a more intense flavor that works very well here. You could use red onions at a pinch. \nThis is a spicy chutney, the way it\u2019s supposed to be to complement a bland dosa or idli, but if you are not comfortable with spice, cut down on the amount of red pepper. Don\u2019t cut it out altogether, though, because you do need the pungent heat of pepper to complement the sweetness of the onions and the tang of the tamarind. \nI served this chutney for a Saturday brunch with my Instant Masala Dosa and Potato Curry. It was delicious. \nI remembered to take some step-by-step shots of the cooking process to clarify the technique. Heat the oil and add the shallots and red chili peppers to a wok or skillet. Saute the onions, stirring frequently, until they are soft and caramelize to a rich golden color. Add tamarind paste and continue to saute another two minutes. Make the tempering by adding mustard seeds, curry leaves, and udad dal to hot oil.

A vegan, soy-free recipe. \nIn India, making snacks for Diwali is a multi-day venture. My parents would start about a week or two before the big day and make goodies \u2014 sweet and savory \u2014 that would be stored in huge steel and aluminum tins, to be eaten on the big day and shared. I can\u2019t remember anyone ever complaining about all the time and effort that went into prepping food for Diwali, because it was all part of the fun and anticipation. \nNo one except my uncle Suresh Kaka, the resident cynic of our extended family. Suresh Kaka, a source of delight to us kids because his signature frown and perpetually disgusted manner were so easy to mimic behind his back, never actually helped with any of the Diwali cooking. \u201cJust get everything from the store,\u201d he\u2019d advise the cook from his armchair, before taking a deep puff of his cigarette. \u201cThey taste just as good.\u201d \nAt the time, when buying snacks for Diwali from a store seemed like blasphemy, his advice was never taken seriously. But today, in my busy world, I feel rather like Suresh Kaka with his eternal disapproval of Diwali snack-making. Making half a dozen or more Diwali snacks from scratch seems not only a monumental job, it is almost impossible. \nStores in India and Indian grocery stores here in the United States do offer plenty of Diwali snacks you can buy off the shelf, but the problem is, these snacks really are nothing like what my parents would make. \nThe Indian store I go to here in Maryland sells the usual, multicolored, dairy-filled, ghee-laden sweets like burfis and halwas and pedhas that you can find any time of the year. But the stuff of my Diwali memories is different: paper-thin, crispy Mande ; salty, multi-textured Chivda with rice crispies and peanuts, squiggly spirals of Chakli that melt in the mouth, and, one of my favorites, golden, boat-like Karanji with a delicious filling hiding inside. These were snacks that rarely, if ever, were made another time of year, which made them all the more special. \n\nI do not have the time to make a half a dozen snacks, but every year, for Diwali (which is next week) I try and recreate a vegan version of at least one of those recipes for my family and for you. \nThis year, I thought I\u2019d try out an easy version of Karanji. This is a sweet that\u2019s usually deep-fried, but for my quick version, which was all done in under an hour, I used puff pastry. I did make the filling from scratch, although the puff pastry was store-bought, so I think both my parents and Suresh Kaka would approve. \ud83d\ude42 \nI\u2019ll leave you now with the recipe and wishes for a very Happy Diwali.

This recipe has no added fats, and it\u2019s gluten-free and soy-free. \nIn the past few weeks, I\u2019ve noticed something strange happening to my family. I\u2019ve been trying to get my sugar-loving son and my dessert-loving husband to eat more desserts that are naturally sweetened, or made with very little or no fat. A lot of this food has also been gluten-free, not because I\u2019m consciously trying to avoid gluten, but because I\u2019ve really been enjoying baking desserts with almond and coconut flours. \nI\u2019ve surprised myself with the great results I\u2019ve got. But what has surprised me even more is that both Jay and Desi have actually been loving these sweets. A lot. \nGrain-free, naturally sweetened chocolate chip cookies ? Gone in 60 seconds. Breakfast chia seed muffins ? Mom, can you make more soon? \nSo while coming up with ideas for great vegan Thanksgiving desserts, I\u2019ve been trying to incorporate more grain-free, gluten-free ingredients. The Pumpkin Praline Tart I have for you today is going to the top of my dessert list. \nThis is a delicious tart, and it probably has way fewer calories than you\u2019d find in your average tart, not least because it\u2019s made with absolutely no added fat. That\u2019s right. There\u2019s no added fat in the crust, or the filling, or the topping. \nThe crust is a cookie-like almond flour crust sweetened slightly with maple syrup. For the pumpkin filling, I went a little overboard and roasted and pureed up a kabocha squash. A kabocha squash, if you\u2019re not familiar with it, is a rotund, green-blue beauty that works perfectly for desserts, because of its naturally sweet flesh. \nOf course, you can also just use a regular pumpkin, or canned pumpkin puree. \nThe praline topping is made up of pecans, of course, and lightly sweetened. Together, all of these layers add up to a divine dessert that\u2019ll leave you licking your fork. \nOne of the things I love about this tart is that everything comes together in the food processor. Separately, so you do have to rinse out your processor bowl a couple of times, but it\u2019s still quite a convenience. \nOne thing I would do a little differently the next time I make this tart is to spray the sides of my tart pan with some cooking spray. I found that the almond crust was a little hard to release from the sides, although the bottom came off without any problem. \nOn to the recipe now. Hope you try it \u2014 and love it \u2014 as much as we did! 5 from 2 votes Print Vegan Pumpkin Praline Tart, gluten-free and with no added fats A divine vegan Pumpkin Praline Tart with a cookie-like almond flour crust and a pecan praline topping that's out of this world.

It\u2019s thick and tangy and delicious and filled with great-for-you probiotic cultures. \nI love this cashew yogurt so much, it has pretty much replaced the quick, non-cultured yogurt I\u2019d blend up in the past to eat or add to various dishes. \nI loved yogurt in my pre-vegan days and I\u2019ve never really been able to wrap my head around storebought vegan yogurts, which just don\u2019t taste right and their texture is almost always completely off. Call me picky. \nSo the last time I bought a cashew yogurt off the shelf that had live cultures, I decided to try making my own. Partly so I didn\u2019t have to spring six bucks for a small tub of yogurt, and partly so I didn\u2019t have to rush to Whole Foods each time I needed some. \nI also wanted a thicker yogurt, and the storebought ones are too thin for my liking. \nI loved the result, and I started to make my own, using some of the storebought yogurt as a starter. \nThis is really a very simple recipe \u2014 all you need are the cashews and the starter (any vegan yogurt with live bacterial cultures will do), a bowl, and a blender, and you\u2019re all set. The result is a thick, creamy, tangy yogurt that tastes gorgeous. \nI love eating this yogurt by the spoonful, but I especially love stirring in some berries, or using it to top granola. It also works great in Indian curries, raitas and biryanis, when the recipe calls for yogurt. \nTry making some today. It takes minutes, and it is, like any homemade yogurt, a gift that keeps on giving.

This ravishing Sourdough Olive and Sage Loaf is one of them. \nIf you love baking with sourdough, you know that one of the things that makes it so special is the journey itself. With sourdough, you can be sure that you will be surprised at every stage of the bread-making process. Pleasantly. \nWith most breads, the rising is done by the time you put your loaf in the oven. But with sourdough, the loaf you pull out of your oven will look very different from the loaf you put inside it. Because within the 45 minutes or so that it bakes, all of those wonderful bacteria in sourdough and the gases they produce would have worked their magic, making your loaf bigger, puffier, and way more delicious than you thought possible. \nIf you don\u2019t yet have a batch of sourdough sitting in your refrigerator, what are you waiting for? You can find step-by-step instructions for making a sourdough starter here, and if you do decided to get one going, it\u2019s a decision you\u2019ll never regret. \nI added a ton of deliciousness to this loaf, by way of olives, pepper, sage, and garlic, because I wanted a full-flavored bread. This loaf is so delicious, in fact, that you might find yourself tearing chunks of it and stuffing it into your mouth.

It deserves to scream \u201cINSTANT,\u201d in all caps. \nI gifted myself an Instant Pot this past week, not because there\u2019s a dearth of pressure cookers in my house \u2014 there isn\u2019t \u2014 but because my slow cooker, which I\u2019ve used for nearly a decade and a half now, is pretty much on its last legs. It\u2019s one of those older models, with just a knob that sets to \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow,\u201d nothing fancy, and ever since that knob fell out a couple of years ago, it\u2019s been pretty much stuck at \u201chigh.\u201d But I hate throwing things out when I can still get some use from them, so I stuck with it until Desi finally begged me to replace it. \nSince the Instant Pot can both slow-cook and pressure-cook, among several other functions, it looked like a good option. Besides, does anyone not have an Instant Pot these days? I\u2019ve been getting tons of requests for Instant Pot recipes, and since so much Indian food gets cooked in a pressure cooker, I knew this was one appliance that would not be gathering dust. \nI started out with this simple recipe that requires hardly any prep because I\u2019ve been a little swamped. Work has been crazy as usual, and we\u2019re also getting some long-needed work done on the house, which means there have been workmen traipsing in and out of the kitchen, making it impossible to cook. Half of my things are covered up by plastic sheets, or, right when I need to get something from the refrigerator, someone\u2019s put a ladder right in front of it and is poking into the wall above it. \nSame with the photos, because Desi had to move from his usual location to a less desirable one with not-so-ideal light. \nLong story short, it was something of a small miracle that I got this Mushroom Potato Korma done, and the Instant Pot certainly made the job easier. \nA korma, if you\u2019ve never made it before, is a silky, creamy Indian stew with vegetables or meat in it. Some kormas are made with coconut milk, others with nuts. The result is almost always mindblowing and delicious. \nThis korma is certainly all that. I used a mix of fresh crimini and dry shiitake mushrooms, but you can use wild mushrooms like chanterelles or oysters too. Button mushrooms are fine. What I loved about the Instant Pot was that it cooked up the fresh mushrooms really beautifully, without making them too soggy, while retaining the wonderfully chewy texture of the dry mushrooms. \nIf you don\u2019t have an Instant Pot, you can certainly make this korma on the stovetop, although your cooking time will be longer, because you need to get the potatoes tenderized. And if you want a nut-free version, use a cup of coconut milk instead of the cashews. \nHope you try!
