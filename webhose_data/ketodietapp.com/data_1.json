| The KetoDiet Blog", "text": "Oct 4, 2017 \nHi Friends, I have great news for you! \nAfter over three months in development and over two months in beta testing, an update of KetoDiet for iOS and Android has been released. You can now scan products, and search though hundreds of thousands of branded products! \nApart from barcode scanning, we improved the Planner and introduced a simplified way to display your days, macros and targets. Learn More About KetoDiet and KetoDiet Basic Barcode Scanning and Expanded Food Database \nBarcode scanning for branded products is now supported. Products can be scanned directly in the Planner and can also be scanned & added to Custom meals. Searching for ingredients also lists branded products. Internet connectivity is required for these features and are available on both Android and iOS devices as shown below. \nYou can now scan products from: the Planner when adding meals, and the Custom Meals tab when creating a custom meal. Coming soon: Barcode scanning in the Ingredients tab will be added in an upcoming update. How Does Barcode Scanning Work? \nA barcode is simply a product identifier - it does not include nutrition facts or any other product details. When a product is scanned, the barcode is matched against hundreds of thousands of known products in a food database. For barcode scanning to work well, the most crucial element is the food database. In our case we have created a database composed of several data sources: USDA Branded Products Tesco Labs Database Open Food Facts Database \nWe have designed our database so that it's easy to add more sources in the future. How Reliable is Barcode Scanning? \nThe inherent problem any food database, especially crowd sourced ones, is that they contain inaccurate or incomplete data. Broadly speaking, food databases are either crowd-sourced or verified. \nOriginally, we planned to only include verified sources, avoiding all crowd sourced data. However, verified sources are limited and do not include some commonly used branded products. Although we knew we have to include some crowd-sourced data, we didn't want to sacrifice the accuracy of the app, so we took steps to eliminate errors. How Are We Different? \nInstead of just using the available food databases, we developed a system to rank product data (we call it \"trust level\") so we can always offer users the most reliable results from all the data sources we are using. We also use this approach to eliminate products for which the nutritional data are clearly incorrect. \nAlthough this doesn't mean the data you find will always be 100% accurate, we eliminate most errors, allowing our users to reliably track their diet. What Causes Inaccurate Data? \nErrors caused in databases can be down to: Incorrectly entered data in food databases . Since there are hundreds of thousands of products (and growing daily), it is not an option to manually fix errors. To eliminate most errors we validate the data as explained above. Products may be labeled incorrectly, or do not include sufficient information. Nutrition facts can be rounded up or down, which may be significant for some of them. Some products, such as sweeteners, may list nutrition facts for small amounts, such as \"per teaspoon\", in which case macronutrients are often rounded down to \"zero\". It therefore impossible to calculate values for larger quantities, such as 1 cup. As I mentioned in this post , \"net\" carbs do not always reflect reality. Apart from fibre that can be fully deducted from total carbs, there are other types of carbohydrates that are deducted leading to seemingly low net carbs. Since there are no strict rules for labelling \"net\" carbs, some types of carbs such as sugar alcohols, fructooligosaccharides or isomaltosaccharides are often completely deducted, even though they partially - and sometimes significantly - affect blood sugar. Improved Planner (iOS Only, Android Soon) \nWe enhanced the Planner and day stats so you can quickly see if you're meeting your daily macros.

Place the zucchini in a large bowl and add the cinnamon, Erythritol, cream of tatar (or lemon juice). Combine well and let the zucchini sit for about 10 minutes to release the juices. Optionally, add a few drops of stevia. Add the chia seeds and mix until well combined. Let the chia seeds soak in all the excess juices, for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200 C (400 F). When the chia seeds have soaked up all the liquids, melt the shredded mozzarella (in a microwave oven or on the stove over a low heat), and then mix in the almond flour. Roll the dough out between 2 sheets of parchment paper until very thin (I used a silicon mat and silicon rolling pin ). Add the filling in the centre of the dough. Fold over like an envelope and seal the dough. Poke some holes for releasing the steam while baking. Bake for about 15 minutes or until golden brown on top. When done, remove from the oven and let it cool down for a few minutes. Serve warm or cold. Enjoy with a dollop of whipped cream or keto ice-cream ! My Failed Experiment \nUsing chia seeds is essential in this recipe. They will soak up all the liquids and prevent the pockets from getting soggy. \nIn my first attempt, I didn't use them. Instead, I squeezed out the liquids by placing the grated zucchini in a nut milk bag. I then added all the remaining ingredients (cinnamon, cream of tartar and Erythritol). That was not enough and more liquids were released even during baking. Although the filling itself was fine, the pockets were too moist, soggy and soft on the bottom. Do you like this recipe?

Hormone Fluctuations and Insulin Resistance During Menopause \nDuring a woman's reproductive years, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) causes the release of an egg from one of her ovaries approximately every 28 days and stimulates ovarian production of estrogen. After ovulation, the follicle that housed the egg produces progesterone. \nHowever, as a woman enters perimenopause, her ovaries contain fewer eggs and begin to produce less estrogen and progesterone. In response, the brain's pituitary gland steps up its production of FSH in an attempt to increase estrogen output. During this period of time, estrogen levels may fluctuate widely, but during the final couple of years before menopause, they steadily decline. \nNormally, estrogen directs fat to be deposited in the hip and thigh area following puberty. This is why many, although not all, women tend to gain weight in this area during their reproductive years. \nHowever, as estrogen levels decrease during menopause, fat storage shifts to the abdomen. Unlike the subcutaneous fat stored in your hips and thighs, excess visceral fat doesn't just affect your appearance and the way your clothes fit. It's also strongly linked to insulin resistance, heart disease and other health problems ( 2 ). Weight Gain Around Menopause \nIn addition to the change in fat distribution, most women notice that their weight goes up several pounds during and after perimenopause. This seems to be due to a combination of factors. \nFirst, lower levels of estrogen promote insulin resistance and higher levels of insulin in the blood, or hyperinsulinemia, that promotes weight gain ( 3 , 4 ). \nSecondly, research suggests that levels of the \u201chunger hormone\u201d ghrelin increase in the early stages of perimenopause ( 5 ). \nMoreover, low estrogen levels during and after menopause may impair production of leptin and neuropeptide Y, hormones that help regulate appetite and weight balance ( 6 , 7 ). The resulting increase in appetite and lack of satiety can lead to overeating and weight gain. \nHowever, some women put on weight even if they don't eat more than usual during menopause, due to the hormone changes previously discussed. \nFinally, loss of muscle mass that occurs during menopause and the aging process can slow down metabolism, making it much easier to put on weight ( 8 ). Low-Carb and Keto Diets for Menopausal Symptoms Weight Management \nThere is a growing body of research showing that low-carb and keto diets are very effective for weight loss. \nA major benefit of being in ketosis is suppression of appetite, which may be due in part to lower ghrelin levels ( 9 ). \nIndeed, a 2014 systematic review of 12 studies concluded that ketogenic diets do reduce hunger and appetite. Moreover, the authors defined a ketogenic diet as one that produced fasting \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate levels greater than or equal to 0.3 mM ( 10 ). This is actually a very mild level of ketosis that most people can achieve by limiting net carb intake to 50 grams or less per day. \nAnecdotally, many women have reported losing weight during and after menopause by following a low-carb or keto lifestyle. \nHowever, although middle-aged and older women have been included in some studies on carb restriction, there is surprisingly little research looking at the effects of this way of eating in menopausal women alone. \nIn a two-year randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 70 obese postmenopausal women, a low-carb, paleo diet led to greater reduction in abdominal fat and triglycerides than women following a low-fat diet ( 11 ). \nIn another RCT, 50 overweight or obese middle-aged women followed either a calorie-restricted diet or a non-calorie-restricted diet initially providing 20 grams of carb per day that was gradually increased by 10 grams a week over 12 weeks. Although the two groups lost similar amounts of weight, the low-carb group had a larger drop in triglycerides and greater improvement in cholesterol ratios than the calorie-restricted group ( 12 ). \nIt's worth pointing out that although the low-carb group started out eating a keto diet, they were no longer anywhere near ketosis at 140 grams of carb by the end of the study. This shows that following a very low carb approach resulting in high ketone levels is not imperative for weight loss . \nClearly, more high-quality studies on low-carb and keto diets need to be conducted in menopausal women. However, it stands to reason that eating in a way that lowers insulin levels and helps control hunger would be very beneficial for them. Hot Flashes \nUnfortunately, there is also a lack of formal research exploring the effects of keto or low-carb diets on hot flashes. \nHowever, many women who start a keto diet report having fewer and less severe hot flashes. In several cases, the improvement seems to be rapid and significant. \nAccording to retired neurosurgeon Dr. Larry McCleary, there's a biochemical reason for this effect. \nIn his book The Brain Trust Program , Dr. McCleary explains that the decline in estrogen during the menopausal transition reduces the action of glucose transporters responsible for delivering glucose to the brain. He states that this process is similar to what occurs in children with epilepsy and other seizure disorders, although menopausal women experience it to a much lesser extent. \nDr. McCleary says that women who suffer from hot flashes can reduce their frequency and severity by following a very-low-carb diet that provides the brain with ketones it can use as fuel. His dietary approach includes nutrient-dense foods like meat, fish, poultry, eggs, cheese, nuts, seeds, non-starchy vegetables, olive oil, and small amounts of berries. In addition, he recommends fats like coconut oil or MCT oil to naturally boost ketone levels. Other Menopausal Symptoms \nTo date, there are no studies supporting carb restriction for mood swings,\u201cbrain fog,\u201d irritability and other mental or emotional changes common during the menopause transition. \nHowever, some menopausal women have reported that their mood, memory, and ability to concentrate improved once they switched to a keto way of eating. \nIn addition, some research suggests that nutritional ketosis may improve memory in older people with mild cognitive deficits ( 13 ). \nAlthough high quality research on ketogenic diets for hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms is needed, the reports from women who have achieved beneficial effects are very encouraging. How Many Carbs Per Day Should Women in Menopause Eat? \nAgain, based on the lack of research in this area, it is hard to make specific recommendations for the amount of carbs women in menopause should consume. However, generally speaking, restricting intake to less than 50 grams of net carbs per day will help suppress appetite, reduce insulin levels and increase insulin sensitivity, which can make weight loss or maintenance easier. \nHowever, if your goal is to be in nutritional ketosis in order to relieve hot flashes, improve mood, or boost memory and concentration, you may need to stick to about 20-30 grams of net carb per day . Best Low-Carb Foods for Menopause \nIn addition to keeping carbs low, there are some specific foods that may help boost fat loss and/or help reduce menopausal symptoms. Flaxseed \nFlaxseed may help relieve certain menopausal symptoms, especially hot flashes. However, the effects seem to vary from woman to woman, based on anecdotal reports and high-quality studies ( 14 , 15 ). \nTo learn more about flax's health benefits, safety profile, and ways to include it in your diet, have a look at my article: Is Flaxseed Healthy? Safety Concerns, Benefits & Recommendations Green Tea \nGreen tea is rich in catechins, which are potent antioxidants. It's also the best source of a specific catechin known as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which has been credited with beneficial health effects on cardiovascular and metabolic health. \nStudies in menopausal women have found that caffeinated green tea helps lower insulin in those with elevated levels, whereas decaffeinated green tea doesn't seem provide the same benefit ( 16 , 17 ). Fatty Fish \nFatty fish has been shown to reduce inflammation, lower triglycerides, improve artery function, and protect brain health. These effects are largely due to its high content of EPA and DHA, the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids found in salmon, sardines, mackerel and herring. \nIn an RCT of 87 postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome, the women whose diets were supplemented with omega-3 fats had significant reductions in insulin resistance, blood pressure and inflammatory markers compared to those who followed the same diet without omega-3 supplementation ( 18 ). \nTo get the benefits of these omega-3 fatty acids, aim for a minimum of two 100-gram (3.5-ounce) servings of fatty fish per week. Other Lifestyle Modifications for Menopause Physical Activity \nStaying active is crucial during and after menopause. Studies in postmenopausal women have shown that regular exercise can help relieve stress, boost metabolism and fat burning, and prevent loss of muscle mass ( 19 , 20 , 21 ). In addition, physical activity may potentially relieve hot flashes in some women. \nOne study found that women who engaged in a six-month exercise program during menopause had lower hot flash scores than women who didn't exercise when researchers followed up on all the women four years later ( 20 ). \nAlthough all forms of exercise are beneficial , strength training is by far the most effective for managing symptoms of menopause , slowing down the aging process, and improving body composition. \nIn a study of 32 postmenopausal women, performing high-volume resistance training three times a week for 16 weeks led to greater muscular strength, loss of belly fat and a decrease in inflammatory markers than less rigorous exercise ( 21 ). \nLifting weights for several repetitions three times a week seems to provide optimal results. However, if physical issues limit your ability to lift weights, you can still benefit from other types of exercise, including walking. The key is making regular exercise a part of your life and doing the best that you can. Yoga \nYoga is well known for relieving stress. A few studies have found that yoga, tai chi and similar mind-body therapies may also improve certain menopausal symptoms, such as sleeping issues and hot flashes, in some women ( 22 , 23 , 24 ). \nMoreover, yoga seems to increase overall well-being and satisfaction with life during the menopause transition. \nIn a controlled study of 260 menopausal women lasting 18 weeks, significant improvements in physical, psychological, and social quality of life scores occurred in the women who were assigned to the yoga group ( 24 ). Acupuncture \nAcupuncture is a form of Traditional Chinese Medicine that appears to be effective for hot flashes and improving sleep. \nIn one study of 209 women aged 45-60 who were having several hot flashes on a daily basis, 6 months of acupuncture treatments helped reduce the frequency of their hot flashes by more than 36%, whereas women in the control group who didn't receive acupuncture had a 6% increase in hot flash frequency ( 25 ). \nAdditionally, a 2016 detailed analysis of 31 studies concluded that acupuncture may significantly improve sleep quality in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with sleeping issues ( 26 ). Supplements Pycnogenol \nPycnogenol is also known as French maritime pine bark extract. It contains several antioxidants, including procyanidins, which are also found in cocoa, nuts, berries, and grapes. \nResearch suggests that pycnogenol may modestly reduce hot flashes, insomnia, mood swings and other menopausal symptoms ( 27 , 28 ). Is Pycnogenol Suitable for Everyone? \nPycnogenol seems to be safe for most women. However, because it may potentially stimulate the immune system, people with autoimmune disease are best off avoiding it. In addition, if you have a bleeding disorder or take blood thinners, you should speak with your doctor before taking pycnogenol. \nRecommended dosage is 50 mg 1-2 times per day. You can get Pycnogenol on Amazon and many other health stores. Other Supplements \nA few of the more common herbs used to relieve menopausal symptoms include black cohosh , dong quai , and red clover . However, study results on these herbs have been mixed, and more research is needed to confirm that they are safe for long-term use. Take Home Message \nMenopause can be extremely challenging for many women. \nFortunately, there are many things that can help you through the menopause transition, starting with following a nutrient-dense ketogenic or low-carb diet. A very-low-carb lifestyle can help lower insulin levels, improve insulin sensitivity, keep your appetite under control and potentially even reduce hot flashes and other symptoms. \nIn addition, there are several health benefits of ketogenic or low-carb diets. Following this way of eating may reduce other heart disease risk factors, which is especially important once you lose the cardioprotective effects of estrogen. \nIt's important to understand that losing weight during menopause can be extremely tough even if you do everything right. Whether a low-carb or keto diet actually leads to weight loss will depend on a number of other factors, some of which you can control and others you can't, such as genetics. \nEngaging in regular exercise, managing stress, and practicing other healthy behaviors that enhance your keto or low-carb lifestyle can improve your chances for maintaining a healthy weight and great quality of life during and after menopause.

However, a mild deficiency can be much more common causing symptoms including ( 5 ). An increase in blood pressure Increased salt sensitivity Increased risk of kidney stones Heart arrhythmias Headaches Hyperkalemia \nHyperkalemia is when potassium levels are too high in the body, classed as >7.5 mmol/L ( 6 ). This often only occurs when potassium intake exceeds 17.6 g/day which is usually done through supplementation. As well as excessive supplementation, certain medical conditions (such as kidney disease) and medications can cause high potassium levels. \nThe most common symptom of high potassium is abnormal heart beat. With the severest outcome being that of cardiac arrest ( 7 ). Potassium Levels on a Low Carb Diet \nIn the first few weeks of starting a low-carb diet, the symptoms of the \u201cketo-flu\u201d can come into full effect. One of the major reasons for the symptoms occurring is due to a change in electrolyte balance. Potassium is one of those electrolytes that can be affected. \nIn the first few weeks, your body loses a significant amount of water. As this is processed through the kidneys this can then affect the electrolyte balance. Sodium is often the first electrolyte to be lost. Since potassium is closely related to sodium and because the kidneys control the levels, a drop-in potassium can also be experienced. \nThe symptoms of muscle cramps, heart arrhythmias and fatigue could be a combination of lower salt and subsequent potassium levels. \nTherefore, ensuring you get adequate salt in your diet is important both for sodium and potassium balance and to alleviate any keto-flu. Top 7 Potassium Rich Foods \nBelow is a list of the top 7 foods high in potassium that you should eat daily to hit your required levels. 1. Spinach \nAll dark green leafy vegetables offer an abundance of nutrients including spinach. One cup (180 g) of cooked spinach offers a significant amount of potassium at 839 mg (24% of RNI) ( 8 ). That is almost double what a medium sized banana offers in the way of potassium at only 422 mg! \nAlthough spinach has one of the highest magnesium contents, other dark green leafy veg that offers a good source of magnesium include kale, swiss chard and broccoli. 2. Avocados \nAs well as providing a significant amount of healthy fats , avocados are also packed full of certain electrolytes and minerals. \nJust one average avocado (136 g) contains 690 mg (20% RNI) of potassium ( 9 ). 3. Zucchini \nSquash is a a great versatile vegetable that also carries with it, a relatively low carbohydrate content at just under 4 g (net carbs) per cup. \nIt is also relatively high in potassium with one medium zucchini (192 g) providing 512 mg (15%) ( 10 ). 4. Salmon \nSalmon is best known for providing an excellent source of omega 3, but it is also packed full of other essential nutrients. Whilst providing a great source of the B vitamins and vitamin D it is also a good source of potassium. For a 3-oz serving it provides 416 mg (12% RNI) ( 11 ). \nOther fish including cod, sea bream, monkfish, sardines, herring and mackerel also offer a good source of magnesium. 5. Beef \nOften when people look at sources of potassium they list mostly fruits and vegetables but meat sources offer a significant amount of potassium as well. A 4-oz steak provides 384 mg (11% RNI) of potassium ( 12 ). \nAs well as beef, other meats (such as pork and lamb) and poultry (such as chicken and turkey) also offer a good level of magnesium. 6. Mushrooms \nMushrooms make a great base for many low-carbohydrate dishes and can be a great option for those following more of a plant based low-carbohydrate diet. They are known for being higher in vitamin B12 as well as having a great antioxidant capacity which can help fight free radicals ( 13 ). \nWhilst all mushroom do have a higher potassium level, just 1 cup (72 g) of crimini mushrooms have the highest at 323 mg (9% RNI) ( 14 ). 7. Cauliflower \nCauliflower is a cruciferous based vegetable and is extremely nutrient dense, including having a high antioxidant profile in sulfur-containing compounds. One cup (107 g) contains 320 mg of potassium (9% RNI) ( 15 ). Other Sources of Potassium \nNuts and seeds are a great staple within a low carbohydrate diet providing sources of good fats, protein and certain minerals. Almonds offer the highest potassium content out of all the nut options with 1 oz (28 g) providing 200 mg (6% RNI) ( 16 ). \nBeets are often classed as a superfood as they are packed full of phytonutrients that act as powerful antioxidants. As well as being high in both folate and manganese, it is a great source of potassium. One cup (136 g) provides 442 mg (13% RNI) ( 17 ). Since they contain more carbs than other vegetables, they should be eaten in moderation if you follow a low-carb diet. Supplementation \nDue to the risk of developing Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), supplements are rarely sold with a content of more than 85 mg. Before ever supplementing with potassium, you should always consult with a health professional ( 18 ). \nTo supplement potassium, you can use: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "keto recipes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "salmon  salmon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "potassium rich foods  below", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cauliflower  cauliflower", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T08:34:15.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eca57ac9ef375975c3084543103884c7ddf0973a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQjeR4M7r2pTZygN2J.2Wqk5GWHC7QK7T473j4JgsNxQKigsEJs6RUrFX9gfTP7CkcTjxkFz7YxfGCBqq8M08iXc41E9lSv_nsRp8JgZDoBe6ZckXhrzJkaFd8rhjdbzE-", "site_full": "ketodietapp.com", "site": "ketodietapp.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Announcing My New Book - Keto Slow Cooker & One-Pot Meals | The KetoDiet Blog", "title_full": "Announcing My New Book - Keto Slow Cooker & One-Pot Meals | The KetoDiet Blog", "published": "2017-10-19T18:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.034, "main_image": "http://ketodietapp.com/Blog/image.axd?picture=/2017/10/SlowCookerBook-announcement-blog.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 56734, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eca57ac9ef375975c3084543103884c7ddf0973a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQjeR4M7r2pTZygN2J.2Wqk5GWHC7QK7T473j4JgsNxQKigsEJs6RUrFX9gfTP7CkcTjxkFz7YxfGCBqq8M08iXc41E9lSv_nsRp8JgZDoBe6ZckXhrzJkaFd8rhjdbzE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-19T18:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Announcing My New Book - Keto Slow Cooker & One-Pot Meals | The KetoDiet Blog", "text": "100+ Recipes & More Homemade Basics 25 Quick-prep keto basics including Kimchi, Mayonnaise, homemade stocks, pumpkin puree, and curry pastes. 11 Keto staples such as Red Pesto, Sweet & Sour BBQ Sauce, Cranberry Sauce, Make-Ahead Slow Cooker Mash, and Sourdough Keto Buns. 14 Satisfying and nourishing soups including Hungarian Goulash, Ratatouille Soup, Chicken Mulligatawny Soup, Hamburger Soup, Pumpkin & Chorizo Meatball Soup, Salmon Chowder, and Mexican Chili Soup. 16 One-pot & skillet meals such as Pork Lo Mein, Green Shakshuka, Egg Fried Cauli-Rice, Halloumi Jalfrezi, One-Pot Cheese-Stuffed Meatballs, Cajun Andouille Gumbo, Filipino Chicken Adobo, and Coq Au Vin. 45 Savoury stews, roasts and casseroles.

These cookies can easily be converted into a 4th of July treat! Simply use blueberries in place of the pumpkin seed butter and tahini ! Find out more Instructions Prepare the raspberry chia jam. Place the raspberries in a small saucepan and mash using a fork. Add the water. Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook for 2 to 3 minutes to soften, then remove from the heat. Optionally, add the stevia. Finally, add the chia seeds. Stir and let the mixture sit for at least 20 minutes to thicken and cool. Store in the fridge in a jar or an airtight container until ready to be used, or for up to 1 week. To make the cookies, preheat the oven to 160 C / 320 F. Place all the ingredients in a food processor and pulse until well combined. Alternatively, gently heat up the almond and coconut butter until soft. Place in a bowl and mix into a dough with the remaining ingredients. Using your hands, create 12 small cookie dough balls (33 g/ 1.2 oz per ball). Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a non-stick silicon baking mat. Using your thumb, dent each cookie and shape into a small bowl. Place in the oven and bake for about 12 minutes or until lightly browned. When done, remove from the oven and let them cool down. At first, they will be fragile and that's when you need to dent the cookies again in the middle but this time with a teaspoon. Gently dent them without breaking. This way they will be able to hold more filling. The cookies will harden as they chill but they will remain fragile - do not remove them from the baking sheet or they may break. Once completely cool, they are ready for to be decorated. Top each one with a heaped teaspoon of the chia jam. Note: I kept the cookies on the silicon mat until they were fully decorated, and then gently placed them one by one in a large plate. In a bowl, mix the mascarpone, vanilla and pumpkin pie spice mix. Optionally, add sweetener. Spoon the mascarpone filling in a piping bag and fill each cookie with about a tablespoon. Using the other side of a teaspoon, create a small dent in the middle of the filling. Add about \u00bc teaspoon of the pumpkin seed butter to create the \"iris\". Finally, top with a small piece of dark tahini to create the \"pupil\". The cookies are ready to be served. You can keep them in the fridge for up to 5 days. Once stored, the chia jam may slightly bleed into the mascarpone filling which enhances the spooky effect! Undecorated cookies can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week or frozen for up to 3 months. Happy Halloween!

The immune system is a defence that guards the body against bacteria, fungi or parasites. \nA combination of genetics and an environmental (viral infection, vaccines, low levels of vitamin D, cow\u2019s milk or increased insulin demand) trigger engages the immune system to attack and destroy the beta cells in the pancreas. After these beta cells are destroyed, the body is unable to produce insulin. \nType 1 diabetes is the result of the inability of the pancreas to produce insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the pancreas produces insulin. Who Gets Type 1 Diabetes? \nType 1 diabetes can affects all age groups. Although it usually appears during childhood or adolescence, it can develop in adults as well. \nIn the US, the rate of Type 1 diabetes in children has increased by almost 60% in 11 years ( 1 ) and approximately 1 in 300 children in the US will be affected by type 1 diabetes by 18 years of age ( 2 ). There are too many children who are effected globally. \nThe highest rates are in northern Europe and in individuals of European decent. Men are more commonly affected in early adult life. ( 1 ) Data suggests the incidence of T1D has been increasing by 2\u20135% worldwide. ( 4 ) What Happens When Your Body Does Not Make Enough Insulin? \nBeta cells in the pancreas are destroyed by your own immune system resulting in too little or no insulin ( a hormone released by the pancreas ) produced. \nWithout insulin, energy (sugar) from food cannot enter the cells. Instead of fueling the cells, this excess sugar circulates in the blood causing high blood sugar levels (also known as hyperglycemia ). \nIf there is no insulin to shuttle blood sugar into the cells, excess blood sugar increases critically and this is called, diabetic ketoacidosis (as opposed to nutritional ketosis in DKA severe high blood sugar shifts the blood from having a more neutral ph to more acidic). \nConstant high blood sugar increases risk of diabetes complications such as kidney, nerve and eye disease, heart disease and stroke. Maintaining blood sugar as close to normal is the goal to avoid these complications. What Are the Symptoms of Type 1 Diabetes? \nUntil one is diagnosed and lying in a hospital bed, it is unlikely the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes will be recognized. This is why especially for those with a family history being aware of the symptoms is crucial. If you notice any of these symptoms, schedule a doctor's visit immediately. Extreme thirst Behavior changes (moody, less tolerant) Drowsiness, fatigue or lethargy Increased appetite coupled with weight loss Sudden weight loss Fruity odor on the breath Nausea and vomiting Is There a Cure for type 1 Diabetes? \nThere is no cure for Type 1 diabetes. A ketogenic lifestyle can help avoid blood sugar fluctuations and optimize quality of life. Living With Type 1 Diabetes \nSelf care is of the utmost importance in the successful management of type 1 diabetes. Coordinating life skills (activity, nutrition, blood sugar monitoring, medication) along with increased awareness of low blood sugar symptoms, math and analytical skills helps to keep blood sugar within target range. Less than one-third of people with T1D in the U.S. are achieving target blood glucose control ( 5 ). \nType 1 diabetes can be a life-long burden; but truthfully consistency and commitment makes living with diabetes much easier. What you eat has a significant impact on blood sugar and insulin injection. Why is Type 1 Diabetes Difficult to Manage? \nAccording to Keith Runyan ( expert interview ), there are two main underlying factors as to why Type 1 diabetes is difficult to manage: 1. High Variability of Absorption of Carbohydrates \nDigestion and absorption of the different types of carbohydrates (rapid and slow available glucose, or processed) are almost impossible to time. ( 7 ) \nThere may be as much as a 50% variation in carbohydrate absorption from various types of carbohydrates. If you miss that peak blood sugar window of opportunity, the insulin will not be as effective, or work as expected, therefore resulting in high, low or just not ideal blood sugar levels. 2. High Variability of Absorption of Insulin \nInjected insulin can have as much as a 30% variability in absorption. How is one to determine this factor? Again, this is not easily determined, and in fact extremely difficult. Why Following a Low Carb Approach Works for Type 1 Diabetes \nIn essence, the high variability of absorption for both food and insulin makes it almost impossible to target treatment. If you lower carbohydrates and thus lower insulin the variability is less and there is a much better chance you will hit target blood sugar. Managing Type 1 Diabetes with the Ketogenic Diet \nHealth risks for people living with type 1 diabetes significantly decline with consistent and normal blood sugar levels. Life expectancy can also be similar to those without diabetes. \nA ketogenic diet helps improve quality of life of patients living with type 1 diabetes. While low blood sugar is a concern, it seems those who use a ketogenic diet find the low blood sugar is much more manageable (vs. the low resulting from an over bolus of insulin) because the symptoms are not as overwhelming and mental acuity is not affected. \nConsensus amongst type 1 keto dieters seems to be to treat a low blood sugar with one standard glucose tab that provides 4-5 grams of carbohydrates (the total amount will depend on your situation and how low the blood sugar number is) to provide a necessary steady reliable rise in blood. How to Follow the Ketogenic Diet to Manage Type 1 Diabetes? \nAlthough not relatively new, using a ketogenic diet to treat type 1 diabetes is becoming more popular. Work with a knowledgeable healthcare professional when attempting to switch from a high to lower carbohydrate diet to help select the appropriate foods and manage insulin dose. \nDr. Richard Bernstein uses a very low carb ketogenic diet of 30 grams of carbohydrates to manage his and his patients' blood sugar. He found that his blood sugar would stay in the normal range when he minimized his insulin injections consuming carbohydrate regimen as follows: 6 grams for breakfast ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "keith runyan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard bernstein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "low carb approach works", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "absorption of carbohydrates  digestion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ketogenic diet  health", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-23T01:44:44.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d4785ff7f2ffd1ca168c433710f64b30918f5219", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQjeR4M7r2pTZygN2J.2Wqk5GWHC7QK7T473j4JgsNxS1UrnrmZUpgJvzdWXVsBnzNRPIyJzrgnrzt587AkgRASu0.RjuyTKg-", "site_full": "ketodietapp.com", "site": "ketodietapp.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Low-Carb Black Widow Cocktail | The KetoDiet Blog", "title_full": "Low-Carb Black Widow Cocktail | The KetoDiet Blog", "published": "2017-10-25T16:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "http://ketodietapp.com/Blog/image.axd?picture=/2017/10/BlackWidowCocktail-9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 56734, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d4785ff7f2ffd1ca168c433710f64b30918f5219", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQjeR4M7r2pTZygN2J.2Wqk5GWHC7QK7T473j4JgsNxS1UrnrmZUpgJvzdWXVsBnzNRPIyJzrgnrzt587AkgRASu0.RjuyTKg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-25T16:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Low-Carb Black Widow Cocktail | The KetoDiet Blog", "text": "Follow us 49.5k This spooky low-carb cocktail is perfect for Halloween!

Find out more Instructions First, prepare the brownie base. Preheat the oven to 350 F (175 C). Break the chocolate into small pieces and add to a heatproof bowl with the butter. Place over a pan filled with simmering water and make sure the water doesn\u2019t touch the bowl: only the steam should heat the bowl. Slowly melt while stirring. When most of the chocolate is melted, remove the pan from the burner and let the mixture continue to melt while stirring. The chocolate mixture should not be hot when added to the dough. Place the eggs, liquid stevia, and powdered erythritol into a bowl and whisk until well combined. Beat in the chocolate mixture and gently fold in the almond flour, cacao powder, ground chia seeds, baking soda, and cream of tartar and process well. Cut 2 circles in grease proof paper, the size to cover the base of your 20 x 20 cm (8 x 8 inch) sandwich tins and place at the bottom. Grease the sides with a little oil to prevent sticking. Spoon \u2154 of the mixture into one tin and the remaining \u2153 into the other. Bake in the oven for 16 - 22 minutes. Check the smaller cake after 16 minutes. As it\u2019s thinner it will take slightly less time to cook. The cakes are done when you can insert and remove a skewer without the mixture sticking and are not to soft to touch. Once both are cooked remove from the oven and allow to cool fully. Remove from the cake tins and place on a wire rack. Using a large sharp knife cut the larger cake horizontally to form 2 layers. This will give you 3 layers in total. Whip the cream and yoghurt to a thick, stiff consistency either using a stand mixer or a hand mixer . If using a stand mixer, place the bowl in the freezer for 10 minutes to chill. Do not over beat to prevent splitting. Place one of the cake bases on a serving plate. Spread with half the cream filling and scatter with half the berries. Top with the next layer of brownie cake and repeat the above step adding the cream and berries. Finish with the top layer of brownie. Enjoy!

Cook on medium-low for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until caramelised. Add the brown sugar substitute and stir in. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring to prevent burning, and then take off the heat. Set aside. While the onion is cooking, preheat the oven to 200 C/ 400 F. Remove the cheese from the freezer. Using your hands, create two 200 g (7.1 oz) patties. Place a piece of cheese in the middle of each patty, and then wrap the meat around them. Make sure the cheese is covered so it doesn't ooze out while cooking. Grease an ovenproof skillet with about a tablespoon of ghee. Add the burgers and cook on high for a minute on each side and season with salt. Place the skillet into the oven and bake for 7-8 minutes.

Over the past century though, there has been a significant decrease in magnesium intake ( 1 ). \nThe recommended nutrient intake per day for magnesium is between 300-400 mg/day ( 2 ). \nAs discussed in this previous article , those following a low carbohydrate diet can experience transient drops in the level of magnesium in the body. This loss of magnesium is what can result in \"keto-flu\" symptoms including: headaches, cramps, heart arrhythmias and low blood pressure. \nAlthough there is an abundance of low carbohydrate foods that are high in magnesium, some people will still need to get a little extra help reaching the RDA. Knowing When to Supplement \nIf after a couple of weeks on a low carbohydrate diet, you find that you are still experiencing muscle cramps or soreness as well as any heart arrhythmia\u2019s (often described as a heart flutter), then these can be the signs that your body is still lacking in magnesium. This can be especially true if you exercise a lot. Which Supplements to Choose? \nMinerals such as magnesium must be combined with another molecule to make it stabilised for supplementation. There exists a range of magnesium supplements all with varying absorption, bioavailability and therapeutic inputs within the body. \nThis makes some supplements better for the body than others. Below is an overview of which magnesium supplements to choose and which to try and avoid. Good Sources of Magnesium Supplements: Use Magnesium Glycinate \nMagnesium is bound to glycinate which is a non-essential amino acid. This is one of the most bio-available form of magnesium meaning it is better absorbed by the body. Unlike other magnesium supplements it also does not cause gastrointestinal problems including diarrhoea ( 3 ). \nDue to the calming nature of glycinate, this supplement has specifically been shown to help decrease muscle pain ( 4 ). As well as helping with specific fatigue illnesses including fibromyalgia ( 5 ) and chronic fatigue syndrome ( 6 ). \nRecommended by Martina @ KetoDiet: Doctor's Best (Amazon affiliate link) Magnesium Citrate \nThis is one of the most common forms of magnesium supplements available. Magnesium citrate has good bioavailability particularly in relation to magnesium oxide ( 7 ). It is also a lot cheaper than the glycinate form. \nSince citric acid is a mild laxative, this type of magnesium supplement can cause a loosening of stools ( 8 ). Therefore, this form of supplement would be suitable for those who may be experiencing constipation whilst on their low carbohydrate diet. \nRecommended by Martina @ KetoDiet: Calm (Amazon affiliate link) Magnesium Chloride \nMagnesium chloride is often used in over the counter medications for digestive disorders such as GORD ( 9 ). The chloride bound to the magnesium can help to produce more hydrochloric acid (HCL) in the stomach. \nThis type of supplement is better suited for those who are suffering from digestive issues, especially involving low acid production. \nRecommended by Martina @ KetoDiet: Slow-Mag Magnesium Chloride tablets and Pure Zechstein Magnesium Chloride Bath Flakes (Amazon affiliate links) Magnesium Malate \nThis form of magnesium supplement is paired with malic acid. Whilst it is commonly found in fruits, malic acid in an integral molecule involved in the Krebs cycle. This is where most of your energy is generated for the body to function. Many studies have looked at the use of magnesium malate in fatigue syndromes such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome ( 10 , 11 ). \nMagnesium malate would therefore be of benefit to people who are experiencing symptoms of extreme fatigue. \nRecommended by Martina @ KetoDiet: Source Naturals Magnesium Malate (Amazon affiliate link) Magnesium Taurate \nBoth magnesium and the amino acid Taurine, have been shown to help with cardiovascular health ( 12 ). \nTaurine itself is a very calming amino acid and L-Taurine is available as a nootropic compound which has been shown to help improve cognition and memory. For this reason, people believe that magnesium taurate is the better form of magnesium supplement for brain health. \nRecommended by Martina @ KetoDiet: Cardiovascular Research Magnesium Taurate (Amazon affiliate link) Transdermal Magnesium \nAlso known as magnesium sprays or oils, this type of magnesium is placed topically onto the skin. The magnesium is then absorbed across the skin and into the circulation to help raise the serum level. A pilot study showed that spraying 56 mg/day onto the skin provided a clinically relevant rise in the serum level of magnesium in the body after 2 weeks ( 13 ). \nThis type of magnesium is particularly good for people who experience symptoms of leg cramp and muscle soreness. The exact dose will range from products but are set at 5-30 sprays/day or 2-4 tsp of magnesium cream. \nRecommended by Martina @ KetoDiet: Pure Zechstein Magnesium Oil Spray (Amazon affiliate link) Magnesium Salts/Baths \nLike with transdermal magnesium, magnesium salts work by absorbing into the skin and entering the circulation. There are various types of salts, but the most common is that of Epsom salts, otherwise known as magnesium sulphate. As well as being good for sore or aching muscles, this type of magnesium can also be used as a relaxant. Low levels of magnesium have been linked to heightened stress ( 14 ). \nIt is recommended for this type of magnesium supplementation to fill a hot bath with 1-2 cups of Epsom salt and immerse the whole body for a minimum of 20 minutes to reap the benefits. \nRecommended by Martina @ KetoDiet: Epsoak Epsom Salt (Amazon affiliate link) Poor Forms of Magnesium Supplements \nThe below options of magnesium supplements are less favourable forms of magnesium and where possible should be avoided. Magnesium Oxide \nAlthough this supplement is the most common form of magnesium, it has a very low bioavailability. This means that it is not well absorbed by the body. It also has an extreme laxative effect. Magnesium oxide is commonly used as a laxative in patients with constipation ( 15 ). Magnesium Aspartate \nThis is also known as magnesium l-aspartate. The jury is a little out on if this is a good or bad source of magnesium. This form of magnesium has increased bioavailability compared to others ( 16 ). Some people think that because it contains the name aspartate in it that this is the same as the artificial sweetener aspartame. However, aspartic acid is in fact an amino acid and a neurotransmitter in the body. This type of magnesium supplement is actually very difficult to find and purchase. General Guidance on Magnesium Supplementing \nAs you can see there are a lot of different options when it comes to that of magnesium supplementation. If you are going to be taking oral magnesium, then try and stick to the good sources. If you find that you suffer a lot more from muscle soreness and cramps, then using a transdermal or magnesium salt option would be a lot better. How and When to Take It \nThe normal dosing for oral magnesium is around 200-400 mg/day ( 17 ). This dosing would normally also be taken just once per day (i.e. not spaced throughout the day). \nIt is generally better to take magnesium along with food to mitigate any potential side effects. \nIf taking transdermal magnesium, then stick to the guidelines for the given source and do not go over the stated dose. \nFor Epsom salts, a 20-minute magnesium salt bath once per week has been shown to offer significant benefits. Common Side Effects \nAlthough there are some good and bad sources of magnesium, all the sources can cause some unwanted side effects if the stated dose is exceeded. The most common side effects are: Diarrhoea Abdominal cramps Bloating \nAlthough the gastrointestinal side effects listed above can be caused by all the forms of magnesium, generally magnesium oxide and chloride are the ones that have the biggest impact on the gut. Take Home Message \nFor many people on a low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet, low magnesium status can be common. First, ensure that you are getting as much of your magnesium sources from your food as you can. If you are still experiencing side effects, then supplementing would be recommended.
