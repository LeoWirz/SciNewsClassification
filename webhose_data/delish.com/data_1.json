Most Popular By Madison Flager Oct 3, 2017 With the amount of sugar in many protein bars, it's fair to say some are basically glorified candy bars. Mars is blurring that line even further with Protein By Mars , a line of protein-packed candy bars that includes Snickers, Mars, Milky Way, and Bounty. The bars apparently taste just like your favorite candy bars, but have the added bonus of 18 to 19 grams or protein and just under 200 calories per serving , which is pretty on par with most other protein bars.

The Snickers bar uses a similar protein blend that's mixed in with the classic peanuts and caramel coated in milk chocolate. A post shared by Andrea Rollini (@rollini) on Sep 19, 2017 at 2:08am PDT Most Popular A post shared by Rosehill Mart (@rosehill_mart) on Aug 22, 2017 at 4:16am PDT The bars are surprisingly low in sugar too; one serving of the Snickers Protein bar has 9 grams of sugar, and the Mars bar has 13 grams. Compare that to the regular bars, which have 27 grams and 21 grams, respectively, and you're definitely better off picking the protein version when in need of a chocolate fix. Before you run to the grocery store, these puppies are only solid in U.K. stores as of now. BUT, you can find them on Amazon , hallelujah. While the official branded product doesn't ship to the U.S., plenty of other sellers have the bars listed. Mars also makes candy bars like Twix and Three Musketeers, so here's hoping all the best candy bars get protein-ified soon (and come to America).

Courtesy of Spicy Southern Kitchen Advertisement Someone made a candy corn pizza and the Internet is unhappy \nCandy corn-inspired desserts are way better than actual candy, and it's no secret that we love our fried food , so blogger Christin from Spicy Southern Kitchen 's deep fried candy corn recipe seems like it would be right up our sugar and grease coated alleys (yeah, we know you're judging us hard right now). Melted candy corn is covered in a fried dough ball and sprinkled with powdered sugar, which sounds all kinds of gooey, crispy, and basically delicious. Courtesy of Spicy Southern Kitchen \nBut if you're still weirded out by the idea, just think of it as a corn fritter. And corn fritters are insanely good. So candy corn fritters must be too, right?

Getty RJ Sangosti By Danielle Jackson Oct 5, 2017 Bargain shoppers everywhere let out a collective sigh of relief when Whole Foods announced that the company would be cutting prices after being acquired by Amazon . But even though the notoriously overpriced grocery chain has marked down a handful of popular items like avocados, eggs, and almonds, new data gathered by research firm Gordon Haskett shows that some prices may be creeping back up. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below According to The Washington Post , the firm tracked the prices on 110 items at a Whole Foods in New Jersey starting on Aug. 28 when Amazon officially bought the company out. Though it was found that, on average, prices have gone down 1.2 percent since then, the end of the five week tracking period saw the rise in prices on select items. Frozen foods, for example, were priced seven percent higher on Sept. 28 than they were the previous month. In addition, the costs of snack items rose by 5.3 percent while the cost of dairy items rose by two percent. But the good news is that you don't have to freak out just yet, because the analysis of the firm's data isn't to say that we'll soon have to kiss these lower prices goodbye. Of the 110 items looked at, the prices on 77 of them stayed the same while 16 items increased and 17 decreased. Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods has proven to be beneficial for both companies in the last month. On top of stealing foot traffic from other beloved grocery chains like Trader Joe's, Whole Foods has raked in over well over $1 million in sales on Amazon's website since the announcement.

Most Popular By Sarah Weinberg 06 October, 2017 When you're a woman or man in love , the question you get asked most often is \"When did you know?\" \u2014 as in, when did you know this was it? When you're a wedding planner, the question you're constantly asked is the same \u2014 but the meaning's a whole lot different. Here's the exact moment five wedding planners knew their clients wouldn't be celebrating too many anniversaries. The couple gets hammered at the wedding. Kayla McCaul, an Oregon-based planner, warned Huffington Post of brides and grooms who hit the alcohol a little to hard on their big day: \"Pacing yourself on your wedding is key, but if you find yourself or your partner throwing back the cocktails before the ceremony begins, you may want to ask yourself, what is happening here?\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Popular One partner embarrasses the other. \"The guest count was roughly 100, but this cake could've easily served close to 300. Very elaborate and shipped in from New York from some high-end bakery. There was Chinese lettering/design on the cake, [\u2026] and it was apparent the groom had no idea what cake they were getting. [The bride] points out three of the symbols on the cake, which were the largest. She said that they meant 'Obey, Listen, and (I think) Service/Loyalty.' She said that she expected these three traits from her husband at all times. And not in a joking way.

An ex is still hanging around. \"The worst I've personally witnessed had a groom's baby mama (and ex-fianc\u00e9) come to the reception uninvited.

Courtesy of Le Creuset By Sarah Weinberg Oct 6, 2017 Le Creuset is a staple in the Delish test kitchen. You've probably seen the colorful pots and pans in a lot of our videos . But we're not the only fans: The iconic cookware is celebrated the world over \u2014 and for good reason. Here's a look at what makes Le Creuset cookware so special. 1. DON'T CALL IT A DUTCH OVEN. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below There's a difference: Dutch ovens were invented by the Pennsylvania Dutch in the 1700s. They were large cast-iron pots with fitted lids. The French tried to riff on them by adding enamel coating, but their new name (the ever-original French oven) didn't stick. Nevertheless, that is the proper name for your Le Creuset piece. 2. THE SIGNATURE COLOR HAS HIDDEN IMPORTANCE. Getty The Washington Post The brand's casting specialist Armand Desaegher and enameling specialist Octave Aubecq settled on a bright orange color for their first enameled oven in 1925 and named it Flame. They were inspired by the bright glow of molten cast-iron. Even the factory in Fresnoy-le-Grand, France, is painted the classic orange hue. 3. MARILYN MONROE WAS A HUGE FAN. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The blonde bombshell was an avid cook and owned a 12-piece set of Le Creuset cookware in Elysees Yellow, a color that's since been discontinued. It was auctioned for a whopping $25,330 in New York in 1999. 4. NO TWO PIECES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME. Each piece of cookware is cast from a fresh sand mold that's broken back down into sand after its use. The cast pieces are then smoothed by hand and enameled. And that's the simplified version: The process can take at least 10 hours and actually entails 12 different steps. 5. THE COOKWARE IS MORE VERSATILE THAN YOU THINK. Courtesy of Le Creuset You knew you could make a stew or cook a whole chicken in the classic French ovens, but you can also bake bread , braise meat, cook a casserole, and deep fry whatever the heck your heart desires in the classic piece. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 6. LE CREUSET HAS A STRICT NO-FLAW POLICY. Each pot is inspected by 15 different people before it's deemed suitable for sale. Around 30 percent of the company's goods are rejected because of imperfections. Often, they're melted back down and, the iron is recycled to create new (flawless) products. 7. YOU CAN GET THE BEST DEALS AT LE CREUSET OUTLET STORES. There are more than 70 outlet stores across the country that sell first-quality productions (ones in colors or shapes that may be discontinued) and second-quality items. The latter have minor imperfections that don't affect how they cook food but require them to be sold at a lower price. 8. ENAMELED CAST-IRON COOKWARE ISN'T THE ONLY THING THE COMPANY CAN MAKE. Courtesy of Le Creuset Advertisement - Continue Reading Below It may be the most popular, but you can also get Le Creuset stainless steel, silicone, and stoneware products. 9. POPULAR COLORS VARY BY COUNTRY. Currently, Le Creuset has created about 100 colors, but the favorites are different depending on where you live. Americans opt for primary hues, Germans love Mediterranean blues and Japanese chefs pick pastels. French cooks go crazy for \u2014 what else? \u2014 the iconic Flame hue, which is called Volcanique in Le Creuset's home country. 10. LE CREUSET'S FACTORY WORKERS STAY BUSY. The company turned 90 in 2015, and at that time, they'd created more than 300 million products for more than 60 different countries. 11. THE COMPANY IS KNOWN FOR ITS WHIMSICAL LIMITED EDITIONS. Williams Sonoma They've produced heart and flower-shaped pots in the past and cherry blossom-covered cookware in Japan. Le Creuset made Disney fans' wildest dreams come true with a blue soup pot painted with red roses to celebrate the release of the live-action Beauty and the Beast movie.

Courtesy of Netflix By Danielle Jackson Oct 7, 2017 If you love free coffee just as much as you love marathoning Gilmore Girls for hours on end, then my, oh my, do I have some news for you. The Gilmore Girls Fan Fest is coming back for another year, letting fans everywhere spend a long weekend in Stars Hollow. A post shared by Gilmore Girls Fan Fest (@gilmoregirlsfanfest) on Jun 21, 2017 at 2:24am PDT   Gilmore Girls Fan Fest, which was introduced by co-creators Jennie and Marcus Whitaker, gives you the chance to spend three days living like your favorite characters from the show. That means drinking lots and lots of coffee , attending a cake tasting, and even participating in a jam session where you can belt out the theme tune, \"Where You Lead,\" alongside Carole King's daughter, Louise Goffin. \"Last year we received an abundance of praise from everyone involved, from the fans to the cast, which made the decision to put on this year's festival easy for us,\" Marcus said in a release. \"Jennie and I have learned a lot from our time in Connecticut and for us, anytime you can have fun while learning something new you've done the right thing.\" A post shared by Gilmore Girls Fan Fest (@gilmoregirlsfanfest) on Jul 10, 2017 at 11:03am PDT   The event will take place on the weekend of Oct. 20 in Kent, Connecticut, AKA the town that inspired the series' creator Amy Sherman-Palladino to dream up the fictional Stars Hollow in the first place. \"Putting on an event that provides a light-hearted, joy-filled weekend for others and allows us to celebrate a lot of really talented people we admire is really rewarding in itself, but at the end of the day I'm a fan too so that's what makes this opportunity really special,\" says Jennie. If you can't make it Stars Hollow this year, don't fret.

Oliver worked with Land Rover's Special Vehicle Operations team to make what is most likely the coolest car any food-lover could have, and as he put it on Good Morning Britain , \"Camping will never be the same.\" The car has a ton of awesome features, but the coolest is probably the toaster , conveniently located between the driver and passenger seat next to the gear stick. Imagine how much better road trip Pop-Tarts would be if you could warm them up! If you're more of a toast and jelly kind of person, there's jam storage behind the climate controls up front, naturally.

The wheels can act as ice cream makers and butter churners, and an entire kitchen counter pulls out of the trunk, complete with a sink and plenty of prep space. In the same area, there is a pull-out knife drawer and a spice rack, not too far from the herb gardens hanging out of the rear windows. Most Popular As if that weren't enough, there's a full-on olive-oil dispenser that comes down from the trunk, because you can never have enough EVOO.

So much so, that the brand just announced that it's introducing a brand new milkshake featuring one your childhood favorites: Cinnamon Toast Crunch . According to a release, the shake will taste like \"a cup of cinnamon swirl bliss,\" which basically means that if you've ever gulped down the leftover milk after eating a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, you should expect the shake to taste just as heavenly as that. The new item will obviously include pieces of Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal and with sweet cinnamon-flavored syrup mixed in with a vanilla soft serve.

The brand introduced a Lucky Charms milkshake back in June, shortly after rolling out a similar milkshake using Froot Loops. Judging by how popular the beverages have been among customers, it wouldn't be a surprise if the cereal shakes just kept on coming.

Updated: 1:04 PM CDT Oct 9, 2017 Senior News Editor \nOn Saturday, McDonald's brought back a nostalgic favorite \u2014 but so many fans rushed to get the Szechuan Dipping Sauce, locations quickly ran out, leaving many people disappointed. Of course, fans cried foul on social media, and McDonald's says they'll get a second chance at the stuff this winter. The chain's Szechuan Dipping Sauce, which was originally sold as part of a Mulan promotion in 1998, got a second wind thanks to the show Rick and Morty , which featured the sauce in a recent episode. \"I want that Mulan McNugget sauce, Morty,\" Rick says in the episode. \"That's my series arc, Morty!

A packet of the stuff was going for $99,000 on eBay , and then McDonald's gave away three giant bottles to lucky fans on Twitter. (Naturally, one of those bottles sold for $15,000, to DJ Deadmau5.) A post shared by McDonald's (@mcdonalds) on Oct 6, 2017 at 5:03am PDT \nMcDonald's decided to bring it back for one day only on Saturday, October 7th as part of their launch of the Buttermilk Crispy Tenders. And fans came out in droves, lining up around the block at local locations to get a taste. \u2014 MyIndyMcDonalds (@MyIndyMcDonalds) October 7, 2017 \nBut the supply of Szechuan sauce was far too small to meet demand, and it was only available at participating restaurants. That led many fans to miss out on it and they were not quiet about it. USA Today reports that people who lined up for hours got angry after the supplies ran out nearly instantly in many locations. Crowds chanted, \"we want sauce,\" and police even had to show up to manage the crowds. The backlash on social media was swift, with hashtags like #SzechuanGate and # McFail going viral. Angry crowd chants \"We want sauce\" as police force them back. 1000+ people camped out to get #szechuansauce but McDonalds had 70 sauces... pic.twitter.com/wEaqC64Hln \u2014 Ian \ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc7d Sikes (@ianjsikes) October 7, 2017 Cops are at Wellington McDonalds where tons of angry people lined up for hrs for Rick and Morty Szechuan sauce only to learn they had none pic.twitter.com/3T272osid4 \u2014 Lulu Ramadan (@luluramadan) October 7, 2017 \nMcDonald's responded to the outrage with a new announcement: they would bring the sauce back this winter, in a much bigger way.

Thank you, a million times over. Between the costumes, the memes and the cross-state travel, you, the fans, showed us what you got. And our super-limited batch, though well-intentioned, clearly wasn't near enough to meet that demand. \"Not cool.\" We agree. So we're gonna make this right. In the last 24 hours, we've worked to open any portal necessary. And it worked. Szechuan Sauce is coming back once again this winter.

Why aren't closets like Cher's commonplace in 2017? (We are living in the future, aren't we?) And, most obviously, is that what really happens when you just dump a roll of cookie dough on a baking sheet and leave it in the oven? Advertisement Paramount Pictures/Giphy \nThe first two remain unanswered, but for the third, Delish decided to take matters into their own hands and test things out. For science. And to finally shed 22 years of curiosity. \nAs the video above proves, the cookie dough log doesn't stay in the same tube-like shape it came in once it's heated. It starts to spread out, getting crispy along the edges while staying gooey in the center. At 375 degrees \u00b0F, the cookie gets perfectly golden, without turning into a charred, blackened crisp. It basically becomes an oval-shaped cookie cake . \nWhile a plain ol' cookie cake is perfectly fine, Delish decided to top off the blob of sweetness by turning it into an epic sundae.

Now, a bakery in Arizona is giving us a new treat to obsess over, and it combines two of our favorite sweets. Toasted Mallow sells edible cookie dough swirled with marshmallow fluff, and it's definitely here to replace our spoonful-of-peanut-butter habit.

Launched in five \"hunting-centric\" states last time around, the requests to bring it back \u2013 and to a broader audience \u2013 led Arby's to add the sandwich to menus nationwide. Beginning (and possibly ending) October 21, the Venison Sandwich will be sold at all Arby's locations while supplies last.

The venison (that's deer meat, by the way) is marinated in garlic, salt, and pepper, then cooked for three hours until juicy. Most Popular Deer isn't exactly a widely-consumed meat in the U.S. outside of hunting areas, and Arby's is the first fast-food chain to offer it at a national level. According to Arby's Chief Marketing Officer Jim Taylor, the sandwich is \"a perfect example of the level of innovation coming from our teams and our commitment to creating experiences that guests can only get at Arby's.\" It's not feasible to source large enough quantities of venison from the U.S., so Arby's deer meat comes from New Zealand, where it is grass-fed and free-range. Taylor told WHAS it took a year to secure enough meat for the promotion, and he recommends customers get to Arby's early on the 21st if they want to try it. In case venison wasn't intriguing enough, three Arby's locations \u2013 one each in Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana \u2013 will serve a limited-edition Elk Sandwich on October 21, too. This sandwich is made with a tender elk steak and topped with blackberry port steak sauce and crispy onions.

Most Popular By Madison Flager Oct 12, 2017 There are a few foods that, under no circumstances, should be brought on a plane. Or a bus. Or pretty much any enclosed space you're about to be stuck in for awhile. Tuna fish, stinky cheese, and hard-boiled eggs rank high on this list. But when you're Martha Stewart, you can do whatever the heck you want, side-eyes be damned. Stewart spoke to the New York Times for its \"Carry-On\" travel column this week, and shared that her go-to plane snack is none other than hard-boiled eggs.

I take them for everybody I'm traveling with.\" (Hopefully they're pre-peeled, otherwise, that's got to be a pain to clean up \u2014 especially when there's turbulence.) At least she shares? Her other travel snacks are a little more tame scent-wise, but definitely fancier than our usual granola bars and candy routine. For long flights, she takes \"some very good food that I know I'll want to eat on the plane.\" This includes smoked salmon sandwiches on seven-grain bread, tabbouleh salad, or homemade yogurt with apple sauce (think she has to follow the 3-1-1 rule ?). Most Popular Basically, she comes prepared, because Martha doesn't waste her time with junk . \"I try to avoid plane food most of the time,\" Stewart said. \"I just don't find it very appetizing.\" Once she has landed, though, Stewart is all about exploring local food scenes. She said she's never tempted to stay in bed and order room service, preferring to be out and about when she travels. \"I find the best breakfast place in town,\" she says.

As the original cake features three layers decorated with pink, white, and black fondant topped off with an image of Minnie Mouse in what appears to be the form of a cookie, the copycat cake is decorated similarly though it's topped off by what looks like a fourth layer of cake sculpted to look like Minnie Mouse's head. So yeah, the cake sort of missed the mark \u2014 and fellow Reddit users definitely didn't miss the opportunity to let that be known.

Updated: 2:22 PM EDT Oct 13, 2017 Lifestyle Editor \nGuy Fieri 's wife, Lori, has been with the celebrity chef through it all: winning Food Network Star , filming 1,100-plus locations on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives ; even his long, short, and now-famous bleached hair phases. \nThe couple's been married for 22 years, but when Guy first met Lori, it was more like love at first fight. He was running a restaurant in Long Beach, California, and swooped in to do damage control when he realized he'd met his match. Advertisement \n\"Her friend had been let go from the restaurant, and they weren't supposed to be there,\" Fieri explained. \"I was talking to her friend and saying 'Hey, listen, wait a few weeks before you come in,' and standing behind her is this blue-eyed, blonde girl giving me this mean mug.\" Joe Corrigan \nLori wasn't having it, and immediately jumped to her friend's defense. \n\"She said, 'You can't make us leave,' and I was like, 'You don't have to.',\" he said. Guy asked them to keep a low profile. They agreed, and the three got to talking. Lori wasn't from Long Beach; she was just driving through the city to meet up with her friend as part of her cross-country move from Rhode Island to San Diego. \n\"She never made it to San Diego,\" Guy laughed. A post shared by Guy Fieri (@guyfieri) on Aug 24, 2017 at 6:28pm PDT \nEven while Lori was glaring at him, he knew there was something different about her; he had to get to know her. \"I knew as soon as I saw her,\" he said. \"I just knew.\" \nNaturally, the Guy's Grocery Games host did what he does best to win her over \u2014 and no, it didn't involve picking her up in a red Camaro and taking her to the nearest greasy spoon. He cooked. Just don't ask him what, exactly. \n\"That was a long time ago. I don't remember what I made, but I do remember it was quite an epic time,\" he said. \"The first time I cooked for her, she was just like, 'You made all this?' We both love food, so being able to cook, that was one of the things that impressed her.\" \n\"I knew as soon as I saw her. I just knew.\" \nThe two have been together ever since. Guy credits his wife with being game to tackle every project or crazy idea he's had over the years \u2014 like the time he decided to take over a cruise ship's kitchen and flip burgers for hundreds of people. \nThe Fieri family \u2014 Guy, Lori, and their two sons \u2014 had been invited on the ship when Carnival tried to sell the chef on opening a restaurant on one. Initially, he wasn't sold on the idea. At all. \n\"I am the least likely person you'd ever catch on a cruise. I'm an outdoors guy. I don't like big crowds,\" he explained. \"But when this opportunity came up, my dad \u2014 who's the wise philosopher of the family \u2014 asked, 'Have you ever been on one? Then quit telling people you don't like it!'\" Getty Desiree Navarro \nGuy took his dad's words to heart, so he decided to go. And after dinner one night, had the sort of lightbulb moment that could make any wife eye-roll so hard she gives herself a headache. \n\"I said, 'I want to do a pop-up restaurant on this ship.' The bigwigs thought I was crazy, but they agreed, and I rallied all my boys to help out,\" he said. A post shared by Guy Fieri (@guyfieri) on Aug 24, 2017 at 4:32pm PDT \nLori also thought he was out of his mind, Guy said, but she cheered him on. \n\"In three hours, we served 700 burgers to I don't know how many people,\" he said.\"It got out of control; they had to come in and start putting up barriers because people were going so crazy.\" \nThey wound up having such a good time they decided to sign on the dotted line. (To date, the Fieris have launched 19 restaurants on Carnival's cruise ships , including an upcoming beer-and-BBQ-themed joint, Guy's Pig & Anchor Smokehouse Brewhouse, set to open on Carnival Horizon in May 2018.) \nIt seems it's that mutual support and down-to-try-anything mentality that's been the key to their marriage over the years. And, apparently, their willingness to butt heads \u2014 then talk it out.

No, seriously. They come in little sachets (or you can buy a whole jar if you're really committed to enhancing one aspect of your life) and you can choose from Brain, Beauty, Spirit, Dream, Sex, and Power. Each one has different superherbs targeted towards the desired result, and you add them to your smoothies, coffee, tea, cereal, etc., whenever you need a boost. Some you're supposed to feel instantly (Power, Brain, for example), while something like Beauty is going to take regular, consistent use. Courtesy of Moon Juice Advertisement - Continue Reading Below As far as the ingredients go\u2014they're actually legit. The superherbs in each dust vary, but research proves that these dusts are probably more than just hype. Peal extract, used in the Beauty dust, has been found to decrease inflammation and even inhibit dermatitis, according to a 2015 study . Cordyceps mushrooms, found in the Power dust, are proven to decrease fatigue . Chamomile has long been known to combat insomnia , so it's no surprise to see it in the Dream dust, and the Reishi Mushroom Extract in the Spirit dust deserves a mention, too. It's been proven in a 2011 study to improve emotional well-being.

As someone who genuinely loves the taste of black coffee, that was a very sad morning for me.)

In all fairness, seeing an effect on your skin isn't going to happen overnight, and you're probably looking more at a 1-2 month commitment to the supplement.

Brain: I'm generally pretty fast-paced and productive when it comes to my job, and after taking this one morning before work, I didn't really feel any more inspired or creative or driven.

Within 30 minutes, I felt a sense of calm\u2014nothing drastic, and if you aren't generally anxious, you probably wouldn't notice a difference\u2014but it was noticeable to me, and of all the dusts, this is the one I was most impressed with.

Just a few weeks after releasing Nightmare Before Christmas-themed popcorn buckets and a Bat Wing Raspberry Sundae , Disneyland is now selling a seasonal, Halloween-themed cocktail (because who said Disneyland was just for kids?) complete with a glowing ice cube and an eyeball. If you have plans to visit the theme park at any point between now and Halloween, you can buy the ghostly drink at Disneyland's Cove Bar restaurant . Unlike every other cocktail on the restaurant's menu, the drink doesn't boast a special name, as it only goes by the \"Halloween Specialty Cocktail.\" But just because its name is ordinary doesn't mean that the drink itself is.

Inside of the drink is where customers will find one glowing ice cube and an \"eyeball\" that's really just a colored maraschino cherry stuffed inside of a lychee. As an added touch, the cocktail glass its served in is also rimmed with purple sugar crystals.

Getty Desiree Navarro By Candace Braun Davison Oct 17, 2017 In the days since Guy Fieri set up camp with his friends at Veterans Memorial Building in Sonoma, California, his team's been cooking around the clock, preparing 5,000 meals a day for evacuees and volunteers. Fieri's been working with Salvation Army, setting up a donations page to raise money for those in need.   \"This ordeal is far from over and the need is only growing,\" Fieri wrote in a statement. While firefighters are starting to gain ground, the wildfire has destroyed more than 5,700 homes and businesses and killed at least 40 people, making it the deadliest in California's history . The moment Fieri heard the news, he stopped what he was doing. \"I changed my plans. I told my friends that my hometown is having a crisis. I started my restaurants there,\" he told Refinery29 late last week. \"I've got a lot of people coming together and a lot of great chefs are going to come and help. We're going to make people happy. We're going to give them a little moment. I think food is always \u2014 we call it comfort food because it makes you feel good. \"In these times that we're facing as a country, it's so trying. But that's the example I set for my sons: You stand up; you face it; and you go after it. You don't back down from it.\" You can donate to the Northern California Wildfire Relief Efforts here . ORIGINAL POST: Oct. 13, 2017 at 1:06 p.m. EST In the wake of a series of wildfires that swept through northern California earlier this week, Guy Fieri took a trip to a fire-damaged Sonoma County on Thursday, but don't think he showed up empty handed. The celebrity chef brought with him a CBS television crew and a mobile barbecue oven that he set up in the parking lot of the Veterans Memorial Building in an effort to feed evacuees affected and displaced by the fires. Just finished chatting with @GuyFieri . The first thing he says: \u201cwho\u2019s behaving badly\u201d! Actually it\u2019s #PeopleHelpingPeople #SantaRosa #Fires pic.twitter.com/XbtwKEBSPK \u2014 Stanley Roberts (@SRobertsKRON4) October 13, 2017   The Santa Rosa native spoke to KQED on the scene of the operation on Thursday, stating that the entire crew had already fed around 1,200 volunteers, evacuees, and first responders by lunch time, and that they expected to have well over 2,000 meals cooked by the end of the night. \"This isn't a PR stunt,\" he said. \"You don't see my banners up. I'm not promoting anything. I'm just here cooking. This is feeding people. People need help, and I'm here to help. That's it.\" According to Fieri, he and his wife were awakened by the smoke from the fires before they evacuated their Santa Rosa home on Monday morning. \"The smoke was really bad,\" he said. \"We had to evacuate at two in the morning, and we grabbed what we could, taking pictures off the wall as fast as we could. Jumped in the truck, loaded in the dogs, and away we went.\" The 49-year-old chef and his wife apparently live just a few blocks away from a neighborhood that was completely destroyed by the wildfires, which is what originally triggered his decision to reach out to the Salvation Army for help. It's not clear how long Fieri plans to stay and help, as the firestorm has been blazing through the area for almost a week now, but hopefully the chef will be able to continue his efforts throughout the weekend.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "guy fieri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty desiree navarro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanley roberts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "candace braun davison", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salvation army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kqed", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "flavortown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fieri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "veterans memorial building", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonoma county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa rosa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T20:35:50.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0600395468d7a885387f61112e6072175ede9702", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_UeK.PGhEXDjoTvHk.E3s9Bsn_qjCzfzYPrJdgnoF6Y.60LTEOd0VITdgf3vxFPWWz4uNipFfQrM3.y2LwWAXFQo.poDx1OuA-", "site_full": "www.delish.com", "site": "delish.com", "site_section": "http://www.wtae.com/9682070?format=rss_2.0&view=feed", "site_categories": ["food"], "section_title": "Top Stories", "title": "You can make delicious pasta with just two ingredients", "title_full": "You can make delicious pasta with just two ingredients", "published": "2017-10-17T20:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://hips.htvapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/17/42/1600x900/hd-aspect-1508160936-delish-two-ingredient-fettucine-still001.jpg?resize=1200:*", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5183, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0600395468d7a885387f61112e6072175ede9702", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_UeK.PGhEXDjoTvHk.E3s9Bsn_qjCzfzYPrJdgnoF6Y.60LTEOd0VITdgf3vxFPWWz4uNipFfQrM3.y2LwWAXFQo.poDx1OuA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-17T20:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "You can make delicious pasta with just two ingredients", "text": "{copyShortcut} to copy Link copied!

In a medium, heatproof bowl, melt mozzarella in microwave, 1 minute to 1 minute 30 seconds. Stir in egg yolks, one at a time, until completely incorporated. If mixture begins to harden, microwave for 20 seconds more. \n2. Grease two pieces of parchment paper with cooking spray. Place pasta mixture between prepared sheets and roll with a rolling pin until about \u00bc\u201d thick. Using a knife or pizza cutter, slice into fettuccine-sized noodles. Transfer to a flat surface, and refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours or up to overnight. \n3. To cook: In a large pot of salted, boiling water, cook pasta, about 45 seconds - 1 minute. Drain and return to pot. \n4. Serve with warm marinara and garnish with basil and Parmesan. \nForget everything you know about making pasta. All you need is mozzarella and eggs. \nTo make the fettuccine, simply roll out the mixture between two pieces of parchment paper then use a knife to make long strips. The hardest part: Waiting while you let the noodles hang out in the refrigerator for 4 hours. Thankfully, once properly chilled, they only take about a minute to cook in boiling water. \nWe served our pasta with marinara, parm and basil. But they're even amazing with just a little bit of butter and freshly ground black pepper. Or, of course, tossed in alfredo sauce. You do whatever you want and feel good about it. Because you're living your best low-carb life, in all its cheesy glory.

By Madison Flager Oct 17, 2017 Snickers has dabbled in specialty flavors \u2014 cookies, almond, and \"crunchers\" have come out, to name a few \u2014 but compared to brands like Oreo, which seems to pop out a new flavor every week, the classic candy tends to stick to its roots. That's what made the announcement of three new specialty flavors all the more surprising: It's the first time the brand has debuted so many flavors at once, and they're announcing it months ahead of time. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Next June, Fiery, Salty and Sweet, and Espresso-flavored Snickers will be available in stores for a limited time. Playing off the \"You're not you when you're hungry\" campaign , each flavor corresponds to a mood the Snickers can fix. If you're feeling wimpy, grab the fiery bar. Indecisive? Salty and sweet it is. And when you're irritable, espresso apparently does the trick. Though the candy won't be on shelves for quite some time, Delish editors got a sneak preview of the new flavors, and had plenty of opinions to share. Here's the general consensus: Most Popular FIERY The new bars all have peanuts, caramel, and milk chocolate; it's the nougat that's infused with a new flavor. The fiery bar has a hot pepper nougat, though some editors thought it had more of a chili flavor than pepper. One editor described it as the friend that you think is really cool, then unexpectedly shows up to a party WAY too drunk. The flavor definitely sneaks up on you, but if you like red hots, you'll probably enjoy this flavor. \"That's something you wouldn't give to your enemies.\" \"It's a little irritating.\" SALTY & SWEET This bar's nougat is salted-caramel flavored. Some people got a bite of sea salt, but otherwise, thought it tasted pretty similar to a normal Snickers. It's the friend you didn't really invite to the party, but will talk to anyway. \"It's definitely more salty than sweet.\" \"It's literally the same.\" ESPRESSO Finally, there's the espresso flavor. Editors were split on this one; some (myself included) thought it had a strong coffee taste, others thought it tasted like a normal Snickers. One outlier thought it tasted like a buttered popcorn Jelly Belly, which could be a good thing. \"If you like coffee, you'll like the espresso.\" \"Espresso is like coffee breath.\" All in all, none of the new flavors were particularly amazing \u2014 it's hard to top the original, after all \u2014 but they're interesting enough to warrant a try.

Jon Boulton Advertisement - Continue Reading Below These Reese's bats check all the boxes: delicious, adorable and super easy. Not to mention they're a total blast to make with kids! You only need four ingredients: mini Reese's, Oreos, peanut butter, and candy eyes. To start, separate the Oreo cookies from the cream. (What you do with the cream is entirely up to you.) Next, slice them in half. There may be some casualties as Oreos can be a bit crumbly, I suggest using a serrated paring knife. Next, attach them to your Reese's with a dab of peanut butter. Apply the same peanut butter method for the eyes and you've got your bats! Jon Boulton We found that kids have a proclivity to adding more than two eyes to the bats. We say, go for it! The spookier the better. No matter how many eyes, they'll disappear in no time. PIN IT FOR LATER: Download the Delish app today. Follow Delish on Instagram .

Most Popular By Danielle Jackson Oct 20, 2017 Mac and cheese is pretty much the comfort food that trumps all comfort foods . On top of being downright delicious, it's pretty simple to prepare and can easily please a crowd full of people. Well, at least when it's made the right way, unlike this mac and cheese that Twitter spent all of Thursday ridiculing to no end. It all started when a user named Jan Levinson used the app to share a photo of the mac and cheese that one of her co-worker's brought to their company's potluck. The photo shows a dish filled with cooked macaroni noodles with shredded cheese mixed in . It's not melted, just mixed.

It sounds like a weird pregnancy craving that's gotten WAY out of hand. But I promise that the cupcake itself is not that bad. With about half the sugar of a normal cupcake, it's not very sweet which makes the dill and chopped pickles not soooo weird. Think of it like a muffin with a fluffier cupcake crumb. Alexa Payesko Advertisement - Continue Reading Below But things got really weird with the frosting. We couldn't decide what would taste delicious on a cake made with pickle juice. Peanut butter? Chocolate? Vanilla buttercream? The answer: maybe nothing. We tried though. The kitchen team voted that a not-so-sweet cream cheese frosting would be best. And when our amazing test kitchen assistant Makinze suggested a splash of bourbon too (picklebacks, duh!), we thought the combo was a sure-fire win. Taste testers, however, were mostly confused. They didn't know what to think. Most didn't exactly dislike like it, but they preferred the cupcake sans frosting. Maybe pickle cupcakes were meant to be chasers.

Most Popular By Madison Flager Oct 22, 2017 Kourtney Kardashian is known for maintaining a super-strict diet, both for herself and her kids. As she's talked about on her family's show and social media, she doesn't eat gluten or dairy and avoids sugar as much as possible. She recently shared on her app that she's pretty particular about how she eats her food, too. In a post on her website and app, Kardashian shared the one appliance she removed from her home for good: a microwave. The decision dates back to her first pregnancy with seven-year-old Mason. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below While doing \"health-related research,\" Kardashian found out that plastic containers can leak toxins into food when heated in the microwave. She thought about switching to glass containers, but ultimately decided to forego the microwave altogether. \"I didn't want to risk having something reheated in plastic when I wasn't around,\" she wrote. Besides the health risk, Kardashian said another concern was that microwaves heat food unevenly. \"Microwaves can sometimes heat food unevenly, so some parts are scorching hot and others are cold, which is obviously a concern for babies and children,\" she said. \"When it comes to my family, I play it safe.\" Most Popular RELATED VIDEO: While microwaves are convenient at heating food up quickly, Kardashian says she finds it usually only takes a few more minutes in a toaster oven . She also uses a regular oven and stovetop to reheat food . According to a 2017 Harvard Medical School article, the original information that cancer-causing dioxins are leaking into your food in the microwave isn't quite accurate. Plastics don't contain dioxins, so it's only if you burn your food that they may be created. However, the article does still warn against using non-microwave-safe containers to reheat food , as well as take-out containers and plastic tubs. Additionally, it says \"Old, scratched, or cracked containers, or those that have been microwaved many times, may leach out more plasticizers.\" The FDA recommends using glass, ceramic, or plastic containers labeled for microwave oven use when reheating or heating foods in the microwave.

According to Tanya Zuckerbrot, R.D., creator of the F-Factor Diet, they each contain about 88 calories, 3 grams of carbs, and 1 gram of sugar per glass. Steer clear of marsala and sherry, though. Those glasses are loaded with 164 calories, 14 grams of carbs and 8 grams of sugar. Whites When it comes to lighter white wines, opt for chardonnay , white zinfandel or sauvignon blanc . Zuckerbrot notes that these picks are all under 85 calories, with 2.6 grams carbs and 1 gram of sugar per glass.

So, as tempting as it is to fill that giant balloon glass with a little somethin' extra, you should try to stay strict. \"Current research has linked drinking one glass (5oz) per day for women (two for men) to reducing your risk of a number of chronic diseases,\" says Jaclyn London, MS, RD, CDN , Nutrition Director at the Good Housekeeping Institute. \"Whichever type of vino you choose, just make sure you're staying on top of hydration (at least a glass of H2O for every glass of wine you have!) and avoiding mixed wine drinks with added sugar (like pre-made sangria or sugary alcohol mixers).

Word on the street is that Nabisco is releasing Oreo Thin Bites, a bite-sized version of Oreo Thins that are dipped in fudge. So now you'll be able to eat even more Oreos and not feel as guilty. Foodland , a grocery store based in Hawaii, shared a photo of the brand new snack via Instagram on Monday.

They will be available in Original, Mint, and Chocolate flavors. Huge thanks to @foodlandhi and @snackjunkiefinland for the info,\" the caption reads.

New Orleans media outlets said Besh's departure from the business he co-owns was announced to employees Monday. \"John has decided to step down from all aspects of operations and to provide his full focus on his family,\" Shannon White, the woman who is stepping in as CEO, said in an email to staff. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The allegations were published Saturday by NOLA.comThe Times Picayune after an eight-month investigation. Women interviewed said male bosses in the Besh Restaurant Group touched or verbally harassed them and, in a few cases, tried to leverage positions of authority for sex. Besh acknowledged a sexual relationship with an employee, saying in a written statement to NOLA.comThe Times-Picayune that it was consensual, despite the woman's assertions in a complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that she felt pressured. Most Popular The allegations came to light in a time when sexual harassment allegations have been made against other famous men, including Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, the late Fox News executive Roger Ailes and comedian Bill Cosby. Repercussions from the Besh story were being felt even before the allegations were published. Last month, Alon Shaya, a star chef who rose up through the Besh Group ranks, was dismissed as executive chef at Domenica, Pizza Domenica and his critically acclaimed namesake restaurant, Shaya. Shaya had contacted NOLA.com in August regarding his concerns on how sexual harassment allegations were handled. \"I do feel like I was fired for talking ... and for standing up,\" Shaya said in a follow-up interview Oct. 17. Current and former staff, meanwhile, said in the article and in social media that Shaya did not do enough to stop sexual harassment at the restaurants he ran. On Sunday, Harrah's New Orleans Casino said it was severing ties with Besh and would rename its Besh Steak restaurant in the casino. Nine women interviewed for the NOLA.com story agreed to the use of their names, including Madie Robison. \"After being immersed in the culture of the company, I realize my morals and values do not align with the daily practices,\" Robison wrote in a resignation email, sent to Besh, his business partner Octavio Mantilla and others. In multiple interviews, Robison's complaints included persistent, sexualized comments from peers and supervisors. Robison claimed she also endured the uninvited touching of Mantilla for almost the entirety of her two years at the Besh Group. Mantilla said he doesn't remember touching Robison. \"I don't remember touching her at all, not on intention or anything,\" he said. A Besh Group spokesman said none of the thousands of current or former employees has ever filed an internal complaint alleging sexual harassment in the company's 12 years of existence. Besh and Mantilla said during an Oct. 16 interview that in the past the company had lacked a human resources department to process such claims. The company has one now - its first ever director of human resources took the job Oct. 11, the spokesman told NOLA.com. In his separate, written statement to NOLA.com, Besh said he was working to \"rebuild my marriage\" and publicly apologized to employees \"who found my behavior as unacceptable as I do.\" \"I alone am entirely responsible for my moral failings,\" he added. \"This is not the way the head of a company like ours should have acted, let alone a husband and father.\" Raymond Landry, an attorney for the restaurant group, gave the news outlet a written statement as well, not mentioning specific allegations, but saying the company is implementing a better procedure for receiving and dealing with complaints. \"While we've had a complaint procedure in place that complies with all existing laws, we now recognize that, as a practical matter, we needed to do more than what the law requires and we have revamped our training, education and procedures accordingly,\" Landry's statement said.

By Madison Flager Oct 25, 2017 McDonald's Monopoly is back in Canada, giving customers a chance to win prizes as elaborate as plane tickets, SUVs, and snowmobiles (Canada, ya know?). There are tons of smaller prizes, like free burgers and gift cards, and McDonald's says there is a 1 in 5 chance of winning every time you play. One Canadian vlogger decided to put those odds to the test by ordering a staggering 100 large fries at once, much to the dismay of every McDonald's employee working that day. He also ordered a large Diet Coke, just for good measure. Since each large fry and medium or large drink comes with two game stamps, that amounted to 202 chances to win. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below YouTube / Furious Pete \"Furious Pete\" was expecting to win at least 40 prizes, under the assumption that the odds were based on the number of stamps. As shown in the video, it didn't end quite as well as he hoped. After Pete and his wife went through all the monopoly pieces, they discovered they had a grand total of 23 prizes. Most of them were food prizes, meaning they won \"a lot of cheeseburgers,\" as he put it. In the video, Pete says this makes the odds about 1 in 9, which would be correct if each game stamp had a 1 in 5 chance of winning. However, the Official Rules of the game state that the chances of winning are actually based on the number of game pieces (1 piece = 2 stamps). So in that case, McDonald's was pretty accurate in their odds. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below McDonald's Canada After studying the rules a little too intensely, it appears that only the food prize has a 1 in 5 chance of being won, though; as the prize values go up, the odds go down. The chance of winning $10,000 in cash, for example, is 1 in 13 million. In all fairness, if we spent $340.68 on McDonald's, we'd expect to win something a little better than a free sandwich too.

That's what made it especially surprising when the company announced it's shuttering its online marketplace, Amazon Wine . Launched at the end of 2012, Amazon Wine was the original way to buy wine on Amazon, before grocery delivery and instant delivery came into play. It's got everything from Martha Stewart's wine line to the trendy wine-in-a-can, as well as mixed packs and cases, sold by wineries and wine brands through Amazon.

Despite trying to change regulations, Amazon couldn't keep acting as a middleman between the wineries and customers, for which they received a fee, and stay in accordance with many state laws. So, they decided to close down that part of the site and focus on other ways of selling alcohol.

Don't freak out yet, though. You can still place orders on Amazon Wine through December 31, and the company is still very much in the wine game by way of Prime Now (hour delivery for the win) and Amazon Fresh (their grocery delivery service), both of which get wine \u2013 and beer and liquor, in some places \u2013 to you faster than Amazon Wine could.

By Madison Flager Oct 25, 2017 When it comes to pumpkin , we thought we'd seen it all. Leave it to a restaurant with three Michelin stars to come up with an insane dessert that blows every other pumpkin iteration out of the water. Alinea , named the best restaurant in America three times over, is making waves on social media with its tiny clear pumpkin pie. First posted by Chef de Cuisine Simon Davies on Sept. 24, the diminuitive pumpkin pie makes you feel like you have x-ray vision.

This is made with a machine called a \"rotovap\" that creates a clear liquid with the flavor of whatever food you put into it. So while the pie looks like water (or Jell-o), it tastes like pumpkin. Chef and Alinea Owner Grant Achatz posted a picture of several plated mini pies this week, so it looks like the dessert is officially on Alinea's menu.

(So please stop accusing of us being pickle freaks, Facebook friends!) Most of the existing recipes are compound butters. Meaning, you mix a bunch of flavorful stuff into softened butter and refrigerate it's until hard and sliceable. It's something we love but never make because it's fussy. Our version is MUCH easier. Alexa Payesko Most Popular Pretty much the only thing you need to do is melt butter, which ANYONE can handle. Once that's done, you're just whisking in pickle juice, chopped pickles, dill, hot sauce, and some Old Bay seasoning (or chili powder). And voila. You've made the mother sauce of pickles! The butter is best while it's warm (and still dunkable). Don't think too hard about what to serve it with because it tastes good with almost anything. Burger, yes. Chicken, yes. Cornbread, heck yes.

Dutch Crunch Bread A post shared by High Functioning Foodie \uf369 (@thekaloriekut) on Sep 20, 2017 at 5:08pm PDT San Francisco's famous sourdough is great, but there's something to be said about a food so local, barely anyone outside the region knows of it. That's the case with Dutch Crunch, a bread that's smothered with rice flour and sugar before baking, so its top develops a crunchy, crackled coating.

So when we saw that the The New York Times wrote about one blogger's recipe, we dropped everything to try it \u2014 and so did just about everyone else on the planet. Pictures of the abnormally wrinkly, behemoth chocolate chip cookie are everywhere on Instagram.

The woman behind the craze is Sarah Kieffer, author of The Vanilla Bean Baking Book , and the secret to her raved-about cookies has nothing to do with baking time or ingredients.\"It's all in the pan-bang,\" she told The Times . Halfway through baking the cookies, when they're slightly puffed in the center, she asks you to drop the pan against the oven rack \u2014 not gently, but from about 4 inches up. The point is to have the center of each cookie to fall down. A couple minutes later, once the cookie puffs back up again, you bang it again \u2026 and again and again. Rian Handler Most Popular BUY NOW: The Vanilla Bean Baking Book, $19; amazon.com It's not the most calming process, but it can be pretty therapeutic if you're having a long, frustrating week. Others around you, however, might get a bit annoyed. One tester I know commented that her dad \"did not appreciate\" all the ruckus in the kitchen. But noise complaints aside, the technique really works. It creates tree trunk-esque rings in the cookie like we've never seen before. When we baked a batch (using the same recipe) without banging the pan, the cookies spread a lot more and were significantly crunchier. The banged cookies were far superior in texture. The inside was perfectly chewy, the exterior was slightly crisp and caramelized, and all those sunken rings of cookie were ever so slightly softer. Though pretty dang perfect in taste, this will likely not be our go-to recipe. It takes too much time! First, you need to freeze the dough for 15 minutes before baking. (If you don't, they'll spread like cray.) Then you can only bake one sheet at a time, since the cookies need to bake in the center of the oven. And on the baking sheets, you only get 4 to 6 cookies because they're so enormous. Julia Smith We will, however, save this recipe for a day when we have a lot of pent-up anger and have a few hours to kill (those days exist, right?). Or when we just need a really, really good cookie. RELATED VIDEO: Download the Delish app today. Follow Delish on Instagram .

Case Oct 30, 2017 Diet empire Weight Watchers is getting into the wine business \u2014 kind of. The company just announced a lower-calorie Sauvignon Blanc, called Cense, which has fewer points per glass than the typical vino. It may seem like a random brand extension, until you see the raw data. Wine is the second most-tracked beverage \u2014 coffee being first \u2014 according Ryan Nathan, Vice President of Products, Licensing, and Ecommerce at Weight Watchers . So, the company partnered with California producer Truett-Hurst Winery (which makes wines for retailers like Trader Joe's). The goal was to create a wine that clocked in at three points, rather than the typical four, says Nathan. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The trick turned out to be in an algorithm that kept sugar and calories low \u2014 so a 5-oz. glass contains just 85 calories, compared to the typical 120 \u2014 but it also lowered the alcohol level. Most wines are labeled between 9 and 15 percent, with Sauvignon Blancs coming in around 11-13.5. Cense is 9.6 percent alcohol by volume. Weight Watchers Most Popular Developing a lower-calorie wine while also ensuring the wine tasted good wasn't easy, says Phil Hurst, Co-Founder and President and CEO of Truett-Hurst Winery. The company initially imagined that if they started with a big, round red \u2014 like a Zinfandel or Syrah from California's Dry Creek \u2014 and reduced the alcohol, they'd still have a wine that was incredibly robust. They were wrong. In fact, it took the company two years to land on its ideal formula. Winemaker Ross Reedy posited that choosing a naturally aromatic wine that was crisp, high in acidity, zesty in flavor, and didn't need oak treatment \u2014 and then reducing the alcohol \u2014 would do the trick. So, they turned to Sauvignon Blanc. Grapes for Cense are sourced from a vineyard in Marlborough and made into wine there, then the wine is shipped to the U.S., where the alcohol is reduced and the wine is bottled. Sometimes when you put a lower alcohol wine in a lineup it can seem thin or wimpy in comparison to its higher alcohol brethren. Not so with the Cense. After sampling a bottle, we were surprised to find how much it tasted like a classic Sauvignon Blanc. The nose is heavy on the grapefruit \u2014 mostly ruby red grapefruit \u2014 plus a good bit of Meyer lemon, followed by a hint of candied pineapple. Those aromas carry through to the flavor, which is citrusy with a touch of green jalapeno-like notes. The Cense has screaming acidity, although not mouth-puckeringly so. As of today, you can buy a bottle at Censewines.com starting at $15, and at Kroger stores where it retails for $13.99. The two companies expect to launch a ros\u00e9 in the near future.

And everyone loves it baked \u2014 whether it's wrapped in puff pastry or slathered with fruit preserves. What most people are neglecting to do, however, is baking a whole wheel inside of a bread bowl. A bloomin' bread bowl. It's kinda like pull-apart bread, where each chunk you tear off is super garlicky and perfectly toasty. But in the middle is just a pool of glorious molten cheese. Alexa Payesko Most Popular To \"bloom\" the bread, all you need to do is slice off the top of a large boule then dig out a well. (Save those scooped out bread pieces for dunking later.) Carefully, cut down around the edges of the bread to create the slices that people will tear after baking, then load it up with cheese and bake it 'til you make it.

Bloomberg reports that Papa John's says the NFL's latest controversies are to blame for lower pizza sales. That's because some people are boycotting watching games while players kneel during the National Anthem, so that means fewer people see Papa John's ads and decide to order pizza.

But good or bad, leadership starts at the top, and this is an example of poor leadership.\" Most Popular To be fair, chain founder John Schnatter is an outspoken Republican and Trump supporter , so he may be making a political statement by blaming NFL protesters for the sales slump. But his claim may not be entirely unfounded. A Bloomberg analyst said if fewer Americans are watching football, fewer people are ordering their usual pepperoni pizzas to sit and watch the game.
