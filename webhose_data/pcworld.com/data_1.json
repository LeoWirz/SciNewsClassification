Sorry | Oct 3, 2017 9:57 AM PT Seagate Intel Coffee Lake Core i7-8700K reviewed, the fall PC gaming harvest is here!... \nTwo weeks ago, we spied a pretty decent deal for a $60 2TB WD external hard drive . If you don't need to travel with a storage drive, however, today's deal is even better. Best Buy is offering a Seagate 4TB desktop external hard drive for $70 \u2014that's about $30 cheaper than you'll find elsewhere. \nIt's not clear how long this deal will last, so if you're interested, buy one sooner rather than later. \nThe Seagate Backup Plus 4TB External USB 3.0 Hard Drive is a desktop external storage drive, which means it requires a permanent location and an AC adapter for power. It's also fairly sizable, weighing nearly two pounds and measuring 4.6 x 1.4 x 7.8 inches. [ Further reading: We tear apart a hard drive and SSD to show you how they work ] \nAs its name indicates, this external drive supports USB 3.0. It also has a USB 3.0 interface, requiring use of that special double-pronged cable often seen on external hard drives. Included with the drive is Seagate's Dashboard software to make backups and access to your files easier. The program allows you to save content from your online accounts and mobile devices, too. \nAccording to the listing, the drive is compatible with both Windows PCs (Windows 7 and later) and Macs running OSX 10.9 or later, so presumably it's plug and play right out of the box. Even if it's not, the price makes the minor inconvenience of formatting the drive far less annoying.

Sorry | Oct 4, 2017 11:10 AM PT Google Google Pixelbook first impressions \nGoogle\u2019s Daydream View is only a year old, but it\u2019s already receiving a minor refresh to make one of the best mobile VR headsets even better as Google invests in virtual tourism. \nThe tweaks on the hardware side are minor, but welcome. Most notably, the new Daydream View includes updated high-performance lenses that promise better visual quality and a wider field of view\u2014though Google didn\u2019t delve into hard numbers. The original model had a ho-hum 90 degree FOV. As far the visuals go, it makes sense for Google to stay vague there, as the Daydream View requires a Daydream VR-enabled smartphone like the new Pixel 2 to act as its brains and screen, and display quality varies from device to device. \nThe original Daydream View was already one of the most comfortable mobile VR headsets around, and Google says the two-tone fabric in the updated version makes it even lighter and softer. Google \nBut as ever, hardware is only as useful as the software that runs on it. The first Daydream View launched with 25 virtual reality apps, and a year later, that number is up to over 250. Google says that mobile VR users lean heavily towards virtual tourism, not just games, and to that end it\u2019s bringing a lot more travel and entertainment apps to Daydream VR. Here\u2019s what Google VR VP Clay Bavor had to say in the new Daydream View\u2019s announcement post : \n\u201cGet closer than front row seats with intimate performances from your favorite stars like Ed Sheeran in \u201cAustin City Limits Backstage.\u201d Hear personal confessions from huge comics like Trevor Noah in \u201cThe Confessional,\u201d a YouTube VR original from Felix & Paul. With \u201cFemale Planet,\u201d follow in the footsteps of inspiring women like Gina Rodriguez and Inna Braverman. Venture to all seven continents with the new series Discovery \u201cTRVLR,\u201d and blast off into space with IMAX 3D in Google Play Movies.\u201d \nWith Samsung\u2019s Gear VR still going strong, Apple tip-toeing into augmented reality , and Oculus experimenting with standalone headsets , the battle for mobile VR sure is heating up. The revamped Daydream View will come in fog, charcoal, and coral colors and retail for $99 when it launches at an unspecified time later this year.

It\u2019s still a good deal bigger than the 5.8-inch iPhone X and only slightly smaller than the 6.3-inch Note 8: Pixel 2 XL: 157.9 x 76.7 x 7.9 mm Note 8: 162.5 x 74.8 x 8.6 mm iPhone X: 138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3 mm Pixel 2 XL vs. Note 8 vs. iPhone X: Display Google \nThe Pixel 2 XL's display is a full half-inch bigger than lst year's model. \nFor the first time, all three phones feature AMOLED screens (Apple has long used LCDs in its iPhones), but that doesn't tell the whole story. The Note 8's Infinity Display is the only one with a true edge-to-edge screen. Apple's iPhone X stretches the limits by completely eliminating the top and bottom bezels on the iPhone X, even going so far as to design a notch in the center of the screen for the camera. The Pixel 2 XL is relatively pedestrian by comparison. All three displays feature rounded edges, and each differs a little in size: Pixel 2 XL: 6-inch, 2880 x 1440 P-OLED, HDR, 538ppi Note 8: 6.3-inch, 2960 x 1440 Super AMOLED, HDR, 532ppi iPhone X : 5.8-inch, 2436 x 1125 Super AMOLED, HDR, 458ppi Pixel 2 XL vs. Note 8 vs. iPhone X: Performance Apple \nThe iPhone X features Apple's own A11 Bionic chip. \nUnlike last year, when Google debuted a new chip in its first Pixel phones, the Pixel 2 XL uses the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor as the Galaxy Note 8. The iPhone X, on the other hand, uses Apple's homegrown A11 Bionic chip, which has blown away benchmark scores. \nBut while the iPhone X is a good deal faster on paper, in real-world tests, all three phones should perform about the same. The Pixel 2 XL will likely have a long-term advantage over the Note 8 due to Android optimizations and steady updates, and the same is true for the iPhone X and Apple's regular iOS care. Pixel 2 XL vs. Note 8 vs. iPhone X: Storage Google \nThe Pixel 2 XL comes in 64 GB or 128 GB flavors. \nAll three phones start at 64GB of storage, but you can get a 128GB Pixel 2 XL and a 256GB iPhone X, both of which should provide plenty of space for apps, movies, and photos. While the Note 8 is available only in a 64GB version, it does have an SD Card slot for expanding storage up to 256GB. Neither the Pixel 2 XL nor the iPhone X offer expandable storage. Pixel 2 XL: 64GB or 128GB Note 8: 64GB, SD Card support up to 256GB iPhone X: 64GB or 128GB Pixel 2 XL vs. Note 8 vs. iPhone X: Water resistance Apple \nAny of these phones can get really, really wet. \nEach phone offers some level of water resistance, but the Note 8 wins this round: Pixel 2 XL: IP67 (submersion of 1 meter for 30 minutes) Note 8: IP68 (submersion of 1.5 meters for 30 minutes) iPhone X: IP67 (submersion of 1 meter for 30 minutes) Pixel 2 XL vs. Note 8 vs. iPhone X: Battery Apple \nThe iPhone X features wireless charging, but the Pixel 2 XL doesn't. \nAll three phones have big batteries and either of them should easily get you through a full day of use: Pixel 2 XL: 3,250mAh Note 8: 3,300mAh iPhone X: At least 2,675mAh \nThe Pixel 2 XL sports a 3,250mAh battery, which is on par with most of its Android peers. Plus, Google promises that the Pixel 2 will get 7 hours of battery life from a 15-minute charge. The Note 8's is slightly larger with a 3,300mAh battery, and our testing showed it lasted about 10 hours. \nWe won't know for sure how big the iPhone X's battery is until iFixit gets its hands on one and tears it apart, but Apple has said it will last \"up to two hours longer\" longer than the iPhone 8 Plus, which has a 2,675mAh battery. So, presumably the iPhone X will have a 3,000+mAh battery like the Note 8 and Pixel 2 XL, but it's hard to say since Apple's iOS optimizations do much of the heavy lifting and OLED is generally more power efficient then LCDs. \nHowever, the Pixel 2 XL does not support wireless charging, something that is available on the Note 8 and the iPhone X. Pixel 2 XL vs. Note 8 vs. iPhone X: Camera Adam Patrick Murray/IDG \nThe Note 8 has one of the best smartphone cameras... but the Pixel 2 XL's might be better. \nHere's where things get interesting. All three of these phones feature awesome cameras, but DxO says the Pixel 2 XL has the best camera they've ever tested, achieving a near-perfect score of 98. For comparison, the Note 8 and iPhone 8 Plus both got 94s, the previous highest score. \nOf course, cameras are subjective, so we won't know how they compare until we can test the Pixel 2 XL and iPhone X thoroughly. But DxO had this to say about the Pixel 2 camera: \"We\u2019re in danger of running out of superlatives when describing the major image quality attributes of the Google Pixel 2.\" \nHere's how the three phones match up on paper: Pixel 2 XL: 12.2MP with laser autofocus and dual pixel phase detection, f/1.8, optical image stabilization Note 8: Dual 12MP wide-angle and telephoto cameras, f/1.7 and f/2.4, dual optical image stabilization, 2X optical zoom iPhone X: Dual 12MP wide-angle and telephoto cameras, f/1.8 and f/2.4, dual optical image stabilization, 2X optical zoom \nNotably, the Pixel 2 XL doesn't have a dual-camera system. However, it uses its processing smarts to mimic the portrait modes on the Note 8 and iPhone X, so you'll still be able to take photos with blurred backgrounds. And like the iPhone X, it works on both the front and rear cameras. Again, we'll need to test it before we judge, but it's impressive that Google can accomplish a dual-camera trick with a single camera. \nOn the video side, the Pixel 2 XL film 4K in 30fps, while iPhone X films at 60fps. The Note 8 also tops out at 30fps, though Samsung says a 60fps update is coming soon. Additionally the Pixel 2 XL and iPhone X both have slo-mo video support for 1080p at 240fps, while the Note 8 only supports 720p. Pixel 2 XL vs. Note 8 vs. iPhone X: Special features \nThe Pixel 2 XL has squeezable sides so you can launch Google Assistant. \nEach of these phones has something about it that sets it apart from the other: Pixel 2 XL: Active Edge, squeeze to launch Google Assistant Note 8: S-Pen for taking note, drawing iPhone X: Face ID for unlocking and Animoji \nThe Pixel 2 XL's defining feature is actually borrowed from the HTC U11 . Originally called Edge Sense, it lets you physically squeeze the sides of the the phone to launch apps and actions. On the Pixel 2 XL it's tied to Google Assistant, giving users one more way to summon the digital helper. Whether it's more useful than the Note 8's S Pen or Face ID on the iPhone X will depend on the user, but it's pretty gimmicky. Pixel 2 XL vs. Note 8 vs. iPhone X: Price Google \nAll that screen comes at a price. \nNeither of these phones are cheap, but the Pixel 2 XL comes in a bit less than the Note 8. The iPhone X is the only one among the three that tops $1,000. Pixel 2 XL: $849 ($64GB), $949 ($128GB) Note 8: $930 (64GB) iPhone X: $999 (64GB), $1,149 (256GB) Pixel 2 XL vs. Note 8 vs. iPhone X: Availability Doug Duvall/IDG \nYou can but the Note 8 anywhere, but the Pixel 2 XL is still a Verizon exclusive. \nThis is a big difference. You can walk into any carrier and buy a Note 8 or an iPhone X (once it's available), but the Pixel 2 XL is still exclusive to Verizon stores. Unlocked phones will be sold through Google.com and can be used with any carrier, but last year's Pixel was stubbornly out of stock for months. So we'll need to see whether Google can keep up with demand this time around. To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

It doesn\u2019t have a stunning liquid metal exterior.\nBut once you hold the Pixel 2 XL in your hand, and begin playing with the features that Google has tuned with machine learning and clever interface design, you begin to appreciate the elegant marriage of hardware and software that Google is bringing to the entire \u201cMade By Google\u201d family.\nSure, it\u2019s still a super-spendy phone at $849. And as a happy Pixel XL user, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d throw down so much money for an upgrade after only one year.

It was a halo device that illustrated what a Chromebook could be\u2014in a broad, sweeping romantic sense\u2014if designed with complete disregard for consumer pricing sensitivity.\nIndeed, would anyone spend almost $1,500 on a computer that can\u2019t even run Windows applications? The world generally scoffed\u2014and then scoffed again when Google updated the Pixel in 2015.\nBut now we have the Google Pixelbook, which starts at $999 for a Core i5/8GB RAM/128GB SSD config, and goes up to $1,649 for a Core i7/16GB RAM/512GB SSD config.

And if you follow the money\u2014which in this case, comes mostly from Microsoft\u2019s enterprise businesses\u2014that\u2019s most likely the real reason why no Microsoft consumer service can feel completely safe. \nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T13:05:20.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c7cfa4e3a306f780e7b575bf239af54f50082d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIwp2ST2wh4wDfrz9ZbcIJ3aaidHzuF5HK7taYmIUbnIvnkJrWNqU0JbZsYji51lfrvxJePgO4izIZxArJXJqBwJ__hSp9_7euVDxf7cSeZq945WAg6oz2", "site_full": "www.pcworld.com", "site": "pcworld.com", "site_section": "http://www.pcworld.com/category/desktop-computers/index.rss", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "PCWorld PCs", "title": "HP Omen 17 (2017) review: You get a lot of gaming laptop for the money", "title_full": "HP Omen 17 (2017) review: You get a lot of gaming laptop for the money", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 170, "comments": 0, "shares": 170}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c7cfa4e3a306f780e7b575bf239af54f50082d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIwp2ST2wh4wDfrz9ZbcIJ3aaidHzuF5HK7taYmIUbnIvnkJrWNqU0JbZsYji51lfrvxJePgO4izIZxArJXJqBwJ__hSp9_7euVDxf7cSeZq945WAg6oz2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "pcworld.com", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "HP Omen 17 (2017) review: You get a lot of gaming laptop for the money", "text": "When we reviewed HP\u2019s 17-inch Omen gaming laptop last year , we found it to be a little boring, but packed with a ton of powerful hardware at a very attractive price.

The Star Wars Battlefront II beta\u2019s been available for a few days to people who preordered, but today it went live to everyone. Well, everyone who has Origin installed, that is. \nThe beta ends on Monday at 9 a.m. Pacific, and you can find more details here . Binary sunset \nOkay, enough talk about 2017\u2019s Star Wars Battlefront II . Let\u2019s talk 2005\u2019s instead. That\u2019s right, the 2005 Battlefront II is in the news this week, as Disney collaborated with GOG.com to patch official multiplayer support back into the game\u2014a feature that\u2019s been broken since the collapse of GameSpy in 2014. From the announcement : \n\u201cPowered by GOG Galaxy, the multiplayer function of the game has now been restored AND with added Crossplay support between GOG Galaxy and Steam to boot. This long-awaited feature finally brings the entire Star Wars Battlefront II community together, no matter which part of the galaxy you come from, so go ahead and jump into the fray.\u201d \nSeems like GOG Galaxy is required to be installed, and the unofficial support for GameRanger was broken in the process\u2014both probably a bit of a shame to some percentage of the audience. Still, it's a pretty cool move and maybe a signal that attitudes towards game preservation are changing? Maybe. Hit the road \nAnother Kickstarter/Early Access title finally emerges into the realms of \u201cFinished Games\u201d this week, as Road Rash spiritual successor Road Redemption rides into a 1.0 release. To give you an idea: It was Kickstarted way back in 2013 and has been in Early Access since 2014, so congrats on them making it out. Here\u2019s a release trailer four years in the making: Triple fine \nOf course the crowdfunded game I\u2019m really waiting for is Psychonauts 2 . That one didn\u2019t hit a 1.0 release this week unfortunately, but we did get our first real look at a playable chunk of the game, courtesy of this cleverly named \u201cFirst Playable\u201d video clip\u2014almost 15 minutes of footage, though the playable stuff is interspersed with a bunch of developer interviews too. You\u2019ll also get a decent view of a goat\u2019s butt. Nioh-rly exclusive \nEarlier this year the PS4 nabbed an exclusive in the form of Team Ninja\u2019s Souls -like Samurai game Nioh . Turns out that was more of a \u201ctimed exclusive\u201d than an \u201cexclusive exclusive,\u201d as Team Ninja revealed this week the game is coming to PC\u2014and soon, too. November 7 is the date Nioh: Complete Edition will hit Steam, with all three DLC chunks packed in for free, plus 4K graphics and the usual bells and whistles. Know when to hold \u2018em \nAlso coming on November 7: Deck-based RPG Hand of Fate 2 . And deck-based RPG makes it sound like some sort of Hearthstone knockoff\u2014I should know, because that\u2019s what I thought the original was for a long time. It\u2019s not at all though, with combat more like your usual Arkham Asylum -style action game and each battle modified by cards you draw. I don\u2019t know, hard to explain, and this trailer doesn\u2019t do the concept much justice either, but I highly recommend checking out the original .

Sorry | Oct 9, 2017 11:33 AM PT Google \nIf you live near a Meijer, you can grab a great deal on a Chromecast Ultra today. The grocery chain is selling Google's streaming device for nearly 50 percent off \u2014or $35 instead of the usual $69. \nMeijer stores are in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin. \nThis is Google's 4K-friendly Chromecast that rolled out late last year, but it works with all TVs. However, keep in mind that if you have an older 4K TV, the higher resolution options may not work. Your TV must support HDCP 2.2 for 4K streaming. [ Further reading: The best home water leak detectors ] \nWhen we reviewed the Chromecast Ultra nearly a year ago , we liked it for improvements like an Ethernet jack in the power adapter, overall speed improvements, and of course the aforementioned support for 4K and 4K HDR. \nThe price was also attractive. Even though it's typically double the price of earlier Chromecast devices, it's still cheaper than many competing 4K streamers. One similarly priced device is the recently announced Amazon Fire TV refresh with 4K support. \nSince it's unclear when this deal will expire, we recommend heading to your local store sooner rather than later.

TLC drives are available in larger capacities (up to 2TB), but are marginally cheaper than MLC drives at best. \nBut the biggest issue has been speed. When TLC drives were first introduced, sustained write performance on some was slower than a hard drive\u2019s, and not a particularly fast hard drive. Thankfully, advanced caching and tiering with faster SLC and MLC (actually TLC treated as that) has largely remedied that.\nSadly, the cure hasn\u2019t benefited Toshiba\u2019s new TR200. Not since the Toshiba/OCZ Trion 100 have we seen a drive this slow with large data sets, writing them slower than most hard drives.

Oreo finally makes video playback more friendly with the addition of picture-in-picture (PiP) mode on phones and tablets. The only issue is knowing when and how to use this feature.\nHow to launch picture-in-picture mode To launch picture-in-picture mode, just tap the home button. Okay, that sounds easy, but there's more to it. You need to be watching a video or other live content that is enabled for PiP. Additionally, the app needs to have support for the new API in Oreo. We're still in the early days, so it's mostly Google apps that work with PiP. YouTube will work, but only if you have YouTube Red. Maps will use PiP for navigation if you tap the home button. Chrome, Play Movies, and Duo all do PiP for videos.
