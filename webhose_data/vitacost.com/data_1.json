But what about your pets? You probably wouldn\u2019t be surprised to learn pets need exercise just like we do. If they don\u2019t get enough physical activity, it can lead to serious health issues, just like it can in humans. But when our own schedules get busy, we often find ourselves shortening our dog\u2019s walks or cutting out playtime with other pets. However, exercising your pet should remain a priority despite a busy to-do list. \nPlus, your pet\u2019s playtime can act as a great source of physical activity for you, too! Whether it\u2019s jogging three miles with your dog or teasing your cat with a mouse on a string, these activities will get your heart pumping as well as your pets. So, how much exercise do your pets need? \nGuidelines vary depending on the type and age of pet that you have, but there are some basic recommendations to help you stay on track. In general, dogs need thirty minutes to two hours of physical activity daily. Certain breeds, such as hunting dogs, will need closer to two hours with thirty of those minutes devoted to vigorous activity. Cats require less active time due to their naturally high metabolisms, so fifteen to thirty minutes a day is sufficient. \nIf your pet is not currently physically active, work on gradually easing them into exercising. Just like humans, it is possible to over-train your pet, which could lead to injury, exhaustion or extreme weight loss. For the most part, it should be easy to monitor your pet and determine the right stopping time. Younger pets are also much more resilient than older pets, so if you have a senior, keep their activity at a moderate intensity and for shorter durations. \nAdding a glucosamine supplement into your pet\u2019s diet can also help support their joint health. What kind of activities should you do with your pets? \nYou can help your pets get active every day in a bunch of different ways! \nTake a walk The simplest way to get active is to go on fast-paced walks or jogs, depending on their fitness level. Be on the lookout for local trails and greenways to keep it exciting. \nThrow a ball If you\u2019ve already gotten your workout in for the day, playing fetch can be a great way to exhaust your dog without exhausting yourself! This latex ball is durable and will last for years of playing fetch. \nGo for a swim Live by the beach, lake or have a pool? See if your dog is a swimmer! You may just discover your he enjoys swimming way more than you thought he would. \nMake them chase If you are a cat owner, then grab a flashlight and watch your cat chase the light around the room. You\u2019ll be amazed at how long this keeps their attention. Or pick up this fun interactive wire toy ! \nLet them scratch To keep your cat active while you are out, buy (or build!) your own cat scratching post that will help build muscle while he climbs, as well as keep his nails in check. \nHowever you decide to help your pet stay active, make sure that they are getting the recommended amount of activity every day to keep them healthy and strong!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:39:55.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ec61930f255509e84b0f1c2e1c9ce97b8f32a7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wiWKvqT0fAK_ku1GGVngU7cUZh7Lvo6Xv8Wbv_UEUHgDl3A4JPKkMnvugGWUTJ9adIvsjR0TXWsMc5yI1cJZKtJEu4vGqd6k6ASf2e52Gu8s-", "site_full": "www.vitacost.com", "site": "vitacost.com", "site_section": "http://blog.vitacost.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "VitaVibes Blog | Vitacost.com", "title": "4 Must-Have Skin Care Products for Busy Moms", "title_full": "4 Must-Have Skin Care Products for Busy Moms", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3482, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0ec61930f255509e84b0f1c2e1c9ce97b8f32a7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wiWKvqT0fAK_ku1GGVngU7cUZh7Lvo6Xv8Wbv_UEUHgDl3A4JPKkMnvugGWUTJ9adIvsjR0TXWsMc5yI1cJZKtJEu4vGqd6k6ASf2e52Gu8s-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Bombshell Mommy", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "4 Must-Have Skin Care Products for Busy Moms", "text": "The Bombshell Mommy October 3, 2017 0 Beauty Tips \nMom life is a busy life. Even when you don\u2019t want it to be and you\u2019ve totally committed to the whole idea of not being busy , it doesn\u2019t matter because you still have to go to work, pack lunches, drop kids off and pick them up, help with school projects, take the kids to extracurricular activities and play dates, and on and on. Basically, busyness is unavoidable even with the best of intentions. \nOf course, what goes by the wayside when your schedule is overbooked \u2013 is you. While you may have mastered keeping protein bars and a piece of fresh fruit in your bag, and filling not one but two water bottles for the day, taking care of your skin definitely has a tendency to fall to the bottom of the list. \nInstead of letting your complexion suffer, keep these skin care products with you to help your skin stay healthy and cared for when you\u2019re constantly on the go. 1. Blotting paper \nWhile you might be tempted to reapply foundation or powder multiple times throughout the day, that\u2019s just asking for a major breakout. You\u2019re not only burdening your skin with layers of pore-clogging cosmetics but you\u2019re introducing oil and bacteria to your brushes, beauty blenders and sponges. \nBlotting paper is specifically designed to absorb oil while refreshing your foundation. They are compact, lightweight and can be stashed in your bag or glove compartment, or both. 2. Sunblock \nFor many women, sunblock has become a standard part of their morning skin care routine . But for most, it begins and ends at a quick application to their face and then they think they\u2019re good and covered. In actuality, your neck, chest, hands and arms (and legs if you\u2019re wearing shorts or a skirt) need to be protected from harmful UV rays if you\u2019re going to be outside more than 20 minutes at a time. \nKeep a travel-size bottle of SPF 30 or higher sunscreen in your purse, gym bag and especially your car. Though we don\u2019t often think about it, a great amount of our sun exposure comes from time in our car. Keep it near by and don\u2019t forget to reapply! 3. Moisturizer \nDuring the colder, drier months of the year, your skin really suffers. All of the artificial heated air pumped into our homes, cars and workplaces decreases the humidity indoors and sucks the moisture right out of your skin. By keeping a lightweight moisturizer on hand (pun entirely intended), the harsh effects of dry winter air can be combated and your skin will stay healthy and supple. 4. Hydrating mist \nAnother way to withstand the damage of a dry environment and to keep your skin healthy is to use a hydrating mist . Great for refreshing your body and mind, hydrating mists can be made with a variety of ingredients such as sea water, coconut water, rose water. They often contain a combination of soothing, rejuvenating and hydrating ingredients such as ylang ylang, aloe vera and grape seed oil to nourish and hydrate your skin. \nA perfect addition to your skin care routine, apply a light mist before applying your makeup in the morning, after washing your face at night, and also throughout the day to prevent dryness.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T12:25:11.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "054b2b1573f550ea85ad2d687c08f4b26fc02e8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wix7rQ0XTXzbzMa5MhQgd0D0iHEI8VgRVAv.02WJ4_30v3JJ.qSSBS6BXouMyPzfXwFkCl32L2eg-", "site_full": "www.vitacost.com", "site": "vitacost.com", "site_section": "http://blog.vitacost.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "VitaVibes Blog | Vitacost.com", "title": "DIY Garbage Pail Pods with Lavender Tea Tree & Tangerine Essential Oils", "title_full": "DIY Garbage Pail Pods with Lavender Tea Tree & Tangerine Essential Oils", "published": "2017-10-04T23:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3482, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "054b2b1573f550ea85ad2d687c08f4b26fc02e8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wix7rQ0XTXzbzMa5MhQgd0D0iHEI8VgRVAv.02WJ4_30v3JJ.qSSBS6BXouMyPzfXwFkCl32L2eg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aura Cacia", "published": "2017-10-04T23:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "DIY Garbage Pail Pods with Lavender Tea Tree & Tangerine Essential Oils", "text": "Aura Cacia October 4, 2017 0 Home & Family \nLending their purifying and citrusy aromas to this recipe, lavender tea tree and tangerine essential oils are the two star ingredients in these must-make pods. \nIf you\u2019re not already familiar with lavender tea tree, it\u2019s a single essential oil from the Melaleuca ericifolia plant.

Rather, the tiny (as in 5\u20192\u201d) New York native is dominating the news due to her public struggle with fibromyalgia . \nTo some, the medical disorder is well-understood, perhaps affecting themselves or someone they know\u2014after all, the condition impacts approximately 10 million Americans. To others, however, fibromyalgia is as elusive as Bitcoin\u2014seen in the news but incomprehensible. With that in mind, here\u2019s what you should know about the disorder, what you should look out for in yourself, and how it can be relieved naturally: What is fibromyalgia\u2014and what are its symptoms? \nFibromyalgia first entered the medical lexicon in 1990 to describe the chronic pain condition riddling myriad Americans. Characterized by persistent pain that\u2019s felt from head to toe and is accompanied by symptoms that range from fatigue and headaches to intestinal distress and insomnia, fibromyalgia is often associated with mood and memory problems and a hypersensitivity to pain. \n\u201cPain\u201d itself might sound vague, but as the Mayo Clinic puts it, the widespread \u201cpain associated with fibromyalgia often is described as a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months.\u201d As for designating it \u201cwidespread,\u201d \u201cthe pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your waist.\u201d \nAnd it\u2019s not just that perpetual discomfort that disturbs fibromyalgia sufferers. \n\u201cPeople with fibromyalgia often awaken tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time,\u201d the Mayo Clinic says. \u201cSleep is often disrupted by pain, and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea.\u201d \nWithin this, cognitive complications arise, most notably brain fog (or \u201cfibro fog\u201d), which impairs one\u2019s ability to concentrate. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re having dementia,\u201d the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Dr. Arya Mohabbat told Billboard , \u201cbut they\u2019re having a lot of issues with short term memory and task related memory recall activities, like, \u2018I pick up my phone but who was I going to call?\u2019 type of thing, which can be extremely frustrating.\u201d \nThe aforementioned tummy troubles and hypersensitivity cannot be overstated. Take it from the award-winning author of Seabiscuit and Unbroken Laura Hillenbrand, who wrote of the disorder that forced her to drop out of college: \u201c\u2026everything I ate made my abdomen balloon. I radiated heat, and my joints and muscles felt bruised. Every day on the way to classes, I struggled a little harder to make it up the hill behind my apartment. Eventually, I began stopping halfway to rest against the trunk of a tree.\u201d \nSound familiar? Read on. Who does it affect? \nAs with most medical disorders, fibromyalgia impacts a wide swath of people. That said, nearly 90 percent of those afflicted are women\u2014and most are Caucasian. What\u2019s more, there appears to be a familial pattern to the condition: A twin has a 50 percent greater chance of having fibromyalgia if their \u201cclone\u201d has it as well, while a child is 8.5 times more likely to have the disorder if one of their parents is affected with it. Other disorders also play a role. Those who have osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, for example, may have a higher risk of developing fibromyalgia. How is it caused\u2014and how is it diagnosed? \nWhile genetics play a role, so does one\u2019s, well, life . Certain events\u2014physical trauma, surgery, infection or major psychological stress\u2014can precipitate fibromyalgia. In other cases, though, \u201csymptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event,\u201d the Mayo Clinic reports. In order to be diagnosed with fibromyalgia, one must have pain in 11 of 18 trigger points around the body, as well as the presence of other symptoms (including \u201cfatigue, waking up tired and trouble thinking,\u201d WebMD says). What are its complications? \nPersistent pain, a tough time sleeping, bladder irritation\u2014these and other symptoms are just half the battle for those with fibromyalgia. Depression is a common side effect (30 precent of fibromyalgia sufferers have it), as well as anxiety\u2014and utter frustration. \n\u201cOften one of the toughest things to deal with is the lack of understanding,\u201d Friday Magazine reports. \u201c\u2018With chronic fatigue-type conditions, sometimes other people will say, \u2018Oh, well I feel tired sometimes too, you just have to get on with it,\u2019\u201d Dr. Kim Lawson of Sheffield Hallam University\u2019s Department of Biosciences, Biomedical Research Center told the magazine. \u201c\u2018They don\u2019t appreciate the severity of it.\u2019\u201d \nIn response, many people afflicted with fibromyalgia end up giving up their jobs, their hobbies, even their whole way of life. How can it be helped, naturally? \nTake a glance at reports of Lady Gaga\u2019s illness (or her Netflix documentary on chronic pain ) and you\u2019ll find that the woman responsible for turning \u201cPoker Face\u201d into a classic has tried a litany of treatments, from medications (the FDA has approved three drugs to treat fibromyalgia) to alternative therapies. Over-the-counter medications\u2014such as Ibuprofen\u2014are also widely used, as well as muscle relaxers and opioid painkillers. \nBut what if you wanted to treat fibromyalgia naturally? \nFirst, consider the old adage that food is medicine. Antioxidant-rich foods\u2014fruits, vegetables and herbs\u2014naturally support sleep, mood and memory, while foods rich in omega-3s (think: salmon, flaxseed and walnuts) may organically alleviate joint and tendon tenderness and the morning stiffness fibro-sufferers often wake with. Grass-fed beef, when eaten in small amounts, may also help those with fibromyalgia: \u201cIt is an excellent source of iron and vitamin B12, both nutrients which are extremely important in keeping your pain-processing nervous system healthy,\u201d says the lead author of Potential Dietary Links in Central Sensitization in Fibromyalgia , Dr. Kathleen Holton. Meanwhile? Avoid additives like MSG and aspartame (which may \u201cactivate neurons that increase sensitivity to pain,\u201d Prevention reports) and curb your cappuccino consumption: Caffeine is notorious for interrupting a good night\u2019s sleep, which is central to minimizing fibromyalgia\u2019s symptoms. \nIn addition, take a look at vitamins and supplements and how they might support you in combating symptoms. Among those you should consider taking? Vitamin D and SAM-e (a substance naturally found in the body\u2014may help with pain by supporting a healthy mood). \u2020 \nFurther, don\u2019t forget how you may (or may not be) coping with stress \u2014an enormous factor in the severity of symptoms. Therapy, massage, acupuncture\u2014all can help you discover some respite from the condition. And while the presence of pain may prevent you from even thinking about exercise, it\u2019s one of the best ways to find relief from discomfort , stress and fatigue\u2014 and improve your outlook on life.

These days it seems like everyone is going, well nuts, for the tropical treat. \nChances are you\u2019ve tried coconut oil. You\u2019ve also probably helped yourself to a refreshing glass of coconut water \u2014and a generous slice of coconut cream pie . But you can\u2019t claim to be crazy for coconut unless you cross these 10 exciting products off your tropical to-try list. 1. Coconut flour \nRich in protein, fiber and healthy fats, coconut flour is a delicious, nutritious, gluten-free alternative to grain flour. Made from dried, ground coconut \u201cmeat,\u201d this flour works well in both sweet and savory recipes. Try it in breads, cookies, muffins and other baked goods, or use to thicken gravy, soups and stews, bind meatloaf and form faux pizza crust. 2. Coconut sugar \nSearching for a healthy sugar substitute? Consider adding coconut sugar to your diet regimen. Packed with essential vitamins and minerals, like potassium, magnesium and several B vitamins, coconut sugar boasts a lower glycemic index than agave, honey and cane sugar, and is a great addition to your favorite dessert recipes .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T00:00:38.315+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c10be39a0824ea6acec04fa67f4142c68e76e4b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wS6ciD5uZYZ1sV8GWxp61K7jc3GbF8PeWlkhLnwIJzxfcpJSR76kOWEb6KaQIlk.BVpSkkUyBs4aUHAu5c53dy.XMqe4A2r3nSHvGvxvX7.E-", "site_full": "www.vitacost.com", "site": "vitacost.com", "site_section": "http://blog.vitacost.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "VitaVibes Blog | Vitacost.com", "title": "Butternut Squash Fritters with Truffle Sea Salt", "title_full": "Butternut Squash Fritters with Truffle Sea Salt", "published": "2017-10-05T23:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3482, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c10be39a0824ea6acec04fa67f4142c68e76e4b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wS6ciD5uZYZ1sV8GWxp61K7jc3GbF8PeWlkhLnwIJzxfcpJSR76kOWEb6KaQIlk.BVpSkkUyBs4aUHAu5c53dy.XMqe4A2r3nSHvGvxvX7.E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gustus Vitae", "published": "2017-10-05T23:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Butternut Squash Fritters with Truffle Sea Salt", "text": "Gustus Vitae October 5, 2017 0 Appetizers \nFritters are far down a foodie\u2019s list of favorites.

But should they be on your child\u2019s day-to-day menu? Like scrambled eggs or a milkshake, opinions are mixed. \nTwo recent studies support the idea that kids benefit from drinking cow\u2019s milk and eating eggs, but a registered dietitian who works with parents and their kids says a diet free of cow\u2019s milk and eggs can be nutritionally sufficient. \nA study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that children who drink milk that doesn\u2019t come from cows are shorter than children who drink milk that does come from cows. Another study, this one appearing in the journal Pediatrics, showed eggs significantly improve the growth of young children.In the milk study, researchers looked at 5,034 children from ages 2 to 4. Of those studied, 92 percent drank cow\u2019s milk every daily and 13 percent drank non-cow\u2019s milk . \nFor each cup of non-cow\u2019s milk they drank daily, children were almost 0.16 inches shorter than average for their age, according to the study, while children were nearly 0.08 inches taller than average for each cup of cow\u2019s milk they drank daily. \nThe study didn\u2019t pinpoint why children who drank non-cow\u2019s milk were shorter on average than those who drank cow\u2019s milk. But the study\u2019s authors theorize that kids who drink non-cow\u2019s milk might consume less dietary protein and fat than those who drink cow\u2019s milk. \n\u201cThe nutritional content of cow\u2019s milk is regulated in the United States and Canada, while the nutritional contents of most non-cow\u2019s milks are not,\u201d Dr. Jonathon Maguire, the study\u2019s lead author and a pediatrician at St. Michael\u2019s Hospital in Toronto, says in a news release . \u201cThe lack of regulation means the nutritional content varies widely from one non-cow\u2019s milk product to the next, particularly in the amount of protein and fat.\u201d \nMaguire points out that two cups of cow\u2019s milk contain 16 grams of protein, representing 100 percent of the daily protein required for a 3-year-old. By contrast, two cups of almond milk typically contain 4 grams of protein, accounting for just 25 percent of the daily protein required for a 3-year-old. \nThe American Academy of Pediatrics doesn\u2019t recommend cow\u2019s milk, goat\u2019s milk or soy milk for a child during the first year of life. The academy says that once they\u2019re 1 year old, children should consume two to three servings of milk or milk products per day, with serving sizes fluctuating according to age. \nThe egg study looked at more than 160 children age 6 to 9 months in Ecuador. In 2015, a random group of infants was fed one egg a day for six months, and the other group didn\u2019t eat any eggs. Kids who consumed eggs showed a decreased incidence of stunted growth and low bodyweight, the study found. \nLora Iannotti, lead author of the study and an associate professor at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in child nutrition, says eggs are \u201ca good source of nutrients for growth and development in young children.\u201d \nThe Cleveland Clinic agrees. It says eggs \u201care an economical and healthy source of protein for your growing child,\u201d but it does note that egg yolks contain a considerable amount of dietary cholesterol. As such, your child can safely eat only one whole egg a day, the Cleveland Clinic says. \nRegistered dietitian Adina Pearson, who runs HealthyLittleEaters.com , acknowledges cow\u2019s milk and eggs are rich sources of protein, fat and other nutrients for children. \u201cSo in that sense, they are wonderfully nutritious and positively contribute to a child\u2019s food intake,\u201d she says. \nBut many kids don\u2019t drink cow\u2019s milk or eat eggs because they\u2019re allergic, their family follows a plant-based vegan diet or they just don\u2019t like either kind of food, Pearson says. \n\u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that such kids are at big risk for malnutrition in an otherwise balanced diet,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t recommend limiting a child\u2019s diet or taking away milk and eggs, if your child can\u2019t or won\u2019t eat these foods, then there are many other foods that can fill in the blanks.\u201d \nAs an alternative to cow\u2019s milk, Pearson recommends calcium-fortified soy milk or pea milk, rather than almond or rice milk, which tend to be too low in calories and fat. However, she adds, healthy fats can be found in foods like avocados, nut butters and olive oil. \nAs for protein, good substitutes for cow\u2019s milk or eggs are beans, lentils, tofu or meat, she says. \n\u201cThe key to supporting children in getting adequate nutrition is to serve and enjoy a wide variety of foods,\u201d Pearson says, \u201cand eat together as a family as often as possible.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john egan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jonathon maguire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maguire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adina pearson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pearson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lora iannotti", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nutrition  milk", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "st. michael\u2019s hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland clinic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american academy of pediatrics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecuador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. louis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T12:50:26.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2ab467032e04e1bef3d1b6994b9bc2a1b5f597fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wSdYItXMQYqvTpA3Jqw.0mnZjq7mX80XCQuvfStdmdzCXDXPzmjFaWWUQ4DBnu1cfONFObW6K_Lu2VsyNV.D7FQ--", "site_full": "www.vitacost.com", "site": "vitacost.com", "site_section": "http://blog.vitacost.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "VitaVibes Blog | Vitacost.com", "title": "Should You Go Raw? 5 FAQs Answered by a Raw Foods Expert", "title_full": "Should You Go Raw? 5 FAQs Answered by a Raw Foods Expert", "published": "2017-10-06T21:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3482, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ab467032e04e1bef3d1b6994b9bc2a1b5f597fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wSdYItXMQYqvTpA3Jqw.0mnZjq7mX80XCQuvfStdmdzCXDXPzmjFaWWUQ4DBnu1cfONFObW6K_Lu2VsyNV.D7FQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Elyssa Schwartz", "published": "2017-10-06T21:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Should You Go Raw? 5 FAQs Answered by a Raw Foods Expert", "text": "Kiki Powers October 6, 2017 0 Food & Nutrition \nAre you new to the raw vegan dietary approach ? Or maybe you\u2019re just exploring the concept to see if it could benefit you. Either way, you probably have some questions (you\u2019re not alone). Here are the top five questions I hear over and over again from those interested in this lifestyle. If you have any additional questions, leave a comment down below! 1. What exactly is a raw vegan diet ? \nDefinitions vary, but for our purposes here, going raw means building your diet around fresh, whole plant foods such as fruit, land and sea veggies, juices, smoothies, nuts and seeds, as well as sprouted and raw-cultured/ fermented plant foods . \nFrom these highly nutritious, versatile basics you can create countless entr\u00e9es, salads, meals, snacks, beverages, desserts and more. Raw or \u201cliving\u201d foods may comprise up to 100 percent of your diet\u2014though closer to 80 percent raw foods, often referred to as \u201chigh raw,\u201d is generally more common. 2. Are all raw vegan diets alike? \nNo, there are different types of raw vegan diets. For example, many raw foodies are actually fruitarians, meaning they live mainly on fresh fruit, often consumed as \u201cmono meals.\u201d For example, lunch might consist of a huge plate of grapes, or numerous bananas. \nOther raw vegans rely on a more comprehensive menu of fresh produce, nuts and seeds , sprouts, juices and smoothies. The addition of nuts and seeds may increase the odds that you stay raw over time as these nutritional gems keep you feeling happily full and nourished for hours. \nNuts and seeds are also incredibly versatile in meals, snacks, sauces, dressings, dips, milks and more. The most viable raw foods approach is arguably one that incorporates the widest array of vitamins, minerals, protein and moderate amounts of healthy, whole food fats. 3. Is it difficult to switch from a cooked food diet to a raw diet? \nIf you are used to eating mostly cooked food, cutting it out abruptly may feel drastic. Behavior change is typically most successful if flows with your daily lifestyle, which in this case is about making a healthy raw diet work for you \nThat means minimizing discomfort along the way, while also ensuring that you enjoy your meals as you learn new planning and preparation skills. Since new habits typically take at least 21 days to form, be patient while your taste buds and digestive system adapt. \nTo ease in, start incorporating more raw salads and smoothies while you gradually phase out cooked/processed fare. As you start feeling better, it will be easier to continue this positive trend. \nAnd if you just need some ideas to get started, here are several healthy no-cook dinner ideas for busy weeknights . 4. Is a raw plant-based menu realistic for long term? \nAssuming your diet is varied and nutritionally balanced, the answer is yes! And that\u2019s easier than you think, since there is no essential nutrient or amino acid we require for optimal health that is not available in fruit, vegetables, sprouted grains and legumes, sea veggies, nuts and seeds. \nThe colorful world of fresh plant food is bursting with gorgeous variety, flavor, antioxidants, nutrients, phytochemicals, protein and more, and can be ideal for those who value optimal health and longevity, a trim body, natural energy and a radiant glow . \nThe real trick for those in transition is to re-sensitize their taste buds to better appreciate natural food flavors, enhanced with herbs, spices and mineral-rich pink Himalayan crystal salt as desired. 5. Are coffee and wine off limits on a raw vegan diet? \nThat\u2019s a valid question as many health-conscious people enjoy these items on a regular basis. The reality is that you will have the best success going raw if you customize it in a way that suits you\u2014especially if you want to create a regimen you can maintain over time, as opposed to a short-term cleanse or fast. \nAnd there are numerous medical studies showing that coffee and resveratrol-rich red wine are good for you in moderation, which generally means about one cup of coffee and/or glass of wine daily. So, if you enjoy them, you should be able to include them if you wish.

Set aside. In separate bowl, combine matcha with a small amount of water. Stir to form a thick paste. Set aside. In mixing bowl or bowl of stand mixer, add shortening. With hand or stand mixer or with whisk, cream shortening. Little by little, mix in 1-1/3 cup of sifted powdered sugar. Frosting should be soft and creamy, with consistency of gel toothpaste. Add up to 2/3 cup additional powdered sugar if you need to stiffen up frosting or a bit of water to loosen.

Hold bag vertically above cupcake and squeeze a 3/4-inch mound of frosting in center. This will be core of your succulent and you\u2019ll build the petals around it. Hold bag at a slight angle, with the tip nearly touching the base of the mound. Squeeze gently until frosting makes contact with the mound.

Once first row is completed, move to second row. Stagger second row petals between bottom petals. Remember to squeeze until frosting makes contact with center mound, then release pressure as you pull away. Continue this technique to complete final few petals on top. \nNotes: If your petals are not sticking to the mound, your frosting may be too dry. Whisk in a little water and try again.

It would require drastic and immediate lifestyle changes. The upside? For Angie and Steve Keenan, they found a new community and inspiration in the chaos. They found others who not only shared their challenges but inspired them with strength and resolve. \nNow, the couple runs Sit By Me Bakery in Denver, Co, a part-time home bakery, creating allergen-friendly treats for those with and without dietary restrictions. Through their company, they work to raise awareness around specialty diets and the impact they have on lives. \nWe interviewed Angie and Steve to learn about their struggles with Celiac disease and food allergies, how they stay motivated and what they do when they\u2019re not baking delicious treats. 1. Do you follow a specialty diet? \nWe follow a strict gluten-free diet, and also live without many foods due to multiple food allergies. 2. What motivates you? \nOur motivation is simple: as people living with food allergies and Celiac Disease, we make daily food choices to preserve our health and lives! 3. What\u2019s one your favorite foods? \nWe adore rice pasta! It\u2019s the perfect gluten-free base for both cold, vegetable-heavy salads, and hearty, warm dishes like goulash! 4. How often do you exercise? What\u2019s your favorite way to exercise? \nWe live in colorful Colorado which makes hiking in nature easily accessible! Running a small business eats up most of our time and energy, but we try to hit the trails a few times a week. 5. What do you do for a living? What\u2019s your \u201cdream job\u201d? \nIn addition to running Sit By Me Bakery, Steve is an environmental scientist, and I am a writer, contributing to collaborative projects. We are working toward our dream jobs of opening a full-time bakery! (Be sure to check out Angie and Steve\u2019s Succulent Cupcakes with Vegan Matcha Frosting .) 6. Are you married and do you have kids? Do you have pets? \nOur family consists of Steve and I, two young adults, and our two senior pets! 7. Is there a role model you look up to? \nRather than looking up to individual role models, we find meaning in the collective human experience, and the innate desire to learn and grow! 8. What\u2019s the hardest part about healthy living for you? \nAvoiding the foods that make us ill and endanger our lives is a challenge. Outings and adventures take extra planning. We often long for convenience! 9. What\u2019s your favorite way to relax? \nWe take one evening a week to binge watch BBC dramas! 10. Why do you love Vitacost? How long have you been a customer? \nWhen diagnosed with food allergies and Celiac Disease, our cost of living immediately increased. We appreciate Vitacost\u2019s discounted prices on specialty diet staples ! \nWe just had our one year Vitacost anniversary! We know because Vitacost sent us a coupon to celebrate!

In honor of the great fruit, here are a few ways apples help boost your overall health and well-being. 1. Apples protect your heart. \nApples contain a fiber called pectin that is known to lower cholesterol levels, says Brill, who has written three books on heart health, including \u201cCholesterol Down\u201d and \u201cBlood Pressure Down.\u201d \nResearch at the UC Davis Department of Internal Medicine found that regularly eating apples or drinking apple juice can reduce your risk of heart disease in just six weeks. \n\u201cI like to say an apple a day keeps the cardiologist away,\u201d Brill says. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfectly heart-healthy food.\u201d 2. Apples are rich in antioxidants. \nApples contain \u201can incredible amount\u201d of disease-fighting antioxidants, including polyphenols, Brill says. Varieties that are especially rich in antioxidants include Fuji , Red Delicious and Northern Spy. \n\u201cBe sure you eat the skin and don\u2019t peel it,\u201d Brill says. \u201cIf you peel the skin, you throw out the antioxidants.\u201d 3. Apples are rich in fiber. \nA diet rich in fiber can help lower your risk of diabetes and heart disease. But few of us have gotten the news. \u201cAmericans tend to eat ridiculously low amounts of fiber,\u201d Brill says. \u201cSo, you want to bump up your intake of fiber.\u201d \nA medium-sized apple contains about 4.4 grams of fiber, with the peel alone containing about 1 gram of fiber. 4. Apples help you lose weight. \nApples are a great snack if you are hungry, especially if you are trying to lose weight. \u201cIt\u2019s a portable, low-calorie, nutrient-dense sweet treat that you can use to take the edge off,\u201d Brill says. 5. Apples provide other health benefits . \nThe humble apple has tannins that can prevent urinary tract infections, and the fleshy fiber helps scrape your teeth and gums. \nApples are so good for you that Brill calls them \u201cMother Nature\u2019s medicine chest.\u201d Create an apple-rich diet \nAlthough apples are a great part of any diet, Brill urges you to be selective when choosing fruit. \u201cApples are very high in the pesticide department,\u201d she says, citing research from the Environmental Working Group. \nThe organization reports that apples are among the four fruits most contaminated with pesticides . The others are peaches, strawberries and nectarines. \n\u201cYou should try to buy organic if you can,\u201d Brill says. In addition, make sure to wash and rinse your apples before eating them. \nWhen choosing apples, look for firm and shiny fruit. Apples will remain good for up to six months in the refrigerator. \nSome people miss out on an apple\u2019s health benefits, because they simply don\u2019t like the taste of the fruit. If you are an apple skeptic, Brill recommends smearing a bit of peanut butter or almond butter on apple slices to change the taste, and to add a little protein. \nOther people simply hate to eat apples raw. If you dislike the raw fruit, try to combine apples with other foods, like in a broccoli salad or green smoothie. \u201cChop them up and throw them in anything,\u201d Brill says. \nSome people who don\u2019t like raw apples do enjoy dried apple rings. You can also bake apple slices sprinkled with cinnamon in an oven for 30 minutes.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "janet bond brill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national apple month", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "top health benefits of this fall fruit chris kissell october", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "food & nutrition  when", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "uc davis department of internal medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environmental working group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hellertown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fuji", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T00:55:01.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d37846b2d2aa094223c82ceb7214274b29450cc1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wS6ciD5uZYZ1sV8GWxp61K7gqH9u0nGCPCM93cT.z4WglhsXvcBLe71a6C8oofeqgYhrY86mGYiK9wVU..BzLFojDmdhg2Ssx5AS7N0G8Mn0-", "site_full": "www.vitacost.com", "site": "vitacost.com", "site_section": "http://blog.vitacost.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "VitaVibes Blog | Vitacost.com", "title": "Root Beer Float Rice Crispy Treats", "title_full": "Root Beer Float Rice Crispy Treats", "published": "2017-10-10T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3482, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d37846b2d2aa094223c82ceb7214274b29450cc1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wS6ciD5uZYZ1sV8GWxp61K7gqH9u0nGCPCM93cT.z4WglhsXvcBLe71a6C8oofeqgYhrY86mGYiK9wVU..BzLFojDmdhg2Ssx5AS7N0G8Mn0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jazzythings", "published": "2017-10-10T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Root Beer Float Rice Crispy Treats", "text": "jazzythings October 10, 2017 0 Desserts \nDid you grow up ordering a brown cow at the ice cream shop?

Like all well-timed exercise, it helps with sleep. But yoga goes the extra mile in calming your nervous system, thanks in part to its slow and deep breathing and end relaxation portion. \nIf shut-eye hour is rounding the corner and you haven\u2019t packed in strong movement, yoga can still usher you into a peaceful night of zzzs. You\u2019ll be looking for\u2014no surprise\u2014its gentle and restorative poses . \nThe sequence below takes as little as five minutes or can last much longer if you choose. You can do it right before you slide under the covers or earlier in the night if you maintain a quiet state afterward. Release lingering energy \nIt\u2019s hard to suddenly be still if you\u2019re buzzing with even a little energy. This gets it out. Cat-cow Come to your hands and knees, with your wrists under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. As you inhale drop your belly down as you lift your hips and head toward the ceiling, drawing your shoulders away from your ears. As you exhale, round your back like a cat, pulling your chin to your chest and dropping your tailbone. Take as many rounds as you need, perhaps incorporating a sway in your hips. \nTip: If you have osteoporosis or osteopenia, skip cat and move into a flat back instead. If you have wrist issues, come to your forearms, with your elbows under your shoulders, and practice the moves that way. Connect with your breath \nEffortlessly creating space in your upper body allows for deep breaths and room for your hands to feel those breaths expand and contract your torso. Legs up the wall is a classic restorative pose that melts muscle tension. Legs up the wall Sit with a hip about a foot from a wall. Pivot to face the wall, and lie back. Lift your legs, so your heels rest on the wall. Place one hand on your belly, the other near your heart. Begin each inhale with a lift in your belly and continue to draw breath in until it expands your ribcage then chest. Do this to the count of five. Pause for a count. Exhale to the count of six, feeling your front torso release down. Take at least 10 rounds of breath. \nTip: The farther you move your buttocks from the wall, the gentler the pose is on your hamstrings. If your legs begin to splay, secure them gently with a strap . Alternatively you can scoot your buttocks out farther and rest the soles of your feet on the wall, or you can place your calves on a chair or couch. Get drowsy \nThe deep breathing you\u2019ve cultivated activates your parasympathetic ne rvous system , which slows your heart-rate. Keep the slow cadence going as you shift into the final pose. Forward bends are especially calming, turning your attention and senses inward. Supported forward bend Sit and place rolled blankets or towels under your knees so that the backs of your thighs relax as oppose to stretching. Place a pillow or two over your front thighs. Push your fingers or palms into the ground next to your hips to sit up straight and encourage the natural curve of your spine. Hinge forward from your hips without rounding your lower back. Rest your belly and chest on the pillows, and drop your forehead. Stay for as long as you\u2019d like. If it\u2019s hard to breathe with your forehead down, turn your head to one side, later turning it to the other side. \nTip: Even if you\u2019re very flexible and can fold your whole torso over your legs, do the supported version, so you can hold the pose longer. \nMitra Malek, a former Yoga Journal editor, has taught yoga regularly since 2006.

Cuomo, author of A World Without Cancer: The Making of a New Cure and the Real Promise of Prevention . \u201cEverything we do from the moment we wake is a factor that can turn on or off the genetic switches in our body, including ones that could lead to cancer. The risk of many cancers, including breast cancer, can be significantly reduced by living a healthy lifestyle .\u201d \nWith that in mind, and in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, here are six savvy lifestyle improvements you can make today\u2014to beat the odds tomorrow: Breast Cancer Awareness Tip: Keep Your Weight in Check \nA study conducted by the American Cancer Society found that women who put on anywhere from 21 to 30 pounds after the age of eighteen were a whopping 40% more likely to develop breast cancer than those who hadn\u2019t gained more than five pounds. \nWhile we all know that excessive weight gain can do a number on our health, there\u2019s a specific reason behind the hazards it poses in terms of our breasts. \n\u201cThis higher risk is partially because fat cells make estrogen; extra fat cells mean more estrogen in the body, and estrogen can make hormone-receptor-positive breast cancers develop and grow,\u201d says BreastCancer.org . \nWhich brings us to our next point\u2026 Breast Cancer Awareness Tip: Get Your Heart Pumping \nWe don\u2019t need scientists to tell us that exercise can be a huge boon for our brain and body\u2014anyone who has ever walked out of a Vinyasa yoga class knows the truth of this. \nBut did you know that exercise can also work toward preventing breast cancer? \nTake it from a professor of nutrition at the University of Minnesota, Mindy Kruzer, PhD: \u201cAmong women who exercise, the ratio of \u2018good\u2019 estrogens to \u2018bad\u2019 estrogens (those that can damage DNA and increase a woman\u2019s breast cancer risk) improved by roughly 25 percent,\u201d she says. What\u2019s more, \u201cpast research has shown that the greater this ratio, the lower a woman\u2019s breast cancer risk.\u201d As for women who flout exercise altogether? The radio \u201cdidn\u2019t budge.\u201d \nThis isn\u2019t to say you must run a 10K , but it doesn\u2019t suggest a gentle walk here and there suffices, either. \n\u201cSwimming, laps, doing aerobics, jogging\u2014women who engage in strenuous activities like these at least five hours a week, and have done so for most of their adult lives, are 20 percent less likely to develop invasive breast cancer than are sedentary types who get no more than 30 minutes of exercise a week, reports the California Teachers Study, which has been tracking more than 110,000 women ages 20 to 79 since 1995,\u201d Good Housekeeping reports. \nCan\u2019t seem to find the impetus for a major sweat session? Even moderate workouts, like golfing, can \u201ccut the odds of developing one form of breast cancer (estrogen-receptor-negative) for which there are fewer effective treatments,\u201d Good Housekeeping says. Breast Cancer Awareness Tip: Banish Processed Meats \nFrom bacon bits in your Cobb salad to downing a turkey-and-salami sub on a busy day, you may be eating more processed meats than you realize. And while \u201ceverything in moderation (including moderation)\u201d mostly holds true, you may want to reconsider that ham croissant the next time you\u2019re at the bakery. \nWhy? \nThe American Cancer Society reports that processed meats\u2014such as ham, bacon, some deli meats, sausage and bologna\u2014are now considered a \u201cgroup 1\u201d carcinogen by the World Health Organization, placing mortadella and its kin in the same category as tobacco, arsenic, asbestos and alcohol. Speaking of which\u2026 Breast Cancer Awareness Tip: Curb Your Alcohol Intake \nFor some, a chaotic day might \u201ccall\u201d for a glass of wine, but you might want to cut yourself off at one. \n\u201cDrinking more than two alcoholic beverages (defined as a 5-ounce glass of wine or a 12-ounce bottle of beer) a day hikes risk by about 20 percent,\u201d Elle reports. The American Cancer Society adds to this by advising, \u201cEven a few drinks a week is linked with an increased risk of breast cancer in women,\u201d in part because alcohol \u201ccan also raise estrogen levels in the body.\u201d \nWant to enjoy a mojito here and there? Consider upping your intake of the B vitamin, folate. \n\u201cThis risk (of breast cancer) may be especially high in women who do not get enough folate in their diet or through supplements,\u201d the American Cancer Society says. Asparagus, broccoli, avocado, dark leafy greens are all an excellent source of this nutrient. Or, order a virgin Salty Dog next time you\u2019re out: Grapefruit (and its juice) are high in folate, while iodine (found in salt) has been associated with a smaller risk in developing breast tumors . Breast Cancer Awareness Tip: Load Up on Fiber \nEyeing that carton of oatmeal while in line for your latte? Go right ahead. More fiber\u2014both soluble and insoluble\u2014may prevent breast cancer. \n\u201cEvidence from several studies suggests that women who consumed 30 grams of fiber per day had had a 32 percent risk reduction of breast cancer,\u201d Rachel Beller, MS, RD, and Founder of Beller Nutritional Institute told Reader\u2019s Digest . \u201cCompare that to the women who were eating less than 25 grams a day who only showed a 2 percent risk reduction, and you have a clear case for eating more than 30 grams of fiber a day.\u201d \nAnd don\u2019t think fiber is limited to those oats you\u2019re ogling or the bran your mother heaped on your plate: Pears, lentils , oranges, almonds, peas, raisins, apples and carrots are all fiber-rich. Breast Cancer Awareness Tip: Opt Out of the Night Shift (or At Least the All-Nighter) \nSleep isn\u2019t just for beauty. Studies confirm that adequate, restful sleep is a leading defense against illness\u2014and that night shifts, whether in a factory, on a plane or at a club, puts you at an increased risk of breast cancer. In fact, \u201cresearch published in the May 2012 issue of Occupational and Environmental Medicine found that women in the Danish military who worked the night shift were as much as 40 percent more likely to develop breast cancer than those who didn\u2019t burn the midnight oil,\u201d The Guardian says.

Here are some tips for helping your child handle questions and maintain pride over what they eat. \nMany parents and caregivers are met with the same lunch dilemma. You want to pack a healthy lunch for your child , while fulfilling their dietary concerns. The \u201cbattle of the lunch box\u201d doesn\u2019t end at home, as kids are often met with questions and stigma in the cafeteria. The good news is that, whatever their dietary needs, your child isn\u2019t alone. \nSpecial diets are on the rise. Veganism grew by over 350 percent in the U.K. between 2006 and 2016. A 2012 Gallup poll found that five percent of U.S. adults identify as vegetarian, two percent identify as vegan, and those numbers are estimated to be rising. \nData indicates that teens are focusing more on vegetarian and vegan diets , as social media grows their awareness of nutrition and the meat industry. Healthychildren.org says it\u2019s common for grade-schoolers to become vegetarian or vegan when they make the connection between animals and food. \nIn addition to those who opt for special diets, there are many children who need special diets to help manage health conditions like nut allergies , Celiac, and Crohn\u2019s disease. But the abundance of children with unique eating habits and dietary needs doesn\u2019t seem to reduce the number of questions, and even bullying, that many children face over what\u2019s in their lunches. \nSo how can you help your child maneuver the social stigma of a special diet? Walter Gaman, MD , is a family practitioner who treats patients with special dietary considerations, and had to guide his own son through years of packing gluten-free lunches. Gaman says emotional support is key: \n\u201cParents need to understand that there are emotional considerations that come along with dietary restrictions. The more you support your child emotionally, the better it will be for both of you.\u201d \nThat\u2019s good advice, and anybody who has helped a child with feelings of being \u201cdifferent\u201d knows that can be difficult. Jonathan Harrop, LMFT , is a pediatric therapist who focuses on helping kids strengthen their identities and strengthen themselves against bullying. Harrop provides four actions you can take to help your child: Reassure your child of what gives them worth. Children need constant, regular reassurance that they are loved, lovable and are good kids. Many ill-attacks come from children who do not believe they are loved, loveable or are good kids and feel the need to take it out on others and pull others down. Share the truth of why people tease or bully. Help your child understand the reasons people will tease. People who tease or bully often have deep insecurities themselves, so they get together with other insecure kids to pick on others that are different than them to feel good about themselves. They do not bully because they are cool. They bully because they are insecure and feel the need to try to prove their coolness. Help your child see the value in what they eat. Help your child understand why they are eating healthy or have a special diet. If a child understands the reasons for healthy eating, it will strengthen their ability to withstand the attacks that come from other kids around their healthy eating or dietary needs. Practice how to respond to questions or bullying (Harrop calls this \u201cmental Jiu-Jitsu\u201d). If it\u2019s a simple question, help your child practice giving a simple answer. For example: \nClassmate: \u201cThat looks gross. What is it?\u201d \nYour child: \u201cIt\u2019s hummus, and it tastes really good. Would you like to try it?\u201d \nHarrop provides this example to practice in the event of a bully attack: \nBully: \u201cAre you really a vegetarian?\u201d \nYour child: \u201cYep.\u201d (stated confidently) \nBully: \u201cWeirdo.\u201d \nYour child: \u201cWow, thank you. My siblings love me, and they call me weirdo all the time. Are you trying to tell me you love me?\u201d \nThe goal of mental Jiu-Jitsu is to disarm the aggressor. According to Harrop, \u201cThe point is that our response to the verbal blows is not met with blocking, blowing back, or even running away, but is a response that rolls with the punch to throw the person behind you. This is easier for a child to do when they have confidence in themselves, which you can give them, and when they believe in the reason for their health habits.\u201d \nMaintaining a healthy or special diet can be hard enough without being hassled into embarrassment about it. Working with your child to build their confidence and self-worth, along with educating them about their dietary needs will reduce lunch-time stress and help them be successful at feeding their bodies what they need. \nDon\u2019t shy away from enlisting the help of your child\u2019s favorite teacher and the guidance counselor. They may be able to address bullying in the classroom, and it\u2019s always good for kids to know who to turn to when they need additional support. \nLooking for new and exciting recipes to make for your little ones?

Without one, you risk not being able to perform at your optimum level the next day. By cooling down properly, you\u2019ll maximize the results you\u2019re working to achieve. \nAs a fitness professional, there are five things I always do to maximize the benefits of my workouts that help me feel great. And, lucky for you, I\u2019m sharing them all! 1. Foam rolling \nStart your post-workout routine with a restorative foam rolling session to help aid in muscle recovery. Doing this will help you achieve a deeper stretch (see step 2). Using a foam roller to perform self-myofascial techniques (a gentle continuous pressure on the muscles) may reduce soreness , prevent future injury, increase blood flow and circulation, along with improved flexibility. A foam rolling massage on the muscles helps to break up knots in soft tissue. \nThere\u2019s also an added bonus! Another foam rolling benefit is that it\u2019s a much more affordable option than frequent visits to a massage therapist. NOTE: Refrain from foam rolling for more than 20 minutes to avoid overworking an area. 2. Post-workout stretching \nAfter a workout, when muscle are already warmed up, is the perfect time to stretch. Relieving muscle tension, decreasing soreness and improving your range of motion are all benefits reaped by stretching . Isometric stretching should be done to aid in the recovery process. After your workout, hold stretches for at least 15 seconds each. NOTE: Skipping out on stretching may hinder your range of motion for your next workout and cause injury. 3. Post-workout nutrition \nWithin 30-45 minutes after your workout, your body is looking for carbohydrates and protein to rebuild muscle and replenish glycogen. Healthy carbs help with recovery while a clean protein helps to repair and build muscle. Eating the correct nutrients shortly after exercising may help the body recover faster. \nAim for about 20 grams of a quality protein. Either whey or plant-based protein powders are a good choice because they are convenient and absorb rapidly in the body. Fast-acting clean carbohydrates ( oatmeal , bananas) will help replenish glycogen levels, bring energy levels back up, along with bumping insulin levels up. \nMy typical post-workout meals usually consist of a homemade protein smoothie (blended with oatmeal and fruit) or a high-protein cereal sprinkled with protein powder, fruit and almond milk. 4. BCAA\u2019s \nBranched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) are the essential three amino acids needed after a workout. Taking BCAA\u2019s after a strenuous workout may assist in promoting muscle repair and growth, as well as reducing muscle soreness\u2014this way you\u2019re ready to go hard again the next day. The recommended serving, 3-5 grams, can be found in canned tuna , chicken, low fat Greek yogurt or in a convenient BCAA supplement . 5. Cool off \nYou don\u2019t need to hop into an ice bath like a extreme athletes, but taking a cool shower after exercising may help decrease inflammation and speed up the healing process.

From classroom parties to trick-or-treating around the neighborhood, pirates, ghosts and goblins alike run the risk of cross-contamination even when sticking to foods or candy that should be safe. The good news is that awareness is growing regarding food allergies. Even the youngest kids have come to understand that some food allergies are life threatening, and have compassionately risen to the challenge of standing by their food-sensitive friends. Teal Pumpkin Project \nSo, what does it mean when you see a teal pumpkin on Halloween \u2013 and how is this colorful gourd saving lives? \nThe Teal Pumpkin Project is a huge relief to children with food allergies and their parents. It started in 2014, created by the Food Allergy Research & Education non-profit group, as a way to keep Halloween inclusive and safe for all kids. By putting a teal-painted pumpkin on your porch, walkway, or driveway, you can let kids with allergies and parents of kids with allergies know that you are passing out non-food items to trick-or-treaters. \nPencils, erasers, stickers, bubbles, and small inexpensive toys all make great treats. Meanwhile, the treat you\u2019ll be giving parents, the gift of peace of mind, is truly priceless. Be sure to keep these items in a separate bowl, do not mix them with the candy you are passing out, since some children\u2019s food allergies are so sensitive that even the dust on the wrapper from the product can set off an anaphylactic response. \nThen again, you may want to consider skipping candy or food-related treats altogether. Let\u2019s be honest, how many pounds of candy do kids really need? Sure, their parents may take some of it to work for the office, but then how many pounds of candy to we as adults really need? When it comes down to it, we could probably all do with a little less candy and a little more fun in our lives. \nThink about it: Painting a pumpkin teal? Fun! Getting stickers and bubbles? Fun! Seeing kids enjoy a time honored tradition of donning cat ears and creepy clown masks while running through the streets of the neighborhood giggling with joy? Super fun!

Don\u2019t be ashamed. You\u2019re not alone. Research shows that the average American can spend up to half a day staring at screens ! As everyday tasks \u2013 from healthy food shopping to checking the weather \u2013 have become increasingly digitized, it\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re spending more and more time online. \nWhat may be surprising are the effects of all this screen gazing. The bright, harsh light emitted from the screens of digital devices, monitors and TVs is called blue light. It reaches deeper into the eye than UV light and can potentially impact important cells in your eyes. Fortunately, news about blue light exposure \u2013 and information about how to care for your eyes \u2013 is starting to spread. Shedding light on \u2018blue light\u2019 \nScreens use LED lighting to provide brilliant white color, a result of a large volume of high-energy, short-wavelength light on the electromagnetic light spectrum. There are many categories of light of varying wavelength, color and intensity. But this penetrating light can damage the photoreceptors in eyes. \nIn fact, excessive blue light may result in increased free radicals in the macular and retina in your eyes. Free radicals are unstable and highly-reactive atoms with unpaired electrons. They steal electrons from other molecules, creating even more free radicals, which can contribute to the damage of cells. Envisioning better eye care \nEyes are equipped with a nutritional filter made of carotenoids that helps blue light filter through and get absorbed before it reaches the retina at the front of the eye. As a second line of defense, these naturally occurring compounds bind with free radicals produced when blue light does get through, reaching the macula found at the back of the eye. \nTo support your eye health, you need three key compounds: lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin. You can obtain these through diet and supplementation. Dietary sources include leafy greens, like kale and dandelion leaves, which supply key carotenoids for eye health. \nIf you choose an eye health supplement , look for a ratio that includes 10 milligrams of lutein and 2 milligrams of zeaxanthin or 20 milligrams of lutein and 4 milligrams of zeaxanthin. These ratios may support visual function under conditions of glare.* \nNow, power down your digital device and give your eyes a break!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-24T06:53:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15517fa401f6a6bc2f062c4be3e5f4e5656f4037", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wix7rQ0XTXzbzMa5MhQgd0Dlr4WrIo_KtL6MH5n9ok2KPw3FEwMlPMb5eOn2GypdU5SY3QQC1TTmnhu.nMIAIydHamD0pSFs5", "site_full": "www.vitacost.com", "site": "vitacost.com", "site_section": "http://blog.vitacost.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "VitaVibes Blog | Vitacost.com", "title": "Dehydrated Sweet Potato Dog Treats", "title_full": "Dehydrated Sweet Potato Dog Treats", "published": "2017-10-23T18:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3482, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "15517fa401f6a6bc2f062c4be3e5f4e5656f4037", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wix7rQ0XTXzbzMa5MhQgd0Dlr4WrIo_KtL6MH5n9ok2KPw3FEwMlPMb5eOn2GypdU5SY3QQC1TTmnhu.nMIAIydHamD0pSFs5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Liana Werner-Gray", "published": "2017-10-23T18:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dehydrated Sweet Potato Dog Treats", "text": "Liana Werner-Gray October 23, 2017 0 Pets \nWould it surprise you to know that dogs love the taste of sweet potatoes?

Cooler temperatures mean less water content in the air. As your body\u2019s protective barrier against the environment becomes increasingly vulnerable, the typical signs of dry skin start to manifest. You\u2019ll notice itchiness, roughness and irritation, making you reach for the most relieving lotion you can find. But that\u2019s just how to get rid of dry skin after the fact. To help combat the cracking and flaking before it starts, turn to ceramides. Skin ceramides: definition and function \nAccording to the American Skin Association, low humidity is considered to be the most common cause of skin dryness. The outer epidermis contains water-loving lipids called ceramides that help maintain moisture at the surface; thus, aiding in a smooth, \u201cplump\u201d appearance. Without sufficient water to draw from, however, ceramides can\u2019t do their job properly, which contributes to your dry, flaky skin. Phytoceramides: plant-derived lipids \nWhether you fret over flaky cheeks or dryness all over, there\u2019s an advanced moisturizing ingredient with proven benefits that has made its way into both topical skincare and supplements. Phytoceramides are plant-based lipids that mimic the work of naturally occurring ceramides. They absorb moisture and retain it within the epidermis to support smoother, softer skin. \nOften made from wheat, some phytoceramides have been processed to be gluten-free , allowing individuals with wheat sensitivities the benefits of these skin-saving lipids. One such ingredient to look for in a supplement is Ceramosides, which is proprietary and clinically tested. What to use: topical cream or supplement? \nDepending on the condition of your skin and your comprehensive skincare goals, you may decide on a daily regimen that consists of either a topical cream, a supplement or both. Deep-therapy moisturizing lotions with phytoceramides can provide instant relief to dry skin and help calm irritation, as well as supply other targeted ingredients to support skin health. \nFor cumulative, long-term benefits from within, consider a beauty supplement formulated with phytoceramides to deliver moisturizing compounds in concentrations you may not get from topical skincare products. One to look for is Collagen Hydra Protect by Reserveage Nutrition . It features the gluten-free ingredient, Ceramosides, which has been clinically shown to start working in just over two weeks. \u2020 \nDon\u2019t forget about your diet! The food you put in your body can help boost your skin\u2019s moisture content. Opt for meals rich in fatty acids, such as tuna salad and baked salmon , to help shore up the skin barrier. Also, sipping room-temperature water and decaffeinated tea will help hydrate your skin when the temperature drops.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "reserveage nutrition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american skin association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-24T19:04:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f9966567e79cdf8797877535ccfcd20679733b89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wJcpmreEbT1gmHo67IWk3edFI_mK2k9B0_RK74VuGla2OgSPjkHgsDrKmr0geta416QjkDOxf28A7aYFir4ALlH5vdjetJH70", "site_full": "www.vitacost.com", "site": "vitacost.com", "site_section": "http://blog.vitacost.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "VitaVibes Blog | Vitacost.com", "title": "Red Light! 5 Signs You Should Stop Your Workout", "title_full": "Red Light! 5 Signs You Should Stop Your Workout", "published": "2017-10-24T23:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3482, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f9966567e79cdf8797877535ccfcd20679733b89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wJcpmreEbT1gmHo67IWk3edFI_mK2k9B0_RK74VuGla2OgSPjkHgsDrKmr0geta416QjkDOxf28A7aYFir4ALlH5vdjetJH70", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jessica Thiefels", "published": "2017-10-24T23:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Red Light! 5 Signs You Should Stop Your Workout", "text": "Jessica Thiefels October 24, 2017 0 Sports and Fitness \nIt\u2019s normal to be out of breath, feel slight muscle strain and have an elevated heart rate during exercise . What\u2019s not normal is a rapid heart rate accompanied by dizziness and shortness of breath followed by tightness in your chest or acute pain followed by loss of strength or stability. \nThese are all signs that you should stop your workout immediately, and we turned to the pros, from doctors to personal trainers and exercise physiologists, to find out why. Keep the following warning signs in mind if something feels abnormal during your next workout. 1. Your heart rate spikes higher than normal \nThe cause could be as simple as dehydration or as complex as an abnormal heart condition. \nHeart rate monitors and fitness trackers help you work your hardest, allowing you to track heart rate, and therefore exertion, during the workout. Your tracker is also a great tool to make sure everything is going OK during exercise: \n\u201cIf you\u2019re wearing a fitness tracker and notice your heart rate spiking abnormally, especially beyond your max heart rate and not normalizing after stopping for rest between sets, stop immediately and seek help,\u201d suggests the owner of TrapFit with Tini . \nTo stay aware of this potential issue, you need to know your max heart rate and average heart rate during a normal workout. Start by finding your max heart rate, which you can do with this calculation: 220 minus your age. \nWhile not 100 percent accurate, it provides a good baseline. Then make note of your heart rate during three workouts that represent a normal training session for you. \nNow you know what your max heart rate should be in addition to what you average in regular conditions. This way, you\u2019ll know if the numbers fluctuate extremely. Call your doctor immediately if notice any abnormalities. 2. You feel faint, confused or dizzy \nThe cause could be low blood sugar , otherwise known as hypoglycemia. This can happen if/when you work out on an empty stomach. \nYou\u2019ve probably heard mixed opinions on eating before working out from those who promote fasted cardio to the professionals who recommend eating at least 1 to 2 hours before exercise. If you choose to work out before eating, pay attention to potential bodily cues telling you to stop, says Dr. Nina Watson , Certified Diagnostic Radiologist, with expertise in women\u2019s wellness, fitness and nutrition. \n\u201cIf during your workout you begin to experience unusual tiredness, shakiness, racing heart rate, that progress to the point where you begin to feel like you are going to pass out or are confused, and you have changes with your vision, it\u2019s time to stop your workout immediately,\u201d says Watson. \nIf you know you haven\u2019t eaten yet today, or in a few hours, your first step is to eat something small, high in sugar and carbohydrates, like a banana and peanut butter , an apple with cheese or a juice box. If you still don\u2019t feel better, see your doctor or a health professional. 3. You feel a sharp pain in your joint \nThe cause could be an injury or tear in your joint, muscle, tissue or ligaments. \nIf you feel a sharp pain in a joint that\u2019s followed by a decrease in strength or stability or sudden swelling, it\u2019s time to stop, suggests Vivian Eisenstadt , MAPT, CPT, MASP, orthopedic physical therapist and personal trainer. She explains, \u201cThis usually means you have torn something or have injured yourself. Continuing to work out on a newly injured unstable joint can make it much worse. Stop immediately, ice and assess it.\u201d \nSee a doctor as soon as you can to determine the extent of the damage. Avoid putting pressure, on the area, even as you rest or walk around at home, until you know what happened. 4. You reach technical failure on an exercise \nThe cause is likely that you\u2019re tired and it\u2019s time to rest. \nIt\u2019s critical that you always perform your exercises with the correct form . When you become fatigued, however, form is often the first thing to falter, which is what Bruce Kelly , MS, CSCS, NASM-PES, FMS, means by \u201ctechnical failure.\u201d He explains: \n\u201cWhen your form/technique is not good, stop the set/exercise. Nothing good will come out of what follows. You are either inviting injury, at worst, or ingraining poor motor/movement patterns which may not be injurious immediately but leads to problems down the road.\u201d \nThe key is to listen to your body. Tanya Otterstein-Liehs, owner of Body Business , shares a few technical failure signs to look for: When performing a bicep curl, you use your back/shoulder to throw the weight up and perform the curl. When you sink your glutes back and down to perform a squat, but your chest falls forward and your knees are moving forward, going past your toes. When you\u2019re doing a sit up, and you\u2019re no longer engaging your abdominal muscles to curl up, but instead, are pulling on your neck muscles and back to curl up. \nWorking when fatigued to this point could lead to injuries or strained muscles, so stop and resume another day when you\u2019re ready to keep proper form. 5. You feel any signs of heart trouble \nThe cause could be a wide range of issues, from an oncoming heart attack to poor digestion. \nWhen working out, there are a number of signs that tell you to stop because of potential issues with your heart. Jeremy Kring , MS, CPT, CSS suggests these signs include, but are not limited to: Chest pain Excessive rise in blood pressure (if you have wearable that tells you the blood pressure) that is >250 mmHg systolic or >150 mmHG diastolic. Shooting pain in left arm \nIf you feel pain or discomfort, Sheri Traxler , M.Ed. suggests taking the following steps: \u201cStop. Evaluate if it is cardiac or digestive issues . If other signs/symptoms or severity indicate possible cardiac issues, do not resume a workout and get medical help immediately.\u201d Watch for the signs \nDon\u2019t be scared to work out because of potential dangers. Simply knowing what to look for and when to stop is often enough to discover any potential issues before they become a problem. Ask for help from someone in the gym or a person walking by if necessary and consult with your doctor as soon as you can to ensure there are not further problems to be concerned about. \nOtherwise, enjoy getting stronger and fitter with each successful workout and always be aware of what your body is telling you.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-25T02:12:23.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c86b1b856806cbf74e354471fc6767792d5ad56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wS6ciD5uZYZ1sV8GWxp61K7pEb7Y9Lh.d3EZY0dRnbBfYvkT6CPXzt.kdkISXbLNCeG9V9nL2S98GpftBvV5Cu_PEAcfv4esBuChFPmdGj2o-", "site_full": "www.vitacost.com", "site": "vitacost.com", "site_section": "http://blog.vitacost.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "VitaVibes Blog | Vitacost.com", "title": "Coconut Oil Chicken Cutlets", "title_full": "Coconut Oil Chicken Cutlets", "published": "2017-10-24T23:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3482, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c86b1b856806cbf74e354471fc6767792d5ad56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wS6ciD5uZYZ1sV8GWxp61K7pEb7Y9Lh.d3EZY0dRnbBfYvkT6CPXzt.kdkISXbLNCeG9V9nL2S98GpftBvV5Cu_PEAcfv4esBuChFPmdGj2o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Paleoista", "published": "2017-10-24T23:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Coconut Oil Chicken Cutlets", "text": "Remove skin and bones, saving for a stock or bone broth.

In this old world view, the belief is that hard work is the only way to achieve a goal.\u201d \nBut we can trade that approach for something far more profound and fun, according to Sanghvi, who uses somatic and mindfulness techniques to help people reconnect with their body\u2019s innate wisdom. \n\u201cI\u2019d like to suggest a new definition of willpower: acting in service of your higher self,\u201d she says. \u201cIn other words, let your actions be in service of your intuition \u2013 that wise part of yourself which knows your deepest desires and the way to reach them.\u201d \nEr, sounds complicated and kind of hard. But it doesn\u2019t have to be. Mostly it takes some practice. Here\u2019s Sanghvi\u2019s strategy: 1. Know what you want \nUse intuition to home in on your willpower aspiration. In other words: Go with your gut. \nOne way to start listening to your gut is to sit quietly for 10 minutes. Once you\u2019ve settled in, think of something that makes you happy (the beach, your dog), and then notice how your body reacts (a slight smile, softening in your shoulders). That\u2019s your gut talking. \nNext, start thinking of situations in your life, and then notice if those pleasurable sensations remain \u2013 or shift to discomfort (a knot in the stomach, your jaw tightening). \nDo this for a few days. Then introduce things you\u2019d like to change in your life. At this point, you\u2019ll be more attuned to your gut and able to use it to clarify your willpower goal. \n\u201cMost people are driven by other people\u2019s goals. Once you know who you are and what you truly want, you are powerful,\u201d Sanghvi says. \nTo be sure: Intuition is not the same thing as following your habits. As an extreme example, say you grew up with a verbally abusive parent. You might later be attracted to a verbally abusive partner \u2013 you\u2019re following a very strong habit, not your intuition. \n\u201cThat feeling of painful love is like an addiction,\u201d Sanghvi says. \u201cThere\u2019s a pull towards the familiar.\u201d \nThe first step in avoiding that pull (and it can apply to all sorts of habits, from overeating to biting your nails) is to notice that it\u2019s painful in some way. So beneath that attraction there is a physical awareness of pain (for example, you feel badly about yourself when your partner berates you), which you can listen to \u2013 if you allow yourself enough patience to identify it. \nNext you have to work through it, which can be a big challenge (and might require a caring therapist). Until you do, you might not be in touch with your gut. \n\u201cUnfortunately, stress and trauma creates mind-body dissociation. For those of us who have had trauma, it is very uncomfortable to be present with sensation in the body,\u201d Sanghvi says. \u201cWe tend to navigate life from the neck up, with the mind, making decisions without the input of intuition.\u201d \nAs you move through the process below, continually return to step 1 to notice what your gut is saying. 2. Start small \nFocus on the start. \n\u201cDon\u2019t obsess about the finish line, or you\u2019ll never get there,\u201d Sanghvi says. \u201cObsess about the starting line.\u201d \nLet\u2019s say you\u2019d like to change your social media habits so that eventually you barely check all those feeds. Experiment with shutting off your phone or blocking sites from your laptop for one hour a day. Then notice how you feel. \n\u201cBe curious about what emotional payoff you get from being on Facebook and Instagram,\u201d Sanghvi says. \u201cIs your addiction motivated by boredom? By a need to connect with others? Is it a way of avoiding a job you don\u2019t like?\u201d (Exercises in step 1 are useful here.) 3. Help yourself \nWe are more likely to want something if it\u2019s right in front of us. \nSo leave your phone in another room. If you\u2019re not ready to delete Facebook from your phone, make it harder to find. Put social media apps inside nested folders, so it takes at least three clicks to get to them, Sanghvi suggests. \nIf you\u2019re on Facebook a lot because you crave social connection (which you discovered in step 2) establish other ways to connect with people: call a friend, take a group glass . 4. Get specific \nHave a plan and put your action steps on your calendar. \nThat might mean gradually increasing how long you stay away from social media each day, until you check it once every few weeks. \nRemember: Take time to notice what you feel as you follow this new pattern (returning to exercises in step 1). 5. Be nice to yourself \nUse self-compassion when you get off track. \n\u201cIt\u2019s time to let go of the idea that if we resist temptation and get a lot done, we are somehow good, and if we give in to temptation and procrastination, we are bad,\u201d Sanghvi says. \u201cLet\u2019s not confuse willpower with virtue.\u201d \nPlus, humans tend to be motivated by positive reinforcement \u2013 not negative feedback. \n\u201cThe guilt and shame that arise from telling ourselves we are bad, lazy and stupid are deeply painful emotions,\u201d Sanghvi says. \u201cEmotional discomfort often leads us to numb ourselves with the very behaviors we are trying to quit.\u201d \nConnect with journalist and wellness writer Mitra Malek at mitramalek.com .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-25T18:23:05.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ff20e664ac56496cd181525a661f59243401a95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wS6ciD5uZYZ1sV8GWxp61K424Kjg6icHW9IFoKd3q8aizzC9V2PvfhDtwlVaKo5abKSCTSwxH9k3OZGVs6c_pnA--", "site_full": "www.vitacost.com", "site": "vitacost.com", "site_section": "http://blog.vitacost.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "VitaVibes Blog | Vitacost.com", "title": "Game Day Sweet & Smoky Slow Cooker Wings", "title_full": "Game Day Sweet & Smoky Slow Cooker Wings", "published": "2017-10-25T23:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3482, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ff20e664ac56496cd181525a661f59243401a95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wS6ciD5uZYZ1sV8GWxp61K424Kjg6icHW9IFoKd3q8aizzC9V2PvfhDtwlVaKo5abKSCTSwxH9k3OZGVs6c_pnA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Frontier Co-op", "published": "2017-10-25T23:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Game Day Sweet & Smoky Slow Cooker Wings", "text": "Directions On clean surface, arrange chicken wings and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Many people shy away from it simply because of its off-putting aroma, while others are either highly allergic or simply don\u2019t like the taste of fish. If you haven\u2019t quite decided whether fish is a favorite or not, these seafood facts may offer some interesting insight. Fish fact #1: Seafood is full of good fats \nOmega-3 essential fatty acids are an essential part of the human diet. The most widely researched omega-3s are DHA and EPA, which prove to be beneficial in supporting heart health, brain function as well as normal growth and development (especially during the prenatal phase). Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are so important to heart health that the American Heart Association recommends two servings of fish each week . One serving is about the size of a deck of cards. Fish fact #2: Fish requires special storing for safe eating \nFresh fish should be consumed within two days of purchase or wrapped in aluminum foil and stored in the freezer. When cooking, fish should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F. Try coating the fish in a marinade with dried herbs and baking for a moist and flaky texture. For a smoky flavor, throw your fillet on the grill. No meat thermometer? A general rule of thumb is to watch the flesh turn opaque. \nAlso, keep your nose up for an important warning sign. If you smell an ammonia-like odor, this indicates spoilage and the fish should not be eaten. Always be careful with raw seafood, such as sushi rolls , especially if you are pregnant or at higher risk for foodborne illnesses. If you decide to eat your seafood raw, check to see if it was previously frozen, as this will kill some of the harmful parasites. Fish fact #3: Farm-raised and wild-caught have similar nutritional qualities \nFarm-raised fish is a newer concept that has many wondering if it\u2019s a better alternative to the traditional method of catching fish from the sea. Ninety percent of fish in the U.S. are imported, half of which are farm-raised. All imported food is highly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure safety for consumers; that includes both wild and farm-raised fish . \nThe nutritional quality of the fish will be very similar since their high concentration of omega-3s comes from eating other fish and algae, both of which are found in the ocean or added to the farm fish\u2019s diet.

For some kids, it\u2019s not so laid back and care free. With food allergies and intolerances on the rise, indulging in a classic Halloween treat can cause harm, or in some cases, can even be deadly. While that all sounds scary (and it is!), there are ways you can help bring back the fun for everyone. \nThese allergy-free Halloween activities for kids are a guaranteed good time! \n1. Paint pumpkins teal \nFood Allergy & Research Education (FARE) is the world\u2019s largest non-profit organization dedicated to food allergy awareness, education, research and advocacy. The Teal Pumpkin Project , created by FARE, was started in 2014 with the belief that every child should be able to experience the magic of Halloween and the fun tradition of trick-or-treating. To take part, people place a teal pumpkin outside of their home to indicate they have non-food treats available \u2013 perfect for those with food allergies! \n2. Stock up on allergy-free treats \nThere\u2019s plenty of allergy-friendly candy and chocolate to hand out as special treats on Halloween. Just be sure your stash is free-from the top eight most common food allergens: wheat, dairy, peanuts, tree nuts, egg, soy, fish and shellfish. These eight specific allergens account for 90 percent of all food allergies in the U.S. \n3. Carve out some craft time \nPumpkin carving never gets old\u2014truly never . Plus, there\u2019s the process of picking out the perfect pumpkin. You get to spend a crisp, fall day roaming through a pumpkin patch, and drinking hot apple cider. When you get home, you\u2019re ready to carve your perfectly round pumpkin. Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not a master artist. Download this printable jack-o-lantern stencil , complete with chocolate chip eyes and a big, toothy grin! \n4. Throw a spook-tacular party \nInvite all your favorite guys and ghouls for a costume party. This is a great excuse to go overboard on Halloween decorations.

Once you\u2019ve overhauled your closet, turn your attention to your skincare products . \nJust as you swap out tank tops and shorts for wrap sweaters and bootcut jeans, so too should you reexamine your skincare routine and make changes to the products you\u2019re using this fall. \n\u201cFall is a time to reset the skin. We\u2019re transitioning from the lazy days of summer to fall, which is when you get back into your regular routine, including getting back into good skincare habits,\u201d says Renee Rouleau, celebrity esthetician and founder of Renee Rouleau Skin Care . \nAs humidity drops, skin can become dull and dry . That dewy, healthy glow you were rocking during the summer can fade as dry, dead skin cells form a layer on the surface of your face. Luckily, making a few small tweaks to your skincare regimen can revitalize your complexion. \nGrab your favorite pumpkin spice treat , and take note of these fall skincare tips from the pros. 1. Rethink your cleanser and moisturizer \nRouleau recommends most people change their cleansing routine for fall. While gel cleansers are better in summer, a moisturizing cleansing lotion is more appropriate in the fall. \u201cUse a milder cleanser. The air is dryer in the fall, so switch to a moisturizer that\u2019s richer, thicker, and not greasy,\u201d she says, adding that it\u2019s a good idea to switch from a clay mask to a more hydrating gel-based mask . \nCourtney Dunlop, former beauty editor and owner of Good Skin Day , an indie skincare shop in Springfield, Mo., tells customers the easiest tweak to make for fall is to switch to a different cleanser. \u201cIf you live in a dry climate, switching to a cream cleanser or cleansing oil can make a huge difference, even if you don\u2019t change anything else in your skincare routine. Cleansing oils are gentle and clean well,\u201d she says. 2. Use toner \nA recent toner convert, Dunlop says many women don\u2019t realize the benefits of this often overlooked skincare product, which should be used after cleanser. \u201c Adding a toner to your routine can help you maintain moisture levels, but you have to choose alcohol-free ones,\u201d she advises. \nDunlop likes to explain how toners work with a dry sponge analogy. Think of your skin as a dry sponge. If you put soap on a dry sponge, the soap just pools on top. But if the sponge is wet, the soap soaks right in. \u201cThe purpose of toner is to saturate skin with moisture, preparing the skin to absorb what\u2019s next, which can be a serum or moisturizer. The toner helps skin absorb those products more effectively, helping you retain moisture,\u201d she says. 3. Assess and repair sun damage \nIf you went overboard with sun exposure during the summer, don\u2019t panic. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to repair sun damage ,\u201d Rouleau says. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to get a facial and have your esthetician tweak your routine to focus on more retinol use, as well as trying to resurface the skin and fade discoloration.\u201d \nShe encourages women who stopped using a retinol serum in the summer to incorporate the product back into their routine. She explains that retinol products increase exfoliation and help to clear clogged pores and diminish the signs of sun damage. 4. Don\u2019t forget SPF \nJust because it\u2019s cooler outside doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re suddenly immune from sunburn. That\u2019s the message Rouleau preaches to her clients each fall. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to keep wearing your sunscreen every day. End of summer is also a good time of year to get a skin cancer screening,\u201d she adds.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "renee rouleau skin care", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rouleau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dunlop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "renee rouleau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "courtney dunlop", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "springfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mo.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-30T22:54:19.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c68f0d298e1c3851711340684241cfacdc05ba67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wS6ciD5uZYZ1sV8GWxp61KwUT5_vbVACgJXxCszbq3yeCPb5HuGuglMaZnrAB8QO8fVPgl_BuFKgeTWQEth.Aiw--", "site_full": "www.vitacost.com", "site": "vitacost.com", "site_section": "http://blog.vitacost.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "VitaVibes Blog | Vitacost.com", "title": "3 Easy Party Treats to Celebrate Fall", "title_full": "3 Easy Party Treats to Celebrate Fall", "published": "2017-10-31T01:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3482, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c68f0d298e1c3851711340684241cfacdc05ba67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRW70fgQgq.YD2skhWM8X1wS6ciD5uZYZ1sV8GWxp61KwUT5_vbVACgJXxCszbq3yeCPb5HuGuglMaZnrAB8QO8fVPgl_BuFKgeTWQEth.Aiw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brittany", "published": "2017-10-31T01:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "3 Easy Party Treats to Celebrate Fall", "text": "Brittany October 30, 2017 0 Cooking/Recipe \nWhat kind of celebration doesn\u2019t come with food?

Years ago, egg substitutes got their start with a powdered replacer that worked like a one-size-fits-all fix. It was a mixture of a leavening agent with starch, which performed double duty. Not only did it offer binding power, but this powdered replacer added lift to eggless batter. The idea was to create a taste similar to the original. While that worked for a while, today\u2019s baker has started to explore other options for what to use instead of eggs . \nNow, there are much more creative alternatives to eggs in cakes, cookies , breads, brownies, puddings and even ice cream. Not only are these treats possible without eggs , but you can get by without any extra ingredients in your pantry. Here are the six best egg substitutes for your baked goods. \nWarning: Every time you see an egg in a recipe, know that it has a role. It might provide structure, deliver rise and lift, work as an emulsifier, create tenderness, increase shelf life or add moisture and color. You need to know the eggs\u2019 function before you take another step or stir. This will make substituting for eggs much simpler for you. Flax meal \nTake the blondies recipe below, for example. The blondies use a flax egg method , which adds moisture, increases shelf life but also adds density. The density and moisture are pertinent to blondies (and brownies), so it works well in this context without needing the airiness or flavor that eggs deliver. The general substitution for 1 egg is 1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds mixed with 3 tablespoons warm water. Powdered egg replacer \nPowdered egg replacer is designed to add a little bit of lift similar to baking powder, as well as the ability to bind. If you like cakey-ness, this is the best egg substitute for you. A DIY option is easy to make and works just as well as store-bought. Mix 1/4 teaspoon baking powder and 1 tablespoon tapioca flour , and add to your batter for better baking. Aquafaba \nAquafaba is the liquid leftover from a drained can of chickpeas . This egg substitute is similar to using an egg white. The end result is close to what you get with flax meal, minus the shelf-life stability, since it\u2019s a little less moist in the long-term. To create 1 \u201cegg,\u201d you\u2019ll need 3 tablespoons aquafaba. Chia seeds \nChia seeds can also work like the flax egg. They gel up, making this the perfect replacement in dense desserts, such as blondies and brownies. However, be wary of going cuckoo for chia seeds. Too much in treats like breads or cakes can result in an under-baked texture. Apple cider vinegar \nApple cider vinegar is a magical ingredient for baking. It adds texture, shelf-life and lift \u2013 much of what an egg does but also assists dairy- and gluten-free recipes . Use 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar per egg to deliver a little more oomph, especially when the recipe is vying for a lighter texture (cakes or breads). Dairy-free milk & mashed fruits \nWhen it\u2019s the egg\u2019s role to add moisture, dairy-free milk works just fine \u2013 especially when it has a bit of fat. Alternatively, you can use mashed fruits or vegetables, like applesauce, banana or pumpkin puree. These also add moisture, as well as a bit of binding power, density shelf-life, and taste. \nFor some additional guidance, here are some tips to keep in mind: When you start replacing eggs in recipes, work with recipes you\u2019ve made in the past. This will give you an idea of what the batter should look like before you bake. Once you expand your experimentation, look for recipes that just have one egg to replace. It\u2019s easier to start small and work your way up. Keep in mind egg replacements that add density. You can\u2019t replace four eggs in a pound cake with applesauce and expect similar results. Mix and match your egg replacers. If a recipe calls for two or three eggs, pick and choose the features of the replacers that you need (for example, lift and moisture). Use one of each for optimal results.

You can do something about it. October is Adopt-a-Shelter-Dog Month, the perfect time to consider rescuing a dog. \n\u201cFor every dog that people rescue, they are saving a life,\u201d says Kristi Littrell, adoptions manager at the Best Friends Animal Society , a national animal rescue and advocacy organization. \nHowever, don\u2019t let your emotions get the best of you. It\u2019s easy to look in to those puppy-dog eyes, swoon over that wagging tail and rush into a decision that can end up being a mistake. \nInstead, take the time to investigate your wants and needs so you adopt a dog that is the perfect fit for your home and family. Finding the right dog to adopt \nBefore you adopt, understand the commitment you are about to make. It is possible you could have your new best friend for a decade or longer. \nOnce you\u2019ve determined you\u2019re ready for a dog, zero in on the type that is right for you. \nFor example, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals says a puppy is probably not the best choice if you have young children. In that situation, a medium-sized dog that is at least 5 months old makes more sense. \nIf you plan to adopt your dog from a shelter, it\u2019s likely the staff will help you find the right match by asking a few key questions, such as: Do you own or rent? How many children do you have, and how old are they? Do you have other pets? Have you ever had pets in the past? How active are you, and what is your lifestyle like? \nIf you find a dog you like, talk with staff members who have spent time around the dog. Learn as much as you can about the dog\u2019s history and personality. \n\u201cLook at the age and size of the dog,\u201d Littrell says. \u2018Ask the staff how active they appear to be to help determine which dog is actually a match for your lifestyle.\u201d \nIf possible, arrange an outing or sleepover with the dog. Or, ask if the shelter has a policy that allows you to be a foster parent to a dog before adopting. Seeing the dog inside your home can provide crucial insights into its personality and behavior. \n\u201cOften, dogs are different in a home than they are at the shelter,\u201d Littrell says. \nOnce you find the right dog and bring it home, show some patience. \u201cRemember that the dog\u2019s entire world has changed,\u201d Littrell says. \u201cThey need time to adjust.\u201d \nCreate a welcoming environment for the dog.

As one of the best cities to live in America , Naples sets the standard high. \nAccording to the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index , the Naples area boasts the highest level of healthy eating among 189 U.S. metro areas surveyed in 2015-16. In the Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island area, 75.3 percent of adults reported having eaten healthy the entire previous day, barely outdoing Barnstable Town, MA, at 75.1 percent. \nHand in hand with that finding, the Gallup-Sharecare index has ranked the Naples area as the best metro area for overall well-being for two years in a row. This ranking takes into account physical, financial, social, community and purpose-in-life factors, and Naples scores well in each of those five categories. \n\u201cWe know that when people have higher levels of well-being, they are more likely to eat healthy, be active, and surround themselves with people who support their efforts to achieve and sustain good health,\u201d says Deb Logan, executive director of the Blue Zones Project of Southwest Florida, a community wellness initiative. \nSo, are residents of the Naples area imbibing some sort of magic potion? Why are they so happy and healthy? Well, their focus on quality nutrition certainly helps. \nThe large population of retired baby boomers may be at the root of the penchant for healthy eating. As the Naples Herald explains , when boomers retire to the area, they bring with them dietary needs such as low-sodium, low-cholesterol, gluten-free and sugar-free diets. \n\u201cOrganic growers and fresh produce stands are making it easier for restaurants to accommodate these diets,\u201d according to the Naples Herald. \nThe main driver of the region\u2019s healthy eating movement is the NCH Healthcare System , which sponsors the Blue Zones Project. The project collaborates with employers, schools, homeowners associations, faith-based organizations, restaurants, grocery stores and policy leaders to help local residents make healthier choices. \nFor instance, Logan says her organization works with schools, businesses, government offices, parks and others to: Encourage healthier options in vending machines. Urge consumption of more water . Create community gardens. \nMeanwhile, restaurants earn Blue Zones recognition when they put plant-based dishes on their menus, and grocery stores receive kudos for setting up checkout lanes where shoppers are tempted by fresh fruits, nuts and bottled water rather than soda and candy, Logan says. In addition, grocers are persuaded to sell \u201cgrab and go\u201d plant-based dishes and to rearrange cereal aisles, so the healthiest products are at a child\u2019s eye level. \nBeyond that, Blue Zones promotes food drives that focus on donations of healthy products rather than cast-off items from kitchen cabinets, according to Logan; and it asks vendors at farmers markets to accept SNAP benefits (previously known as food stamps) for purchases of produce and other healthy foods. \nAlso, Logan notes, the region is blessed with fresh produce grown in the farming community of Immokalee, which is a major supplier of produce throughout the country. The community also boasts an abundance of farmers markets, making the fresh produce even more accessible. \nFor its part, the NCH Healthcare System, whose network includes more than 700 physicians and dozens of medical facilities, rotates a regularly scheduled farmers market among three locations. The NCH farmers market has spawned formation of small groups whose members have learned to cook healthier meals and have leaned on each other for weight-loss support. \nNCH has gone even further, though. \nIn 2016, the healthcare system banned sugar-sweetened beverages from its cafeterias and vending machines. That led to a $7,000-a-month drop in soda sales. Put another way: That eliminated about 500 pounds of sugar each month from people\u2019s diets. Also in the cafeterias, NCH has reduced entre\u0301e portions and yanked unhealthy foods from salad bars. \nLogan describes Blue Zones as a communitywide effort. \n\u201cIt is a \u2018we\u2019 project,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we all do a little bit to encourage healthy behaviors, we can make a great impact now and for generations to come.\u201d \nLogan adds: \u201cIt\u2019s not a quick fix or a fad, but rather a grassroots initiative which positively transforms the environment in which we eat, play, work and live.\u201d \nDan Witters, research director for the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index, says the Naples area has latched onto the critical role played by holistic well-being, with a focus on the physical, financial, social, community and purpose-of-life elements identified by Witters and his colleagues. \n\u201cIt\u2019s always a smart idea for communities to implement programs to encourage good eating habits, from mobile farmers markets to certifying restaurants and groceries to getting rid of the deep-fat fryer in the schools,\u201d Witters says. \n\u201cBut the biggest thing that Naples has figured out,\u201d he adds, \u201cis that oftentimes the keys to good well-being in one element can be found in other elements. This is what it means to be holistic, and it is a common feature of all [of Gallup-Sharecare\u2019s] highest well-being places.\u201d \nIf you\u2019d like to investigate what other communities are doing to be smarter about how we fuel our bodies, here\u2019s the Gallup-Sharecare list of the top 10 metro areas for healthy eating: Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island, Florida, 75.3 percent Barnstable Town, Massachusetts, 75.1 percent Santa Cruz-Watsonville, California, 74.2 percent Salinas, California, 72.9 percent Santa Rosa, California, 72.3 percent Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Beaufort, South Carolina, 72 percent San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles-Arroyo Grande, California, 72 percent Lake Havasu City-Kingman, Arizona, 71 percent El Paso, Texas, 70.9 percent", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-01T23:40:59.000+02:00"}], "totalResults": 56, "moreResultsAvailable": 0, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=1eee5ef1-4d51-497e-9e88-ed86353bcda9&format=json&ts=1509572459000&q=language%3Aenglish+site%3Avitacost.com&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 865}
