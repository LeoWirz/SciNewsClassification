I tried the Cranberry-Orange flavor for breakfast and it was quite a treat! All you have to do is pour boiling water in the cup, stir, wait for two minutes, and you have a delightful and filling breakfast or snack ready to go without creating dishes for you to clean up afterwards. The oatmeal cup contains more than just oats; it has chunks of almond, cranberry, and orange mixed in, as well as flax and chia. This provides a variety in the texture and adds an extra tangy flavor to the oatmeal. Bob\u2019s Red Mill instant organic oatmeal cup satisfies the taste buds and the tummy. I\u2019m very excited to try their other flavors which include Apple-Cinnamon, Blueberry-Hazelnut, Brown Sugar-Maple, and classic plain oats.\nTo learn more about this and other Bob\u2019s Red Mill oatmeal cup products, see: http://www.bobsredmill.com/shop/oats/cups.html \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brigette dumais bob", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brown sugar-maple", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "red mill company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red mill", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T16:00:37.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45b9e7717c2bf2336173d836af1b87adc42bf5c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.RbhMprE3fuVLf6oTPyMMCPgUsedBDrxSOTKdi2NifkL8MZV4XYlsyxRvyBRe2INJE6fG9yW5XM82zAvyHhx4hNazotkaIwE_jixjsAVfT2Ij0lAQB2T.1w_POcAkx6soiIh0.kEgjsg--", "site_full": "www.vrg.org", "site": "vrg.org", "site_section": "http://www.vrg.org/blog", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The VRG Blog", "title": "VEGAN MAIL ORDER/VOLUNTEER COORDINATOR FOR THE VEGETARIAN RESOURCE GROUP", "title_full": "VEGAN MAIL ORDER/VOLUNTEER COORDINATOR FOR THE VEGETARIAN RESOURCE GROUP", "published": "2017-10-10T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45b9e7717c2bf2336173d836af1b87adc42bf5c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.RbhMprE3fuVLf6oTPyMMCPgUsedBDrxSOTKdi2NifkL8MZV4XYlsyxRvyBRe2INJE6fG9yW5XM82zAvyHhx4hNazotkaIwE_jixjsAVfT2Ij0lAQB2T.1w_POcAkx6soiIh0.kEgjsg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The VRG Blog Editor", "published": "2017-10-10T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "VEGAN MAIL ORDER/VOLUNTEER COORDINATOR FOR THE VEGETARIAN RESOURCE GROUP", "text": "Vegan group seeks Jack or Jill of all trades good at multi-tasking for part-time job 20 hours per week in Baltimore, Maryland. $12/hour salary.

At the same time we\u2019re encouraging them to see that the demand for vegan food will be increasing steadily in the near future.\nTo see VRG\u2019s list of Vegetarian and Vegan Options in Senior Independent Living, Assisted Living, Nursing Home, and Other Senior Facilities visit: http://www.vrg.org/seniors/senior_vegan.php \nIf you are aware of any other senior facilities offering veggie food, please email vrg@vrg.org with the name of the facility. We\u2019d be happy to add more places to this list.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "vegetarian resource group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vrg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T16:00:56.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b9d71ee223f2124a149f4ce30c5a8075199357a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.RbhMprE3fuVLf6oTPyMMCPgUsedBDrxQZYgSzSX0b79sS616yQeqpE9nQN0X27BUfr_zVFMRIF_E2R_fsFfQ_gaVY32SYeMw7UEbdeoS.OhpfCZhnjligqLlG3PcrOD38Wji17Gdz8g--", "site_full": "www.vrg.org", "site": "vrg.org", "site_section": "http://www.vrg.org/blog", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The VRG Blog", "title": "HERE\u2019S ANOTHER WINNER OF THE VEGETARIAN RESOURCE GROUP 2017 VIDEO CONTEST", "title_full": "HERE\u2019S ANOTHER WINNER OF THE VEGETARIAN RESOURCE GROUP 2017 VIDEO CONTEST", "published": "2017-10-18T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b9d71ee223f2124a149f4ce30c5a8075199357a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.RbhMprE3fuVLf6oTPyMMCPgUsedBDrxQZYgSzSX0b79sS616yQeqpE9nQN0X27BUfr_zVFMRIF_E2R_fsFfQ_gaVY32SYeMw7UEbdeoS.OhpfCZhnjligqLlG3PcrOD38Wji17Gdz8g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The VRG Blog Editor", "published": "2017-10-18T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "HERE\u2019S ANOTHER WINNER OF THE VEGETARIAN RESOURCE GROUP 2017 VIDEO CONTEST", "text": "Aimee Granger stated, \u201cI am interested in vegetarianism for moral reasons, as I hope I\u2019ve explained in my video.\u201d\nSee: http://www.vrg.org/veg_videos.php#Granger \nThe deadline for the next video contest is July 15, 2018.

It is a color code. When you chose a paint at the store, the store will tint that paint to your desired color. The store will use a combination of colorants (think food dye), add them to the paint, and mix it up for you at the point of sale. We have several options and brands of paints that you could have tinted to SW 6738 color \u2026 SW 6738 is just the name of a color, it is not a product. \nAfter speaking to a suburban Maryland Sherwin-Williams salesperson we were told that (SW 6738 Vegan) Harmony Interior Acrylic Latex Paint (Product Code (PC) 650428188) needs five tints (all liquid in these cases) that must be blended and mixed in the paint:\nWhite PC 650349996\nNew Green PC 650349400\nRaw Umber PC 650349954\nYellow PC 650350002\nDeep Gold PC 650350010\nThe regulatory department at Sherwin Williams told us the above paint and tints (that could obtain the SW 6738 vegan color) does not contain carmine, cochineal, stearic acid, gelatin, whey, casein, or milk as intentionally added ingredients. Thank you to Sherwin Williams for all their help. \nBACKGROUND OF OUR RESEARCH\n2014 SW Q&A Exchange on Vegan Color\nIn 2014 The VRG had asked Sherwin-Williams if their Vegan tint was, in fact, vegan. At that time they would not say if there were any animal ingredients or not in the tint.\nHere is the 2014 exchange:\nVRG initial questions:\nIs this paint vegan (meaning it contains no animal products)? http://www.sherwin-williams.com/homeowners/color/find-and-explore-colors/paint-colors-by-family/SW6738-vegan/ \nAre your other paints free of animal ingredients?\nSW initial response:\nThe materials and formulations of our products are proprietary so I am unable to disclose the information you are looking for. What I can tell you is what you are referring to is only a color and not a type of paint.\nI hope this information is useful. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.\nVRG Followup Question #1: Can you tell me if there are animal-derived ingredients in this paint such as gelatin or casein?\nSW Followup Response #1: Again, I am sorry however the materials and formulations of our products are proprietary so I am unable to disclose specific information.\nPlease let me know if I can be of any further assistance. \nVRG Followup Question #2: I am not asking you to provide an ingredient list.\nI am asking if animal ingredients (such as gelatin or casein) are in the vegan paint\nSW Followup Response #2: Thank you very much for taking the time to follow up.\nAgain, I apologize for any inconvenience however I am unable to disclose the contents of our paint. This is proprietary information. You can find a list of ingredients that we are legally required to disclose on an MSDS. Simply provide the name of the product you are interested and I will send you this information.\nPlease let me know if I can be of any further assistance.\n[VRG Note: Since animal and dairy ingredients are not considered hazardous according to the government\u2019s definition, they are not required to be listed on a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) currently renamed \u201cSafety Data Sheets\u201d (SDS).]\n2017 SW Q&A Exchange on Vegan Color\nIn July 2017 we contacted Sherwin-Williams again with the same question when a long-time VRG volunteer asked us to look into it. \nCatherine in the Customer Service Department at Sherwin-Williams explained that SW 6738 is a color that can be added to many different types of paint that they sell such as latex paint. We clarified our question by requesting information on both the Vegan color and on the paints which it could be made in. We wanted to know if there were any animal- or dairy-derived ingredients in either.\nCatherine transferred us to the Regulatory Department at Sherwin-Williams (SWRD).\nSherwin-Williams Regulatory Department Responds\nThe next day after our initial call to Sherwin-Williams corporate office, we received a reply from the Regulatory Department (SWRD). Here is our initial email exchange with them when we were trying to determine how to get ingredient information from Sherwin-Williams. SWRD was extremely prompt in responding to our questions during this exchange often within minutes\nVRG: Does the color SW 6738 Vegan contain any animal ingredients?\nWhich paints could be tinted with SW 6738?\nOf those paints, which are free of all animal-derived ingredients?\nI do not need any MSDS unless it shows complete ingredient information.\nI am asking about animal ingredients and not about safety.\nSWRD: Thank you for reaching out to us. Our group can help you.\nHowever, we will need some more information.\nOur group can look up the formula for any tint base and to see if it contains animal-derived ingredients. We kindly ask that you supply us with the product numbers and/or UPC codes for the products you are interested in. If you need a recommendation, please reach out to customer service at 1-800-331-7979. Unfortunately we are not product experts here in Regulatory as we cover all SW brands and products, thousands. \nAdditionally, our group does not have the color formulas either. This information is handled by our SW stores. You would have to contact your local store to obtain the product IDs for the colorants that would be used to tint a base to the color of your choice. The colorants used may be different depending on the tint base.\nI apologize again that this question is not as easy to answer without more information.\nVRG: Could you please explain the difference between \u201ctint base\u201d and \u201ccolor\u201d? In your reply you present them as if they\u2019re different although I understand them to be synonyms.\nI assume that there is a tint that you add to a paint. Then you blend it in to make the entire gallon uniform in color. How are there two distinct formulas as you seem to suggest in your reply?\nIs SW 6738 a tint or a color?\nSWRD: Sorry for the confusion. The tint base is the uncolored paint in the can before it is tinted at the store for the customer. Small amounts of colorants are added at the point of sale at the store to achieve the customer-chosen color. We have the formulas for the base paint and the formulas for the colorants. What we don\u2019t know is which colorants are used and how much of them are used to achieve a specific color at the store level.\nSW 6738 is not a paint. It is a color code. When you chose a paint at the store, the store will tint that paint to your desired color. The store will use a combination of colorants (think food dye), add them to the paint, and mix it up for you at the point of sale. We have several options and brands of paints that you could have tinted to SW 6738 color. Unfortunately, I cannot make a paint recommendation for you. \nCustomer service can help answer your questions and make you a recommendation. They are the product experts. Please reach out to them at 1-800-331-7979.\nOnce you decide on a paint you would like tinted to SW 6738, please provide us a UPC code or product code for the paint(s) so we can look up the formula for you. Also, we do not know which colorants (dyes) the store will add to the paint to make it your desired color. Therefore, we will need to ask them for the product number for the colorants they are going to use.\nSW 6738 Vegan is just the name of a color, it is not a product. The colorants themselves are liquid but they typically have powders dispersed in them. \nVRG: Thanks for all of your great help!\nVRG: And now I can research tints, call a store and be given a list of colorants for the tints I select? Then I call you with that information and the name of a base paint?\nIs there any way you can scroll through colorants and select for \u201ccarmine\u201d for example? \nSWRD: Yes, I will need product numbers or UPC codes to be able to pull formulas. I will need the paint information as well as the colorant information. They all have separate formulas. Reviewing formulas is a manual process unfortunately, so I would be unable to scan a group of products for particular ingredients.\nSherwin-Williams Customer Support Department Responds:\nAfter sending in the website contact form, the Customer Support staff sent us an email. This is from an exchange of questions and answers.\nDenice at SW Followup Response: None of our paints contain animal ingredients. Also none of our colors contain animal ingredients. \nVRG: We spoke to Fred, a suburban Maryland Sherwin-Williams salesperson, for product code information. He was extremely helpful in providing all of the product code information for several paint types and for many colors including Vegan. He informed us that some of our paint choices would not support certain colors and suggested other paints that would. [VRG Tip: When looking to purchase vegan paint, we recommend that consumers specify both the paint and the tint for compatibility first; information on each taken separately is not useful.]\nAccording to Fred, SW 6738 Vegan in Harmony Interior Acrylic Latex Paint (Product Code (PC) 650428188), needs five tints (all liquid in these cases) that must be blended and mixed in the paint: \nWhite PC 650349996\nNew Green PC 650349400\nRaw Umber PC 650349954\nYellow PC 650350002\nDeep Gold PC 650350010\nSome Other Sherwin-Williams Colors and Paints: Carmine Present?\nKnowing that insect-derived carmine (cochineal) may be used to pigment red, pink, purple, yellow or orange tints in beverages but not knowing if this applies to paints, (although carmine is an ingredient in some craft paints, http://www.vrg.org/blog/2014/06/18/craft-glues-and-paints-mostly-petrochemical-but-carmine-present-in-some-testors-and-plaid-paints/ ), we asked about the product codes for all of the component tints needed to make these colors. \nFred did not have complete product code information at his store but he told us that ingredients are listed on certain bottles. For example, when we inquired about red, he stated that Sherwin-Williams has three red tints used to make many others. These are New Red, Magenta and Maroon. Fred read off ingredients from these bottles to us; carmine (cochineal) was not listed. Fred did not know if the ingredient lists on the bottles were complete so we asked the Regulatory Department about them as well. \nHere are some of the colors we asked about. We also selected several different combinations of paints and sheens but Fred was able to determine if certain tints and paints were compatible. Here are Fred\u2019s suggestions for some of the colors we wanted information about:\nSW 6840 Exuberant Pink which Fred told us can be made in Interior Emerald Flat Paint (PC 650869829), needs these four tints:\nWhite 650349996\nBlack 650349392\nMaroon 650349962\nMagenta 650349970\nSW 6565 Grandeur Plum in Interior Harmony Flat Paint (PC 650428188) also needs four tints blended together:\nRaw Umber 650349954\nBlack 650349392\nMaroon 650349962\nMagenta 650349970\nSW 6887 Navel in Interior ProMar 200 Zero VOC Flat Paint (PC 650186927) needs only two tints:\nWhite 650349996\nNew Red 650349988\nFinal Conclusions about Several SW Paints and Tints\nThe VRG in turn took these product codes to the Regulatory Department in September 2017. Here is that culminating exchange:\nVRG: I\u2019d like to know if any animal- or dairy-derived ingredients are in the paints and tints listed below.\nThese ingredients include:\ncarmine (also called cochineal)\nstearic acid (or similar chemical compounds)\ngelatin\nwhey\ncasein\nmilk \nHere are the paints followed by their product codes:\nInterior Emerald Flat: 650869829\nInterior Harmony Flat: 650428188\nInterior ProMar 200 Zero VOC Flat: 650186927\nHere are the tints and accompanying product codes:\nWhite 650349996\nNew Green 650349400\nRaw Umber 650349954\nYellow 650350002\nDeep Gold 650350010\nBlack 650349392\nMaroon 650349962\nMagenta 650349970\nNew Red 650349988\nSWRD response:\nThe following Sherwin-Williams products:\n650869829\n650428188\n650186927\n650349996\n650349400\n650349954\n650350002\n650350010\n650349392\n650349962\n650349970\n650349988\ndo not contain carmine, cochineal, stearic acid, gelatin, whey, casein or milk as intentionally added ingredients.\nThis information is to the best of my knowledge, based on current formulation and information given to us by our raw material suppliers.\nThank you to Sherwin Williams for all their help. \n[VRG Note: In a phone conversation, it was noted that sometimes Sherwin-Williams uses tint components from other vendors. These trademarked components appear on the Sherwin-William\u2019s ingredient labels that they accessed to answer our inquiry about animal- and dairy-derived ingredients. The raw material supplier s may not reveal, even to Sherwin-Williams, all of the contents of the trademarked components claiming it\u2019s proprietary information. This means that in cases where trademarked components are used we as consumers cannot know all ingredient source information.]\nThe contents of this posting, our website and our other publications, including The Vegetarian Journal, are not intended to provide personal medical advice.

She asked us to look into it.\nOur member told us that she often asks ingredient questions when dining out even after searching through restaurant websites for ingredient information and ingredient lists. She referred to Olive Garden\u2019s vegan list which contains the breadsticks in the top spot. https://media.olivegarden.com/images/site/ext/pdfs/olive-garden-veg-vegan_073117.pdf \nOur supporter found her Olive Garden server to be \u201ccourteous and helpful.\u201d She was surprised that, even without asking for it, her server volunteered the information that \u201cthe breadsticks have butter but can be ordered without it.\u201d\nThe VRG sent Olive Garden a message about this apparent contradiction on behalf of our member through the chain\u2019s website contact form. This is what we asked in August 2017:\n\u201cHello!\nI was at an Olive Garden restaurant and the server told me that the breadsticks had been cooked with butter.\nI see breadsticks listed on your vegetarian/vegan list as \u201cvegan.\u201d \nDo you use margarine to cook the breadsticks? Does the margarine have dairy in it (including whey)?\nCan I get just plain breadsticks without butter or margarine used to cook them?\nA Guest Relations Representative informed us during a phone call:\n\u201cIt was the server\u2019s mistake. There is no butter in the breadsticks. They are not cooked with butter or margarine. Margarine and garlic salt are added later. Diners can request that it not be added. Butter is never served with breadsticks.\u201d\nWe asked if any dairy ingredient such as whey or sodium caseinate were in the margarine. We also asked if there were any sugar in either the breadsticks or margarine. Lastly, we wanted to confirm that L-cysteine, a common dough conditioner that is often derived from human hair or poultry feathers, was not in the breadsticks. \nAfter their researching, we were told in an email: \u201cIn regards to our breadsticks, they do not contain whey, sodium caseinate, or sugar.\u201d\nWe were told in another phone call that \u201cThe breadsticks do not contain L-cysteine.\u201d\nAdditionally, we were told in emails that:\n\u201cMargarine that\u2019s brushed on top of the bread sticks does NOT contain dairy ingredients, whey, sodium caseinate, or any other form of caseinate such as potassium caseinate.\u201d\n\u201cMargarine brushed on top of bread sticks does not contain sugar ingredient.\u201d\nInterested vegetarians and vegans may be interested to read other relevant information that Olive Garden has arranged on a page especially devoted to answering common vegetarian and vegan questions: http://www.olivegarden.com/nutrition/vegetarian-and-vegan-options \nTo support The Vegetarian Resource Group research, donate at www.vrg.org/donate \nJoin The Vegetarian Resource Group at http://www.vrg.org/member/2013sv.php \nMore information on chain restaurants can be found at\nhttp://www.vrg.org/fastfoodinfo.php \nVegan and vegetarian restaurants in the USA and Canada can be found at\nhttp://www.vrg.org/restaurant/index.php \nThe contents of this posting, our website and our other publications, including Vegetarian Journal, are not intended to provide personal medical advice.

To join see: https://www.facebook.com/groups/VRGparentsandkids/ \n-VRG\u2019s Food Service Advisor, Nancy Berkoff, did a presentation in Fargo, North Dakota at a regional meeting of the National Association of College and University Food Services. Nancy also consulted for a company in Russia who is looking to increase the availability of plant-based milks in Moscow.\n-We continue to work with numerous High School and College interns in our Baltimore office including future vegan Registered Dietitians. VRG Nutrition Advisor Reed Mangels, PhD, RD, mentors those interns who are interested in pursuing a career in nutrition. VRG staff also works with students that are majoring in Journalism, Business, etc. Among their tasks are staffing VRG booths throughout the USA, preparing vegan meals for homeless individuals, reviewing new vegan products (someone has to do that tough job!), writing up entries for our online restaurant guide, reviewing scientific studies on vegan diets, plus so much more. These students are the future of the vegan movement and we should all be excited about what they will bring to the cause once they graduate.\n-VRG assisted media (print, web, radio, tv, etc.). The Associated Press interviewed VRG\u2019s Nutrition Advisor, Reed Mangels, PhD, RD, on vegan babies; Reed also updated information on veggie pregnancies on BabyCenter.com . Reed was quoted in an Issue of Consumer Reports in an article titled, \u201cHealthy Shopping Strategies for Vegans.\u201d A reporter from NACS Magazine interviewed VRG Co-Director Debra Wasserman for a trends column about how convenience stores can respond to the growth of consumers who are vegetarian and vegan. A Wall Street Journal writer contacted VRG for data on veganism/vegetarianism in the USA and how it compares to 20 years ago.\n\u2013 The Vegetarian Resource Group has done numerous outreach booths this year including Leg Up Farmers Market in York, PA; Farm Animal Rights Conference in VA; Charlottesville and Richmond, VA VegFests; Vegan SoulFest in Baltimore, MD; DC GreenFest; Veggie Pride Parade in NYC; DC VegFest; Ashville, NC VegFest; New England VegFest in Worcester, MA; Baltimore VegFest; Jain Conference in Edison, NJ; Western NY VegFest in Buffalo, NY; World VegFest in San Francisco, CA; New Jersey VegFest in Secaucus, NJ; and Central Pa VegFest in Lancaster, PA. We will soon be at the Annual Meeting of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics in Chicago, IL; Everett Community College Food Day in WA; and more locations.\n-The Vegetarian Resource Group provided vegan handouts free-of-charge for outreach in a wide variety of locations including 500 Save Our Water and 500 My Vegan Plates to Charleston Veggies & Vegans for outreach; 200 Vegan Diets in a Nutshell, 200 Vegan Teen brochures, 200 Vegan Pregnancy brochures, and 200 My Vegan Plates to Columbia, SC for an Affordable Vegan Foods Workshop; sent 300 My Vegan Plates, 300 Vegan Diets in a Nutshell, and 100 Spanish brochures to Kalamazoo Vegans for tabling; sent 200 handouts to Nutrition Services @ St. Joseph Mercy Oakland Hospital; Sent to Vegan Society of PEACE for tabling in Katy, TX: 600 Vegan Diet in a Nutshell, 300 Save our Water, 300 Vegan Nutrition for Teens, 600 Vegetarian Journals; sent 200 My Vegan Plates to Food Not Bombs DE; sent 200 My Vegan Plates, 74 Vegan Diets in a Nutshell and another 150 handouts to be handed out at The Gayton Kirk Church in Richmond, VA, etc.\nYour support is greatly appreciated!

Heather reported: A lot of the people who stopped by were individuals who were transitioning and needed advice. Other individuals were teachers who wanted resources/were looking for resources. The Vegetarian Resource Group My Vegan Plate handout was the most popular and many people seemed to enjoy it. A lot of people loved that we had materials available. One guy in particular liked us because we weren\u2019t a business trying to make a profit, rather handing out free resources to those who wanted information.

My switch to vegetarianism came as a surprise for everyone around me because I grew up in a culture where meat is served at every party. Although that may throw people off, I think that vegetarianism does not exclude any group. Anyone can be a vegetarian, so long as they want to. I decided to switch over to a vegetarian diet because of my love for animals. As a child, I would always point out animal cruelty-in the circus, food, etc. Along with not wanting to support animal cruelty, I decided to become a vegetarian because of my health. Many diseases, like high blood pressure, run in my family, so I want to prevent it while saving the animals. I don\u2019t see a difference between torturing a dog and torturing a chicken\u2013they are both god\u2019s wonderful creation. Therefore, I want to look out for animals that \u201cbelong\u201d to the meat industry in hopes that one day, I can make a difference. I hope that my video has shown a brief explanation to why I am a vegetarian. I enjoyed making it and I hope you enjoyed watching!
