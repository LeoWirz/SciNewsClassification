Despite Tamron's own website saying they service this lens, upon sending it in I get an email stating it's no longer repairable - discontinued. I sent it in for a calibration, since the edges were starting to have severe blurriness.\nSo setting my frustrations aside with that fiasco, can anyone recommend a replacement? I need this range for an upcoming trip. Is the Sigma 17-50 2.8 OS the best bang for the buck currently? I want something that will look sharp with the D7200's sensor.\nI hear the Sigma 18-35 1.8 is nice, but I don't want to shell out $800. For me, the 17-50 is typically a daytime lens, so sharpness is my main concern.\nWhat can you guys recommend? This will compliment a Tokina 11-16, 2 primes, and a 55-300VR.\nThanks!\nHave you considered the Sigma 17-70C 2.8-4? I've had mine going on 4 years. Works with the USB dock. Been waiting for Sigma to upgrade their 17-50 but no rumors so far.

I've been considering this, but would be curious to hear other's stories about their experiences.\nMy background: was taking a few photos here and there while traveling, and have gradually gotten more interested in photography.

I have tried to keep prices down to a point where people don't have to stop and think too hard about buying something -- they see something they like and will grab it. I'm not well known and I don't think people would pay a premium for my work.\nAt an Art Fair, the profit margin for selling just a print with mat in a bag would be much higher. However, setting up would require buying a tent, setting up a way to take payment online, getting fixtures to house prints, etc. Seems like a very large investment and could take a lot of time on weekends (less time to shoot!)

Selection.\n2. Merging tracked areas (only applicable if tracking was used).\nHow hard it is to solve these problems depends on what you took a picture of. Also tracking.\nUntracked with simple rocks/mountains is a piece of cake. Just use a smart selection tool to grab the foreground from your foreground exposure (since the simple edges are easily recognized by the software) and then copy and paste. Done.\nTracking makes it a little harder, especially since the rotation of the tracked exposure with respect to the RA axis makes it non-trivial to unrotate your sky exposure. I usually cut a corner here. I copy the earth exposure to the sky one as a new layer and then use the clone tool by copying over the rocks/mountains to the blurred areas from the sky exposure so there's no blurred foregrounds. Alternatively you can clone stars to fill in the blurred areas.\nThere's an even easier method, which is to overlay your foreground such that it completely blocks any blurring due to tracking (typically by moving the foreground up from where it originally was). To me, this is going too far away from reality, since the ground is \"higher\" than in life. Others go even further in their distorting reality, like pasting sky exposures taken at different times of year or even different locations! It is incredibly obvious once you recognize it. Very common trick by Instagram \"photographers.\"\nWith any type of trees, selection is much less trivial. There are two methods that I have tried that work. One is first aggressively stretching the foreground exposure to create a significant difference in brightness between the foreground and sky. Then use a brightness based selection method to select the foreground. Save this selection and then revert to the unstreched foreground exposure and reload it to grab the foreground. Copy and paste.\nAlternatively, you can use masks to achieve the same thing. A bit more complicated, but it works on the same underlying principle of using brightness/intensity of various colors to differentiate land and sky. This youtube tutorial does a good job of explaining... its a bit tedious to write out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6I9Q-b2pQc&t=537s\nAgain, if you use a tracker, merging with trees is even more of a pain. You'll have to find what works for you when it comes to filling in the blurred spaces. Careful use of the clone tool has been my preference, but then again I have not had any shots that I really feel happy with doing serious work on.\nFinally, the relative brightness/white balance of sky and foreground is your artistic choice. But those are all trivial to adjust once you've figured out the critical problem of selection and merging.\nIf you have examples, I can show you my workflow.\nEdit: Panoramas are an even harder problem that I am currently unable to solve. It seems like everyone in this forum recommends a panorama for astrophotography because of the superior light gathering ability... but the inconsistent and irreproducible distortion (infuriating) introduced by the generation of separate panoramas for foreground and sky have made it impossible for me to merge the two successfully!\n(Note: Mosaic mode gets rid of the stupid distortion introduced by panorama software)\nAnd not to mention the whole other can of worms introduced by stitching tracked sky exposures that happen to contain land... since the sky moves but land does not. It seems to drive most panorama software that i've used (hugin, microsoft ICE), nuts!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

But I would still grab the 16-50mm S lens to take advantage of all the AF and Samsung integration for video. Even the Android apps look helpful. All this should be value-add for clients needing video, and expand my capabilities, and the $2800 kit package seems a value, relatively speaking.
