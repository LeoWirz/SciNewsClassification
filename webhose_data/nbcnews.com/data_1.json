Chris Fuchs / NBC News While Giant in its first half-year financials reported double-digit sales growth in local currency for its private brand in Europe and the U.S., the company\u2019s revenue dropped by 7.4 percent to NT$26.9 billion (US$892 million) compared to the same period last year, according to a company news release in August .\nNet income before and after taxes were NT$1.65 billion (US$547.1 million) and NT$1.19 billion (US$394.6 million) respectively for the first six months, a drop of 29.5 percent compared to the same period last year.\nThe statement attributed profit loss chiefly to unfavorable currency exchange rates. Giant also said its company in China suffered adversely from a continued slump in the Chinese market and also from bike sharing there.\nBut in Europe, Giant\u2019s growth came primarily from hot-selling electric bicycles, while mountain and road bikes did well in the U.S., the financial report said. The U.S. market, according to Giant, has also responded favorably to its electric bikes, which many in the industry view as the next big thing in cycling.\nWorkers assemble Giant bikes at the company's headquarters in Taichung, Taiwan. Chris Fuchs / NBC News A company spokeswoman said around 30 percent of bicycles made by Giant today are for other companies.\nTu said she\u2019s also proud of a women\u2019s line of bikes she created for Giant in 2008 called \u201c Liv .\u201d The need became apparent, she said, after joining a cycling event across Taiwan. The quality of the women\u2019s bike she rode and the cycling outfit she wore made for a tough go, Tu said.\n\u201cSo I started to think why don\u2019t we have a decent bike for female[s] and why [do] I have to wear a man\u2019s clothes,\u201d she explained. \u201cThis is also not right.\u201d\nLiv has proven successful in many English-speaking countries, Tu said, including Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. It\u2019s also been a hit in France, she added. Total sales revenue for 2016 was over US$100 million, according to Tu.\nAt the age of 68, Tu herself has become an avid cyclist, riding everywhere every chance she gets, she said.\n\u201cFor 23 years, we were drifting up and down.\u201d \u201cThe reason I like to promote Liv is not because I want to sell more bicycles,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s because when I\u2019m riding the bicycle I feel so happy. And after I ride I feel more confident, and I feel more [in] control of everything.\u201d\nEven after being in the bike business for so long, Giant still surprises some analysts when they learn it\u2019s a company from Taiwan, Tu said.\nFor many Taiwanese Americans already in the know, Giant\u2019s success story is a bright spot and source of pride.\n\u201cThat makes me feel very honored,\u201d Tu said. \u201cBut [it] also reminds me I have to work harder, that Giant has to keep up the good work, that I shouldn\u2019t let them down.\u201d\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_39/2171831/giant_assembly_27338a120b1cc036f7f61a4a93caee4f.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_39/2171831/giant_assembly_27338a120b1cc036f7f61a4a93caee4f.nbcnews-ux-600-480.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/nbcasianamerica", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_39/2171836/giant_bike_share_70dd1af59af0182826269dff36a79fd1.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.jpg", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_39/2171836/giant_bike_share_70dd1af59af0182826269dff36a79fd1.nbcnews-ux-600-480.jpg", "http://www.giantcyclingworld.com/inc/news_detail.php?id=d0ee7b5a-015d-1000-b27b-0025b325c334", "http://www.instagram.com/nbcasianamerica", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_39/2171836/giant_bike_share_70dd1af59af0182826269dff36a79fd1.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg", "https://www.liv-cycling.com/us/", "http://www.twitter.com/nbcasianamerica", "http://taipei.youbike.com.tw/cht/index.php", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_39/2171831/giant_assembly_27338a120b1cc036f7f61a4a93caee4f.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youbike", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris fuchs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ye", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "giant", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nbc news while giant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc asian america on facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "french alps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taipei streets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taipei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taipei city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nanjing west road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhongshan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taichung", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:41:57.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7cc705d830229b545f7c6bff0df053c2fe3bba28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9i7Tq_O5OR_lKTntPDZxBD0Jjfg.vefuYRbkEtEGab2460jH132T7szwdreqGRQ5jcHacl.6bNlE8HxIKplvrz34aO4eym6v5jmnKVoW1qqiBea9wjERIi", "site_full": "www.nbcnews.com", "site": "nbcnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics", "site_categories": ["media", "television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Politics: Congress, Political Parties, National Security &amp; More - NBC News", "title": "Can Set Feuds Aside in Favor of a Healing Role?", "title_full": "Can Trump Set Feuds Aside in Favor of a Healing Role? - NBC News", "published": "2017-10-03T20:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.124, "main_image": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_40/2175331/171002-moment-silence-trump-white-hosue-mn-1450_773aeb189642e269dd454eb5f5bd45a7.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 478, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7cc705d830229b545f7c6bff0df053c2fe3bba28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9i7Tq_O5OR_lKTntPDZxBD0Jjfg.vefuYRbkEtEGab2460jH132T7szwdreqGRQ5jcHacl.6bNlE8HxIKplvrz34aO4eym6v5jmnKVoW1qqiBea9wjERIi", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Chuck Todd", "published": "2017-10-03T20:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can Set Feuds Aside in Favor of a Healing Role?", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s strengths as a politician include his ability to mercilessly attack his opponents, his devoted base of support, and his political branding and showmanship. But they don\u2019t include what his job will be over the next two days \u2014 his role as comforter-in-chief to devastated Puerto Rico and a Las Vegas that witnessed the deadliest mass shooting in American history.\nTrump arrives today at 11:45 am ET, where he will receive a briefing on the island\u2019s hurricane-relief efforts, meet with individuals impacted by the hurricane and visit with Puerto Rico\u2019s governor. Tomorrow, he heads to Las Vegas, where the death toll is at 59 individuals with another 500 injured .\nIn Trump\u2019s eight months as president, we've seen him react to tragedy to with varying degrees of success \u2014 the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (A+), visiting Texas and Florida after their hurricanes (B or a C), and responding to the violence in Charlottesville, Va. (F). But today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consoler-in-chief jobs might be his toughest yet.\nIn Puerto Rico, he\u2019s stepping into a place where his administration\u2019s handling of the hurricane-relief efforts has been criticized, and where he\u2019s already attacked San Juan\u2019s mayor. \u201cSuch poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help,\u201d he tweeted on Saturday . \u201cThey want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.\u201d\nAnd in Las Vegas, he\u2019ll be responding to an act \u2014 gun violence \u2014 that has never been one of his chief political concerns in a state \u2014 Nevada \u2014 that he lost to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.\nI won\u2019t back down (on terrorism) vs. Don\u2019t come around here no more (on gun violence) Responding to the mass shooting in Las Vegas, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that yesterday wasn\u2019t the time to discuss gun violence. \u201cI think today is more \u2026 a day of reflection, a day of mourning, a day of gratefulness for those that were saved. And I think that there will be, certainly, time for that policy discussion to take place, but that's not the place that we're in at this moment.\u201d\nBut contrast that response \u2014 as well as Trump\u2019s sole tweet on the mass killing (\u201cMy warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you!\u201d \u2014 with how Trump has IMMEDIATELY responded to terrorism committed in the name of Islam.\nAfter the December 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, Trump proposed his Muslim ban . \u201cUntil we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,\u201d he said.\nAfter the June 2016 violence in Orlando, he tweeted , \u201cAppreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!\u201d\nAnd after the June 2017 terrorist attack in London, Trump said , \u201cAt least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \u2018no reason to be alarmed!\u2019\u201d\nBreakdown \u2014 on Nevada\u2019s gun debate NBC\u2019s Benjy Sarlin : \u201cSunday's massacre in Las Vegas \u2014 the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history \u2014 shone a light on Nevada's close partisan divide that has for years made it a national flash point in the battle over gun rights. Both sides have poured millions of dollars into campaigns to restrict or loosen gun laws, efforts that have been spurred by high-profile shootings both in Nevada and around the country.\u201d\n\u201cOverall, the state's restrictions are relatively light. There are no permit requirements for purchasing handguns, rifles and shotguns, according to the National Rifle Association. Residents are allowed to carry guns openly throughout the state, a provision that attracted scrutiny when self-styled militia groups gathered in 2014 to support rancher Cliven Bundy's standoff with authorities. \u2018There is very little on the books,\u2019 said Robyn Thomas, executive director of the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun safety group.\u201d\nPlay\nFacebook Twitter Embed Las Vegas shooting: What we know about Stephen Paddock 2:55 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog Running down a dream: Democrats pursue gun control Meanwhile, NBC\u2019s Jonathan Allen looks at how the Democratic Party\u2019s long roster of possible 2020 candidates all called for gun control after the Las Vegas shooting.\n\u201cNot long ago, Democratic presidential hopefuls shied away from talking about gun control \u2014 or at least made sure to pepper their rhetoric with nods to the Second Amendment. Not anymore,\u201d Allen writes.\n\u201c\u2018We cannot simply throw up our hands or continue to justify the presence of weapons of war whose primary purpose is to kill the largest number of human beings in the shortest amount of time possible,\u2019 freshman Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said in a statement.\u201d\n\u201cSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who has urged fellow Democrats to advocate for gun control, tweeted that it's time for a national conversation about guns.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was hammered for sometimes voting with the gun lobby by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, said Americans should do \u2018everything we can\u2019 to stop gun violence.\u201d\nFree fallin\u2019 prospects to pass tax reform? On \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this past weekend, retiring Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., gave this warning on tax reform: \u201c[I]f it looks like to me, Chuck, we're adding one penny to the deficit, I am not going to be for it, okay?\u201d\nAnd yesterday, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., tweeted , \u201cThis is a GOP tax plan? Possibly 30% of middle class gets a tax hike? I hope the final details are better than this.\u201d\nRemember, if tax reform turns into a party-line vote in the Senate, Republicans can\u2019t afford more than two defections, and already you\u2019re seeing Senate GOP opposition on the cost (Corker\u2019s concern) and the possibility of a tax increase on the middle class (Paul\u2019s concern).\nInto the great wide open (of an inspector general investigation) \u201cThe inspector general for the Interior Department has opened an investigation into Secretary Ryan Zinke\u2019s travel during seven months in office, from his use of taxpayer-funded charter and military planes to his mixing of official trips with political appearances,\u201d the Washington Post writes .\n\u201cNancy K.

Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 updated the death toll to 34.\nThe relief efforts have come at a cost, Trump pointed out to local officials at the briefing, saying that the disaster has \"thrown our budget a little out of whack\" but adding that it's worth it for all of the lives saved.\nThe president also called out FEMA Administrator Brock Long, grading him \"A+\" for recent relief efforts in Texas and Florida. \"Brock has been unbelievable,\" Trump said.\nBut, Trump added, Puerto Rico's recovery \"has been the toughest one.\"\nTrump pointed out the strength of the hurricane that hit the island \u2014 \"a Category Five, which few people have ever even heard of\" that he said \"hit land and, boy, did it hit land.\"\nPlay\nFacebook Twitter Embed Trump: We've Done 'A Great Job' In Puerto Rico 0:54 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog Residents, many of whom have been without water, electricity, housing and basic necessities, told NBC News ahead of Trump\u2019s arrival that he has been late in coming and that the federal government\u2019s response has been slow.\nOver several stops on Tuesday, Trump took part in handing supplies out to Puerto Ricans in need and even walked door to door in one residential neighborhood outside San Juan, greeting families who were outside their homes.

Jonathan Ernst / Reuters While the president has lauded first responders in Puerto Rico throughout the crisis, he has also lashed out at local leaders, including Cruz, who has criticized the government\u2019s response and made public pleas to Trump to send more help.\nOver the weekend, Trump accused Cruz of \"such poor leadership\" and partisan-motivated attacks against him as he charged that some in Puerto Rico want \"everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.\" In later tweets, he accused \"politically motivated ingrates\" and \"fake news\" of not recognizing the \"amazing work\" that the federal government has done so far in Puerto Rico.\nDeparting the White House earlier Tuesday, the president insisted recovery efforts were as good as those in Florida and Texas despite the \"tougher situation.\"\nWhile the administration has mobilized federal efforts to help, there has been widespread criticism about the speed and execution of government recovery efforts in Puerto Rico \u2014 with some even likening the situation to New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina under President George W.

From his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, just across the street, Paddock had an unobstructed perch and was able to look down as he fired bullets in rapid-fire succession on panicked concertgoers. \nRelated: Gunman Turned Las Vegas Concert Into 'World War III' \nPaddock had 23 firearms in his hotel room and police said they found 19 more \u2014 along with explosives and thousands of bullets \u2014 at his home in Mesquite, Nevada, northeast of Las Vegas. The guns appeared to have been purchased legally . \nThe search of the Mesquite home didn't immediately turn up notes, emails or social media postings pointing to a motive. Police also descended on a second home Paddock owned in Reno. \nThe shooter's family said he once managed and owned apartment buildings, gambled heavily and went to shows in Vegas. \n\"No affiliation, no religion, no politics.

Sponsored by Scientists Foresee Fixes Even for Complicated Forms of Blindness Share this \u2014 Scientists Foresee Fixes Even for Complicated Forms of Blindness Retinal problems may yield to advances in regeneration, gene editing, transplantation \u2014 and bionic eyes. by Daisy Yuhas / Oct.05.2017 / 7:24 PM ET Editor\u2019s note : NBC News MACH has partnered with the American Museum of Natural History to present three documentary films at the annual Margaret Mead Film Festival, which will be held in New York City from Oct. 19-22. In \"Lust for Sight,\" filmmaker Manuel von Sturler documents his own experience with macular degeneration. The film led us to examine new treatments for this and other conditions that cause vision loss. Science has made great strides in reversing vision-limiting problems in the front of the eye \u2014 for example, removing cataracts and replacing scarred corneas . Effective treatments for macular degeneration and other problems that affect the delicate light-sensitive retina at the back of the eye have proven to be much more elusive. But things may be looking up for the tens of millions of people around the world who suffer from retinal problems. Scientists are exploring new approaches to limit vision loss and even restore vision in these individuals, making use of advances in engineering, neuroscience, and genetics. The latest results suggest that retinal blindness may become a much more treatable condition sooner than anyone had imagined. \u201cGiven the relatively fast pace of clinical research, it is quite possible that within our lifetime, treatments will become readily available to patients as common cures,\u201d Dr. Stephen Tsang, a Columbia University ophthalmologist, said in a reference to stem cell research in particular. Multiple approaches Though the techniques may sound futuristic, the research is already starting to pay off. Bionic devices are now restoring partial vision to people who have lived for years without it. Regenerative medicine experts have shown that it's possible to grow specific types of cells involved in vision \u2014 and, perhaps one day, entire eyes. And powerful new gene-splicing techniques could soon correct vision-destroying hereditary conditions. Some of the most exciting breakthroughs are occurring at the cellular level, with scientists exploring regenerative therapies that coax the eye to heal itself. Image of the human retina. UHB Trust / Getty Images \u201cThe eye is one of these places where biologists have been studying regeneration for hundreds of years,\u201d says University of Washington biologist Dr. Thomas Reh. In particular, scientists have studied fish and amphibians, whose eyes (along with limbs and tails) regenerate after injury or loss. The thinking has been that if fish and amphibians can do it, maybe humans can too. And that hunch may prove to be correct. In August, Reh and his team reported a major milestone: regenerating retinal cells in mice , the first such success in adult mammals. The new cells not only \u201cwired in correctly\" but also appeared to function normally. \u201cTheir light responses looked surprisingly normal,\u201d Reh says. Reh\u2019s approach isn't yet ready for human experiments, but other regenerative techniques are. Genes to the rescue Last March, a Japanese team published encouraging results from an experimental procedure in which a woman with macular degeneration was given transplants of stem cells derived from cells from her own skin. Immediately after surgery, she reported that her long-dimmed vision had become brighter. A year later, the new cells were intact and the improvement in her vision remained. Gene therapies could augment these efforts. At Columbia University, Tsang has collected cells from patients with a hereditary retinal disease and then used genetic engineering techniques to correct the mutations that underlie it. Related These Unbelievably Tiny Tags Promise Big Advances in Medical Care The advent of powerful gene-editing tools like CRISPR , which can snip away faulty DNA and replace it with desired genetic material, could expand the reach of his work. Other scientists are focusing exclusively on gene therapy. A team at Johns Hopkins University, for example, is treating macular degeneration patients with the help of viruses that implant genes coding for proteins that block the progression of retinal damage. Similar techniques might be used to prevent vision loss before it begins. Bionic eyes Dr. Jos\u00e9-Alain Sahel, an ophthalmologist who leads teams at the University of Pittsburgh and the Vision Institute in Paris, is trying to grow a functioning optic nerve. That's the tract of nerve fibers that transports visual messages to and connects the back of the eye with the brain. And a consortium of scientists at the University of Pittsburgh, Harvard University, and the University of California, San Diego is focused on the ambitious goal of transplanting an entire human eye . Their plan calls for a combination of surgical and regenerative techniques: doctors would transplant the eye from a donor into the patient and then coax the optic nerve to make connections to the brain. Meanwhile, bionic eyes like the Argus II \u2014 the only such device with FDA approval \u2014 are already changing lives. Specifically designed for people with a form of retinal degeneration known as retinitis pigmentosa, the Argus II restores limited vision via a tiny array of electrodes implanted at the back of the eye. Subscribe Let our news meet your inbox. SIGN UP Bionic eyes such as the Argus II rely on a tiny implant embedded on the retina. Second Sight Worldwide, more than 225 people with retinitis pigmentosa have been fitted with the Argus II. Users wear glasses that incorporate a tiny camera to collect visual information, which is then relayed to a box-like processor worn on the belt. The processor communicates wirelessly with the electrodes. The implant lets users see patterns of light flashes, an effect that's been likened to an old-fashioned scoreboard in which bulbs turn on and off to form numbers and letters. It typically takes months of training before users can interpret the flashes, but eventually they're able to recognize objects \u2014 and the faces of loved ones. It can be a very emotional experience for people who might have spent years in darkness. As Will McGuire, CEO of the Sylmar, California-based company that makes the Argus II, puts it, \u201cPatients can see the outline of their grandchildren or see a spouse for the first time in 10 years.\u201d FOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER , FACEBOOK , AND INSTAGRAM .

Asked about renewed pleas from lawmakers for stricter gun control measures, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it was \"premature\" to talk about potential legislation before all the facts about the Las Vegas mass shooting are known.\u201d \nNBC\u2019s Benjy Sarlin on why Nevada is so central to the gun debate: \u201cSunday's massacre in Las Vegas \u2014 the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history \u2014 shone a light on Nevada's close partisan divide that has for years made it a national flash point in the battle over gun rights. Both sides have poured millions of dollars into campaigns to restrict or loosen gun laws, efforts that have been spurred by high-profile shootings both in Nevada and around the country. Overall, the state's restrictions are relatively light. There are no permit requirements for purchasing handguns, rifles and shotguns, according to the National Rifle Association. Residents are allowed to carry guns openly throughout the state, a provision that attracted scrutiny when self-styled militia groups gathered in 2014 to support rancher Cliven Bundy's standoff with authorities.\u201d \nAnd here\u2019s NBC\u2019s Alex Seitz-Wald over what\u2019s next for gun legislation in Congress. \nHere\u2019s the latest reporting from our team on the shooter , his guns and how he was able to create such devastation. \nThe New York Times , on Trump\u2019s response: \u201cThe week will pose the greatest test yet of whether a president who plays to America\u2019s divisions can also appeal to its sense of national unity, whether it is binding the wounds left by a rampaging gunman or the wreckage left by a deadly hurricane. Whether Mr. Trump can sustain his empathetic tone over what promise to be two emotional, exhausting days also is an open question \u2014 particularly as critics attack his position on gun laws, or if he faces further criticism from local officials in Puerto Rico over the slow-to-start relief effort there. On Monday afternoon, some of the president\u2019s aides were urging him to put off the trip to Puerto Rico because they worried that he could be set off by protests.\u201d \nPuerto Ricans are hoping that Trump gets an accurate picture of the devastation on the island when he visits today. \nThe Washington Post: \u201cRussian operatives set up an array of misleading Web sites and social media pages to identify American voters susceptible to propaganda, then used a powerful Facebook tool to repeatedly send them messages designed to influence their political behavior, say people familiar with the investigation into foreign meddling in the U.S. election. The tactic resembles what American businesses and political campaigns have been doing in recent years to deliver messages to potentially interested people online.

But they don\u2019t include what his job will be over the next two days \u2014 his role as comforter-in-chief to devastated Puerto Rico and a Las Vegas that witnessed the deadliest mass shooting in American history. \nTrump arrives today in San Juan, Puerto Rico at 11:45 am ET, where he will receive a briefing on the island\u2019s hurricane-relief efforts, meet with individuals impacted by the hurricane and visit with Puerto Rico\u2019s governor. Tomorrow, he heads to Las Vegas, where the death toll is at 59 individuals with another 500 injured . \nIn Trump\u2019s eight months as president, we've seen him react to tragedy to with varying degrees of success \u2014 the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (A+), visiting Texas and Florida after their hurricanes (B or a C), and responding to the violence in Charlottesville, Va. (F). But today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consoler-in-chief jobs might be his toughest yet. \nIn Puerto Rico, he\u2019s stepping into a place where his administration\u2019s handling of the hurricane-relief efforts has been criticized, and where he\u2019s already attacked San Juan\u2019s mayor. \u201cSuch poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help,\u201d he tweeted on Saturday . \u201cThey want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.\u201d \nAnd in Las Vegas, he\u2019ll be responding to an act \u2014 gun violence \u2014 that has never been one of his chief political concerns in a state \u2014 Nevada \u2014 that he lost to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election. I won\u2019t back down (on terrorism) vs. Don\u2019t come around here no more (on gun violence) \nResponding to the mass shooting in Las Vegas, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that yesterday wasn\u2019t the time to discuss gun violence. \u201cI think today is more \u2026 a day of reflection, a day of mourning, a day of gratefulness for those that were saved. And I think that there will be, certainly, time for that policy discussion to take place, but that's not the place that we're in at this moment.\u201d \nBut contrast that response \u2014 as well as Trump\u2019s sole tweet on the mass killing (\u201cMy warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you!\u201d \u2014 with how Trump has IMMEDIATELY responded to terrorism committed in the name of Islam. \nAfter the December 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, Trump proposed his Muslim ban . \u201cUntil we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,\u201d he said. \nAfter the June 2016 violence in Orlando, he tweeted , \u201cAppreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!\u201d \nAnd after the June 2017 terrorist attack in London, Trump said , \u201cAt least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \u2018no reason to be alarmed!\u2019\u201d Breakdown \u2014 on Nevada\u2019s gun debate \nNBC\u2019s Benjy Sarlin : \u201cSunday's massacre in Las Vegas \u2014 the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history \u2014 shone a light on Nevada's close partisan divide that has for years made it a national flash point in the battle over gun rights. Both sides have poured millions of dollars into campaigns to restrict or loosen gun laws, efforts that have been spurred by high-profile shootings both in Nevada and around the country.\u201d \n\u201cOverall, the state's restrictions are relatively light. There are no permit requirements for purchasing handguns, rifles and shotguns, according to the National Rifle Association. Residents are allowed to carry guns openly throughout the state, a provision that attracted scrutiny when self-styled militia groups gathered in 2014 to support rancher Cliven Bundy's standoff with authorities. \u2018There is very little on the books,\u2019 said Robyn Thomas, executive director of the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun safety group.\u201d Play ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chuck todd", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "mark mu", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "steve scalise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cliven bundy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah huckabee sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robyn thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carrie dann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjy sarlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nbc news oct", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "national rifle association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "law center to prevent gun violence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "play can trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meet the press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc political unit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san bernardino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "va.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlottesville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jihad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:06:46.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a63badff5947e5cd0feef620fe850376e31775c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR93qbSsuKmhHiLKTqP7yZwOTbJ.vhNzaBkHRmkj0job5PyBbvDIZc73xecC6eCHjDTO1CPuxiOONexPYhHcT5sT3ga1tyueAIEIIfCfUhDwgvcmXdSy5WDa3IiD_cYXEQ-", "site_full": "www.nbcnews.com", "site": "nbcnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "Gravitational Wave Works Wins Physics Nobel Prize - NBC News", "title_full": "Gravitational Wave Works Wins Physics Nobel Prize - NBC News", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.024, "main_image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_40/2176146/171003-kip-thorne-nobel-physics-njs-740a_40b4bda3bd2702c28ce994420ebb1517.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 478, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1198, "comments": 0, "shares": 1198}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 25}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a63badff5947e5cd0feef620fe850376e31775c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR93qbSsuKmhHiLKTqP7yZwOTbJ.vhNzaBkHRmkj0job5PyBbvDIZc73xecC6eCHjDTO1CPuxiOONexPYhHcT5sT3ga1tyueAIEIIfCfUhDwgvcmXdSy5WDa3IiD_cYXEQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Maggie Fox", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Gravitational Wave Works Wins Physics Nobel Prize - NBC News", "text": "Oct 3 2017, 10:19 pm ET Gravitational Wave Work Wins Physics Nobel Prize by Maggie Fox advertisement \nThree U.S. physicists won the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for their work that led to the detection of gravitational waves \u2014 the ripples in space-time made when black holes collide and when other big cosmic events happen. \nKip Thorne and Barry Barish of the California Institute of Technology and Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology split the $1 million prize, awarded for their work in designing and developing the detectors that proved the waves exist. The world's first captured gravitational waves were created in a violent collision between two black holes, 1.3 billion light years away. When these waves passed the Earth they had weakened considerably: the disturbance in spacetime that LIGO measured was thousands of times smaller than an atomic nucleus. Nobel Prize \n\u201cThis year\u2019s prize is about a discovery that shook the world,\u201d the Nobel committee\u2019s G\u00f6ran Hansson said in making the announcement. \nKip Thorne, 77, may be one of the best-known names in science. The Caltech physicist has written several popular books that have made arcane ideas such as wormholes, time travel and gravity understandable to nonscientists. \nRelated: Collision Shook Space-Time \nIt was his work on gravitational waves that got him a share of the Nobel, considered the premier prize in science. The Nobel Committee specifically named their work on LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. \n\u201cPioneers Rainer Weiss and Kip S. Thorne, together with Barry C. Barish, the scientist and leader who brought the project to completion, have ensured that more than four decades of effort led to gravitational waves finally being observed,\u201d the committee said in its announcement. The collision of two black holes holes--a tremendously powerful event detected for the first time ever by LIGO--is seen in this still from a computer simulation. Caltech / MIT/LIGO Laboratory \n\u201cThe 2017 Nobel Laureates have, with their enthusiasm and determination, each been invaluable to the success of LIGO,\u201d it added. \nThe Berlin-born Weiss, 85, gets half the prize. Thorne and Barish, 81, split the other half. \n\u201cLIGO is no ordinary telescope for detecting light and other electromagnetic radiation from space. It is an instrument for listening to space\u2019s gravitational waves; even if gravitational waves are tremors in spacetime itself, and not sound waves, their frequency is equivalent to those we can hear with our human ears,\u201d the committee said.

A view of Raqqa's Old City destroyed during a battle with ISIS militants in Syria. Erik De Castro / Reuters \nIn July Iraqi security forces drove ISIS out of Mosul, and in recent weeks U.S.-backed forces have closed in on the Syrian city of Raqqa \u2014 the so-called capital of the group's self-declared caliphate. \nAs ISIS forces retreat in Syria and Iraq, they also lose oil reserves, a key source of income for the group. \u201cThey\u2019re losing their ability to self-fund, which made them unique,\u201d Vincent said. \nDuncan Gardham, NBC News security analyst, agreed that the group's spike in claims of responsibility over the past year was indicative of its \u201cincreasing desperation.\u201d \n\u201cThey\u2019re losing the caliphate \u2026 but they still want to appear strong,\u201d he said, adding that ISIS was concentrating on its image in the West rather than developments in Iraq and Syria. \n\"The story there is not good,\" he said, adding, \"They always used attacks in the West as a tactic, but it may now be their only tactic.\u201d \nRelated: Why Nevada is Nation's Flashpoint on Politics and Guns \nBut by publishing these apparent false-claims of responsibility, ISIS is unknowingly undermining its credibility in the West, Gardham said. \n\u201cThey don\u2019t really understand that they are devaluing the claims they make because people don\u2019t take them seriously anymore,\" Gardham said. \u201cIt\u2019s a deeply flawed strategy.\u201d \nVincent agreed. \u201cThey\u2019re becoming a laughing stock when they make these sort of outrageous claims,\u201d he said. \u201cIt greatly harms their international reputation.\u201d \nBut Shiraz Maher, deputy director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence at King\u2019s College London, questioned whether the claims were indicative of a weakening ISIS. \nMaher said the group was seeking to capitalize on the attack by publishing disinformation, spreading more panic and possibly hindering the investigation \u2014 as well as making a bid to inspire troops. \n\u201cIn a sense it doesn\u2019t matter if ISIS lies about this \u2014 their supporters will see it as a victory,\u201d he said, adding that some followers would never believe what the FBI had to say. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a form of psychological warfare,\u201d he added.

Menendez Takes the Stand", "text": "Oct 3 2017, 10:42 am ET High Risk, and Drama, if Sen. Menendez Testifies at His Bribery Trial by Danny Cevallos advertisement \nSen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., is on trial in U.S. District Court in Newark, charged in a bribery scheme in which he allegedly accepted gifts from a Florida eye doctor in exchange for using his Senate office to benefit the doctor's financial and personal interests. \nThe month-long trial resumed Monday and could last several more weeks. Soon, the senator and his legal team will have to make the same critical decision every criminal defendant must make at trial: whether to testify or remain silent. \nA defendant has the constitutional right not to testify or present any evidence. Neither the court nor the prosecutor may even comment on a defendant's decision to remain silent, and the jury is not supposed to take it into account during deliberations. \nIn addition, a defendant like Menendez has the benefit of the presumption of innocence, giving the prosecution the highest burden of proof in the law: It must establish each element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. That's why a defense can present no evidence, snipe at the prosecutor's evidence and simply point at the prosecution's failure to meet this burden. \nOn the other hand, these considerable constitutional and procedural protections can't neutralize human nature: Jurors naturally want to hear an accused person take the stand and deny the terrible things being said. Prosecutor Peter Koski delivers the government's opening statement in the trial of Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., in Newark Art Lien \nSo, will Menendez's team have him take the stand? One of his attorneys, Abbe Lowell, said recently that it's possible, but he gave no definitive answer. \nJoseph DiRuzzo, a criminal defense lawyer with experience handling federal bribery and fraud cases in the circuit where Menendez is being prosecuted, said: \"Generally, if a case can be defended without having the defendant testify, then the defendant should not take the stand.: \nThere are exceptions, DiRuzzo said. \"Sometimes the defendant is the only source of a defense theory because there are no corroborating witnesses.\" \nOne example is self-defense. If no one saw the incident, the only way to establish that the force used by a defendant was in response to an immediate threat is usually through the defendant's own words. \nMenendez, who has denied all charges, is accused of using his office to influence business disputes worth tens of millions of dollars to the eye doctor, Salomon Melgen, and of supporting the visa applications of several of Melgen's girlfriends. In exchange, Menendez allegedly accepted flights on Melgen's private jet, first-class vacations in the Dominican Republic and Paris, and more than $750,000 in campaign contributions. Dr. Salomon Melgen arrives April 2 at U.S. District Court in Newark, New Jersey. Eduardo Munoz / Reuters \nPerhaps Menendez is the only person who can explain why those weren't corrupt transactions. But if he takes the stand and his explanation isn't credible, then he will look as if he's lying \u2014 and to a jury, that's worse than not testifying at all. \nThe senator is a lawyer and a sophisticated public speaker, so perhaps he would hold his own on the stand. But testifying isn't a fair debate with the U.S. attorney. The rules are slanted against the witness. \nThe witness must answer the questions as posed, and the prosecutor can ask leading questions \u2014 essentially making a damaging statement of fact and forcing the witness to answer yes or no. Unless Menendez's testimony is the only way to refute facts, he probably shouldn't testify. \nIn bribery cases, so much other shady behavior is often involved that even the most brilliant witness can look guilty. Evidence of all the luxuries an official received from a wealthy citizen often sours the regular folks on a jury against the defendant. \nIf Menendez chooses not to testify, the judge will instruct jurors that they can't consider, for any reason at all, the fact that he didn't speak in his own defense. They can't even discuss his silence during their deliberations. \nBut jurors still want to hear from a defendant. All the instructions in the world sometimes don't change that. \nDanny Cevallos is a legal analyst for NBC News.

But they do show that there were multiple transactions. \nPaddock had \"the highest status\" at Caesars Entertainment properties in Las Vegas, a source close to the investigation told NBC News. \nThe top level for gamblers is Seven Stars Tier Status, which is by invitation only and subject to alteration or cancellation, according to the company's website. Privileges include complimentary rooms, room upgrades, player credits and access to \"signature experiences.\" \nBut Paddock gambled and lost in 2012 when he filed a slip-and-fall lawsuit against another Las Vegas casino, the Cosmopolitan Hotel. In fact, he still owed $270 in court fees when he killed himself and 58 other people on Sunday. Authorities said Tuesday night that the widely reported number of 59 deaths includes the gunman.

He claimed he slipped in a puddle of liquid and initially sued for $100,000, according to the attorney for the hotel, Marty Kravitz. \nPaddock claimed he had incurred more than in $32,000 in medical bills and also wanted to be paid for pain and suffering. The security video showed him getting medical attention and then being stretchered out of the casino. \nThe arbitrator disagreed and ruled in favor of the casino, dismissing the negligence allegations as \"without merit.\" \nRelated: What We Know So Far About the Victims in Las Vegas \n\"They always ask for a lot more than they can get, but he got nothing,\" Kravitz said. \nIn other developments, investigators have also found a sledgehammer and 13 suitcases in the 32nd-floor room in the Mandalay Bay hotel that Paddock used to stage the slaughter, according to an internal law enforcement document seen by NBC News and senior law enforcement officials. \nThey believe Paddock used the tool to smash the two windows from which he opened fire on the concertgoers below with the arsenal of 23 firearms that was also found in the room. Another cache of 19 firearms was found in Paddock's home in Mesquite, Nevada. Marilou Danley is being sought by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department for questioning in connection with the investigation into the active shooter incident in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, 2017 LVMPD \nNBC reported earlier that police blew the door off Paddock's room and barged inside 72 minutes after the first 911 call . Inside, they found Paddock dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, but not Danley. \nLombardo credited local police and hotel security with the speed in which they reacted. \n\"What went right is we saved hundreds of lives,\" he said. \"A lot more [deaths] were prevented.\" \nAsked whether housekeeping had been allowed into the room at any point while Paddock was there, Lombardo said, \"The only thing I know is room service was provided.\" \nInvestigators do not believe Danley was involved in the shooting, although Paddock did have some of her identification on him, law enforcement officials have said. \nInvestigators still have not determined a motive . The death toll stands at 59, but officials have warned that it could climb. More than 500 people were wounded. \n\"We have identified all but three victims,\" Lombardo said. \nCORRECTION (Oct. 3, 2017, 5:35 p.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the resolution of a 2012 court case involving Stephen Paddock.

The clothes\u2019 raw materials were imported from around the world. The clothing line created special edition collections commemorating Fat Albert and sports icon Muhammad Ali. Its record label, FUBU Records, released a gold-selling compilation in 2001 with Universal Records. Subsequent investments include a radio station, television network, fragrances, bedding, formal wear, personal care products, a NASCAR-BUSCH sponsorship and luxury hotels.\nHip-hop moguls like P. Diddy, Nelly and Jay-Z borrowed John\u2019s template to develop their own successful clothing companies. The man behind branding and marketing entity The Shark Group is humbled to witness those artists\u2019 evolution into cultural icons.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the middle of doing something, you don\u2019t realize the effect it may have with people,\u201d shared John. \u201cI had much bigger hope for FUBU. Ralph Lauren probably does about $3 to $4 billion a year still. I did $6 billion over 20 years. When anybody touches any extension of anything that you do, you should be extremely grateful.\u201d\nPre-FUBU, John was no stranger to entrepreneurship. The results-oriented Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship appointed by former President Barack Obama owned six businesses, including a delivery service. Prior to judging a pitch competition, Miller Lite\u2019s Tap the Future, in Atlanta, the best-selling author of \u201cDisplay of Power,\u201d \u201cThe Brand Within\u201d and \u201cThe Power of Broke\u201d shared some of his eye-opening realizations with NBC News that signaled FUBU\u2019s growth.\nA photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews)\nIt\u2019s the same pearls of wisdom, or \u201cShark Tools,\u201d the businessman and brand strategist offers to budding entrepreneurs he mentors and Fortune 500 companies he consults. \u201cIt\u2019s about setting up a structure and making sure that all legal is in place,\u201d said John. \u201cYou have to know about trademarks and patents. Money is not going to really help you; it\u2019s your ability to solve problems, create a team and build a genuine following that can help you.\u201d\nRelated: How This 11-Year-Old Turned Something Scary Into Something Sweet\nJohn, a thyroid cancer survivor, continues: \u201cBeing a boss is not somebody who comes in late, leaves early and fires everybody. You generally come in before everybody and leave after everybody. The buck stops with you, but it\u2019s a great process: a process you constantly have to learn. You don\u2019t get to a certain level and stop.\u201d\nIn the early 2000s, FUBU\u2019s visibility began to diminish. The recession later that decade caused FUBU to further tank. Still, FUBU\u2019s name never went anywhere.\nDaymond John at the Miller Lite Tap the Future event. Courtesy of MillerCoors FUBU was recently revamped online through partnerships with Urban Outfitters and Ebbet Field Flannels. The retailers carry limited edition capsule collections of FUBU\u2019s original designs and sports jerseys. In Brooklyn, FUBU has opened six mobile stores. Grammy-winning entertainer Chris Brown took photos on-stage wearing a basic FUBU tee.\nReintroducing FUBU to a younger audience, John said, stemmed from noticing an influx of customers purchasing the past collections on eBay. \u201cReinvention is always going out, knowing who you are, what your brand is and finding an audience that resonates with it,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt\u2019s the customer first. Some kids will not even know FUBU from what it was 20 years ago. They\u2019ll just know it from getting on a phone with a whole bunch of content on it sensitive to what they like. It has to stay true to the brand. People have to demand it more than we\u2019re trying to push it.\u201d\nA photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews)\nThese days, John is far from recreating another FUBU. The venture capitalist contributes to causes like donating mattresses and serving breakfast at homeless shelters. In February, he built a 17,000-square-foot member-based creative incubator, Blueprint + co, in New York City. \u201cShark Tank\u201d is in its eighth season. He also invested in a barbecue restaurant and companies that produce novelty eyeglasses, bow ties and belts.\nRelated: Muktar Onifade: General Motors Engineer Serves Street Swag\nJohn is grateful for FUBU allowing him to solidify a legacy by helping others fulfill their entrepreneurial aspirations. \u201cI\u2019m obviously a little more mature than when I was younger,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that time, I was working so hard on my first name. Now, I work so hard on what my last name will leave.\u201d\nFollow NBCBLK on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/nbcblk/", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_37/2150461/170911-fubu25-2-blk-0953a_f89315e2f327f417b914a17737fc24c1.nbcnews-ux-600-480.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_37/2150461/170911-fubu25-2-blk-0953a_f89315e2f327f417b914a17737fc24c1.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.jpg", "https://twitter.com/NBCBLK", "https://instagram.com/p/BVQm3WaFcfw/", "https://www.facebook.com/nbcblk", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_37/2150461/170911-fubu25-2-blk-0953a_f89315e2f327f417b914a17737fc24c1.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg", "https://instagram.com/p/BYlLhbyBfTS/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daymond john", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muktar onifade", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miller lite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay-z", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammad ali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "p. diddy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph lauren", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nbc news fubu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "universal records", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fubu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "millercoors fubu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shark group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fubu records", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ebay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:53:28.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "251878bee34bf5540cc3be469051454bc89e00b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9i7Tq_O5OR_lKTntPDZxBD0Jjfg.vefuZ9G7oxM2LZozku8Z25yPPFr_RWX4uvO9qpgPfLA_ClIOy1luQblZYXekrUha9i2O2KbB89888jVrb_T2akKD4AvZBLdhr41NsSOsS1ue90.w--", "site_full": "www.nbcnews.com", "site": "nbcnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics", "site_categories": ["media", "television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Politics: Congress, Political Parties, National Security &amp; More - NBC News", "title": "U.S. to Expel 15 Officials From Cuban Embassy Over Havana Attacks - NBC News", "title_full": "U.S. to Expel 15 Officials From Cuban Embassy Over Havana Attacks - NBC News", "published": "2017-10-04T01:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_40/2176391/171003-cuba-embassy-washington-dc-ew-1134a_961f50fdc5403cf1705c7c32fb5a66bc.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 478, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 474, "comments": 0, "shares": 474}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "251878bee34bf5540cc3be469051454bc89e00b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9i7Tq_O5OR_lKTntPDZxBD0Jjfg.vefuZ9G7oxM2LZozku8Z25yPPFr_RWX4uvO9qpgPfLA_ClIOy1luQblZYXekrUha9i2O2KbB89888jVrb_T2akKD4AvZBLdhr41NsSOsS1ue90.w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adam Edelman", "published": "2017-10-04T01:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. to Expel 15 Officials From Cuban Embassy Over Havana Attacks - NBC News", "text": "The move came just days after the department ordered the departure of nonemergency personnel assigned to the U.S. embassy in Havana , as well as their family members.\nTillerson said Tuesday that the withdrawal in Havana was meant \u201cto minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm\u201d until \u201cthe government of Cuba can ensure the safety of our diplomats in Cuba.\u201d\nThe statement was referring to the baffling sonic attacks that had staffers at the U.S. embassy in Cuba suffering from headaches, hearing loss, memory issues and other symptoms.

He had suffered a stroke in 2012 and was moved to a German hospital later that year for treatment. Jalal Talabani seen in 2006. POOL New / Reuters \nTalabani led one of Iraq's main Kurdish factions and went on to become the country's first official president after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. He was often seen as a unifying elder statesman who could soothe tempers among Iraq's Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds. \nTalabani has been absent from Iraqi politics since he was hospitalized in 2012 and his death comes amid soaring tensions between Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region and the central government following a referendum on independence held last week . \nThe referendum, spearheaded by Kurdish president Masoud Barzani, was celebrated in the Kurdish region as a declaration of independence, but the move is not expected to lead to an independent Kurdish state anytime soon and has further isolated the small land-locked region. Baghdad has banned international flights and is threatening to take control of Kurdish borders. Jalal Talabani pictured at the UN in New York in 2009. JASON SZENES / EPA \nDreams of statehood have been central to Kurdish politics for decades and in the lead-up to the referendum vote, Barzani repeatedly told supporters he wished Talabani could be there to see it. \nLike many senior Kurdish politicians, Talabani was a longtime guerrilla fighter. In the 1960s, he joined the Kurdish uprising against the Iraqi government and took up arms against the central government again in the 1970s. \nAfter fighting a bitter civil war against forces loyal to Barzani in the 1990s, the two Kurdish factions came together to govern their autonomous region, which boasts its own regional government, parliament and armed forces.

Those people were given seven days to leave the United States. \nThe official said the expulsion, which amounts to about 60 percent of the employees at the embassy, does not signal a change in policy or a determination of responsibility for the attacks, and added that the U.S. was maintaining diplomatic relations with Havana. \nThe expulsion, however, will leave the Cuban embassy in Washington \u2014 which has fewer than 25 workers \u2014 with just a handful of employees and is certain to affect the mission\u2019s ability to function.

Michael Orrell / AP file Unlike Halloween or Thanksgiving, we can't consult our calendars to know exactly when it will hit, but we know it's coming: the flu. Doctors and pharmacies are advertising the annual flu vaccine, prompting many to ask, \"Should I get the flu shot?\" You needn't read too far to know that the overwhelming consensus of the medical community is a resounding YES. But other questions abound: What is in this vaccine? Why should I get it every single year? If I get the vaccine can I still get the flu? Can the shot actually give me the flu? With so many viruses circulating, it's a yearly challenge for scientists to predict which three or four will prove to be the season's most prevalent and potent flu viruses. It's not unreasonable to have such questions when a stranger in a lab coat asks you to sign a waiver and then comes at you with a needle. And many of us have had experiences that warrant skepticism about the flu vaccine, myself included. Last year I got the flu shot and then three months later, I went to the doctor with a sore throat and fever and what did he tell me I had? The flu. Why did I even bother getting the vaccine? I brought these and other questions to a few doctors, including Dr. Michael Chang , a pediatric infectious disease specialist with Children\u2019s Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, TX who generously took an hour to go through it all with me, though not without adding that it would take many more hours to really explain this \"fascinating virus,\" and the vaccines engineered to fight it. Subscribe Let our news meet your inbox. SIGN UP What you need to know about the flu shot 00:56 The Flu Comprises More Than One Virus \u2014 And So Does The Vaccine We call it the flu like there's only one, but every year the flu is different, and is not singular \u2014 there are different types of flu viruses. The reason we call it the flu instead of being more specific is because each of the viruses function more or less the same, and because they pop up like clockwork every year in a seasonal epidemic. \"Every winter we know that a flu epidemic will spread around the globe, with maybe three or four strains of the virus [proving to be] the most predominant,\" says Dr. Chang, adding that a flu virus typically enters the body through the eyes, nose and mouth. From there it targets the lungs, which is where things can get really bad. \"The flu will cause all the usual upper respiratory symptoms, but it can also cause viral pneumonia or viral lower respiratory infection which can be more serious, and if you have a very severe flu infection, other organs in the body can be affected,\" says Chang. With so many viruses circulating, it's a yearly challenge for scientists to predict which three or four will prove to be the season's most prevalent and potent flu viruses. \"Predicting what the predominant strains of the flu will be each winter is done through a lot of surveillance around the world,\" says Chang. \"We look at all the cases of flu that happen around the world to try to predict each season in advance.\" Once they pinpoint the strains that appear to be the epidemic ones, scientists grow the vaccines either in chicken eggs, or in specialized bacteria. Then they inactivate the virus; \"essentially they kill it and chop it up,\" explains Chang, adding that this is not the only way to engineer a flu vaccine but it is currently the most common. These dead flu parts get packaged with other ingredients needed to make a vaccine (a concoction of proteins, fats, and antigens). It Is Impossible For The Vaccine To Give You The Flu The fact that the viruses in the vaccine are dead is a critical point: a dead virus cannot infect you. It just can\u2019t. \"A lot of times people will say they or their children got the flu from the vaccine, and that is just not possible,\" notes Chang. \"That said, some people do feel bad after: muscle aches, low grade fever, achy arm [where they had the injection]. I always tell patients that this is good in the sense that it means your immune system is having a response, which is what we want.\" What you don't want is an allergic reaction, of course \u2014 but these are exceedingly rare. The fact that the viruses in the vaccine are dead is a critical point: a dead virus cannot infect you. It just can\u2019t. The fact that the viruses in the vaccine are dead is a critical point: a dead virus cannot infect you. It just can\u2019t. \"If after getting the vaccine there is any difficulty breathing, swelling of face or tongue or blockage of airways, that is a severe allergic reaction,\" says Chang. Patients should also keep an eye on their temperature. A fever of around 101 degrees is common. A Tylenol should help reduce this and other symptoms, but if you\u2019re still ill or getting worse after 48 hours, or if the site of injection is swelling tremendously to the point where you cannot move it \u2014 get to the doctor. Chang notes that even if you're among the lucky few who feel totally fine after the flu shot with no soreness or low fever, this does not mean your immune system didn't respond or that the flu vaccine didn't work. When To Get The Shot And How Long It Lasts Now, let's say you get the flu shot and two days later you get the flu. Well, you didn't get sick because of the vaccine (because again, dead viruses are non-infectious), but it does point to a loophole: the vaccine takes two to three weeks to have full effect. This is why doctors recommend getting it as soon as it's available. If you get the vaccine now, you should be covered through the duration of the flu season, which can start as early as mid-fall, and end as late as early spring. How long the vaccine lives in your system depends on your immune system, but for the general patient it's between six months and a year. \"The vaccine is not that long-lived in part because the viruses that cause the flu are very smart and keep changing to infect us,\" says Dr. Megha Tewari , a family medicine doctor at Memorial Hermann Medical Group. \"This is why I tell my patients to get the flu shot every year.\" The Goal Of The Vaccine Is Not Necessarily To Prevent Flu Optimally, the flu vaccine will prevent you from getting the flu, but that's actually secondary to the primary goals of the vaccine which are to prevent epidemic and to reduce the cases of severe flu infection. How long the vaccine lives in your system depends on your immune system, but for the general patient it's between six months and a year. How long the vaccine lives in your system depends on your immune system, but for the general patient it's between six months and a year. \"At its most effective the flu shot would prevent you from getting the flu, but really when you look at studies, the purpose of the vaccine is to reduce the number of severe flu illnesses that require going to the hospital,\" says Chang. \"In other words if you get the flu vaccine, the real goal is even if you do get the flu that you are not as sick as you would be if you had not gotten the vaccine.\" Basically, if your immune system is primed to deal with the virus, should it still attack you, you likely won't develop a severe flu infection. Another purpose of the flu vaccine: not everyone can get it, so it's important that people who can receive it do so that \"we build herd immunity,\" says Dr. Tewari. \"A lot of patients who have immunological diseases, or an organ transplant, have cancer or other conditions may not be strong enough to get a flu vaccine,\" Tewari adds. \"But if those around them are vaccinated, we develop a herd immunity, so that hopefully the few people who can't get the vaccine will not get infected.\" The vast majority of people over the age of six months are A-OK to get a flu shot. Both Dr. Chang and Dr. Tewari insist that there are very few exceptions. Even if you have an egg allergy (remember flu vaccines are often cultivated in eggs) your doctor can recommend an alternate type of vaccine if needed. What If I'm Pregnant? Just last week there was a study published suggesting that the flu vaccine could be associated with early-term miscarriage in some pregnant women. But this finding is far from conclusive, and doctors still advise pregnant women to get the flu shot. \"Let\u2019s be clear: this study does not suggest the flu vaccine can cause an increased risk of miscarriage,\" says Dr. Sherry Ross an OB/GYN at Providence Saint John\u2019s Health Center. \"The flu is more likely to cause serious illness in pregnancy compared to those women who are not pregnant [because] in pregnancy there are changes in the immune system, heart and lung function that make pregnant women more prone to severe illness from the flu which can lead to hospitalization or even death. Other problems as a result of the flu include dehydration, miscarriage and preterm labor.\" Furthermore, a flu shot helps protect newborns from getting the flu. \"Babies can't get the flu vaccine until thy are six months, so by getting the vaccine herself, the mom will make the antibodies and pass it onto the baby, protecting them from severe flu for the first months of their lives,\" says Dr. Chang. Still, it is totally understandable to be concerned, so if you are pregnant and have questions, talk to your OB/GYN. And if you're a parent who is unsure if your six month old is really ready for the flu vaccine, pay a visit to your pediatrician. \"If anything it's a good excuse for a well baby visit,\" adds Chang, who admits that as a pediatrician he holds some bias when recommending that parents take their little ones to the pediatrician for their flu shots, but says he doesn't see any problem with having them administered at your local pharmacy. Children, like elderly people, are indeed more susceptible to developing severe flu. This is in part because they're ultra exposed in schools and daycare facilities (and you know, they may not have the best hand hygiene), but also because their immune systems haven't been toughened up. \"Children have had less experience with flu, whereas adults have more antibody from previous infections,\" says Dr. James D. Cherry, a distinguished research professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and UCLA Mattel Children\u2019s Hospital. Flu Shots Are Critical If You're In A Disaster Affected Area While doctors recommend that virtually everybody get their flu shot, Dr. Tewari, based in Houston, Texas makes the timely point that if you are in a disaster-affected area, it's particularly critical. \" Hurricane Harvey and the other natural disasters affecting many have brought dirty water, and viruses are not visible like mold so we don't even know what's in the air,\" says Tewari. \"People have been displaced, are living in shelters, wearing borrowed clothes and eating donated food. You just don't know what you're being exposed to. Plus, when you\u2019re stressed your immunity gets lowered.\" How to Make an Emergency Go Bag 01:09 For many of those still in the midst of natural disasters, a flu shot may sound like a ridiculous luxury at the moment, but it should be noted that many schools and county health departments run programs offering free flu shots. Even if you have health insurance, your flu shot may actually not be covered, so check with your provider. Presently the cheapest flu shot available looks to be at Costco , for $20.

Two new members, former Xerox Chief Executive Ursula Burns and former Merrill Lynch Chief Executive John Thain, joined the meeting Tuesday to round out the 11-member group. \nRelated: Can Companies Like Uber, Equifax Find Redemption After Scandals? \n\"Today, after welcoming its new directors Ursula Burns and John Thain, the Board voted unanimously to move forward with the proposed investment by SoftBank and with governance changes that would strengthen its independence and ensure equality among all shareholders,\" Uber's board said in a statement. \"SoftBank's interest is an incredible vote of confidence in Uber's business and long-term potential, and we look forward to finalizing the investment in the coming weeks.\" \nIn a statement issued by his representative, Kalanick said the board's unanimous vote marked \"a major step forward in Uber's journey to becoming a world class public company.\" \n\"We approved moving forward with the Softbank transaction and reached unanimous agreement on a new governance framework that will serve Uber well,\" he said. \nLast week, in an unexpected move, Kalanick used his right to fill two vacant board seats with Burns and Thain. \nThe two new appointments came as a \"complete surprise\" to Uber and the board of directors, and were a \"highly unusual\" move, according to an internal letter from new Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi to employees obtained by Recode . \n\"That is precisely why we are working to put in place world-class governance to ensure that we are building a company every employee and shareholder can be proud of,\" Uber said in a statement. \nKalanick's right to fill those seats is being challenged in a lawsuit filed by Benchmark, an early investor that owns 13 percent of Uber. Benchmark, which wants Kalanick off the board, alleges that he \"fraudulently\" obtained the power in 2016 to name three additional members to the company's board of directors . After Kalanick resigned in June , he appointed himself to one of those seats. \nA source familiar with Kalanick's thinking said he didn't intend to fill the seats until the legal matter, which is in arbitration, was completed. However, after corporate governance proposals were presented last week, he decided to exercise his right to appoint Burns and Thain. \nBenchmark said it never would have granted Kalanick control over the additional seats had it been aware of the \"gross mismanagement of Uber and several other significant matters,\" according to the complaint. \nThe board meeting comes as Uber's new chief executive met with a London transport official, trying to persuade the city to reverse a decision to not renew Uber's license. \nTransport for London said in a statement last month that \"Uber's approach and conduct demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues which have potential public safety and security implications.\" Dara Khosrowshahi attends the Allen &amp; Company Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho on July 13, 2012.

As Uber goes through the appeals process, the company's 40,000 drivers will be able to continue operating in the city. \nThe meeting also came as Jo Bertram, head of Uber's Northern Europe markets, announced that she is leaving the company. Her departure wasn't related to the London license issue, according to reports.

But they got one Thursday morning as a team announced they\u2019d detected the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion years ago, the echo riding on gravitational waves across the universe just as Albert Einstein predicted. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we have detected gravitational waves,\u201d David Reitze, executive director of Caltech\u2019s twin Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) laboratory, said at a news conference in Washington, D.C. \u201cWe did it!\u201d Reitze said to applause. Audience Cheers As Physicist Confirms Einstein's Theory 03:15 \u201cThese gravitational waves were produced by two colliding black holes that merged to form a single black hole 1.3 billion years ago.\u201d Such a collision has never been seen before. Black holes are powerful objects, collapsed stars that pull in vast quantities of matter and concentrate them into a very small area. Ladies and gentlemen, we have detected gravitational waves. Ladies and gentlemen, we have detected gravitational waves. These two were about 150 km, just under 100 miles, in diameter. \u201cPack 30 times the mass of the sun into that,\u201d Reitze said. \u201cAccelerate it to about half the speed of light.\u201d Two of these massive, fast-moving objects circled one another, crashed, and merged to form a single black hole. \u201cThat\u2019s what we saw here. It\u2019s mind-boggling,\u201d Reitze said. It was a monstrous collision, so big that it literally shook the fabric of space-time. These waves then spread a little bit like ripples expanding from the plunk of a pebble in water. Gravitational Waves Discovered - But What Exactly Are They? 00:40 \u201cIt goes right through matter, right though stars,\u201d Reitze said. After 1.3 billion years, across trillions of miles of space, the waves are infinitesimally small \u2014 1/1000th the size of a proton, a subatomic particle. But these small waves still stretch and compress space. It took special detectors \u2014 the LIGO system \u2014 to detect these tiny, tiny ripples. \u201cYou can see that the Earth is jiggling like jello,\u201d Reitze said. \"The description of this observation is beautifully described in the Einstein theory of general relativity formulated 100 years ago and comprises the first test of the theory in strong gravitation. It would have been wonderful to watch Einstein's face had we been able to tell him,\" Rainer Weiss, an emeritus professor of physics at MIT who was part of the team that originally proposed building LIGO, said in a statement. You can see that the Earth is jiggling like jello. You can see that the Earth is jiggling like jello. \"With this discovery, we humans are embarking on a marvelous new quest: the quest to explore the warped side of the universe -- objects and phenomena that are made from warped spacetime,\u201d added Kip Thorne, Caltech's Richard P. Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics. It\u2019s really hard to detect these tiny movements, so researchers built LIGO, a pair of 2.5 mile long, L-shaped interferometers that use laser light split into two beams that travel back and forth down its arms. They monitor the distance between mirrors precisely positioned at the ends of the arms. Gravitational waves would move the mirrors just slightly. Having one in Louisiana and one in Hanford, Washington, helps satisfy scientists that what is making the mirrors wiggle is coming from off the planet. They went online last September after some adjustments. No one thought they\u2019d get a signal so fast. Northwestern University physicist Vicky Kalogera was at home when it happened. \u201cThat evening, while preparing dinner for my family, I saw a text message from a graduate student in my LIGO group: \u2018Have you been keeping up with LIGO emails today? Loud trigger!\u2019 \u201c Kalogera said. \u201cI dropped everything, went to my laptop and started reading the emails. And there was a clear sense that we have a signal in our data. A gravitational wave signal that is very loud, very strong, and we definitely have to do something about it and figure out what exactly it is.\u201d We may see things that we never saw before. We may see things that we never saw before. Each LIGO facility had recorded the same signal at almost the same time. \u201cIt was exactly what you would expect when Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity would predict with two massive objects like black holes circling and merging together,\u201d Reitze said. \u201cTo detect something in the first few days after turning on our new detectors and to have a detection of an unexpected source \u2013 \u2018heavy\u2019 binary black holes -- is just amazing,\u201d Kalogera said \u201cWhat is really exciting is what comes next,\u201d Reitze said. \u201cI think we are opening a window on the universe.\u201d Physicists use visible and other spectra of light, x-rays and microwaves to observe the universe. Now they can use gravitational waves, too. \u201cUp to now, we have been deaf to gravitational waves. Now we can hear them,\u201d Reitze said. \u201cWe are going to be able to hear more of these things. \u2026We may see things that we never saw before.\u201d Subscribe Let our news meet your inbox.

But it is set to take effect Friday because a federal appeals court refused to keep blocking it. A customer walks into Steve's, a downtown Jackson, Miss., restaurant, that displays this nondiscrimination sticker in the doorway, Monday, Oct. 2, 2017. Rogelio V. Solis / AP \nChampioned and signed by Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in 2016, the law protects three beliefs: that marriage is only between a man and a woman, sex should only take place in such a marriage, and a person's gender is determined at birth and cannot be altered. \n\"This is an unfair and unconstitutional law,\" said Robert McDuff, an attorney for some of the gay and straight Mississippi residents who sued to try to block it. \nThe Mississippi law would allow clerks to cite religious objections to recuse themselves from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and would protect merchants who refuse services to LGBTQ people. It could affect adoptions and foster care, business practices and school bathroom policies. \u201c Along with other anti- LGBT laws across the country like those in North Carolina and Texas, these laws are a pack of wolves in sheep's clothing, dressing up discrimination and calling it religious freedom.\u201d \nThe Supreme Court will hear a case this term about a Colorado baker who said he should not be forced to violate his own religious beliefs by making a cake for a married same-sex couple. The Trump administration is supporting the baker , who disagreed with a Colorado law that bars discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. \nThe Mississippi law would affect actions by government workers and people working for private businesses. \nU.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves blocked the Mississippi law from taking effect in July 2016, ruling it unconstitutionally establishes preferred beliefs and creates unequal treatment for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. \nA panel of judges from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the hold on the law June 22, saying people who sued the state had failed to show they would be harmed. Plaintiffs asked the whole appeals court to reverse that decision, but the court said last Friday that it would not do so. That opens the way for the law to take effect in Mississippi. \nRelated: Vocal LGBTQ Opponent Roy Moore a Step Closer to US Senate Seat \nMcDuff, the Mississippi Center for Justice and the gay-rights group Lambda Legal are asking the Supreme Court to reverse the 5th Circuit's action. \nThe law \"creates a toxic environment of fear and prejudice,\" Susan Sommer, director of constitutional litigation for Lambda Legal, said in a statement Monday. \"Along with other anti-LGBT laws across the country like those in North Carolina and Texas, these laws are a pack of wolves in sheep's clothing, dressing up discrimination and calling it religious freedom.\" \nAn Arizona-based Christian group, Alliance Defending Freedom, helped write the Mississippi law. \n\"As I have said from the beginning, this law was democratically enacted and is perfectly constitutional,\" Gov. Bryant said Monday. \"The people of Mississippi have the right to ensure that all of our citizens are free to peacefully live and work without fear of being punished for their sincerely held religious beliefs.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mcduff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phil bryant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carlton reeves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rogelio v. solis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susan sommer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nbc news oct", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "us senate seat  mcduff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "5th circuit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lambda legal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alliance defending freedom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "5th u.s. circuit court of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi center for justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miss.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:11:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e206101ce6b6246ec7be965fda6159add3e9c404", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR93qbSsuKmhHiLKTqP7yZwKeps7NU6HqSorIC3uK1.00HO0UJ7PYHpH7QL6ryzQ.vMaQX9Ws08XUUblWvvw7b0kzrlfHM5M9DuU_6..O4_kiaj0vdztJ70lw4jqDbIz_.kZvHoWK7eNg--", "site_full": "www.nbcnews.com", "site": "nbcnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "Daymond John Talks Reintroducing FUBU, Philanthropy and His Legacy - NBC News", "title_full": "Daymond John Talks Reintroducing FUBU, Philanthropy and His Legacy - NBC News", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.052, "main_image": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_37/2150456/170911-fubu25-1-blk-0953a_f89315e2f327f417b914a17737fc24c1.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 478, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 93, "comments": 0, "shares": 93}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 11}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e206101ce6b6246ec7be965fda6159add3e9c404", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR93qbSsuKmhHiLKTqP7yZwKeps7NU6HqSorIC3uK1.00HO0UJ7PYHpH7QL6ryzQ.vMaQX9Ws08XUUblWvvw7b0kzrlfHM5M9DuU_6..O4_kiaj0vdztJ70lw4jqDbIz_.kZvHoWK7eNg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Christopher A.

Daniel advertisement \nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of FUBU pioneering the integration of fashion with hip-hop culture, multimedia and entertainment. The urban apparel line founded by CEO Daymond John was synonymous with T-shirts, sweatshirts, hoodies, hats, footwear and denim with the conjoined \u201cFB\u201d in bold, all caps font stitched on the fabric. \nEntertainers like LL Cool J, Mary J. Blige, TLC, P. Diddy and Beyonce all wore FUBU to award shows, in music videos and in numerous print and television ads. At its pinnacle, FUBU had netted $350 million in sales through 5,000 retail stores: eventually grossing more than $6 billion globally. \nAn acronym that stands for \u201cFor Us By Us,\u201d FUBU was created to specifically target young African-American consumers. John, who started the operation with his childhood friends Keith Perrin, J. Alexander Martin and Carl Brown, created the clothing as a response to high-profile fashion brands expressing they didn\u2019t want to market their collections to ethnic audiences. Daymond John at the Miller Lite Tap the Future event. Courtesy of MillerCoors \n\u201cI\u2019ve been really fortunate to have been part of something that\u2019s a globally recognized brand,\u201d the modest coach and panelist on ABC\u2019s Emmy-winning reality series \"Shark Tank,\" told NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s close to me. I don\u2019t know necessarily the effect or impact that I\u2019ve had, but whatever it is, I\u2019m grateful.\u201d The concept for FUBU originated around 1989 as ski hats tied with string. John and his peers sold the merchandise on the corner for $10 each. \nThree years later, John, then waiting tables at Red Lobster, mortgaged his mother\u2019s three-level Queens, N.Y. home for $100,000 to devote his time, energy and space towards mass producing headwear and shirts. Half of the house became an assembly line; the other half was living quarters for he and his team. Starting out with a $40 budget, John and Team FUBU hit up expos and tradeshows across the Northeast. Their inventory only consisted of about 10 shirts that they ended up rotating on various music videos sets. \nRelated: Shark Tank's Daymond John Breaks Down 'The Power of Broke' \nDemand began to exceed product availability, leaving John, a savvy negotiator, to shake many hands as he searched for investors. Banks kept denying him capital. Before long, Samsung became a major investor in FUBU. \n\u201cNetworking is the number one reason why people end up expanding their brand,\u201d said the problem solver. \u201cYou have to enjoy everybody that\u2019s around you and get to know them. Running a business is very hard. It takes a lot of work, energy, discipline and cash. You have to stay true to yourself, your passion and be consistent.\u201d A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews) \nFUBU\u2019s popularity soared, producing accessories for all ages and sexes. The clothes\u2019 raw materials were imported from around the world. The clothing line created special edition collections commemorating Fat Albert and sports icon Muhammad Ali. Its record label, FUBU Records, released a gold-selling compilation in 2001 with Universal Records. Subsequent investments include a radio station, television network, fragrances, bedding, formal wear, personal care products, a NASCAR-BUSCH sponsorship and luxury hotels. \nHip-hop moguls like P. Diddy, Nelly and Jay-Z borrowed John\u2019s template to develop their own successful clothing companies. The man behind branding and marketing entity The Shark Group is humbled to witness those artists\u2019 evolution into cultural icons. \n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the middle of doing something, you don\u2019t realize the effect it may have with people,\u201d shared John. \u201cI had much bigger hope for FUBU. Ralph Lauren probably does about $3 to $4 billion a year still. I did $6 billion over 20 years. When anybody touches any extension of anything that you do, you should be extremely grateful.\u201d \nPre-FUBU, John was no stranger to entrepreneurship. The results-oriented Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship appointed by former President Barack Obama owned six businesses, including a delivery service. Prior to judging a pitch competition, Miller Lite\u2019s Tap the Future, in Atlanta, the best-selling author of \u201cDisplay of Power,\u201d \u201cThe Brand Within\u201d and \u201cThe Power of Broke\u201d shared some of his eye-opening realizations with NBC News that signaled FUBU\u2019s growth. A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews) \nIt\u2019s the same pearls of wisdom, or \u201cShark Tools,\u201d the businessman and brand strategist offers to budding entrepreneurs he mentors and Fortune 500 companies he consults. \u201cIt\u2019s about setting up a structure and making sure that all legal is in place,\u201d said John. \u201cYou have to know about trademarks and patents. Money is not going to really help you; it\u2019s your ability to solve problems, create a team and build a genuine following that can help you.\u201d \nRelated: How This 11-Year-Old Turned Something Scary Into Something Sweet \nJohn, a thyroid cancer survivor, continues: \u201cBeing a boss is not somebody who comes in late, leaves early and fires everybody. You generally come in before everybody and leave after everybody. The buck stops with you, but it\u2019s a great process: a process you constantly have to learn. You don\u2019t get to a certain level and stop.\u201d \nIn the early 2000s, FUBU\u2019s visibility began to diminish. The recession later that decade caused FUBU to further tank. Still, FUBU\u2019s name never went anywhere. Daymond John at the Miller Lite Tap the Future event. Courtesy of MillerCoors \nFUBU was recently revamped online through partnerships with Urban Outfitters and Ebbet Field Flannels. The retailers carry limited edition capsule collections of FUBU\u2019s original designs and sports jerseys. In Brooklyn, FUBU has opened six mobile stores. Grammy-winning entertainer Chris Brown took photos on-stage wearing a basic FUBU tee. \nReintroducing FUBU to a younger audience, John said, stemmed from noticing an influx of customers purchasing the past collections on eBay. \u201cReinvention is always going out, knowing who you are, what your brand is and finding an audience that resonates with it,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt\u2019s the customer first. Some kids will not even know FUBU from what it was 20 years ago. They\u2019ll just know it from getting on a phone with a whole bunch of content on it sensitive to what they like. It has to stay true to the brand. People have to demand it more than we\u2019re trying to push it.\u201d A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews) \nThese days, John is far from recreating another FUBU. The venture capitalist contributes to causes like donating mattresses and serving breakfast at homeless shelters. In February, he built a 17,000-square-foot member-based creative incubator, Blueprint + co, in New York City. \u201cShark Tank\u201d is in its eighth season. He also invested in a barbecue restaurant and companies that produce novelty eyeglasses, bow ties and belts. \nRelated: Muktar Onifade: General Motors Engineer Serves Street Swag \nJohn is grateful for FUBU allowing him to solidify a legacy by helping others fulfill their entrepreneurial aspirations. \u201cI\u2019m obviously a little more mature than when I was younger,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that time, I was working so hard on my first name. Now, I work so hard on what my last name will leave.\u201d \nFollow NBCBLK on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram Christopher A.

But before gaining its own name recognition, Giant got its start making orders for others, including Schwinn, one of the U.S.\u2019s most well-known brands. \n\u201cAt that time in Taiwan, nobody will ever think of making their own brand, if you are doing [exporting],\u201d Bonnie Tu, who became Giant\u2019s chairperson in January, told NBC News during a sit-down interview at Giant headquarters in Taichung, Taiwan. \u201cI think most Taiwanese think you just make products for American or European companies.\u201d \u201cThe reason I like to promote Liv is not because I want to sell more bicycles. It\u2019s because when I\u2019m riding the bicycle I feel so happy.\u201d \nKing Liu, Tu\u2019s uncle, established Giant in 1972 with an investment of $4 million New Taiwan Dollars (the rough equivalent of US$ 133,000 as of publication) and 30-some-odd workers, according to the company\u2019s timeline . That first year, Giant made and sold around 3,800 bikes. \nWhen Tu, who studied English at Tamkang University in Taiwan, joined the business in 1978, Giant began producing a line of bikes called World Sport for the Schwinn Bicycle Company, according to Tu and Giant. \n\u201cAfter visiting them so many times, after they came to see our factory for many times, finally they gave us a small trial order,\u201d Tu recalled. \nMeanwhile, Giant started marketing under its own brand name, officially launching in Taiwan in 1981, Tu said. The company has since laid down roots all across the globe , including in Europe, Asia, North and South America, Africa, the Middle East, Australia, and New Zealand. Workers assemble Giant bikes at the company's headquarters in Taichung, Taiwan. Chris Fuchs / NBC News \nGiant also ended its agreement with Schwinn in 1991, a year before Schwinn filed for bankruptcy . \nBut breaking into the U.S. market, which Giant entered in 1987, took a great deal of time and patience, Tu said. Giant\u2019s annual losses in the U.S. were around $5 million (plus or minus $1 million) until 2010, according to Tu, who served as the company's chief financial officer. \n\u201cFor 23 years, we were drifting up and down,\u201d she said. \nProfit earned in China beginning in 1997, several years after Giant entered that market, helped to cover losses in the U.S, Tu added. \nGiant focuses on research and development to make cycling fun, Tu said. Over the years, the company has experimented with different materials in its frame design. Tu said those include chromoly, a strong steel alloy made with chromium and molybdenum, and carbon fiber, a lightweight substance used in the fuselage and wings of planes. \nThe carbon fiber design, according to Giant, helps cyclists achieve high speeds, especially during a sprint. It worked for Tour de France 2017 King of the Mountains winner Warren Barguil , who Giant said rode a carbon fiber bicycle in that race on behalf of Sunweb, a German cycling team that uses Giant bikes. \nLooking back at Giant\u2019s nearly half century in the business, Tu said she credits its success to its ability to lead rather than follow. \n\u201cI think most Taiwanese companies can be very good, but at a certain point they will stop improving, and they do not reinvent themselves,\u201d she said. \nWhile Giant bikes headline famous races like the Tour de France, they can also be spotted on the streets of Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, as part of a public bike sharing program called YouBike . Giant began collaborating with the Taipei City Government\u2019s YouBike program in 2012, according to the company. \nThe program has grown in popularity in this population-dense city of 2.7 million as a foil to a transportation culture long dominated by the fast, convenient, noisy, and exhaust-spewing scooter. \u2014 Team Sunweb (@TeamSunweb) February 3, 2017 \nAn increase in dedicated bike lanes, reasonable rental fees, and more than 230 docking stations and 7,700 bikes have made YouBike a sometimes attractive alternative to subways and buses, as well as scooters and cars, customers say. \nTo date, YouBike has logged more than 89 million rentals, according to a tally on its website . \n\u201cIt\u2019s very convenient and you can also get your exercise in,\u201d Chia-ling Ye said in Mandarin while docking her bike with a friend outside the Zhongshan subway station one afternoon in late August. \nJen-hao Ou, another customer who uses YouBike once a week, agreed in part with Ye. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a handy transportation tool for short distances,\u201d Ou said, though he added that the hot, muggy summer weather and crowded traffic conditions in Taipei pose challenges for longer distances.

Chris Fuchs / NBC News \nWhile Giant in its first half-year financials reported double-digit sales growth in local currency for its private brand in Europe and the U.S., the company\u2019s revenue dropped by 7.4 percent to NT$26.9 billion (US$892 million) compared to the same period last year, according to a company news release in August . \nNet income before and after taxes were NT$1.65 billion (US$547.1 million) and NT$1.19 billion (US$394.6 million) respectively for the first six months, a drop of 29.5 percent compared to the same period last year. \nThe statement attributed profit loss chiefly to unfavorable currency exchange rates. Giant also said its company in China suffered adversely from a continued slump in the Chinese market and also from bike sharing there. \nBut in Europe, Giant\u2019s growth came primarily from hot-selling electric bicycles, while mountain and road bikes did well in the U.S., the financial report said. The U.S. market, according to Giant, has also responded favorably to its electric bikes, which many in the industry view as the next big thing in cycling. Workers assemble Giant bikes at the company's headquarters in Taichung, Taiwan. Chris Fuchs / NBC News \nA company spokeswoman said around 30 percent of bicycles made by Giant today are for other companies. \nTu said she\u2019s also proud of a women\u2019s line of bikes she created for Giant in 2008 called \u201c Liv .\u201d The need became apparent, she said, after joining a cycling event across Taiwan. The quality of the women\u2019s bike she rode and the cycling outfit she wore made for a tough go, Tu said. \n\u201cSo I started to think why don\u2019t we have a decent bike for female[s] and why [do] I have to wear a man\u2019s clothes,\u201d she explained. \u201cThis is also not right.\u201d \nLiv has proven successful in many English-speaking countries, Tu said, including Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. It\u2019s also been a hit in France, she added. Total sales revenue for 2016 was over US$100 million, according to Tu. \nAt the age of 68, Tu herself has become an avid cyclist, riding everywhere every chance she gets, she said. \u201cFor 23 years, we were drifting up and down.\u201d \n\u201cThe reason I like to promote Liv is not because I want to sell more bicycles,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s because when I\u2019m riding the bicycle I feel so happy. And after I ride I feel more confident, and I feel more [in] control of everything.\u201d \nEven after being in the bike business for so long, Giant still surprises some analysts when they learn it\u2019s a company from Taiwan, Tu said. \nFor many Taiwanese Americans already in the know, Giant\u2019s success story is a bright spot and source of pride. \n\u201cThat makes me feel very honored,\u201d Tu said. \u201cBut [it] also reminds me I have to work harder, that Giant has to keep up the good work, that I shouldn\u2019t let them down.\u201d \nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and Tumblr .

These immigrants received temporary work permits and deportation protections under an Obama administration program, but now face a frighteningly uncertain future. \nWhen Trump announced last month he was ending the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, he gave Congress six months to come up with a solution. If there is no action by early March, the immigrants' work permits will begin to expire and they will become subject to deportation, administration officials said as dozens of Dreamers in orange shirts watched from the audience. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans say DACA is unconstitutional and argue that President Barack Obama exceeded his authority in creating it. \n\"Creating a legislative fix is the right thing to do, but there's a big caveat,\" said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who was among a small group of GOP lawmakers focused on the issue who dined with Trump at the White House on Monday night. \n\"Before we provide legal status to these young people, we must reassure and actually regain the public confidence that we're serious when it comes to enforcing the law and securing our border,\" Cornyn said. \nSen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat whose home state of California is home to large numbers of Dreamers, countered that \"these youths should not be political footballs.\" \n\"These young people have put their trust in the federal government and they have done everything asked of them,\" she said. \"They are counting on us to put aside partisanship and find a solution to this problem.\" \nCongressional Democratic leaders, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, announced an agreement with Trump last month to enshrine the DACA protections in law, while separately addressing the issue of Trump's promised border wall. But the terms of the deal quickly came into dispute with Republicans denying there was one at all. \nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa opened the hearing saying a compromise was in reach, but any plan \"has to include robust border security, and by that, I don't mean a wall.\" Associated Press", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dianne feinstein", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck grassley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dougherty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cornyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john cornyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congressional democratic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:28:40.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bac884fe8f607efdaf1c4c7876160b9d2a10423c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR93qbSsuKmhHiLKTqP7yZwEq1lwG87yMs80qovcP54QPKonIomLf29rdBU0XyE_Q7a29XEJH0Wl3QlXrYZXou64uM4V_C4FRxx9l9ri3k6pe9t2CxntwcCqgcZSwKimeLlvz2VSvuiWPf6D4EqOtA7ITF67heWVwU-", "site_full": "www.nbcnews.com", "site": "nbcnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032091/device/rss/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "NBC News Top Stories", "title": "'Vegas Is Next': Stranger Warned Las Vegas Man", "title_full": "'Vegas Is Next': Stranger Warned Las Vegas Man", "published": "2017-10-04T00:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_40/2176761/171003-vegas-strip-emergency-vehicals-ew-455p_75f2eaf7abd9bb3f8a217e2a3b009426.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg", "performance_score": 8, "domain_rank": 478, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 895, "comments": 0, "shares": 895}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bac884fe8f607efdaf1c4c7876160b9d2a10423c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR93qbSsuKmhHiLKTqP7yZwEq1lwG87yMs80qovcP54QPKonIomLf29rdBU0XyE_Q7a29XEJH0Wl3QlXrYZXou64uM4V_C4FRxx9l9ri3k6pe9t2CxntwcCqgcZSwKimeLlvz2VSvuiWPf6D4EqOtA7ITF67heWVwU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "James Rainey", "published": "2017-10-04T00:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "'Vegas Is Next': Stranger Warned Las Vegas Man", "text": "Oct 3 2017, 5:12 pm ET Las Vegas Residents Feared They Would Be Target of Mass Shooting by James Rainey advertisement \nLAS VEGAS \u2014 The thought could come on subtly, as a queasy feeling, when some other city came under the gun.

Drew Angerer / Getty Images Sunday night's mass shooting in Las Vegas is shaping up to be the deadliest America has seen , but we can still help save lives by donating blood. During a news conference yesterday, Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman stressed the dire need for donations. \"What we ask for is blood,\" Goodman said. \"Please donate blood.\" Despite the unthinkable chaos, fear and grief, locals immediately took action, with lines stretching around the block to donate blood at blood banks in and around Las Vegas. The response has been so tremendous that the United Blood Services of Las Vegas says it has met the present demand for blood. Subscribe Let our news meet your inbox.

Blood donations do expire, so it's critical that people continue to donate through the coming weeks. Demand Has Been Met For Now, But Not for Long \"As of right now, United Blood Services of Las Vegas has made several deliveries of blood and blood products to Las Vegas-area hospitals and the blood needs for those hospitals are met,\" says Mitzy Edgecomb, vice president of donor marketing and communications at United Blood Services. \"We stand ready to send more if requested. We are encouraging people to schedule their donation appointments to give blood later this week or next instead of coming out right now to donate.\" Where to donate blood for Las Vegas victims 00:43 You can view the full list of United Blood Services locations online, as well as schedule an appointment through the website. You can also make an appointment to give blood and platelets through the American Red Cross by through the Red Cross Blood Donor App , or making an appointment online of over the phone (1-800-RED CROSS). \"The American Red Cross is always a great place to donate and they have systems in place to transport to other locations as needed,\" says Dr. Casey O'Connell , an associate professor of clinical medicine and clinical hematologist at USC's Keck School of Medicine, indicating that even if you're in another state, your blood could be shipped to Vegas. Red Blood Expires and Donations Are Needed Year-Round Blood donations do expire, so it's critical that people continue to donate through the coming weeks. \"In appropriate storage conditions, red blood cells typically last up to several weeks,\" says Dr. O'Connell, adding that the procedures for blood platelet donations is different and that platelets don\u2019t last nearly as long as red blood cells.

Keep in mind that after you donate blood, you should wait \"about three months\" to donate again, O'Connell says. But it's something all of should be doing on a regular basis, as the demand for blood donations is year-round. \u201cThe need for blood is constant,\" says Jodi Sheedy, communications director at American Red Cross. \"In fact, every two seconds, someone in the U.S. needs a blood transfusion. Accident and burn victims, heart surgery and organ transplant patients, and those receiving treatment for leukemia, cancer or sickle cell disease all count on blood and platelet donations to battle illness and injury.

Tom Udall, D-N.M., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., rallied chemical exposure victims and public health advocates on Tuesday to oppose President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to become the nation\u2019s top chemical regulator. \nMichael Dourson, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s chemical safety program, has sparked fierce opposition from Democrats and public health advocates for spending decades producing industry-funded research that critics say downplays the health risks of chemical substances. \n\"Instead of draining the swamp, [Trump] has filled it up with some of the swampiest creatures ever. And it keeps getting scarier \u2014 Michael Dourson might be the worst yet,\" Udall said. \"Dr. Dourson has made a career of creating junk science for industry.\" \n\"We need someone who\u2019s going to be a watchdog, not a lapdog for the special-interest chemical industry and other producers of contaminants and substances that can literally kill people, or stunt the growth of children, or make people sick,\" Blumenthal said. U.S. Senators Tom Udall (D-N.M.) held a press conference to oppose confirming Michael Dourson to lead the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) office, with victims and advocates alongside him, on Oct. 3, 2017 at the U.S. Capitol. Suzy Khimm / NBC News \nDourson, who is scheduled to appear before the Senate at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, did not respond to a request for comment. The EPA has circulated praise for Dourson from others in the toxicology field. \n\"Dr. Dourson is a highly qualified scientist, who is a professor at the University of Cincinnati and the founder of a nonprofit,\" said EPA spokesperson Liz Bowman, citing his leadership positions and awards. \nVictims of chemical exposure and their family members shared personal stories of being exposed to substances that Dourson has helped the chemical industry defend, producing research that companies have used to argue for weaker regulations and oversight. \nGwen Young\u2019s family lives in Hoosick Falls, New York, where a manufacturing plant contaminated the local drinking water with PFOA, a chemical that\u2019s been linked to cancer . Young, 12, said she has the highest PFOA levels in her blood among the children in her community. \n\"I don\u2019t really feel safe anywhere I go,\" Young said. \"I don\u2019t want this to have to happen to other kids. I don\u2019t think Michael Dourson is cut out to be in the position that he\u2019s nominated for.\" \nWhen DuPont was sued for PFOA exposure in West Virginia, the Dourson helped defend the company in court. DuPont had previously hired Dourson\u2019s firm, Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment, to establish a new exposure threshold. The level that Dourson\u2019s firm helped establish was 150 times higher than the level DuPont\u2019s own scientists had endorsed, and it was thousands of times higher than the level that EPA would ultimately set for drinking water in 2016. Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., leaves the Senate Democrats' weekly policy lunch in the Capitol on Sept. 7, 2016. Bill Clark / CQ Roll Call via AP \n\"We depend on the EPA, and specifically this position that [Dourson] would be filling, to protect us going forward,\" said Michael Hickey, another Hoosick Falls resident. \"We know that he won\u2019t be capable of doing that.\" Hickey\u2019s father died of kidney cancer after working at the Hoosick Falls plant that used PFOA, which is now a federal Superfund site . \nWithout Republican support, Democrats do not have the votes in the Senate to stop Dourson from being confirmed. But they say that it\u2019s especially critical to bring attention to his nomination in light of the sweeping overhaul of the Toxic Substance Control Act, pointing out that the law passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in 2016. \n\"Many people called it the most significant environmental law in 25 years to pass,\" Udall said. \"Now when you have a good law, the most important thing is implementation. So do you want a guy that\u2019s a toxicologist for hire to be doing the implementation?\" Suzy Khimm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom udall", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "richard blumenthal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suzy khimm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael hickey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "udall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hickey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blumenthal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gwen young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael dourson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liz bowman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dourson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toxicology excellence for risk assessment", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dupont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environmental protection agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc news  dourson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of cincinnati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-conn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hoosick falls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-n.m.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T02:25:31.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a48a44687062b62acb39110168c886a87e15d68", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9i7Tq_O5OR_lKTntPDZxBD0Jjfg.vefuZphWeJnju5o8DXsOmACFk7SYPFy75gri60APzQ_CzuVx485XtRUl7TgAWnLetFu43FvlMkkf11PdcegCrMBmsASt8LZh7_gzYxsnHBcpu5DQ--", "site_full": "www.nbcnews.com", "site": "nbcnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics", "site_categories": ["media", "television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Politics: Congress, Political Parties, National Security &amp; More - NBC News", "title": "Kennedy Is Key to Supreme Court Decision on Gerrymandering - NBC News", "title_full": "Kennedy Is Key to Supreme Court Decision on Gerrymandering - NBC News", "published": "2017-10-04T05:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_40/2176796/171003-justice-anthony-kennedy-ac-521p_b616b572141a70642f15a86d5c17fee1.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 478, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a48a44687062b62acb39110168c886a87e15d68", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9i7Tq_O5OR_lKTntPDZxBD0Jjfg.vefuZphWeJnju5o8DXsOmACFk7SYPFy75gri60APzQ_CzuVx485XtRUl7TgAWnLetFu43FvlMkkf11PdcegCrMBmsASt8LZh7_gzYxsnHBcpu5DQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Associated Press", "published": "2017-10-04T05:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kennedy Is Key to Supreme Court Decision on Gerrymandering - NBC News", "text": "The packed house included former California Gov.

Courts have struck down districts as racially biased for decades, and other partisan districting lawsuits are moving through the courts in Maryland and North Carolina.\nIn Wisconsin, a lower court sifted through evidence showing that Republicans packed Democrats into some districts and spread them out across others to maximize gains for the GOP. In one analysis, Democrats captured far fewer state Assembly seats even when they won roughly the same percentage of the statewide vote as Republicans.\nThe lower court concluded that the districting plans were drawn to discriminate against Democrats, the Republicans' advantage would endure even in the face of a strong Democratic showing at the polls and the plans could not be explained by other, non-partisan reasons.\nThe state is arguing the justices should put an end to courts' consideration of partisanship in districting plans and cautioning that far from being manageable, a ruling for the Democratic voters would open the door to a flood of lawsuits that would be based on cherry-picked evidence and hard for judges to manage.\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, the newest member of the court, likened the court's task in finding a way to measure partisanship with his preparations for grilling steak. \"I like my turmeric and other spices, but I'm not going to tell you how much.

But the measure won\u2019t reach Donald Trump because Senate Democrats have enough votes to kill it with a filibuster \u2014 a delaying tactic that takes 60 votes to overcome. \nThe measure remains a top priority for anti-abortion groups and a major target for abortion rights organizations. House debate came a week after the collapse of a GOP effort to repeal much of President Barack Obama's health care law. The repeal would have also have blocked federal money for Planned Parenthood. \nWhite House officials sent lawmakers a letter saying the measure \"would help to facilitate the culture of life to which our nation aspires.\" That praise was in contrast to the certain veto similar bills faced under Obama. \nHe never had to act. The Democratic-controlled Senate didn't even consider the bill after the House approved it in 2013, and a House-passed measure in 2015 was rejected by a GOP-run Senate. \nThat same fate awaits it this year. Republicans have a 52-48 Senate majority but overwhelming Democratic opposition means the measure would never reach the 60 votes it would need to pass. \nAsked this week if the Senate would consider the measure after House passage, No. 2 Senate GOP leader John Cornyn of Texas said, \"That's not a near-term priority.\" Senate GOP leaders are now focusing on tax cuts. \nRelated: Kentucky\u2019s Last Abortion Clinic Fights to Stay Open in Court \nEven so, National Right to Life Committee legislative director Jennifer Popik said her group wants the Senate to vote on the measure because \"it highlights for people across the country how extreme people on the other side are on this issue.\" \nThe White House letter also cited \"recent advancements\" showing \"the physical structures necessary to experience pain\" are developed 20 weeks after fertilization. Republicans cited scientific evidence backing that view during House debate. \n\"These unborn babies are feeling pain. They suffer. That is really hard to hear and really hard to say,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. \nDemocrats rejected that. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said fetuses cannot experience pain before at least 24 weeks of development. In an interview, the group's chief executive officer, Hal Lawrence, said \"the overwhelming amount of evidence\" shows fetuses younger than that have reflex activity but lack the neurological development to sense pain. \n\"They can't tell what it is,\" Lawrence said. \"If you can't interpret it, it can't hurt.\" \nRep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., called the measure the GOP's latest attempt \"to pass off political posturing as proven science.\" \nShe also contrasted the bill with Republican efforts to cut aid for children and food stamps, saying: \"Pure hypocrisy. We love it until it's born, then it's somebody else's problem.\" \nThe measure would make it a crime for anyone to perform most abortions on fetuses believed to be 20 weeks into development. Violators could face five years in prison. \nExceptions would be made to save the mother's life and for incest and rapes reported to government authorities. \nAbortions after 20 weeks are rare. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, of over 664,000 reported abortions in 2013, just 1.3 percent occurred at least 21 weeks into development. \nThe Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973 but opened the door to some state restrictions. Forty-three states bar some abortions at certain points during pregnancies, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that favors abortion rights.

Will It Put Them Over the Top? by Mark Murray advertisement \nRalph Northam, the Democratic nominee for governor in Virginia, is hoping that President Donald Trump puts him over the top \u2014 by voicing his opposition. \nThis week, Northam\u2019s campaign released a TV ad directly tying his Republican opponent, Ed Gillespie, to Trump, whose job-approval rating in the state is stuck in the 30s and low 40s, according to polls in the race. \n\u201cIf Donald Trump is helping Virginia, I\u2019ll work with him,\u201d Northam says to the camera. \u201cBut Donald Trump proposed cutting Virginia\u2019s school funding, rolling back our clean air and water protections, and taking away health care from thousands of Virginians.\u201d \nNortham closes, \u201cAs a candidate for governor, I sponsored this ad because I\u2019ve stood up to Donald Trump on all of it. Ed Gillespie refuses to stand up to him at all.\u201d \nIt\u2019s the second recent Northam ad that has mentioned Trump. \u201cNow \u2018Enron Ed\u2019 is lobbying for Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, like cuts to Virginia\u2019s school funding and taking away health care from thousands of Virginians,\u201d the earlier ad said . \nThese advertisements come after Northam\u2019s two-word description of Trump \u2014 \u201cnarcissistic maniac\u201d \u2014 was one reason he defeated Tom Perriello in Virginia\u2019s Democratic primary in June. (Perriello had made his opposition to Trump one of his top issues, but Northam co-opted him with his \u201cnarcissistic maniac\u201d line.) \nMaybe the most important question in the race, with a month before the Nov. 7 election, is whether Northam's latest messaging against Trump and Gillespie will make a difference in what has been polling as a close race. \nPolls show that the president is definitely a weak link for Republicans in Virginia, a state Trump lost to Hillary Clinton by 5 percentage points in 2016. \nA recent Monmouth University poll , which showed Northam leading Gillespie by 5 points among likely voters, had Trump\u2019s job approval rating at 40 percent in the state. \nPerhaps more important, the president\u2019s approval rating among undecided voters and those preferring a third-party candidate was 10 points lower in that poll \u2014 30 percent. \nAnother poll, from Quinnipiac University , showed Trump\u2019s job approval at just 32 percent among independent voters in Virginia, suggesting that the persuadable middle in the state is largely opposed to the president. \nThe Northam campaign tells NBC News that tying Trump and Gillespie to specific policies, like education and health care, is more effective than just stating opposition to the Republican president. \nBut Gillespie spokesperson David Abrams responded to the ad, asking, \"at this point what, exactly, is Ralph Northam running on? He changes his positions daily, doesn\u2019t put forward any real policy proposals, and is largely invisible on the trail. It\u2019s becoming a Seinfeld episode: A campaign about nothing.\" \nIn their first debate in July, Gillespie asked Northam how he would work with President Trump given his anti-Trump rhetoric. \n\u201cWe need to have a governor who can work with the president, the vice president, the administration,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cWhat are you going to do as our governor? Call the White House and say, \u2018Please put me through to the narcissistic maniac?\u2019\u201d \nIn their second debate, moderated by NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd, Northam answered, \u201cIf we can build up the military in this country, then I will do everything that I can to work with our president.\u201d \n\"But there are some things that bother me, that are very detrimental to the commonwealth of Virginia,\" Northam added. \"The first was the travel ban. ... My opponent supported the travel ban.\" \nWhen Todd asked Gillespie if he wanted Trump to campaign for him, Gillespie responded: \u201cI\u2019ll take help from anybody, anywhere. This is going to be a very close race.\u201d \nIf Northam wins next month, Democrats will see opposition to Trump as a successful strategy for next year\u2019s midterm races, particularly in Democratic-leaning states like Virginia. \nBut if Gillespie is elected, Republicans will have a playbook on how to win \u2014 even when their president isn\u2019t popular.

Only Kennedy Knows.", "text": "Oct 3 2017, 5:34 pm ET Kennedy Is Key to Supreme Court Decision on Gerrymandering by Associated Press advertisement \nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a case that could reshape American politics, the Supreme Court appeared split Tuesday on whether Wisconsin Republicans gave themselves an unfair advantage when they drew political maps to last a decade. \nIf Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose vote almost certainly controls the outcome, is prepared to join his liberal colleagues, the court could rule for the first time that districting plans that entrench one party's control of a legislature or congressional delegation can violate the constitutional rights of the other party's voters. That could lead to changes in political maps across the country. \nWhile both parties seek maximum partisan advantage when they can, Republicans controlled more state governments after the 2010 census and aggressively used redistricting to lock in electoral advantages to last for the next 10 years. U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy is seen at the White House April 10, 2017 in Washington. Eric Thayer / Getty Images file \nKennedy suggested, as he did in another redistricting case 13 years ago, that courts perhaps could be involved in placing limits on extremely partisan electoral maps. \nBut he did not tip his hand about whether the Wisconsin map that favors Republicans crossed a constitutional line. \nThroughout the session, the justices and lawyers alike appeared to cast their questions and remarks with the hope of attracting Kennedy. He wrote in 2004 that he would be open to ruling for the challengers if the court could be shown a good way to measure and manage excessively partisan districts. \nPaul Smith, the same lawyer who failed to get Kennedy's vote and thus a majority 13 years ago, said technology and data analysis had so improved since then that there are good ways to measure when one party gives itself an unfair edge in creating districts. \nWithout the court's intervention, Smith said on behalf of the Democratic voters, the next round of redistricting after the 2020 census will see far more extreme partisan maps. \n\"You are the only institution in the United States that can solve this problem just as democracy is about to get worse,\" Smith said. \n\"You paint a very dire picture,\" Justice Samuel Alito replied dryly. He seemed unpersuaded. \nThe conservative justices were skeptical about striking down the state's map or even involving courts in the inherently political process of redistricting. \nChief Justice John Roberts worried about involving the Supreme Court in a glut of partisan redistricting claims that would follow if the Wisconsin Democrats prevail. \n\"We'll have to decide in every case whether the Democrats win or the Republicans win,\" Roberts said, a scenario that he said would damage the court's credibility. \nRelated: They\u2019re Still Drawing Crazy-Looking Districts. Can\u2019t It Be Stopped? \nThe liberal justices appeared to favor the Democratic voters who challenged the Wisconsin plan. Republicans who controlled the legislature and the governor's office adopted electoral maps that have given themselves a significant advantage in the state Assembly in a state that is otherwise roughly divided between the parties. \nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that a decision upholding the Republican-drawn districts in Wisconsin would encourage one party's lawmakers to stack the deck against their opponents when they control the process and reduce the number of legitimately contested elections. \n\"What becomes of the precious right to vote?\" she asked. \nRepresenting Wisconsin, Misha Tseytlin urged the court not to succumb to the other side's \"scare tactics about what will happen next.\" \nPeople waited in line for hours for a chance to view the argument on the second day of the court's term. Roberts turned down a request for live audio of the argument.

Official totals put the death toll from Katrina at more than 1,800. \nShortly after Trump departed, Rossell\u00f3 updated the number of dead to 34 and said he believed Maria caused $90 billion in damage.

These immigrants received temporary work permits and deportation protections under an Obama administration program, but now face a frighteningly uncertain future.\nWhen Trump announced last month he was ending the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, he gave Congress six months to come up with a solution. If there is no action by early March, the immigrants' work permits will begin to expire and they will become subject to deportation, said as dozens of Dreamers in orange shirts watched from the audience. The Trump Republicans say DACA is unconstitutional and argue that President Barack Obama exceeded his authority in creating it.\n\"Creating a legislative fix is the right thing to do, but there's a big caveat,\" said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who was among a small group of GOP lawmakers focused on the issue who dined with Trump at the White House on Monday night.\n\"Before we provide legal status to these young people, we must reassure and actually regain the public confidence that we're serious when it comes to enforcing the law and securing our border,\" Cornyn said.\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat whose home state of California is home to large numbers of Dreamers, countered that \"these youths should not be political footballs.\"\n\"These young people have put their trust in the federal government and they have done everything asked of them,\" she said. \"They are counting on us to put aside partisanship and find a solution to this problem.\"\nCongressional Democratic leaders, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, announced an agreement with Trump last month to enshrine the DACA protections in law, while separately addressing the issue of Trump's promised border wall. But the terms of the deal quickly came into dispute with Republicans denying there was one at all.\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa opened the hearing saying a compromise was in reach, but any plan \"has to include robust border security, and by that, I don't mean a wall.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck grassley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dianne feinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cornyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john cornyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congressional democratic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T05:12:02.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d029826bae2944803cddec00c4460de91f86054", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR93qbSsuKmhHiLKTqP7yZw9vO_z2_p3XcX9Uiq9nrV7F5TRH6fMKY9V_MLrCLPzgiqWPKezl1.SquHqCT2536PEDr._RZdavt7j1aidGRPgCkA0tpP9AqM51z8A.5gCtq6LCIc9mtz_kK1tquKs5KM", "site_full": "www.nbcnews.com", "site": "nbcnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "7 Suspended After Transgender Teen Attacked at High School - NBC News", "title_full": "7 Suspended After Transgender Teen Attacked at High School - NBC News", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.646, "main_image": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_40/2176471/171003-perez-out_cf3010d5bfd3a086ce506aea690a2b9a.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 478, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4939, "comments": 0, "shares": 4939}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8d029826bae2944803cddec00c4460de91f86054", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR93qbSsuKmhHiLKTqP7yZw9vO_z2_p3XcX9Uiq9nrV7F5TRH6fMKY9V_MLrCLPzgiqWPKezl1.SquHqCT2536PEDr._RZdavt7j1aidGRPgCkA0tpP9AqM51z8A.5gCtq6LCIc9mtz_kK1tquKs5KM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Foluke", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "7 Suspended After Transgender Teen Attacked at High School - NBC News", "text": "Oct 3 2017, 3:24 pm ET 7 Suspended After Transgender Teen Attacked at High School by Foluke Tuakli and Associated Press Share advertisement \nSeven students at a New Jersey high school have been suspended following the assault of a 14-year-old transgender student, according to school officials. \nKylie Perez was attacked last week by another student in a hallway at East Side High School in Newark.

According to the latest report by the National Science Foundation , only 2 percent of employed engineers are Hispanic women. \nTrelles was not one of those kids who grew up coding or working with technology at the age of ten. Her path to becoming an engineer has been a circuitous and difficult one, and she says she feels like an impostor sometimes because she was late to the game of computers and technology. \u201cI had no introduction to programming in high school, or college.\u201d \nShe emigrated to the U.S. from Arequipa, Peru with her parents when she was nine years old. She graduated from Cornell University in 2012 with a degree in Labor Economics, was in finance for a couple of years before she decided to start her own business. \nShe realized how little she knew about computers and coding when she tried to create a mobile app for her new dog walking business and didn\u2019t know how. \u201cI basically taught myself through a series of online courses, and community college courses,\u201d explains Trelles. \nEventually she attended a coding boot camp in San Francisco and then at 25, tried to find employment in the competitive tech world. Her job search was tough and it was when the \u201cwomen in tech\u201d issue became really evident to her. \nRELATED: Few Latinos, Minorities in Tech, But Shareholders Can Push for Change \nShe feels that if tech companies are serious about diversity in their ranks, they need to embrace programs that actually foster and support candidates of different backgrounds. \n\u201cI think the apprenticeship route is the way to go for non-traditional people and also for people who don\u2019t have a network built in for them,\" said Trelles. \"These will be game-changers for companies who really want to move the needle forward\u201d in terms of diversity. \nRachel Bird, a Java Script developer in California who is of Mexican descent, also finds that the lack of women in tech makes being in this field much harder. \n\u201cI feel like right now I am implicitly being told that I don\u2019t belong because there is no one like me in my company. Not many women like me are visible in tech. If we can have more and more women there, then we can feel that we belong there, that this is a natural path.\u201d \nBird, 34, was going to be a Philosophy major and instead ended up building apps for the Internet. She won a full-time scholarship into the Full Stack Academy engineering boot camp and has been a developer ever since. \nHer advice to other young Latinas: \u201cDo all kinds of online tutorials. There is so much stuff that is free so you can learn how to do software engineering, especially for the web. There are tons of resources,\" said Bird. \"If you like it and you like programming, then the sky is the limit.\u201d \nCecilia Arag\u00f3n, the first Latina full professor at the School of Engineering at the University of Washington, says there is a lot of work to do. \n\u201cWe have a lot more work to do,\u201d said Arag\u00f3n. \u201cIt is difficult being a Latina and a woman in a field that is predominantly white and male. But we are making inroads.\u201d Arag\u00f3n has done more than make inroads; she is a role model in the field. The recipient of multiple awards for her work in the field of Computer Science and Engineering, she's the director of the Human-Centered Data Science Lab at the University of Washington and has created a visual augmentation system for helicopter pilots. Cecilia Aragon is a professor of Human Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington's School of Engineering. \nArag\u00f3n says that what is needed is more funding specifically for Latina technologists, and increasing opportunities for one-on-one type of mentorship, which she views as increasingly vital. \n\u201cI feel this obligation to mentor younger Latinas,\u201d said Arag\u00f3n, the daughter of immigrants. \u201cThere are so many things that can be learned from talking to a more senior person in the field. I would often feel uncomfortable. Maybe I am not cut out to be a woman in technology. But then, in speaking with a senior woman it made me realize that it was not me.\u201d \nAs for the uproar over the recent Google memo, Arag\u00f3n says she was sad when news of it broke simply because she felt like these ideas had already been discredited and she hopes it does not discourage young Hispanic women to follow in her footsteps. \n\u201cIt\u2019s because there are all these subtle discriminations that build up over time\u201d, explains Aragon. \u201cYou have to keep fighting out of them. I try to encourage the young people, and I say: \u2018yes, it can be hard. Yes, you feel like you are battling the impostor syndrome over and over again. But the rewards are amazing.\u2019\u201d \nGoogle\u2019s head of Latino Community Engagement, Laura Marquez, agrees that improving diversity is \u201csomething we are laser focused on right now.\u201d \n\u201cWe have to keep at it every day. You can\u2019t take your foot off the gas pedal,\u201d admits Marquez while detailing all the new initiatives the tech giant is taking to increase the Latino tech pipeline, strengthen the broader Latino community, and improve their hiring processes. \nWith only 3 percent of Hispanics working in tech in Google overall, there is work to be done. \u201cInternally, we are working very hard at the inclusion issue,\u201d says the Latina executive. \nRELATED: \u2018Celebrating Latinidad\u2019: Google Creates Online Latino Culture Exhibit \nPrograms like The Grace Hopper Celebration and the scholarships offered by the Anita Borg Institute for Women in Technology are making a big difference in the lives of young Latina engineers. \nMore than 18,000 women in tech are expected to gather at this year\u2019s celebration in Orlando from October 4-6th. \nBlakely Hoffman was one of 25 young women to receive a scholarship last year to attend the annual conference. \u201cYou are connected with people who are ambitious,\u201d and doing amazing research, said Hoffman, whose mom grew up in a rural farm in Puerto Rico. \u201cIt opens doors,\" she said, adding that it's nice that the scholarships are able to shine a light on young talented women. \nThe Latina engineer is now a master\u2019s student at the Media lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston, where she will focus on how technology can improve cooperation and understanding between individuals and organizations. Blakely Hoffman, a Master's candidate at MIT in Boston, MA, and a former recipient of the Grace Hopper scholarship for Latina engineers. Courtesy of Mark Payne \nHoffman advises young Latina engineers not to be intimidated and to ask for help from their peers, adding that it is never too late to learn. \u201cThe work being done is hard no matter who you are.\u201d \nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

Gregory Bull / AP \nVegas food writer and stand-up comedian Jason Harris is just one local who has rallied businesses to help out: His informal food program, The First Food Responders, delivers food and meals from over a dozen different top-notch restaurants to victims, hospitals and first responders. Harris estimates they\u2019re doing about 1,000 free meals a day. \nHarris was on the famed Strip when the shooting started \u2014 and two of his friends were hit. As the numbness and shock faded he started looking for a way to help. \nPhotos Capture Chaos of Concert Massacre \n\u201cEveryone is just using their strengths; my strengths are I know a lot of these chefs and restaurants and I just started to put it together,\u201d Harris told NBC News. He gets a call on his cellphone of another hungry place and taps into his network to order up hot meals and sandwiches and get them delivered. \n\u201cIf X group needs Y food at what hour,\u201d he\u2019s there, Harris said. His group has coordinated donations from Aureole, Delmonico Steakhouse, Metro Pizza, Momofuku and more, along with nearly the entire local food truck community to bring food and lift spirits. \nRelated: A Surreal Air Settles on the Las Vegas Strip \nThe famously hospitable Vegas entertainment industry is also assisting, in its own way.

As diverse as they are many, the groups are viewed as a conduit between government and citizen. Members provide expert advice on issues from education to healthcare, technology to the environment. \nThe executive order carries the commissions, along with a number of other advisory committees, all the way through to Sept. 30, 2019. \nNBC News asked the White House in an email Monday whether new commissioners had been appointed, whether there was an appointment timetable, and whether Obama-era appointees would meet in the interim. \nA spokesperson responded, \u201cWe have no personnel announcements at this time.\u201d \nSeveral Obama-era commissioners told NBC News last month that the three commissions hadn\u2019t formally met since Trump was inaugurated in January. Each is associated with a White House initiative housed under the Department of Education. Commissioners are appointed by the president. \nSince Trump\u2019s swearing in, new executive directors have not been named to any of the three commissions, though each initiative continues to exist and operate with staff members in place. In February, two-thirds of the AAPI commission resigned in protest of Trump's policies. \nAll three White House initiatives were established during previous administrations. Their associated commissions have been tasked with a number of responsibilities, among them making recommendations on how to close the student achievement gap and preparing briefs on issues like immigration and improving language access to federal programs. \nThe president, after receiving recommendations, reports to Congress how he\u2019ll respond or why he won\u2019t take action. \n\u201cI would hope that [the Trump administration] would appoint similar individuals who are experienced, thoughtful, and really have the interests of these communities at heart \u2014 and listen to them,\u201d G\u00e1ndara said.

Kenya passed a law calling for fines of up to $40,000 and four-year prison sentences for the use of plastic bags.\nMeanwhile on Bali, which is part of Indonesia, two sisters convinced the island\u2019s governor to ban plastic bags by 2018.\n\u201cEvery day you wake up there is a new city or country that is actually taking this matter very seriously and actually banning plastic,\u201d Kumala said.\nFollow ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/nbcasianamerica", "http://www.instagram.com/nbcasianamerica", "http://www.twitter.com/nbcasianamerica", "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-09/01/c_136574378.htm", "https://www.ted.com/talks/melati_and_isabel_wijsen_our_campaign_to_ban_plastic_bags_in_bali", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/28/kenya-brings-in-worlds-toughest-plastic-bag-ban-four-years-jail-or-40000-fine", "https://instagram.com/p/BZfMrUGjEZb/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "avani eco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kumala", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nbc news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "avani eco", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sri lanka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T09:33:13.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "747971db0ab8d951df537c519fd9bef89f38b5a4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR93qbSsuKmhHiLKTqP7yZwEq1lwG87yMs80qovcP54QPKonIomLf29vngfTqRP3e_CAgchaMz5i.cZP4DhdUQeZ3.wR0zE.wS12DOafaiK8a7G6iwACWHJAmKuOpHZNTdIfIakBwsGPlYbKYNC8pIl_7IsqYPpFnQ-", "site_full": "www.nbcnews.com", "site": "nbcnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "Marilou Danley, Girlfriend of Las Vegas Gunman, Arrives in U.S., Sources Say - NBC News", "title_full": "Marilou Danley, Girlfriend of Las Vegas Gunman, Arrives in U.S., Sources Say - NBC News", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.46, "main_image": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_40/2177131/171004-marilou-danley-lax-rd-130a_07756224f75b246acfac9b5f9510a07a.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 478, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4165, "comments": 0, "shares": 4165}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "747971db0ab8d951df537c519fd9bef89f38b5a4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR93qbSsuKmhHiLKTqP7yZwEq1lwG87yMs80qovcP54QPKonIomLf29vngfTqRP3e_CAgchaMz5i.cZP4DhdUQeZ3.wR0zE.wS12DOafaiK8a7G6iwACWHJAmKuOpHZNTdIfIakBwsGPlYbKYNC8pIl_7IsqYPpFnQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Andrew Blankstein", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Marilou Danley, Girlfriend of Las Vegas Gunman, Arrives in U.S., Sources Say - NBC News", "text": "Girlfriend of Las Vegas Shooter Arrives in Los Angeles 0:27 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/1061487683643\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \nAlso troubling, investigators found ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer, in the trunk of the car Paddock had parked at Mandalay Bay, officials said.

I'd say 'How did it go?' and he would say 'I just dropped 20 grand' or 'I'm up 86 grand.' He approached it like a business.\" \nLe Fevre described the shooter as \"a very reserved and nonemotive person.\" \n\"His investments, his gambling were done with military precision,\" Le Favre added. Stephen Paddock U.S. Government / via NBC News \nSeparately, a worker at a Starbucks in Mesquite told The Los Angeles Times that she and her colleagues winced whenever the couple came in because Paddock would frequently berate his much shorter partner in public. \n\"He was so rude to her in front of us,\" Esperanza Mendoza, the store's supervisor, told the newspaper. \"He would glare down at her and say \u2014 with a mean attitude \u2014 'You don't need my casino card for this. I'm paying for your drink, just like I'm paying for you.' Then she would softly say, 'OK,' and step back behind him.\" \nHer sister said that Danley, who moved to the United States in 1989, would most likely have stopped Sunday's massacre if she had been there, adding that Danley was \"in love\" with Paddock. \n\"No one can put the puzzles together,\" she said. \"No one except Marilou.

And you thought you knew the person yourself. \nHer other sister added: \"She is a good person and a gentle soul \u2026 a mother, grandmother, a sister, a friend.\" \nThe sisters asked for privacy, saying they would not be giving further interviews.

Last Friday Trump accepted the resignation of Tom Price, the Health and Human Services secretary. \nOne senior administration official described late July as \u201ca tough period of time\u201d for Tillerson. His frustrations appeared to mount in the preceding weeks. Trump publicly undermined Tillerson in June over a dispute between Qatar and other Persian Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Tillerson had called on the countries to ease their blockade of Qatar, yet just hours later Trump said the Saudi-led effort was necessary. \nTillerson also pushed Trump to certify in July that Iran was complying with the 2015 nuclear deal. \nTillerson has been at odds with Trump on other issues as well, arguing against sanctions on Venezuela and reportedly suggesting Israel return to the U.S. $75 million in aid. Tillerson also is seeking to use the implementation of arms deals Trump struck with Saudi Arabia and the UAE as leverage to prod the two countries to resolve the dispute with Qatar, according to U.S. and Arab officials. \nAdministration officials speculate that Tillerson would be succeeded by Haley if Tillerson were to depart. \nTillerson\u2019s tenure has been rocky from the start. He was confirmed by a Republican-led Senate on 56-to-43 vote. That represents the most votes against a secretary of state in Senate history. \nSince then, Tillerson, the former chief executive of ExxonMobil, has been slow to fill jobs within his department and appears to have alienated officials in the White House, the Cabinet and Congress. \nHe has become known for being difficult to reach and tends to take his time returning phone calls, administration and congressional officials said. Congressional Republicans balked at his proposed cuts to the State Department budget. \n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get him to return phone calls,\u201d a senior Republican congressional aide said of Tillerson. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get him to answer letters.\u201d \nHammond said Tillerson is quick to return calls and respond to lawmakers. \nTillerson has clashed with the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who has a broad portfolio that includes policies in the Middle East, officials said. \nA second White House official downplayed any tensions between Tillerson and Kushner, noting that Kushner\u2019s efforts on an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement are run through the relevant agencies and that a State Department representative went on his most recent trip to the region. \nA third White House official disputed the notion that Tillerson has alienated people in the White House, Cabinet and Congress. \nTrump\u2019s July 24 speech at the Boy Scouts gathering struck a political tone unusual for the event, with the president talking about his electoral victory and the \u201ccesspool\u201d of Washington. He also joked about firing his Health and Human Services secretary if congressional Republicans didn\u2019t pass a health care bill. The head of the Boy Scouts later apologized for the political tone of the speech. \nTillerson is an Eagle Scout and a former president of the Boy Scouts. He had appeared at the gathering just three days before Trump. Hammond, his spokesman, said Tillerson was not upset with Trump\u2019s speech. He said Tillerson told him that at the end of the day the scouts are going to remember that the president came to speak at their event, and their parents can answer any questions they might have about the message he delivered. \nIt\u2019s unclear if the latest disagreement between the White House and Tillerson on North Korea spells an end to the late-July reset. \nNicholas Burns, former undersecretary of state for political affairs under President George W. Bush, said Trump \u201ccompletely undercut Tillerson\u201d with his tweets. \n\u201cThis was a direct public, I thought, repudiation of what Tillerson said,\u201d Burns said. \u201cIt feeds the perception that Tillerson does not have a trusting relationship with the president, and that\u2019s very harmful.\u201d Carol E.

We put wheelchairs outside waiting for the people to be brought in. And we had doctors, physician assistants, nurses outside, triaging the minute they got there,\" she said. \nAll of the assistance was needed: Patients were arriving by the truckload. Mullan said her daughter, who also works for the hospital, pulled patients out of trucks that had \"eight people in the back of them.\" \nLas Vegas Shooting: Photos Capture Chaos of Concert Massacre \nAs a Level I trauma center, the hospital is accustomed to treating multiple victims, Mullan said. \n\"This is what we do, on a higher level. And what we do is you need to think about who needs the immediate care,\" she said. \nFor those not in emergency medicine, the scene may have looked disorganized, she added. But every administrator was there, and the hospital had about 100 volunteers in the trauma center to keep things running smoothly, she said. \n\"There are no words for someone who is an outsider to understand what it looks like when you have people all over the place, wanting pain medications, needing to be intubated, needing to have chest tubes, finding their loved ones \u2014 they're not IDed \u2014 trying to make sure we're putting them in the right place,\" Mullan said. People carry a wounded person at the scene of a mass shooting Sunday in Las Vegas. David Becker / Getty Images \nMass casualty training happens regularly at medical facilities across the country, said Ian Weston, executive director of the American Trauma Society, which represents and lobbies for advanced trauma programs. While training varies from facility to facility, it usually offers models and response guidelines for every type of scenario. \n\"In cases like Las Vegas, they were able to call in additional staffing, ranging from your clinician all the way down to the folks that help turn rooms around for cleaning, custodial staff, so they're able to operate at quite a high capacity,\" Weston said. \"They're able to accommodate 100-plus patients at once and turn rooms around and get people into surgery as quickly as possible.\" \nFacilities prepare for both external emergencies and internal ones, such as an active shooter inside the hospital, which would force staff to move their operations outside the building, Weston said. \nDr. John Fildes, medical director of the trauma department at University Medical Center, said the facility conducts two mass casualty drills a year, as well as drills for two internal mass casualty incidents two more times a year. Sunday's shooting incorporated many of the training lessons, he said. A wounded woman is moved outside the Tropicana on the Las Vegas Strip on Sunday. Chase Stevens / Las Vegas Review-Journal via AP \n\"The majority of these were high-velocity gunshot wounds, but there were a lot of people who were fleeing the scene, so we even had people who were hit by cars or people who fell and were injured, so there's a variety of things going on,\" Fildes said. \nBut there's one thing experience and training never quite prepare medical staff for, Mullan said: the heartbreak of a patient dying. \n\"I'm alive,\" she said. \"There are people who aren't going to have their loved ones tonight.\" \nMiguel Almaguer reported from Las Vegas.
