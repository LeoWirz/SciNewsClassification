Each year, more than 400 people in the United States die from accidental CO poisoning. \nIf you're using a generator or any gasoline-powered engine, place it at least 20 feet away from your home. Never use a generator, pressure washer or any gasoline-powered engine inside your home, basement or garage, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. \nWhen using a generator, also use a battery-powered or battery backup CO detector. If you have a professionally installed and vented generator system, keep vents and flues free of debris, especially if there are strong winds. Flying debris can block ventilation lines. \nNever use a gas range or oven to heat a home, and never leave the motor running in a vehicle parked in an enclosed or partially enclosed space, such as a garage. \nIf you suspect carbon monoxide poisoning, get outside for fresh air, call 911 or your local Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222, or seek medical care immediately, the CDC said. \n-- Robert Preidt   SOURCE: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, news release Next Article: How Much Alcohol Is Really OK?

Latest Exercise & Fitness News \nIt doesn't have to be that way, says the American Podiatric Medical Association. \nHere are the group's suggestions for running outdoors once the weather turns colder: Wear warm, light-weight, moisture-wicking clothing -- including hat and gloves -- to keep yourself warm and dry. Shorten your stride to increase your stability and help prevent slipping on ice. Stretch before and after every run to make sure your muscles are warmed up. Don't wear summer-appropriate footwear in winter. Examples include flip-flops and sandals. If your kids are runners, don't buy shoes or boots that are too large, thinking you'll get more than one season out of them. Footwear should always fit properly from the get-go.

Latest Sexual Health News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nOxytocin promotes socialization by triggering pleasurable feelings when people get together, said Stanford University researchers. \n\"Our study reveals new insights about the brain circuitry behind social reward, the positive experience you often get when you run into an old friend or meet somebody you like,\" said study senior author Dr. Robert Malenka. He's associate chair of psychiatry and behavioral science at Stanford's School of Medicine. \n\"The reward circuitry is crucial to our survival because it rewards us for doing things that have, during our evolutionary history, tended to enhance our survival, our reproduction and the survival of our resulting offspring,\" he explained in a university news release. \nFor example, when you're hungry, food tastes great, he pointed out. \"When you're thirsty, water is refreshing. Sex is great pretty much most of the time,\" he added. \nHanging out with friends has historically conferred a survival advantage, too, by decreasing the odds of getting eaten by predators, increasing chances of finding a mate and maybe helping to learn where food and water are, Malenka said. \nHe and his colleagues conducted a series of lab experiments that examined oxycontin 's role in social behavior. Their findings were published Sept. 29 in the journal Science . \nThe findings could lead to new ways to help people who have difficulty socializing, including those with autism and schizophrenia , according to the researchers. \n-- Robert Preidt   SOURCE: Stanford University, news release, Sept. 28, 2017 Next Article: STDs Hit All-Time High in U.S.   General Health Newsletter  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert malenka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malenka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert preidt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "stanford university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford's school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T22:05:47.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a37c5a8d665649ee861e8c33737c855b7a50d97", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_xTOf3KHrB90CjNWmDIijDa1A9a8ZE8tOUAPrjke.sd0_PTlok0wQ_M3W.kgcVDKkuPgXIDhcpDLwQU5NELC5J", "site_full": "www.medicinenet.com", "site": "medicinenet.com", "site_section": "http://www.medicinenet.com/rss/dailyhealth.xml", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "MedicineNet Daily News", "title": "Makers of Quick-Release Opioid Painkillers Must Provide Doctor Training", "title_full": "Makers of Quick-Release Opioid Painkillers Must Provide Doctor Training", "published": "2017-10-03T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.medicinenet.com/images/facebook/medicinenet/fb-mnet-default.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1836, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a37c5a8d665649ee861e8c33737c855b7a50d97", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_xTOf3KHrB90CjNWmDIijDa1A9a8ZE8tOUAPrjke.sd0_PTlok0wQ_M3W.kgcVDKkuPgXIDhcpDLwQU5NELC5J", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Makers of Quick-Release Opioid Painkillers Must Provide Doctor Training", "text": "Want More News?

By Julie Davis HealthDay Reporter \nMONDAY, Oct. 2, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- All the good news/bad news studies about alcohol can leave you confused. But research suggests that you still need to keep moderation in mind when you raise a glass. Latest Prevention & Wellness News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nYou may have heard reports about red wine in particular, and the suggestion that it can boost health, especially heart health, because of its antioxidant resveratrol. According to a round-up of studies published in Consumer Reports , moderate amounts of red wine may confer some benefits, but any pluses rapidly change to risks for heavy drinkers. \nA research review about overall alcohol consumption, published in 2016 in the journal Circulation , confirmed that the picture is rather complex -- there can be some immediate health threats from drinking any type of alcohol, even in moderate amounts. \nThere's little doubt that alcohol's risks increase with quantity. The World Health Organization warns that alcohol is a factor in more than 200 types of medical conditions. And about 25 percent of deaths in people aged 20 to 39 are linked to alcohol. \nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer calls alcohol a carcinogen, associating it with cancers of the head and neck, esophagus , liver and breast. The more you drink and the more regularly you drink over time, the higher your risk of developing an alcohol-associated cancer . In the United States, alcohol use accounts for about 3.5 percent of all cancer deaths every year, researchers estimate. \nExperts say that if you're not a drinker, there aren't any health-related reasons for you to start. If you do drink, it's best to stay within the guidelines for moderate drinking, though there's no 100 percent safe level. \nFor women, moderate means one drink a day; for men, two drinks . One drink is equal to 5 ounces of wine or a 12-ounce beer or one shot (1.5 ounce) of an 80-proof liquor.   Next Article: Is Older Blood OK to Use in a Transfusion?

Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nMONDAY, Oct. 2, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Millions of cigarette smokers could live substantially longer if electronic cigarettes are embraced as a replacement for tobacco during the next decade, a new study contends. \nAs many as 6.6 million cigarette smokers could live a combined 86.7 million more years under policies that encourage them to swap their smokes for e-cigarettes , according to \"optimistic\" projections from cancer researchers at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. \nEven a worst-case scenario involving e-cigarettes would still save lives, the researchers said. \nUnder a \"pessimistic\" projection, 1.6 million former cigarette smokers would have a combined 20.8 million more years of additional life, the research team found. \nThese numbers show that adopting e-cigarettes as an alternative to smoking could prove the easiest way to cause tobacco use to dwindle in the United States, said lead researcher David Levy, a professor of oncology at Georgetown's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center. \n\"An e-cigarette strategy really could help us move towards the goal that we all have, to reduce cigarette use,\" Levy said. \"Everybody agrees that cigarettes are really harmful, and population health could be dramatically improved.\" \nPeople using e-cigarettes are not exposed to the carcinogens and chemicals produced by burning tobacco, although they still endure the addictive and systemic effects of nicotine , Levy said. \nHowever, the vapor-emitting, battery-powered devices remain unregulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This makes it tough for tobacco control advocates to adopt a pragmatic strategy focused on the devices, said Dr. Louis DePalo, a professor of pulmonology with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \nFDA-approved nicotine replacement products such as gum or patches are considered safe and are used alongside counseling and therapy to help people kick their addiction , DePalo said. Gum and patches also aren't as pleasurable as using an e-cigarette, and that enjoyment might make it more difficult for someone to wean themselves off e-cigarettes. \n\"E-cigarettes in an unregulated environment just don't offer you the exit strategy of being part of a comprehensive smoking cessation strategy,\" said DePalo, who had no role in the new study. \nFor the study, Levy and his colleagues crafted optimistic and pessimistic scenarios under which smokers start adopting e-cigarettes, and then projected out how many lives would be saved and extended under those scenarios. \nThe optimistic scenario assumes that: Cigarette smoking would decline to 5 percent of the U.S. population as e-cigarettes become the more popular option, down from the current 16 percent. New smokers would take up e-cigarettes rather than tobacco. People would quit e-cigarettes at about the same rate they quit tobacco. E-cigarettes carry 5 percent of the health risk of tobacco cigarettes. \nThe pessimistic scenario paints a somewhat darker picture, as expected. It assumes that: About 10 percent of Americans would still smoke tobacco; more never-smokers would take up e-cigarettes. Vapers would quit at half the rate of smokers. E-cigarettes carry about 40 percent of the risk of smoking . \nThis less-rosy outlook reflects some of the recent science regarding e-cigarettes. \nFor example, a September study in the Journal of the American Heart Association linked the nicotine in e-cigarettes to adrenaline level spikes that could increase the risk of heart attack . Also, a study in JAMA Pediatrics estimated that teens and young adults who use e-cigarettes are nearly four times more likely to graduate to full-fledged tobacco smoking . \nNevertheless, both scenarios predicted that millions of former smokers would live many more years thanks to e-cigarettes. \n\"What the scientists have discovered is it's not the nicotine that causes nearly all the deaths,\" Levy said. \"It's all the other stuff in cigarettes that people inhale.\" \nFDA regulation of e-cigarettes could pave the way to the devices becoming a more accepted form of nicotine replacement, Levy and DePalo said. \n\"The FDA has begun to look very seriously at an e-cigarette strategy,\" Levy said. \"The FDA commissioner explicitly stated about two months ago that e-cigs will be a prime component of tobacco control strategies here on.\" \nBut DePalo worries that such a strategy might imply that continued nicotine addiction is acceptable compared to the hazards of smoking , unless more is done to help e-cigarette users eventually wean themselves off the devices. \n\"As a pulmonologist, the idea that tobacco could be outlawed is so appealing to me,\" DePalo said. \"That's what we all want. The question is, would we be making a deal with the devil regarding e-cigarettes? If they were regulated by the FDA, maybe that deal is one we want to make.\" \nThe new study was published Oct. 2 in the journal Tobacco Control . Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

By Amy Norton HealthDay Reporter \nMONDAY, Oct. 2, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Middle-aged adults who routinely skip breakfast are more likely to have clogged heart arteries than those who enjoy a big morning meal, a new study finds. Latest Heart News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nThe findings are the latest to link breakfast to better heart health. \nThey suggest that people who eat breakfast -- especially a hearty one -- are less likely to harbor plaques in their arteries. \nPlaques are deposits of fat, calcium and other substances that can build up in arteries, causing them to harden and narrow -- a condition called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis can lead to heart attacks , strokes and other complications. \nThe new study does not prove that skipping breakfast directly harms people's arteries. \n\"It's not that you skip breakfast, you get plaques,\" said senior researcher Jose Penalvo, of Tufts University's Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy in Boston. \nBut, he said, there are several reasons that forgoing the morning meal could contribute to the risk of atherosclerosis. \nFor many people, skipping breakfast is part of a \"cluster\" of bad habits, said Penalvo. These people tend to eat out a lot, and opt for nutritionally dubious convenience foods, for instance. \nOn top of that, Penalvo said, skipping breakfast may have negative effects on appetite-regulating hormones, blood sugar and insulin (a hormone that regulates blood sugar ). \nPrior studies have shown that breakfast fans are less likely to be obese or have diabetes or heart disease . \nBut the current study actually used objective tests, Penalvo said. The researchers used ultrasound to screen middle-aged adults for \"subclinical\" atherosclerosis -- early plaque buildup that is not causing any symptoms. \nThe study included more than 4,000 adults ages 40 to 54 from Spain. Three percent were chronic breakfast-skippers, while 27 percent regularly had a big breakfast. That meant they ate more than 20 percent of their daily calories at their morning meal. \nMost people -- 70 percent -- ate a relatively low-calorie breakfast. \nIt turned out that those three groups also differed in their odds of subclinical atherosclerosis. \nNearly 75 percent of breakfast-skippers showed such plaque buildup. That compared with 57 percent of people who ate a big breakfast, and 64 percent of those who favored a light one. \nBreakfast fans were healthier in many ways, the study found. They generally ate more fruits and vegetables, seafood and lean meat, for instance. They were also less likely to be obese or have high blood pressure , diabetes or unhealthy cholesterol levels . \nBut even with all those factors weighed, breakfast-skipping, itself, was still tied to a higher risk of atherosclerosis. \nKim Larson is a registered dietitian and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \nShe said the findings are important, in part, because many adults -- around 30 percent -- routinely skip breakfast. \nAnd some people, she noted, purposely cut out breakfast when they're trying to lose weight . \nThat's a bad idea, Larson explained, because of the effects on appetite and eating habits the rest of the day. \n\"People who skip breakfast generally make up for it later in the day,\" said Larson, who wasn't involved in the study. In the end, she said, they typically down more calories over the course of the day, versus people who eat breakfast. \nThe current study did not dig into the nutritional quality of people's breakfast choices. But when it comes to preventing disease, Larson said, \"quality matters.\" \nA bagel and coffee is \"better than nothing,\" she noted. However, Larson recommended that breakfast include a healthy mix of protein, carbohydrates and fat. \nShe acknowledged that time is an obstacle. Many people are rushed in the morning and end up eating a muffin in the car. \nBut breakfast does not need to be extravagant to be healthy, Larson said. Some of her suggestions: oatmeal with nuts and fruit; whole-grain toast with nut butter; granola mixed with yogurt and fruit; and apple slices with peanut butter. \nPenalvo encouraged people to look at it this way: Eating a healthy breakfast is actually an enjoyable way to potentially curb your heart disease risk. \n\"This is a really positive message,\" he said. \nOf course, breakfast is not a stand-alone solution. Penalvo said it should be part of a generally healthy diet and other good habits such as regular exercise . \nThe findings were published Oct. 2 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology .

According to CBS News , Petty was found unconscious and not breathing and died later at the hospital. Latest Heart News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nHis death was confirmed in a statement released Monday night by his longtime manager, who said Petty died \"surrounded by family, his bandmates and friends.\" \nPetty and his band broke into fame in the 1970s and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. They garnered legions of fans and continued to tour over the past four decades. \nPetty's last show was at the Hollywood Bowl last Monday, where he and the Heartbreakers played three sold-out performances to end their 40th anniversary tour. \nSpeaking in December to Rolling Stone , Petty seemed unsure of how long the band's hectic touring pace could last. \n\"It's very likely we'll keep playing, but will we take on 50 shows in one tour? I don't think so,\" he said. \"I'd be lying if I didn't say I was thinking this might be the last big one. We're all on the backside of our sixties. I have a granddaughter now I'd like to see as much as I can. I don't want to spend my life on the road. This tour will take me away for four months. With a little kid, that's a lot of time.\" \nBesides his work with the Heartbreakers, Petty released three solo albums and was also a member of the 80s supergroup the Traveling Wilburys, teaming up with Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Roy Orbison and Jeff Lynne. \nPetty also had his own Sirius XM channel, complete with an interview show dubbed \"Tom Talks to Cool People,\" where he chatted with other music legends.

She completed residency training in Anatomic Pathology at Georgetown University followed by subspecialty fellowship training in molecular diagnostics and experimental pathology. \nHow do melanomas form? Doctor's response \nA changing skin spot may be a problem, but not every change means cancer . A mole may appear and then get bigger or become raised but still be only a mole. It is normal for many moles to start flat and dark, become raised and dark, and then later lose much of their color. This process takes many years. \nMost public-health information about melanoma stresses the so-called ABCDE s: A symmetry: One half of the mole is different from the other half. B order irregularity: The spot has borders which are not smooth and regular but uneven or notched. C olor: The spot has several colors in an irregular pattern or is a very different color than the rest of one's moles . D iameter: The spot is larger than the size of a pencil eraser (6 mm). E volving: The mole is changing in size, shape, color, or overall texture. This may also include new bleeding. \nThese guidelines are somewhat helpful, but the problem is that many normal moles and other benign lesions of the skin are not completely symmetrical in their shape or color. This means that many spots, which seem to have one or more of the ABCDEs, are in fact just ordinary moles and not melanomas. Additionally, some melanomas do not fit this description but may still be spotted by a primary-care physician or dermatologist. Not all melanomas have color or are raised on the skin. Amelanotic melanomas have little or no color to the naked eye and may be confused with traumatized benign nevi or basal cell carcinoma . Desmoplastic melanoma may appear to be a thickened area of skin like a scar . These are treated the same way as more typical melanomas but, in the latter case, may be more difficult to determine the exact margins of the tumor . \nAs a rule, melanoma is not painful unless traumatized. They sometimes itch , but this has no diagnostic or prognostic importance. \nThe more rapid and dramatic the skin change, the less serious the problem. \nWhen changes such as pain , swelling, or even bleeding come on rapidly, within a day or two, they are likely to be caused by minor trauma , often a kind one doesn't remember (like scratching the spot while sleeping). If a spot changes rapidly and then goes back to the way it was within a couple of weeks, or falls off altogether, it is not likely to represent anything serious. Nevertheless, this would be a good time to say once again: Nobody can diagnose him- or herself. If one sees a spot that looks as though it is new or changing, show it to a doctor. If one see a spot that doesn't look like one's other spots, it should be evaluated. How can people estimate their level of risk for melanoma? \nIndividual sunburns do raise one's risk of melanoma. However, slow daily sun exposure, even without burning, may also substantially raise someone's risk of skin cancer . \nFactors that raise one's risk for melanoma include the following: Caucasian (white) ancestry Fair skin, light hair, and light-colored eyes A history of intense, intermittent sun exposure, especially in childhood Many (more than 100) moles Large, irregular, or \"funny looking\" moles Close blood relatives -- parents, siblings, and children -- with melanoma \nThe presence of close (first-degree) family with melanoma is a high risk factor, although looking at all cases of melanoma, only 10% of cases run in families. \nHaving a history of other sun-induced skin cancers , such as the much more common basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas, indirectly raises one's risk of melanoma because they are markers of long-term sun exposure. The basic cell type is different, however, and a basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma cannot \"turn into melanoma\" or vice versa. \nThe best way to know one's risk level is to have a dermatologist perform a full body examination. That way one will find out whether the spots one has are moles and, if so, whether they are abnormal in the medical sense. \nThe medical term for such moles is atypical . This is a somewhat confusing term, because among other things the criteria for defining it are not clear, and it's not certain that an atypical mole is necessarily precancerous . Patients who have lots of \" atypical moles \" (more than 24) do have a higher risk for developing melanoma but not necessarily within one of their existing funny-looking moles. It may be a challenge to find the \"baby melanoma\" in the middle of a back full of large, dark, or irregular moles. If someone has such moles, a doctor will recommend regular surveillance and may recommend biopsy of the most unusual or worrisome looking moles. \nSometimes, one learns at a routine skin evaluation that one does not necessarily need annual routine checkups. In other situations, a doctor may recommend regular checks at 6-month or yearly intervals. \nFor more information, read our full medical article on melanoma symptoms, treatment, staging, and prognosis.

Although it accounts for only 1.2% of all cancers in males, cancer of the testis accounts for about 11%-13% of all cancer deaths of men between the ages of 15-35. \nTesticular cancer has two peaks according to age. The first peak occurs before the age of 45 and accounts for about 90% of cases of testicular cancer. A second much smaller peak affects men over 50. What are the possible signs and symptoms of testicular cancer? \nTesticular cancers are often (90%-95%) curable even if they are metastatic. \nThe first and early sign of testicular cancer is most commonly a little (\"pea-sized\") lump on the testis (painless testicular lump). There may be no real pain , at most just a dull ache in the lower abdomen or groin, perhaps a sensation of dragging and heaviness. The signs and symptoms of cancer of the testicle may include... a lump in or on a testicle (testicular lump) is the most common sign; any enlargement or swelling of a testicle and/or scrotum; shrinking of a testicle; a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum (scrotal heaviness); a dull ache in the lower abdomen (lower abdominal pain ) or in the groin (groin ache); a collection of fluid in the scrotum; discomfort or pain in a testicle or in the scrotum; enlargement or tenderness of the breasts; lower back pain due to retroperitoneal disease spread; and enlarged or swollen lymph nodes or masses due to disease spread. \nThe best hope for early detection of testicular cancer is a simple three-minute self-examination once a month. The ideal time for this exam is after a warm bath or shower, when the scrotal skin is most relaxed. \nGently roll each testicle between the thumb and fingers of both hands. If any hard lumps or nodules are felt, a man should see a doctor promptly. A lump may not be malignant , but only a doctor can make the diagnosis.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T09:34:36.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6dbd24b5e6af356411d08250e1044533a52b5cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_xTOf3KHrB90CjNWmDIijDa1A9a8ZE8tOUAPrjke.sd0_PTlok0wQ_M3W.kgcVDKk4fJF7u01jSw--", "site_full": "www.medicinenet.com", "site": "medicinenet.com", "site_section": "http://www.medicinenet.com/rss/dailyword.xml", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "MedTerms Word of the Day", "title": "Vagus nerve", "title_full": "Vagus nerve", "published": "2017-10-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.medicinenet.com/images/facebook/medicinenet/fb-mnet-default.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1836, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6dbd24b5e6af356411d08250e1044533a52b5cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_xTOf3KHrB90CjNWmDIijDa1A9a8ZE8tOUAPrjke.sd0_PTlok0wQ_M3W.kgcVDKk4fJF7u01jSw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Vagus nerve", "text": "Brain Foods Slideshow Medical Definition of Vagus nerve \nVagus nerve: A nerve that supplies nerve fibers to the pharynx (throat), larynx (voice box), trachea (windpipe), lungs, heart, esophagus, and intestinal tract, as far as the transverse portion of the colon. The vagus nerve also brings sensory information back to the brain from the ear, tongue, pharynx, and larynx. The vagus nerve is the tenth cranial nerve. It originates in the medulla oblongata, a part of the brain stem, and extends all the way down from the brain stem to the colon. Complete interruption of the vagus nerve causes a characteristic syndrome in which the soft palate droops on the side where damage occurred, and the gag reflex is also lost on that side. The voice is hoarse and nasal, and the vocal cord on the affected side is immobile. The result is difficulty swallowing ( dysphagia ) and speaking (dysphonia). The vagus nerve has several important branches, including the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

Latest Healthy Kids News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nSound counterintuitive? Well, researchers have long struggled with finding ways to coax families to move more, but the online game -- where the only prize was a lowly mug -- convinced spouses, parents and kids to log more steps in their daily walking routines. \nWhile all of the participants were white, and richer and healthier than most others their age in the United States, the study authors believe the approach holds plenty of potential. \nGames are \"a promising approach to improve daily health behaviors,\" said Dr. Mitesh Patel. He is an assistant professor of medicine and health care management at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \"But the design of the game is critical to its success.\" \nMore than half of adult Americans don't get enough exercise , according to Patel. There's evidence that connections with other people can help individuals exercise more, but \"most exercise programs focus on the individual and don't harness these interactions from social networks.\" \nMeanwhile, some game-style apps have tried to coax people to exercise, Patel said, but their design tends to assume \"that people behave rationally and make decisions in line with their longer-term goals. However, we know that most people don't behave this way.\" \nFor the new study, the researchers sent step-tracking technology, such as a Fitbit, to the participants. The investigators also provided an app to family members enlisted in the study. One person in each family group was randomly chosen to be tracked each day, and the group gained points if that person met goals for steps. \n\"Everyone got five lifelines to use on days they were sick or couldn't achieve their goals for other reasons. This provided a sense of forgiveness,\" Patel said. At the end of 12 weeks, groups would receive mugs if they met certain exercise goals. There were no other prizes. \nTwo hundred people from 94 family groups took part in the study. Overall, they were significantly different than the U.S. general population: 56 percent were female and their average age was 55. The group was active overall, exercising an average of about 7,500 steps a day before the study began; Patel said the average in the United States is closer to 5,000 steps. \nAlso, all participants were white, most had household incomes over $100,000, and all were part of the Framingham Heart Study, a long-term study of health in a Massachusetts town. Few smoked or had heart disease or diabetes . \nAbout half of the participants were assigned to play the game and get messages about their step goals, while the others only received the messages (the \"control\" group). \nDuring the first 12 weeks, those who played the game boosted their average daily step count by an adjusted 1,661 steps, compared to 636 in the control group. Most continued for another 12 weeks, and there was still a gap between the two groups in regard to how much they boosted their daily average step counts compared to baseline: 1,385 extra steps in the game group versus 798 in the control group. \nThe researchers didn't measure whether the health of those in the two groups improved. They also didn't analyze the cost of the program. \nMore research is under way and will be launched soon, Patel said. One goal is to better understand whether games could be used to help people lose weight and improve their health when they have conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes , Patel added. \nIn an accompanying commentary, researcher Dr. Ichiro Kawachi writes that \"much remains to be learned about 'gamification'\" -- a term that refers to the use of games to encourage actions like buying a product or exercising more. \nIn virtual reality (including games like Pokemon Go that combine real and imaginary images), \"the line between entertainment and public health is becoming progressively blurred,\" wrote Kawachi. He is chair of the department of social and behavioral sciences at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. \nAccording to Kawachi, there's an opportunity to use technology to make improving health an \"engaging, fulfilling and fun activity.\" \nThe study was published online Oct. 2 in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine .

Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nMONDAY, Oct. 2, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- As news pours in from Las Vegas on the record level of carnage inflicted by a shooter at yet another crowded public event, psychiatrists urge young people and their parents to not give way to fear. \nMedia reports say retiree Stephen Paddock, of Mesquite, Nev., killed at least 58 people and injured more than 500 at a crowded country music festival on the Las Vegas strip late Sunday. Police later found Paddock dead in his hotel room near the scene of the shooting. \nThe horrific killings come on the heels of other senseless tragedies perpetrated on young people who were simply enjoying a night out. Twenty-two attendees at an Ariana Grande concert were killed in Manchester, U.K., this past May, and 49 revelers were shot down in 2016 at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. \nIn the aftermath of these bloody and random attacks on young people at festive gatherings, the nerves of young would-be concertgoers or club attendees are bound to be frayed, psychiatrists say. \nCertainly, \"for those attending the concert in Las Vegas, their life will be marked as 'before' or 'after' the concert,\" said Dr. Victor Fornari. He directs child and adolescent psychiatry at Zucker Hillside Hospital, in Glen Oaks, N.Y. \n\"For those who were injured or lost a loved one, the impact of the event may be traumatic,\" Fornari said. \" Trauma coupled with loss may lead to a traumatic bereavement , often colored by so many complex emotions.\" \nAnd for those who witnessed the attack but survived, the psychological impact can be severe, he said. At these moments, the close support of family is key, as is the services of a trained trauma counselor, Fornari said. \nAnd what about the millions of young Americans who simply learned of the carnage via media? \nAccording to Fornari, people should remember that thousands of concerts and other group events occur nationwide every day, and the chances of encountering violence at any one event remain extremely slim. \n\"Parents need to recognize that attending a concert is generally a safe event,\" he said. \"The acts of violence we have seen are rare events, and should not interfere with young people from attending concerts.\" \nDr. Matthew Lorber, a psychiatrist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed. \n\"It is natural for parents to be fearful [after such events], but they have to be careful to not teach teens to be afraid of everything, but rather teach teens smart safety precautions,\" he said. \n\"You do not want your children to be afraid of going out to crowded events for the rest of their lives, and even worse have them avoiding doing it out of fear,\" Lorber said. \"The long-term effects of being exposed to these fear-invoking events can be traumatic, and it is important for parents to limit teens' exposures, and have an open dialogue answering all questions.\" \nAgreeing with Fornari, Lorber stressed that for the average young American, \"these events are very rare, and the chances of something happening at an event they are at are almost zero.\" \nAnd how should concerned parents address the fears of younger children? \nAccording to Lorber, \"It is inappropriate to talk about these things to children under 8, although at times they cannot be avoided because of peers talking about them. In that case, parents should address children's concerns, but reinforce that they are safe, their parents will protect them, and there are many more good people in the world who try and help others.\" Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Latest Mental Health News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nThe experimental test features a wireless sensor and smartphone app. It can detect amphetamines, or speed, in a drop of urine within seconds, its developers said. \nThe prototype device is small enough to be worn as a bracelet, is highly sensitive with a low risk for false-positive results, and costs about $50 to produce, according to their proof-of-concept design. \nThe report was published Sept. 28 in the journal Chem . \n\"Conventional drug detection generally use techniques that require long operation time, sophisticated experimental procedures, and expensive equipment with well-trained professional operators,\" said co-senior author Joon Hak Oh. \"Moreover, they are not usually portable.\" \nOh heads an organic electronics laboratory at Pohang University of Science and Technology. \n\"Our method is a new type of drug sensor that can solve all these problems at once,\" Oh said in a journal news release. \nOn-site amphetamine testing could potentially prevent additional crimes or accidents caused by drug abuse , said Ilha Hwang, a scientist from the same university who collaborated on the project. \n\"For example, breathalyzers are effective at catching drunk drivers on the spot, thereby preventing accidents,\" Hwang said. \"We hope that our sensor may have a similar effect with people who abuse amphetamines.\" \nBut before the device can be marketed, further testing in clinical settings is needed, the researchers said. \n-- Robert Preidt Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Latest Mental Health News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nHospital and emergency room treatment rates for prescription opioid overdoses (such as OxyContin ) decreased annually by about 5 percent between 2010 and 2014. This was about the same time tough new prescribing laws were drafted to combat the opioid epidemic, the study authors said. \nBut ER treatment rates for heroin overdose skyrocketed at the same time. Heroin overdose rates increased at an annual rate of more than 31 percent after 2008, said senior researcher Tina Hernandez-Boussard. She's an associate professor with the Stanford University School of Medicine. \nThese results provide \"the first piece of real evidence\" supporting what had been a strong suspicion that prescription painkiller addicts are turning to heroin because it's cheaper and easier to obtain, Hernandez-Boussard said. \nThe data also show that prescription opioids have greatly expanded the types of people now suffering from opioid addiction , Hernandez-Boussard said. \nBack in 1997, opioid addiction mostly affected young white males in the northeastern United States, she said. Now, all groups of Americans are facing the consequences of opioid use. \nMen and women are suffering opioid overdoses at about the same rate. There's an even distribution of overdose across all age groups. And the opioid crisis has spread throughout the United States, Hernandez-Boussard said. \nLindsey Vuolo is associate director of health law and policy at the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. She agreed that the hospital data mirrors what has been observed in previous studies on overdose deaths. \n\"It started with prescription opioids and then moved to heroin,\" Vuolo said. \nIf the trend continues, follow-up studies on hospital data will show a further shift from heroin to synthetic opioids like fentanyl, Vuolo added. \nFor the new study, Hernandez-Boussard and her colleagues reviewed federal data on hospital and emergency department admissions across the United States between 1997 and 2014. The investigators looked specifically at data on hospital admissions for opioid use and opioid-related overdose. \nThe findings reflect the curve of America's opioid crisis. \nPrescription opioid overdoses increased by 8 percent annually between 1997 and 2010 for hospitals. The increase was 5 percent annually between 2006 and 2010 specifically for emergency rooms. \nIn 2010, President Barack Obama ordered action on the prescription opioid epidemic. After that, overdose rates for these drugs declined by 5 percent annually for both hospitals and their emergency departments, the researchers found. \nTough laws and rules regulating prescription opioids made them less available. That may have caused untreated addicts to turn to heroin. And, that may have led to the annual 31 percent increase in heroin overdoses treated in the ER starting in 2008, the study authors suggested. \n\"There have been a lot of efforts and initiatives since 2010 focused on prescription opioids. It was nice to see that corresponding decrease in hospital and emergency department admissions,\" Hernandez-Boussard said. \n\"However, about the same time we saw a substantial increase in heroin-related admissions,\" she added. \nThe problem is that America's response to the opioid epidemic hasn't included adequate focus on treating addiction, Hernandez-Boussard explained. And Vuolo agreed. \n\"People who are already addicted to prescription opioids are not being connected to treatment, and therefore moving to other forms of opioids,\" Vuolo said. \n\"Although we may be restricting availability to prescription opioids, and those efforts may be working, we're still seeing people with addiction to other types of opioids,\" she said. \nAccording to Hernandez-Boussard, part of the problem is that there aren't enough resources to combat addiction. There aren't enough treatment centers and facilities to help people hooked on opioids. \nBut doctors who are treating patients for opioid abuse and overdose also are failing to connect these folks with treatment, Vuolo and Hernandez-Boussard said. \nVuolo pointed out that a recent study of the Pennsylvania Medicaid program found that only 33 percent of people treated for heroin overdose and 15 percent of people treated for prescription opioid overdose were connected with addiction treatment following their discharge from the hospital. \nHospital staff, health care professionals, and even police need to receive better training on how to steer opioid addicts into treatment, both experts said. \n\"Now we see these people are being discharged from the hospital alive following an overdose,\" Hernandez-Boussard said. \"We need to think about strategies regarding recovery programs and managing opioid dependence.\" \nThe new study was published in the October issue of the journal Health Affairs .

Doctor's response \nBacteria and viruses can cause middle ear infections . Bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas, and Moraxella account for about 85% of cases of acute otitis media . Viruses account for the remaining 15%. Affected infants under six weeks of age tend to have infections from a variety of different bacteria in the middle ear. What are the risk factors for ear infection? Bottlefeeding: The position of the breastfeeding child is better than that of the bottlefeeding position in terms of the function of the Eustachian tube that leads into the middle ear. If an infant needs to be bottlfed, it's better to hold the the baby rather than allowing them to lie down with the bottle. Ideally, they should not take the bottle to bed. (In addition to increasing the chance for acute infection, falling asleep with milk in the mouth enhances the risk of tooth decay .) Upper respiratory tract infection: Children often develop upper respiratory infections prior to developing this type of infection. Exposure to groups of children (as in child care centers) results in more frequent colds, and therefore more earaches. Exposure to air with irritants , such as tobacco smoke Birth defects: Children with cleft palate or Down syndrome are more prone to ear infections . Eustachian tube problems: Any problems with the Eustachian tubes (for example, blockage, malformation, inflammation) will   infection. If the individual has allergies he or she may have swelling and blockage of one or both Eustachian tubes. Immunosuppressed: Individuals with suppressed immunosuppression are at increased risk for ear infections . Ear infections later in childhood: Children who have episodes of acute infections before six months of age tend to have more later in childhood. \nRead our full medical article for more information on ear infection causes, symptoms, and treatments.

Cipro dosage For most infections the recommended oral dose for adults is 250-750 mg (immediate release tablets) every 12 hours or 500-1000 mg (extended release tablets) every 24 hours. The usual intravenous dose is 200-400 mg every 8-12 hours. Flagyl dosage Metronidazole may be taken orally with or without food. In the hospital, metronidazole can be administered intravenously to treat serious infections. The liver is primarily responsible for eliminating metronidazole from the body, and doses may need to be reduced in patients with liver disease and abnormal liver function . \nVarious metronidazole regimens are used. Some examples are listed below. Amebic dysentery: 750 mg orally 3 times daily for 5-10 days Amebic liver abscess: 500-750 mg orally three times daily for 5-10 days Anaerobic infections: 7.5 mg/kg orally or by injection every 6 hours for 7 to 10 days not to exceed 4 grams daily. Bacterial vaginosis: 750 mg (extended release tablets) once daily for 7 days or 500 mg twice daily for 7 days or 2 g single dose or one applicator-full of 0.75% vaginal gel, once or twice daily for 5 days. Clostridium difficile infection: 250-500 mg orally 4 times daily or 500-750 orally 3 times daily Giardia : 250 mg orally three times daily for 5 days Helicobacter pylori : 800-1500 mg orally daily for several days in combination with other drugs. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): 500 mg orally twice daily for 14 days in combination with other drugs. Trichomoniasis : 2 g single dose or 1 g twice Rosacea : apply topical gel 0.75-1% once daily What drug interactions occur with Cipro vs. Flagyl? Cipro drug interactions Ciprofloxacin administered together with theophylline ( Respbid , Slo-Bid , Theo-24 , Theolair ) can lead to elevated, toxic blood levels of theophylline. Theophylline is used to open airways in the treatment of asthma . Toxic levels of theophylline can lead to seizures, and disturbances in heart rhythm. If concurrent use of ciprofloxacin and theophylline cannot be avoided, frequent blood tests to monitor theophylline blood levels are recommended. Ciprofloxacin increases the effect of tizanidine (Zanaflex) that is used to treat muscle spasticity . Therefore, the two drugs should not be combined. Iron salts (for example, ferrous sulfate) may reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin because of formation of a ciprofloxacin-iron complex that is not absorbable. Antacids also may reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin. If patients are receiving iron salts or antacids and ciprofloxacin, the ciprofloxacin should be given two hours before or six hours after the iron salt or antacid. Ciprofloxacin may increase the blood thinning effect of warfarin ( Coumadin , Jantoven ). The reason for this is unknown. Anticoagulant activity should be monitored after starting or stopping ciprofloxacin. Sevelamer ( Renagel ) may reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin and possibly reduce the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin. Milk and orange juice also may reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin, as with iron and antacids, should be given two hours before or six hours after milk or orange juice. Administration of ciprofloxacin with diabetic medications (for example glyburide [Micronase, Diabeta, Glynase, Prestab]) may lead to severe low blood glucose . Ciprofloxacin may increase blood concentrations of sildenafil ( Viagra ) that is used for treating erectile dysfunction . This combination should be avoided if possible. Patients taking Cipro, Cipro XR can develop sensitivity of the skin to direct sunlight ( photosensitivity ) and should avoid exposure to sunlight or use sunblock. Fluoroquinolones worsen low blood glucose levels when combined with sulfonylureas, for example, glyburide (Micronase, Diabeta, Glynase, Prestab). Flagyl drug interactions Alcohol should be avoided because metronidazole and alcohol together can cause severe nausea, vomiting, cramps, flushing, and headache . Metronidazole can increase the blood thinning effects of warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) and   bleeding probably by reducing the breakdown of warfarin. Cimetidine ( Tagamet ) increases blood levels of metronidazole while cholestyramine ( Questran , Questran Light ) reduces blood levels of metronidazole by reducing its absorption. Metronidazole should not be combined with amprenavir ( Agenerase ) for treating human immunodeficiency disease (infection with HIV ) because amprenavir contains propylene glycol. Metronidazole blocks the breakdown of propylene glycol in the liver leading to accumulation of propylene glycol in blood. Accumulation of propylene glycol could cause seizures, increased heart rate, and lead to kidney failure. Metronidazole increases the blood levels of carbamazepine ( Tegretol , Tegretol XR, Equetro , Carbatrol ), lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid ) and cyclosporine though unknown mechanisms. Serious reactions may occur if these drugs are taken with metronidazole. Quick Guide Symptoms of Mono: Infectious Mononucleosis Treatment Are Cipro and Flagyl safe to take if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding? Doctors suggest that should not use Cipro if you are pregnant or breastfeeding because they do not know if it is safe.

Latest Sleep News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nJeffrey C. Hall, PhD, Michael Rosbash, PhD, and Michael W. Young, PhD, were able to \"peek inside our biological clock and elucidate its inner workings. Their discoveries explain how plants, animals and humans adapt their biological rhythm so that it is synchronized with the Earth's revolutions,\" according to a statement from the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden. \nWorking with fruit flies, the Nobel laureates isolated the period gene, which controls normal daily biological rhythm. They showed that this gene encodes a protein called PER, which accumulates in the cell during the night and degrades during the day. \"Thus, PER protein levels oscillate over a 24-hour cycle, in synchrony with the circadian rhythm,\" the organization explains. \nThe scientists then identified more workings of this machinery, exposing the self-sustaining clockwork inside the cell. \"We now recognize that biological clocks function by the same principles in cells of other multicellular organisms, including humans,\" the organization said. \n\"With exquisite precision, our inner clock adapts our physiology to the dramatically different phases of the day. The clock regulates critical functions such as behavior, hormone levels, sleep , body temperature and metabolism,\" they note. \nHall received his doctoral degree in 1971 at the University of Washington in Seattle and was a postdoctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena from 1971 to 1973. He joined the faculty at Brandeis University in Waltham, MA, in 1974. In 2002, he became associated with the University of Maine. \nRosbash received his doctoral degree in 1970 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. The next 3 years, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Since 1974, he has been on the faculty at Brandeis University. \nYoung received his doctoral degree at the University of Texas in Austin in 1975. Between 1975 and 1977, he was a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA. Since 1978, he has been part of the faculty at Rockefeller University in New York City. \nThe winners will share a prize of 9 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million). \u00a92017 WebMD, LLC.

Latest Prevention & Wellness News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nAn analysis of 2015 data from thousands of hospitals nationwide found that only 29.7 percent of them had at least some electronic access to, and integration of, patient health records from different health care providers, which is called \"interoperability.\" \nThat was only a slight increase from 24.5 percent in 2014, the researchers from University of California, San Francisco said. \n\"I would have thought we'd see more movement in these measures, because electronic health records have been widely adopted for several years,\" study senior author Julia Adler-Milstein said in a university news release. She is an associate professor in the university's department of medicine and the Institute for Health Policy Studies. \nThe researchers analyzed data from more than 2,600 hospitals that responded to the American Hospital Association's annual survey in 2014 and 2015. They also looked at a sample of more than 3,500 hospitals that responded to the 2015 supplement on information technology, which included new questions on the frequency of use of electronic patient data from outside sources. \nAdler-Milstein's team found that many hospitals have focused on transferring electronic health records from one institution to another, rather than integrating those records in ways that would enable doctors to quickly find information without having to read through a patient's entire record. \nThe researchers also found that 43 percent of the hospitals reported that outside patient information was available electronically when necessary, but more than one-third said they rarely or never used it. The most common barrier, the hospitals reported, was that doctors could not see the information in their own system's electronic health record. \n\"At the most fundamental level, interoperability and clinician use of outside records is about whether your doctor has access to the information she needs,\" Adler-Milstein said. \"So, when we know that less than half of hospitals can do that, it's terrifying.\" \nThe study was published Oct. 2 in the journal Health Affairs . \n-- Robert Preidt Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Latest Prevention & Wellness News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nThe report's release comes one day after a lone gunman unleashed automatic rifle fire upon a crowd of country music concertgoers in Las Vegas, killing at least 58 people and injuring 500 more, making it one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history. \nGun-related deaths are the third leading cause of injury-related deaths in the United States, but detailed data on this major health issue are lacking, according to study author Dr. Faiz Gani, a research fellow at the Johns Hopkins Surgery Center for Outcomes Research in Baltimore. \n\"Until people are aware of the problem's full extent, we can't have the best informed discussions to guide policy,\" he said in a Hopkins news release. \nThe researchers reviewed U.S. gun-related injuries that ended up in ER visits and hospitalizations. About 89 percent of patients were men. Almost half were between the ages 18 and 29. \nThe average annual per-patient ER cost was slightly more than $5,000. Average in-patient hospital charge for gunshot victims was nearly $96,000, the study showed. \nHowever, overall ER admissions for gunshot wounds fell by 23 percent from 2006 to 2013. But there was a spike in gunshot-related ER and hospital admissions in 2014. \nThe proportion of gunshot- wound patients with a previously diagnosed mental health disorder rose from 5 percent to 7.5 percent during the study period, and the proportion of patients injured in accidental shootings increased from 34 percent to 37 percent. \nMost of the patients were injured in intentional (nearly 50 percent) or accidental shootings (35 percent), while attempted suicide accounted for 5 percent. \nThe incidence of mental health disorders was highest (40 percent) among patients injured by attempted suicide . Mental health disorders were also higher among patients injured while hunting (12.6 percent) or military-grade rifles (12.5 percent). \nOf the patients in the study, more than 8 percent died in the ER or after admission to the hospital. Death rates were highest among patients age 60 and older (23 percent), those with the most severe injuries (33 percent), and those who attempted suicide (38.5 percent). \nThe study appears in the October issue of the journal Health Affairs . \nGani noted the study didn't include people who died from gunshot wounds before reaching the hospital or those who didn't go to a hospital, so it likely underestimates the overall burden of gunshot injuries and deaths. \nThe Las Vegas gunman, identified as Stephen Craig Paddock, 64, of Mesquite, Nev., fired into the crowd from his perch on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, across the street from the concert site, media reports said. \nSWAT teams stormed Paddock's hotel room and found he had killed himself, authorities said. He had as many as 10 guns with him, including rifles, according to published reports. \nBesides the dead, more than 400 other victims were taken to the hospital for injuries, authorities said. \n-- Robert Preidt Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Getting fit doesn't have to be expensive or complicated. In fact, it can be as simple as putting one foot in front of the other. Latest Exercise & Fitness News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nStarting a walking program can get you on the path to better health. All you need to get going are supportive athletic shoes, comfortable clothes, a safe place to walk, and the OK from your doctor if you're out of shape or have any chronic conditions. \nWhen you're new to exercise , it's important to start slowly. Try walking for 5 to 10 minutes a day for the first few weeks. Gradually add more time and distance. Eventually, pick up the pace -- your goal is to walk briskly for at least 30 minutes on most days. \nOne way to help you stay motivated to reach your fitness goals is to keep track of how many steps you take each day. You can do this with an inexpensive pedometer or a fitness program on your smartphone or smartwatch. Aim to reach 10,000 steps. \nThat might sound like a lot, but you can add to your daily total in many small ways. Besides your daily walk, work in extra steps by moving whenever you can. Walk to your co-worker's desk to talk about that big project instead of sending an email. Take the stairs instead of the elevator whenever possible. \nWarm-ups and cool-downs are important parts of every fitness plan, even walking. Before and after your workout, walk slowly for 5 minutes. At the end of every walk, gently stretch your muscles. Don't skip these steps -- they can help prevent injury. \nFor fun and fitness, round up your office staff or some neighbors for a walking club. Walking in a group will also keep you motivated to continue. Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay. All rights reserved.

Latest Prevention & Wellness News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nDispersants are chemicals used to break up oil slicks into smaller patches that can be degraded naturally or diluted by large volumes of water. \nU.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences researchers are conducting a long-term follow-up study of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. \nThey found that cleanup workers exposed to dispersants were more likely to experience symptoms such as cough , wheeze, tightness in the chest, and burning in the eyes, nose, throat or lungs than those who weren't exposed to dispersants. \nLead author Dale Sandler said the scientists were able to distinguish between health effects related to dispersants and those related to petroleum products in the spill. \nThe findings are limited to workers involved in the cleanup and do not apply to the general public, she said. \n\"The health effects that we see in the workers don't necessarily apply to the community at large, although many of the workers live in affected areas,\" Sandler said in an institute news release. \nMany of the workers who reported symptoms while working on the oil spill cleanup no longer had them one to three years later, but some still have them, Sandler said. \nInstitute Director Linda Birnbaum said additional research might help explain their symptoms. \n\"Some of them are continuing to not feel well, and we don't know what factors are contributing to it. The ongoing [Gulf study] is important for shedding light on the potential health impacts associated with an oil spill,\" she said. \nThe study was published online Sept. 15 in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives . \n-- Robert Preidt Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Latest Prevention & Wellness News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nThe nationwide poll included more than 2,500 adults. The survey also found that one in three people said another person whose care they were closely involved with had experienced a medical error. \nMost medical errors were associated with diagnosis and patient-provider communications. Outpatient settings were a common site of medical errors. \nOn average, respondents who experienced a medical error identified at least seven different factors that caused the error. Nearly half of those who noted an error told medical staff or other workers at the health care facility about it. \nMost people feel that health care providers have the prime responsibility for patient safety. But survey participants also said that patients and their families have a role, too. \nStill, most people said they didn't worry personally about patient safety, the survey found. \nWhen medical errors occur, they often have lasting impact on the patient's physical and emotional health, finances, or family relationships. \nThe survey was done by the IHI/NPSF Lucian Leape Institute and NORC at the University of Chicago. \n\"The survey results show that Americans recognize that patient safety is a critically important, but complex, issue,\" Dr. Tejal Gandhi, chief clinical and safety officer, IHI, and president of the IHI/NPSF Lucian Leape Institute, said in an organization news release. \n-- Robert Preidt Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Latest Prevention & Wellness News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nTo come to that conclusion, researchers reviewed 989 medical mistakes that occurred at six hospitals in Massachusetts between 2013 and 2015. The hospitals were part of a program that informs patients about medical errors, apologizes for them, pledges to investigate and correct the problem, and offers compensation. \nOnly 5 percent of the medical errors led to malpractice claims or lawsuits, according to the report. When the program led to compensation, the median payment was $75,000. In 2015, the median payment nationwide when plaintiffs won malpractice lawsuits was about $225,000. \nThe study was published Oct. 2 in the journal Health Affairs . \n\"Our findings suggest that communication-and-resolution programs will not lead to higher liability costs when hospitals adhere to their commitment to offer compensation proactively,\" lead author Michelle Mello, a professor of health research and policy, and of law at Stanford University in California, and colleagues wrote. \nMedical errors are a leading cause of death in the United States, and the lawsuits they can trigger are a major concern for hospitals and doctors, the study authors noted. \nNot only did the responsibility program examined in the study reduce liability costs, it also led to major improvements in patient safety, the researchers said. \n\"In these programs, hospitals scrutinize every serious harm event to answer the question, 'What can we learn?' \" Mello said in a university news release. \"Traditionally, a risk manager's focus has been on the patients who complain about the care or threaten to sue. But every patient deserves to know that what happened to them is being taken seriously.\" \n-- Robert Preidt Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay. All rights reserved.

The vagus nerve also brings sensory information back to the brain from the ear, tongue, pharynx, and larynx. The vagus nerve is the tenth cranial nerve. It originates in the medulla oblongata, a part of the brain stem, and extends all the way down from the brain stem to the colon. Complete interruption of the vagus nerve causes a characteristic syndrome in which the soft palate droops on the side where damage occurred, and the gag reflex is also lost on that side. The voice is hoarse and nasal, and the vocal cord on the affected side is immobile. The result is difficulty swallowing ( dysphagia ) and speaking (dysphonia). The vagus nerve has several important branches, including the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

Latest Heart News   \nHeart failure means that the heart isn't pumping as effectively as it should. Acute episodes of heart failure account for more than 1 million hospitalizations each in the United States and Europe a year. \nSpanish Ministry of Health researchers led by Oscar Miro of Hospital Clinic of Barcelona used 13 factors to assess death risk in these patients. These factors included age, systolic (top number) blood pressure reading, respiratory rate, potassium level, and Barthel index score at admission, which is a scale used to assess mobility and independent daily living. \nThe researchers tested their model in more than 4,700 patients in Spain from 2009 to 2011 and validated them in another group of patients three years later. \nThe assessment was highly accurate in predicting 30-day death risk, the researchers said. This was especially true among the 10 percent of patients at very high risk (about 45 percent) and the 40 percent of patients at low risk (less than 2 percent). \nAbout 9 out of 10 acute heart failure patients visit the ER for their symptoms, but emergency physicians currently don't classify these patients based on death risk, the study team noted. \nThere are several risk scores available, but a more reliable tool is needed, the researchers said. \nThe study results were published Oct. 2 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine . \n-- Robert Preidt Copyright   SOURCE: Annals of Internal Medicine , news release, Oct. 10, 2017 Next Article: Could Skipping Breakfast Feed Heart Disease?

In other cases, the NOACs' effectiveness is reduced, robbing patients of some protection against stroke and heart attack. \n\"NOACs alone do not pose a significant risk of bleeding, but the concurrent use of NOACs with certain drugs that share the same metabolic pathways may cause increased risk of major bleeding,\" said study lead researcher Dr. Shang-Hung Chang, an associate professor of cardiology with Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taoyuan, Taiwan. \nMeanwhile, a second study found that blood thinners can greatly increase a person's risk of finding blood in their urine. \nAs a result, patients might unnecessarily wind up in the hospital or emergency room, or undergo an unneeded invasive procedure, said senior researcher Dr. Robert Nam. He is a professor of surgery and head of genitourinary oncology with Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center in Toronto. \n\"Patients and physicians need to discuss this, to try and prevent patients having to be hospitalized or come to the emergency room in the middle of the night,\" Nam said. \nThe first study looked at the bleeding risk associated with NOAC drugs dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban ( Xarelto ) and apixaban ( Eliquis ). \nThese drugs are primarily used to prevent risk of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation , an abnormal heart rhythm that can cause blood to pool and clot inside the heart, said Dr. Deepak Bhatt. A spokesman for the American Heart Association, he is also executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women's Hospital's Heart & Vascular Center in Boston. \nNOACs are being used more frequently because they're easier to use and produce fewer side effects than warfarin , an older anticoagulant that has many food and drug interactions, said Bhatt. \nChang and his colleagues also decided to investigate whether NOACs might have previously unknown interactions with other commonly used medications. The team analyzed health data on 91,330 Taiwanese patients with atrial fibrillation who were prescribed an NOAC. \nThe investigators found that bleeding risk increased significantly when NOACs were used in combination with amiodarone , fluconazole , rifampin and phenytoin -- four drugs that treat widely different conditions. \nThe researchers also found that other drugs dampened the effectiveness of NOACs, including atorvastatin , digoxin , and erythromycin or clarithromycin . \nBhatt said he's particularly concerned about the effect of atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) on NOACs' effectiveness. \n\"That's a very commonly prescribed cholesterol -lowering drug, especially now that it's generic,\" Bhatt said. In fact, the researchers found that atorvastatin was the drug most commonly prescribed alongside an NOAC. \n\"That's a big deal because that means all those patients on both drugs have a lower risk of bleeding, but on the flip side then would have a higher risk of stroke ,\" Bhatt said. \nThe second study found that people are much more likely to go to the hospital for blood in their urine if they're taking blood thinners. \nNam and his colleagues examined medical data on 2.5 million Ontario residents, including nearly 809,000 who had been prescribed a blood thinner. \nDuring an average follow-up period of 7 years, people on blood thinners were six to 10 times more likely to wind up hospitalized or in the ER complaining of blood in their urine compared with others not taking the drugs, Nam said. \nAlthough blood in urine is alarming and requires investigation, Nam said the side effect is not immediately dangerous. Patients should be informed of the potential for blood in the urine , and counseled what to do if it occurs. \n\"The result of these findings should not affect the decision to treat with these drugs,\" Nam said. \"The benefits outweigh the risks. These are not life-threatening complications. Patients should not stop taking these drugs because of the potential side effect.\" \nIn at least one way, this side effect can be welcome, said Dr. Vincent Bufalino, an AHA spokesman and cardiologist in Naperville, Ill. \n\"Blood thinners can be an advantage because when they cause bleeding in someone on a normal dose, usually there's a medical issue,\" Bufalino said. \"It actually helps you uncover a problem.\" \nThe researchers found that rates of bladder cancer detection were twice as high in people taking blood thinners compared to the general population. The drugs made the tumor produce more blood, Nam said. \n\"Because it bled, they went in, looked, and found the bladder cancer and were able to get it earlier than would have happened waiting for a patient to develop symptoms on their own,\" Bufalino said. \"In many of these circumstances, the cancers would have been missed until they were more advanced because the patient wouldn't have known there was a problem.\" \nThe two studies were published in the Oct. 3 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association .

According to CBS News , Petty was found unconscious and not breathing and died later at the hospital. Latest Heart News   \nHis death was confirmed in a statement released Monday night by his longtime manager, who said Petty died \"surrounded by family, his bandmates and friends.\" \nPetty and his band broke into fame in the 1970s and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. They garnered legions of fans and continued to tour over the past four decades. \nPetty's last show was at the Hollywood Bowl last Monday, where he and the Heartbreakers played three sold-out performances to end their 40th anniversary tour. \nSpeaking in December to Rolling Stone , Petty seemed unsure of how long the band's hectic touring pace could last. \n\"It's very likely we'll keep playing, but will we take on 50 shows in one tour? I don't think so,\" he said. \"I'd be lying if I didn't say I was thinking this might be the last big one. We're all on the backside of our sixties.

By Amy Norton HealthDay Reporter \nMONDAY, Oct. 2,   Middle-aged adults who routinely skip breakfast are more likely to have clogged heart arteries than those who enjoy a big morning meal, a new study finds. Latest Heart   \nThe findings are the latest to link breakfast to better heart health. \nThey suggest that people who eat breakfast -- especially a hearty one -- are less likely to harbor plaques in their arteries. \nPlaques are deposits of fat, calcium and other substances that can build up in arteries, causing them to harden and narrow -- a condition called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis can lead to heart attacks , strokes and other complications. \nThe new study does not prove that skipping breakfast directly harms people's arteries. \n\"It's not that you skip breakfast, you get plaques,\" said senior researcher Jose Penalvo, of Tufts University's Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy in Boston. \nBut, he said, there are several reasons that forgoing the morning meal could contribute to the risk of atherosclerosis. \nFor many people, skipping breakfast is part of a \"cluster\" of bad habits, said Penalvo. These people tend to eat out a lot, and opt for nutritionally dubious convenience foods, for instance. \nOn top of that, Penalvo said, skipping breakfast may have negative effects on appetite-regulating hormones, blood sugar and insulin (a hormone that regulates blood sugar ). \nPrior studies have shown that breakfast fans are less likely to be obese or have diabetes or heart disease . \nBut the current study actually used objective tests, Penalvo said. The researchers used ultrasound to screen middle-aged adults for \"subclinical\" atherosclerosis -- early plaque buildup that is not causing any symptoms. \nThe study included more than 4,000 adults ages 40 to 54 from Spain. Three percent were chronic breakfast-skippers, while 27 percent regularly had a big breakfast. That meant they ate more than 20 percent of their daily calories at their morning meal. \nMost people -- 70 percent -- ate a relatively low-calorie breakfast. \nIt turned out that those three groups also differed in their odds of subclinical atherosclerosis. \nNearly 75 percent of breakfast-skippers showed such plaque buildup. That compared with 57 percent of people who ate a big breakfast, and 64 percent of those who favored a light one. \nBreakfast fans were healthier in many ways, the study found. They generally ate more fruits and vegetables, seafood and lean meat, for instance. They were also less likely to be obese or have high blood pressure , diabetes or unhealthy cholesterol levels . \nBut even with all those factors weighed, breakfast-skipping, itself, was still tied to a higher risk of atherosclerosis. \nKim Larson is a registered dietitian and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \nShe said the findings are important, in part, because many adults -- around 30 percent -- routinely skip breakfast. \nAnd some people, she noted, purposely cut out breakfast when they're trying to lose weight . \nThat's a bad idea, Larson explained, because of the effects on appetite and eating habits the rest of the day. \n\"People who skip breakfast generally make up for it later in the day,\" said Larson, who wasn't involved in the study. In the end, she said, they typically down more calories over the course of the day, versus people who eat breakfast. \nThe current study did not dig into the nutritional quality of people's breakfast choices. But when it comes to preventing disease, Larson said, \"quality matters.\" \nA bagel and coffee is \"better than nothing,\" she noted. However, Larson recommended that breakfast include a healthy mix of protein, carbohydrates and fat. \nShe acknowledged that time is an obstacle. Many people are rushed in the morning and end up eating a muffin in the car. \nBut breakfast does not need to be extravagant to be healthy, Larson said. Some of her suggestions: oatmeal with nuts and fruit; whole-grain toast with nut butter; granola mixed with yogurt and fruit; and apple slices with peanut butter. \nPenalvo encouraged people to look at it this way: Eating a healthy breakfast is actually an enjoyable way to potentially curb your heart disease risk. \n\"This is a really positive message,\" he said. \nOf course, breakfast is not a stand-alone solution. Penalvo said it should be part of a generally healthy diet and other good habits such as regular exercise . \nThe   the Journal of the American College of Cardiology .

Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Americans may be more willing to talk about mental health issues these days, but misperceptions and stigmas persist, a new survey finds. \nThe survey, of more than 3,000 U.S. adults, found that 70 percent said they feel people are more open to discussing mental health compared with a decade ago. \nMost respondents also said they'd want to help a family member or friend struggling with depression or other mental health conditions. \nOn the other hand, age-old misperceptions were still common. Many people, for example, thought that mental health disorders were at least partially driven by \"personal failings.\" \n\"That's certainly disappointing,\" said Dr. Don Mordecai, director of mental health and addiction medicine services at Kaiser Permanente, in Oakland, Calif., which commissioned the poll. \n\"These are true brain conditions,\" Mordecai said, \"and we have to get away from the blaming.\" \nIn reality, he explained, mental health disorders are rooted in factors like genetics, traumatic experiences and imbalances in brain chemicals. \nDr. Jeffrey Borenstein, a psychiatrist who was not involved in the survey, agreed. \n\"Psychiatric conditions are not moral weaknesses or character flaws,\" said Borenstein, president of the New York City-based Brain & Behavior Research Foundation. \nBorenstein said he was surprised by how many survey respondents mistakenly believed that character was involved. Over 60 percent thought that personal weaknesses were at least partly responsible for depression , for example. \n\"We clearly have a long way to go in educating the public,\" Borenstein said. \"These conditions are equal to any other medical condition. In this case, the organ affected is the brain.\" \nThe poll, conducted online in August, included a nationally representative sample of just over 3,000 U.S. adults. \nWhen asked about the national climate around mental health, 70 percent said they thought Americans were now more open to discussing it. \nPeople also appeared willing to talk about their own struggles. Nearly 40 percent said they'd faced a mental health \"issue\" at some point, and nearly all of those people -- 92 percent -- had sought some kind of help. \nIn another positive finding, 70 percent of respondents said they would be comfortable offering support if someone they knew had a mental health condition. \nBut the poll also uncovered inconsistencies. \nThree-quarters of respondents felt at least somewhat informed about mental health conditions, while a similar percentage said the disorders should be treated no differently from physical health problems. \nYet they also thought personal character was a factor in many mental health conditions. Fully 80 percent thought that was true of people with alcohol or drug addiction . \nAnd a significant number thought \"most people\" with mental health disorders can get better on their own. That included one-quarter of millennials, Mordecai pointed out -- which is concerning. \n\"You wouldn't walk around with a broken leg , thinking, 'I'll just heal this myself,'\" he said. \nIn another concerning finding, more than half of respondents said they thought a family member or friend was silently struggling with a mental health condition -- out of \"fear of stigma\" or shame. \nIn those cases, Borenstein said, people can try to be proactive -- telling their friend that they are concerned and ready to offer help if it's wanted, for example. \nMordecai pointed to one of the bright spots in the survey: \"If you're dealing with a mental health issue, these results show that there are people around you who stand willing to help,\" he said. \nRecognizing when you have symptoms, and speaking up about it, are the first steps toward treatment and recovery, Mordecai said. \n\"We have effective treatments,\" he stressed -- from \"talk therapy\" to medications. \nBorenstein agreed. \"These are conditions that no one should be ashamed of,\" he said. \"It's very important that people seek help, or encourage others to seek help when they need it.\" Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

What are anti-anxiety (anxiolytic) drugs? \nAnxiolytics (also termed anti- anxiety or anti-panic drugs ) are medications that are used to treat a health condition called anxiety . The type of anxiety that requires treatment is called generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ). This disorder causes excessive worry and anxiety, significant distress, and affects the ability for a person to function. Moreover, the symptoms of anxiety occur on most days for at least six months. Generalized anxiety disorder is treated with psychotherapy and medications. How do anti-anxiety drugs and benzodiazepines work (mechanism of action)? \nAntidepressants reduce anxiety by increasing the concentration of chemicals (neurotransmitters) that the brain uses to communicate. These neurotransmitters include serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine . \nBuspirone may reduce anxiety by stimulating serotonin and dopamine receptors on nerves, thereby altering the chemical messages that nerves receive. \nBenzodiazepines reduce symptoms of anxiety by increasing the action of a brain chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA is a chemical that nerve cells use to communicate with each other and it reduces brain activity. It is believed that excessive activity in the brain may lead to anxiety or other psychiatric disorders. \nPregabalin is an anticonvulsant. Like benzodiazepines, Pregabalin also increases the action of GABA, and this may be its main mechanism for reducing anxiety. \nHydroxyzine is an antihistamine that causes sedation. It helps treat insomnia caused by anxiety, and other medical conditions. What are the medical uses for anti-anxiety drugs? \nAnxiolytics are used to treat anxiety or symptoms caused by anxiety.

Police later found Paddock dead in his hotel room near the scene of the shooting. \nThe horrific killings come on the heels of other senseless tragedies perpetrated on young people who were simply enjoying a night out. Twenty-two attendees at an Ariana Grande concert were killed in Manchester, U.K., this past May, and 49 revelers were shot down in 2016 at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. \nIn the aftermath of these bloody and random attacks on young people at festive gatherings, the nerves of young would-be concertgoers or club attendees are bound to be frayed, psychiatrists say. \nCertainly, \"for those attending the concert in Las Vegas, their life will be marked as 'before' or 'after' the concert,\" said Dr. Victor Fornari. He directs child and adolescent psychiatry at Zucker Hillside Hospital, in Glen Oaks, N.Y. \n\"For those who were injured or lost a loved one, the impact of the event may be traumatic,\" Fornari said. \" Trauma coupled with loss may lead to a traumatic bereavement , often colored by so many complex emotions.\" \nAnd for those who witnessed the attack but survived, the psychological impact can be severe, he said. At these moments, the close support of family is key, as is the services of a trained trauma counselor, Fornari said. \nAnd what about the millions of young Americans who simply learned of the carnage via media? \nAccording to Fornari, people should remember that thousands of concerts and other group events occur nationwide every day, and the chances of encountering violence at any one event remain extremely slim. \n\"Parents need to recognize that attending a concert is generally a safe event,\" he said. \"The acts of violence we have seen are rare events, and should not interfere with young people from attending concerts.\" \nDr. Matthew Lorber, a psychiatrist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed. \n\"It is natural for parents to be fearful [after such events], but they have to be careful to not teach teens to be afraid of everything, but rather teach teens smart safety precautions,\" he said. \n\"You do not want your children to be afraid of going out to crowded events for the rest of their lives, and even worse have them avoiding doing it out of fear,\" Lorber said. \"The long-term effects of being exposed to these fear-invoking events can be traumatic, and it is important for parents to limit teens' exposures, and have an open dialogue answering all questions.\" \nAgreeing with Fornari, Lorber stressed that for the average young American, \"these events are very rare, and the chances of something happening at an event they are at are almost zero.\" \nAnd how should concerned parents address the fears of younger children? \nAccording to Lorber, \"It is inappropriate to talk about these things to children under 8, although at times they cannot be avoided because of peers talking about them. In that case, parents should address children's concerns, but reinforce that they are safe, their parents will protect them, and there are many more good people in the world who try and help others.\" Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Latest Mental Health News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nThe experimental test features a wireless sensor and smartphone app. It can detect amphetamines, or speed, in a drop of urine within seconds, its developers said. \nThe prototype device is small enough to be worn as a bracelet, is highly sensitive with a low risk for false-positive results, and costs about $50 to produce, according to their proof-of-concept design. \nThe report was published Sept. 28 in the journal Chem . \n\"Conventional drug detection generally use techniques that require long operation time, sophisticated experimental procedures, and expensive equipment with well-trained professional operators,\" said co-senior author Joon Hak Oh. \"Moreover, they are not usually portable.\" \nOh heads an organic electronics laboratory at Pohang University of Science and Technology. \n\"Our method is a new type of drug sensor that can solve all these problems at once,\" Oh said in a journal news release. \nOn-site amphetamine testing could potentially prevent additional crimes or accidents caused by drug abuse , said Ilha Hwang, a scientist from the same university who collaborated on the project. \n\"For example, breathalyzers are effective at catching drunk drivers on the spot, thereby preventing accidents,\" Hwang said. \"We hope that our sensor may have a similar effect with people who abuse amphetamines.\" \nBut before the device can be marketed, further testing in clinical settings is needed, the researchers said. \n-- Robert Preidt Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Latest Mental Health News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nHospital and emergency room treatment rates for prescription opioid overdoses (such as OxyContin ) decreased annually by about 5 percent between 2010 and 2014. This was about the same time tough new prescribing laws were drafted to combat the opioid epidemic, the study authors said. \nBut ER treatment rates for heroin overdose skyrocketed at the same time. Heroin overdose rates increased at an annual rate of more than 31 percent after 2008, said senior researcher Tina Hernandez-Boussard. She's an associate professor with the Stanford University School of Medicine. \nThese results provide \"the first piece of real evidence\" supporting what had been a strong suspicion that prescription painkiller addicts are turning to heroin because it's cheaper and easier to obtain, Hernandez-Boussard said. \nThe data also show that prescription opioids have greatly expanded the types of people now suffering from opioid addiction , Hernandez-Boussard said. \nBack in 1997, opioid addiction mostly affected young white males in the northeastern United States, she said. Now, all groups of Americans are facing the consequences of opioid use. \nMen and women are suffering opioid overdoses at about the same rate. There's an even distribution of overdose across all age groups. And the opioid crisis has spread throughout the United States, Hernandez-Boussard said. \nLindsey Vuolo is associate director of health law and policy at the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. She agreed that the hospital data mirrors what has been observed in previous studies on overdose deaths. \n\"It started with prescription opioids and then moved to heroin,\" Vuolo said. \nIf the trend continues, follow-up studies on hospital data will show a further shift from heroin to synthetic opioids like fentanyl, Vuolo added. \nFor the new study, Hernandez-Boussard and her colleagues reviewed federal data on hospital and emergency department admissions across the United States between 1997 and 2014. The investigators looked specifically at data on hospital admissions for opioid use and opioid-related overdose. \nThe findings reflect the curve of America's opioid crisis. \nPrescription opioid overdoses increased by 8 percent annually between 1997 and 2010 for hospitals. The increase was 5 percent annually between 2006 and 2010 specifically for emergency rooms. \nIn 2010, President Barack Obama ordered action on the prescription opioid epidemic. After that, overdose rates for these drugs declined by 5 percent annually for both hospitals and their emergency departments, the researchers found. \nTough laws and rules regulating prescription opioids made them less available. That may have caused untreated addicts to turn to heroin. And, that may have led to the annual 31 percent increase in heroin overdoses treated in the ER starting in 2008, the study authors suggested. \n\"There have been a lot of efforts and initiatives since 2010 focused on prescription opioids. It was nice to see that corresponding decrease in hospital and emergency department admissions,\" Hernandez-Boussard said. \n\"However, about the same time we saw a substantial increase in heroin-related admissions,\" she added. \nThe problem is that America's response to the opioid epidemic hasn't included adequate focus on treating addiction, Hernandez-Boussard explained. And Vuolo agreed. \n\"People who are already addicted to prescription opioids are not being connected to treatment, and therefore moving to other forms of opioids,\" Vuolo said. \n\"Although we may be restricting availability to prescription opioids, and those efforts may be working, we're still seeing people with addiction to other types of opioids,\" she said. \nAccording to Hernandez-Boussard, part of the problem is that there aren't enough resources to combat addiction. There aren't enough treatment centers and facilities to help people hooked on opioids. \nBut doctors who are treating patients for opioid abuse and overdose also are failing to connect these folks with treatment, Vuolo and Hernandez-Boussard said. \nVuolo pointed out that a recent study of the Pennsylvania Medicaid program found that only 33 percent of people treated for heroin overdose and 15 percent of people treated for prescription opioid overdose were connected with addiction treatment following their discharge from the hospital. \nHospital staff, health care professionals, and even police need to receive better training on how to steer opioid addicts into treatment, both experts said. \n\"Now we see these people are being discharged from the hospital alive following an overdose,\" Hernandez-Boussard said. \"We need to think about strategies regarding recovery programs and managing opioid dependence.\" \nThe new study was published in the October issue of the journal Health Affairs .

Latest Senior Health News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nResearchers reviewed 10 years of national data and found that 23 percent of people aged 50 and older who killed themselves had disclosed their suicide intent. The older they were, the more likely they were to disclose, the investigators found. \nAny indication of suicidal thoughts is an opportunity for prevention, said study lead investigator Namkee Choi. She is chair in gerontology at the University of Texas at Austin. \nDoctors and others \"need better preparation to screen and aid those in need to prevent suicide ,\" Choi said. \nPeople with depression and health problems, and those who had recently received mental health care or treatment for drug or alcohol abuse , were also likely to say something before trying to kill themselves, the study found. \nDisclosure was most often to an intimate partner or other family member, the findings showed. Few older adults who died by suicide had talked about it with a health care professional. \nPeople who killed themselves with guns or through hanging/suffocation were less likely to disclose their intentions ahead of time. Among those who used guns, disclosure was more common among men than women, according to the report. \nThe findings were published Oct. 4 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine . \n\" Depressed mood, health problems and other stressors were associated with increased odds of disclosure,\" Choi said in a journal news release. So a \"suicide may have been prevented by providing the services needed to alleviate these problems,\" she suggested. \n-- Robert Preidt Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay. All rights reserved.

Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Less than 20 years ago, health experts thought it was only a matter of time before measles was completely eradicated in the United States. But over the past 15 years, the disease has gained a new foothold in the United States, likely due to parents choosing not to vaccinate their children, a new study suggests. \nFrom 2001 to 2015 measles cases in the United States remained very low (less than 1 case per million people), but there's still been a signficant rise, the study found. \nOverall, measles incidence doubled -- from 0.28 per million in 2001 to 0.56 per million in 2015. Infants and young children were hit hardest, and most cases were among the unvaccinated, the research showed. \nThe findings suggest that, \"being unvaccinated rather than failure of vaccine is the main driver of measles spread,\" said lead researcher Nakia Clemmons, an epidemiologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThe good news is that most parents are still protecting their children from measles by getting them the measles- mumps - rubella (MMR) vaccine, she said. \n\"Thanks to high vaccination rates, measles cases among Americans has remained rare since the disease was eliminated,\" Clemmons said. \nMeasles outbreaks, however, can and do still occur in the United States, she said. \n\"Measles is still commonly transmitted in many parts of the world. Unvaccinated U.S. residents returning from overseas travel and foreign visitors to the U.S. may develop measles and expose people in United States. When measles gets into communities of unvaccinated people, outbreaks are more likely to occur,\" Clemmons said. \nThe best way to protect children against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases is to ensure they are up to date on vaccines , she said. \n\"Getting vaccines at the recommended ages protects children at the earliest age possible from serious vaccine-preventable diseases,\" Clemmons said. \nDr. Paul Offit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \n\"The reason measles has come back is not because the virus has mutated. It's not because the vaccine isn't effective. It's because a critical number of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children,\" said Offit, who wasn't involved with the study. \nMeasles is now endemic in the United States at a very low level, he said. \"It's now spreading from one American to another.\" \nOffit, however, doesn't expect that measles will reach the epidemic proportions it once had. \"We used to have 3 to 4 million cases a year, 48,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths a year, he said. \"Measles was a scourge in this country.\" \nSince measles is the most contagious of all the vaccine-preventable diseases, it makes sense it's the disease to come back first. It could be the harbinger of the return of other diseases, Offit said. \"It's the canary in the coal mine,\" he said. \nUsing data from the CDC, the researchers looked at the number of measles cases in the United States that occurred after the disease was nearly eradicated. \nBetween 2001 and 2015, nearly 1,800 cases of measles were reported. People who suffered from the disease were an average of 15 years old and nearly half were girls, the researchers found. \nNearly 70 percent of those who came down with measles were not vaccinated. It was unknown if another 18 percent who contracted measles had been vaccinated or not, Clemmons said. \nAbout 27 percent of measles cases were imported from other countries; the rest were acquired in the United States. \nMeasles was most likely to affect infants ages 6 to 11 months and toddlers 12 to 15 months. The rate of measles started to drop beginning at 16 months, the researchers said. \nThe number of measles cases each year varied between 24 and 658, the study showed. \nOffit said it's not unusual for parents to be wary of vaccines . \nKids are subjected to 26 different vaccinations and as many as five shots at one time to prevent diseases most people don't see and using biological fluids most people don't understand, he said. \n\"It's not surprising there's been pushback. Vaccines are a victim of their own success,\" Offit said. \nThe report was published as a letter in the Oct. 3 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association .

Latest Arthritis News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nSpending on the drug, an anti-inflammatory, has tripled from $4.5 billion in 2012. It is the fifth straight year Humira topped the list of all drug sales. \nLevothyroxine, for thyroid conditions, was the most commonly prescribed drug, as it has been for each of the 5 years, with 123 million prescriptions in 2016. \nThe total number of all prescriptions dispensed in 2016 hit 4.4 billion, up 1.9% from 2015, on par with increases seen in earlier years. \n\"Notably,\" the authors of the report say, \"chronic prescriptions with 3-month duration have increased dramatically in the last 2 years, and prescriptions grew by 3.3% when adjusting for prescription size.\" \nUse of pain medications, both narcotic and nonnarcotic, was down 1% as restrictions on prescribing and distributing have become more common, according to the report. \nIn the report, authors Murray Aitken, executive director of the QuintilesIMS Institute, and Michael Kleinrock, research director, write that invoice spending on medications -- the amount pharmacy or hospital customers paid distributors -- in 2016 grew more slowly than in the previous year. \nSpending grew by 4.8% in 2016, slowing significantly from 8.9% in 2015. \nThe report says that was largely due to smaller price increases for name-brand products, fewer new products, and lower spending on hepatitis C treatments in 2016. \nThe report estimates that 226,000 new patients were treated with hepatitis C medicines in 2016, down by 23,000 from the year before. The drugs are potentially curing 13% to 22% of the 3 million to 5 million infected patients in the United States, the authors write. \nThe report predicts spending will continue to lessen in the next 5 years. \n\"The outlook for medicine spending through 2021 is for mid-single digit growth driven by further clusters of innovative treatments, offset by a rising impact from brands facing generic or biosimilar competition,\" the authors write.

Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Career couch potatoes, take heart: Just one hour a week of any kind of exercise may lower your long-term risk for depression , new research suggests. \nThe finding comes from a fresh analysis of a Norwegian survey that tracked exercise habits, along with depression and anxiety risk, among nearly 34,000 adults. \nAfter a closer look at the data, a team of British, Australian and Norwegian analysts determined that people who engage in just an hour of exercise per week -- regardless of intensity level -- face a 44 percent lower risk for developing depression over the course of a decade than those who never exercise at all. \n\"The key finding from this study is that doing even a small amount of regular exercise seems to protect adults against future depression ,\" said study author Samuel Harvey. \n\"This was not a case of more is better; the vast majority of the mental health benefits of exercise was realized when individuals moved from doing no regular activity to 1 or 2 hours per week,\" Harvey explained. \n\"Also, the mental health benefits were there regardless of the intensity of the physical activity,\" he added. \"There is great evidence that there are many physical health benefits to more regular exercise, but the mental health benefits leveled out after 2 hours.\" \nHarvey is an associate professor with the School of Psychiatry at the University of New South Wales, in Sydney, Australia. \"The important point here is that any type of physical activity -- even just walking -- had similar levels of mental health benefits,\" he concluded. \nThe original survey was launched between 1984 and 1986. In that timeframe, participants (who were about 45 years old, on average) underwent physical exams, and filled out lifestyle and medical questionnaires. Mental health assessments were also completed. \nThe Norwegian pollsters conducted a follow-up survey between 1995 and 1997 among roughly two-thirds of the original participants. \nAbout 7 percent of those tracked through 1997 had developed depression, while about 9 percent had developed clinical levels of anxiety , the findings showed. \nExercise did not appear to have any impact on anxiety risk. But investigators found that, regardless of gender or activity intensity, regular exercise lasting at least an hour per week was linked to a lower risk for developing depression over time. \nThe study authors calculated that roughly 12 percent of the depression cases might have been prevented if those who had become depressed had previously routinely engaged in one hour of low-intensity activity a week. \nExercising more than one hour per week did not, however, appear to substantially decrease depression risk even further; the lion's share of the protective impact appeared to max out at the one-hour mark. \nBut as to how and why such a minimal amount of regular exercise might help stave off depression, the study team wrote that \"the bulk of the observed protective effect remains unexplained.\" And the study did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and lower risk of depression. \nHarvey and his colleagues reported their observations in the Oct. 3 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry . \nSimon Rego, chief psychologist at Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, said that \"there are probably many mechanisms at play that could explain how this works. But it doesn't have the same effect on anxiety, so we just don't know yet exactly what's happening.\" \nHowever, Rego added, \"What we do know is that what they've identified is a very low bar of entry. We're talking about just an hour of activity a week. And it doesn't have to be vigorous or intense. You don't need to go out to a spin class or sign up for a running club. This could just be getting people who aren't moving much to just increase their daily walking habit. That's all.\" \nSo, he explained, \"while we don't have all the definitive answers yet, this is a very promising finding because this is something many people may find easy to do.\" Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

So why is the FDA keeping it locked away from women who need it?\" Julia Kaye, an attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, told the wire service. \"The FDA's unique restrictions on medication abortion are not grounded in science -- this is just abortion stigma made law.\" \nThe restrictions, in place since the pill became available in 2000, also state that all providers of the drug must go through a special certification process, the AP said. \nWomen using the abortion pill generally take it in the privacy of their home. Kaye told the wire service that the legal case \"is primarily about where a woman must be standing when she's handed the abortion pill that's been prescribed to her.\" \n\"The FDA restriction defies common sense,\" she said. \"There's no medical issue in whether she's handed the pill at a pharmacy or at a clinic.\" \nThe FDA did issue new guidelines for the use of Mifeprex last year, but the FDA confirmed this week that the agency still feels the restrictions are necessary, the AP reported. The FDA added that it does not comment on pending lawsuits. \nA commentary published earlier this year in the New England Journal of Medicine said that 19 deaths have been reported to the FDA among the more than 3 million women who have used Mifeprex. That rate is lower than it is for pregnancy-related deaths among women, the wire service said. Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay. All rights reserved.

That compared with $10,917 for a brand-name prepackaged version of the same medication. \n\"Everyone is talking about how to pay for health care, but few talk about why health care in the United States is so expensive. Uncontrollable drug prices are a major cause of this trend,\" study co-author Andrew Beam said in a Harvard news release. He's an instructor of biomedical informatics. \nThe two medications have the same active ingredients and are clinically interchangeable, according to the research team. \nThe investigators' analysis of costs and pregnancy outcomes among more than 3,800 women treated with the drugs also found no statistically significant difference in the rate of preterm births -- nearly 24 percent in the brand-name group and about 25 percent among women who received the compounded drug. \nThe researchers estimated that the annual cost of treating all medically eligible women with the brand-name version would be more than $1.4 billion, compared with $27.5 million for the compounded version. \n\"This case is emblematic of a systemic disorder that is not unique to one particular drug, class of drugs or manufacturer. There is no transparent and systematic link between the price, or cost, of a drug and its actual value or impact in terms of health and disease,\" said study co-author Isaac Kohane, chair of the biomedical informatics department at Harvard. \nThe researchers acknowledged that mixing drug ingredients to order -- compounding -- carries a slightly higher risk of contamination than mass-production drugs. \nThe study was published Oct. 2 in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine . \n-- Robert Preidt Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Latest Cancer News \nOverall, advances in care have led to a 39 percent drop in breast cancer deaths of between 1989 and 2015, according to new research from the American Cancer Society (ACS). \nOne specialist who works with breast cancer patients daily was heartened by the news. \n\"Early screening and better treatments are finally starting to pay off with better outcomes,\" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \nHowever, the ACS was quick to point out that not every segment of Americans benefited equally. Despite some closure of the racial \"gap\" in breast cancer survival, black women are still more likely to die of the disease than their white peers, the study found. \nEven though the rate of breast cancer diagnosis was slightly lower among black women than whites between 2010 and 2014, over about the same time period, black breast cancer patients were still 42 percent more likely to die of the disease than their white peers. \nAccording to breast cancer specialist Dr. Cynara Coomer, that's probably due to a combination of factors. Black patients are more prone to be affected by aggressive, tough-to-treat breast tumors, she noted. But they also often lack access to the targeted treatments that can best fight these tumors. \nSo, when it comes to surviving breast cancer, \"there remains a disparity between black women and white women across the country,\" said Coomer, who directs the Florina Rusi-Marke Comprehensive Breast Center at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City. \nThe vast majority of breast cancers are diagnosed among women aged 50 and older, the ACS found, and older women account for most deaths from the disease as well. \nStill, race seemed to play a role here, as well. The median age of diagnosis for women overall in the United States is 62, but the disease tends to strike black women at a younger age, the report showed. \nThe median age for breast cancer deaths is 68, but black patients died younger -- at 62, on average. \nAll of this means that, overall, breast cancer kills more black women than white women in the United States. \nThere was reason to hope, however, because this health disparity may be stabilizing in some parts of the country, the ACS said. For example, breast cancer death rates among black women ranged from 22 percent in Nevada to 66 percent in Louisiana, the report found. \nBut in seven states the researchers saw no significant difference in death rates between black and white patients -- showing that the racial gap can be closed. \nWhile genetics and differences in overall health play a big role in the survival gap between blacks and whites, so do \"social and structural factors,\" said Carol DeSantis, of the ACS's surveillance and health services research branch. \n\"Increasing access to health care to low-income populations\" might shrink this racial gap even further across the country, she explained. \nCoomer agreed, saying that black women with aggressive tumors, in particular, \"would be better served with health care teams or centers that provide comprehensive breast treatment.\" \nAccording to Bernik, progress is being made. \n\"The fact that we are finally seeing a close in the gap between our excellent outcomes between black and white women is also encouraging,\" she said, \"especially since black women are more likely to be diagnosed with the more aggressive triple-negative breast cancers.\" \nExcluding skin cancers , breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among American women, trailing only lung cancer . It's estimated that 252,710 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017 and 40,610 will die from the disease. \nThe research was published Oct. 3 in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and Breast Cancer Facts & Figures . \n-- Mary Elizabeth Dallas Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Latest Cancer News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nThat doesn't mean too much weight is causing all these cancer cases, just that there's some kind of still-to-be explained association, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nStill, the study findings suggest that being obese or overweight was associated with cancer cases involving more than 630,000 Americans in 2014, and this includes 13 types of cancer . \n\"That obesity and overweight are affecting cancers may be surprising to many Americans. The awareness of some cancers being associated with obesity and overweight is not yet widespread,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC deputy director, said during a midday media briefing. \nThe 13 cancers include: brain cancer ; multiple myeloma ; cancer of the esophagus ; postmenopausal breast cancer ; cancers of the thyroid, gallbladder, stomach, liver , pancreas, kidney, ovaries, uterus and colon, the researchers said. \nSpeaking at the news conference, Dr. Lisa Richardson, director of CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, said early evidence indicates that losing weight can lower the risk for some cancers. \nAccording to the new report from the CDC and the U.S. National Cancer Institute, these 13 obesity-related cancers made up about 40 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States in 2014. \nAlthough the rate of new cancer cases has decreased since the 1990s, increases in overweight and obesity-related cancers are likely slowing this progress, the researchers said. \nOf the 630,000 Americans diagnosed with a cancer associated with overweight or obesity in 2014, about two out of three occurred in adults aged 50 to 74, the researchers found. \nExcluding colon cancer , the rate of obesity-related cancer increased by 7 percent between 2005 and 2014. During the same time, rates of non-obesity-related cancers dropped, the findings showed. \nIn 2013-2014, about two out of three American adults were overweight or obese, according to the report. \nFor the study, researchers analyzed 2014 cancer data from the United States Cancer Statistics report and data from 2005 to 2014. \nKey findings include: Of all cancers, 55 percent in women and 24 percent in men were associated with overweight and obesity. Blacks and whites had higher rates of weight-related cancer than other racial or ethnic groups. Black men and American Indian/Alaska Native men had higher rates of cancer than white men. Cancers linked to obesity increased 7 percent between 2005 and 2014, but colon cancer decreased 23 percent. Screening for colon cancer is most likely the reason for that cancer's continued decline, Schuchat said. Cancers not linked to obesity dropped 13 percent. Except for colon cancer, cancers tied to overweight and obesity increased among those younger than 75. \nThe new report was published online Oct. 3 in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report . \nDr. Farhad Islami is strategic director of cancer surveillance research for the American Cancer Society. \nHe said it's \"important to note that only a fraction of the cancers included in the calculation in this report are actually caused by excess body weight.\" \nAccording to Islami, \"many are attributable to other known risk factors, like smoking , while for many others, the cause is unknown. Obesity is more strongly associated with some cancers than others.\" \nThe World Cancer Research Fund estimates that \"20 percent of all cancers in the United States are caused by a combination of excess body weight, physical inactivity, excess alcohol, and poor nutrition . The American Cancer Society is currently doing its own extensive calculation of the numbers and proportions of cancer cases attributable to excess body weight, the results of which will be published soon,\" he said.

Latest Infectious Disease News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nPuppies are transmitting potentially deadly Campylobacter bacteria infections via contaminated poop to the humans who handle them, with 55 people now sickened in an outbreak reaching across 12 states. \nIn the latest update from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency says cases rose from 39 in mid-September to 55 reported by Tuesday. \n\"Evidence suggests that puppies sold through Petland are a likely source of this outbreak,\" the CDC said in a news release issued Sept 11. \"Petland is cooperating with public health and animal health officials to address this outbreak.\" \nSince mid-September, \"four more hospitalizations have been reported, bringing the total to 13,\" the CDC said in its Tuesday update, but so far \"no deaths have been reported.\" \nCampylobacter infections linked to the puppies have now been reported between September 2016 and October 2017 in Florida, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming, the CDC said. \nCampylobacter is a bacteria that causes people to develop diarrhea (sometimes bloody), cramping, abdominal pain and fever within two to five days of exposure to the organism, said Dr. Sophia Jan, director of general pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center, in New Hyde Park, N.Y. \nThis is a common cause of diarrhea in the United States, she said. \n\"The illness typically lasts about a week without treatment,\" Jan said. But for people with compromised immune systems, campylobacter infections can be life-threatening, she added. \nMost cases in humans occur from eating raw or undercooked chicken, or eating foods that have been cross-contaminated by infected poultry products, Jan noted. \nHowever, humans can get infected from contact with the stool of an infected puppy, she added. \nMany of the people sickened in this outbreak were Petland employees, while others had either bought a Petland puppy, shopped at Petland or visited someone who had purchased a puppy from Petland, the CDC said. \nInfected dogs may or may not show signs of illness, such as diarrhea , vomiting or a fever , so it's important to take precautions when around dogs, the CDC says. \nTo prevent catching campylobacter from dogs, the CDC advises that you: Wash your hands thoroughly after touching dogs, their poop, or their food. Take extra care that children wash their hands carefully after playing with puppies or dogs. Pick up and dispose of dog poop, especially in areas where children might play.

Latest Prevention & Wellness News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \n\"Across the country, we found that voters in counties with poor public health shifted dramatically towards the Republican candidate in 2016, compared with 2012, an effect that was particularly strong in states where the results changed Electoral College votes,\" said study author Dr. Jason Wasfy, from the division of cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \n\"Although we cannot determine causality from these results, the findings raise the possibility of a role for public health status in determining voting behavior,\" Wasfy said in a hospital news release. \nPrevious studies have shown that poor mental and physical health, particularly among older people, keeps voters from casting their ballots in political elections. \nSurprising shifts among voters in several states in 2016, including Texas and Wisconsin, prompted researchers to examine the potential effect that public health may have had on voting patterns. \nThe research team from the hospital and Massachusetts Institute of Technology reviewed voter turnout and election results for more than 3,000 counties. That's about 95 percent of American counties. \nThis information was compared to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health information compiled by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Specifically, the researchers considered health issues, such as the prevalence of obesity and diabetes , lack of food, teen birth rates and death rates. \nThe study showed 88 percent of counties shifted towards Donald Trump in 2016 compared to Mitt Romney in 2012. The counties that shifted toward Trump tended to be rural, predominantly white, lower-income and in the West and Midwest. \nThe counties that leaned towards Trump had less violent crime but faced higher teen birth rates and age-adjusted death rates than other counties. These counties also had fewer primary care doctors per person and other health care resources than the voters who didn't favor Trump, the analysis showed. The researchers suggested that shift among these voters contributed to a Republican victory in 2016. \n\"Even after adjusting for factors such as race, income and education, public health seems to have an additional, independent association with this voting shift towards Trump,\" Wasfy said. \n\"It's critical to interpret our results as reflecting county-wide ecological associations, rather than individual voting behavior. More than anything, I think these results demonstrate that health is a real issue that can affect people's lives and their decisions. We all need to focus on improving public health as a means of improving people's lives,\" he added. \nThe study was published recently in PLOS ONE . \n-- Mary Elizabeth Dallas Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Latest Pregnancy News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nAmerican women are, on average, 11 miles from an abortion clinic. But New Yorkers are within 3.2 miles of a clinic, while Wyoming residents must travel nearly 170 miles to access these services, according to researchers from the Guttmacher Institute in New York City. \n\"How far a woman has to travel for an abortion is a key measure of access, alongside stigma, restrictive laws and financial constraints,\" said study author Jonathan Bearak. \n\"Our findings illustrate the vast differences in access to abortion mapped across the U.S., with women in remote, rural areas facing the longest journeys for an abortion,\" Bearak added. \nThe study results were published Oct. 3 in The Lancet Public Health . \nLaws in 14 states require that women have in-person counseling followed by an 18- to 72-hour waiting period before an abortion, the researchers noted. This can pose a substantial barrier \"as women in these areas may also need to travel to and from the clinic twice,\" Bearak said in a journal news release. \nFor the study, researchers mapped the population of women of childbearing age and then looked at publicly accessible abortion clinics. They calculated how far the women would have to travel in each state and county. \nThe researchers found that on average in 2014: Women in 23 states were within 15 miles of a clinic. In 16 states, the average distance was within 29 miles, while women in eight states averaged 30 to 89 miles away from an abortion clinic. Some women in three states are more than 90 miles away from an abortion clinic. In remote areas of South Dakota, an abortion clinic could be more than 330 miles away. Between 2011 and 2014, the average distance to an abortion clinic increased by at least 30 miles for women living in remote counties in Texas, Iowa, Montana and Missouri. All of these states, except for Iowa, tightened laws restricting access to abortion, according to the study. On the flip side, the average distance to an abortion clinic for women in Kansas and Maine was significantly reduced. \nNearly half of pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and 42 percent of these end in an abortion, the authors noted. \n\"This study tells only part of the story. For women seeking specific types of providers, such as those who accept Medicaid, do abortions at later gestations, or are hospital-based, the distance might be even longer,\" said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco, in a commentary linked to the study. \n\"Because provider availability decreases with each week of gestation, even a week's delay can reduce the number of providers substantially,\" Upadhyay wrote. \n-- Mary Elizabeth Dallas Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

The organization provides this additional information: Screening can help find lung cancer at an early stage when it is easier to treat. A low ( radiation ) dose CT scan may reduce your chances of dying from lung cancer. This imaging process takes a series of pictures as you lie on a table that slides in and out of a scanning machine. Lung cancer screening is not suitable for everyone, but may be recommended for those at high risk for developing the disease. Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay. All rights reserved.

But the process is fairly painless, takes only about 20 minutes and could help save a life. \nThe American Red Cross explains the different types of blood donation: Whole blood -- The most common and quickest type of donation, involving a pint of whole blood. The donation is typically separated into transfusable components, including red cells , plasma and platelets. Red cells -- Red blood cells are the most frequently transfused part of blood. In this type of collection, only the red blood cells are collected and most of the platelets and plasma are returned to the donor. Platelet -- Platelet donations take longer than whole-blood donations. During this procedure, an apheresis machine collects platelets and returns red cells and the majority of the plasma back to the donor. Platelets are an important part of some cancer treatments and organ donation. Plasma -- For this type of donation, only plasma is collected. Red cells and platelets are returned to the donor.

Latest Infectious Disease News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nAs scientists prepare for a mission to Mars in the coming decades, the health and safety of astronauts is a top priority. In this new research, scientists honed in on the microorganisms that would be living in close quarters with crews aboard spacecraft. \nResearchers from Germany, the United Kingdom and Austria, led by the German Aerospace Center, enlisted a crew of six male \"Marsonauts.\" They lived inside a mock spacecraft in Moscow from June 2010 to November 2011. \nDuring the mock Mars mission, the researchers monitored how the composition of bacteria changed over time. What they found was that the diversity of germs dropped dramatically during the equivalent of a space flight to Mars. \n\"Until now, little was known about the influence of long-term confinement on the microorganisms that live inside habitats that may one day be used to travel to other planets, and whether the structure of the microbiota changes with time,\" said study author Petra Schwendner, from the University of Edinburgh. \n\"Ours is the first comprehensive long-time study that investigates the microbial load, diversity and dynamics in a closed habitat -- a mock-up spacecraft -- for 520 days, the full duration of a simulated flight to Mars,\" she said. \nDuring the mock mission, the crew never left the closed habitat. They were also subjected to a regimented lifestyle that future Mars astronauts will face. This involved a strict diet and schedule, which included cleaning the habitat and conducting scientific experiments. \nThe crew also collected 360 microbial samples from the air and various surfaces at 18 intervals. \nThe study showed communal areas, sleep areas, the gym, and the bathroom had the greatest volume and diversity of bacteria while the medical space had the least. \nThe researchers noted, however, that microbial diversity aboard the \"spacecraft\" declined dramatically during the mission. \nThe findings were published Oct. 3 in the journal Microbiome . \n\"In addition to potential health risks for the crew, some of these microorganisms could have a negative impact on spacecraft, as they grow on and might damage spacecraft material,\" Schwendner said in a journal news release. \n\"To ensure the systems' stability, countermeasures may be required to avoid development of highly resistant, adapted microorganisms, and a complete loss of microbial [germ} diversity,\" she said. \nThe crew was the main source of human-associated bacteria within the habitat, but the prolonged confinement seemed to have the most significant effect on the bacterial community, the researchers found. \nThe study authors suggested their findings provide insight on habitat maintenance and could help scientists develop strategies to ensure a healthy environment for astronauts during future deep space missions. \n-- Mary Elizabeth Dallas Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

By Joan McClusky HealthDay Reporter \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- More Americans are having trouble getting a good night's sleep , a national health survey found. Latest Sleep News \nAnd the number of people who use prescription sleeping pills in the quest for shuteye continues to increase -- currently about 4 percent of Americans, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nBut are they safe? And are they even effective? \nResults of studies done on the health hazards of sleeping pills vary widely, from one that found barely any elevated risk to another that found the risk of death for users is three times higher than it is for people who don't take them. \nResearch published in the American Journal of Public Health confirms that fatal overdoses are a concern. There are also possible side effects and dependency problems to consider. \nPlus, according to Consumer Reports , over the long term, sleeping pills might not even bring their intended results. \nIf you're taking sleeping pills, it's important to only use them with your doctor's OK and according to his or her instructions. If you take them too often, they can actually make your sleep problems worse. \nSo, how can you know if you're abusing sleeping pills? Here are some warning signs: You're taking extra doses to see if that works better, or a second pill in the middle of the night if you wake up. You're taking a prescription sleeping pill AND an over-the-counter sedation product at the same time. You're using sleeping pills to treat anxiety . You're taking sleeping pills during the day or when you need to be alert. You've taken a sleeping pill every night for more than 7 to 10 days, or several times a week for weeks or months. \nIf you have any of these red flags, it's time to talk to your doctor about a new plan for getting quality sleep , including regular exercise and cognitive behavior therapy to harness the power of your mind.

These include cold-weather sports, like cross-country skiing, and ice hockey, and endurance sports, like soccer or long-distance running . Tips for exercising with asthma \nIt might be helpful to talk to a doctor before starting an exercise routine. This is especially important with asthma symptoms that worsen with exercise. A doctor experienced in the management of asthma can help find the best exercises and asthma medications . Many people with asthma benefit from taking a short-acting bronchodilator (such as albuterol [Ventolin, Proventil, Proventil-HFA , AccuNeb , Vospire , ProAir]) about 15 minutes before starting exercise. In extremely cold or hot weather, or if there is a high level of pollution, it may best to exercise indoors. This also applies to patients with both asthma and allergies when the pollen count is high. \nHere are some good tips for exercising with asthma: Warm up first. Try to breathe through the nose as much as possible. Wear a scarf or mask over the nose and mouth in cold weather. Avoid outdoor exercise when pollen counts are high if allergies are present with asthma. Avoid exercising outdoors if air pollution is high. Do not exercise when sick. Include a cool-down routine after exercise. Do not over exert during exercise. Carry an albuterol inhaler for rescue if needed. \nExercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle -- even with asthma. Aim to work out for about 30 minutes, four to five days a week. Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle may negative impact asthma. Therefore, exercise is an important part of a healthy treatment for asthma.

In general, dry coughs and stress coughs are often caused by noninfectious irritants. Some chronic coughs are due to long-term mucus production and/or irritating agents like cigarette smoke. Other coughs are caused by allergies bothering underlying lung disease. Some, but not all, productive coughs are caused by infectious agents as are whooping cough and croup. Coughing up blood or blood mixed with sputum is best evaluated by a health-care professional to determine the underlying cause(s). This combination is usually considered a medical emergency. \nThe underlying cause of chronic coughs should be investigated by a doctor. When is a cough no longer contagious? \nThe answer to this question is tricky. Coughs are not contagious, but certain underlying diseases that produce a cough are contagious, and can be spread by droplets formed during coughing. Correspondingly, when the underlying disease process is no longer contagious, the cough no longer produces infectious droplets. \nThe key is that coughs are signs or symptoms of underlying problems, and the cough itself is not contagious. How are coughs spread? \nCoughs associated with non-infectious causes (such as dust, chemical irritants and smoking ), and are not spread from person-to-person. \nCoughs due to infectious diseases may seem like they are contagious and spread to others by person-to-person contact. However, the cough itself may or may not occur in another person with the same infection. If the infection causes cough and other symptoms in another person then, it will seem as though the cough was \"spread,\" but the actual spread of symptoms including cough would be due to the spread of the underlying infection, not the cough itself. So, microbes can be transmitted from one person to another by coughing to produce droplets that carry pass them on. When should I seek medical care for cough? \nIn many instances, short-term cough (less than seven days duration) usually requires no medical care. However, the following list of problems associated with a cough should be investigated by a health-care professional: a cough lasting at least a week without improving chills and/or nighttime coughing fits a fever and a cough that lasts at least three or more days a deep cough that produces a lot of mucus and/or bloody mucus \nEmergency care should be sought if the coughing includes any one or more of the following: shortness of breath chest tightness coughing up and/or vomiting blood (possible signs of internal bleeding due to bleeding ulcers or other significant causes) \nCoughs can be irritating no matter what type of cough they are. Consequently, people want them to either stop or be markedly reduced. There are many over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and home remedies that can suppress or stop cough, and usually are relatively safe to use to treat acute coughs. \nHowever, individuals that are pregnant and other individuals that have high blood pressure should consult their health-care professional before using coughs treatments. Some treatments may not be advisable or safe. \nIndividuals that try OTC drugs and home remedies that provide no cough relief should contact their health-care professional to determine if there is an underlying cause that needs treatment before trying to diminish the symptoms of coughing.

Because bacteria and viruses (and occasionally, fungi) are the cause of most sinus infections , some experts say that the bacteria, viruses, or fungi can be transferred from person-to\u2013person, and occasionally cause sinus infections . Other experts say that sinus infections, although caused by bacteria and viruses, occur because the conditions in the individual's sinuses are optimal for infection. Moreover, infection can be caused bacteria, viruses, or fungi that are already present in a person so that person-to-person transfer is not required for them to develop. However, the majority of doctors think that most people do not transmit sinus infections except in rare instances, and conclude that sinus infections are not contagious . \nStill, there is widespread agreement that bacteria, fungi and/or viruses are transmitted from person-to-person (contagious) even if the disease, sinusitis , is not. It's recommended that individuals with sinus infections avoid direct contact (for example, kissing) with those that are more prone to infection like infants, the elderly, and those who have weakened immune systems to reduce the chance of transferring bacteria, fungi, and viruses to other people as they may cause problems other than sinus infections.

Cipro dosage For most infections the recommended oral dose for adults is 250-750 mg (immediate release tablets) every 12 hours or 500-1000 mg (extended release tablets) every 24 hours. The usual intravenous dose is 200-400 mg every 8-12 hours. Flagyl dosage Metronidazole may be taken orally with or without food. In the hospital, metronidazole can be administered intravenously to treat serious infections. The liver is primarily responsible for eliminating metronidazole from the body, and doses may need to be reduced in patients with liver disease and abnormal liver function . \nVarious metronidazole regimens are used. Some examples are listed below. Amebic dysentery: 750 mg orally 3 times daily for 5-10 days Amebic liver abscess: 500-750 mg orally three times daily for 5-10 days Anaerobic infections: 7.5 mg/kg orally or by injection every 6 hours for 7 to 10 days not to exceed 4 grams daily. Bacterial vaginosis: 750 mg (extended release tablets) once daily for 7 days or 500 mg twice daily for 7 days or 2 g single dose or one applicator-full of 0.75% vaginal gel, once or twice daily for 5 days. Clostridium difficile infection: 250-500 mg orally 4 times daily or 500-750 orally 3 times daily Giardia : 250 mg orally three times daily for 5 days Helicobacter pylori : 800-1500 mg orally daily for several days in combination with other drugs. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): 500 mg orally twice daily for 14 days in combination with other drugs. Trichomoniasis : 2 g single dose or 1 g twice Rosacea : apply topical gel 0.75-1% once daily What drug interactions occur with Cipro vs. Flagyl? Cipro drug interactions Ciprofloxacin administered together with theophylline ( Respbid , Slo-Bid , Theo-24 , Theolair ) can lead to elevated, toxic blood levels of theophylline. Theophylline is used to open airways in the treatment of asthma . Toxic levels of theophylline can lead to seizures, and disturbances in heart rhythm. If concurrent use of ciprofloxacin and theophylline cannot be avoided, frequent blood tests to monitor theophylline blood levels are recommended. Ciprofloxacin increases the effect of tizanidine (Zanaflex) that is used to treat muscle spasticity . Therefore, the two drugs should not be combined. Iron salts (for example, ferrous sulfate) may reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin because of formation of a ciprofloxacin-iron complex that is not absorbable. Antacids also may reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin. If patients are receiving iron salts or antacids and ciprofloxacin, the ciprofloxacin should be given two hours before or six hours after the iron salt or antacid. Ciprofloxacin may increase the blood thinning effect of warfarin ( Coumadin , Jantoven ). The reason for this is unknown. Anticoagulant activity should be monitored after starting or stopping ciprofloxacin. Sevelamer ( Renagel ) may reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin and possibly reduce the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin. Milk and orange juice also may reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin, as with iron and antacids, should be given two hours before or six hours after milk or orange juice. Administration of ciprofloxacin with diabetic medications (for example glyburide [Micronase, Diabeta, Glynase, Prestab]) may lead to severe low blood glucose . Ciprofloxacin may increase blood concentrations of sildenafil ( Viagra ) that is used for treating erectile dysfunction . This combination should be avoided if possible. Patients taking Cipro, Cipro XR can develop sensitivity of the skin to direct sunlight ( photosensitivity ) and should avoid exposure to sunlight or use sunblock. Fluoroquinolones worsen low blood glucose levels when combined with sulfonylureas, for example, glyburide (Micronase, Diabeta, Glynase, Prestab). Flagyl drug interactions Alcohol should be avoided because metronidazole and alcohol together can cause severe nausea, vomiting, cramps, flushing, and headache . Metronidazole can increase the blood thinning effects of warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) and increase the risk of bleeding probably by reducing the breakdown of warfarin. Cimetidine ( Tagamet ) increases blood levels of metronidazole while cholestyramine ( Questran , Questran Light ) reduces blood levels of metronidazole by reducing its absorption. Metronidazole should not be combined with amprenavir ( Agenerase ) for treating human immunodeficiency disease (infection with HIV ) because amprenavir contains propylene glycol. Metronidazole blocks the breakdown of propylene glycol in the liver leading to accumulation of propylene glycol in blood. Accumulation of propylene glycol could cause seizures, increased heart rate, and lead to kidney failure. Metronidazole increases the blood levels of carbamazepine ( Tegretol , Tegretol XR, Equetro , Carbatrol ), lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid ) and cyclosporine though unknown mechanisms. Serious reactions may occur if these drugs are taken with metronidazole. Quick Guide Symptoms of Mono: Infectious Mononucleosis Treatment Are Cipro and Flagyl safe to take if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding? Doctors suggest that should not use Cipro if you are pregnant or breastfeeding because they do not know if it is safe. Flagyl is not used in early pregnancy because of potential adverse effects on the fetus. Metronidazole is excreted in breast milk . Females who are nursing , because of potential adverse effects on the newborn , should not use metronidazole.

Doctor's response \nBacteria and viruses can cause middle ear infections . Bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas, and Moraxella account for about 85% of cases of acute otitis media . Viruses account for the remaining 15%. Affected infants under six weeks of age tend to have infections from a variety of different bacteria in the middle ear. What are the risk factors for ear infection? Bottlefeeding: The position of the breastfeeding child is better than that of the bottlefeeding position in terms of the function of the Eustachian tube that leads into the middle ear. If an infant needs to be bottlfed, it's better to hold the the baby rather than allowing them to lie down with the bottle. Ideally, they should not take the bottle to bed. (In addition to increasing the chance for acute infection, falling asleep with milk in the mouth enhances the risk of tooth decay .) Upper respiratory tract infection: Children often develop upper respiratory infections prior to developing this type of infection. Exposure to groups of children (as in child care centers) results in more frequent colds, and therefore more earaches. Exposure to air with irritants , such as tobacco smoke Birth defects: Children with cleft palate or Down syndrome are more prone to ear infections . Eustachian tube problems: Any problems with the Eustachian tubes (for example, blockage, malformation, inflammation) will increase the risk of infection. If the individual has allergies he or she may have swelling and blockage of one or both Eustachian tubes. Immunosuppressed: Individuals with suppressed immunosuppression are at increased risk for ear infections . Ear infections later in childhood: Children who have episodes of acute infections before six months of age tend to have more later in childhood. \nRead our full medical article for more information on ear infection causes, symptoms, and treatments.

A combination of elements, including genetic predisposition and environmental factors, are involved. It is common for psoriasis to be found in members of the same family. Defects in immune regulation (white blood cells called T cells mistakenly target healthy cells instead of attacking foreign substances) and the control of inflammation are thought to play major roles. Despite research over the past 30 years, the \"master switch\" that turns on psoriasis is still a mystery. \nA person cannot catch it from someone else, and one cannot pass it to anyone else by skin-to-skin contact. Directly touching someone with psoriasis every day will never transmit the condition. \nAlthough psoriasis is not contagious from person to person, there is a known hereditary tendency. Therefore, family history is very helpful in making the diagnosis. \nMost patients with psoriasis seem to be overweight . Since there is a predisposition for those patients to develop cardiovascular disease and diabetes , it is suggested strongly that they try to maintain a normal body weight. Although evidence is sparse, it has been suggested that slender patients are more likely to respond to treatment. \nAlthough dietary studies are notoriously difficult to perform and interpret, it seems likely that a diet whose fat content is composed of polyunsaturated oils like olive oil and fish oil is beneficial for psoriasis. The so-called Mediterranean diet is an example. \nFor more information, read our full medical article on psoriasis REFERENCES: \"Psoriasis in children: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\" UpToDate.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T01:07:40.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4343f63f1a648b8b888a07153098119d03a7bace", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXJy8QueI_F2U6pCJzyXavjMaN7LkWrrUlzlHesSCf46OHGQ6n.O5m6ahKypMxVh81eOCcoLNxBL5XpNF3xQ_O", "site_full": "www.medicinenet.com", "site": "medicinenet.com", "site_section": "http://www.medicinenet.com/rss/general/womens_health.xml", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "MedicineNet Womens Health General", "title": "Coming Soon: A Faster Test for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "title_full": "Coming Soon: A Faster Test for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "published": "2017-10-05T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.medicinenet.com/images/facebook/medicinenet/fb-mnet-default.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1836, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4343f63f1a648b8b888a07153098119d03a7bace", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXJy8QueI_F2U6pCJzyXavjMaN7LkWrrUlzlHesSCf46OHGQ6n.O5m6ahKypMxVh81eOCcoLNxBL5XpNF3xQ_O", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Coming Soon: A Faster Test for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "text": "home / women's health center / women's health a-z list / a faster test for antibiotics against utis? article Coming Soon: A Faster Test for Antibiotics Against UTIs? \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) plague millions of Americans each year. Now, researchers say they've developed a test that can tell in minutes whether or not a particular antibiotic can clear up the problem. Latest Womens Health News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nThe issue is an important one, doctors say, since many of the bacteria behind UTIs have grown resistant to certain antibiotics. And, left untreated, these infections can have serious effects, especially in the frail and elderly. \n\"We live in an era of multidrug-resistant bacteria, so-called 'superbugs' that can cause life-threatening infections,\" said infectious disease specialist Dr. Sunil Sood, who reviewed the new study. \n\"Modern molecular techniques to distinguish bacteria that are resistant from those that are susceptible to common antibiotics could be lifesaving,\" said Sood. He is chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y. \nAccording to the study authors, current urine tests can rapidly spot a UTI , but it can still take days for the exact germs -- and the proper antibiotic to use against them -- to be identified. \nIn the new study, researchers led by Nathan Schoepp, of the California Institute of Technology, developed a new way of analyzing germs in urine samples. Instead of isolating germs and waiting for them to grow, the researchers used a \"DNA amplification\" technique to analyze the bacteria's genome, or \"genetic blueprint.\" \nThe investigators tested the new screen out on 51 urine samples containing either antibiotic-resistant or antibiotic-susceptible strains of bacteria. \nReporting in the Oct. 4 issue of Science Translational Medicine , Schoepp's team said the new test can render results in less than 30 minutes. Those results confirmed that urine samples held germs that were either susceptible or resistant to two common antibiotics: ciprofloxacin ( Cipro ) and nitrofurantoin ( Macrobid , Furadantin and Macrodantin ). \nAccording to the researchers, the test might also prove useful in other areas of treatment of infectious disease. \nSood said that, if this work pans out, it could be a real advance in care. \n\"The technique used by Schoepp and colleagues has the potential to identify such bacteria within the time frame of an office or emergency room visit,\" he explained. \"If further developed, this method could help doctors to more rapidly treat infections with the right antibiotics.\" \nDr. Howard Selinger directs family medicine at Quinnipiac University's Frank D. Netter MD School of Medicine in Hamden, Conn. He agreed that the new test could speed care, but said cost is a concern, too. \n\"We must demonstrate that directed therapy delivers better value, by improving quality and lowering overall cost,\" Selinger said. \"This will allow for insurance coverage and not cause patients to bear the brunt of the cost of this new technology.\" \n-- Randy Dotinga Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

It requires an outsized amount of oxygen and other nutrients,\" said Fargo, who wasn't involved with the study. \"Because of that, there's a very, very rich blood delivery system in the brain. Anything that happens to compromise that is going to compromise the overall health and function of the brain.\" \nBecause of that, it stands to reason that long-term exposure to high blood pressure could leave one more vulnerable to dementia as they enter old age, Gilsanz said. \nGilsanz and her colleagues reviewed the records of more than 5,600 patients of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care system, tracking them from 1996 onward for an average 15 years to see who developed dementia. \nThey found that people with high blood pressure in their 30s did not appear to have any increased risk of dementia. \nBut women who developed high blood pressure in their 40s did have an increased risk of dementia, even after the researchers adjusted for other factors like smoking , diabetes and excess weight. \nHowever, the study did not prove that early high blood pressure caused dementia risk to rise in women, just that there was an association. \nMen did not have a similar risk from high blood pressure in their 40s, but that could be because they were more likely to die before they grew old enough to suffer from dementia, Gilsanz noted. \nOther factors such as genetic differences, lifestyle differences and sex-specific hormones also might separate men and women when it comes to dementia risk associated with high blood pressure, Fargo said. \n\"It's really interesting to see there was an association among women but not men,\" Gilsanz said. \"Given that women have higher rates of dementia than men, understanding why this may be is a large area of interest for us. Future research should really look at sex-specific pathways that might be at play, to disentangle the risk factors for men and women.\" \nFargo said it makes sense that people with long-term exposure to high blood pressure would be more likely to develop dementia. \n\"Your dementia risk is really a lifelong thing,\" Fargo said. \"People think about dementia in late life, because that's when it's common to see the clinical symptoms. But everything that is setting you up for cognitive decline is occurring throughout your life.\" \nBut Fargo sees this as an opportunity, given that high blood pressure can be controlled with medication and lifestyle changes. \n\"These modifiable risk factors are the most powerful weapons we have in our arsenal to fight dementia,\" he said. \"It's a target that is addressable.\" \nThe study was published Oct. 4 in the journal Neurology .

What is the dosage of Buspar vs. Zoloft? Buspar dosage The usual starting adult dose is 10-15 mg daily given in 2 or 3 doses. The dose may be increased by 5 mg every 2 to 4 days until an effective dose is found. The maximum adult dose is 60 mg daily, but most patients respond to 15-30 mg daily. Although food increases the amount of buspirone that is absorbed, the importance of this effect is not clear. Buspirone can be taken with or without food, but preferably on a consistent basis. Zoloft dosage The recommended dose of sertraline is 25-200 mg once daily. Treatment of depression, OCD, panic disorder, PTSD, and social anxiety disorder is initiated at 25-50 mg once daily. Doses are increased at weekly intervals until the desired response is seen. The recommended dose for PMDD is 50-150 mg every day of the menstrual cycle or for 14 days before menstruation . Sertraline may be taken with or without food. What drugs interact with Buspar vs. Zoloft? Buspar drug interactions \nBuspirone may interact with drugs called monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate), and procarbazine ( Matulane ) which are used in psychiatric disorders. The use of buspirone with these drugs can cause increased blood pressure . A similar reaction may occur if buspirone is combined with linezolid (Zyvox), an antibiotic that is also an MAO inhibitor. The combination of buspirone and trazodone ( Desyrel ), an antidepressant, may cause abnormal liver enzymes in the blood. \nThe combination of buspirone and warfarin ( Coumadin ), a blood thinner, may accentuate the effects of warfarin and increase the risk of bleeding. Patients taking buspirone should not drink grapefruit juice, since the juice (even well after a dose of buspirone is taken) can increase the amount of buspirone in the blood, possibly leading to side effects. \nInactivation and removal of buspirone is mediated by liver enzymes. Drugs (for example, erythromycin , itraconazole [ Sporanox ], nefazodone [ Serzone ]) that inhibit these liver enzyme increase blood concentrations of buspirone, and drugs (for example, rifampin) that enhance these enzymes decrease blood concentrations of buspirone. Increased blood concentrations may increase side effects while decreased blood concentrations may reduce efficacy. Zoloft drug interactions \nAll SSRIs, including Zoloft, should not be taken with any of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) class of antidepressants, for example isocarboxazid (Marplan),", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T08:28:33.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c926ee561355000e816ae1be7c431cf72364c2ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXJy8QueI_F2U6pCJzyXavjMaN7LkWrrUlzlHesSCf46OHGQ6n.O5m6ahKypMxVh_H_APOWehjPRTOI4Rtidzg", "site_full": "www.medicinenet.com", "site": "medicinenet.com", "site_section": "http://www.medicinenet.com/rss/general/heart.xml", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "MedicineNet Heart General", "title": "Surviving Heart Attack Often Means Leaving Job Behind", "title_full": "Surviving Heart Attack Often Means Leaving Job Behind", "published": "2017-10-05T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.medicinenet.com/images/facebook/medicinenet/fb-mnet-default.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1836, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c926ee561355000e816ae1be7c431cf72364c2ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXJy8QueI_F2U6pCJzyXavjMaN7LkWrrUlzlHesSCf46OHGQ6n.O5m6ahKypMxVh_H_APOWehjPRTOI4Rtidzg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Surviving Heart Attack Often Means Leaving Job Behind", "text": "home / heart center / heart a-z list / surviving heart attack often means leaving job article Surviving Heart Attack Often Means Leaving Job Behind Want More News?

She is a graduate student at Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark. \nAn estimated 676,000 people in the United States survive heart attacks each year, according to the American Heart Association. Many survivors are of working age: The average age of heart attack is 65 for men and 72 for women, the association says. \nThe new study examined the medical and work records of over 22,000 patients in Denmark who were employed before suffering heart attacks between 1997 and 2012. \nOf those, 91 percent returned to work within a year. But within a year of going back to work, 24 percent of the patients had left their jobs. That's three times the normal rate of leaving a job, the researchers reported. It's not clear, however, whether the heart attack survivors quit their jobs, or were fired or laid off. \nPatients aged 30 to 39 and 60 to 65, and those who had heart failure , diabetes or depression , were especially likely to leave their jobs. Workers with higher incomes and more education were more likely to stay on the job, the findings showed. \nPetersen said the percentage of heart attack patients who return to work and then leave their jobs may be even higher in the United States. \n\"In Denmark, all citizens have equal access to health care and all patients receive treatment free of charge,\" she explained. \nOne U.S. expert said the findings are sobering. \n\"The study is an important reminder that recovery is often measured in months and years, not just weeks,\" said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, director of the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut. \n\"To understand the impact of a heart attack requires that we fully understand people's roles and function. We should study how best to help people fully resume their prior activities and have the choice as to whether they want to continue working,\" Krumholz explained. \nKarina Davidson, executive director of Columbia University's Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, said fatigue and an inability to perform manual labor are some of the reasons why heart attack survivors leave their jobs. \n\"Patients after a heart attack do indeed have a long road to recovery, and cardiac rehabilitation, strong family support and follow-up with their medical care are important components to ensure the best recovery possible,\" she said. \"Returning to work full-time will be realistic for some patients, but not for all.\" \nThe study was published Oct. 4 in the Journal of the American Heart Association .

Latest Healthy Kids   \nTeens who ate the least vitamin K -rich foods -- such as spinach, cabbage, iceberg lettuce and olive oil -- had triple the risk for enlargement of the heart's left pumping chamber compared to their greens-eating peers, according to the study. \nChanges in the heart's left pumping chamber are usually seen in adults with chronic high blood pressure . Hearts that become bigger are less efficient and less effective, said the study authors from the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University. \n\"Those who consumed less [vitamin K] had more risk,\" Dr. Norman Pollock, the study's corresponding author,   \nFor the study, researchers asked 766 healthy teens, aged 14 to 18, to wear activity monitors for seven days and to record what they ate. Most participants tracked their diet for at least six days. The teens also underwent an echocardiography test to examine their left ventricle . \nOnly 25 percent of the study participants had even adequate intake of vitamin K, the researchers found. And overall, about 10 percent of the teens had some level of enlargement in their left heart ventricle . \nThe study's co-first author, Mary Ellen Fain, a second-year student at the medical college, said, \"Even at that age, it seemed to make a difference in their hearts.\" \nThe findings held even after considering other possible contributing factors, such as gender, race, physical activity and blood pressure , Fain said. \nHowever, the study doesn't establish a direct causal relationship. \nVitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone health. This nutrient may also improve activity of a protein, known as matrix Gla protein, which helps prevent calcium deposits from forming within blood vessels. \nThe researchers said more studies are needed to assess the association between vitamin K intake and long-term heart health. \nThe findings were published Oct. 2 in The Journal of Nutrition   SOURCE: Augusta University, news release, Oct. 2, 2017 Next Article: Protecting Preemies From Stress   Children's Health & Parenting Newsletter  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T10:40:43.383+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05c320e81753bc5e57455a82c9d3647029a9cf17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXJy8QueI_F2U6pCJzyXavjMaN7LkWrrUlzlHesSCf46OHGQ6n.O5m6ahKypMxVh95KnRVBukmWZ183fHmyW1Q", "site_full": "www.medicinenet.com", "site": "medicinenet.com", "site_section": "http://www.medicinenet.com/rss/general/kids_health.xml", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "MedicineNet Kids Health General", "title": "Online Game Could Boost Family Fitness", "title_full": "Online Game Could Boost Family Fitness", "published": "2017-10-03T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.medicinenet.com/images/facebook/medicinenet/fb-mnet-default.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1836, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "05c320e81753bc5e57455a82c9d3647029a9cf17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXJy8QueI_F2U6pCJzyXavjMaN7LkWrrUlzlHesSCf46OHGQ6n.O5m6ahKypMxVh95KnRVBukmWZ183fHmyW1Q", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Online Game Could Boost Family Fitness", "text": "  online game could boost family fitness article Online Game Could Boost Family Fitness By Randy Dotinga HealthDay Reporter \nMONDAY, Oct. 2, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- The family that plays an online game together may get more exercise together, a new study suggests.   Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nSound counterintuitive? Well, researchers have long struggled with finding ways to coax families to move more, but the online game -- where the only prize was a lowly mug -- convinced spouses, parents and kids to log more steps in their daily walking routines. \nWhile all of the participants were white, and richer and healthier than most others their age in the United States, the study authors believe the approach holds plenty of potential. \nGames are \"a promising approach to improve daily health behaviors,\" said Dr. Mitesh Patel. He is an assistant professor of medicine and health care management at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \"But the design of the game is critical to its success.\" \nMore than half of adult Americans don't get enough exercise , according to Patel. There's evidence that connections with other people can help individuals exercise more, but \"most exercise programs focus on the individual and don't harness these interactions from social networks.\" \nMeanwhile, some game-style apps have tried to coax people to exercise, Patel said, but their design tends to assume \"that people behave rationally and make decisions in line with their longer-term goals. However, we know that most people don't behave this way.\" \nFor the new study, the researchers sent step-tracking technology, such as a Fitbit, to the participants. The investigators also provided an app to family members enlisted in the study. One person in each family group was randomly chosen to be tracked each day, and the group gained points if that person met goals for steps. \n\"Everyone got five lifelines to use on days they were sick or couldn't achieve their goals for other reasons. This provided a sense of forgiveness,\" Patel said. At the end of 12 weeks, groups would receive mugs if they met certain exercise goals. There were no other prizes. \nTwo hundred people from 94 family groups took part in the study. Overall, they were significantly different than the U.S. general population: 56 percent were female and their average age was 55. The group was active overall, exercising an average of about 7,500 steps a day before the study began; Patel said the average in the United States is closer to 5,000 steps. \nAlso, all participants were white, most had household incomes over $100,000, and all were part of the Framingham Heart Study, a long-term study of health in a Massachusetts town. Few smoked or had heart disease or diabetes . \nAbout half of the participants were assigned to play the game and get messages about their step goals, while the others only received the messages (the \"control\" group). \nDuring the first 12 weeks, those who played the game boosted their average daily step count by an adjusted 1,661 steps, compared to 636 in the control group. Most continued for another 12 weeks, and there was still a gap between the two groups in regard to how much they boosted their daily average step counts compared to baseline: 1,385 extra steps in the game group versus 798 in the control group. \nThe researchers didn't measure whether the health of those in the two groups improved. They also didn't analyze the cost of the program. \nMore research is under way and will be launched soon, Patel said. One goal is to better understand whether games could be used to help people lose weight and improve their health when they have conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes , Patel added. \nIn an accompanying commentary, researcher Dr. Ichiro Kawachi writes that \"much remains to be learned about 'gamification'\" -- a term that refers to the use of games to encourage actions like buying a product or exercising more. \nIn virtual reality (including games like Pokemon Go that combine real and imaginary images), \"the line between entertainment and public health is becoming progressively blurred,\" wrote Kawachi. He is chair of the department of social and behavioral sciences at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. \nAccording to Kawachi, there's an opportunity to use technology to make improving health an \"engaging, fulfilling and fun activity.\" \nThe study was published online Oct. 2 in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine .

Latest Healthy Kids News   \nThe agency warned parents and caregivers that these products, also known as \"nests\" or \"anti-roll\" supports, can prevent babies from breathing . \nThe two most common sleep positioners include two raised pillows or \"bolsters\" attached to a mat. Babies younger than 6 months old are placed on the mat between the pillows to keep them in a specific position while they are sleeping. \nBut putting babies to sleep on or near soft objects, such as positioners, toys, pillows and loose bedding, increases the risk for accidental suffocation and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome ( SIDS ), the American Academy of Pediatrics says. \nSome babies have been found in dangerous positions next to a positioner they had been placed in for sleeping. Federal officials also reported that infants have died after being placed in one of these products. In most cases, the infants got out of position, rolled onto their stomachs and suffocated, the FDA explained. \nThe agency urged parents and caregivers to always put babies on their back for naps and when they go to sleep at night. \nBabies should never sleep with a positioner, pillow, blanket, sheets, a comforter or a quilt, the FDA advised. \nInfants' sleeping surfaces should be bare and free of any loose items. Appropriate clothing keeps babies warm enough while they are sleeping. \nThe FDA regulates baby products that claim to cure, treat, prevent or reduce a disease or condition. Some sleep positioner companies claim that their products prevent SIDS. But the FDA noted it has never cleared an infant sleep positioner that promises to prevent or reduce the risk of SIDS since there is no scientific evidence to back up this claim. \nSome companies market their products as helpful for easing gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ), a condition that causes stomach acids to back up into the esophagus . Others suggest their positioners help prevent flat head syndrome (plagiocephaly), a deformation caused by pressure on one part of the skull. \nBut while some products were previously approved for GERD and flat head syndrome, the FDA asked these companies to stop marketing these items since the risks associated with their use outweighed any possible benefits. \nEvery year about 4,000 infants die unexpectedly while sleeping due to suffocation, SIDS or another unknown cause, according to the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. \nThe FDA urged parents and caregivers to talk to their child's doctor if they have questions about putting babies to sleep safely. \n-- Mary Elizabeth Dallas   SOURCE: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, news release, Oct. 3, 2017 Next Article: Too Little of This Vitamin Could Harm Young Hearts   Children's Health & Parenting  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T10:41:01.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f51950cded1c7636694a6c9a518681ff57b4600f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXJy8QueI_F2U6pCJzyXavjMaN7LkWrrUlzlHesSCf46OHGQ6n.O5m6ahKypMxVh81eOCcoLNxBA1QgdChqJ.w", "site_full": "www.medicinenet.com", "site": "medicinenet.com", "site_section": "http://www.medicinenet.com/rss/general/diet_and_weight_management.xml", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "MedicineNet Diet and Weight Management General", "title": "Working Night Shifts May Widen Your Waistline", "title_full": "Working Night Shifts May Widen Your Waistline", "published": "2017-10-05T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.medicinenet.com/images/facebook/medicinenet/fb-mnet-default.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1836, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f51950cded1c7636694a6c9a518681ff57b4600f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXJy8QueI_F2U6pCJzyXavjMaN7LkWrrUlzlHesSCf46OHGQ6n.O5m6ahKypMxVh81eOCcoLNxBA1QgdChqJ.w", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Working Night Shifts May Widen Your Waistline", "text": "home / health & living center / diet & weight management a-z list / working night shifts may widen your waistline article Working Night Shifts May Widen Your Waistline By Alan Mozes HealthDay Reporter \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4,   Workers who regularly pull overnight shifts may be more prone to pack on the pounds, a new analysis suggests. Latest Diet & Weight Management News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nThe finding involved an in-depth look at 28 studies conducted between 1999 and 2016. \nAll the investigations explored the health impact of shift work, in which employees are regularly asked to either alternate between daytime and overnight schedules or to exclusively work overnight hours. \nAn estimated 700 million men and women around the world now follow that work pattern, representing about 20 percent of the global workforce, the researchers said. \nAnd while the numbers varied by study, the new analysis determined that, on average, routinely working a night shift seems to boost the risk for becoming obese or overweight by 29 percent. \nAlthough the review could not prove cause-and-effect, nutrition experts expressed little surprise at the finding. \nConnie Diekman, director of university nutrition at Washington University in St. Louis, suggested that sleep disruption is without question the main culprit. \n\"As studies have demonstrated, and this study supports, the human body is programmed to sleep when it is dark, allowing hormones that impact hunger and satiety to reset for the next day,\" she explained. \n\"When people are awake when they should be sleeping, the hormones related to hunger and satiety appear to be thrown off, resulting in changes in eating, changes in metabolism and a tendency to eat more than we need,\" Diekman said. \nThat point was seconded by Penny Kris-Etherton, a professor of nutrition at Penn State University. \n\"Sleep deprivation is a major stressor that should be avoided as much as possible,\" she said, noting that by working night shifts, people are inevitably working against their natural biological clocks. \nNeither Diekman nor Kris-Etherton were part of the current review team, which was led by M. Sun of the JC School of Public Health and Primary Care at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. \nThe investigators reported their findings in the Oct. 4 issue of Obesity Reviews . \nAccording to the International Labour Organization, any schedule that requires working between midnight and 5 a.m. is considered night-shift work. \nThe review revealed that workers who are permanently assigned to overnight work are particularly prone to accumulating excess weight, compared with those who alternate between day and night shifts. \nThe report also suggested that the longer a worker engages in regular night-shift work, the higher the risk for gaining weight. In addition, abdominal obesity risk was specifically found to shoot up by 35 percent among those who routinely work nights. \nThat particular finding could ring public health alarm bells, given that abdominal fat has long been associated with metabolic syndrome . The syndrome includes high blood pressure , high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels , and it drives up the risk for developing heart disease , diabetes and stroke . \nWhat's more, less than 3 percent of these workers adapted their sleep schedules to accommodate night-time work, suggesting that many were likely not getting a sufficient amount of sleep on a routine basis. \n\"This [has] an impact on the circadian rhythm ,\" said Diekman, referring to everyone's natural 24-hour internal sleep clock. \nAccording to the National Sleep Foundation, wakefulness naturally hits its lowest point between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., at the center of a standard night shift. \nNight shifts also challenge a worker's ability to access good food and exercise regularly, noted Kris-Etherton. \nOne solution, she said, is to \"bring healthy foods and snacks to the workplace to eat.\" \nAdvanced planning is key, agreed Diekman. \"Preparing dishes ahead of time is an easy way to have better options,\" she said. \n\"If your workplace does not offer good options or if you only have vending machines, think about better food choices that you could carry, and then how those choices can pair with what is available onsite,\" Diekman suggested. \n\"And, of course, remember that if you can get more movement into your workday it will help you with energy levels and possibly weight,\" Diekman added.

People with diabetes don't have enough insulin to cover their bodies' basic needs for the hormone. \nThe researchers thought by mapping the genetic makeup of insulinoma tumors, they might come up with the genomic recipe for regenerating the beta cells that produce insulin. And if they could use that \"recipe\" to make a drug that would trigger the body to make insulin, they could treat -- or possibly even reverse -- diabetes . \nThe study's senior author, Dr. Andrew Stewart, said the researchers have mapped approximately 90 insulinoma tumors at this point, but only 38 were included in the current study. \n\"We have an actual wiring diagram in molecular terms for beta cell replication, and there are different mutation patterns that lead to beta cell regeneration. We've found about 30 different pathways,\" said Stewart. \nHe directs the Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \nStewart said it wasn't a complete surprise to see that there were multiple pathways, instead of just one or two. For example, he said, there isn't just one set of molecules that makes growth plates during childhood. \n\"We found many additional pathways... This is a data mine for diabetes researchers,\" he said. \nInsulin, which is made in the pancreas, is used to usher the sugar from foods into the body's cells to be used as energy. \nPeople with type 2 diabetes are resistant to the effects of insulin, and may not make enough insulin. About 29 million people in the United States have this type of diabetes, which is associated with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. \nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to mistakenly destroy insulin-producing beta cells. People with type 1 diabetes must replace that lost insulin through injections or an insulin pump . Approximately 1.25 million Americans have type 1 diabetes , according to the American Diabetes Association. \nWith the information from this new study, the researchers hope to find or develop drugs that could work on one of those newly identified pathways. But it's important that the pathway doesn't have any other serious effects. \nStewart and his colleagues published a study in Nature Medicine in 2015 showing how the drug harmine could prompt beta cell regeneration in the lab and in mice. The pathway linked to harmine was one of the ones found in the current paper, too. \nBut \"harmine is a hallucinogen ,\" Stewart said. \nSo, if taken as a pill or given as a shot, it would affect the whole body and produce unwanted side effects. \n\"We still need a way to deliver it specifically to the beta cells,\" said Stewart. \nThere's also a concern that a drug like an insulinoma could cause the body to produce too much insulin, leading to potentially dangerous side effects. \nAndrew Rakeman is assistant vice president of research for JDRF -- formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. \n\"You don't want to replicate the lack of control of an insulinoma. The question is can we find ways to switch these pathways on and then switch them off?\" said Rakeman, who wasn't involved in the new study. \nHe also pointed out that it's important that any drug just targets the beta cells and doesn't encourage cell growth in other areas. \nStewart said a therapy developed from these pathways would likely be for people with type 2 diabetes first. People with type 1 diabetes have the added issue of the autoimmune attack, which could destroy any newly made cells. \nFor people with type 1 diabetes, some sort of immune system suppression might be necessary, Stewart said. Rakeman said it's possible repeated treatments might keep enough beta cells alive to be effective, though that remains to be seen. \nFor now, Stewart and Rakeman said these findings are hopeful. \n\"Amazing things are happening in the world of beta cell regeneration,\" Stewart said. \nRakeman agreed. \"We understand much more about what's happening with beta cells. We can take those lessons and build out therapeutic targets,\" he said. \nThe study was published Oct. 3 in the journal Nature Communications . Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay. All rights reserved.

Vaccines teach the immune system to produce its own antibody protection against a pathogen. \nInstead, this approach belongs to a new wave of immunology called \"passive immunotherapy,\" in which people are injected with pre-made antibodies that provide immediate and direct protection against viruses . \n\"What we're doing here is simply short-cutting the vaccination,\" Watkins said. \nUnfortunately, these antibodies have a short half-life, living only weeks or months in the bloodstream before they wear out. People must receive regular injections of the antibodies to maintain their immunity, since their own immune system never learns how to make the antibodies. \nThe same approach has shown promise in protecting against HIV infection. Two research teams successfully used cloned antibodies to shield monkeys from HIV , according to findings published in the journals Science and Science Translational Medicine in September. \nAntibodies work against Zika and other viruses by blocking their entry into human cells, Watkins said. \n\"These proteins will stick to a virus and prevent it from entering into the cells of that person,\" he said. \"That's critical because a virus can't make copies of itself outside of a cell. It needs to get inside a cell to replicate and spread.\" \nFor this experiment, Watkins and his colleagues collected 91 different antibodies produced by a Zika-infected patient from Colombia. \nThey then selected three specific antibodies that seemed most potent against Zika, and cloned enough copies of the antibodies for use in injections. \nResearchers injected the antibody trio into four lab monkeys, and a day later they were exposed to the Zika virus . None of the monkeys developed Zika infection during three weeks of observation, but four control monkeys exposed to the same strain of Zika did become infected with the virus. \nFurther testing in pregnant primates will be needed before human testing can occur, the researchers said. And animal findings frequently don't produce similar results in humans. \nHowever, Watkins said he is \"cautiously optimistic\" that the antibody cocktail will be safe to both mother and unborn child. \n\"Mothers are full of antibodies already, and we know antibodies cross the placenta to provide protection to the fetus,\" Watkins said. \nThe researchers are currently seeking funding to grow large quantities of the antibodies for further primate and human testing, he said. \nThis approach to immune protection is easier than developing a vaccine and potentially more effective, since individual responses to vaccination can vary, Watkins said. \n\"I think the future of much of medicine will be administration of antibodies for infectious diseases,\" Watkins said. \nThe study appears Oct. 4 in the journal Science Translational Medicine .

Latest Cancer News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nResearchers from the Yale Cancer Center say they identified the molecular mechanism that enables the mutation to cause the BRCA1 gene to lose its DNA repair and tumor -fighting power. \n\"There have been about 14,000 papers written about BRCA1, and you would think we already know everything about the gene, but we don't,\" said study senior author Patrick Sung, a professor of molecular biophysics and biochemistry and of therapeutic radiology. \nThe investigators showed that the interaction of BRCA1 with the BARD1 gene is necessary for DNA repair. They said their findings could lead to better drugs to treat breast and ovarian cancers and help identify women at high risk for these diseases. \n\"Defining the mechanism of the BRCA-dependent DNA repair pathway will help scientists design drugs to kill cancer cells more efficiently,\" Sung said in a Yale news release. \nScientists realized women could inherit their risk for breast cancer once they discovered the role of the BRCA1 gene in DNA repair and tumor suppression, the study authors explained. At first, it was believed that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations might account for up to 8 percent of breast and ovarian cancers. \nThe researchers noted the risk is likely much higher because in many cancers there is no evidence of mutation but the expression of the BRCA genes is silenced. \n\"Understanding this mechanism will provide the predictive power for doctors trying to establish a patient's personal risk of developing cancer ,\" Sung said. \n-- Mary Elizabeth Dallas Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Latest Cancer News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nFollicular lymphoma is one type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a group of cancers that arise in white blood cells. \nThe new study found that a drug called obinutuzumab (Gazyva) typically kept the cancer under control longer, versus the standard drug rituximab ( Rituxan ). \nAfter three years, about 80 percent of obinutuzumab patients were showing no signs of cancer progression or relapse. That compared with roughly 73 percent of rituximab patients, according to the report. \nCancer experts said the results, published in the Oct. 5 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine , are a positive step forward. \nBut they do not necessarily mean obinutuzumab is the better choice for all patients, according to Dr. James Armitage, an oncologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, in Omaha. \n\"Obinutuzumab had a modest advantage in progression-free survival,\" said Armitage, who co-wrote an editorial published with the study. \nBut the drug also tended to cause more side effects than rituximab, he pointed out. And no one knows yet whether it will ultimately help patients live longer. \nArmitage said \"reasonable people\" could disagree over which drug option is better. \nIn the United States, more than 72,000 people are diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma each year, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). Follicular lymphoma accounts for roughly 20 percent of those cases. \nFollicular lymphoma is usually slow-growing and responds well to treatment, according to the ACS -- but most patients do eventually relapse. \nHowever, when rituximab became widely available back in 2000, it changed patients' prognosis, according to Armitage. \nThe drug is a lab-engineered antibody that latches onto a particular protein on B cells -- the type of white blood cell affected in follicular lymphoma. It's often used along with chemotherapy to get patients into remission; afterward, it can be used alone, as a longer-term \"maintenance\" therapy to keep the cancer at bay. \nWith that maintenance therapy, research has found, over 87 percent of patients are still alive after six years. \nStill, there's always a hope to do better, Armitage said. \nSo the new trial tested obinutuzumab as an alternative first-line therapy. Like rituximab, the drug is an antibody. It's already approved in the United States to treat follicular lymphoma patients who relapse or do not respond to rituximab. \nFor the study, researchers recruited 1,200 patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphoma and randomly assigned them to one of two groups. One received chemotherapy plus rituximab, and if they responded, that was followed by rituximab maintenance for up to two years. \nPatients in the other group underwent a similar regimen, but with obinutuzumab. \nMost patients -- around 88 percent -- responded to the treatment, regardless of which antibody therapy was used. But obinutuzumab patients were more likely to be progression-free after three years, the study found. \nDr. Robert Marcus, the lead researcher on the study, said he thinks the results will have an immediate impact on \"real-world\" treatment. \nBased on the data so far, it's \"projected\" that patients on obinutuzumab could typically go more than nine years before seeing a progression, according to Marcus, of King's College Hospital, in London, England. \nThere are downsides, though. Both antibody drugs are given by infusion every couple of months. But obinutuzumab is more likely to cause serious infusion-related problems, including severe allergic reactions. \nThat happened to 59 percent of obinutuzumab patients in the trial, compared to 49 percent of rituximab patients. \nPlus, six patients on the drug developed a second blood cancer, while no patient on rituximab did, according to the report. \n\"That's a concerning finding that should be investigated further,\" Armitage said. \nWhen rituximab came on the scene, he noted, it made such a difference in patients' outlook, \"it changed everything.\" \nWith the newer antibody, though, the possible impact on treatment is tougher to predict, Armitage said. \n\"Incremental improvements are important, but it's less clear what to do with them,\" he explained. \nThe trial was funded by the pharmaceutical company Roche, which markets obinutuzumab under the brand name Gazyva. In August, the company announced it had submitted an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to have the drug approved as a first-line therapy for follicular lymphoma.

Those differences may depend on specific local characteristics like public transportation, he and his colleagues reported. \nTo see whether the on-demand car services affect drunk-driving collision rates, Morrison's team looked at car crash histories and Uber availability between 2013 and 2016 in four cities: Reno and Las Vegas, Nev.; Portland, Ore.; and San Antonio, Texas. Uber is the largest ride-sharing business. \n\"Alcohol-involved crashes were reduced by about 60 percent in Portland, Oregon, but not at all in Reno, Nevada,\" said Morrison, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Injury Science Center. \"The surprise was that even where there is a reduction in alcohol-involved crashes, we did not detect any reduction in crashes overall.\" \nWhy that's so isn't clear, Morrison said. \"There could be something offsetting the reduction in alcohol-involved crashes, like an increase in non-alcohol involved crashes. It could also be that the decrease in alcohol-involved crashes is too small to detect within the overall crash rate,\" he said. \nCar crashes are the top cause of fatalities among Americans aged 13 to 25. In 2015 alone, about 6.3 million car crashes took place on American roadways, killing more than 35,000 and injuring more than 2.4 million. Roughly one-third of deadly crashes were fueled by alcohol, the researchers said in background notes. \nThe cities chosen for the new study had similar ride-sharing histories. Uber service was launched, discontinued and eventually reinstated. \nUber resumption was not linked to a drop in the number of serious crashes. Nor was it linked to a drop in total crash-related injuries, the researchers said. \nBut state department of transportation numbers revealed that the number of alcohol-related crashes did drop with resumption of Uber services in Portland and San Antonio. That number did not fall in Reno. \nWhy? \n\"The differences could be due to a wide range of different factors,\" said Morrison. \"One likely explanation is that local populations use public and private transport differently from city to city, and probably also use ride-sharing services differently from city to city.\" \nFor example, Portland has many more public transport options than Reno. People might choose to use these alternatives to private vehicles after having one too many, he said. \nThe upshot is \"the effects of ride-sharing on crashes will differ from city to city, so cities should consider their own local transport conditions when assessing the likely costs or benefits to public health of ride-sharing,\" Morrison said. \n\"It's not enough to look at average effects from other locations and assume they will be repeated within a given city,\" he added. \nStill, accident-prevention experts applauded the potential protective benefits of ride-sharing. \nAmy George, a senior vice president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), said ride-sharing makes it \"easier than ever to make the safe choice to not drink and drive.\" \nMADD supports \"Uber driver partners as the ultimate designated drivers, and how rideshare apps have removed the excuse to drive drunk,\" she added. \nRuss Martin is director of government relations with the Governors Highway Safety Association in Washington, D.C. It's \"not surprising that researchers are having trouble drawing conclusive results on the safety impact given the complexity of studying travel behavior and all of the difficult variables to account for,\" he said. \nAt the same time, Martin said, \"it is not surprising that ride-sharing services are making a difference, as we know that consumers are using these services as the designated driver.\" \nRide-sharing, Martin added, \"can provide a great alternative to drunk driving, and communities looking to leverage this idea should keep all of these various dynamics in mind when designing programs.\" \nThe findings were published Oct. 4 in the American Journal of Epidemiology .

Doctor's response \nMale breast cancer is a rare medical condition, accounting for only about 1% of all breast cancers . Statistics from the American Cancer Society suggest that yearly, about 2,600 new cases of breast cancer in men are diagnosed and that breast cancer causes approximately 440 deaths in men (in comparison, almost 40,000 women die of breast cancer each year). Breast cancer is 100 times more common in women than in men. Most cases of male breast cancer are detected in men between the ages of 60 and 70, although the condition can develop in men of any age. A man's lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is about 1/10 of 1%, or one in 1,000. Breast cancer incidence rates in men have remained fairly stable over the past 30 years. What are causes and risk factors of male breast cancer? \nAs with cancer of the female breast, the cause of cancer of the male breast has not been fully characterized, but both environmental influences and genetic ( inherited ) factors likely play a role in its development. The following health risk factors for the development of male breast cancer have been identified. Radiation exposure \nExposure to ionizing radiation has been associated with an increased risk of developing male breast cancer. Men who have previously undergone radiation therapy to treat malignancies in the chest area (for example, Hodgkin's lymphoma ) have an increased risk for the development of breast cancer. Hyperestrogenism (high levels of estrogen) \nMen normally produce small amounts of the female hormone estrogen, but certain conditions result in abnormally high levels of estrogen in men. The term gynecomastia means that the male breasts are abnormally enlarged in response to elevated levels of estrogen. High levels of estrogens also can increase the risk for development of male breast cancer. The majority of breast cancers in men are estrogen receptor-positive (meaning that they have proteins on the surface of the cells that can receive and transport estrogen through the cell wall and into the interior of the cell). Two medical conditions in which men have abnormally high levels of estrogen that are commonly associated with breast enlargement are Klinefelter's syndrome and cirrhosis of the liver . Obesity is also associated with elevated estrogen levels and breast enlargement in men. Certain medications can cause gynecomastia as a side effect when taken for long periods. These include several types of medicine used to treat high blood pressure , medicines to reduce stomach acid, valium , finasteride , medicines to treat prostate cancer , and others. Check the side effects of the medicines you take if you think you may be developing male breast tissue enlargement (gynecomastia). Klinefelter's syndrome \nKlinefelter's syndrome is an inherited health condition affecting about one in 1,000 men. A normal man has two sex chromosomes (X and Y). He inherited the female X chromosome from his mother and the male Y chromosome from his father. Men with Klinefelter's syndrome have inherited an extra female X chromosome, resulting in an abnormal sex chromosome makeup of XXY rather than the normal male XY. Affected Klinefelter's patients produce high levels of estrogen and develop enlarged breasts, sparse facial and body hair, small testes, and the inability to produce sperm. Some studies have shown an increase in the risk of developing breast cancer in men with this condition. Their risk for development of breast cancer is markedly increased, up to 50 times that of normal men. Cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver \nCirrhosis can result from chronic alcohol abuse , chronic viral hepatitis , or rare genetic conditions that result in accumulation of toxic substances within the liver. The liver produces important binding proteins that affect the transport and delivery of male and female hormones via the bloodstream. With cirrhosis, liver function is compromised, and the levels of free and protein-bound male and female hormones in the bloodstream are altered. Men with cirrhosis of the liver have higher blood levels of estrogen and have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Familial predisposition \nEpidemiologic studies have shown that men who have several female relatives with breast cancer also have an increased risk for development of the disease. In particular, men who have inherited mutations in the breast cancer-associated BRCA-2 gene have an increased risk for developing breast cancer, with a lifetime risk of about 6 in 100 for development of breast cancer. BRCA-2 is a gene on chromosome 13 that normally functions in suppression of cell growth. Mutations in this gene lead to an increased risk for development of breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers . A portion of breast cancers in men are thought to be attributable to BRCA-2 mutation. Mutations in the BRCA-1 gene, which has been associated with inherited breast cancers in women, increase the risk for male breast cancer to a lesser degree than mutations in BRCA-2 (lifetime risk of 1 in 100). \nOther genetic mutations have also been associated with an increase in risk for breast cancer in men, including mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene (Cowden\u2019s syndrome), TP53 mutations (Li-Fraumeni syndrome), PALB2 mutations, and mutations associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome). Finasteride use \nFinasteride (Propecia, Proscar ), a drug that has been used to treat baldness , as well as benign prostatic hyperplasia ( prostate enlargement ) and to prevent prostate cancer , may be associated with an increased risk for male breast cancer. During clinical trials for the drug, no increased risk was shown. However, over 50 cases of male breast cancer have been reported worldwide in men taking the drug. Further studies are needed to clarify whether a causal relationship between the drug and the disease actually exists. \nTo learn more, read our full medical article about male breast cancer signs, symptoms, treatment, and prognosis.

How much breast cancer is genetic? Doctor's response \nBreast cancer cells, like all cancers , initially develop because of defects in the genetic material deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of a single cell. The human body is composed of trillions of cells. Inside the inner core (nucleus) of each cell is our DNA, located on chromosomes. Every human cell has two sets of 23 chromosomes. Each set is inherited from one parent. DNA exists as long, spiraled strands on these chromosomes. Different segments along the DNA strands contain information for various genes. Genes are blueprints that provide genetic instructions for the growth, development, and behavior of every cell. Most genes carry instructions for the types and the amount of proteins, enzymes, and other substances produced by the cells. Genes also govern the sizes and the shapes of the organs by controlling the rate of division of the cells within these organs. (During cell division, a cell makes a duplicate copy of its chromosomes and then divides into two cells.) Some genes restrict cell division and limit tissue growth. \nDefects on the DNA strands can lead to gene coding errors, which in turn can cause diseases. When genes that normally restrict cell growth and divisions are absent or defective, the affected cells can divide and multiply without restraint. The cells that divide and multiply without restraint enlarge (forming a tumor) and can also invade adjacent tissues and organs. Sometimes these cells can further break away and migrate to distant parts of the body in a process called metastasis . The ability to multiply without restraint, the tendency to invade other organs, and the ability to metastasize to other parts of the body are the key characteristics of cancers -- characteristics that are due to DNA defects. \nThe cancer -causing DNA defects can be acquired at birth (inherited) or may develop during adult life. The inherited DNA defects are present in every cell of the body. On the other hand, DNA defects that develop during adult life are confined to the descendants (products of cell divisions) of the single affected cell. Generally, inherited DNA defects have a greater tendency to cause cancers and cancers that occur earlier in life than DNA defects that develop during adult life. \nResearch has shown that 5% to 10% of breast cancers are associated with mutations (defects) in two genes known as breast cancer -associated (BRCA) genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2 . These genes function to prevent abnormal cell growth that could lead to cancer. Every cell in the body has two BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, one inherited from each parent. A woman who has received one defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene from one parent and a healthy gene from the other is called a carrier of the defective BRCA gene. Even though only one healthy BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene is needed to help prevent cancerous growth of cells, the one remaining healthy BRCA gene is vulnerable to damage during adult life by environmental factors such as toxins, radiation , and other chemicals such as free radicals. Therefore, women bearing a defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene are at an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers. Women carrying defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes also tend to develop these cancers earlier in life. \nOther rare genetic mutations are also associated with an increased risk for the development of breast cancer, including mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53, the PTEN gene, and the ATM ( ataxia-telangiectasia mutation) gene. \nSince inherited DNA defects account for only 5% to 10% of breast cancers, the majority of breast cancers are due to DNA damage that develops during adult life. Environmental factors that can cause DNA damage include free radicals, chemicals, radiation, and certain toxins. But even among individuals without inherited cancer-causing DNA defects, their vulnerability to DNA damage, their ability to repair DNA damage, and their ability to destroy cells with DNA damage, are likely to be genetically inherited. This is probably why the risk of cancer is higher among first-degree relatives of breast cancer patients, even among families that do not carry the defective BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor-suppressing genes. \nSome of the errors in the normal control mechanisms allow the accumulation of additional errors in other parts of the system. These errors may lead to gene silencing of critical control genes or the over activity of other growth-stimulating genes by activation of promoter sites adjacent to these otherwise normal genes. \nOther substances such as estrogen (a female hormone) and certain fatty acids may also increase the risk of breast cancer by stimulating the growth and division of cells of the breast tissue. \nFor more information, read our full medical article about breast cancer symptoms , signs, treatment, and prognosis.

Doctor's response \nSome of the breast cancer risk factors can be modified (such as alcohol use) while others cannot be influenced (such as age). It is important to discuss these risks with a health-care provider anytime new therapies are started (for example, postmenopausal hormone therapy ). \nSeveral risk factors are inconclusive (such as deodorants), while in other areas, the risk is being even more clearly defined (such as alcohol use). \nThe following are risk factors for breast cancer : Age: The chances of breast cancer increase as one gets older. Family history: The risk of breast cancer is higher among women who have relatives with the disease. Having a close relative with the disease (sister, mother, daughter) doubles a woman's risk. Personal history: Having been diagnosed with breast cancer in one breast increases the risk of cancer in the other breast or the chance of an additional cancer in the original breast. Women diagnosed with certain benign breast conditions have an increased risk of breast cancer. These include atypical hyperplasia, a condition in which there is abnormal proliferation of breast cells but no cancer has developed. Menstruation : Women who started their menstrual cycle at a younger age (before 12) or went through menopause later (after 55) have a slightly increased risk. Breast tissue: Women with dense breast tissue (as documented by mammogram ) have a higher risk of breast cancer. Race: White women have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, but African-American women tend to have more aggressive tumors when they do develop breast cancer. Exposure to previous chest radiation or use of diethylstilbestrol increases the risk of breast cancer. Having no children or the first child after age 30 increases the risk of breast cancer. Breastfeeding for one and a half to two years might slightly lower the risk of breast cancer. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of breast cancer both in pre- and postmenopausal women but at different rates. Use of oral contraceptives in the last 10 years increases the risk of breast cancer slightly. Using combined hormone therapy after menopause increases the risk of breast cancer. Alcohol use increases the risk of breast cancer, and this seems to be proportional to the amount of alcohol used. A recent study reviewing the research on alcohol use and breast cancer concluded that all levels of alcohol use are associated with an increased risk for breast cancer. This includes even light drinking. Exercise seems to lower the risk of breast cancer. Genetic risk factors: The most common causes are mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (breast cancer and ovarian cancer genes). Inheriting a mutated gene from a parent means that one has a significantly higher risk of developing breast cancer. What are the statistics on male breast cancer? \nBreast cancer is rare in men (approximately 2,400 new cases diagnosed per year in the U.S.) but typically has a significantly worse outcome. This is partially related to the often late diagnosis of male breast cancer , when the cancer has already spread. \nSymptoms are similar to the symptoms in women, with the most common symptom being a lump or change in skin of the breast tissue or nipple discharge . Although it can occur at any age, male breast cancer usually occurs in men over 60 years of age. \nFor more information, read our full medical article on breast cancer signs, symptoms, treatment, and prognosis.

I'm trying to figure out what I should expect going forward. How long can breast cancer patients live? Doctor's response \nSurvival rates are a way for health care professionals to discuss the prognosis and outlook of a cancer diagnosis with their patients. The number most frequently discussed is five-year survival. It is the percentage of patients who live at least five years after they are diagnosed with cancer . Many of these patients live much longer, and some patients die earlier from causes other than breast cancer . With a constant change in therapies, these numbers also change. The current five-year survival statistic is based on patients who were diagnosed at least five years ago and may have received different therapies than are available today. As with all statistics, although the numbers define outcomes for the group, any individual's outcome has the potential for a wide range of variation. \nAll of this needs to be taken into consideration when interpreting these numbers for oneself. \nBelow are the statistics from the National Cancer Institute's SEER database.

She completed residency training in Anatomic Pathology at Georgetown University followed by subspecialty fellowship training in molecular diagnostics and experimental pathology. \nHow do melanomas form? Doctor's response \nA changing skin spot may be a problem, but not every change means cancer . A mole may appear and then get bigger or become raised but still be only a mole. It is normal for many moles to start flat and dark, become raised and dark, and then later lose much of their color. This process takes many years. \nMost public-health information about melanoma stresses the so-called ABCDE s: A symmetry: One half of the mole is different from the other half. B order irregularity: The spot has borders which are not smooth and regular but uneven or notched. C olor: The spot has several colors in an irregular pattern or is a very different color than the rest of one's moles . D iameter: The spot is larger than the size of a pencil eraser (6 mm). E volving: The mole is changing in size, shape, color, or overall texture. This may also include new bleeding. \nThese guidelines are somewhat helpful, but the problem is that many normal moles and other benign lesions of the skin are not completely symmetrical in their shape or color. This means that many spots, which seem to have one or more of the ABCDEs, are in fact just ordinary moles and not melanomas. Additionally, some melanomas do not fit this description but may still be spotted by a primary-care physician or dermatologist. Not all melanomas have color or are raised on the skin. Amelanotic melanomas have little or no color to the naked eye and may be confused with traumatized benign nevi or basal cell carcinoma . Desmoplastic melanoma may appear to be a thickened area of skin like a scar . These are treated the same way as more typical melanomas but, in the latter case, may be more difficult to determine the exact margins of the tumor . \nAs a rule, melanoma is not painful unless traumatized. They sometimes itch , but this has no diagnostic or prognostic importance. \nThe more rapid and dramatic the skin change, the less serious the problem. \nWhen changes such as pain , swelling, or even bleeding come on rapidly, within a day or two, they are likely to be caused by minor trauma , often a kind one doesn't remember (like scratching the spot while sleeping). If a spot changes rapidly and then goes back to the way it was within a couple of weeks, or falls off altogether, it is not likely to represent anything serious. Nevertheless, this would be a good time to say once again: Nobody can diagnose him- or herself. If one sees a spot that looks as though it is new or changing, show it to a doctor. If one see a spot that doesn't look like one's other spots, it should be evaluated. How can people estimate their level of risk for melanoma? \nIndividual sunburns do raise one's risk of melanoma. However, slow daily sun exposure, even without burning, may also substantially raise someone's risk of skin cancer . \nFactors that raise one's risk for melanoma include the following: Caucasian (white) ancestry Fair skin, light hair, and light-colored eyes A history of intense, intermittent sun exposure, especially in childhood Many (more than 100) moles Large, irregular, or \"funny looking\" moles Close blood relatives -- parents, siblings, and children -- with melanoma \nThe presence of close (first-degree) family with melanoma is a high risk factor, although looking at all cases of melanoma, only 10% of cases run in families. \nHaving a history of other sun-induced skin cancers , such as the much more common basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas, indirectly raises one's risk of melanoma because they are markers of long-term sun exposure. The basic cell type is different, however, and a basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma cannot \"turn into melanoma\" or vice versa. \nThe best way to know one's risk level is to have a dermatologist perform a full body examination. That way one will find out whether the spots one has are moles and, if so, whether they are abnormal in the medical sense. \nThe medical term for such moles is atypical . This is a somewhat confusing term, because among other things the criteria for defining it are not clear, and it's not certain that an atypical mole is necessarily precancerous . Patients who have lots of \" atypical moles \" (more than 24) do have a higher risk for developing melanoma but not necessarily within one of their existing funny-looking moles. It may be a challenge to find the \"baby melanoma\" in the middle of a back full of large, dark, or irregular moles. If someone has such moles, a doctor will recommend regular surveillance and may recommend biopsy of the most unusual or worrisome looking moles. \nSometimes, one learns at a routine skin evaluation that one does not necessarily need annual routine checkups. In other situations, a doctor may recommend regular checks at 6-month or yearly intervals. \nFor more information, read our full medical article on melanoma symptoms, treatment, staging, and prognosis.

In this Canadian study, the researchers examined the effect of hockey, taking the pulse of fans during a game using portable monitors. \nWhen the study began, the participants also completed questionnaires about their health and their passion for the sport of hockey. Using this information, the investigators gave each person a \"fan passion score\" to help predict changes in their heart rate in response to a game. \nThe study found that, on average, the heart rate of those who watched the game live more than doubled, increasing by 110 percent. Watching a game on TV had a similar effect, increasing the heart rate of spectators by 75 percent. \nThe effects on the heart were most notable when players either attempted to score or tried to block shots on goal. Peak heart rates were also recorded during overtime, the study authors added. \nThe findings were published Oct. 5 in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology . \n\"Our analysis of elements of the hockey game associated with peak heart rates supports the notion that it is not the outcome of the game that primarily determines the intensity of the emotional stress response, but rather the excitement experienced with viewing high-stakes or high-intensity portions of the game,\" Khairy said in a journal news release. \nOverall, heart rate increased by a median of 92 percent among all the spectators, according to the report. \nThe findings should raise awareness about the potential role that sports-related stressors could play in triggering cardiac events, according to Khairy. \nThe authors of an accompanying journal editorial, Drs. David Waters and Stanley Nattel, said the research should encourage doctors to speak to their heart patients about the risks of watching sports. \n-- Mary Elizabeth Dallas Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) promotes the growth of the thyroid gland in the neck and stimulates it to produce more thyroid hormones . When there is an excessive amount of thyroid hormones, the pituitary gland stops producing TSH, reducing thyroid hormone production. This mechanism maintains a relatively constant level of thyroid hormones circulating in the blood. \nTSH is also known as thyrotropin .

He's an economist and demographer at the University of Michigan. \nAmericans born in 1960 or later must wait until age 67 to collect their full Social Security benefit. People born before that were able to collect sooner. \nSchoeni and his colleagues analyzed data collected over decades by the U.S. National Institute on Aging and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . \nThey found that a higher percentage of Americans now in their 50s rated their own health as just fair or poor, compared with what older Americans said about their own health at a similar age. \nAlso, middle-aged Americans today say they suffer from a higher rate of memory and thinking problems, versus prior generations of 50-year-olds. \nMoreover, a higher proportion of the later-born groups was limited in the ability to perform a basic daily living task, such as shopping for groceries, taking medications or getting out of bed. \nHowever, physical function (the ability to climb stairs without resting, lifting 10 pounds, etc.) did not appear to differ significantly across generations. \nThe researchers said the findings may have implications if legislators consider whether or not to shift the official age of full Social Security retirement to a later starting point. \nThe report appears in the October issue of the journal Health Affairs . \n-- Alan Mozes Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

And, that's particularly true if youngsters are otherwise healthy, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). \nThe five tests include hormone tests, endocrine tests, vitamin D screening, thyroid or insulin tests for overweight children and thyroid ultrasounds for kids with an enlarged thyroid gland or autoimmune thyroid disease , the group noted. \nDoctors and their patients should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of these procedures, advised Dr. Paul Kaplowitz in an AAP news release. He's past chairperson of the AAP Section on Endocrinology. \n\"As a pediatric endocrinologist, I've counseled many parents who are worried about their children's growth,\" Kaplowitz said. \n\"There is a wide range of what is 'normal' for child growth and development. If a child is otherwise healthy and is following their own curve, what the parents often need is reassurance that their child is fine, and not a lot of testing,\" he said. \nThe AAP compiled a list of the five commonly used procedures, urging doctors to use evidence-based strategies when ordering these tests. \nHormone tests, for example, may be unnecessary for children with pubic hair or body odor but no other physical signs of puberty, such as a growth spurt or breast development. \nScreening tests for endocrine disorders are unlikely to benefit children with a normal growth rate, according to the AAP. \nEven when these tests are performed on children who are shorter than average, they only reveal an underlying health issue in 1 percent of cases. Screening tests may be indicated, however, for children who are significantly shorter than they should be based on their parents' height, the group added. \nMeanwhile, testing for vitamin D deficiency is only appropriate for patients with disorders associated with low bone mass, such as rickets . \nFor obese children, thyroid testing should only be considered if their growth rate is abnormally low or there is another sign of a thyroid issue. \nThyroid ultrasounds may cause unnecessary worry and expenses among children and their parents. This test should be limited to children with swelling on only one side of their neck, nodules that can be felt through the skin and those with very enlarged thyroid glands. \n\"This new Choosing Wisely list will enhance discussions physicians and families have about issues in growth and development that often come up, and help craft the best treatment plans,\" Kaplowitz said. \n-- Mary Elizabeth Dallas Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

He is an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada. \nWith support from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the study team reviewed about 40 years' worth of data. \nThe data provided details on nearly 180 extremely low birth weight children who had been born between 1977 and 1982 and survived into adulthood. Their adult mental health status was compared with that of 145 adults who had been born at a normal weight. \nVan Lieshout and his colleagues noted that prior research has suggested that those born at an extremely low birth weight appear to face a higher than average risk for developing mental illness later in life. \nWhy? The team cited the specific medical burdens that come with caring for a preemie, which often exposes the child to considerable maternal anxiety , depression and familial stress . \nThe study wasn't designed to prove what might cause mental health issues in preemies as they age; it was only found associations. \nBut extra stress in their lives, said researchers, may leave preemies more vulnerable to the kind of bullying that all children and adolescents often confront while growing up. And that vulnerability may in turn raise their risk for developing mental health problems by adulthood. \n\"If we can find meaningful interventions for extremely low birth weight survivors and their parents,\" said Van Lieshout in a university news release, \"we can improve the lives of preterm survivors and potentially prevent the development of depression and anxiety in adulthood.\" \nThe study was published Oct. 3 in The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry . \n-- Alan Mozes   SOURCE: McMaster University, news release, Oct. 3, 2017 Next Article: Helping Preemies Avoid Unnecessary Antibiotics   Pregnancy & Newborns  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "van lieshout", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "-- alan mozes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan van lieshout", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. national institute of child health and human development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcmaster university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "journal of child psychology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canadian institutes of health research", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontario", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T10:44:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf3d0709c5b1aaee64be07142c624f3687e42534", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXJy8QueI_F2U6pCJzyXavjMaN7LkWrrUlzlHesSCf46OHGQ6n.O5m6ahKypMxVh9f34IyH_xGsyz9B2sjbax5", "site_full": "www.medicinenet.com", "site": "medicinenet.com", "site_section": "http://www.medicinenet.com/rss/general/kids_health.xml", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "MedicineNet Kids Health General", "title": "Helping Preemies Avoid Unnecessary Antibiotics", "title_full": "Helping Preemies Avoid Unnecessary Antibiotics", "published": "2017-10-06T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.medicinenet.com/images/facebook/medicinenet/fb-mnet-default.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1836, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bf3d0709c5b1aaee64be07142c624f3687e42534", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXJy8QueI_F2U6pCJzyXavjMaN7LkWrrUlzlHesSCf46OHGQ6n.O5m6ahKypMxVh9f34IyH_xGsyz9B2sjbax5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Helping Preemies Avoid Unnecessary Antibiotics", "text": "Want More News?

Stafford was not involved in the study. \nAt the same time, doctors are trying to reduce the use of unnecessary antibiotics, because when antibiotics are given to someone who doesn't need them, it increases the risk of developing bacteria that will resist those antibiotics in the future, Stafford explained. \nRight now, he said, close to 90 percent of extremely premature babies may be exposed to antibiotics in the hospital. \nTo see what factors might help identify babies with a low risk of infection, the researchers considered ways that babies get infections in the first place. Most infections come from the mother's uterus or the vaginal canal, according to the study. \nSo the researchers hypothesized that babies born by cesarean section, whose moms had no signs of uterine infection and who hadn't had their water break, would be at low risk of early onset sepsis. \nThe investigators then looked at a large database of more than 15,000 extremely premature infants born between 22 and 28 weeks of gestation (normal-term babies are born at 39 to 40 weeks). Almost 5,800 (37 percent) of these preemies met the low-risk criteria. \nThe rate of sepsis was 0.5 percent in the low-risk babies and 2.5 percent in the comparison group, the study showed. \n\"Knowing how to use antibiotics properly is something physicians struggle with because antibiotics have their risks and their benefits. But if you're uninfected, you're only getting the risks,\" said study author Dr. Karen Puopolo. She's an associate professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and chief of newborn care at Pennsylvania Hospital. \n\"We found a significant difference in culture-confirmed infections between the low-risk and the comparison group -- about a 70 to 80 percent lower risk,\" Puopolo said. \nWhat's more, the researchers also found that the low-risk babies had a higher risk of certain long-term complications if they were on antibiotics for five or more days. \nLow-risk babies given prolonged antibiotics were more likely to develop serious fungal infections , to develop a serious lung complication, and they even had a higher risk of dying compared to the comparison group. \n\"With all these pieces of evidence, maybe antibiotics aren't always the safest thing to do,\" Puopolo said. \nHowever, both Puopolo and Stafford said it will likely take some time before there's a significant change in practice. \nAnd both said these findings need to be confirmed in other studies. \n\"Antibiotic use is hard to avoid in this population,\" Stafford said. \"But this may get everybody to be much more critical in our thinking.\" \nPuopolo said: \"Ours is not the first dataset to show what we've always believed and what we've always done isn't working as expected. In the end, there were worse health outcomes.\" \nShe suggested that if a baby is low-risk, a doctor could try withholding antibiotics. \n\"It's a decision you can always change two hours later,\" Puopolo pointed out. \nThe study was published online Oct. 5 in Pediatrics .

Latest Lungs News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nThe concern centers on organs donated following \"circulatory death\" (DCD). That means a patient's heart, breathing and circulation stop functioning. Most donated organs come from people who are brain dead, but their circulation is continued with machines. \nOrgans donated by DCD must undergo a controlled cooling process (called \" cold ischemia\") after the organ loses its original blood supply. The organ is then re-warmed when blood supply is renewed at the time of transplant. \nThis process leads to a heightened risk for tissue damage. \nBut a team led by Dr. John Gill of the University of British Columbia and Vancouver's Providence Health Care found that by limiting the cooling process to a period of no more than 12 hours, DCD kidney donations were just as likely to survive once transplanted than those donated following brain death. \nIn a news release, Gill said that in such cases \"the outcomes are generally excellent, and that the use of these organs could probably be safely increased if cold ischemia times are limited.\" \nThe team noted that DCD kidney donations have become more and more common over the last decade or so. While they constituted about 7 percent of all kidney donations back in 2005, by 2015 they accounted for nearly 18 percent. \nThe study was published Oct. 5 in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology . \n-- Alan Mozes Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

This makes it tough for tobacco control advocates to adopt a pragmatic strategy focused on the devices, said Dr. Louis DePalo, a professor of pulmonology with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \nFDA-approved nicotine replacement products such as gum or patches are considered safe and are used alongside counseling and therapy to help people kick their addiction , DePalo said. Gum and patches also aren't as pleasurable as using an e-cigarette, and that enjoyment might make it more difficult for someone to wean themselves off e-cigarettes. \n\"E-cigarettes in an unregulated environment just don't offer you the exit strategy of being part of a comprehensive smoking cessation strategy,\" said DePalo, who had no role in the new study. \nFor the study, Levy and his colleagues crafted optimistic and pessimistic scenarios under which smokers start adopting e-cigarettes, and then projected out how many lives would be saved and extended under those scenarios. \nThe optimistic scenario assumes that: Cigarette smoking would decline to 5 percent of the U.S. population as e-cigarettes become the more popular option, down from the current 16 percent. New smokers would take up e-cigarettes rather than tobacco. People would quit e-cigarettes at about the same rate they quit tobacco. E-cigarettes carry 5 percent of the health risk of tobacco cigarettes. \nThe pessimistic scenario paints a somewhat darker picture, as expected. It assumes that: About 10 percent of Americans would still smoke tobacco; more never-smokers would take up e-cigarettes. Vapers would quit at half the rate of smokers. E-cigarettes carry about 40 percent of the risk of smoking . \nThis less-rosy outlook reflects some of the recent science regarding e-cigarettes. \nFor example, a September study   Heart Association linked the nicotine in e-cigarettes to adrenaline level spikes that could increase the risk of heart attack . Also, a study in JAMA Pediatrics estimated that teens and young adults who use e-cigarettes are nearly four times more likely to graduate to full-fledged tobacco smoking . \nNevertheless, both scenarios predicted that millions of former smokers would live many more years thanks to e-cigarettes. \n\"What the scientists have discovered is it's not the nicotine that causes nearly all the deaths,\" Levy said. \"It's all the other stuff in cigarettes that people inhale.\" \nFDA regulation of e-cigarettes could pave the way to the devices becoming a more accepted form of nicotine replacement, Levy and DePalo said. \n\"The FDA has begun to look very seriously at an e-cigarette strategy,\" Levy said. \"The FDA commissioner explicitly stated about two months ago that e-cigs will be a prime component of tobacco control strategies here on.\" \nBut DePalo worries that such a strategy might imply that continued nicotine addiction is acceptable compared to the hazards of smoking , unless more is done to help e-cigarette users eventually wean themselves off the devices. \n\"As a pulmonologist, the idea that tobacco could be outlawed is so appealing to me,\" DePalo said. \"That's what we all want. The question is, would we be making a deal with the devil regarding e-cigarettes? If they were regulated by the FDA, maybe that deal is one we want to make.\" \nThe new study was published Oct. 2 in the journal Tobacco Control .

Latest Alzheimers News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nFrontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is the most common type of dementia to strike men and women under 60, the study team noted. \nThe investigation revealed that families caring for a patient with FTD face an annual bill of nearly $120,000, on average. That's roughly twice the cost of caring for a senior with Alzheimer's , the researchers said. \n\"For years, we have known about the extraordinary economic burden shouldered by FTD caregivers, but now we have the numbers to prove it,\" said Susan Dickinson, CEO for the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration. \"This study shows that the financial toll of FTD is even more devastating than we imagined.\" \nThe study was led by Dr. James Galvin, of Florida Atlantic University College of Medicine. He and his colleagues surveyed 674 caregivers of patients with this early onset dementia. \nThe research team determined that the patient's young age is largely responsible for the enormously high cost of providing care. On top of rising personal health costs, families also must cope with the loss of the patient's prior income. They said family caregivers often leave their paid jobs as well. \nLooking at patients with this devastating disease, investigators found that the average patient's household income was between $75,000 and $90,000 a year before diagnosis. Those numbers fell to between $50,000 and $59,000 by one year after a diagnosis. \nMaking matters worse, poor financial decisions are a symptom of this type of dementia. Nearly six in 10 caregivers reported that their loved one had made bad choices with money, the research shows. \nThe findings were published online Oct. 4 in Neurology . \n-- Alan Mozes Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Latest Infectious Disease News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nThe vaccine safely produced Zika -specific antibodies in 100 percent of the people involved in the study. \n\" Zika virus continues to be a threat to people living in the Americas and the Caribbean,\" said study author Dr. Pablo Tebas, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \n\"With these new results, we are one step closer to hopefully finding a way to prevent infection, which can cause serious birth defects and developmental delays in babies born to women who are infected with Zika ,\" he said. \nThe synthetic DNA-based Zika vaccine is known as GLS-5700. Unlike some vaccines that use weakened or killed versions of a virus, the experimental Zika vaccine contains synthetic DNA instructions that enable the immune system to neutralize the virus. The vaccine was developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, GeneOne Life Science and The Wistar Institute. \n\"Synthetic DNA vaccines are an ideal approach for emerging infectious diseases like Zika,\" study co-author David Weiner said in a Wistar news release. He's director of the institute's Vaccine & Immunotherapy Center. \nWeiner said this new generation of DNA vaccines has significant advantages. They can be designed and manufactured rapidly. They also appear to be highly predictable for the generation of immunity in humans. \nPlus, these vaccines are more stable than most traditional vaccines, \"making them exceptionally practical to distribute during outbreaks, especially in regions where resources are limited and we need to be able to respond quickly to curb an emerging epidemic,\" Weiner said. \nThe trial included 40 people. It was conducted in 2016 from August to September. The participants were divided into two groups that received two different doses of the vaccine when the study began. \nThe study volunteers received additional doses at four and 12 weeks. Each dosage was delivered with Cellectra, a device that produces small, electric currents that help the body produce an immune response to the vaccine. \nTwo weeks after receiving the final dose of the vaccine, all 40 of the people involved in the study developed Zika-specific antibodies, the study showed. \nThe researchers noted that 80 percent of the participants developed significant protection against the virus. None of the people had a negative reaction to the vaccine. \nBlood collected from the participants was also able to protect mice with weakened immune systems from Zika after they were infected with the virus. \nThis suggests that the antibodies triggered by the vaccine can prevent infection in living organisms. \nThe vaccine will need to be tested in larger trials. \nThe findings were published Oct. 5 in the New England Journal of Medicine . \nThis group of researchers isn't the only one working on Zika protection. Researchers from the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine reported Wednesday that they've developed a \"cocktail\" containing three potent antibodies. This cocktail was able to completely prevent Zika infection in a group of four lab monkeys. \nEven if successful in future research trials , it's still only a temporary measure. But it would provide immediate protection. And, that could potentially protect the fetuses of pregnant women living in or traveling to areas where Zika is endemic. \nThat study was published in the journal Science Translational Medicine . \n-- Mary Elizabeth Dallas Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Latest Infectious Disease News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nNow, research suggests one solution may be within arm's reach -- literally. \nPhysicians' white coats with sleeves above the elbow were much less likely to have traces of infectious viruses on them than long-sleeved versions, the study found. \n\"These results provide support for the recommendation that health care personnel wear short sleeves to reduce the risk for pathogen transmission,\" concluded a team led by Amrita John. She's an infectious disease specialist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland. \nAccording to the team, \"physicians' white coats are frequently contaminated, but seldom cleaned.\" \nFor that very reason, the United Kingdom already mandates that doctors be \"bare below the elbows\" as a means of lowering the chance that germs on a dirty coat sleeve will be transmitted to a patient. \nBut is sleeve length really a factor in the transmission of infections? \nTo find out, John's group had health care workers wear either short- or long-sleeved white coats while examining a mannequin with surfaces that had been contaminated with a harmless-but-communicable virus. \nThe workers then went and examined a second mannequin -- replicating normal hospital \"rounds\" where doctors might visit numerous patients. \nThe researchers then tested both the sleeves and the wrists of each worker for a certain \"DNA marker\" that indicated the presence of the virus. \nThe result: \"contamination with the DNA marker was detected significantly more often on the sleeves and/or wrists when personnel wore long- versus short-sleeved coats,\" the researchers reported. \nIn fact, while virus was detected on none of the sleeves or wrists of 20 workers wearing the short-sleeved coats, it was found on one-quarter (five out of 20) of those donning long sleeves. \nAnd in one of those cases, the virus had made its way to the second mannequin -- showing how a doctor's sleeve might transmit germs patient-to-patient. \nThe findings add weight to the recommendation for short-sleeved coats for physicians, the researchers noted. \nDr. Alan Mensch is a pulmonologist and senior vice president of medical affairs at Northwell Health's Syosset Hospital in Syosset, N.Y. Reviewing the findings, he agreed that keeping in-hospital infections to a minimum is crucial. \n\"Patients come to the hospital to get well, and it is the hospital's duty to accomplish that without causing a new infection,\" he said. \nHe called the new findings \"intriguing,\" but said they also raise many questions. \n\"Though short sleeves may prevent transmission of [viral] DNA, will they decrease infections?\" he wondered. And, \"Should we advise health care providers to wash their wrists along with their hands -- and will that decrease infection transmission?\" \nThe findings were presented Oct. 4 in San Diego at ID Week, the annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Experts note that findings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. \n-- E.J. Mundell Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

Latest Neurology News Want More News? Sign Up for MedicineNet Newsletters! \nThe disease, called adrenoleukodystrophy, affects about one in every 21,000 boys and occurs when boys lack one copy of the X chromosome. This leaves them unable to manufacture a protein that helps break down certain fatty acids. Acid buildup then begins to attack nerves, muscles and the brain. \nMost boys with the disease do not reach adulthood. \nUntil now, the only viable treatment has been a kind of stem cell therapy, but it comes with dangers and only one in five boys with the disease can find a suitable stem cell donor. \nBut the new gene therapy, reported online Oct. 4 in the New England Journal of Medicine , gets around that problem. Doctors remove the boy's own stem cells , genetically alter them in the lab so they now carry the missing gene behind adrenoleukodystrophy, and then inject the altered stem cells back into the patient. \nFifteen of the 17 boys who tried the therapy in the new study are neurologically stable and have no disability two years later, according to a team led by Dr. Florian Eichler, of Harvard Medical School in Boston. All of the boys had a severe form of the disease, affecting the brain. \nWriting in a journal editorial, Dr. Marc Engelen, of Emma Children's Hospital in Amsterdam, said that he believes the treatment \"will have a positive impact on the lives of our patients.\" \n\"For many years, gene therapy has shown great promise, but clinical applications have always seemed just beyond the horizon,\" Engelen wrote. But the new approach \"appears to be poised as a real treatment option for cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy,\" he added. \nPaul and Liliana Rojas, of Dover Plains, N.Y., have two sons -- Brian, 7, and Brandon, 10 -- affected by adrenoleukodystrophy. Because the therapy is only effective when used early in the disease, Brian was able to get the treatment while his older brother was not, the couple told the Associated Press . \nAccording to his parents, Brandon appeared to be a typical child until about the age of 7, when he began to drool and experience learning problems at school. His adrenoleukodystrophy diagnosis came three years ago, and at the time doctors advised that Brian get tested, too. \n\"We were driving to one of the Disney parks and had to pull over to get the call,\" Paul Rojas told the AP . \"Once we got off the phone, we both looked at each other and said we need to move forward now and save our younger son any way we can.\" \nThe new treatment is likely to be expensive. According to Engelen, a similar therapy, used for another rare disease, had a price tag over about $1 million per patient. \nAccording to the AP , costs for the boys treated in the study were covered by government grants and the therapy's maker, Bluebird Bio Inc., of Cambridge, Mass. \nAnd not all of the boys benefited, the researchers noted. Two of the 17 boys died -- one from the disease itself, and the other from complications linked to a donor transplant after the boy had withdrawn from the study. \nWill this treatment receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration? Current FDA rules require that outcomes for gene therapy recipients be tracked for 15 years, so the boys in the Boston trial will continue to be monitored. Speaking to the AP , lead researcher Dr. David Williams said that eight more boys are being enrolled into the study as Bluebird seeks approval for the treatment in the United States and Europe. \nAdrenoleukodystrophy first came to public attention with the release of the movie \"Lorenzo's Oil\" in 1992. The film depicted the true-life fight of one couple to develop their own treatment from olive and rapeseed oils to help their son, Lorenzo. While the treatment didn't turn out to be a cure, Lorenzo died in 2008 at age 30, two decades longer than most patients' expected lifespan. \n-- E.J. Mundell Copyright \u00a9 2017 HealthDay.

And the numbers are rising, with those in urban areas particularly affected, according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.   \nSymptoms in the fall are most likely caused by ragweed. Summer sneezes? Blame grass and weed pollens. Symptoms in the spring? You're probably allergic to tree pollen . \nClimate change is making things worse. The spring allergy season is starting earlier and lasting longer. And ragweed pollen is being produced for a longer period, too. \nThese allergies can start at any age -- often by age 10. But you can develop them as an adult, too. \nYour doctor can diagnose seasonal allergies based on your symptoms, a physical exam and, sometimes, allergy tests. He or she can then prescribe medication to tamp down your reaction. \nHere are other ways to cope when pollen is making you miserable. \nTry to stay inside between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m. during ragweed season. Schedule outdoor activities for late afternoon when pollen counts are usually lower. Keep your grass short and wear a mask if you have to mow it yourself. \nUse a clothes dryer instead of an outdoor clothesline to keep pollen off your clothes. Turn on an air conditioner instead of opening your windows. Avoid window and attic fans, which just blow allergens into your home. \nAlso consider getting an indoor air purifier with a HEPA filter to trap as many allergens as possible, but have someone else change the filter for you as needed. If allergies seem out of control, it may be time to check in with an allergist -- often an ENT, or ear, nose and throat specialist.
