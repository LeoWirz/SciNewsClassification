Are they better prepared to challenge this time around?", "text": "Alistair Tweedale 3 October 2017 \u2022 11:53am \nT here is no doubt this is a very different Manchester City side to the team of one year ago: a \u00a3220million spending spree would do that to you. \nMuch-changed personnel now combine with those who managed to remain in Pep Guardiola's plans and are understandably significantly better-schooled in his teachings 12 months down the line. \nBut City are now only one point better off than they were after seven games in 2016/17; it was at this stage last season that their title challenge fell apart, starting with a 2-0 defeat at Tottenham on Oct 2 . Prior to that loss City had won six from six, giving them an even better record than they had at the same stage this season. \nWhat followed was a huge shock. City drew three of their next four games, and lost three more times in December to leave them fifth at the turn of the year, having been four points clear at the top and looking a good bet for the title after six matches. \nAny similar capitulation would be similarly shocking this time around, but are they now better equipped to maintain a proper title challenge? Pep's team crumbled at White Hart Lane this time last season in what was the start of a terrible run of results Credit: EPA \nB esides having removed much of the deadwood from the squad and strengthened individuals in more areas than many clubs could dream of, City are now a better collective than they were a year ago. \nRoughly speaking, they have faced a similar level of opposition in their first seven games this season compared to last. \nBoth times they have played two of the other 'big six' sides in their first seven games, though the crucial difference this season has been the convincing nature with which they saw off both Liverpool and Chelsea , where last season they impressed in winning at Old Trafford but crumbled meekly away to Spurs, and the statistics bear out proof that they are now a much-improved side. Manchester City first seven games | Premier League \nC ity are retaining possession better than they were a year ago, with around 69 per cent possession compared to 63 per cent last season and 89 per cent passing accuracy, up from 84 per cent. \nThey are doing more with that possession, having had 101 shots in seven games in 2017/18 compared to 85 at this stage last season. They are hitting the target and scoring with roughly the same efficiency, and having had more attempts they have therefore scored more. \nWith marauding full-backs that Pep is now much happier with , and flying, speedy, tricky wingers, City stretch the play and constantly get the ball into dangerous, wide positions high up the pitch, as was seen to devastating effect at Chelsea over the weekend. \nThe cohesion with which their attack now plays has produced staggering results, and the individual is now far less important than the collective. Attempted dribbles by City players are down 31 per cent on this time last season (121 down from 176), but the wide players - traditionally those you would expect to find dribbling - still retain real value. Man City's first 7 games performance \nC ity have attempted 122 crosses in open play this season - nearly double the 66 they had put in at this stage last term - while they have scored four goals from crosses in open play this season, where a year ago they hadn't scored any. \nWhile the attacking changes have been stark, there have been crucial changes at the other end, too. \nCity have conceded only two goals so far this season, where a year ago they had shipped seven, but it isn't just the upgrade from Claudio Bravo to Ederson between the sticks that has had a significant effect. \nTheir defenders are being pulled out of position less often, and are therefore being forced into fewer 'defensive actions' such as tackles and interceptions. The best defenders allowing their reading of the game and positioning to do the hard work, and that is increasingly the case for Nicolas Otamendi and John Stones in what is a noticeably more organised team. John Stones has made an impressive start to the season Credit: Getty images \nA major consequence of this is that City's players have committed only three errors leading to opposition chances this season, compared to six at the same stage last season. Stones looks like he could develop Under Guardiola into the defender he has long suggested he could one day be. \nSo, is this a team that can challenge? \nThe early signs certainly suggest City are markedly stronger than they were a year ago, but nobody expected last season's collapse and Pep Guardiola will remain wary despite increased confidence in his players. \nThey may now an even greater number of incredible individuals but, crucially, the collective Manchester City now amounts to far more than they did a season ago. A genuine title tilt is considerably more likely this time around.

He said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate about what\u2019s in their heads. They obviously don\u2019t feel comfortable. I\u2019ve spoken to the Premier League, the EFL [English Football League], the PFA [Professional Footballers\u2019 Association], the LMA [League Managers\u2019 Association].\n\u201cWe are all desperate to make the game more LGBT-inclusive. We haven\u2019t yet won the trust of the professional gay players. I\u2019ve reached out. I\u2019ve seen athletes, swimmers, divers, I\u2019ve gone everywhere. And they\u2019ve shared their views with me. I\u2019ve said, \u2018Why won\u2019t gay footballers meet me?\u2019. They\u2019ve all said, \u2018I don\u2019t know because I don\u2019t know any gay footballers\u2019. They\u2019re very deeply buried.\u201d\nAt professional level, Thomas Hitzlsperger (Aston Villa and West Ham) and Robbie Rogers (Leeds United) have both spoken of their homosexuality, but only after leaving the English game or retiring. In May, Liam Davis became the first openly gay footballer to play at Wembley, in the FA Vase final.\nThomas Hitzlsperger is one of very few footballers to have spoken openly about their sexuality Credit: pa C larke says he has also tried to break down barriers for black coaches and managers, and heard an alarming claim that \u201cawkward\u201d individuals in that field are more likely to suffer consequences.\n\u201cWhen I had the same conversation with black managers, BAME managers [about problems faced], I ended up in a situation where I was meeting clandestinely with black players and black managers,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cI was in a coffee bar talking to a really nice guy who\u2019s a black manager and he said, \u2018Let me tell you something, Greg. It\u2019s really hard to get a job as a manager. It\u2019s doubly hard to get a job as a black manager. But if you\u2019re an awkward black manager - forget it. We can\u2019t get a reputation for being difficult\u2019.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say who they were. All the black managers and players I met years ago when I was putting the Rooney rule [on job interview ratios] in place - I never said a word about any of them.\u201d\nClarke accepted that gay footballers were under no obligation to reveal their sexuality. He said: \u201cWhy would you sign up for that potential risk if it\u2019s working for you, if you\u2019re happy? You might think, \u2018Why do I need to share my sexuality with anybody?\u2019.

But from May 2018, the two cities will be linked with a daily flight, courtesy of Qatar Airways. \nDo the rugby-mad residents of the Welsh capital long to explore the souks and skyscrapers of Doha? Are Qatari businesses itching to invest in South Wales? The chief executive of Qatar Airways (Akbar Al Bakerm) thinks so \u2013 but is facing stern opposition from inside his own company. At a glance | Cardiff v Doha \nThe chief executive this week admitted that he has come under pressure to ditch the plans, with colleagues suggesting the demand simply isn\u2019t there. But he is adamant it will be a success. \n\"Wales is a huge developing state,\u201d he told the BBC . \u201cIt was important that we operate and connect the people of Wales, and the South West, with the rest of the world.\u201d Cardiff, capital of rugby-loving Wales Credit: \u00a9travelwitness - stock.adobe.com \nHe added: \"When a child needs a bar of chocolate you don't give it in pieces. The region was longing for an international flight and as one of the world's only five-star airlines, why shouldn't we go daily?\" \nThe decision to launch the route was made in April, however, before the ongoing dispute between Qatar and its Middle Eastern neighbours, over its alleged support of international terror groups (allegations which are denied by rulers in Doha). Qatar Airways is currently banned from flying to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain, and has been banned from entering the airspace of those nations too. That means circuitous routes to dozens of destinations, longer journey times for travellers, and bigger fuel bills. Cerys Matthews: Why Cardiff is Britain's most underrated city \nBut Deb Barber, Cardiff Airport\u2019s chief executive, points out that 1.4 million passengers from Wales and the South West already fly to the Middle East each year using other UK airports. \nShould the service prove a success, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time a curious air route has defied the odds. \nA peek at the aviation analyst OAG\u2019s pocket flight guide reveals a whole raft of unlikely cities linked by air. Cardiff\u2019s route map is decidedly unexotic, with nothing beyond mainstream Europe, but Qatar Airways has already made a success of direct flights to Atlanta, Chengdu, Djibouti, Ho Chi Minh City, Kiev, Skopje, Tbilisi and Yerevan (as well as the Uganda town of Entebbe). And if Wizz Air can fill flights from Doncaster to Cluj-Napoca (that\u2019s in Romania), why shouldn\u2019t Cardiff-Doha prove profitable? The Yorkshire airport also has links with Lublin and Katowice in Poland, alongside less surprising destinations like Faro, Amsterdam and Malaga.

Theresa May was not among them in an apparent snub to her potential leadership rival that aides said was caused by a diary clash.\nMr Johnson swore his loyalty to the Prime Minister, saying \u201cthe whole country owes her a debt for her steadfastness in taking Britain forward\u201d and that she will secure \u201ca great Brexit deal\u201d.\nBut his speech did little to dampen suggestions that he is positioning himself as Mrs May's replacement. Last night colleagues said he was still \u201cwielding the knife behind his back\u201d.\nBritain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson addresses the Conservative Party conference in Manchester Credit: REUTERS/Phil Noble A fter a week in which the party\u2019s annual gathering has been dominated by questions over Mrs May\u2019s future and Mr Johnson\u2019s intentions, the Prime Minister is aware that her own conference speech on Wednesday could determine whether the party decides to let her continue as leader.\nMr Johnson, who has repeatedly challenged Mrs May\u2019s authority in recent weeks by setting out his own vision for Brexit, did little to dampen speculation that he is preparing for a future tilt at the leadership.\nHe urged the party to \u201cbe bold and seize the opportunities\u201d in what could be interpreted as an appeal to oust Mrs May and install him in her place.\nHe said: \u201cWe can win the future because we are the party that believes in this country and we believe in the potential of the British people\u2026we are not the lion, we do not claim to be the lion - that role is played by the people of this country. \u201cBut it is up to us now \u2013 in the traditional non-threatening, genial and self-deprecating way of the British \u2013 to let that lion roar.\u201d\nForeign Secretary Boris Johnson Credit: Christopher Furlong/Getty T he most memorable phrase of his speech was inspired by Churchill, who told Parliament in 1954 that it was the British people who \u201chad the lion\u2019s heart\u201d and that \u201cI had the luck to be called upon to give the roar\u201d.\nChurchill used the phrase during an address to mark his 80th birthday, when he was facing calls to resign because of his age and increasingly frail health.\nThe Roaring Lion is also the title given to a 1941 photographic portrait of Churchill that appears on the cover of Mr Johnson\u2019s own book about the former Conservative prime minister.\nMr Johnson\u2019s speech went way beyond foreign policy and although it had been vetted by Downing Street, it included numerous ad-libs as he read from notes rather than using an autocue.\nHe described Jeremy Corbyn as \u201ca disgrace\u201d who would inflict a \u201cnational humiliation\u201d on Britain and drive talent away through high taxation.\nHe also set out the advantages of capitalism and free markets, and said the difference between the Conservatives and Labour is that: \u201cWe want a country with a government that works for everyone; Corbyn wants a Britain where everyone works for the government.\u201d\nThe sombre mood of the Conservative conference after June\u2019s general election losses has contrasted sharply with the jubilation of last week\u2019s Labour gathering, but Mr Johnson succeeded in lifting the spirits of delegates with his oration.\nMr Johnson said he had never known so many people to be \u201csunk in gloom and dubitation about Britain and the world\u201d and suggested the executive class in Europe thought \u201cthat we are going to bottle out of Brexit and end up in some dingy ante-room of the EU, pathetically waiting for the scraps but no longer in control of the menu\u201d.\nIn an attack on so-called \u201cremoaners\u201d in the Cabinet, he said it was \u201ctime to stop treating the referendum result as though it were a plague of boils\u201d and instead \u201cto be bold and to seize the opportunities\u201d.\nIn his vision of Britain the UK is \u201ca gigantic cyclotron of talent\u201d and the world capital of innovation on the verge of a \u201ccultural, technological and commercial renaissance\u201d.\nOne Government minister told The Daily Telegraph: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see this as anything other than Boris setting the ground for a future run on the leadership.\n\u201cHe set out a broad agenda, straying far beyond his brief - he was talking about housing, education, Brexit, the whole piece.\n\u201cWhile it's good to see him get behind Theresa May, no doubt he is wielding the knife behind his back. He will have to do a lot more to win the support of the party and his colleagues.\u201d\nNo senior Cabinet ministers attended Mr Johnson\u2019s speech, and some cracked jokes at his expense in their own speeches.\nDavid Davis, the Brexit Secretary, told the delegates: \u201cWe train the best diplomats and put them to the test by sending them to work for the Foreign Secretary.\u201d\nSir Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, said the Government\u2019s \u00a318 billion defence spending \u201creally is \u00a3350 million a week\u201d - a reference to Mr Johnson\u2019s disputed claim about money that is sent to Brussels each week.\nHe also mocked Mr Johnson\u2019s rhetoric by saying that the Royal Navy\u2019s latest aircraft carrier \u201cis the lion that really roars\u201d.\nDowning Street said Mrs May had not been able to attend Mr Johnson\u2019s speech because she was carrying out a round of television interviews ahead of her own speech.\nShe used the interviews to insist she was not afraid of dissenting voices in Cabinet such as Mr Johnson\u2019s and said the Foreign Secretary\u2019s interventions did not undermine her, indicating she has no intention of sacking him.\nShe said: \u201cI think actually strong leadership is about having a range of voices sitting around the table. I don't think it's strong leadership just to have yes men.\u201d\n5:24PM 'It doesn't undermine what I am doing at all' I n a round of TV interviews this evening, the Prime Minister insisted she still had the authority to push through her agenda.\nAsked whether Mr Johnson's interventions were undermining her position, she told the BBC:\nIt doesn't undermine what I am doing at all. There is a lot of talk about Boris's job or this job or that job inside the Cabinet.\nActually, what people are concerned about - they don't want us to be thinking about our jobs, they want us to be thinking about their jobs and their futures.\nAsked by Channel 4 if he was enjoying being PM, she said:\nYes. It\u2019s not miserable, Jon, and the reason it\u2019s not miserable is because as Prime Minister I can ensure that government takes decisions that really improve people\u2019s lives.\n4:55PM Minister says Brexit result of working class 'tantrums' T he EU referendum vote was in part the result of working class voters throwing a \"bit of a tantrum\" over immigration, a Foreign Office minister has said.\nSir Alan Duncan, said traditional blue-collar Labour supporters had been \"stirred up\" by the immigration issue in the final days of the campaign.\nSpeaking in the United States, he said the Government's job now was to ensure that Brexit became \"an opportunity not a disaster\".\nAlan Duncan H is comments came amid continuing tensions among senior ministers over the direction of the Brexit negotiations.\nSir Alan, who campaigned for Remain in the referendum, said some of the anger directed towards immigrants had been \"slightly artificial\" as people in the UK did not want the jobs they were taking.\nSpeaking during a question and answer session at The Chicago Council on Global Affairs, he said:\nThe manner in which the campaign was fought stirred up a lot of sentiment amongst people who were not habitual voters, particularly on the issue of immigration.\nYou could feel blue-collar, urban, traditional Labour opinion going viral for Leave. They were stirred up by an image of immigration which made them angry and made them throw a bit of a tantrum.\nHe said it was \"one of the paradoxes\" of the campaign that Boston in Lincolnshire had voted so heavily for Leave when the local agricultural sector was dependent on migrant workers from Poland.\nHe said:\nLincolnshire folk if you like said 'Oh, they are coming to pinch our jobs'. Well, they wouldn't do the jobs themselves anyway so it was a slightly artificial anger.\nSir Alan, who is the minister for Europe and the Americas, said the Government was now trying to make the best of the result.\nHe said:\nWe have to make the most of what we are now required to do by the referendum to try and turn it into an opportunity and not a disaster.\nHe was also highly critical of the way the Remain campaign led by David Cameron and George Osborne had been fought which, he said, contributed to the outcome.\nThe Remain campaign was badly conducted in that the then government under David Cameron and George Osborne very much hogged the campaign limelight and it didn't look as though the Remain argument put a vision of optimism.\nNor did it appear a cross-party endeavour.\nThat made elements of voting opinion treat it as a verdict on the government of the day which invariably creates anti feelings and that converted into votes.\nThat I think explains part of the chemistry that led to the result.\nReport from the Press Association\n4:26PM David Davis: We are making contingency plans for 'no deal' Davis: We are making contingency plans for \"no deal\" 00:34 4:04PM Boris Johnson: It is time for the British lion to roar T he Foreign Secretary closes with this: \"There are people say we can\u2019t do it. We say we can.\n\"We can win the future because we are the party that believes in this country and we believe in the potential of the British people.\n\"We have been privileged collectively to be placed in charge of this amazing country at a critical moment in our history.\n\"We are not the lion. We do not claim to be the lion.\n\"That role is played by the people of this country. But it is up to us now \u2013 in the traditional non-threatening, genial and self-deprecating way of the British \u2013 to let that lion roar.\"\nMr Johnson is given a standing ovation.\n4:00PM Boris Johnson calls for Brexit positivity H e says: \"It is time to stop treating the referendum result as though it were a plague of boils or a murrain on our cattle or an inexplicable aberration by 17.4 m people. It is time to be bold, and to seize the opportunities and there is no country better placed than Britain.\"\nBoris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary Credit: Matthew Lloyd/Bloomberg\n3:56PM Boris Johnson claims UK will 'find cure' for 'contamination of radical Islamist extremism' T he Foreign Secretary says: \"If we can drive on that great cause of female empowerment and education, the Swiss army knife that solves so many problems, then I believe we will eventually find a cure for the psychological contamination of radical Islamist extremism, just as we have eradicated smallpox and polio.\n\"It came and it will go.\"\n3:54PM Boris Johnson: UK will be no less European post-Brexit Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary Credit: Peter Byrne/PA H e says: \"Yes we are leaving the EU \u2013 but as the PM has said in her Florence speech we can create a deep and special partnership built on free trade with a strong EU buttressed and supported by a strong UK.\n\"And since it is manifestly absurd to argue that European values or culture or civilisation are somehow defined or delimited by the institutions of the EU, we will be no less European.\n\"Britain will continue to be European in culture, geography, history, architecture, spiritually, morally probably, you name it.\n\"We are one of the great quintessential European nations.\"\n3:52PM Boris Johnson: UK to push UN for collective response to North Korea crisis H e says: \"We are big enough to do amazing things.\n\"We have the ability to project force 7000 miles, to use our permanent membership of the UN sec council to mobilise a collective response to the crisis in North Korea.\n\"We contribute 25 per cent of European aid spending and yet no one seriously complains that we are bullies or have a sinister national agenda and that is why the phrase global Britain makes sense because if you said Global China or global Russia or even alas Global America it would not have quite the same flavour.\"\n3:51PM Boris Johnson makes Russian 'honey traps' joke H e says: \"I have just seen the 800 British troops in Estonia and congratulated them on resisting the honey traps allegedly placed in their way by Russian intelligence. At least they said they had resisted.\"\n3:46PM Boris Johnson: 1970s socialism is back from the grave M r Johnson says the Labour leader is \"seriously proposing to put place the British people back in bondage\" with a \u00a3200 billion renationalisation programme.\nHe says: \"A display of economic masochism that would do incalculable damage to the future of our children.\n\"That\u2019s the difference between this Conservative party and the Labour party. We want a country with a government that works for everyone.\nBoris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary Credit: Owen Humphreys/PA \"Corbyn wants a Britain where everyone works for the government. This battle of ideas is not lost in memories of the 1970s.\n\"It is back from the grave. Its zombie fingers straining for the levers of power and that is why we cannot rest.\"\n3:44PM Boris Johnson: Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell offering a semi-Marxist agenda H e says: \"If you listen to the aspirations of the young people I meet around the world, you will find there is not a single successful global economy that would dream of implementing the semi-Marxist agenda of McDonnell and Corbyn of nationalisation and state control.\"\n3:42PM Boris Johnson: Jeremy Corbyn did not win the election, Theresa May did T he Foreign Secretary tells activists: \"He didn\u2019t win. You won \u2013 we won. Theresa May won.\n\"She won more votes than any party leader and took this party to its highest share of the vote in any election in the last 25 years and the whole country owes her a debt for her steadfastness in taking Britain forward as she will to a great Brexit deal.\n\"Based on that Florence speech on whose every syllable, I can tell you the whole cabinet is united.\"\n3:40PM Boris Johnson attacks Jeremy Corbyn H e says: \"That Nato bashing, Trident scrapping, would-be abolisher of the British army whose first instinct in the event of almost any international outrage or disaster is to upend the analysis until he can find a way of blaming British foreign policy.\n\"And whose response to the grisly events in Venezuela is to side with the regime \u2013 simply because they are fellow lefties.\n\"He says he still admires Bolivarian revolutionary socialism. I say he\u2019s Caracas.\"\n3:39PM Boris Johnson attacks press for making it seem like UK is going to 'bottle out of Brexit' H e says: \"As I absorb the general tone of the national conversation I don\u2019t think I have ever known so many to be sunk in gloom and dubitation about Britain and the world.\n\"Every week I pick up British-edited international magazines, of the kind that you will find in the briefcases of jet setting consultants.\n\"Glossy-covered, elegantly written, suspiciously unread.\n\"And every week these publications have found new reasons to be slightly less than cheerful about this country.\n\"Every day a distinguished pink newspaper manages to make Eeyore look positively exuberant and across the world the impression is being given that this country is not up to it.\n\"That we are going to bottle out of Brexit and end up in some dingy ante-room of the EU, pathetically waiting for the scraps but no longer in control of the menu.\"\n3:37PM Boris Johnson begins Tory conference speech with tribute to Las Vegas victims T he Foreign Secretary is now on stage and he starts by paying tribute to the victims of the Las Vegas shooting.\nHe says: \"Our hearts go out to Las Vegas. Today we are reminded once again of the attack that took place here only a few months ago, on innocent and music-loving young people.\n\"And if there is a message to our American friends it is this: that they will come through it and they will come back from it stronger.\n\"Because this city has shown that nothing and no one can bow the indomitable spirit of the people of Manchester, which in recent years has reinvented itself as the great thrumming engine of the northern powerhouse.\"\n3:34PM Sir Michael Fallon says Britain must defend its values against threat of terror T he Defence Secretary closes his speech with this: \"With the fifth biggest defence budget in the world, we have the means. So we must always be ready to answer the call from further away, from fragile democracies, from the very poorest, from the hardest hit.\n\"That means deploying our ships, our planes, and yes, our troops on the ground where we and our allies are asked to help.\n\"Standing up for what we believe in, standing up for Global Britain.\u201d\n3:31PM Sir Michael Fallon announces every role in Armed Forces to be open to women T he Defence Secretary says: \"I also want to attract more ethnic minority and female recruits.\n\"I set a target for 10 per cent of recruits in future to come from a black, Asian, or minority ethnic background by 2020 - seven per cent now do.\n\"They\u2019re joining some who have already reached the ranks of Brigadier, Commodore, and Air Commodore. We are also on track to meet our target that 15% of new recruits should be female - but I want to do even better.\n\"So I\u2019m opening up every single role in our Armed Forces to women so that talent, not gender, determines how far you can go\n3:29PM Sir Michael Fallon issues warning over North Korea H e says: \"North Korea\u2019s illegal testing underlines just how irresponsible it would be to scrap the deterrent that protects us.\n\"It is all very well Jeremy Corbyn saying he would never use nuclear weapons but Manchester and London are closer to Pyongyang than Los Angeles.\n\"Being prepared, in the most extreme circumstances, to use nuclear weapons is what separates a Prime Minister from a pacifist.\"\n3:27PM Sir Michael Fallon attacks Jeremy Corbyn's views on defence H e tells the main hall: \"He wants to slash defence spending. He wouldn\u2019t authorise drone strikes on terrorists. He would abandon our NATO allies.\n\"We must never put the security of our country in the hands of a man whose warped worldview puts him side of those who threaten us.

The announcement formed part of a package of reforms aimed at luring young voters over to the Conservatives.\nDowning Street said the reforms would cost around \u00a31.2 billion between 2018/19 and 2021/22.\n1:22PM Better with Boris?

We meet it at the moment. We have also committed to increasing the budget ahead of inflation each year.\nBut we are reviewing now the threats to our country, which have intensified in the last couple of years.\nSo we do need to be sure that we have the resources that we need and we should aim to do better.\nThe Prime Minister is 100 per cent on my page, she understands very well the threats to our country.\nBREAK Fallon tells me UK should increase defence budget beyond the 2% commitment.

The Conservative party has always been, and always must be, the party of law and order. And I will give credit to previous Labour Home Secretaries that took important steps to improve our security.\nBut this lot are different.\nThey have spent three decades opposing anti-terrorist laws. They\u2019ve talked of their \u2018friends\u2019 in Hamas and Hezbollah. They are silent on the anti-semitism that festers in their Party. They won\u2019t clearly condemn the actions of the IRA. They don\u2019t support police officers shooting to kill. They\u2019ve called for the dismantling of the police, the disbandment of MI5 and the disarming of police officers.\nSaying you condemn all violence when specifically asked if you\u2019ll condemn one groups\u2019 actions isn\u2019t good enough. Staying silent when your supporters abuse and insult people because of their religion, sex or political views isn\u2019t good enough. Simply paying lip service to demonstrate your commitment to our security isn\u2019t good enough.\n12:31PM Boris goes jogging ahead of conference speech Boris goes jogging ahead of conference speech 00:49 12:25PM Rudd announces new offence to prevent sale of acid to under 18s A mber Rudd says acid attacks are \"absolutely revolting\" and ruin lives.\nShe announces new offence to prevent sale of acid to under 18s.\nShe says:\nAcid attacks are absolutely revolting. You have all seen the pictures of victims that never fully recover. Endless surgeries. Lives ruined.\nSo today, I am also announcing a new offence to prevent the sale of acids to under 18s.

Our children\u2019s futures depend on it.\nThese negotiations are going to be challenging. But great challenges also bring great opportunities.\nWith David Davis, I have proposed an ambitious new security treaty. So that even as we leave the EU, we can continue to work with our European allies to keep us safe.\nAnd later in the year we will publish a paper on our future immigration system \u2013 showing how we will have greater control over our immigration rules in the future. But also how there will be no cliff edge for businesses. Because I appreciate it will take time for them to adjust after over 40 years of free movement.\nAs we build that new immigration system and deliver on the result of last year\u2019s referendum, I\u2019m committed to working with businesses, both large and small, to make sure we don\u2019t impose unnecessary burdens, or create damaging labour shortages.\n12:19PM 'We are tightening our laws' A mber Rudd says the Government will introduce tougher measures to tackle extremist material online.\nShe says:\nExtremists and terrorist material can still be published online, and is then too easily accessible on some devices within seconds...\nMessages of hatred and violence accessible from any laptop or smart phone.\nProgress has been made, but this has got to stop.\nToday I am announcing that we are tightening our laws for individuals looking at this type of material online.\nWe will change the law, so that people who repeatedly view terrorist content online could face up to 15 years in prison. This will close an important gap in legislation. At present, the existing offence applies only if you have downloaded or stored such material \u2013 not if you are repeatedly viewing or streaming it online. A critical difference.\nThe government will introduce another change, she says.\nWe will also change the law in another important way. If someone publishes information about our police or armed forces for the purpose of preparing an act of terrorism, then they could face up to fifteen years in prison.\n12:17PM 'Prevent works' A mber Rudd, the Home Secretary, is now addressing the conference hall.\nShe insists the programme Prevent works.\nShe says:\nWe all need to move more quickly to keep Britain safe.\nRemoving harmful material from the internet is a core activity of Prevent, our prime counter-radicalisation programme. But there is also a clear, human safeguarding element.\nIn London earlier this year, I met a mother whose son had travelled to Syria to fight for Da\u2019esh. She had no idea of his plan. She was devastated.\nBut it was not just her son who had been groomed by Da\u2019esh\u2019s toxic influence. Her daughter\u2019s school had concerns that she too might travel to Syria.\nThe local Prevent team provided counselling to both mother and daughter. Without the support that Prevent provided, it is likely she simply would not have known where else to turn.\nConference, Prevent works.\nThis is not to say that we cannot improve it. But I would issue this challenge today to its detractors: work with us, not against us.\nWe all have a role to play. Prevent isn\u2019t some \u2018Big Brother\u2019 monolithic beast.

The numbers are staggering. 1. The Las Vegas mass shooting wasn't the only mass shooting in America on Sunday \nWhile the scale of the attack in Las Vegas on Sunday night is unparalleled, it wasn't the only mass shooting to occur in the US that day. \nSome 13,000 miles away in Lawrence, just outside the University of Kansas in Kansas, two men and a woman were killed and a further two people injured in a mass shooting incident. \nWhile none of the three victims were students at the university, all were in their early twenties, with one of the young men recently having become a father, according to the local press . \nMass shootings in America - defined as an event where at least four people are shot - are now an every day event. \nThe Las Vegas attack makes October the most deadly month for mass shootings this year - although not by as much as some may think, given the scale of the atrocity. 2. One major mass shooting every two months \nT his year's deaths follow a depressing trend, according to data gathered by the Gun Violence Archive . \nS ome 346 people are estimated to have been killed in American mass shootings this year. This compared to 432 in 2016, and 369 in 2015 - more than one person for every day of the year. \nWhen it comes to major mass shootings (where more than four people are killed), there have been an average of just 72 days between events during the period of 2010 to 2017 . \nThis is a far more frequent rate when compared to the average gap of 162 days from 2000 to 2010, according to data compiled by Mother Jones . \nThe two worst mass shooting events - this week's Las Vegas shooting and the Pulse nightclub atrocity in Orlando - have occurred in the last two years. More than a person a day have been killed in US mass shootings in recent years 3. Firearms sales go up after mass shootings \nD ata from the FBI shows us that there have been 270million firearms background checks since November 1998 - and the number is increasing as time goes by. \nSuch background checks, initiated through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), do not represent the number of firearms sold - but they do give us an idea as to interest in buying guns across the country. \nIn an alarming pattern identified by the New York Times , the fear of firearms restrictions is a significant driver of gun sales - with mass shootings and other attacks being another, although to a lesser extent. \nF or example, December 2015 saw the highest number of background checks to date - at 3.3m. This followed the San Bernardino terror attack in November, in which 14 people died and after which Obama called for tighter restrictions on the purchase of assault rifles. Firearm checks peak after attacks and potential restrictions 4. 270m guns for 320m people \nI n 2007, the Small Arms Survey estimated that there were between 250m and 290m civilian-owned firearms in the US - a rate of around 90 per 100 people. \nThis was the highest rate of civilian guns for any of the 178 countries that were surveyed and was ahead of Yemen (55 guns per 100 civilians) in second place by quite some distance. \nHigher rates of gun ownership correlate strongly with occurrences of mass shootings with the US emerging at the top of tree when it came to mass shootings per head in a study by Jaclyn Schildkraut of the State University of New York. Countries with more guns have more mass shootings 5. Mass shootings are just the tip of the iceberg \nB etween 2001 and 2013, 406,496 people died as a result of gun violence in America according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. \nOf this number the majority - 237,052 - were actually suicides as opposed to homicides. \nH omicides accounted for 153,144 deaths over this period while the rest comprised 8,383 accidental deaths, 4,778 deaths from police shootings and 3,200 where the cause couldn't be determined. \nIn this context, mass shootings make up a comparatively small proportion of overall gun deaths in the US, accounting for around three per cent of homicides in 2017 so far according to the Gun Violence Archive. Suicides account for most US gun deaths 6. Texas is often at the frontline of mass shootings \nI n 2015, there were 45 deaths from Texan mass shootings . In 2016, the state saw 39 victims. This year, the running total is 28. \nWhile individual large tragedies may skew the data for particular years, Texas is consistently bad for gun violence. \nAfter the Las Vegas attack, Nevada has suffered the most deaths from mass shootings this year - at 59 deaths - but it is also top when we make the number proportional to a state's population. \nIt being a small state, Nevada has now had 20 mass shooting deaths per one million of its people - with the next highest rates seen in Mississippi (7.4 per million) and Kansas (3.4 per million). Map: America\u2019s mass shootings hotspots 7. Americans can't agree on gun control \nT he debate over gun rights and restrictions is not a new one in America - and it's opened up every time another mass shooting catches the public's attention. \nT he latest polling from the Pew Research Centre shows that 47 per cent of Americans support protecting gun rights - compared to 51 per cent who support gun control (6 April 2017). \nThis polling has tightened over the last two decades - when 65 per cent were in favour of gun control in May 1999 - ensuring that the debate continues to rage on. \nA t the end of 2016, The Telegraph published a piece called \"The face of America's gun problem\" which aimed to document all 432 victims of American mass shootings in 2016.

But could the focus on Help to Buy be responsible for the decline of another form of housebuyer assistance - shared ownership?\nWith Help to Buy, the Government gives qualifying homebuyers a loan (interest-free for five years) in order to reduce the size of their required mortgage. This gives them access to lower interest rates and puts more expensive properties within their reach.\nBy contrast, shared ownership allows buyers to own a portion of a property while renting the remainder from a housing association. Buyers have the option to \"staircase\" to full ownership later (see below).\nPrime Minister Theresa May has announced \u00a310bn of extra funding for the Help to Buy equity loan scheme Credit: Phil Noble/PA M ore than 50,000 shared ownership properties have been built since the scheme was promoted in 2010, but in recent years it appears to have lost popularity.\nWhile 11,420 units were built in 2014-15, the following two years saw a huge drop off, with 4,110 built in 2015-16 and 5,430 in 2016-17.\nMeanwhile, according to the Chartered Institute for Housing, the total number of affordable homes built in Britain fell by 50 percent between 2010-11 and 2016-17, from 56,000 to 28,000.\nWhy have fewer houses been built? Despite the decline, the Government continues to promote shared ownership - designating last week \"shared ownership week\" in a bid to rejuvenate interest in the programme.\nThe Department for Communities and Local Government, which oversees the programme, said the decline could be explained by the five-year \u201cdelivery\u201d cycles under which it operates.\nThe latest cycle runs from 2016 to 2021, and a spokesman said the number of shared ownership new-builds would pick up again in the next few years.\n\u201cThis Government is determined to make housing more affordable, increase supply and help more people get onto the housing ladder,\u201d he added. \u201cShared ownership plays a key part in this, helping young aspiring homebuyers to achieve their dream of home ownership.\u201d Shared ownership transactions have climbed slightly, with just over 12,000 taking place last year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sam meadows", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs cadwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill cadwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjorn howard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ross curry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer tristram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew boast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cadwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phil noble/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david o\u2019leary", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "local government", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aster homes  m rs cadwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "home builders federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chartered institute for housing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aster homes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cornwall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bristol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:42:20.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ebd2b0bbe4b104d4057ecc587aece575c83ab90a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROXzNkIHJ1sm_wTp3oGAOvPFJ89QKLoHRWjjoiYz7SjaQ1dxFj8fz9hdFt5GlZXFpdqszTkck9da9PI2B0wm_l.MnTThj7hAkNbpfZTCG.UPW", "site_full": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "site": "telegraph.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "www.telegraph.co.uk for the latest news from the UK and around the world.", "title": "DJ Tim Westwood at 60: why it's time to take UK rap's elder statesman seriously", "title_full": "DJ Tim Westwood at 60: why it's time to take UK rap's elder statesman seriously", "published": "2017-10-03T14:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/music/2017/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000142579340-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqy81pHNlW26k7kWS-Prb1CqST51K4pfD_v8j2pD2cvgE.jpeg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 317, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1453, "comments": 0, "shares": 1453}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ebd2b0bbe4b104d4057ecc587aece575c83ab90a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROXzNkIHJ1sm_wTp3oGAOvPFJ89QKLoHRWjjoiYz7SjaQ1dxFj8fz9hdFt5GlZXFpdqszTkck9da9PI2B0wm_l.MnTThj7hAkNbpfZTCG.UPW", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Hogan", "published": "2017-10-03T14:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "DJ Tim Westwood at 60: why it's time to take UK rap's elder statesman seriously", "text": "T im Westwood turns 60 today. It\u2019s safe to say he\u2019s not your average sexagenarian. Clad in puffa jacket, baggy jeans and Timberland boots, the evergreen DJ will celebrate the milestone either by pretending it isn\u2019t happening (he\u2019s got form for fibbing about his age) or by dropping block-rocking rap anthems well into the small hours. Quite probably both.\nHip-hop is now pop music \u2019s dominant form and somehow this gangly 6'4'' East Anglian saw it coming before anyone else in the country. The self-styled \u201cBig Dawg\u201d is a pioneer who, for the past 35 years, has been the most influential figure and foremost authority on the UK scene, if not Europe-wide. \nAs John Peel was to indie, Westwood is to hip-hop E ven nearing pensionable age, he remains the voice of rap.

It\u2019s just a shame he\u2019s easily dismissed as a joke figure so doesn\u2019t get his dues.\n\u201cThe man Westwood\u201d, after all, is the public school-educated bishop\u2019s son from the mean streets of downtown Lowestoft who turned himself into the high priest of hip-hop \u2013 while becoming the inspiration for Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s Ali G (although as Westwood says: \u201cI\u2019d rather be Ali G than Bruno.\u201d) A middle-class, middle-aged white man who acts like he\u2019s young, black and straight outta the \u2018hood.\nBig Dawg: Tim Westwood in the 1990s Credit: Television Stills B eneath the much-mocked \"wigga\" caricature, though, Tim \u201cno relation to Vivienne or Lee\u201d Westwood is your classic tale of a geek made good. A dyslexic who struggled at school, he was an early adopter of the genre that would go on to take over the world. During the late Seventies, he fell in love with electro funk and early rap, obsessively collecting vinyl, making mixtapes and hero-worshipping trailblazers like Jam Master Jay and DJ Funkmaster Flex. \nLeaving home and heading for London, he gravitated towards the music business. Starting out as a roadie and West End nightclub glass collector, Westwood persuaded his boss to give him a spin on the decks as warm-up for top-of-the-bill names like dancehall don David Rodigan. His infectious passion and nerdy knowledge soon shone through. \nAfter serving his DJing apprenticeship on London pirate station Kiss FM (which the ever canny Westwood co-owned), then graduating to the more respectable Capital Radio, he went national in 1994 as original host of the Radio 1 Rap Show. \nWestwood is an unusual sort of national treasure H e launched his shiny new BBC vehicle with a Hammersmith Palais gig headlined by those twin East Coast titans, Puff Daddy and Notorious BIG \u2013 the rap megastars of the time. Westwood has long been instrumental in hauling hip-hop talent across the Atlantic. He was the first to bring Ja Rule and Jay Z to London (\u201cWestwood has held me down from day one,\u201d says Jay-Z. \u201cHe\u2019s family \u2013 we've grown up together\u201d). More recently, he helped break Kanye West , Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj and Drake on these shores. \nHe was respectfully name-checked on Nineties cuts by NORE, Pharoahe Monch and Jadakiss \u2013 not to mention thanked on the sleevenotes of Public Enemy\u2019s Fear Of A Black Planet album \u2013 because he was the only British DJ playing hardcore hip-hop on mainstream, legal radio. For any visiting US rap star, a visit to Westwood was virtually compulsory on their itinerary. As Snoop Dogg says: \u201cYou can\u2019t come to the kingdom and not see the prince.\u201d \nA tireless champion of the genre, his zeal is undimmed. Workaholic Westwood has devoted his life to the music he loves. He\u2019s single, childless and lives in a one-bedroom flat. It\u2019s all about the game, baby. He\u2019s married to hip-hop. \nHis much-mocked rambunctious presentational persona was transformed by trips to New York, where he met influential DJs Marley Marl and Mister Cee. Inspired, Westwood changed his own style to \u201cmatch the energy and excitement of the music, shouting and cracking that mic like I\u2019m in a club\u201d.\nHe introduced urban sound effects: gunfire, explosions, klaxons, car horns, police sirens. He created a hanging-at-the-crib vibe in the studio, with musicians\u2019 entourages popping Cristal corks, sipping Hennessy brandy and smoking Cohiba blunts in the background. \nT eeth-rattling \u201cheavy hits\u201d became punctuated by slangy shout-outs and Westwood\u2019s impassioned, much-imitated cries of \u201cNow drop the bomb!\u201d, \u201cAll you other DJs, fall back!\u201d. \u201cGet your hustle on, baby!\u201d, \u201cWe\u2019re going in strong!\u201d, \u201cWe\u2019re built for that!\u201d \u201dTake it down south!\u201d, \u201cBow down and kiss the ring!\u201d or \u201cUnderstand that!\u201d \nWestwood\u2019s got more catchphrases than a gameshow host, a crucial factor in building his instant recognition factor and unmistakable brand. As he recently explained: \u201cWith some household-name DJs, what\u2019s their fly s--- that people say back to them? You\u2019d struggle to name anything. But when I\u2019m out on the road and people say, \u2018Yo, we\u2019re going in, baby!\u2019 or \u2018Drop the bomb!\u2019\u2026 it\u2019s like you\u2019re winning, fam. Winning.\u201d\nIn 1999, the gangsta rap lyrics he loves became all too real when Westwood was the target of a drive-by shooting. Gunmen on a motorbike pulled up alongside his Range Rover in South London and opened fire. \n\u201cA bullet went through the back of my seat an inch from my spine,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnother bullet went through my arm and missed the nerves which would have left me paralysed. The guy in the back seat had his kneecap blown off. Am I not blessed? Thank God I\u2019m alive and everyone survived.\u201d We should all be thankful because Westwood is an unusual sort of national treasure. \nH e might be older than their fathers \u2013 in some cases, their grandfathers \u2013 but among urban artists, his DJ peers and hip-hop heads, Westwood remains one of the most respected, best-connected taste-makers out there. The Mobo Awards crowned him Best UK Radio DJ five times. Fittingly, in 2010, the Radio Academy gave him The John Peel Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.\nIn 2013, Westwood left Radio 1 and 1Xtra after an heroic 19-year stint. He returned to Capital Xtra, where he still drops bombs, keeps it mad real, rocks the joint and rips down parties for four hours every Saturday night. \nHis compilation albums have sold two million copies and counting. His production, promotion and events companies, which were way ahead of their time, are thriving.

Here's The Telegraph's handy guide to the retailers who don't embrace the cut-price chaos.\nApple Apple surprised retailers last year by taking part in Black Friday, albeit only for a brief 24-hour window. While in previous years the tech giant rejected the sales event, in 2016 they buckled to the pressure.\nHowever their presence was somewhat underwhelming: they offered a gift card worth up to \u00a3120 with the purchase of certain Apple products (not including their recently-released iPhone 7). Needless to say, the internet was unimpressed.\nSo for Apple's Black Friday sale they're offering gift cards up to $200 on selected products. That's not a sale \ud83d\ude11\n\u2014 Thomas (@DarkHorse_TM) November 24, 2016 All Apple are offering for Black Friday are gift cards when you buy Mac, iPhone, iPad, Watch or Apple TV.\n\nNot worth the refreshes.\n\u2014 Daniel Hart (@KingDingDan) November 25, 2016 W hile Apple hasn't announced yet whether or not they will taking part in the sales weekend this year, we aren't holding our breath for discounted iPhone 8s.\nSelfridges Last year Selfridges officially stayed clear of Black Friday, instead creating their own holiday: Christmas Come Early. \nAs well as offering consumers the discount code 'SELFCCE', this faux-Black Friday sale also included 20 per cent off gifts and 10 per cent off beauty, fragrances, watches and wine.\nKeep your eyes peeled for similarly sneaky behaviour this year; just because a shop claims to be rejecting the sales event it doesn't mean they are.\nIkea Looking for a new bed on the cheap? Prepare to be disappointed. Famous for selling furniture and homeware at low prices throughout the year, Ikea don't feel the need to take part in Black Friday events.\nInsisting their focus is on making affordable furniture available to as many people as possible, they say: \"Low price is the cornerstone of the IKEA vision.\n\"Our ambition is to offer everyday low prices all year round, which is why we don't take part in temporary discounting events.\u201d\nBlack Friday countdown 2017 Homebase L ike Ikea, the DIY superstore has also turned its back on Black Friday, saying it is committed to low price 365 days a year.\nHowever they did take part in 2015, offering 25 per cent off all Christmas decorations, meaning their participation in 2017's bargain bonanza can't be ruled out entirely.\nAsda Asda, the cousin of US shopping giant Wal-Mart, was one of Black Friday\u2019s pioneers in this country. But a series of unseemly stampedes for flat-screen TVs made it clear that Black Friday and supermarkets don\u2019t mix well.\nLast year they snubbed the sales weekend for the second year in a row, initially dropping their 2015 event with the following euphemistic explanation:\n\"Instead of the hustle and bustle and pressure of one or two day sales where customers typically push the boat out on high-value items, this year Asda customers say they\u2019d prefer deals on value-for-money, high-quality products that all the family can enjoy.\"\nPrimark Given that Primark doesn't have an online store it has little need to compete against rivals battling for the best online discounts.\nPrimark has not taken part in any major Black Friday sale thus far because, as a spokesperson for the cut-price retailer told The Telegraph : \u201cPrimark offers great value on the high street every day of the year.\u201d\nGeorge Weston, the chief executive of Primark, was a little less polite, asserting: \"Black Friday in the UK is pointless\".\nNext Like Primark , value clothes retailer Next maintains low profit margins throughout the year, and thus has less to gain than rivals from discounting further.

But what is the bomb intended to achieve?\n\nA ravishing, earthy set, if not quite home turf - Desire Under the Elms, Sheffield Crucible, review The two young jumpy female activists and their much older accomplice, Jose, who are holed up in the flat, are divided. They can\u2019t even decide what to call it \u2013 at times opting for the codeword \u201ccheese\u201d, at others \u201ccow\u201d. The girls, members of an anti capitalist, non violent cell, want to set off the bomb at 3am outside a bank when no one will be around. But Jose, an experienced political activist, has packed it full of nails and is convinced that the only way to make both the morning and the evening news \u2013 in other words, to get heard \u2013 is to start a war.\nDanusia Samal, Aimee-Ffion Edwards and Paul Kaye Credit: Alastair Muir I suspect that this play resonates far more powerfully in Calderon\u2019s native Chile than it is likely to do here. Over the past decade, Chile has experienced a wave of non-lethal bomb attacks, with no single group taking responsibility.\nThat Calderon has written a play about an undetonated bomb that contains barely an ounce of tension tells its own story. Youth protest today, the play argues, is so denuded of coherent ideology and purpose that it has been rendered virtually impotent. Alejandra and Marcela \u2013 both a bit hapless, using jumpers as makeshift balaclavas, and incapable even of spinning a convincing story to their neighbour to cover what they are cooking up in the flat \u2013 want to protest against \u201ceverything\u201d. But Jose is a veteran of direct action. Where is the peasant revolution, he wonders. Where is the hunger for real change?\nDanusia Samal in Guillermo Calderon's play Credit: Alastair Muir C alderon\u2019s stop-start dialogue \u2013 purposefully anaemic a lot of the time \u2013 has shades of Pinter at his most farcical. Pritchard\u2019s production revels in these bland, jerking rhythms in ways that compound Calderon\u2019s satirical swipes at the self-serving arguments of terrorism, but neither play nor production achieve enough momentum to keep you really hooked.\nKing Lear review: Ian McKellen reigns supreme in this triumphant production Implicit in Calderon\u2019s play is a critique of a political system in Chile that offers its youth so little that Alejandra is ambivalent about the prospect of prison \u2013 after all, at least she\u2019d get to see some of her friends. Yet the tone is so persistently ironic and detached that his arguments never fully connect. Pritchard\u2019s production has flashes of nicely judged absurdity and there is a pitch perfect performance from Sarah Niles as the disconcertingly friendly neighbour, Carmen. But rather than worry about a ticking bomb, I found myself mainly checking my watch.\nUntil Oct 21.

Thorne @LIGO . pic.twitter.com/za1GNsAfnE\n\u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 3, 2017 B ut British physicist Ronald Drever, who was a key member of the team, missed out on science's most coveted prize, after losing his battle with dementia earlier this year.\nProfessor James Hough, of the University of Glasgow\u2019s School of Physics and Astronomy, added: \u201cBack in the 1970s, working with Ron Drever we built one of the world\u2019s first gravitational wave detectors, instrumented with piezoelectric transducers, before moving on to designing increasingly sophisticated technology.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to have played a leading role in the conception and expansion of gravitational research Glasgow, and that the efforts of Glasgow researchers over the decades paid off both with the development of LIGO\u2019s mirror-suspension technology, and now exciting roles in delivering the astrophysical results from the brand new field.\u201d\nIn 1915 Einstein announced his General Theory of Relativity which suggested that huge bodies in space, like planets or black holes, have so much mass that they actually bend space and time.\nIt can be thought of as a giant rubber sheet with a bowling ball in the centre. Just as the ball warps the sheet, so a planet bends the fabric of space-time creating the force that we feel as gravity. Any object that comes near to the body falls towards it because of the effect.\nEinstein predicted that if two massive bodies came together it would create such a huge ripple in space time that it should be detectable on Earth.\nMoment scientists reveal major gravitational wave finding 00:40 I n Feburary last year, the Ligo announced they had detected such a ripple, believed to be caused by two black holes colliding. The experiment has since been confirmed and replicated by other observatories.\nProfessor Mark Hannam, from Cardiff University\u2019s School of Physics and Astronomy, said: \u201cLIGO has already given us a string of discoveries - the first direct detection of gravitational waves, the first observation of a binary black hole system, the first observation of black holes several tens of times more massive than the sun, and arguably the first direct observation of a black hole. But the truly incredible achievement was to make the LIGO detectors.\n\"We already knew gravitational waves existed. We already knew black holes existed. What Weiss, Thorne and Barish did was to build the first machine sensitive enough to be able to directly measure gravitational waves.\n\"It took them over forty years, and the result was the most sensitive measuring device ever made. It is an incredible new tool that has only begun to transform our understanding of the universe.\n\"It\u2019s very sad that one of the UK\u2019s gravitational-wave pioneers, Ron Drever, didn\u2019t live to see this fantastic recognition of these ground-breaking discoveries.\n\"However, he was alive to witness the first ever detection of gravitational waves in 2015, and I understand he was extremely thrilled.\u201d\nGerman-born Weiss was awarded half of the 9-million-kronor ($1.1 million) prize amount and Thorne and Barish will split the other half.\nProf Lord Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal & Fellow of Trinity College, University of Cambridge, said: \u201cThe Nobel committee has apportioned credit appropriately among three leaders of the LIGO project - outstanding individuals whose contributions were distinctive and complementary.\n\"Weiss deserves prime credit for devising (along with the late Ron Drever) the amazingly precise laser techniques.

The car industry was like Silicon Valley is today, selling products that offer a view into a previously unimaginable future, allowing the consumer to see far beyond the limits of his home town.\nThe car was full of the latest technology Credit: Erik Fuller G eneral Motors was then the largest company in the world and throughout the 1950s it led the charge with a series of glitzy roadshows called Motorama, where it would show off all the latest Cadillacs, Buicks and Oldsmobiles, along with fancy prototypes and concept cars. In keeping with the industry\u2019s position as a tech leader, GM did not limit itself to cars, but had fashion shows produced by the company\u2019s own design team, and screened slick movies showing fully automated kitchens of the future.\nThe Oldsmobile pictured here is a rarity \u2013 a show car created for the 1953 Motorama that was actually made available to the public, albeit in limited numbers. The Ninety-Eight Fiesta had all the latest innovations beneath its two-tone paint job, including a wraparound windscreen, spinning wheel covers, as well as power steering, power brakes and power windows \u2013 it even had a power seat, in 1953.\nIts striking two-tone paint job Credit: Erik Fuller A new car launch in the car in the 1950s could create the same buzz as a new iPhone being unveiled today. But watching a striking new car like this being paraded along a catwalk cannot be compared to the sight of a middle-aged pluto-nerd holding up a phone that looks suspiciously like the one he showed us last time. This car is a reminder not just of a golden age of motoring, but of a golden age full-stop. This was a time when you could get into a car and drive into the future, rather than watch it on a little screen.\nThe classic car is set for auction through RM Sotheby's Credit: Erik Fuller T he 1953 Oldsmobile Ninety Eight Fiesta is Lot 153 in the RM Sotheby\u2019s Hershey sale in Pennsylvania, USA, on Thursday October 5th.

But to get to it, we must be clear-eyed about the challenges along our way.\n\u201cWe must not downplay the difficulties nor underestimate the complexities. This will be one of the most challenging tasks ever undertaken by a peacetime government but with focus and determination and unity, we will succeed.\u201d\nMr Johnson\u2019s conference speech on Tuesday will be arguably the most anticipated of the conference in \u00adManchester.\nPhilip Hammond and his wife Susan Williams-Walker at the Conservative party conference Credit: Geoff Pugh for the Telegraph T he reception it gets could make or break his ambitions of one day leading his party, and if he is seen as being disloyal it could also increase calls from some of his Cabinet colleagues for Theresa May to sack him.\nMr Hammond did not name Mr Johnson in his speech, but in another barb clearly aimed at him, he said the Government must \u201cpick our way carefully and cautiously across the difficult terrain of EU negotiation, to ensure we arrive in good order on the fertile plains at the other side\u201d, adding that \u201cfocus, determination and unity\u201d would be needed to succeed.\nIn a series of media interviews earlier in the day, Mr Hammond had said that Mr Johnson was \u201csackable\u201d, after the Prime Minister refused to answer a question on Sunday about whether the Foreign Secretary was sackable.\nHe also suggested Mr Johnson\u2019s disloyalty was making it harder for David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, to negotiate in \u00adBrussels.\nHe said: \u201cThe more we can show unity, the stronger our negotiating position with the European Union would be. His hand would be stronger when it is clear that he has a united Cabinet behind him.\u201d\nBoris Johnson arrives at party conference 00:25 A sked about Mr Johnson\u2019s claim that the Brexit transition period should be \u201ctwo years and not a second more\u201d, he shrugged: \u201cI would describe that as a rhetorical flourish.\u201d\nMr Hammond suggested that Mrs May had given Britain \u201cflexibility\u201d over the length of the Brexit transition period by saying it would last \u201caround\u201d two years. Damian Green, the First Secretary of State, said the transition period could last \u201ca few months either side\u201d of two years. The Daily Telegraph understands that several Cabinet ministers believe a period of two and a half years would be acceptable.\nSir Michael Fallon was also scathing when asked about Mr Johnson\u2019s chances of becoming the next Tory leader.\nSpeaking on Chopper\u2019s Brexit Podcast, Sir Michael said his advice to his squabbling colleagues was to \u201chave a look at the military. People admire our military the world over \u2026 Why? Because of \u2026 those virtues of discipline and loyalty\u201d.\nHe said a poll that showed 21 per cent of Tory members wanted Mr Johnson as the next leader \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem extremely high\u201d.\nBoris Johnson went for a jog on the morning of Mr Hammond's speech Credit: Geoff Pugh S peaking on the same programme, the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said Mrs May needed to show by the end of the conference that she could \u201clead a united party, or we will not succeed\u201d.\nNicky Morgan, the former education secretary, said Mr Johnson \u201chad to go\u201d unless he could demonstrate his loyalty within days.\nHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned if Conservative cabinet ministers did not \"pull in behind\" Mrs May they would be \"risking Brexit.\"\nAsked by the Guardian if he feared Mr Johnson was \"looking for the top job,\" Mr Hunt said: \"All I would say to anyone who might be eyeing a different job is that Jeremy Corbyn is also eyeing a different job.\n\"And if they don\u2019t swing behind Theresa, who I think is doing a fantastic job in very difficult circumstances, they will just open the door to Jeremy Corbyn and probably the most dangerous leftwing government this country has ever seen.\"\nSpeaking at a Conservative conference fringe event, Mr Green refused to rule out paying for single market access after the Brexit transition period \u2013 which would cross one of Mr Johnson\u2019s red lines.\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m not ruling anything in or out that will be in the detail of the negotiation because David Davis has got a difficult job and he is eminently suited to doing it.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything that makes his job more difficult.\u201d\nSteve Baker, a Brexit minister, issued a further jibe at Mr Johnson at a conference fringe event, insisting he would not be wading into the \u201cunfortunately public debate\u201d about the nature of a transitional deal.", "highlightText": "",

Many men feel they have to suffer in silence \n\"Just when you think you've heard everything! Bloody man-opause what a croc of s***. Another excuse for men to behave badly.\" \nT his was just one of many livid tweets hurled at me during a recent breakfast TV appearance. As a writer specialising in men's issues, I'd been invited onto the sofa to talk about the andropause (male menopause), alongside one of the most respected hormone specialists in the country. Despite Marion Gluck's assertion that men of a certain age did indeed suffer from menopausal type symptoms, many female viewers remained unconvinced. \n\"Anything we can do men can do it more dramatically\" screeched one angry viewer; \"menopause - is it just like man-flu?\" sneered another. Even autocorrect changes it to menopause so it clearly doesn't exist - manopause #thismorning \u2014 Julie (@mrst43) August 8, 2017 \nB ut why the withering attacks? A blood test carried out by Marion had revealed that my hormone levels were down, resulting in increased levels of anxiety and depression. She prescribed a course of supplements and within a few weeks I had noticed a marked improvement in my mental and physical wellbeing. Hardly controversial. Indeed one of the reasons I agreed to appear on the show was to encourage men to talk more openly about their health concerns. \nThe host of the show, Eamonn Holmes, spoke out against the naysayers . \"I could not sit here and criticise any female condition in that way,\" he argued live on TV \"so it absolutely amazes me that there\u2019s not some sort of empathy or realisation that if it happens to one species of human being, the same has to happen to the other one.\" \nMy social media drubbing was a salient reminder of why so many men feel they have to suffer in silence. The outdated notion that men should remain stiff-upper-lipped at all times continues, with many women seeing ill health as a sign of weakness. A close friend revealed recently that he no longer turns to his wife when illness strikes: \"there's no point, she just rolls her eyes and tells me to man-up\". Another friend told me that his girlfriend had abandoned him when he contracted acute appendicitis: \"I spent several days doubled up in excruciating agony but she barely acknowledged my existence\". James Innes-Smith appeared on This Morning to talk about the manopause \nI know the feeling. While holidaying in Thailand a few years back I suffered a particularly virulent bout of food poisoning. My girlfriend and I were staying in one of those bug-infested beach huts with a hole in the floor for a loo and a rusty outside tap. Instead of standing by her man through fevered babblings and frequent visits to the unsanitary hole, the light-of-my-life left me to stew in my own filth while she took in the delights of Koh Phi Phi. Apparently I'd been \"over-dramatic\", but how else are you supposed to projectile vomit? \nAt this time of year many of us will have the \"over-dramatic\" label thrown at us. Understand that when a woman accuses you of having man-flu what she's really saying is \"you have a mild case of the sniffles, get over it and don\u2019t expect any brow-mopping from me.\" \nApparently men will never know the true meaning of pain until we learn to give birth. But according to research men are more susceptible to certain kinds of pain. For two years Dr. Andreas Sander-Kiesling from the department of anaesthesiology and intensive care at the Medical University of Graz in Austria assessed the records of over 10,000 patients undergoing a variety of surgeries. They were asked to rate their pain levels within 24 hours of procedures. Men were 27pc more likely to report feeling more pain after major invasive operations such as heart surgery, while women showed higher pain readings after more routine operations such as biopsies. \nSo it turns out we're not all a bunch of needy weaklings. Okay, we may occasionally exaggerate our symptoms for dramatic effect, adding a phlegmy hawk here, a pitiful moan there \u2013 but who doesn\u2019t relish being cosseted by a concerned lover every now and then? \nLadies, next time your man is feeling under the weather, don\u2019t just shake your head in disbelief. He may be feeling under loved or under appreciated; he may just be looking for a little reassurance and a kind word; or, God forbid, he might even be going through something major like the manopause. Give him the benefit of the doubt, mop his brow, be the bearer of comforting Lemsip, tell him he'll feel better in the morning. And if his symptoms persist, take him kicking and screaming down to the nearest GP surgery. \nAfter all, what goes around comes around.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marion gluck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eamonn holmes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james innes-smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andreas sander-kiesling", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lemsip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medical university of graz", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koh phi phi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:43:13.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c94a2eb7f06dba73028470a10b34905c4f9a719e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROXzNkIHJ1sm_rVOdAAGRwXyemR3OL1e9EFb_Bdn7boYlJZdXeZgH4D1qyfCkZsmltjzh9bJuhLB0_0EITtFbF4bWcUaGxUG31ix8Hq5z8vnmXqsponeC.j4IsrKNwaeaYw--", "site_full": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "site": "telegraph.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "www.telegraph.co.uk for the latest news from the UK and around the world.", "title": "Bland cocktail bars are out, speakeasies, microbars and gin joints are in", "title_full": "Bland cocktail bars are out, speakeasies, microbars and gin joints are in", "published": "2017-10-03T13:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/food-and-drink/2017/10/03/drifter-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq3U9-D5U2JffhMhmF-FT3hm8HY4ZFrniSXaLtLcTAUTE.JPG", "performance_score": 6, "domain_rank": 317, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 605, "comments": 0, "shares": 605}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c94a2eb7f06dba73028470a10b34905c4f9a719e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROXzNkIHJ1sm_rVOdAAGRwXyemR3OL1e9EFb_Bdn7boYlJZdXeZgH4D1qyfCkZsmltjzh9bJuhLB0_0EITtFbF4bWcUaGxUG31ix8Hq5z8vnmXqsponeC.j4IsrKNwaeaYw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Neil Ridley", "published": "2017-10-03T13:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bland cocktail bars are out, speakeasies, microbars and gin joints are in", "text": "Neil Ridley 3 October 2017 \u2022 11:41am \nD rinks writers Joel Harrison and Neil Ridley have visited a LOT of bars.

Read on for their global bar tips. \nThe best speakeasy: The Drifter, Chicago \nIt\u2019s not been long since this bar was discovered, in the literal sense, when an old man punched a hole in the basement wall of The Green Door Tavern with his stick. It turns out that behind the door was a Prohibition-era burlesque bar completely intact, bottles still behind the bar; the hand-painted burlesque posters still hanging; the stage in place; a few dirty glasses on the bar. It had sat unmoved, untouched, undiscovered when they found it. They fixed it up slightly and brought in burlesque acts that fit the room. You walk into a time warp. \nThe best historic Bar: El Floridita, Havana Daiquiris lined up on the bar at El Floridita in Havana Credit: Wolfi Poelzer / Alamy Stock Photo \nE l Floridita may well be a hugely popular tourist destination, but it remains a fine example of how important the daiquiri is to Cuban culture. Here, they\u2019re largely served frozen, by gentlemen in red bar-tending jackets, while in the background a laid-back band of Cuban musicians lays down the perfect drinking soundtrack. It sounds as corny as can be, but it\u2019s not. \nThe best hotel bar: The Connaught Bar, London Agostino \u201cAgo\u201d Perrone \nU ndoubtedly, one of the most highly regarded destination bars in London, The Connaught Bar in Mayfair, headed up by the charismatic Agostino \u201cAgo\u201d Perrone and his team, seems to land awards on a never-ending basis for its style, service and cocktails. \nThe Connaught has always trod a perfectly balanced line between inspiration and reinvention of the classics, as well as staying abreast of the most modern trends and steering away from the gimmickry that has consumed a few of its competitors.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:43:14.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf9f273731b6ba031189f43476952eb1cf8b129a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRwKYlGfxqeVGRKUQAogs48Hn1vdRyisM1bF5bTMpDxAXT1tZUoxcoYdF5pJTyxFiIw1VAzbq2gyPNV4kSEPkYN", "site_full": "jobs.telegraph.co.uk", "site": "telegraph.co.uk", "site_section": "http://jobs.telegraph.co.uk//jobsrss/", "site_categories": ["job_search", "jobs"], "section_title": "Job Search RSS", "title": "Barnaby Stewart Executive Search: Regional Director RDc/159/05", "title_full": "Barnaby Stewart Executive Search: Regional Director RDc/159/05", "published": "2017-10-03T15:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://du231s836adgi.cloudfront.net", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 317, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bf9f273731b6ba031189f43476952eb1cf8b129a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRwKYlGfxqeVGRKUQAogs48Hn1vdRyisM1bF5bTMpDxAXT1tZUoxcoYdF5pJTyxFiIw1VAzbq2gyPNV4kSEPkYN", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Barnaby Stewart Executive Search: Regional Director RDc/159/05", "text": "Our client is a leading multi-disciplined main contractor with a reputation for project delivery and innovation.

And should we thank her? The Telegraph 5 days ago By Adam White \u00a9 Provided by The Telegraph Sex and the City was a lot of things: a romantic soap, a riotously entertaining ode to female friendship, and a capitalist cesspit of designer handbags and luxury New York apartments. But it was never exactly a mystery drama \u2013 until, that is, the recent question mark that is the lengthily-gestating Sex and the City 3. Despite even the weariest of tabloid gossip hounds having grown tired of speculating over the film\u2019s existence, a story emerged on September 29 claiming that the new movie was due to start shooting in New York within weeks. Only for dastardly cartoon supervillain Kim Cattrall to put the kibosh on it due to her \u201coutrageous demands.\u201d A source, who may or may not have been Cattrall\u2019s long-rumoured rival Sarah Jessica Parker in a wig and a trenchcoat, told MailOnline that \u201ceveryone was looking forward to making this movie but Kim made it all about her, always playing the victim. Kim had the audacity to tell Warner Bros that she would only do this if they made other movies she had in development. Ridiculous. Who does she think she is \u2013 George Clooney?\u201d \u00a9 Provided by The Telegraph \u201cThis franchise made her and let\u2019s be frank, it\u2019s all she is really known for,\u201d claimed another source. \u201cCast and crew don\u2019t just show up to make a movie, they have to rearrange their lives. People turned down other jobs, were in the process of relocating to New York but she kept stalling and was always unavailable when answers from her were needed.\u201d The story emerged a day after Parker revealed on the red carpet that the film was dead. She told Extra : \u201cIt\u2019s over\u2026 we\u2019re not doing it. I\u2019m disappointed. We had this beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story. It\u2019s not just disappointing that we don\u2019t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie.\u201d Cattrall, presumably woken from her slumber by a concerned publicist, tweeted the following day that she was aware of the \u201cs---storm\u201d, and claimed that \u201cthe only demand [she] ever made was that [she] didn\u2019t want to do a third film\u2026 and that was back in 2016.\u201d She also responded graciously to several fans supporting her decision to not reprise her role as randy pun-machine Samantha Jones. Woke 2 a @MailOnline \ud83d\udca9storm! The only 'DEMAND' I ever made was that I didn't want to do a 3rd film....& that was back in 2016 \u2014 Kim Cattrall (@KimCattrall) September 29, 2017 And despite the initial outrage over Cattrall\u2019s apparent betrayal of the franchise, fans seemed to quickly remember that the last Sex and the City movie, released in 2010, was generally hideous. A garish sojourn to the Middle East with a Liza Minnelli cameo and ghoulish Abu Dhabi jokes (\u201cHe\u2019s Lawrence of my labia!\u201d), the film was dubbed by Mark Kermode a \u201cfoul, soul-sucking, horrible vacuum of vile emptiness.\u201d Cattrall seemed to agree, replying with a \u201cPreach\u201d to a fan who tweeted: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t owe fans a third movie. The second was terrible as it was.\u201d The actress also shared a Daily Mail story with a headline reading \u201cFans support Kim Cattrall\u2019s call to not make a Sex and the City sequel\u201d, Cattrall adding, \u201cWhat a difference a day makes.\u201d A post shared by iamkristindavis (@iamkristindavis) on Sep 29, 2017 at 11:06am PDT Despite that, Kristin Davis, who played prissy Charlotte York on the show, has been vocal about her upset. She wrote on Instagram : \u201cI wish that we could have made the final chapter, on our own terms, to complete the stories of our characters. It is deeply frustrating not to able to share that chapter (beautifully written by [executive producer] Michael Patrick King) with all of you.\u201d \u00a9 Provided by The Telegraph While Cattrall has insisted she didn\u2019t make unreasonable demands, her costars have yet to jump to her defense. Even stranger, a story emerged in Page Six of the New York Post this week claiming the film was due to start shooting today in Manhattan, if only for Cattrall\u2019s last-minute backing out. \u201cPeople were expecting to go to work, it\u2019s true,\u201d a source said. \u201cThey were supposed to start shooting [on Tuesday]. Kim [Cattrall] was negotiating and was asking for things the studio wouldn\u2019t go for, so they pulled the plug.\u201d \u00a9 Provided by The Telegraph But while anonymous sources have tried their hardest to paint Cattrall as a movie-ruiner, it\u2019s difficult not to feel sympathy for her enjoyably unapologetic shrug to the whole enterprise. Particularly in light of a film franchise that felt so often like an unnecessary add-on to a series that already had a perfectly neat ending. As a result, Davis speaking so passionately about fans missing out on a \u201cfinal chapter\u201d seems particularly disingenuous. Likewise the idea that Warner Bros would allegedly set up a shooting schedule and hire crews before Cattrall had even signed on\u2026 an unlikely (or at least short-sighted) move for a project so dependent on its quartet of leads. Their willingness to pull the plug additionally doesn\u2019t make this third movie sound all that promising in the first place. And if a major studio didn\u2019t enormously care if Carrie Bradshaw and Co. slipped on their heels for yet another round of cocktails and puns, why should we?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kim cattrall", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cattrall", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "liza minnelli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim [cattrall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carrie bradshaw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristin davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark kermode", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samantha jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu dhabi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael patrick king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "co.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warner bros", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:43:16.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fb4602bcaec57c74dc4c9ddeb925be0e55a43208", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROXzNkIHJ1sm_L4JJt7HtK5m1EHOJB3UVFec0rHa4WnbHWBe3HtwKcC3GKwb1K6W64NXbnAYfCo23Ujou2DcSBYqMRcEcGBkxA.JRcQQe4RVwQ6gQN46obD4oM8BdP2.SNQ--", "site_full": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "site": "telegraph.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "www.telegraph.co.uk for the latest news from the UK and around the world.", "title": "Andrew House, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO and President, is stepping down", "title_full": "Andrew House, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO and President, is stepping down", "published": "2017-10-03T13:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2016/09/07/27081997_Sony_Launches_PlayStation_4_In_Japan_As_Console_Retakes_US_Retail_Lead_Over_Microsoft27s_Xbo-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqHfup94T--9X8LHEVXNACM0VDYkfsXSKnQkWz-thKuYc.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 317, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fb4602bcaec57c74dc4c9ddeb925be0e55a43208", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROXzNkIHJ1sm_L4JJt7HtK5m1EHOJB3UVFec0rHa4WnbHWBe3HtwKcC3GKwb1K6W64NXbnAYfCo23Ujou2DcSBYqMRcEcGBkxA.JRcQQe4RVwQ6gQN46obD4oM8BdP2.SNQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hannah Dwan", "published": "2017-10-03T13:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Andrew House, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO and President, is stepping down", "text": "H aving worked at Sony Interactive Entertainment for 27 years, with the last 6 being as President and Global CEO, Andrew House is stepping down from his role.

PlayStation has been a huge part of my life for more than 20 years but with the business having achieved record-breaking success, now seemed to be the right time for me to pursue new challenges. I shall always treasure the friendships and people that have made SIE such a wonderful place to work.

announced, in a bid to crack down on the \"revolting\" trend of acid attacks on members of the public. \nIn a speech to the Conservative party conference in Manchester the Home Secretary vowed to do more to curb the sale of sulphuric acid, used in the production of so-called \"mother of Satan\" homemade explosives . \nShe also announced a crackdown on terror and illegal content online, designed to curb attacks and prevent children being groomed by sex attackers. \nBritain's Home Secretary Amber Rudd Credit: AFP/BEN STANSALL A n acid attack victim has welcomed Amber Rudd's crack-down on acid attacks.\nResham Khan, 21, who faced life-changing injuries after a stranger hurled acid into her car as she celebrated her birthday, has been campaigning for tougher laws on acid, with a change.org petition she spearheaded garnering over a 350,000 signatures.\nShe said: \"I welcome the announcement by Amber Rudd. It is somewhat reassuring to see the government acknowledge the true extent of the devastation and pain acid attacks inflict on its victims and their families, both psychologically and physically. Because of this, and the sheer fear and life-changing injuries acid can cause, I do hope this is the start of much more being done to prevent these attacks, punish the perpetrators and support the victims.\"\nM s Khan, who was terrified to leave the house after her ordeal because of the scars inflicted on her, said the proposals to ban carrying acid in public without \u2018good reason\u2019 are \"encouraging\", explaining: \"I hope these verbal remarks can be acted upon swiftly to become legislation. This hand in hand with Amber Rudd's decision to \u2018drastically limit the public sale of sulphuric acid\u2019 reassures me that this issue is being tackled. Banning the sale of acid to those under the age of 18 might be something we all at one time imagined was already in place but to its surprise, it wasn\u2019t. \nResham Khan faced an acid attack on her 21st birthday Credit: Resham Khan \"Deregulation can and is having negative effects on society and we must ensure that there is sufficient regulation when it comes to dealing with acid attacks.\"\n\"I hope the continued coverage, the constant awareness and the seriousness of such horrific crimes are noted by all and that we continue to play our part in society to end such repugnant practices. We cannot let the issue of acid attacks be forgotten and we will continue to push the government, local councils, local representatives and other influential members of the society to use their influence in tackling this Victorian-era practice.\n\"I will never forget the life changing events of my 21st birthday. Every unfortunate victim of acid attacks will always reflect on such traumatic experiences. I started this to make a change, and I continued because people of all ages were confiding in me. It is unacceptable in this day and age to be fearful of such attacks and I hope the people of the U.K don\u2019t live their lives in fear. We want to be free. We want to walk freely on the streets without the threat of someone spraying acid or any other harmful corrosive substances.\"\nI t came as Ms Rudd demanded internet giants \"honour their moral obligations\" and do more to remove terror and indecent sexual images from the internet to prevent people becoming radicalised or children being abused. \nEarlier this year the Government announced it was looking at ways to stop acid attacks which have been particularly prevalent in London where gangs of criminals on mopeds have been targeting pedestrians at random. \nMs Rudd said: \"Acid attacks are absolutely revolting. You have all seen the pictures of victims that never fully recover.\nSchoolgirl scarred in an acid attack after falling out with her friend 06:34 \n\"Endless surgeries. Lives ruined. So today, I am also announcing a new offence to prevent the sale of acids to under 18s. \n\"Furthermore, given its use in the production of so-called \u2018mother of Satan\u2019 homemade explosives, I also announce my intention to drastically limit the public sale of sulphuric acid.\"\nS he added that she will introduce a new violent crime strategy next year which will include measures to ban children from buying knives online and stop people carrying acid in public unless they have a good reason for transporting it. \nEmergency response following acid attack on the junction of Hackney Road Credit: REUTERS P raising the efforts of the Police and other emergency services, Ms Rudd also called on internet companies to do more to tackle terrorism. \nAlthough five plots were carried out in the UK this year another seven were blocked, she said, adding that the intelligence services have noted a shift towards \"crude\" attacks using home-made weapons, rather than complex plots. \nIn a bid to stop being being radicalised online she announced plans which could see anyone who repeatedly watches terror material online imprisoned for up to 15 years. \nacid attack arrest I t ends a disparity which currently means only those who download or store such material are subject to the law. \nAnd she demanded internet giants do more to stop terrorist content being shared and stored online. \n\"In the aftermath of the Westminster Bridge attack, I called the internet companies together.

Sir Edward Heath aboard his sailing yach Morning Cloud \nI n total more than 40 allegations were examined by Wiltshire Police, including claims that abuse took place when the former Prime Minister was sailing around Guernsey and Jersey. \nBut former members of the Morning Cloud crew insist Sir Edward never took the yacht to the Channel Islands. \nNick allegedly told police he recalled being taken to the south coast when he was a youngster and spirited aboard a sailing boat moored at a marina in Southampton. \nHe claimed he was then sexually assaulted by a man he later identified as Sir Edward Heath. Wiltshire Police will publish its report into Heath later this week \nA source close to the investigation said police initially took the complaint seriously because Nick described seeing a cooking stove on board Morning Cloud, which tilted when the vessel bobbed around on the water. \nBut after crew members, who sailed with Sir Edward, were interviewed by detectives, the allegation was discounted. \nThose who sailed in Sir Edward's racing team were quick to point out that tilting cooking stoves were found on virtually all sailing yachts and so did not provide conclusive evidence that Nick was ever aboard Morning Cloud. \nThey were also dismissive of the suggestions that Sir Edward abused youngsters in the Channel Islands. \nMark Dowland, who sailed with him for many years said: \u201cI don\u2019t recall Sir Edward ever being in Jersey or Guernsey with Morning Cloud. We would take part in a race each year from Portsmouth to St Malo. But once we were there he would always fly back. The rest of the crew would sail back with our wives or girlfriends and stop of for a meal in St Helier. I don\u2019t recall Sir Edward ever being with us on that leg of the journey and he simply did not have the ability to take the boat out on his own.\u201d Sir Edward Heath died in 2005 \nN ick\u2019s allegations about Sir Edward and about her so called VIP abusers, were subsequently passed to Northumbria Police, which conducted a ten month investigation. \nHe falsely told police he and other children had been raped, abused and even murdered by a powerful group of individuals including Lord Bramall, the former head of the army and Leon Brittan, the former Home Secretary. \nAt one point he also claimed former Tory MP, Harvey Proctor, attempted to maim him with a penknife, only to be prevented by Sir Edward, who was another of the abusers. \nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is currently assessing a file of evidence on the case before deciding whether to charge Nick with perverting the course of justice. \nHe could also face charges of fraud after it was alleged that he received compensation for the abuse he claimed to have suffered.

Lord Holick branded Hinkley a \u201cgood example of bad policy\u201d and warned the Government that it was time to consider a plan B.\nA source close to EDF Energy, also at the party conference, said the company had been clear that it is willing to engage with Government to create a new pricing model for its future projects at Sizewell and Bradwell.\nThe high cost of new nuclear is in part due to the heavy risk and \u00a320bn investment required upfront to build the plant, but critics say Government could reduce these costs by taking an active stake in the project.\nHinkley Point nuclear plant: the story so far E arlier this year Tim Yeo, a former environment minister and energy committee chairman, wrote to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State, warning that the only way the Government can avert a crisis for the country\u2019s nuclear programme is to take a direct financial stake in the projects.\nHe suggested that Government should offer loans to developers that can be paid back once the plant comes on stream, or take an equity stake in the project, which could be sold off to investors when construction is complete.\nThe UK is banking on the 3.2GW nuclear power plant to provide as much as 7pc of the country\u2019s energy by the middle of next decade. However the Hinkley Point, Moorside and Sizewell B projects have all been dogged by delays and concerns over whether the multi-billion pound investments can be shouldered by the companies.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "greg clarke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bradwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim yeo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard harrington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hinkley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national audit office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of lords", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "business and energy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sizewell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conservative party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edf energy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hinkley point", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:31:08.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fcde2b0cbc0741182963c1ce8deaf593136c121b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROXzNkIHJ1sm_wTp3oGAOvPHODFceHgoSgqorAHWnjSgwazjf9re6IwUDFUYF7gaumJc2bFrd8tTxwgFucNR7uY0-", "site_full": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "site": "telegraph.co.uk", "site_section": "http://news.google.com/news?cf=all&ned=uk&hl=en&output=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Top Stories - Google News", "title": "Tom Petty: his 10 best songs - Telegraph.co.uk", "title_full": "Tom Petty: his 10 best songs - Telegraph.co.uk", "published": "2017-10-03T14:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/music/2017/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000142558493-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqcyBDAtXyyWlu10n0nnKeArFYN2SpqxzzJmvEELqLdk8.jpeg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 317, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 185, "comments": 0, "shares": 185}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fcde2b0cbc0741182963c1ce8deaf593136c121b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROXzNkIHJ1sm_wTp3oGAOvPHODFceHgoSgqorAHWnjSgwazjf9re6IwUDFUYF7gaumJc2bFrd8tTxwgFucNR7uY0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T14:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tom Petty: his 10 best songs - Telegraph.co.uk", "text": "Neil McCormick , Music Critic 3 October 2017 \u2022 12:45pm \nT om Petty has died, aged 66 . To celebrate his life, Telegraph music critic Neil McCormick selects the rock legend's 10 greatest tracks \nTom Petty was a songwriter\u2019s songwriter and a rock star\u2019s rock star. His work was sleek and economical, framed in traditional verse chorus structures, but always carrying within it surprising twists, and sketching narratives with hidden depths. Backed by the Heartbreakers, he could deliver those songs with real power and dynamic reach. His love of music was apparent in everything he did. He carried himself with grace, style and a humility that charmed his heroes, his contemporaries and his fans . Petty made thirteen albums with the Heartbreakers, three solo albums, two with supergroup The Traveling Wilburys and two with his old high-school side band Mudcrutch. That\u2019s a lot of music and it is all worth listening to. Here\u2019s my personal selection of ten of the very best. 1.Breakdown \n(from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, 1976) \nT his slinky, soulful groove is how Tom Petty announced himself to the world, his debut single with the Heartbreakers in 1976. And it is utterly compelling. There is a marked restraint about it. This is not the kind of charged, swaggering rock many eventually came to associate with Petty. It\u2019s a taut, smart, constrained song of desire and possession, with just a tang of darkness underneath that suits the nasal tones that lent his vocals a permanent sneer. The rhythm section is controlled and spacious, the groove pulses with electric piano and answering guitar licks, whilst backing vocals sigh and shriek, all creating a sinister atmosphere for a song of devotion. This is American rock and roll with a perfect new wave sensibility. And, like all Tom Petty songs, it has a great opening line that immediately draws you into the narrative: \u201cIt\u2019s all right if you love me, it\u2019s all right if you don\u2019t\u2026\u201d 2.American Girl \n(from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, 1976) \nT he first great Petty anthem, it charges out of the speakers at a fantastic clip in a whirl of guitars and that stunning opening line: \u201cWell, she was an American girl, raised on promises\u2026\u201d You know at once that is celebrating a lost ideal. The chorus is the kind of thing you just have to raise your arms and yell along to: \u201cOh yeah, all right, take it easy baby, make it last all night \u2026 she was an American Girl!\u201d The typically compelling instrumental break avoids the obvious by dropping down low and sleazy before building slowly back up to a racy guitar solo. Oh yeah. All right. 3. I Need To Know \n(from You\u2019re Gonna Get It, 1978) \n\u201cWell the talk on the streets says you might go solo\u2026\u201d This fantastic little rocker is fired with desperate urgency. It opens with a big chord as if in the band is already in full flight. It\u2019s as punchy as a punk rock song, yet with all the musicality of the kind of streamlined harmonic California rock that punks hated, as if the Eagles had found a point of contact with The Clash and The Jam. The chorus, with its echoed, repeated phrase is hair-raisingly thrilling: \u201cI need to know (I need to know) / If you think you\u2019re gonna leave then you better say so.\u201d Petty lets out a scream before an old fashioned rock\u2019n\u2019roll solo from Mike Campbell. Put the man out of his misery. He really needs to know. 4.Refugee \n(From Damn The Torpedoes, 1979) \nA short, perfect drum roll from Stan Lynch launches a huge swirl of organ and guitar. It is a fantastic opening to a dark, highly charged anthem, in which Petty sounds like he is trying to drag a lost friend or lover out of self-defeating torpor. It is full of great lines: \u201cSomewhere, somehow somebody must have kicked you around some / Tell me why you wanna lay there and revel in your abandon?\u201d When he sneers \u201cit don\u2019t really matter to me\u201d, the implication is exactly the opposite. His blood is boiling as he pleads \u201cYou don\u2019t have to live like a refugee\u201d (and the band is on hand with an echoed answering vocal). It is a song that builds to a huge climax, dragging you into a maelstrom conjured up by Benmont Tench\u2019s rich organ and Mike Campbell\u2019s burning lead. 5. A Woman In Love (It\u2019s Not Me) \n(From Hard Promises, 1981) \nA blast of high spiralling guitars drop to a surprisingly slow drag. \u201cShe laughed in my face, told me goodbye / Said \u2018Don\u2019t think about it, you can go crazy'\u201d, sings Petty. When it comes to pulling you into his story from the very first moment, Petty was the absolute master. The chorus blasts off in what could be an uplifting, anthemic cry (\u201cShe\u2019s a woman in love!\u201d), before it drops right down to the killer blow: \u201cBut it\u2019s not me!\u201d The way the song switches dynamically between intense rock and tender, restrained intimacy is extraordinary. The colloquial manner in which Petty sings \u201cWell, all right\u201d as he kicks off the second verse is devastating, like a broken man in a bar telling anyone who will listen his sad story. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the world today / I don\u2019t understand what she needed / I gave her everything, she threw it all away on nothing.\u201d 6. Stop Draggin\u2019 My Heart Around (with Stevie Nicks) \n(from Stevie Nicks: Bella Donna, 1981) \nP etty played with just about every great American star of the classic rock era that you can think of, from Bob Dylan to Bruce Springsteen . But he had a special rapport with Stevie Nicks , the wild gypsy heart of Fleetwood Mac. This was her first solo single, written especially for her by Petty and Mike Campbell. The florid style of Nicks was a perfect counterweight to Petty\u2019s economy and restraint, and their voices entwined beautifully. Stop Draggin\u2019 My Heart Around is a tough little rocker, pleading and threatening at the same time. Nicks and Petty played it in Hyde Park last summer , in what has turned out to be Petty\u2019s last British concert. \u201cYou know that Tom Petty is my favourite rock star!\u201d Nicks shouted out. After their duet, she said she would remember this night \u201cfor the rest of my life.\u201d As will everyone lucky enough to be there. 7. You Got Lucky \n(from Long After Dark, 1982) \nA very wonky, barely in tune synth plays over a slow, stuttering rhythm in this gorgeous, bittersweet kiss-off. It is an unusual little song that drags along, the melody spilling across the rhythm and binding it together. Petty is trying to persuade a lover not to leave him with a combination of threats and pleading, his sneer barely disguising the aura of emotional fragility. It may not be pretty but it is a perfect summation of a side of human relationships most people will have experienced at one time or another. \u201cYou got lucky, babe\u2026\u201d Petty insists, \u201cwhen I found you.\u201d This is a relationship that is not going to end well, the fragility summed up by Mike Campbell\u2019s wobbly, tremolo guitar solo. 8. Don\u2019t Come Around Here No More \n(from Southern Accents, 1985) \nP etty struck up what seemed an unlikely (at the time) alliance with Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics, bringing synthesisers and drum machines into his sleek old school American rock and roll palette. It worked surprisingly well, resulting in this off beat Eighties pop classic, a shuddering intense goodbye song, decorated with Beatles-y sitars. \u201cI\u2019m giving up,\u201d Petty laments, and female backing vocalists snap \u201cStop!\u201d Then right at the end, the Heartbreakers launch into full guitar charge as Petty begs his unwanted suitor to leave him alone. The blend of electropop and Americana has never sounded so perfect. 9. Southern Accents \n(from Southern Accents, 1985) \nT his has long been a personal favourite of mine, a stately piano and strings ballad in which Petty proclaims his affinity to his Florida state roots. \u201cThere\u2019s a southern accent where I come from / The young \u2018uns call it country, the Yankees call it dumb.\u201d There are some very fine details, as always, sketching in the character of the narrator: \u201cNow that drunk tank in Atlanta\u2019s / Just a motel room to me\u201d. And a moment of escape into a yearning bridge reveals, as so often with Petty, the hurt and heartbreak hiding behind the narrative: \u201cFor just a minute there, I was dreaming / For just a minute there it was all so real / For just a minute she was standing there, with me.\u201d Beautiful. 10. Free Fallin\u2019 \n(from Full Moon Fever, 1989) \nM ost of Petty\u2019s great work was done with the Heartbreakers, but in 1989 he made a solo album that turned out to be his most successful ever. Working with ELO\u2019s Jeff Lynne (his friend and collaborator from The Traveling Wilburys), the album has a cleaner, simpler sound than Petty usually conjured with his band. The songs are all perfect little vignettes of American life. Won\u2019t Back Down became his ultimate anthem, a karaoke monster of defiance. But this little beauty is the heart of the album, sketching the disconnected lives of young lovers and broken relationships, name-checking Hollywood streets, conjuring up that space between intent and purpose, action and consequence, as his narrator relinquishes responsibility for a heartbreak as if freefalling through his own life. The cascade of acoustic guitars and backing vocals create a mood of slow-motion dreaminess. It is a song that perfectly evokes the Hollywood unreality of driving through LA, top down, stereo on, a momentary escape from the pressures of real life.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "neil mccormick", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tom petty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stan lynch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob dylan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bella donna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff lynne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benmont tench", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave stewart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bruce springsteen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "said", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stevie nicks", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "petty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eagles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fleetwood mac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eurythmics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yankees", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyde park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:31:09.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d988f57f650d7ea136174c3b8ea1aec64d51ad44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROXzNkIHJ1sm_PMmEjfl6y7L.IRAWLaUW58AdD5u4XHaxLVKBlb8Lr4cljfN7mVYKkNk2CPztkHhOmF_HHyZTnaf.6_rT_NTSaDhye.w4RUzv60aEKF8OS2gnVFnvXZNHzQ--", "site_full": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "site": "telegraph.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Fashion", "title": "'I\u2019m really not into age defining how you dress': Alexander Wang on making your own style rules", "title_full": "'I\u2019m really not into age defining how you dress': Alexander Wang on making your own style rules", "published": "2017-10-03T15:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/fashion/2017/10/03/GettyImages-675700424-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqQLksW6RPhP-QMgKAWPA4vgjloM-nKFxgpjgZJVWE6Nk.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 317, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 9, "comments": 0, "shares": 9}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d988f57f650d7ea136174c3b8ea1aec64d51ad44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROXzNkIHJ1sm_PMmEjfl6y7L.IRAWLaUW58AdD5u4XHaxLVKBlb8Lr4cljfN7mVYKkNk2CPztkHhOmF_HHyZTnaf.6_rT_NTSaDhye.w4RUzv60aEKF8OS2gnVFnvXZNHzQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Caroline Leaper", "published": "2017-10-03T15:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "'I\u2019m really not into age defining how you dress': Alexander Wang on making your own style rules", "text": "Alexander Wang with supermodel Bella Hadid at the Met Gala this year Credit: Getty Caroline Leaper , fashion news and features editor 3 October 2017 \u2022 1:08pm \nD espite being widely credited with the popularisation of the \u2018athleisure\u2019 trend as we know it, designer Alexander Wang says he isn\u2019t exactly fond of the term. \u201cI hate to use that word!\u201d he laughs, acknowledging that the market for said styles has exploded in the last few years under his influence, \u201cbut it\u2019s a word that everyone now has an immediate connection to.\u201d \nWang celebrates 12 years in business this year, a career that has seen him consistently push the boundaries of what we consider to be high fashion, bringing streetwear and sportswear into the luxury lexicon, and making his catwalk shows into democratic, public experiences. Wang has 3.6million Instagram followers and is now one of fashion\u2019s most recognisable faces - and haircuts. \n\u201cSportswear has always been so deeply rooted in my work, and how I personally dress,\u201d he considers. \u201cI obviously didn\u2019t invent streetwear so I can\u2019t take credit for the whole movement, but it has been incredible to see the blow up of athleisure and now we\u2019re seeing sportswear and streetwear really evolve even more.\u201d A post shared by ALEXANDER WANG (@alexanderwangny) on Oct 2, 2017 at 6:07am PDT \n\u201cI\u2019ve always said the most luxurious thing in your closet doesn\u2019t have to be the most expensive. It can be a t-shirt, it can be something that has sentimental value - it\u2019s how you wear it and how you put it together that I find most exciting.\u201d \nW ang, who this week announced that he was stepping down as CEO of his eponymous label, has had the opportunity to push his sportswear design techniques further this year as he has partnered with Adidas Originals for a second collection of experimental clothing and trainers. He\u2019s enlisted Juergen Teller to snap gritty images on the streets of London, capturing the show-off pieces (tracksuit tops that can zip together with a pal\u2019s) as well as the practical ones (slogan tops and new takes on classic three-stripe joggers). \n\u201cI personally always love the more excessive fantasy pieces like the day-glo tracksuits,\u201d he says. \u201cAlso the footwear is so exciting to do because Adidas has so much innovation, especially around their Boost technology.\u201d Juergen Teller photographs the new adidas Originals by Alexander Wang collection Credit: Juergen Teller \n\u201cIt\u2019s never about just slapping our logo on something,\u201d he says of his ethos when it comes to choosing who to collaborate with. \u201cThey have to offer something that we wouldn\u2019t be able to do on our own.\u201d \nA s for what inspires him, Wang says that he\u2019s way more interested in what you or I are wearing than in what a celebrity has been dressed in on the red carpet. \u201cYou can appreciate the red carpet from afar, but how does that relate to your everyday?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty straightforward for someone to get dressed up, but how they are when they\u2019re dressed down and they\u2019re not getting photographed or going out, that\u2019s what I find more inspiring. Those are the times that you\u2019re relaxed, experimental and more undone, and obviously sportswear and streetwear have such a relation to that because that\u2019s how people dress in their day to day lives.\u201d Madonna wearing adidas Originals by Alexander Wang \nW ang is only 33 himself, and many of his greatest fans are the youngest, coolest kids on Instagram. But his designs also appeal to another more sophisticated customer - Madonna, Kristen Wiig, Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman have all been spotted in pieces from his eponymous line, as well as his tenure at the helm of Balenciaga. \n\u201cFor me age is nothing but a number,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m really not into age defining how you dress. Style is a frame of mind, it\u2019s how you want to look at something. I think people are much more into looking after their bodies and being health conscious in today\u2019s world, so fashion really follows that.

Nearly 43 million people, taking into account domestic tourism, visited in 2016. Las Vegas is the US city most dependent on tourism Credit: Getty \nThe city best known for its hedonistic nightlife and gambling culture is, however, top of the table when it comes to its dependency on tourism. No other city in the US has a higher percentage of people employed in the private leisure sector, while Las Vegas is the ninth biggest employer in the hospitality industry as a whole. \nAccording to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitor Bureau, tourism accounts for about 44 per cent of the area\u2019s work force, with more than 250,000 people making a living in hotels, restaurants, bars and casinos, and 100,000 employed in additional services. Not even Orlando, Florida, home to Disney World, has so many of its eggs in one basket. \nIn short, in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in US history , Las Vegas will be keen to ensure there is no lasting impact on the world\u2019s desire to keep visiting. World pays tribute to victims of deadly Las Vegas shooting 01:27 Will the shooting keep tourists away from Las Vegas? \nIt seems unlikely. Las Vegas has seen its visitor numbers increase steadily since 1970, when just 6.8 million people made a pilgrimage to the middle of the Mojave Desert. Growth paused 2008-09 for the recession but has since picked up pace again. Last year\u2019s 43 million was a record. \nYear-to-date figures are currently down 0.9 per cent on last year, but much of the US has this year had to contend with a \u201cTrump Slump\u201d in their arrivals. \nThe second largest mass shooting in US history presents a grim but handy comparison when considering the impact on Las Vegas tourism. Orlando's visitor numbers have not been impacted by the night club shooting Credit: Getty \nLast June Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded nearly 60 when he carried out an attack at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, a city where one in four people is employed in the leisure sector. \nStatistics from Visit Orlando show the attack has not been detrimental to tourism. Orlando as a whole has seen a 3.3 per cent increase in visitors so far this year, compared with 2016, while Orlando Central and South, near where the atrocity took place, have seen 3.3 per cent and 2.6 per cent growth respectively. \n\u201cOrlando's tourism industry experienced widespread growth during the first half of 2017 when compared to the same timeframe last year. The hotel industry saw increases across all key metrics,\u201d said Visit Orlando. \nAnother recent mass shooting was the attack at San Bernardino in California in December 2015, when Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people. In 2016 the Californian city saw a rise in travel spending from $3.7billion to $4.1billion, while the state as a whole celebrated a 1.9 per cent rise in visitor numbers. It expects a further growth of 2.1 in 2017. \nIn its end of year report, the tourist board recognised that it had seen a decline in Mexican arrivals \u201cas a result of tensions between Mexico and the United States\u201d, but makes no mention of the San Bernardino shooting. Does the Foreign Office warn Britons about gun crime in the US? \nStatistics show that the more guns a population has, the more gun deaths there are. \nThe United States ranks 12th in the world for gun deaths, with 10.5 per 100,000 people - only a whisker behind 11th placed Burundi, a war-torn nation to which the US State Department warns against travel - with 10.9 deaths per 100,000 people. According to figures from the UN office on drugs and crime, the US has 88 guns for every 100 people, more than anywhere else in the world. A survey from the Small Arms Survey in 2012 had the figure at 112.6 per 100 people, meaning there is more than one gun for each American citizen. The world mapped according to gun ownership \nGiven that travellers to many of the countries in the top 10 for gun deaths are warned of the risks (the Foreign Office warns of Colombia, which is number one, with 59.3, that \u201ccrime rates remain high\u201d and that street crime is a problem in major cities), what is the advice for the US? \n\u201cViolent crime, including gun crime, rarely involves tourists, but you should take care when travelling in unfamiliar areas,\u201d it says . \u201cAvoid walking through less travelled areas along, especially at night.\u201d Which US cities have the highest rate of shootings \u2013 and does it impact tourism? \nCities with consistently high murder rates include St Louis, Baltimore, Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Chicago has experienced a surge in its murder rate Credit: Getty \nMurder in the US is rising at its fastest pace in a quarter of a century. Using statistics from 73 of 83 US cities with populations over 250,000, data analysts Five Thirty Eight calculated a 11.3 per cent increase, following a hike of 14.8 per cent from 2014 to 2015. \nThe data highlighted Chicago (59 per cent increase) and Memphis (56 per cent), San Antonio (61 per cent) and even Las Vegas (31 per cent) as big-hitters. It showed that St Louis remained the national murder capital of the US, with nearly 60 murders per 100,000 residents. \nSo what of visitor numbers to Chicago, number 10 in the ranking for welcoming the most overseas visitors. According to Choose Chicago, as the murder rate shot up, the city saw a 2.5 per cent increase in domestic and overseas visitors, to a record 53.9 million, breaking the previous record of 52.6, achieved in 2015. Countries with more guns have more mass shootings \nIn 2015, St Louis welcomed 23.9 million visitors. In 2016 this number rose to 25.8 million. \nCompare that to other destinations around the world to have suffered falls in their tourism numbers after terror attacks. Paris, Brussels and Nice all experienced slumps in the wake of attacks, while visitor numbers to Tunisia and Egypt have plummeted. Does Las Vegas anticipate a fall in tourist numbers? \nThe US tourist board has not yet responded to a request for comment. However, a statement released by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority read: \n\u201cThe thoughts and prayers of all of Las Vegas go out to the victims and their families. This was a horrific, yet isolated, incident. At this time, it is important to allow the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police to conclude their investigation into the incident and to attend to the needs of the victims and their families. Las Vegas is a strong community that will work through this tragic incident. We are grateful beyond words to our incomparable law enforcement, first responders and everyone who continues to help victims and their families.\u201d Do gun controls vary from state to state? \nYes, and some states are considered more relaxed than others when it comes to gun control. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence has developed a point system that grades all 50 US states on the relative strengths of their laws of firearms. \nIt ranks Mississippi as the worst, followed by Missouri and Kansas. Each received an F grading. \nOf Mississippi, the organisation said: \u201cIn 2016 Mississippi weakened its gun laws by allowing concealed carry without a license, giving it the weakest gun laws in the nation - and, correspondingly, one of the highest gun death rates.\u201d The 10 states with the least strict gun laws Mississippi", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hugh morris", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "syed rizwan farook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tashfeen malik", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "foreign office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "disney world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas metropolitan police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas convention and visitors authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "law center to prevent gun violence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "visitor bureau", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mojave desert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burundi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memphis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tunisia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san bernardino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colombia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando central and south", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san antonio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st louis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas convention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baltimore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sin city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:02:15.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42dba6c075871a98402f3fc6444f483514a5f120", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROXzNkIHJ1sm_PMmEjfl6y7J83U14e3XuXDGnz.XFcHQJcP1uP2hQThO7pnHZ7GRP6yUfBD1w9EdnJqauOtLEv4K8R9OiahT7PeyMynzqmcAu8SMbibcuQMKLN5MhvVlET9jmNx3ZixNN", "site_full": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "site": "telegraph.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/london-fashion-week/rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Fashion", "title": "'Flood chic' and 'double-bagging': Karl Lagerfeld makes waterproofing look desirable at Chanel", "title_full": "'Flood chic' and 'double-bagging': Karl Lagerfeld makes waterproofing look desirable at Chanel", "published": "2017-10-03T15:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/fashion/2017/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000142592772-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqW65j7PL7KuAHKtu2ujLTDBsS3eVL-z594VliNFbiZks.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 317, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 68, "comments": 0, "shares": 68}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "42dba6c075871a98402f3fc6444f483514a5f120", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROXzNkIHJ1sm_PMmEjfl6y7J83U14e3XuXDGnz.XFcHQJcP1uP2hQThO7pnHZ7GRP6yUfBD1w9EdnJqauOtLEv4K8R9OiahT7PeyMynzqmcAu8SMbibcuQMKLN5MhvVlET9jmNx3ZixNN", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lisa Armstrong", "published": "2017-10-03T15:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "'Flood chic' and 'double-bagging': Karl Lagerfeld makes waterproofing look desirable at Chanel", "text": "Lisa Armstrong , Fashion Director, The Daily Telegraph, Paris, France 3 October 2017 \u2022 1:45pm \nH as Karl Lagerfeld been taking note of Brigitte Macron\u2019s weapon of choice?

Perhaps this was all a metaphor for the abundant liquidity of the Chanel house, which will doubtless receive a boost when those transparent patent-toed waders become cult items. Or perhaps the cascading water was an allusion to the gallons of Chanel scent that make this one of the most successful luxury houses in the world \u2013 according to The Perfume Shop, Chanel No 5 has topped the list of most popular scents in the UK for the past 25 years. At any rate all that H20 irrigated Lagerfeld\u2019s imagination: shimmering 1930s style cocktail dresses in apricot or ivory, iridescent tweeds , semi sheer woven basket skirts and a blue ripple-effect print on chiffon gowns contributed to the impression of a theme that had been comprehensively explored.

Faversham, Kent, restaurant review: a difficult balancing act 3 Kathryn Flett 3 October 2017 \u2022 1:33pm \nA ccording to the website Pubsgalore.co.uk , which keeps track of openings and closures, there are currently 302 establishments in the UK called The Plough, making it the nation\u2019s seventh most popular pub name \u2013 down from 322 and fourth place in 2016. Meanwhile, 570 Red Lions are still jointly lording it at number one. \nAssuming most Ploughs are rural, those 20 rusty retirees appear to support CAMRA\u2019s (Campaign for Real Ale) analysis: \u201cRural and suburban communities are still bearing the brunt of pub closures. Rural areas saw a net loss of 231 pubs in the last six months\u2026\u201d Eating out: The Telegraph's latest restaurant reviews \nI like \u2013 nay, love \u2013 a Plough by that or any other name, and will travel quite far to find a good one. As a townie, however, my wishlist for a country pub is unlikely to be the same as a local\u2019s. For example, having driven to my Plough, I\u2019ll likely order myself a lager-shandy and, if appropriate, head straight outside to a garden with a view of hills/valleys/rivers/red kites/whatever. \nBeing well fed is also important, possibly with something that sooner or later will have me reaching for statins. I\u2019ll also cast an eye over the interiors, clocking whether there\u2019s carpet (awarding it a sticky-tackiness rating out of five) or bare-boards. If the exterior temperature falls below 59F, I\u2019ll probably want that fire lit. I\u2019ll also notice if the loos have an \u201camusing\u201d gender spec \u2013 \u201cMEN to the left because WOMEN are always right\u201d, for example. And I\u2019ll clock whether there\u2019s a hand-dryer or paper towels, pump-action soap dispensers or bars. I know: I\u2019m absolutely exhausting to relax with. \nOne Thursday in mid-September, I booked online for Saturday supper for four (me, my partner and his two sons) at The Plough Inn, Stalisfield, Kent. Invited to outline \u201cany food requirements\u201d, I fessed up that my stepsons are gluten-free. An email acknowledgement of the booking followed. On the day, however, one teenager bailed, so just three of us drove the 30-odd miles from home to the pretty whitewashed pub, high on the Kentish Weald, a few miles from Faversham. Let the record show that there were bare floorboards and soap dispensers, the fire was unlit, the loo signs generic and there were no window coverings in the restaurant area \nT his Plough was taken over by a young couple, the Bakers, in 2014; Richard cooks and Marianne does front of house. They offer a fine selection of Kentish craft beers, ciders and a have long wine list. There\u2019s a campsite out back and a Waitrose Good Food Guide sticker on the front door. They have a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence, a Facebook page and a fiddly Twitter handle . There is, clearly, commendable ambition and energy being expended to ensure that this particular Plough does not rust. \nAs we were Famished-near-Faversham, I immediately announced our arrival and said we\u2019d booked for dinner. However, the woman behind the bar found nothing, \u201cthough you\u2019re fine for a walk-in.\u201d Which, given our 60-mile round trip, was a relief. We sat straight away and ordered two halves of local winemakers Chapel Down\u2019s pleasing \u201cCurious Brew\u201d lager, and a lime-and-soda for the 16-year-old. Let the record show that there were bare floorboards and soap dispensers, the fire was unlit, the loo signs generic and there were no window coverings in the restaurant area. \nWe chose from both the menu and the blackboard specials. Archie was offered gluten-free bread (though not a gluten-free bun for his main-course burger, which he ordered bunless) and had a bowl of moules to start (\u201cFine\u201d). I kicked off with the salmon carpaccio (\u201cwith crab and octopus bound in citrus cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, squid, samphire\u201d) \u2013 this was too chilled, smacking of wedding-caterer\u2019s pre-prep. My partner\u2019s chicken livers on toast were pronounced \u201covercooked\u201d and the sauce \u201cover-reduced\u201d. So far, so-so. Game for anything: duck at The Plough Credit: Jeff Gilbert for The Telegraph \nO ur plates sat around, cleared only when the next courses appeared. The burger had giant chips and was pronounced \u201cgood\u201d. My partner\u2019s monkfish, prawn and mussel bouillabaisse was, however, \u201ctoo tomatoey, and the mussels a bit evil \u2013 I don\u2019t trust them.\u201d Admittedly he\u2019d only just returned from a week in Tuscany and was probably being a bit spoilt and pouty \u2013 but nobody wants to tangle with an \u201cevil\u201d mussel, even if the previous mussel course had been \u201cfine\u201d. \nMeanwhile, my Barbary duck breast with bubble and squeak, pak choi, sweetcorn, chestnut mushrooms and sweet chilli jus arrived cleverly camouflaged as a special of \u201clocal venison loin with mash, kale, butternut squash and honey peach jus\u201d. I was so hungry I couldn\u2019t be bothered to send it back, but I wished I had: it was lukewarm and slathered in another catering college-style reduction, this one fiercely over-vinegared, which effectively did for the sweet subtlety of Bambi. The modern rural Plough must attract tricky townies and those who consider pubs with culinary ambition to be taking the pithivier \nT his all smacked of a kitchen that could cook but may have been understaffed. In the event, I was the only one with room/inclination to test-drive a dessert; the apple and summer fruit shortbread crumble with (cold) custard was delightfully sweet and tart, and quite enough for two, so it felt polite to leave a mouthful. Each to his furrow: a dessert of chocolate cheesecake with candied orange at The Plough Credit: Jeff Gilbert for The Telegraph \nA nd there we have it. The modern rural Plough has a tricky balance to maintain. On the one hand, it must attract tricky townies with annoying gluten-free offspring who are looking to live the rural dream for an hour or two. On the other, it needs to keep sweet those who consider pubs with culinary ambition to be taking the pithivier. To my mind that\u2019s an unenviable task for the landlords and ladies of 21st century Ploughs. Unenviable \u2013 and very hard to pull off. And I salute those who try. \nStalisfield, nr Faversham, Kent ME13 0HY", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kent", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "faversham", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kathryn flett", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stalisfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "archie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff gilbert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marianne", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "camra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red lions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tripadvisor certificate of excellence", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "stalisfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentish weald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faversham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tuscany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentish", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:08:02.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "abd402a473f0d421f531174bc9afa50c16c20de9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRwKYlGfxqeVGRKUQAogs48Hn1vdRyisM0n5zRjnlAMH3mypCPiVNFcbs8YSm3KPTN6Y0Hza6yd7JvYkxTiOJeb5NvvcdkuZphIEVDG0Tymaw--", "site_full": "jobs.telegraph.co.uk", "site": "telegraph.co.uk", "site_section": "http://jobs.telegraph.co.uk//jobsrss/", "site_categories": ["job_search", "jobs"], "section_title": "Job Search RSS", "title": "Recruitment Genius: Administrator - Utility Company in Rochdale", "title_full": "Recruitment Genius: Administrator - Utility Company in Rochdale", "published": "2017-10-03T16:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://du231s836adgi.cloudfront.net/getasset/96fe52b9-fecf-4ad0-a6fd-dfc4076cba7d/;w=360;h=200", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 317, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "abd402a473f0d421f531174bc9afa50c16c20de9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRwKYlGfxqeVGRKUQAogs48Hn1vdRyisM0n5zRjnlAMH3mypCPiVNFcbs8YSm3KPTN6Y0Hza6yd7JvYkxTiOJeb5NvvcdkuZphIEVDG0Tymaw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Recruitment Genius: Administrator - Utility Company in Rochdale", "text": "Your CV must be a .doc, .pdf, .docx, .rtf, and no bigger than 1MB Your covering message for Administrator - Utility Company in Rochdale 4000 characters left Allow recruiters to find my CV in the CV database Email me jobs like this one when they become available Get your free CV review from \nBy applying for a job listed on Telegraph Jobs you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy.

Tracey Wilkinson was described as a Good Samaritan with a heart of gold \nH er husband gave him a job at his manufacturing firm and the family invited him to enjoy Christmas lunch with them last year. \nBut in March, Barley, who had began taking drugs, turned up at their home unexpectedly and stabbed Mrs Wilkinson and her son to death. Husband Peter Wilkinson, who survived the attack, and daughter Lydia, hold hands as they speak at Lloyd House in Birmingham about their loss Credit: PA \nH er husband, who had been out walking the dog was stabbed six times in the face, neck, abdomen and back. \nThe family's older daughter, who was studying biology at Bristol University discovered the horror after hearing of an attack in her home town and putting 'Stourbridge Stabbings' into the Google search engine and seeing pictures of her house. \nBarley, who was flanked by four security guards, stood emotionless with shoulders slumped as he admitted two counts of murder. \nHe had already pleaded guilty to attempting to murder Mr Wilkinson. \nBarley was described in court as a \"compulsive liar\" and a \"Jekyll and Hyde\" character with an obsession with knives and a long history of violence. \nIt was said he had previously boasted he would one day become a murderer and dreamed of spending the rest of his life behind bars as a notorious criminal. \nIn February - one month before the stabbings - he said on Facebook he was plotting to \"take down his family\" and wondered \"how many he could get before he got caught.\" My wife was a very compassionate woman. She wouldn\u2019t see harm come to anybody, she liked to help people Peter Wilkinson \nM r Wilkinson said: \u201cThere\u2019s no motive, there is no explanation...I wish my wife had never set eyes on him.\u201d \nMrs Wilkinson was described by her husband as a \"compassionate woman\" who did voluntary work with old people. \nShe had first met Barley when she found him trying to keep warm in a cardboard box outside a branch of Tesco in Stourbridge. \nShe then took him to Dudley Council offices in her car and helped him get a place in a homeless hostel. \nHe said: \u201cThings developed from there. Even though he was in a hostel, he had no money and food, so Tracey would organise breakfast and dinner for him every day, be it at our house or somewhere else.\" Floral tributes outside the home of the Wilkinson family Credit: PA \nM r Wilkinson said Barley, who had lost both his parents at a young age, and was brought up in foster homes, had told him: \"I just need somebody to give me a chance, I need somebody to give me a lucky break.\" \nThree weeks later the company director offered him a job at a branch of his manufacturing firm in Newport, south Wales. \nUnfortunately Barley went off the rails and began taking drugs and in September last year he lost his job, but remained on good terms with the family. Aaron Barley has pleaded guilty to double murder and attempted murder \nI n October last year Mr Wilkinson found him asleep on their drive way and the family decided to try to help him again. \nHe said: \"In a similar vein to what we had done last time, we managed to get accommodation for him.

The third was given over to the middle-class, while the fourth \u2013 which will also be opened to the public next month \u2013 was the realm of traders, merchants and shopkeepers. \nOrdinary folk had to clamber up steep flights of stone steps and walk along dimly-lit tunnels to reach the fifth and final level. \n\u201cIt was tiring to get all the way up there,\u201d said Professor Rea. \u201cA lot of the plebeians brought food from home \u2013 pieces of chicken, cereals, that kind of thing. \n\u201cYou have to remember that the games lasted all day so they and their families needed some sustenance.\u201d \nThe poor were at least compensated with expansive views not only of the 50,000 other people crammed into the Colosseum, but of the nearby Forum and the Palatine Hill, where emperors built their palaces. \nSpectators received tickets which indicated their seat numbers and which entrance to use, much as in modern stadiums.

Artefacts on loan from various British museums and institutions, together with loans from private collections nationwide are mixed up with modern and contemporary bronze sculptures by the likes of Louise Bourgeois, Henry Moore and David Smith - along with Marcel Duchamp\u2019s bronze cast sink stopper, Subodh Gupta\u2019s bronze potatoes and a cast bronze flower by Martin Creed. \nThese have been mischievously interspersed with \u201cancient\u201d bronze objects purchased by Beard from eBay, inviting us to ponder on the magical \u2013 and confusing \u2013 power of a museum display to render even the most insignificant object precious.

Whether Betty Tompkins\u2019 monumental photorealist paintings of sexual acts, Marilyn Minter\u2019s Porn Grid photography series or Renate Bertlmann\u2019s sculptures combining dildoes and cacti, their work was considered way too raunchy and transgressive for the male-dominated art world and even too hardcore for mainstream feminism. \nAs a result many of these pioneering figures have remained in obscurity for decades \u2013 often even being excluded from more recent museum shows of women\u2019s art. In our current climate it is especially appropriate that their defiance of prejudice and prudishness is at last receiving its proper recognition. Marilyn Minter, Rivulet, 2017. Dye Sublimation print Credit: Marilyn Minter Georgina Starr, Androgynous Egg: Frieze Projects \nA key feature of Frieze is its program of specially commissioned and usually non-commercial artists\u2019 projects. One of the highlights of this year\u2019s predominantly female lineup is a performance extravaganza from Georgina Starr. \nOne of the YBA generation whose work has recently been shown more in Europe than at home, Starr is a born storyteller who established an early reputation for creating works with complicated and emotional narratives exploring female identity, history fiction and biography which extend into multilayered theatrical events. \nThere promises to be all of the above in Starr\u2019s Androgynous Egg, which is based on her as-yet-unreleased debut novel and features, along with the artist, five dancer vocalists and a singer with a disembodied head emerging from the top of a table.

At the centre of this mock studio are two large tables, covered in piles of books, papers, photographs and cut-out figures lifted directly off the artist\u2019s desk.

Ropac\u2019s Frieze Masters stand knowingly plays both with and off our contemporary paranoia and fixation on this doomy tome by devoting itself solely to works made in that particular year. \nIn doing so, this array also offers an alternative point of view, with show-stopping pieces such modern masters as Georg Baselitz, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol, Joseph Beuys and Robert Rauschenberg, all of which confirm that, far from Orwell\u2019s grim and dehumanized vision, 1984 was in fact a year of dynamic and diverse individual creativity. Another prominent presence on the stand are the enduringly maverick duo Gilbert and George, who in 1984 received a nomination for the first-ever Turner Prize.

That was in 1985. \nToday, after an Emmy award-winning TV adaptation of the book , starring Elisabeth Moss , it seems more relevant than ever before. Little wonder, many have hailed Atwood, now 77, as something of a sage. That was certainly the mood as she took to the stage at the South Bank Centre - I can't remember seeing an author get a standing ovation. \nThe writer, who has published almost 60 works, held the audience rapt for 90 minutes. Here are some of her insights... 1. The Handmaid's Tale can be funny \nAtwood regaled the crowd with some of the more unusual 'homages' to the Handmaid's Tale , including Scottish tributes, cupcakes, the Handsoap's Tale and They Finally Made a Handmaid's Tale for Men - 'the story of Manfred, a man just trying to survive in a world under the harsh rule of the feminazi.' \n\"People are sending me knitted chickens in handmaid outfits, and dog and cat pictures,\" she said. \"I'm not sure they should be crammed into little red frocks and bonnets. \n\"There's no limit.\" \u2014 Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) June 15, 2017 HOLY CRAP my creepy prego-handmaid cupcakes turned out so well i can't resist tweeting them before the party #handmaidstale #partyplanning pic.twitter.com/VYzHpNexPA \u2014 \ud83c\udf83Page Lady (@thepagelady) April 28, 2017 2. Everything in the book has happened \n\"I made it historical because then no one could say it was the product of my dark, twisted imagination,\" said Atwood. \nE verything in the Handmaid's Tale has taken place in the past, at some point. \"Then no one could say 'it couldn't happen here',\" she added. \nAtwood also said that some elements of the TV adaptation wouldn't have worked in 1985: \"If I'd put FGM in the book, nobody would have known what it was. Everyone would have thought I'd made it up.\" Elisabeth Moss (r) in TV's The Handmaid's Tale Credit: MGM 3. The bonnets have a life of their own \nA sked about the number of women, particularly in the US, wearing red cloaks and white bonnets to protest against potential curbs to women's reproductive rights, Atwood explained why it worked: \n\"No one can send you away, as you're not making a disturbance. But it's an immediately recognisable symbol. Everybody knows what you mean. \n\"It's escaped from the book and now has this life of its own.\" The Handmaid's Tale protests taking place across the world 4. Writing takes optimism \n\"You have to be an optimist to write,\" Atwood told us. \"You have to assume you'll finish your book. You have to assume it will be reasonably good. You have to assume a publisher will undertake to publish it. That people will pick it up, and like and understand it. \n\"That's a hug amount of optimism just to get out of bed in the morning. You have to get up, get dressed and write at your book. And sometimes that takes more than two cups of coffee.\" Here she is @MargaretAtwood who has published almost 60 books and spoke wonderfully @southbankcentre #AskAtwood pic.twitter.com/4jdXDzysqQ \u2014 Claire Cohen (@clairecohen) October 2, 2017 5.

It would seem nice at first, because we all like feeling connected to others. \nBut if it kept happening, throughout the day, and the interruptions grew incessant, it would soon drive you bananas. By the end of the day, you\u2019d be just about ready to punch the next person who interrupted you. \nAnd yet almost any smartphone user will gladly suffer this level of disruption in their every waking hour, courtesy of the endless notifications we receive from our devices. \nAnyone who\u2019s been a member of a busy WhatsApp group or Facebook Messenger conversation will be familiar with this. We frequently wake up to a string of new messages, scrolling through them, zombie-like, before we even leave our beds. We compulsively check them last thing at night. And in the intervening hours? A constant stream of notifications alerts us to every muscle twitch or half-thought experienced by our contacts. \nNow, surprise surprise, we learn this is not making us happy. One third of notifications that pop up cause a downturn in our mood, researchers have found . Rather than gladdening our hearts, they frequently leave us feeling hostile, upset, nervous, afraid or ashamed.

How apt this seems now, in an age when we all are so willingly yoked to our smartphones, encaged in prisons of our own making. \nS o how do our phones imprison and annoy us? Let us count the ways. 1. The hyperactive WhatsApp group \nDon\u2019t your friends have jobs? How is it possible that you can turn away for 10 minutes and then return to find 56 new messages in the thread? This presents you with a dilemma: do you write off the missed ones and start again from the bottom, or scroll through every last message in case you\u2019ve missed something crucial? Sometimes the information you need - the name of the restaurant you\u2019re meeting at, for instance - will be hidden halfway up the chain. Ignoring the thread feels too risky. Reading it takes up aeons of your time. First world problem? Maybe, but it\u2019s a bloody difficult one. What's everyone going to wear? This question alone can spark a subsidiary thread of 40 messages pinging into your consciousness 2. The event-planning thread \nI t might be a hen or stag do , or someone\u2019s 40th birthday. It might be a weekend away with friends, or even just a meal. Whatever it is, you can\u2019t remember how you ever used to organise such things without the requisite 800 planning messages. \nEven subsidiary questions - who is bringing parmesan for the Friday night arrival supper? Who is arriving at which station and when? How is everyone planning to interpret the \u201ccreative black tie \u201d dress code? - can branch off into discussions of 40 messages or more. \nI\u2019ve been on hen dos where the time I\u2019ve spent reading the planning messages beforehand has actually exceeded the time I\u2019ve spent there. This surely can\u2019t be right. 3. The \u2018interloper\u2019 pictures \nWhy have you got six photos of a baby you can\u2019t even identify in your own smartphone picture collection? That would be because they\u2019ve been sent to you at some point and your phone has taken it upon itself to absorb these interloper images into your own picture library. \nIf you didn\u2019t have to spend so much time deleting these, you might actually find the time to go and visit this baby, whoever it belongs to. What a beautiful baby. But whose is it, and why is it in your phone? Credit: Stockbroker / Alamy Stock Photo 4. The work email \nY our work email is on your smartphone and your boss knows this, so no excuse not to reply when you\u2019re in bed/on holiday/on the loo. The longer you put it off, the more messages you\u2019ll have to wade through when you do bite the bullet and check your inbox. The worst thing you can do is glance at them and resolve to respond later as you are 99 per cent sure to forget. 5. The banter \nThis can take place across a range of platforms - WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, email - and requires a quick-fire response. No-one wants to be that person who comes to a thread full of jokes some five hours after the last message was sent, and in vain tries to join in with a now irrelevant piece of wit. Everyone\u2019s moved on. Don\u2019t be that person. (NB I am usually that person.) If your email inbox was in paper form, it would look like this Credit: RichLegg/ Getty Images Contributor 6. The time-consuming video \nP ing!

Nothing too damaging to the driving sim\u2019s reputation, but perhaps not quite the example of precise perfection it has prided itself on. Motorsport 5 was a stripped down disappointment, while 6 corrected that mistake with terrific driving and plenty of stuff but no defined direction. To an extent, the track-based stalwart has seen its brasher, open-world offspring, Forza Horizon , whizz past it in terms of critical acclaim. \nDevelopers Turn 10 told The Telegraph that each Forza game informs the other. And for the first time for the parent game, this feels very much the truth. Forza Motorsport 7 is a brilliant, bold and more care-free racer, throwing variety and challenge at you as fast as its cars tear around the track. That isn\u2019t to say that Turn 10 has diluted its superb but accessible simulation, far from it, but in terms of style, 7 is the series at its best. Many more tracks have rain and night options, which changes the dynamic of a race considerably. \nB ut first: that driving. Forza 7 is an extraordinary showcase of audio, visual and tactile feedback, even before we have played the enhanced Xbox One X version. The cars are ferociously loud, with guttural engines roaring as you tear down straights, exhausts crackling and popping on deceleration, the scream of tyres on tarmac. \nIt assaults the ears and the eyes. As you escape the baking sun of Dubai and enter a tunnel the echo of engines thunders against the concrete, when passing the statues on Prague\u2019s Charles Bridge each one is accompanied by the whoosh of air, speed through a puddle on a sodden corner of Silverstone and there is an almighty whumph as the car jerks and water spatters the camera. \nMost importantly, you can feel it in the fingers. While real aficionados will be cracking out their steering wheel, I\u2019m not sure there is a game better suited to the Xbox One\u2019s mechanical controller. The measured rumble in the triggers reacts to each dip and bump in the tarmac as you feather the accelerator through a turn. Each vehicle, whether its threading a Porsche Spyder through the pack or wrenching a hulking truck around the track, feels just as you may have imagined it. \nAnd that\u2019s the thing with Forza: everything is cranked up to 11. It\u2019s as if Turn 10 has taken the dream of driving these vehicles and reproduced that, rather than complete authenticity. Realistic enough, certainly, particularly as you reduce the assists and the roster becomes even wilder to handle. It is exhilarating stuff, though racers wanting 100% accuracy might have their heads turned by more slavish simulations like Assetto Corsa and iRacing or the depth of Project Cars 2. Forza is an accessible sim for a mainstream audience, meaning things like the AI being both aggressive but easily outmuscled. Shunting and trading paint as you vie for position in the pack is certainly not encouraged, but doesn\u2019t bring the penalty that it should. Forza Motorsport is in no way an arcade racer, but you are given choice and leeway in how you want to drive. Forza | Series timeline \nT hat is also what marks the single-player career in Forza Motorsport 7 as a real improvement for the series. The old style of driving sims have you starting slow and building up a cash and car collection, keeping many of its treats under lock and key. This game\u2019s Forza Driver's Cup has the sense to not make things too restrictive, immediately putting you behind the wheel of a supercar. Within the first few races, you will have had the option of truck racing, Gymkhana and even whipping a limousine around the Top Gear track sideswiping bowling pins. \nYou still have to work towards certain goals of course, and there is still a strong thread of building a vast garage filled with everything from tricked out Vauxhall Astras to classic muscle cars to squealing track toys. Your progression through each of the career\u2019s six Championship ranks is gated by your \u2018collection\u2019 level, which progresses each time you add a vehicle to your garage. Collecting is an intoxicating part of any racing game, but Forza 7 makes sure to pepper your progress with one-off challenges. Like whipping around Brands Hatch in a Brabham BT-24 while surrounded by other 60s open-wheeled racers. Or using the latest Porsche 911 GT2 RS to try and overtake a conga line of previous models. \nT here\u2019s an argument that the career is too unstructured, a great mess of activities to sift through. But it is enormously good fun, injected with momentum and choice that means it doesn\u2019t wear its tyres down too quickly. Compared with the occasional grind of previous games, giving you more freedom to just get behind the wheel is a marked upgrade. And if you do want to break away from the Drivers Cup, \u2018Rival\u2019 challenges pit you against ghosts of other players, dropping you in a specific car on a specific track and asking you to beat their lap time in a rolling challenge. \nWhere Forza 7 is less successful is in the introduction of \u2018mods\u2019, cards unlocked via loot crates. Which are in turn bought with in-game credits. These limited-use cards allow you to earn more XP for each race by adding a modifier or target. Execute a certain number of good passes or perfect corners, say, or ensure you finish 1st in a particular race. It\u2019s all fine, and can add a little extra challenge on each race, but feels including more because loot crates are very much en vogue than because it fits Forza. It also means that players that drive with no assists (or gradually switch them off as they improve) do not get extra reward for their skills. That this has been reduced to a slightly confusing, slightly random card game seems a bit unnecessary. Still, Forza is rarely one to turn down the chance to toy with gaming fads. Even Destiny\u2019s wandering merchant Xur is an inspiration here, with a specialist dealer that sells special cars at limited times. \nFrippery aside, Forza Motorsport 7 is an exceptional, exhilarating and absurdly polished racing game. It may lack the depth of some of its more serious competition, but it finally feels comfortable in its framework as a more accessible and energetic simulation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silverstone", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "forza motorsport", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "forza driver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forza horizon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vauxhall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "porsche", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forza", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "charles bridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:34:09.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a0afb077d1552eaa812df545e8a55f92ee7b2280", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROXzNkIHJ1sm_Oe_.ZvlkTX9rp9EMg2n9Q7up1vd5TZwwTuZd9NFnZ3DaMN6Pr41jEKBK9BB0l8l9w9DXmg_exrjBGDOo8Y4Xyw--", "site_full": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "site": "telegraph.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "www.telegraph.co.uk for the latest news from the UK and around the world.", "title": "When is the 2018 World Cup draw, how does it work and what teams are involved?", "title_full": "When is the 2018 World Cup draw, how does it work and what teams are involved?", "published": "2017-10-03T20:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2017/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000139829279-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqwa7eFTdQSD5NyPivMNzQ1MdwDz5jz69Xj3N0rYPv2O0.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 317, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 8, "comments": 0, "shares": 8}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a0afb077d1552eaa812df545e8a55f92ee7b2280", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROXzNkIHJ1sm_Oe_.ZvlkTX9rp9EMg2n9Q7up1vd5TZwwTuZd9NFnZ3DaMN6Pr41jEKBK9BB0l8l9w9DXmg_exrjBGDOo8Y4Xyw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Telegraph Sport", "published": "2017-10-03T20:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "When is the 2018 World Cup draw, how does it work and what teams are involved?", "text": "What is it?

It is thought about 80,000 transfers have taken place this year alone. \nFinancial advice is required by law when savers transfer final salary benefits worth \u00a330,000 or more, but an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has found that in many cases the advice is poor. \nOver two years it has reviewed 88 cases where an adviser recommended the saver transfer out of a pension. It agreed this was the right thing to do in only 47pc of the examined cases. \nIn the majority of cases the watchdog either said a transfer was \"unsuitable\", or it was unclear whether it was the right thing to do. \nThe analysis also raised suspicions that advisers who encouraged savers to transfer out of their pensions were doing so in order to then sell them investments. The review concluded, for instance, that only a third (35pc) of the investments recommended by the adviser after a transfer were suitable. \nIn recent months the FCA has intensified its examination of pension transfers. \nFour advice firms have stopped advising on transfers after the watchdog intervened, while a further 16 companies have agreed to stop conducting transfers as a result of its work on preventing scams, the FCA said. \nThat has led to a severe lack of supply of advisers leaving many people, including dozens of Telegraph Money readers, unable to find an adviser to help them move their pension. The regulator has confirmed that it only requires savers to take advice before transferring: it does not matter what the advice is. \nThe latest findings will spark fears the watchdog, which is due to published updated rules this year, will make it harder for savers to move their money even where there is a clear advantage to doing so. \nAdvisers and regulators are anxious to ensure the pension mis-selling scandal of the Eighties and Nineties is not repeated. \nHowever, a crackdown or even ban on transfers would bar millions of people from the \"pension freedom\" reforms that have revolutionised the savings market over the past two years. \nNathan Long, of pension firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"The starting point for anyone with a final salary pension should be to assume it is best left as it is. \n\"Transferring usually means giving up a promised income in return for the uncertainties of investing in the stock market. \n\"But it could work out in savers' advantage in certain circumstances for example if they are in poor health, are single or have concerns about the employer that provides the pension.\" \nsam.brodbeck@telegraph.co.uk", "highlightText": "",

\u2022 2:55pm \nS tephen Paddock, the Las Vegas gunman, was helped by Nevada having some of the most relaxed gun laws in the US with the governor, Brian Sandoval, being given an \"A\" rating by the National Rifle Association. \nIn 2014 the NRA gave Mr Sandoval a glowing endorsement as he ran for re-election. \n\u201cAs Governor, Brian Sandoval has consistently showed his commitment to the Second Amendment by signing important pro-gun reform legislation, including measures to improve Nevada\u2019s concealed carry law,\" said Chris Cox, chairman of the NRA's political victory fund. \nMr Sandoval earned the NRA's praise for vetoing a bill which would have tightened background checks on all gun sales in the state. \nHe said the bill did \u201clittle to prevent criminals from unlawfully obtaining firearms.\u201d Concert-goers take cover during Las Vegas shooting 00:34 \n\u201cSenate Bill 221, while laudable in its efforts to strengthen reporting requirements concerning mentally ill persons, imposes unreasonable burdens and harsh penalties upon law-abiding Nevadans, while doing little to prevent criminals from unlawfully obtaining firearms,\u201d Sandoval wrote in his veto statement.\" \nH is veto came at a time when there were growing calls for gun laws to be tightened following the Sandy Hook massacre in December 2012 which claimed the lives of 20 children and six staff members at an elementary school in Connecticut. \nMr Sandoval, who justified his stance as protecting Americans' second amendment right to bear arms, was condemned by critics, including Michael Bloomberg, then the New York mayor. \n\u201cRather than sign sensible legislation that keeps guns out of the hands of convicted felons and the mentally ill, Governor Sandoval has decided to preserve the loopholes that they use to buy guns,\" he said. \nNevada also imposes no restrictions on the capacity of magazines which firearms enthusiasts are able to clip onto their guns. In brief | Worst US mass shootings \nL arge capacity magazines, capable of holding up to 100 rounds of ammunition, make it possible for a shooter to kill and maim a large number of people very quickly. \nAdam Lanza, the gunman at Sandy Hook, had fitted 30-round magazines to his weapon, making it possible for him to fire 154 rounds in under five minutes. \nIn common with all but eight states, Nevada imposes no restrictions on magazine - or clip - size. \nDuring the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton called for assault rifles, currently only banned in seven states, to be outlawed. Brian Sandoval Credit: Sam Wasson/Getty \nP addock's lethal potential was increased by using devices known as \"bump-stocks\" , which effectively turned his semi-automatic rifle into a machine gun - weapons which have been illegal since 1986. \n\"This replacement shoulder stock turns a semi-automatic rifle into a weapon that can fire at a rate of 400 to 800 rounds per minute,\" warned Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat senator from California. \nSeveral of the weapons recovered from Paddock's hotel room and home had been modified.

He managed to phone the emergency services after being stabbed six times and spent 11 days in hospital recovering from his wounds. In his own words, Peter Wilkinson describes his family's ordeal \n\u201cMy wife was a very compassionate woman. She wouldn\u2019t see harm come to anybody, she liked to help people. \n\u201cShe did a certain amount of voluntary work helping old people. She was very chatty and made people feel at ease.\" On how his wife first encountered her killer \n\"She was shopping one day at Tesco in Stourbridge and she came out and Aaron was keeping warm in a cardboard box and she was taken aback by this, and decided off-the-cuff that she wanted to help him. \n\u201cSo she took him in her car to Dudley Council to get help and from that point he lived in a hostel for a few days, organised by my wife. That was in March 2016. \n\u201cThings developed from there. Even though he was in a hostel, he had no money and food, so Tracey would organise breakfast and dinner for him every day, be it at our house or somewhere else. Tracey Wilkinson was described by her husband as 'stylish... elegant... very compassionate' Credit: Caters \n\u201cI remember after that talking to him one of the evenings when he was at dinner with us. \n\u201cI just tried to get a feeling of what he felt and what he wanted in life. And I can remember quite vividly him saying to me \u2018I just need somebody to give me a chance, I need somebody to give me a lucky break\u2019. \n\u201cAfter that - maybe three or four weeks later - I actually employed him. After long consultation with my management team, we decided that we would like to help him, so I employed him at one of the businesses that I run down in Newport in south Wales.\" How Aaron Barley 'went off the rails' after taking drugs \n\u201cIn September 2016 he went off the rails. He started taking drugs and as a business we had to let him go. It was very amicable. He knew that that was the case because of what he\u2019d been doing. Tracey Wilkinson and her son Pierce, 13, were murdered by Aaron Barley, right Credit: SWNS \n\u201cHe actually said at the time that he had started taking drugs because his mother had died, which was subsequently found to be untrue.\u201d \nA sked if he had noticed a change in Barley\u2019s personality during that time, Mr Wilkinson added: \u201cI would say we had seen a change but a change conversant with something that you might expect to see if somebody had been taking drugs - not a change in his general persona.\" Finding him 'asleep like a bundle on the drive' \n\"I remember in late October or early November coming back from walking the dog one of the mornings and finding him asleep like a bundle in the corner of the drive. \n\u201cI got him up and made him some tea. I believe he\u2019d been on the streets and had been badly beaten. He was covered in bruises and my wife being the compassionate soul that she was, decided that as a family we should help him again. \n\u201cIn a similar vein to what we had done last time, we managed to get accommodation for him. We paid for some accommodation ourselves for him. Aaron Barley (right) in the dock at Birmingham Crown Court Credit: Elizabeth Cook/PA \n\u201cMy wife wouldn\u2019t see him back on the streets so over the next couple of weeks we managed to get council accommodation sorted. \n\u201cAnd he would do general jobs for us, for other members of my family as well, in order to earn some pocket money for food and cigarettes. And he was generally very grateful. Spending Christmas Day with the killer \n\u201cFrom that point onwards, I think through \u2019til Christmas he\u2019d got some part-time work or some cash-in-hand work. And then at Christmas last year he spent Christmas Day with us. \n\u201cHe had Christmas lunch with us. I remember he wrote my wife a card saying \u2018To the mother that I never had\u2019. My wife was very caring and he treated her a bit like a second mother.\" 'We shared a curry... next time I saw him he was stabbing me' \n\u201cHe then, in January, got some full-time work. He\u2019d got a new flat. We were very happy for him. We still saw him then once or twice a week - he would come for dinner. \n\u201cAnd then in early March, he came round one night - the last time I saw him. I bought a curry and I shared a curry and a couple of bottles of beer with him. I dropped him off back at his flat in Brierley Hill that night. \n\"And that was it for about three weeks - the next time I saw him he was sticking a knife into my shoulder.\u201d The attacks: He was dressed in black, with a big knife above his head \nA sked what he could remember of the attack upon him, Mr Wilkinson said: \u201cI did my normal thing of going out to take the dog for a walk. \n\"I came back and I can remember looking through the window at the back door of the house, thinking that everybody must have overslept because nobody was up. \n\u201cI opened the back door and as I did it, he jumped out from behind a wall in the kitchen, all dressed in black, with a big knife held over his head and started stabbing me with it. Police officers outside the Wilkinson family home in Stourbridge Credit: Joe Giddens/PA \n\u201cFrom that point I grappled with him for a short period of time and he stabbed me six times - he stabbed me twice in the face, twice in the abdomen and twice in the back. \n\u201cI thought he was going to carry on stabbing me, but I then heard my car going off the drive - we have got a gravel drive and the crunch of the car going off it was quite distinctive. \n\u201cI got up, I think I was on the lawn at this time. I got up, went into the kitchen and phoned the emergency services, at the time not thinking I was too badly injured.\" 'I was actually dying... I could feel energy draining from me' \n\u201cThen I remember looking around and seeing this huge trail of blood across the floor, which was my blood. I then went back out into the back garden, sat in a chair and I remember talking to the person on the other end of the phone and realising that I was actually dying. \n\"I could feel my lungs filling with fluid and I could feel energy draining from me. \n\u201cThe next thing I remember is ambulances turning up and I can remember hearing helicopters overhead and the police arrived. \n\u201cAn ambulance man tended to me immediately. I remember him jabbing something into me, which is probably what kept me alive. Peter Wilkinson and daughter Lydia relieve their ordeal Credit: Aaron Chown/PA \n\u201cI also remember telling the other ambulance men to go into the house. I remember vividly one coming out behind me and saying \u2018one deceased and one in cardiac arrest\u2019. I knew at that point that I had most likely lost Tracey and Pierce. Then I was taken to the QE.\u201d \nA sked to describe his feelings at that time, Mr Wilkinson said: \u201cI thought I was going to die at that stage. I remember being in the back of the ambulance on the way to hospital. I could feel every bump. I remember getting to the QE and being rushed in and then general anaesthetic being administered and waking up whenever I woke up.\u201d Wife was 'a beautiful woman with a heart of gold' \nPaying his own tributes, Mr Wilkinson said: \u201cMy wife was a beautiful woman with a heart of gold. She was stylish, she was elegant. She was very compassionate. \n\u201cShe cared for others and it\u2019s just so tragic that after trying to help people and to help Aaron, that he should turn on us in this way for no apparent reason.\u201d Tracey Wilkinson was murdered in March last year Credit: West Midlands Police/PA On the murderer: 'I wish my wife had never set eyes on him' \nA sked to comment on his feelings towards Barley, Mr Wilkinson added: \u201cI wish we had never met him - I wish my wife had never set eyes on him.\u201d \nCommenting on his physical condition now, he added: \u201cI was in hospital for 11 nights.

Over 12 days more than 200 films will be screened, representing more than 60 countries as part of the official programme. From projects by established directors to under-the-radar efforts, here are some of the most exciting entries to look forward to this year. 1. Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri Woody Harrelson with Frances McDormand Credit: Fox Searchlight \nM artin McDonagh's (In Bruges, Seven Psycopaths) latest crime film has been delighting festival audiences this year, and should do the same in London. Frances McDormand plays a distraught mother whose police-shaming tactics (the titular billboards) regarding their failure to investigate her daughter's killing earn her the hostility of Woody Harrelson's chief and many of the townsfolk. Expect vigilantism and justice themes worthy of the Coens or Tarantino. Read our review here . 2. Breathe Andrew Garfield and Claire Foy in Andy Serkis's Breathe Credit: Bleecker Street \nA ndy Serkis's directorial debut - and the LFF's opening film - concerns the true story of Robin Cavendish (Andrew Garfield), a young polio victim who becomes a globe-trotting champion of the disabled.

Battle of the Sexes Emma Stone and Steve Carell Credit: Fox Searchlight \nF ittingly this sports drama is made by husband-and-wife team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (who also directed Little Miss Sunshine). Steve Carell and Emma Stone are tennis players Bobby Riggs and Billie Jean King, who faced off in a 1973 exhibition match to determine whether the greatest female players could beat even aging male pros. At the same time, it details King's issues with her own sexuality and Riggs's career-end discontent. Watch the trailer here . 4. Downsizing Credit: Paramount \nM att Damon and Kristen Wiig star as a couple who join in this sci-fi film's subject matter: shrinking oneself to live more economically and sustainably. Although the changed perspective of being five inches tall offers an escape from everyday stresses, it comes with its own problems, and not everyone appears to be getting shrunk willingly.

The Killing of a Sacred Deer Colin Farrell stars in Yorgos Lanthimos's film Credit: A24 \nI n this psychological horror film, Colin Farrell plays Steven Murphy, a hyper-competent cardiovascular specialist with an equally an successful family life. The only way is down. He begins looking out for Martin, a troubled teenager played by Barry Keoghan (of \"I'll be useful\" fame in Dunkirk), who returns the favour by causing chaos in Murphy's Nicole Kidman-starring domestic life. Is the boy the source of all these problems, or does the surgeon have something to hide? Read our review here . 6. Last Flag Flying Bryan Cranston, Steve Carell and Laurence Fishburne in Last Flag Flying Credit: Amazon Studios/Lionsgate \nA comedy-drama from Richard Linklater, this is an adaptation of a 2005 novel by Darryl Ponicsan. Steve Carell, Bryan Cranston and Laurence Fishburne play Vietnam veteran friends who reunite after Carell's son is killed in Iraq.

My Friend Dahmer Ross Lynch as a young Jeffrey Dahmer Credit: FilmRise \nB efore Jeffrey Dahmer came to fame as the \"Milwaukee Cannibal\" he was your average off-beat high schooler. Just ask his classmate John Backderf, whose graphic novel became the basis for Marc Meyers's film. Intentionally given the feel of a Napoleon Dynamite imitator, the movie's dark but humorous tone shifts massively to the former as Dahmer's depraved sexual and social attitudes are awakened. The director deliberately cast the lead role against type to increase the shock-Ross Lynch is most famous for playing a wholesome musician in the Disney show Austin & Ally. 9. Sicilian Ghost Story Credit: Indigo Film \nS icily is not under-represented in Mafia movies, but it has been in fantasy Mafia movies, until now. A young girl searches for her classmate when he disappears near a forest. In reality he's been kidnapped by mobsters, but the girl's search for him takes her through a realm of pure fantasy. It's Pan's Labyrinth via Gomorrah. 10. Wonderstruck Julianne Moore in Wonderstruck Credit: Amazon Studios/Roadside Attraction \nB ased on a novel by the author Brian Selznick, the story takes place in two time periods with seemingly unrelated stories.

Featuring Julianne Moore . 11. Thoroughbreds Credit: Focus Features \nO livia Cooke and Anya Taylor-Joy play Connecticut teenagers Amanda and Lily, who reform their friendship after years apart. One is well-educated and set up in life, the other has become a cynical loner. In spite of these differences they bond again over shared dislikes, including Lily's hatred for her stepfather. But talking things through with him isn't what their re-assessment of the world is building to. \nThe film also features the last screen performance by the late Anton Yelchin as a local criminal whose services are called upon by the pair to assist their plans. 12. Le Redoutable Louis Garrel and Stacy Martin Credit: StudioCanal \nM ichel Hazanavicius (director of The Artist ) has made this film about an eventful period in the life of his compatriot Jean Luc-Godard. The year is 1967 and the Frenchman is in a good place: he has already made a name for himself and he's about to marry the 17-year old actress Anne Wiazemsky (on whose autobiography this film is partly based). The upheavals of 1968 are about to test their relationship however, as will Godard's transformation from an easygoing artist to a politically-driven filmmaker as he sets about producing La Chinoise. 13. Memoir of a Murderer Credit: Showbox/Mediaplex \nM ost people's knowledge of Korean cinema begins and ends with Oldboy, and if you liked that this film won't take you too far from your comfort zone.

Strange , in Barcelona 3 October 2017 \u2022 2:47pm \nA union of Spain\u2019s Guardia Civil called on Tuesday for urgent reinforcements in Catalonia, accusing the government in Madrid of \u201cabandoning\u201d them to \u201charassment\u201d it said had reached the level of ETA\u2019s heyday. \nAmid anger on Catalan streets over the violent police crackdown on Sunday\u2019s banned independence referendum which left almost 900 injured, the Union of Guardia Civil Officers said agents were being \u201charassed, manipulated and vilified by the citizens that they serve\u201d. \nHundreds of National Police and Guardia Civil officers have been forced to abandon Catalan hotels in the face of protests by local residents, while thousands of demonstrators descended on the National Police headquarters in Barcelona on Wednesday. \n\u201cRight now Catalonia is like the Basque Country in 1981,\u201d it said in a blistering statement which claimed they had been \u201cabandoned to their luck\u201d by government \u201cinaction\u201d and \u201cbetrayed\u201d by \u201cdisloyal\u201d Catalan police, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra. \n1981 was a particularly violent period in the Basque conflict and the year of a major crisis in post-dictatorship Spain, which saw an attempted coup by members of the army and Guardia Civil partly in response to the intensifying ETA offensive during the transition to democracy.

But ministers have not blinked, and on Tuesday it was reported that the two cruise liners housing officers in the port of Barcelona had extended their stay until October 11. \nThe Guardia Civil union, however, said the government must \u201clook after them, or pull them out\u201d. \n\"The lamentable incidents that right now are taking place in Catalonia, where the forces and bodies of state security are surrounded in hotels, abandoned to their luck, betrayed by some disloyal Mossos d'Esquadra, encouraged by politicians (that are) TRAITORS to the state, witnessing live on Whatsapp the lynching of our fellow Guardia Civil, do not leave us any other course than to ask that action is taken, that they are liberated, that they are reinforced, that they are assisted, that decisions are taken,\u201d the union said. Firefighters protest in Barcelona amid a general strike called in Catalonia, Spain Credit: ALEJANDRO GARCIA/EFE \nN ational Police unions too called protests outside the force\u2019s stations across Spain, with five organizations calling on the Spanish Interior Ministry to enact \u201curgent and effective measures\u201d to guarantee officers\u2019 security in Catalonia. \nIn a joint statement, they demanded ministers \u201cstop passing the buck\u201d and \u201cback with actions, not words, the work of the only officials who in this moment are maintaining the rule of law in Catalonia\u201d. \nThe interior minister, Juan Ignacio Zoido, called a crisis meeting, insisting he would take \u201call necessary measures to halt the intolerable harassment\u201d of security forces. \nThe National Police also rounded on the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra, which has drawn heavy criticism from national authorities for failing to take a hardline approach to Sunday\u2019s vote. Catalan Independence supporters celebrate as '90pc of voters' say yes 01:13 \nT he unions claimed: \u201cthe work of the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra \u2026 remains dominated by inaction, laxness, neutrality and the aversion to the fulfillment of their legal obligations\u201d. \nPolice forces including the Mossos had received judicial orders to close polling stations and prevent voting, but \"without affecting the normal coexistence of the citizens\". \nThe Catalan force, citing public safety, took a hands-off approach, which national security forces allege forced the crackdown that has drawn opprobrium from around the world. Alarmingly, in several instances, disagreements between the Catalan and national officers also erupted into physical aggression.

Deutsche Bank has signed a new 25-year commitment to office space in London, but not all EU banks have been quite so on the ball after the Brexit vote Credit: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images \nE U banks also provide around 10pc of the corporate lending used by companies in Britain, so securing a continuation of their services in the UK is valuable for domestic purposes too. \n\u201cThe risk of disruption to wholesale UK banking services appeared to be slightly higher than previously thought, given that a number of European Economic Area (EEA) firms branching into the UK were not sufficiently focused on addressing this issue,\u201d said the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) in the record of its latest meeting. \n\u201cAbsent an appropriate agreement in place at the point of exit, EEA firms branching into the UK would need to apply for new authorisations from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in order to continue to carry out regulated activities here.\u201d \nThose banks need to start their applications before the end of the first quarter of 2018, and the Bank is pushing them to do so: \u201cThe PRA was engaging firms to improve the state of their contingency planning.\u201d \nLast week the PRA\u2019s boss Sam Woods said he expected that around 130 banks would need to apply for licences to continue operating in the UK. Sam Woods said he expects around 130 EU banks will need to apply Credit: Jonathan Brady/PA \nO fficials are also concerned about the future of cross-border insurance after Brexit, as well as the implications for companies that send personal data across borders. \n\u201cLoss of authorisation could affect firms\u2019 ability to continue to collect premiums and pay out on claims on outstanding insurance contracts, which in some cases extend for several years,\u201d the FPC said. \n\u201cFirms also lacked robust contingency plans to mitigate risks to financial service provision from possible barriers to the flow of personal data between the UK and EU27. Many firms currently relied on datacentres located in the United Kingdom to provide financial services across Europe.\u201d \nThis can be resolved only if the EU and the UK come to an agreement on operations across borders, the Bank of England said. \n\u201cThe continued free flow of personal data would require the United Kingdom and EU27 to recognise each other\u2019s data protection regimes as \u2018adequate\u2019,\u201d the FPC said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:25:01.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ec562c22b35abc90f928388789ac88b3db8d992", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROXzNkIHJ1sm_qYU7NNHmuObxYv_RI.GV9WdNBS3FRmbmt7WDor28sL2avMMYetlmlvu1K1CgG03xpkJdTkvijm1SLmBU4tXA4LKzr6s7QqIO5B9dt4q6DvU-", "site_full": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "site": "telegraph.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "News", "title": "Sending naked pictures is now a hallmark of society, judge says", "title_full": "Sending naked pictures is now a hallmark of society, judge says", "published": "2017-10-03T23:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000142481230-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq92J3RQrJ_bUK_KIjp4kjzvY2cpKVHENjCBx4PcDaMKw.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 317, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 17, "comments": 0, "shares": 17}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6ec562c22b35abc90f928388789ac88b3db8d992", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROXzNkIHJ1sm_qYU7NNHmuObxYv_RI.GV9WdNBS3FRmbmt7WDor28sL2avMMYetlmlvu1K1CgG03xpkJdTkvijm1SLmBU4tXA4LKzr6s7QqIO5B9dt4q6DvU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Leon Watson", "published": "2017-10-03T23:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sending naked pictures is now a hallmark of society, judge says", "text": "A judge declared sending naked pictures to prospective partners is now a \"hallmark of society\" as he jailed a man for repeatedly sending revenge porn .\nDaniel Stainton, 26, of Cheltenham, admitted blackmailing three young women who sent him naked pictures of themselves after meeting him on social media.\nPassing sentence, Judge Jamie Tabor QC said: \"Whatever trust these ladies had in men has disappeared, unsurprisingly.\n\"It is a hallmark of our society now that young women and sometimes young men - and sometimes mature people - exchange such photographs. All well and good.\n\"But what people do not appear to appreciate is that these images are not gone in a moment - they can hang around, as we can see in this case, for years.\n\"There came a time in your life when you were hard up for money and decided to embark on this campaign of blackmail.

You had no regard at all for your victims.\"\nWhat you need to know | Revenge porn T he court heard one of the victims paid him almost \u00a31,000 not to go public with the intimate pictures of herself, Gloucester Crown Court was told.\nStainton, who pleaded guilty to disclosing private sexual photographs with intent to cause distress, was jailed for five years and three months.\nRichard Posner, prosecuting, said all three victims were left feeling \"degraded, humiliated and traumatised\".\nMr Posner told the court the blackmailing went on over a 12 week period from December 2016 to February this year.\n\"His actions showed evidence of planning by the retention of these intimate images and a degree of targeting. The impact of his crimes on his victims is significant,\" Mr Posner said.\nIt is a hallmark of our society now that young women and sometimes young men - and sometimes mature people - exchange such photographs. All well and good Judge Jamie Tabor QC \"He seems to have been motivated by greed, which demonstrates a high level of deviancy and manipulation.\"\nV ictim A was a 26-year-old shop worker from Cheltenham who met Stainton in 2012 and thought he was a \"nice guy, a shoulder to cry on\" when her marriage started to break down, Mr Posner said.\n\"From March 2013 they became close. She sent him two photos of herself naked via WhatsApp. She then decided to leave her husband for the defendant - but he immediately sent her husband a text telling him that she had been cheating on him.\n\"She says this broke her heart and she lost all contact with the defendant.\"\nThen in 2016 he contacted her on Instagram, using a different name and asking to be a friend. She accepted. But he then sent her four photographs of women, one of them the intimate shot of herself.\n\"When she contacted the defendant he claimed the message was nothing to do with him and that he had lost the phone with her pictures on it.\" said the prosecutor.\n\"On 31st December last year he contacted her from yet another Instagram account, threatening that unless she paid him \u00a3400 he had pictures that she would not want her husband to see. She called the defendant again and he still denied it was him.\n\"She said she would call the police and the Instagram account he had used was then deleted. She never gave in to the demands and lost no money.\"\nMr Posner said Victim B was a 21 year old sales assistant in Scotland.\n\"She started to chat online with the defendant towards the end of October 2016 and she sent him intimate photographs. One was topless.\n\"They exchanged about five or six naked images. She sent them through Snapchat. Unknown to her, the defendant took screenshots of these images before they disappeared.\n\"We say he was collecting these images to exploit her later if he decided to do so. Last December he contacted her and demanded money or he would post the pictures online if she didn't pay him.\n\"For two months he extorted money from her. He said he would send the pictures to her family and friends if she did not pay.\n\"On 7th December she paid him \u00a3200. On 16th December she paid another \u00a3175. On 16th January this year she paid \u00a3200. On 8th February she paid him \u00a3300.\n\"The defendant continue to ask for more money and she then reported him to the police. He then posted an intimate picture of her naked on her timeline on Facebook but fortunately she was able to delete it immediately.\"\nVictim C, now in her early twenties, was only 15 when she was first in contact with Stainton on Facebook sometime before 2011, Mr Poster said.\n\"They chatted online and exchanged numbers. After several months he asked for a naked picture of herself. She was not comfortable with that. He asked for a topless picture instead.\n\"Under some pressure she sent him one but her head was not in the photograph. \"\nWhen Stainton was jailed in July 2011 for dishonesty offences he called the girl and told her - and then started writing to her from prison, the prosecutor said.\n\"He asked for more topless photographs but she declined. On 22nd January this year, using an Instagram account called 'Culture&Cars', he told her to bring \u00a3300 in cash and to leave it in an envelope under a bin in a park or he would upload the topless image.\n\"The young lady was left scared, wondering how many other people would see it. She told her parents. They decided to call the police. \"\nStainton has seven previous criminal convictions for 19 offences, added Mr Posner.\nStainton's Scottish victim said in a statement: \"He threatened to expose my photographs on social media to all my friends and family. I was terrified by this blackmail.\n\"I borrowed money to pay his demands. I had suicidal thoughts. I need to take time off work. I was left broken. He just didn't seem to care. He was just wanting money. I felt worthless.\"\nA statement from Victim A said she felt nauseous when she received the blackmail demand and she was \"shaking and crying\".\nMr Posner said: \"This has left her feeling degraded and humiliated. It has triggered panic attacks. She suffers nightmares.\n\"She states 'This person is has completely destroyed my confidence in people.\"\nVictim C stated: \"This has made me feel depressed, self-conscious and anxious. I am scared to go out because because I feel ashamed. I was betrayed by someone I classed as a friend who I thought I could trust.\"\nWilliam Rose, defending, said: \"There is nothing I can say which excuses or justifies his behaviour. The best mitigation I have is that he has pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.\n\"He has written letters, one addressed to Your Honour and three to the victims. He would like them to know he is genuinely sorry.\n\"It was all down to money and his desperation to try to retain his accommodation. He had arrears of rent and was facing eviction.

Shares in the firm have fallen 70pc since its London listing in 2013, with the group rattled by a plunge in commodity prices as well as a fall in African currencies against the dollar.

Sixteen. You can be very proud of all of your people,\u201d he said. \nDoctors, however, warn that significant numbers of people are at now risk of dying from treatable diseases because they cannot access their routine prescriptions.\nThere is also growing concern about the spread of disease on an island which still is largely without power, a fortnight after Hurricane Maria hit, and where mountain communities remain flooded and largely cut off.\nMr Trump visited the affluent district of Guaynabo, telling a family who showed him their damaged home to \u201chave a good time\u201d, before heading to a community centre distributing aid, where he tossed rolls of toilet paper into the crowd.\nPuerto Rican radio talk shows were dominated by discussion of Mr Trump's throwing of paper towels.

But now the college\u2019s council has approved an update to its entry criteria, stating that it will accept any student \u201cwho at the point of application identifies as a woman\u201d.\nThe college, whose alumni include Sue Perkins, Claudia Winkelman and Tilda Swinton, states on its website that \u201cwith so much gender inequality still in the world there is a role for a College able to focus on outstanding young women, their learning and skills for life.\"\nThe change was made after a motion on transgender was passed by the College Council, a group of academics and teaching fellows.\nIn a statement published after the vote, the council stated that it has \u201csympathy with the idea that gender is not binary\u201d and that \u201cnarrow gender identities\u201d are damaging to \u201cwider society\u201d.\nIts statement adds: \u201cIn relation to current students, we consider each case on an individual basis, focusing on what is in the best interests of that individual, in full discussion with that student.\n\u201cShould the student decide that they would prefer to be in a mixed college if transitioning to male or if rejecting a binary gender category, the College would be fully supportive of a transfer.\u201d\nThe decision has raised questions about the purpose of the College, which was founded to address gender imbalances at Cambridge University, which at the time had the lowest proportion of women undergraduates of any university in Britain.\nClaudia Winkleman studied at Murray Edwards College, Cambridge Credit: BBC G ermaine Greer, a leading feminist and former lecturer at Newnham College, has described the decision as \u201cridiculous\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a silly situation, and I\u2019m sure that Murray Edwards will have their own reasons,\u201d she told The Daily Telegraph.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a difficult relationship, having a transgender person in an all-female environment. \u201cIf [Murray Edwards] really don\u2019t believe that gender is binary, then they really shouldn\u2019t be a single sex college. Their position is ridiculous. The only sane thing for them to do is to cease discriminating on the basis of assigned gender of any kind.\n\u201cThere are plenty of women who have served their time in women\u2019s colleges, who are pretty whiskery, but nobody did a DNA test on them. But they had to live women\u2019s lives - with all the disabilities that that entails.\u201d\nMurray Edwards College D r Joanna Williams of the University of Kent said that the decision marked the \u201cend of women-only spaces\u201d.\n\u201cThis college was set up several decades ago when things were very different for female students,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIf some women want to have a women-only space, if they choose to be there, they should have every right to do that.\n\u201cTo then learn that you\u2019re sharing your dormitory, your bathroom with someone who is biologically male is an infringement on your right to choose the right the educational environment you chose.\u201d\nMurray Edwards College used to be called New Hall A cademics from the college defended the move, saying it does not challenge the College\u2019s single-sex status but is a recognition of the fact that \"how we define women is changing\".\nJuliet Foster, a senior tutor at Murray Edwards, said: \u201cOur position is very clear: we want to be open to all outstanding young women, and we felt that society is changing and there is greater understanding of the complexities surrounding gender.\n\u201cWe felt that was therefore in line with our values to accept all women, including transgender people who identify as female.\"\nTilda Swinton studied at Murray Edwards College Credit: Rex Features D ame Barbara Stocking, President of Murray Edwards, added: \u201cSociety is changing and there is now a greater understanding of the complexities of gender.\n\"In order that we remain true to our mission of being open to all outstanding young women we recognise that it is right for anyone who identifies as female, regardless of their born gender, to be able to apply to study with us.\"\nKate Litman, women\u2019s officer at Murray Edwards, said that students are \u201cthrilled\u201d with the change of policy. \u201cWe recognise many women still experience environments where their achievements are not recognised or their voice is not heard,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMurray Edwards fosters an environment which celebrates women and encourages us to reach our potential, and it is absolutely right that all women should have the chance to study here, no matter what gender they were assigned at birth.\"\nCelia Macleod, chair of the Gender Identity Research and Education Society (GIRES), a charity that supports people who are transgender or do not conform to a particular gender, said she welcomes the decision \u201cto respect and support all gender diverse people\u201d.\nMurray Edwards, which was founded in 1954 and used to be called New Hall, is one of three all-women\u2019s colleges at Cambridge University and is the first to make such a change to its admissions policy.\nAt the university\u2019s other women-only colleges, Newnham and Lucy Cavendish, any application must be recognised under the Gender Recognition Act.", "highlightText": "",

The range of passive funds will be expanded, said Fidelity, to meet growing investor demand for low-cost vehicles. \nThe performance fee means that where a fund manager beats the relevant benchmark the firm takes a share of the profits, although the precise charge mechanism not been revealed. \nThe performance fee will be taken even if the fund manager loses money. For example, if the benchmark falls by 10pc and the fund by 8pc it will be deemed to have \"outperformed\" and the fee will be triggered. \nHowever, if the fund manager delivers lower returns than the market it will hand back some of the costs, to compensate investors for some of their losses. \nFidelity said both a cap and a floor would apply to the new charges, full details of which will be revealed at the start of next year. \nInvestors will also not be forced to change to the new charging structure, and can remain on the existing fee system - although they will see a slight increase in the annual management charge. \nFidelity is a major provider of investment funds to individual savers via Isas and pensions. Its announcement was not universally welcomed, however, with some warning that it would bewilder investors and others critical of the performance-based model. \nDarius McDermott, of Chealsea Financial Services, the broker, said: \"It is hard to say this is the best thing since sliced bread, but what it will do is give more choice. \n\"Choice is good, and Fidelity is trying to be innovative but so far this is as clear as mud and is going to lead to further confusion.\" \nLaith Khalaf, of Hargreaves Lansdown, Britain's biggest distributor of investment funds, said that performance fees have a chequered past. \n\"Fees like this can work, but we have in the past seen performance fees that don\u2019t act in clients' favour. A lot of it comes down to specifics of what the charges will be, what the benchmark is going to be, and how often the fee is calculated,\" he said. \n\"It adds complexity and so makes fund comparisons more difficult for investors. Generally speaking we prefer simpler, lower annual management charges,\" Mr Khalaf said. investment fees calculator Who else charges performance fees? \nN eil Woodford's Patient Capital investment trust is one of the few large funds that charges a performance fee. \nHowever, it charges no annual management fee and must deliver annual performance of more than 10pc before it takes the performance fee. If it reaches this level the asset manager will take 15pc of the outperformance. \nSince launch in April 2015, the fund has failed to meet its performance target - and so no fee has been paid. \nThe use by fund firms of performance fees surged between 2007 and 2010, after a ban on them by the regulators was lifted. \nComprehensive research by data firm Lipper in 2012 found that funds charging a performance fee did not substantially outperform those that charged a flat fee. \nThe data firm also discovered that a number of funds with performance fees had chosen to revert to a flat fee, or had closed.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hargreaves lansdown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony bolton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darius mcdermott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laith khalaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khalaf", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fidelity", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chealsea financial services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fidelity uk special situations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lipper", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woodford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:10:28.012+03:00"}], "totalResults": 8678, "moreResultsAvailable": 8578, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=1eee5ef1-4d51-497e-9e88-ed86353bcda9&format=json&ts=1507043428012&q=language%3Aenglish+site%3Atelegraph.co.uk&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 755}
