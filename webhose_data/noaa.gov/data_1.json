However, watch issuance is unlikely. DISCUSSION...Satellite observations show developing cumulus along a northeast-oriented surface boundary and triple point located in Guadalupe County, NM. Here, strong moisture convergence is occurring, with surface dew points in the mid 60s south of the boundary. Should storms form in this area, MLCAPE of 1000-1500 J/kg and effective bulk shear of 45-50 kt should support supercell thunderstorms capable of producing hail and localized strong winds. Farther west, diurnal heating and upslope flow along the Sacramento Mountains is helping to initiate thunderstorms. Here, MLCAPE of 500-1000 J/kg and effective bulk shear of 45-50 kt should be conducive for supercells, especially if storms can move off the high terrain into the richer axis of moisture displaced about a county to the east. However, storms in the region are expected to remain isolated, precluding the need for a watch at this time. ..Karstens/Thompson.. 10/03/2017 ...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...

Interests along the southern coast of Mexico should monitor the progress of Ramon. DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ramon was located near latitude 14.3 North, longitude 96.0 West. Ramon is moving toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion with some increase in forward speed is expected over the next day or two. On the forecast track, the center of Ramon is expected to move parallel to but remain offshore of the coast of southern Mexico. Satellite wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next couple of days. Ramon is a small tropical storm. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) primarily to the west and southwest of the center. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND RAINFALL: Ramon is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches over the Mexican states of Oaxaca and coastal Guerrero through Thursday. This rainfall could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. WIND: Strong gusty winds could occur along portions of the southern coast of Mexico between Puerto Angel and Acapulco during the next day or so.

Although the convection is confined to the western portion of the circulation due to strong easterly shear, it has enough organization for the system to be classify as a tropical cyclone. Scatterometer data from 0410 UTC revealed a small area of 35-40 kt winds to the west of the center, so advisories are being initiated on a 40-kt tropical storm, the seventeenth tropical storm of the 2017 eastern Pacific hurricane season. Strong easterly shear is forecast to persist over Ramon during the next during the next few days, which is likely to prevent strengthening of the small tropical storm. The ECMWF and GFS weaken the cyclone over the next day or so, although both models show some interaction with another disturbance farther west in a couple of days. The NHC forecast is of low confidence and calls for no change in strength throughout the forecast period. An alternate scenario is for Ramon to move closer to the coast of Mexico and dissipate within the next 2-3 days. Ramon is moving westward or 270/8 kt to the south of a deep layer ridge over the northern Gulf of Mexico. The ridge is forecast to build westward over northern Mexico during the next few days, which should cause Ramon to move westward at a slightly faster forward speed. Later in the period, Ramon is forecast to reach the western portion of the ridge and turn northwestward. Although most of the model guidance agrees with this general scenario, there is a fair amount of spread in the track models. The GFS and HWRF show a faster westward motion while the ECMWF is much slower. The UKMET is the outlier by taking Ramon eastward toward central America as a low pressure area develops over the western Caribbean. Given the large spread in the guidance, the NHC track forecast shows a slower westward track and is close to the GFS and ECMWF ensemble means. The confidence in the track forecast is quite low and interests along the southern coast of Mexico should monitor the progress of this system.

The orange circle indicates the current position of the center of the tropical cyclone. The black line, when selected, and dots show the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast track of the center at the times indicated. The dot indicating the forecast center location will be black if the cyclone is forecast to be tropical and will be white with a black outline if the cyclone is forecast to be extratropical. If only an L is displayed, then the system is forecast to be a remnant low. The letter inside the dot indicates the NHC's forecast intensity for that time: D : Tropical Depression \u2013 wind speed less than 39 MPH S : Tropical Storm \u2013 wind speed between 39 MPH and 73 MPH H : Hurricane \u2013 wind speed between 74 MPH and 110 MPH M : Major Hurricane \u2013 wind speed greater than 110 MPH NHC tropical cyclone forecast tracks can be in error. This forecast uncertainty is conveyed by the track forecast \"cone\", the solid white and stippled white areas in the graphic. The solid white area depicts the track forecast uncertainty for days 1-3 of the forecast, while the stippled area depicts the uncertainty on days 4-5. Historical data indicate that the entire 5-day path of the center of the tropical cyclone will remain within the cone about 60-70% of the time. To form the cone, a set of imaginary circles are placed along the forecast track at the 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h positions, where the size of each circle is set so that it encloses 67% of the previous five years official forecast errors. The cone is then formed by smoothly connecting the area swept out by the set of circles. It is also important to realize that a tropical cyclone is not a point. Their effects can span many hundreds of miles from the center. The area experiencing hurricane force (one-minute average wind speeds of at least 74 mph) and tropical storm force (one-minute average wind speeds of 39-73 mph) winds can extend well beyond the white areas shown enclosing the most likely track area of the center. The distribution of hurricane and tropical storm force winds in this tropical cyclone can be seen in the Wind History graphic linked above. Considering the combined forecast uncertainties in track, intensity, and size, the chances that any particular location will experience winds of 34 kt (tropical storm force), 50 kt, or 64 kt (hurricane force) from this tropical cyclone are presented in tabular form for selected locations and forecast positions .

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT: There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect. For storm information specific to your area, including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office. DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nate was located near latitude 33.1 North, longitude 87.3 West. The depression is moving toward the north-northeast near 24 mph (39 km/h). A turn toward the northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected during the next couple of days. On the forecast track, Nate's center will continue to move inland across the Deep South, Tennessee Valley, and central Appalachian Mountains through Monday. Surface observations indicate that the maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. Little change in strength is predicted during the next couple of days, but Nate is forecast to become post-tropical on Monday or Tuesday. The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND WIND: Tropical-storm-force wind gusts are expected over the the Florida Panhandle, and portions of Alabama and Georgia through this afternoon. STORM SURGE: Water levels remain elevated along portions of the northern Gulf coast, but should gradually subside this afternoon. RAINFALL: Nate is expected to produce the following rain accumulations through Monday: East of the Mississippi River from the central Gulf Coast into the Deep South, eastern Tennessee Valley, and southern Appalachians: 3 to 6 inches, max 10 inches. Across the Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians: 2 to 5 inches, max 7 inches. TORNADOES: A couple tornadoes will be possible today, mainly from the Florida Panhandle and eastern Alabama across western and northern Georgia into the western Carolinas. SURF: Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the Gulf of Mexico through this evening. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ramon was located near latitude 14.9 North, longitude 96.5 West. Ramon is moving toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h) and a generally westward motion with some increase in forward speed is expected over the next couple of days. On the forecast track, the center of Ramon is expected to move parallel to, but remain offshore of, the coast of southern Mexico. Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Only slight strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours. Ramon is a small tropical storm. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the center. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND RAINFALL: Ramon is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches over the Mexican states of Oaxaca and coastal Guerrero through Thursday.

However, radar images from Puerto Angel Mexico do depict some rainbands over the western portion of the circulation. The current intensity estimate is held at 40 kt, which is a little above the latest Dvorak estimates. Ramon is experiencing strong easterly shear associated with a large anticyclone centered near the Texas/Mexico border. The dynamical model guidance indicate only a slight lessening of this shear over the next few days, so only slight strengthening seems possible. The official intensity forecast follows the model consensus. The center is difficult to locate, but my best guess of the initial motion is 285/6 kt. A large mid-level ridge to the north of the tropical cyclone is forecast to persist, which should cause a mostly westward track over the next several days. The official forecast is a little to the north of the previous one and roughly in the middle of the track model guidance. There is a fairly large spread in the models so this forecast is of low confidence. Although the center of Ramon is expected to remain offshore, the northward adjustment of the track forecast requires the issuance of a Tropical Storm Watch for a portion of the Mexican coast at this time.

The orange circle indicates the current position of the center of the tropical cyclone. The black line, when selected, and dots show the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast track of the center at the times indicated. The dot indicating the forecast center location will be black if the cyclone is forecast to be tropical and will be white with a black outline if the cyclone is forecast to be extratropical. If only an L is displayed, then the system is forecast to be a remnant low. The letter inside the dot indicates the NHC's forecast intensity for that time: D : Tropical Depression \u2013 wind speed less than 39 MPH S : Tropical Storm \u2013 wind speed between 39 MPH and 73 MPH H : Hurricane \u2013 wind speed between 74 MPH and 110 MPH M : Major Hurricane \u2013 wind speed greater than 110 MPH NHC tropical cyclone forecast tracks can be in error. This forecast uncertainty is conveyed by the track forecast \"cone\", the solid white and stippled white areas in the graphic. The solid white area depicts the track forecast uncertainty for days 1-3 of the forecast, while the stippled area depicts the uncertainty on days 4-5. Historical data indicate that the entire 5-day path of the center of the tropical cyclone will remain within the cone about 60-70% of the time. To form the cone, a set of imaginary circles are placed along the forecast track at the 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h positions, where the size of each circle is set so that it encloses 67% of the previous five years official forecast errors. The cone is then formed by smoothly connecting the area swept out by the set of circles. It is also important to realize that a tropical cyclone is not a point. Their effects can span many hundreds of miles from the center. The area experiencing hurricane force (one-minute average wind speeds of at least 74 mph) and tropical storm force (one-minute average wind speeds of 39-73 mph) winds can extend well beyond the white areas shown enclosing the most likely track area of the center. The distribution of hurricane and tropical storm force winds in this tropical cyclone can be seen in the Wind History graphic linked above. Considering the combined forecast uncertainties in track, intensity, and size, the chances that any particular location will experience winds of 34 kt (tropical storm force), 50 kt, or 64 kt (hurricane force) from this tropical cyclone are presented in tabular form for selected locations and forecast positions .

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area, in this case within the next 12 to 24 hours. DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ramon was located near latitude 15.0 North, longitude 97.0 West. Ramon is moving toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and a general westward motion with some increase in forward speed is expected over the next couple of days. On the forecast track, the center of Ramon is expected to move parallel to, but remain offshore of, the coast of southern Mexico. Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Little change in strength is likely during the next 48 hours. Ramon is a small tropical storm. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)   estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND RAINFALL: Ramon is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches over the Mexican states of Oaxaca and coastal Guerrero through Thursday. This rainfall could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area during the next day or so.

Although the estimated intensity estimate will be held at 40 kt based on a ship report that may or may not be correct, weakening seems likely. Strong easterly shear is forecast by the global models to persist over Ramon for the next couple of days, and most of these models show the tropical cyclone dissipating in 24 to 48 hours. Based on that guidance and the current trends, the official forecast now calls for the system to dissipate in 48 hours, and this event could occur sooner than that. The center, if it still exists, continues to be difficult to locate but the system appears to be moving a little faster toward the west-northwest or 285/8 kt. A large mid-level ridge to the north of Ramon is expected to steer the cyclone on a slightly north of westward track until it dissipates. The official track forecast is somewhat faster than the previous one and lies roughly in the middle of the track model guidance. The primary concern with this system is locally heavy rains, which should occur predominately in the immediate coastal zone of southern Mexico.

Interests elsewhere in Honduras, the Bay Islands, western Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula should monitor the progress of the depression. A hurricane watch could be issued for portions of the Yucatan Peninsula this evening. For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service. DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Sixteen was located near latitude 12.6 North, longitude 82.6 West. The depression is moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this motion is expected to continue tonight. On the forecast track, the depression should be nearing the coast of Nicaragua early Thursday, move across northeastern Nicaragua and eastern Honduras late Thursday, and emerge into the northwestern Caribbean Sea on Friday. Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm overnight. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND RAINFALL: The depression is expected to produce the following rain accumulations through Friday night: Nicaragua...15 to 20 inches, isolated 30 inches Costa Rica and Panama...5 to 10 inches, isolated 20 inches Honduras...2 to 5 inches, isolated 8 inches Heavy rainfall will occur over a wide area, including locations well away from the center along the Pacific coast of Central America. This rainfall could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to start in the warning area in Nicaragua early on Thursday, and spread into Honduras late Thursday. SURF: Swells generated by the cyclone are affecting portions of the coast of Nicaragua, and will begin to affect other land areas around the northwestern Caribbean later this week. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter flew into the depression this afternoon and found a well-defined circulation, with maximum flight-level winds of 37 kt and SFMR values around 30 kt. These data support keeping the intensity at 30 kt for this advisory. Environmental conditions look quite favorable for strengthening over the next few days, with low shear and very warm and deep water in the path of the cyclone. The various rapid intensification indices are all higher than the last cycle, suggesting an increasing chance of rapid intensification occurring. The fly in the ointment, however, is all of the potential land interaction, first over Central America and then possibly over the Yucatan Peninsula. As a compromise, the intensity forecast is raised considerably from the previous one during the first 3 days, but is still below some guidance, such as the HWRF. The depression continues to move slowly northwestward, steered by a distant ridge over the southwestern Atlantic. However the steering pattern is forecast to change quickly tomorrow as a mid-tropospheric trough over the Florida Straits moves across the northwestern Caribbean into the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Southerly flow on the eastern side of that trough should cause the cyclone to move much faster to the north-northwest by Friday and northward into the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday. While there is some agreement on the synoptic pattern, the model track agreement is rather poor, even in the short term, with the GFS and ECMWF being 90 miles apart on the forecast track as soon as 24 hours out. This has profound differences down the road, with the GFS-based guidance moving considerably faster and to the left of the ECMWF and UKMET across the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, the guidance has generally shifted a bit westward since the last cycle, so the latest points in the long range have been adjusted in that direction. At this point, I wouldn't focus too much attention on the details of the long-range forecast until the guidance comes into better agreement. A G-IV mission and Florida special soundings have been set up for tomorrow to better determine the synoptic steering flow around the cyclone. KEY MESSAGES: 1. The depression is forecast to strengthen and bring tropical storm conditions to portions of Nicaragua and Honduras tonight through Friday. Heavy rainfall could produce life-threatening flash flooding and mud slides in portions of Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Panama through Friday night. 2. The system is expected to be near hurricane intensity when it approaches the Yucatan Peninsula late Friday or Saturday, bringing direct impacts from wind, storm surge, and heavy rainfall. A hurricane watch could be issued for this area later this evening. 3. The system is forecast to continue strengthening over the Gulf of Mexico and could affect portions of the northern Gulf Coast as a hurricane this weekend, with direct impacts from wind, storm surge, and heavy rainfall. However, it is too early to specify the timing, location, or magnitude of these impacts. Residents along the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Florida should monitor the progress of this system for the next several days and heed any advice given by local officials.

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Sixteen was located near latitude 12.6 North, longitude 82.6 West. The depression is moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this motion is expected to continue tonight. On the forecast track, the depression should be nearing the coast of Nicaragua early Thursday, move across northeastern Nicaragua and eastern Honduras late Thursday, and emerge into the northwestern Caribbean Sea on Friday. Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm overnight. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND RAINFALL: The depression is expected to produce the following rain accumulations through Friday night: Nicaragua...15 to 20 inches, isolated 30 inches Costa Rica and Panama...5 to 10 inches, isolated 20 inches Honduras...2 to 5 inches, isolated 8 inches Heavy rainfall will occur over a wide area, including locations well away from the center along the Pacific coast of Central America. This rainfall could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to start in the warning area in Nicaragua early on Thursday, and spread into Honduras late Thursday. SURF: Swells generated by the cyclone are affecting portions of the coast of Nicaragua, and will begin to affect other land areas around the northwestern Caribbean later this week. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

Within continued broad cyclonic flow over much of the CONUS, a mid/upper-level jet will overspread the northern/central Plains by Wednesday afternoon. Large-scale lift associated with this jet will encourage a surface low to develop eastward across the northern High Plains through Wednesday evening. A separate surface low will likely form across eastern CO, with lee troughing extending southward from this low across the central/southern High Plains. ...Portions of the Central/Southern High Plains... An elevated area has been introduced for a small portion of the central High Plains for Day 2/Wednesday. Along and east of the Laramie Range in southeastern WY, strong west-northwesterly surface winds will develop as the mid/upper-level jet mentioned previously overspreads this region. Sustained winds of 20-40 mph will be common by Wednesday afternoon, with much stronger gusts of 50-65 mph possible, especially across southeastern WY. A small corridor of lowered RH values should develop across parts of southeastern WY, northeastern CO, and the NE Panhandle as these downslope winds encourage warming/drying of low levels. Consensus of latest guidance suggests RH values may fall as low as the upper teens/20% for a few hours through peak afternoon heating. A lack of recent precipitation has allowed fine fuels to dry enough to support large fire spread, which combined with the expected meteorological conditions is sufficient to warrant a small elevated delineation. Farther south across southeastern CO into the southern High Plains, strong/gusty downslope westerly winds around 15-25 mph are also expected along/behind a lee trough as enhanced mid-level winds move over these regions. However, RH values should become only marginally reduced (generally remaining above 20%), and some prior precipitation from Day 1/Tuesday will likely render most fuels unreceptive to large fire starts. Therefore, no elevated area has been introduced for these areas at this time. ...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov/fire for graphic product...

Severe thunderstorms are not expected the rest of the period. ...Discussion... As a mid-level speed max/vorticity center shifts quickly east across the Tennessee Valley over the next few hours -- i.e. away from the central Gulf Coast region, convection now ongoing over parts of southeast Louisiana/southern Mississippi and vicinity should continue to slowly diminish. With no new lightning strikes observed over the past hour or so, weakening trends observed on radar, evening RAOBS upstream showing minimal if any CAPE, and ascent with the aforementioned mid-level jet sliding east, no more than a few sporadic strikes are expected at this time. Thus, the thunder area over this region is being removed at this time. Farther north, a few lightning strikes have been observed over east-central Illinois and adjacent northwest Indiana, but here too, indications are that lightning coverage will be minimal -- insufficient to introduce a thunder area in this region. ..Goss.. 11/02/2017 CLICK TO GET WUUS01 PTSDY1 PRODUCT NOTE: THE NEXT DAY 1 OUTLOOK IS SCHEDULED BY 0600Z", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "darrow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "vermont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tx south plains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern plains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "high plains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rockies", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T05:48:46.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "adb0db76f0d4f10c104a7108da3abf7d282c47f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rGoBXk0qpHOSRaROsSq88Knb4gV.42ewVcC0FpN_4g6drtfm.JZSszYqfnp5jftMb0TYzJ1iH3GswXYxqjVqP", "site_full": "www.nhc.noaa.gov", "site": "noaa.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/nhc_ep4.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "NHC Eastern North Pacific Wallet 4 - Tropical Depression Ramon (EP192017)", "title": "Tropical Depression Ramon Graphics", "title_full": "Tropical Depression Ramon Graphics", "published": "2017-10-05T05:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1535, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "adb0db76f0d4f10c104a7108da3abf7d282c47f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rGoBXk0qpHOSRaROsSq88Knb4gV.42ewVcC0FpN_4g6drtfm.JZSszYqfnp5jftMb0TYzJ1iH3GswXYxqjVqP", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "nhcwebmaster@noaa.gov (NHC Webmaster)", "published": "2017-10-05T05:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tropical Depression Ramon Graphics", "text": "On Off * If the storm is forecast to dissipate within 3 days, the \"Full Forecast\" and \"3 day\" graphic will be identical About this product: This graphic shows an approximate representation of coastal areas under a hurricane warning (red), hurricane watch (pink), tropical storm warning (blue) and tropical storm watch (yellow). The orange circle indicates the current position of the center of the tropical cyclone. The black line, when selected, and dots show the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast track of the center at the times indicated. The dot indicating the forecast center location will be black if the cyclone is forecast to be tropical and will be white with a black outline if the cyclone is forecast to be extratropical. If only an L is displayed, then the system is forecast to be a remnant low. The letter inside the dot indicates the NHC's forecast intensity for that time: D : Tropical Depression \u2013 wind speed less than 39 MPH S : Tropical Storm \u2013 wind speed between 39 MPH and 73 MPH H : Hurricane \u2013 wind speed between 74 MPH and 110 MPH M : Major Hurricane \u2013 wind speed greater than 110 MPH NHC tropical cyclone forecast tracks can be in error. This forecast uncertainty is conveyed by the track forecast \"cone\", the solid white and stippled white areas in the graphic. The solid white area depicts the track forecast uncertainty for days 1-3 of the forecast, while the stippled area depicts the uncertainty on days 4-5. Historical data indicate that the entire 5-day path of the center of the tropical cyclone will remain within the cone about 60-70% of the time. To form the cone, a set of imaginary circles are placed along the forecast track at the 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h positions, where the size of each circle is set so that it encloses 67% of the previous five years official forecast errors. The cone is then formed by smoothly connecting the area swept out by the set of circles. It is also important to realize that a tropical cyclone is not a point. Their effects can span many hundreds of miles from the center. The area experiencing hurricane force (one-minute average wind speeds of at least 74 mph) and tropical storm force (one-minute average wind speeds of 39-73 mph) winds can extend well beyond the white areas shown enclosing the most likely track area of the center. The distribution of hurricane and tropical storm force winds in this tropical cyclone can be seen in the Wind History graphic linked above. Considering the combined forecast uncertainties in track, intensity, and size, the chances that any particular location will experience winds of 34 kt (tropical storm force), 50 kt, or 64 kt (hurricane force) from this tropical cyclone are presented in tabular form for selected locations and forecast positions .

Earlier ASCAT data indicated the formation of a new center under convection well to the west, and this has probably become the primary center, if one still exists. As a result, the initial position of Ramon has been adjusted significantly to the west. Whatever remains of Ramon will likely be steered generally westward by a mid-level ridge centered over northern Mexico. Since most of the track guidance no longer depicts a trackable low-level center, the new NHC track forecast follows the trend of the previous advisory, in an effort to maintain some continuity. Therefore, the forecast shows a continued westward motion with a slight increase in forward speed until the cyclone dissipates, in 24 hours or less. Dvorak classifications have decreased and Ramon is now estimated to be a 30 kt tropical depression. All of the dynamical models forecast that Ramon will dissipate quickly, and in fact the most recent runs of the ECMWF and UKMET suggest that only a trough should exist now. There is some indication from the GFS and the GFS-based hurricane models that the mid-level remnants of Ramon could interact with a disturbance to the west in a day or two and regenerate, or contribute to the development of a new tropical cyclone. However, this is not supported by any of the other global models, and 30 kt or more of shear should prohibit significant redevelopment. Even if Ramon dissipates later tonight or tomorrow, locally heavy rainfall is still expected along the immediate coast of southern Mexico through Thursday.

The depression is moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h). A continued westward motion with an increase in forward speed is expected for the next day or two. On the forecast track, Ramon will continue moving away from the southern coast of Mexico tonight and on Thursday. Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. The depression is expected to dissipate within the next 24 hours. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND RAINFALL: Ramon is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 5 inches over the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, and southern Michoacan through Thursday, with heaviest amounts occurring near the coast. This rainfall could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

The orange circle indicates the current position of the center of the tropical cyclone. The black line, when selected, and dots show the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast track of the center at the times indicated. The dot indicating the forecast center location will be black if the cyclone is forecast to be tropical and will be white with a black outline if the cyclone is forecast to be extratropical. If only an L is displayed, then the system is forecast to be a remnant low. The letter inside the dot indicates the NHC's forecast intensity for that time: D : Tropical Depression \u2013 wind speed less than 39 MPH S : Tropical Storm \u2013 wind speed between 39 MPH and 73 MPH H : Hurricane \u2013 wind speed between 74 MPH and 110 MPH M : Major Hurricane \u2013 wind speed greater than 110 MPH NHC tropical cyclone forecast tracks can be in error. This forecast uncertainty is conveyed by the track forecast \"cone\", the solid white and stippled white areas in the graphic. The solid white area depicts the track forecast uncertainty for days 1-3 of the forecast, while the stippled area depicts the uncertainty on days 4-5. Historical data indicate that the entire 5-day path of the center of the tropical cyclone will remain within the cone about 60-70% of the time. To form the cone, a set of imaginary circles are placed along the forecast track at the 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h positions, where the size of each circle is set so that it encloses 67% of the previous five years official forecast errors. The cone is then formed by smoothly connecting the area swept out by the set of circles. It is also important to realize that a tropical cyclone is not a point. Their effects can span many hundreds of miles from the center. The area experiencing hurricane force (one-minute average wind speeds of at least 74 mph) and tropical storm force (one-minute average wind speeds of 39-73 mph) winds can extend well beyond the white areas shown enclosing the most likely track area of the center. The distribution of hurricane and tropical storm force winds in this tropical cyclone can be seen in the Wind History graphic linked above.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT: A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for... * Sandy Bay Sirpi Nicaragua to Punta Castilla Honduras A Hurricane Watch is in effect for... * Punta Herrero to Rio Lagartos Mexico A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area. A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area. A watch is typically issued 48 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous. Interests elsewhere in Honduras, the Bay Islands, western Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula should monitor the progress of Nate. For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service. DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nate was located near latitude 13.9 North, longitude 83.4 West. Nate is moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this motion is expected to continue this morning. A north-northwestward motion at a faster forward speed is forecast to begin later today and continue through Friday night. On the forecast track, the center of Nate should move across northeastern Nicaragua and eastern Honduras today and then over the northwestern Caribbean Sea tonight and Friday. The center is expected to approach the coast of the Yucatan peninsula late Friday. Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Little change in strength is expected today as the center of Nate moves across northeastern Nicaragua and eastern Honduras. Strengthening is likely over the northwestern Caribbean Sea tonight and Friday. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) mainly over water to the east of the center. The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches). Puerto Cabezas recently reported a pressure of 1001 mb (29.56 inches) HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND RAINFALL: Nate is expected to produce the following rain accumulations through Friday night: Nicaragua...15 to 20 inches, isolated 30 inches Costa Rica and Panama...5 to 10 inches, isolated 20 inches Honduras and Belize...2 to 5 inches, isolated 8 inches Eastern portions of the Yucatan peninsula...4 to 8 inches, isolated 12 inches Heavy rainfall will occur over a wide area, including locations well away from the center along the Pacific coast of Central America. This rainfall could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within portions of the warning area in Nicaragua and Honduras today and tonight. Tropical storm and hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in Mexico beginning late Friday. SURF: Swells generated by Nate are affecting portions of the coast of Nicaragua, and will begin to affect other land areas around the northwestern Caribbean later this week. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

Subjective Dvorak intensity estimates suggest that the depression is near tropical-storm strength, but with the center located near the western edge of the deep convection the cyclone is kept as a 30-kt tropical depression for this advisory. The intensity forecast remains quite uncertain due to expected land interaction today, and possibly again in about 48 hours when the system passes near the Yucatan peninsula. The depression could still become a tropical storm before the center moves over northeastern Nicaragua and eastern Honduras later today. After the cyclone moves north of Honduras, it will traverse the warm waters of the northwestern Caribbean Sea, where the upper-level environment is also forecast to be conducive for strengthening. However, the amount of strengthening is likely to depend on the structure of the inner core after it crosses land. The intensity models have continued their downward trend, but the NHC forecast remains near the higher side of the guidance due to these favorable conditions and persistence from the previous advisory. Some additional strengthening is possible while the system moves over the southern and central Gulf of Mexico, and the NHC intensity forecast brings the system to hurricane strength within 72 hours. This is in best agreement with the SHIPS intensity model. The depression is moving northwestward or 315/6 kt. The cyclone is forecast to move northwestward to north-northwestward during the next day or two around the western side of a ridge the extends from near the southeastern Bahamas southwestward into the central Caribbean Sea. By the weekend, a large mid- to upper-level ridge is forecast to build off the coast of the southeastern United States, and this should steer the cyclone north-northwestward at a faster forward speed. After 72 hours, the system is expected to recurve around the northwestward side of the ridge. The track guidance is in better agreement this cycle with the latest runs of the ECMWF and UKMET models shifting westward, closer to the previous GFS and HWRF iterations. This has required a fairly substantial westward shift in the NHC forecast track at 72 h and beyond. KEY MESSAGES: 1. The depression is forecast to strengthen and bring tropical storm conditions to portions of Nicaragua and Honduras through early Friday. Heavy rainfall could produce life-threatening flash flooding and mud slides in portions of Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Panama through Friday night. 2. The system could be near hurricane intensity when it approaches the Yucatan Peninsula late Friday, bringing direct impacts from wind, storm surge, and heavy rainfall, and a hurricane watch is in effect for a portion of this area. 3. The system is forecast to strengthen over the Gulf of Mexico and could affect portions of the northern Gulf Coast as a hurricane this weekend, with direct impacts from wind, storm surge, and heavy rainfall.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT: A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for... * Sandy Bay Sirpi Nicaragua to Punta Castilla Honduras * Punta Herrero to Rio Lagartos Mexico A Hurricane Watch is in effect for... * Punta Herrero to Rio Lagartos Mexico A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area. A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area. Interests elsewhere in Honduras, the Bay Islands, western Cuba, the Yucatan Peninsula, and the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of Nate. For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service. DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nate was located inland over northeastern Nicaragua near latitude 14.5 North, longitude 84.0 West. Nate is moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h). A turn toward the north-northwest at a faster forward speed is expected this afternoon or tonight, with that motion continuing through Friday night. On the forecast track, the center of Nate should move across northeastern Nicaragua and eastern Honduras this afternoon and then over the northwestern Caribbean Sea tonight and Friday. The center is expected to approach the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula late Friday. Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Little change in strength is expected today while the center is over land. Strengthening is likely once the center moves over the northwestern Caribbean Sea tonight and Friday. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (80 km) mainly over water to the east of the center. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND RAINFALL: Nate is expected to produce the following rain accumulations through Friday night: Nicaragua...15 to 20 inches, isolated 30 inches Costa Rica and Panama...5 to 10 inches, isolated 20 inches Honduras and Eastern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula...4 to 8 inches, isolated 12 inches Belize...2 to 5 inches, isolated 8 inches Heavy rainfall will occur over a wide area, including locations well away from the center along the Pacific coast of Central America. Rainfall across all of these areas may produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within portions of the warning area in Nicaragua and Honduras today and tonight. Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in Mexico Friday night, with tropical storm conditions expected by late Friday. SURF: Swells generated by Nate are affecting portions of the coast of Nicaragua, and will begin to affect other land areas around the northwestern Caribbean during the next day or two. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

In addition, data from the Colombian radar at San Andres showed a partial eyewall, and surface observations from Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, included a pressure of 1001 mb outside of the center. Based on these data, the initial intensity has been increased to 35 kt, and the depression has been upgraded to Tropical Storm Nate. The center of Nate is now inland over northeastern Nicaragua, and little change in strength is expected until the center moves over the northwestern Caribbean Sea. After that, a combination of warm sea surface temperatures and light shear should allow for at least steady strengthening. However, the guidance is producing mixed signals despite a favorable-looking environment. The Rapid Intensification Index of the SHIPS model is showing high chances of rapid intensification, with better than a 50 percent chance of 25 kt of strengthening in the next 24 h and nearly a 50 percent chance of 65 kt of strengthening in 72 h. On the other side, the GFS and Canadian models show only modest development and keep the cyclone as a tropical storm until it reaches the northern Gulf coast. Given the environment, the intensity forecast leans towards the high end of the guidance envelope and calls for Nate to become a hurricane in about 48 h and reach the northern Gulf Coast as a hurricane. The initial motion is 325/8. A combination of a large cyclonic gyre over Central America, a trough of low pressure moving westward across the Gulf of Mexico, and a building subtropical ridge over the western Atlantic should steer Nate generally north-northwestward with an increase in forward speed during the next 72 h. While the guidance is in better agreement on the direction that Nate should move, there remains disagreement on the speed despite an overall trend toward a faster motion. The new forecast track is similar to the direction of the previous track, but shows a faster forward speed that has the center near the northeastern Yucatan Peninsula in about 36 h and near the northern Gulf Coast in about 72 h. After the Gulf Coast landfall, Nate or its remnants are expected to recurve northeastward upon encountering the mid-latitude westerlies. KEY MESSAGES: 1. Heavy rainfall is the main threat from Nate in portions of Central America, with life-threatening flash flooding and mud slides possible in portions of Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, and Belize through Friday night. 2. Nate is forecast to be near hurricane intensity when it approaches the Yucatan Peninsula late Friday, bringing direct impacts from wind, storm surge, and heavy rainfall. A tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch are in effect for a portion of this area and life-threatening flash flooding is also possible. 3. Nate is forecast to reach the northern Gulf Coast this weekend as a hurricane, and the threat of direct impacts from wind, storm surge, and heavy rainfall is increasing. However, it is too early to specify the exact timing, location, or magnitude of these impacts. Residents along the Gulf Coast from Louisiana through the Florida Panhandle should monitor the progress of Nate and heed any advice given by local officials.

graphic will be identical About this product: This graphic shows an approximate representation of coastal areas under a hurricane warning (red), hurricane watch (pink), tropical storm warning (blue) and tropical storm watch (yellow). The orange circle indicates the current position of the center of the tropical cyclone. The black line, when selected, and dots show the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast track of the center at the times indicated. The dot indicating the forecast center location will be black if the cyclone is forecast to be tropical and will be white with a black outline if the cyclone is forecast to be extratropical. If only an L is displayed, then the system is forecast to be a remnant low. The letter inside the dot indicates the NHC's forecast intensity for that time: D : Tropical Depression \u2013 wind speed less than 39 MPH S : Tropical Storm \u2013 wind speed between 39 MPH and 73 MPH H : Hurricane \u2013 wind speed between 74 MPH and 110 MPH M : Major Hurricane \u2013 wind speed greater than 110 MPH NHC tropical cyclone forecast tracks can be in error. This forecast uncertainty is conveyed by the track forecast \"cone\", the solid white and stippled white areas in the graphic. The solid white area depicts the track forecast uncertainty for days 1-3 of the forecast, while the stippled area depicts the uncertainty on days 4-5. Historical data indicate that the entire 5-day path of the center of the tropical cyclone will remain within the cone about 60-70% of the time. To form the cone, a set of imaginary circles are placed along the forecast track at the 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h positions, where the size of each circle is set so that it encloses 67% of the previous five years official forecast errors. The cone is then formed by smoothly connecting the area swept out by the set of circles. It is also important to realize that a tropical cyclone is not a point. Their effects can span many hundreds of miles from the center. The area experiencing hurricane force (one-minute average wind speeds of at least 74 mph) and tropical storm force (one-minute average wind speeds of 39-73 mph) winds can extend well beyond the white areas shown enclosing the most likely track area of the center. The distribution of hurricane and tropical storm force winds in this tropical cyclone can be seen in the Wind History graphic linked above. Considering the combined forecast uncertainties in track, intensity, and size, the chances that any particular location will experience winds of 34 kt (tropical storm force), 50 kt, or 64 kt (hurricane force) from this tropical cyclone are presented in tabular form for selected locations and forecast positions .

DISCUSSION...Strong heating is contributing to the development of towering cumulus and scattered thunderstorms over the mountains of western and central New Mexico. Although lapse rates greater than 6 C/km should stay north of the region -- thereby limiting the magnitude of the overall severe threat -- a very moist air mass and steepening low-level lapse rates will contribute to midday MLCAPE values in the 500-1500 J/kg range. Similar to yesterday, a few organized storms, including supercells, are expected to emerge by 19-20z from the cluster of cumulus developing to the west of a line from Albuquerque to Socorro on the southern fringes of stronger mid-level flow where effective shear values are again in the 35-50 kt range. Severe hail will be possible with these storms, along with brief severe wind gusts given the indication of a ~100-mb-deep well-mixed boundary layer in model soundings prior to arrival of the convection, which is supported by current temperatures in the mid-upper 70s in the Rio Grande Valley. Farther east, a few thunderstorms should also develop over the southern Sangre De Cristo mountains and move eastward, and will also pose a threat for severe hail and brief severe wind gusts, but weakening flow/deep-layer shear east of this area should limit the duration of this threat. Overall, the coverage of the severe threat should again be isolated enough to prevent the issuance of a watch. ..Coniglio/Guyer.. 10/05/2017 ...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...

A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life- threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours. For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov. A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area. A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours. Interests elsewhere in Honduras, the Bay Islands, western Cuba, the Yucatan Peninsula, and the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of Nate. For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service. DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nate was located close to the coast of eastern Honduras near latitude 15.8 North, longitude 84.7 West. Nate is moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn toward the north-northwest is expected overnight, with Nate accelerating along that heading through Saturday. On the forecast track, the center of Nate will move offshore the eastern coast of Honduras during the next several hours, move across the northwestern Caribbean Sea on Friday, and reach the eastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula Friday evening. Nate will then move into the southern Gulf of Mexico Friday night and approach the northern Gulf coast Saturday evening. Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and Nate is expected to become a hurricane by the time it reaches the central Gulf of Mexico. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) mainly to the northeast of the center. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND RAINFALL: Nate is expected to produce the following rain accumulations through this weekend: Southern Honduras and western Nicaragua: 6-10 inches, max 15 inches Eastern El Salvador and northern to central Honduras: 3 to 5 inches, max 8 inches Eastern Yucatan and western Cuba: 2 to 4 inches, max 8 inches Eastern Belize and the Cayman Islands: 1 to 3 inches U.S. Central Gulf Coast states: 3 to 6 inches, max 12 inches Heavy rainfall will occur over a wide area, including locations well away from the center along the Pacific coast of Central America. Rainfall across all of these areas may produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within portions of the warning area in Honduras during the next few hours. Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in Mexico by Friday evening, with tropical storm conditions expected by late Friday. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch areas along the U.S. Gulf coast beginning Saturday evening, with hurricane conditions possible in the hurricane watch area Saturday night. STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore winds on the Yucatan Peninsula and the adjacent islands. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. SURF: Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the northwestern Caribbean during the next day or two. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

Despite moving over land for the past 12-15 hours, the cyclone appears to have a relatively intact and well-defined inner core. Deep convection has actually been increasing over the center, and recent 85-GHz microwave data showed at least some form of a convective ring. Given these signs, the maximum winds are being held at 35 kt. An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft will be investigating Nate during the next several hours to get a better handle on the storm's intensity and structure. Nate has been moving northwestward while crossing Nicaragua and Honduras, and the initial motion estimate is 325/10 kt. The storm is currently embedded within a broad Central American gyre, and it should swing north-northwestward on the east side of this gyre during the next 36 hours. After 36 hours, Nate should turn northward and then northeastward along the western periphery of a mid-tropospheric high centered off the southeastern U.S. coastline. Compared to yesterday at this time, the track models have come into much better agreement, and all the reliable models take Nate's center across the northeastern portion of the Yucatan peninsula in 24 hours and then across the U.S. central Gulf coast between 48 and 60 hours. Because of this tight clustering, there are no notable cross-track changes in the NHC forecast. Speed-wise, however, the updated official forecast is a bit faster than the previous one and has caught up to the various consensus aids. Due to low shear and very high oceanic heat content in the northwestern Caribbean Sea, Nate should at least steadily strengthen once it moves offshore, especially since it appears to have a well-defined inner core. Rapid intensification is still not out of the question, and Nate could be near hurricane intensity by the time it reaches the Yucatan coast in about 24 hours. Land interaction with the Yucatan peninsula could cause a brief hiatus in the strengthening trend, but conditions should be conducive for additional intensification while Nate is over the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, the intensity models have not changed much on this cycle, and the NHC forecast still calls for a 48-hour intensity of 70 kt, which is at the upper end of the guidance between HWRF and HCCA. As mentioned before, Nate could strengthen further in the time between the 48-hour position and when it crosses the U.S. Gulf coast. KEY MESSAGES: 1. Heavy rainfall is the main threat from Nate in portions of Central America, with life-threatening flash flooding and mud slides possible in portions of Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, and Belize through Friday night. 2. Nate could be near hurricane intensity when it approaches the Yucatan Peninsula late Friday, bringing direct impacts from wind, storm surge, and heavy rainfall. A tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch are in effect for a portion of this area, and life-threatening flash flooding is also possible. 3. Nate is forecast to reach the northern Gulf Coast this weekend as a hurricane, and the threat of direct impacts from wind, storm surge, and heavy rainfall is increasing from Louisiana through the western Florida Panhandle. Hurricane and tropical storm watches, as well as a storm surge watch, have been issued for a portion of the northern Gulf Coast, and residents in these areas should monitor the progress of Nate, heeding any advice given by local officials.

Little to no additional surge impacts expected. PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS * EVACUATIONS: RECOVERY PHASE - Do not return to evacuated areas until it is safe. Listen for the all-clear signal from local authorities. * OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION: Be a good neighbor and check on those living next to you. Be neighborly and lend a helping hand. Those who rode out the storm away from their home or business are likely anxious to return. However, allow some time for work crews to make a clear path for emergency vehicles. Downed power lines and trees may be blocking roads and flood waters may have washed out or overspread sections of key travel routes. Traffic lights may also be out of service. Do not attempt to return to evacuated areas until local authorities give the All-Clear signal. Do not go sightseeing within impacted communities simply to observe storm damage. Sightseers can interfere with the timeliness of rescuers and first responders to needlessly jeopardize lives. When inspecting damage, use flashlights rather than candles or flamed lighting. Be aware of sparks that can ignite leaking gas or other flammables. When clearing out fallen trees, be careful with chain saws and axes. Always wear protective gear and keep others at a safe distance. Use these tools according to operating manuals and safety instruction. Leaning trees and those which have fallen on roof tops can be especially challenging. If you are not in good health or unsure about what you are doing, have someone else with tree cutting experience do the job. Never cut trees without a partner. If using a generator, avoid carbon monoxide poisoning by following instructions by the manufacturer. Make sure that the generator is run in a well ventilated space. * ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION: - For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov - For information on creating an emergency plan see getagameplan.org - For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org NEXT UPDATE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T07:15:23.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "77bf6cb5e8a94f04e6dc42f514707a109a6d2d75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rGoBXk0qpHOSRaROsSq8805SP4D71HDBo4F7Bxt.KTVDFUiQ6uqMH", "site_full": "www.nhc.noaa.gov", "site": "noaa.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/nhc_at1.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "NHC Atlantic Wallet 1 - Tropical Storm Nate (AL162017)", "title": "Local Statement for Mobile, AL / Pensacola, FL", "title_full": "Local Statement for Mobile, AL / Pensacola, FL", "published": "2017-10-06T06:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1535, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 96, "comments": 0, "shares": 96}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "77bf6cb5e8a94f04e6dc42f514707a109a6d2d75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rGoBXk0qpHOSRaROsSq8805SP4D71HDBo4F7Bxt.KTVDFUiQ6uqMH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "nhcwebmaster@noaa.gov (NHC Webmaster)", "published": "2017-10-06T06:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Local Statement for Mobile, AL / Pensacola, FL", "text": "U.S. Watch/Warning Local Products 000 WTUS84 KMOB 081257 HLSMOB ALZ051>060-261>266-FLZ201>206-MSZ067-075-076-078-079-082100- Tropical Storm Nate Local Statement Intermediate Advisory Number 16A National Weather Service Mobile AL AL162017 757 AM CDT Sun Oct 8 2017 This product covers portions of southwest Alabama...northwest Florida...south central Alabama...and inland southeast Mississippi. **NATE RAPIDLY WEAKENING BUT STORM SURGE FLOODING CONTINUES** NEW INFORMATION * CHANGES TO WATCHES AND WARNINGS: - The Tropical Storm Warning has been cancelled for Baldwin Central, Baldwin Coastal, Baldwin Inland, Choctaw, Clarke, George, Greene, Mobile Central, Mobile Coastal, Mobile Inland, Perry, Stone, Washington, and Wayne * CURRENT WATCHES AND WARNINGS: - A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for Butler, Conecuh, Covington, Crenshaw, Escambia, Escambia Inland, Monroe, Okaloosa Inland, Santa Rosa Inland, and Wilcox - A Storm Surge Warning is in effect for Baldwin Central, Baldwin Coastal, Baldwin Inland, Mobile Central, Mobile Coastal, and Mobile Inland - A Storm Surge Warning and Tropical Storm Warning are in effect for Escambia Coastal, Okaloosa Coastal, and Santa Rosa Coastal * STORM INFORMATION: - About 110 miles north-northwest of Pensacola FL or about 140 miles northwest of Destin FL - 32.0N 88.0W - Storm Intensity 45 mph - Movement North-northeast or 25 degrees at 23 mph SITUATION OVERVIEW Tropical Storm Nate is weakening rapidly over interior southwestern Alabama this morning as it moves toward central Alabama. Maximum sustained winds continue to decrease near and east of the center of Nate. Storm surge values are falling across the coastal areas, but remain elevated due to a persistent southerly wind. The tornado and flash flood threats will continue to decrease this morning and remain confined mainly east of I-65. The main concern is inundation flooding from previous heavy rains until water levels recede. POTENTIAL IMPACTS * SURGE: Potential impacts from the main surge event remain along the Alabama and northwest Florida coastline. These impacts include: - Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding accentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to buildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by floating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an extended period. - Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads washed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems and barriers may become stressed. - Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss. - Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many small craft broken away from moorings, especially in unprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and stranded. Maximum storm surge inundation of 5 to 8 feet across southwest Alabama and 3 to 5 feet across the western Florida Panhandle early this morning will continue to lower throughout the day. * WIND: Potential impacts from the main wind event continue across south central Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle. These impacts include: - Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about. - Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over. - A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on bridges and other elevated roadways. - Scattered power and communications outages. Elsewhere across portions of southwest Alabama and inland southeast Mississippi little to no impact is anticipated. * FLOODING RAIN: Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding east of the Alabama River. If realized, these impacts include: - Localized rainfall flooding may prompt a few evacuations. - Rivers and tributaries may quickly rise with swifter currents. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may become swollen and overflow in spots. - Flood waters can enter a few structures, especially in usually vulnerable spots. A few places where rapid ponding of water occurs at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage areas. Several storm drains and retention ponds become near-full and begin to overflow. Some brief road and bridge closures. Elsewhere across portions of southwest Alabama...northwest Florida...south central Alabama...and inland southeast Mississippi., little to no impact is anticipated. * TORNADOES: Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfoldi Be ready to move to the identified safe room if your home or shelter begins to fail. Quickly move to an interior room on the lowest floor. Put as many sturdy walls between you and the storm as you can. Protect your head and body. When major hurricanes make landfall, extreme winds bring a tremendous threat to life and cause devastating to catastrophic damage. During landfall, listen for extreme wind warnings which indicate the exact timing and location of these incredible life-threatening winds. If issued for you area, move to the safest place within your home or shelter. Take the same life-saving actions as if it were a violent tornado.ng across portions of northwest Florida and south central Alabama. If realized, these impacts include: - The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency plans during tropical events. - A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power and communications disruptions. - Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.

A PESAR DE MOVERSE SOBRE TIERRA DURANTE LAS ULTIMAS 12 A 15 HORAS, SE APARENTA QUE EL CICLON TIENE UN NUCLEO INTERIOR INTACTO Y BIEN DEFINIDA. CONVECCION PROFUNDA HA ESTADO AUMENTANDO SOBRE EL CENTRO, Y DATOS DE MICROONDAS DE 85-GHZ MAS RECIENTES MUESTRAN POR LO MENOS ALGO DE FORMA DE UN ANILLO CONVECTIVO. DADAS ESTAS SENALES, LOS VIENTOS MAXIMOS SE MANTIENEN A 35 NUDOS. UN AVION DE CAZAHURACANES DE LA FUERZA AEREA ESTARA INVESTIGANDO NATE DURANTE LAS PROXIMAS HORAS PARA TENER UN MEJOR ASESORAMIENTO DE LA INTENSIDAD Y ESTRUCTURA DE LA TORMENTA. NATE SE HA ESTADO MOVIENDO HACIA EL NOROESTE MIENTRAS CRUZANDO NICARAGUA Y HONDURAS, Y EL MOVIMIENTO INICIAL ESTIMADO ES 325/10 NUDOS. LA TORMENTA ACTUALMENTE ESTA ENCRUSTRADA DENTRO DE UN GIRO CENTRO AMERICANO AMPLIO, Y DEBERA MOVERSE NORTE NOROESTE EN EL LADO ESTE DE ESTE GIRO DURANTE LAS PROXIMAS 36 HORAS. DESPUES DE 36 HORAS, NATE DEBERA GIRAR HACIA EL NORTE Y DESPUES HACIA EL NORESTE A LO LARGO DE LA PERIFERIA OESTE DE UNA ALTA PRESION EN LOS NIVELOS MEDIOS CENTRALIZADA FUERA DE LA COSTA SURESTE DE LOS ESTADOS UNIDOS. COMPARADO A ESTA HORA DE AYER, LOS MODELOS DE TRAYECTORIA HAN LLEGADO A UN ACUERDO MUCHO MEJOR, Y TODOS LOS MODELOS DE CONFIANZA LLEVA EL CENTRO DE NATE A TRAVES DE LA PORCION NORESTE DE LA PENINSULA DE YUCATAN EN 24 HORAS Y DESPUES A TRAVES DE LA COSTA CENTRAL DEL GOLFO DE LOS ESTADOS UNIDOS ENTRE 48 Y 60 HORAS. DEBIDO AL AGRUPAMIENTO APRETADO, NO HAY CAMBIOS EN EL PRONOSTICO DEL CNH. SIN EMBARGO, EN TERMINOS DE VELOCIDAD, EL PRONOSTICO OFICIAL ES UN POCO MAS RAPIDO QUE EL PRONOSTICO PREVIO Y HA ALCANZADO A LAS GUIAS DE CONSENSO. DEBIDO A VIENTOS CORTANTES LEVES Y CONTENIDO DE CALOR OCEANICO MUY ALTO EN EL NOROESTE DEL MAR CARIBE, NATE DEBERA POR LO MENOS FORTALECERSE CONTINUAMENTE A MEDIDA QUE SE MUEVA SOBRE MAR, ESPECIALMENTE QUE APARENTA TENER UN NUCLEO INTERIOR BIEN DEFINIDA. INTENSIFICACION RAPIDA TODAVIA NO SE DESCARTA, Y NATE PODRIA ESTAR CERCA DE INTENSIDAD DE HURACAN EN EL MOMENTO QUE LLEGUE A LA COSTA DE YUCATAN EN ALREDEDOR DE 24 HORAS. INTERACCION CON TIERRA CON LA PENINSULA DE YUCATAN PODRIA CAUSAR UNA BREVE PAUSA EN LA TENDENCIA DE FORTALECIMIENTO, PERO CONDICIONES DEBERAN ESTAR CONDUCENTES PARA INTENSIFICACION ADICIONAL MIENTRAS NATE ESTE SOBRE EL GOLFO DE MEXICO. EN GENERAL, LOS MODELOS DE INTENSIDAD NO HAN CAMBIADO MUCHO EN ESTE CICLO, Y EL PRONOSTICO DEL CNH TODAVIA MUESTRA UNA INTENSIDAD EN 48 HORAS DE 70 NUDOS, LA CUAL ESTA EN EL LADO ALTO DE LAS GUIAS ENTRE EL HWRF Y HCCA. COMO SE HABIA MENCIONADO ANTES, NATE PODRIA FORTALECERSE AUN MAS EN EL PERIODO ENTRE LA POSICION EN 48 HORAS Y CUANDO CRUCE LA COSTA DEL GOLFO DE LOS ESTADOS UNIDOS. MENSAJES CLAVES: 1. FUERTES LLUVIAS SON LA AMENAZA PRINCIPAL DE NATE EN PORCIONES DE CENTRO AMERICA, CON INUNDACIONES REPENTINAS AMENAZANTES A LA VIDA Y DESLIZAMIENTOS DE TIERRA POSIBLES EN PORCIONES DE NICARAGUA, HONDURAS, COSTA RICA, PANAMA Y BELIZE HASTA EL VIERNES EN LA NOCHE. 2. NATE PODRIA ESTAR CERCA DE INTENSIDAD DE HURACAN CUANDO SE APROXIMA A LA PENINSULA DE YUCATAN TARDE EL VIERNES, TRAYENDO IMPACTOS DIRECTOS DE VIENTOS, MAREJADA CICLONICA, Y FUERTES LLUVIAS. UN AVISO DE TORMENTA TROPICAL Y UNA VIGILANCIA DE HURACAN ESTA EN EFECTO PARA UNA PORCION DE ESTA AREA E INUNDACIONES REPENTINAS AMENAZANTES A LA VIDA TAMBIEN SON POSIBLES. 3. SE PRONOSTICA QUE NATE ALCANCE EL NORTE DE LA COSTA DEL GOLFO ESTE FIN DE SEMANA COMO HURACAN, Y LA AMENAZA DE IMPACTOS DIRECTOS DE VIENTOS, MAREJADA CICLONICA, Y LLUVIAS FUERTES ESTA AUMENTANDO DESDE LOUISIANA HASTA EL OESTE DEL NORTE DE FLORIDA. VIGILANCIAS DE HURACAN Y DE TORMENTA TROPICAL, AL IGUAL QUE DE MAREJADA CICLONICA, HAN SIDO EMITIDAS PARA UNA PORCION DEL NORTE DE LA COSTA DEL GOLFO, Y RESIDENTES EN ESTAS AREAS DEBERAN MONITOREAR EL PROGRESO DE NATE, PRESTANDO ATENCION A SUGERENCIAS DADAS POR LOS OFICIALES LOCALES.

A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life- threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours. For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov. A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area. A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours. Interests elsewhere in Honduras, the Bay Islands, western Cuba, the Yucatan Peninsula, and the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of Nate. For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service. DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nate was located by radar from Honduras and an Air Force reconnaissance plane near latitude 16.1 North, longitude 84.8 West. Nate is moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). A turn toward the north-northwest is expected today, with Nate accelerating along that heading through Saturday. On the forecast track, the center of Nate will move over the Gulf of Honduras and across the northwestern Caribbean Sea today, and reach the eastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula Friday evening. Nate will then move into the southern Gulf of Mexico Friday night and approach the northern Gulf coast Saturday evening. Data from the reconnaissance plane and a NOAA buoy indicate that the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and Nate is expected to become a hurricane by the time it reaches the central Gulf of Mexico. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) mainly to the east of the center. The estimated minimum central pressure from a reconnaissance plane data is 999 mb (29.50 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND RAINFALL: Nate is expected to produce the following rain accumulations through this weekend: Southern Honduras and western Nicaragua: 6-10 inches, max 15 inches Eastern El Salvador and northern to central Honduras: 3 to 5 inches, max 8 inches Eastern Yucatan and western Cuba: 2 to 4 inches, max 8 inches Eastern Belize and the Cayman Islands: 1 to 3 inches U.S. Central Gulf Coast states: 3 to 6 inches, max 12 inches Heavy rainfall will occur over a wide area, including locations well away from the center along the Pacific coast of Central America. Rainfall across all of these areas may produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within portions of the warning area in Honduras during the next few hours. Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in Mexico by Friday evening, with tropical storm conditions expected by late Friday. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch areas along the U.S. Gulf coast beginning Saturday evening, with hurricane conditions possible in the hurricane watch area Saturday night. STORM SURGE: A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore winds on the Yucatan Peninsula and the adjacent islands. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. SURF: Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the northwestern Caribbean during the next day or two. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

For storm information specific to your area outside the United States, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service. DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nate was located near latitude 18.7 North, longitude 85.0 West. Nate is moving toward the north-northwest near 21 mph (33 km/h) and this motion is expected to continue through Saturday, with a turn toward the north and northeast expected Saturday night and Sunday. On the forecast track, the center of Nate will move across the northwestern Caribbean Sea today, and move near or over the northeastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula this evening. Nate will then move into the southern Gulf of Mexico tonight, approach the northern Gulf coast Saturday, and then move near or over the northern Gulf coast Saturday night or Sunday. Reports from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum sustained winds are now near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and Nate is expected to become a hurricane by the time it reaches the northern Gulf of Mexico. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) mainly to the east of the center. The minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane Hunter data is 996 mb (29.42 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND RAINFALL: Nate is expected to produce the following rain accumulations through this weekend: Southern Honduras and western Nicaragua: 6-10 inches, max 15 inches Eastern El Salvador and northern to central Honduras: 3 to 5 inches, max 8 inches Eastern Yucatan and western Cuba: 2 to 4 inches, max 8 inches Eastern Belize and the Cayman Islands: 1 to 3 inches U.S. Central Gulf Coast states, eastern Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians: 3 to 6 inches, max 12 inches Heavy rainfall will occur over a wide area, including locations well away from the center along the Pacific coast of Central America. Rainfall across all of these areas may produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in Mexico by tonight, with tropical storm conditions expected by this evening. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in Cuba by tonight, and are possible in the watch area in Cuba tonight. Along the northern Gulf Coast, hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area Saturday night, with tropical storm conditions expected by late Saturday. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning area by Saturday night. Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area Saturday night, and tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch area Saturday night and Sunday. STORM SURGE: In the United States, The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water is expected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide... Morgan City, Louisiana to the Alabama/Florida border...4 to 7 ft Alabama/Florida border to Indian Pass, Florida...2 to 4 ft The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office. In Mexico, a storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore winds on the Yucatan Peninsula and the adjacent islands. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. SURF: Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the northwestern Caribbean during the next day or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

The central pressure is fluctuating near 996 mb, and the aircraft- reported winds support an initial intensity of 45 kt. This is in good agreement with the satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB. Satellite imagery shows that convection associated with Nate has been increasing during the past several hours, and that the storm has good outflow in the western semicircle. The center has moved generally northward during the past 12 hr. However, the latest recon fixes and satellite imagery suggest that a north-northwestward motion is resuming at about 18 kt. Nate is between a complex deep-layer low pressure area over the western Gulf of Mexico and Central America and a building ridge of high pressure over the western Atlantic. This combination should steer the storm quickly north-northwestward for the next 36 h or so. After that, Nate should turn northward and northeastward as it goes around the western edge of the ridge and recurves into the mid-latitude westerlies. While the guidance is in good agreement with this scenario, there has been a rightward shift to the latest guidance, likely due to the recent northward motion. The new forecast track is thus also shifted to the east of the previous forecast, and it now calls for the center of Nate to pass near or over the northeastern tip of the Yucatan Peninsula in about 12 h, followed by landfall on the northern Gulf Coast between 36-48 h. The new track is in the center of the guidance envelope in good agreement with the various consensus models. Conditions appear favorable for strengthening up to landfall on the northern Gulf Coast, and Nate is expected to make landfall there as a hurricane. The new intensity forecast, which is an update of the previous one, lies near the upper edge of the intensity guidance. It should be noted that the Rapid Intensification Index of the SHIPS model continues to indicate an above normal chance of rapid intensification. However, the current structure of the cyclone does not favor rapid development. KEY MESSAGES: 1. Nate could be near hurricane intensity when it approaches the Yucatan Peninsula later today bringing direct impacts from wind, storm surge, and heavy rainfall. A tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch are in effect for a portion of this area, and life-threatening flash flooding is also possible. 2. Life-threatening storm surge flooding is likely along portions of the northern Gulf Coast, and a storm surge warning has been issued from Morgan City, Louisiana, to the Alabama/Florida border. Residents in these areas should heed any evacuation instructions given by local officials. 3. A hurricane warning has been has been issued for portions of the northern Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Alabama, and preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion in these areas. 4. Nate will bring heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches with isolated totals of 12 inches from the central Gulf Coast states into the eastern Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians through this weekend, resulting in the possibility of flash flooding in these areas. 5. Heavy rainfall from Nate will continue to be a threat in portions of Central America, with life-threatening flash flooding and mud slides possible in portions of Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, and Belize through tonight.

The orange circle indicates the current position of the center of the tropical cyclone. The black line, when selected, and dots show the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast track of the center at the times indicated. The dot indicating the forecast center location will be black if the cyclone is forecast to be tropical and will be white with a black outline if the cyclone is forecast to be extratropical. If only an L is displayed, then the system is forecast to be a remnant low. The letter inside the dot indicates the NHC's forecast intensity for that time: D : Tropical Depression \u2013 wind speed less than 39 MPH S : Tropical Storm \u2013 wind speed between 39 MPH and 73 MPH H : Hurricane \u2013 wind speed between 74 MPH and 110 MPH M : Major Hurricane \u2013 wind speed greater than 110 MPH NHC tropical cyclone forecast tracks can be in error. This forecast uncertainty is conveyed by the track forecast \"cone\", the solid white and stippled white areas in the graphic. The solid white area depicts the track forecast uncertainty for days 1-3 of the forecast, while the stippled area depicts the uncertainty on days 4-5. Historical data indicate that the entire 5-day path of the center of the tropical cyclone will remain within the cone about 60-70% of the time. To form the cone, a set of imaginary circles are placed along the forecast track at the 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h positions, where the size of each circle is set so that it encloses 67% of the previous five years official forecast errors. The cone is then formed by smoothly connecting the area swept out by the set of circles. It is also important to realize that a tropical cyclone is not a point. Their effects can span many hundreds of miles from the center. The area experiencing hurricane force (one-minute average wind speeds of at least 74 mph) and tropical storm force (one-minute average wind speeds of 39-73 mph) winds can extend well beyond the white areas shown enclosing the most likely track area of the center. The distribution of hurricane and tropical storm force winds in this tropical cyclone can be seen in the Wind History graphic linked above.

A warning is typically issued 36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion. A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area. A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life- threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours. For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov. A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area. A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours. Interests elsewhere in western Cuba, the Yucatan Peninsula, and the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of Nate. For storm information specific to your area in the United States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside the United States, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service. DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nate was located near latitude 19.4 North, longitude 85.3 West. Nate is moving toward the north-northwest near 21 mph (33 km/h) and this motion is expected to continue through Saturday, with a turn toward the north and northeast expected Saturday night and Sunday. On the forecast track, the center of Nate will move across the northwestern Caribbean Sea this afternoon and move near or over the northeastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula this evening. Nate will then move into the southern Gulf of Mexico tonight, approach the northern Gulf coast Saturday, and then move near or over the northern Gulf coast Saturday night or Sunday. Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and Nate is expected to become a hurricane by the time it reaches the northern Gulf of Mexico. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km) mainly to the east of the center. NOAA buoy 42056, located to the north of the center, recently reported a 1-minute average wind of 38 mph (61 km/h) and a wind gust of 49 mph (79 km/h). The minimum central pressure recently reported by the Hurricane Hunter is 996 mb (29.42 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND RAINFALL: Nate is expected to produce the following rain accumulations through this weekend: Southern Honduras and western Nicaragua: 6-10 inches, max 15 inches Eastern El Salvador and northern to central Honduras: 3 to 5 inches, max 8 inches Eastern Yucatan and western Cuba: 2 to 4 inches, max 8 inches Eastern Belize and the Cayman Islands: 1 to 3 inches U.S. Central Gulf Coast states, eastern Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians: 3 to 6 inches, max 12 inches Heavy rainfall will occur over a wide area, including locations well away from the center along the Pacific coast of Central America. Rainfall across all of these areas may produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in Mexico by tonight, with tropical storm conditions expected by this evening. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in Cuba by tonight, and are possible in the watch area in Cuba tonight. Along the northern Gulf Coast, hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area Saturday night, with tropical storm conditions expected by late Saturday. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning area by Saturday night. Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area Saturday night, and tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch area Saturday night and Sunday. STORM SURGE: In the United States, the combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water is expected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide... Morgan City, Louisiana to the Alabama/Florida border...4 to 7 ft Alabama/Florida border to Indian Pass, Florida...2 to 4 ft The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office. In Mexico, a storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore winds on the Yucatan Peninsula and the adjacent islands. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. SURF: Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the northwestern Caribbean during the next day or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

And, it is NCEI\u2019s job to chronicle these disasters and document their impacts to the Nation. 1. Why study the cost of weather and climate disasters? \nNCEI is the Nation's scorekeeper in terms of addressing severe weather and climate events in their historical perspective. As part of our responsibilities of monitoring and assessing the climate, we track and evaluate climate events in the United States that have great economic and societal impacts. \nNCEI\u2019s U.S. billion-dollar disaster analysis seeks to bring the best public and private disaster loss data together in a systematic approach. To that end, we maintain a consistent record of weather and climate disasters with costs equaling or exceeding $1 billion in damages (adjusting for inflation) using high-quality data sources and peer-reviewed methods. This enables us to provide historical context to these events when they occur while quantifying their total, direct costs. \nOur data and information are used to examine past events and gauge future risk. The National Hurricane Center , the reinsurance industry , and catastrophe modelers incorporate such information into their assessments, to contextualize risk and loss potential for communities across the Nation. \nNCEI currently monitors and assesses the costs and impacts of: Hurricanes Winter storms 2. What are the most costly weather and climate disasters? \nIn short, tropical cyclones are the most costly of the weather and climate disasters . Since 1980, the U.S. has sustained at least 218 weather and climate disasters where overall damages/costs reached or exceeded $1 billion (including Consumer Price Index adjustment to 2017). The total cost of these 218 events exceeds $1.2 trillion. However, this total does not include the costs for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, which are substantial and are still being assessed. us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters-map-september-2017.png \nNot including hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, 35 tropical cyclones have caused at least $583.5 billion in total damages\u2014with an average of $16.7 billion per event. Accounting for just under a fifth (17 percent) of the total number of events, tropical cyclones have caused almost half (47 percent) of the total damages attributed to billion-dollar weather and climate disasters since 1980. These numbers will dramatically rise once the 2017 hurricanes costs are included. \nFollowing tropical cyclones, the most costly event types are: Drought, with an average cost of $9.4 billion per event Flooding, with an average cost of $4.3 billion per event Freezes, with an average cost of $3.4 billion per event Winter storms, with an average cost of $3.1 billion per event Wildfires, with an average cost of $2.5 billion per event Severe storms, with an average cost of $2.2 billion per event \nFor more information on the distribution of damage from these billion-dollar disaster events, see our summary statistics . 3. Has every state experienced a billion-dollar disaster? \nWhile each region of the United States faces a unique combination of weather and climate events, every state in the country has been impacted by at least one billion-dollar disaster since 1980 . Over 94 of these disasters have affected at least some parts of Texas, while only one event has impacted Hawaii (Hurricane Iniki in 1992). \nWildfires are most common west of the Plains states and in several Southeastern states. Inland flood events\u2014not caused by tropical cyclones\u2014often occur in states near large rivers or the Gulf of Mexico, which is a warm source of moisture to fuel rainstorms. Drought impacts are mostly focused in the Southern and Plains states where crop and livestock assets are densely populated. Severe local storm events are common across the Plains, Southeast, and Ohio River Valley states. And, winter storm impacts are concentrated in the Northeastern states while tropical cyclone impacts range from Texas to New England but also impact many inland states. \nIn total, the Central, South, and Southeast regions typically experience a higher frequency of billion-dollar disasters than other regions. \nTo visualize the the frequency and cost of billion-dollar disasters, check out our mapping tool . 4. How do you calculate a disaster\u2019s price tag? \nIn calculating the cost assessments, we receive input from a variety of public and private data sources including: Insurance Services Office U.S. Army Corps State agencies \nEach of these data sources provides key pieces of information that capture the total, direct costs\u2014both insured and uninsured\u2014of weather and climate events. These costs include: Physical damage to residential, commercial, and government or municipal buildings Material assets within a building Time element losses like business interruption Vehicles and boats Public infrastructure like roads, bridges, and buildings Agricultural assets like crops, livestock, and timber Disaster restoration and wildfire suppression costs \nOne of the key transformations is scaling up insured loss data to account for uninsured and underinsured losses, which differs by peril, geography, and asset class. \nHowever, these loss assessments do not take into account losses to natural capital or assets, health care related losses, or values associated with loss of life. Therefore, our estimates should be considered conservative with respect to what is truly lost, but cannot be completely measured. 5. How long does it take to calculate the price tag? \nThe scale and complexity of a disaster greatly influence the length of time to assess the losses . We\u2019re seeing this with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria right now. Hurricanes are particularly challenging, because it takes time to better understand the wind versus water damage losses across a variety of assets (like homes, businesses, boats and vehicles, infrastructure, and agriculture) and how much of this damage is insured versus uninsured. In contrast, with more localized events\u2014like a Colorado hail storm\u2014where property is highly insured, we can more quickly capture the losses. 6. Are billion-dollar disasters becoming more frequent? \nThe increases in population and material wealth over the last several decades are an important factor for higher damage potential. These trends are further complicated by the fact that many population centers and infrastructure exist in vulnerable areas like coasts and river floodplains, while building codes are often insufficient in reducing damage from extreme events. Climate change is also playing a role in the increasing frequency of some types of extreme weather that lead to billion-dollar disasters. 1980-2017-year-to-date-us-billion-dollar-disaster-event-frequency-graph.png 7. Has the U.S. experienced more flooding events in recent years? \nBillion-dollar inland\u2014non-tropical\u2014flood events have increased in the United States . Most notably, four separate billion-dollar inland flood events occurred in 2016. This doubled the previous record since no more than two of these events had occurred in a year since 1980 until last year. \nSo far in 2017, two non-tropical inland flood events have affected the country (in California and Missouri/Arkansas). Also, we experienced historic rainfall from Hurricane Harvey, which is tropical-cyclone related flooding. This perhaps should be expected, as heavy rainfall events and their ensuing flood risks are increasing because warmer temperatures are \u201cloading\u201d the atmosphere with more water vapor.

The orange circle indicates the current position of the center of the tropical cyclone. The black line, when selected, and dots show the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast track of the center at the times indicated. The dot indicating the forecast center location will be black if the cyclone is forecast to be tropical and will be white with a black outline if the cyclone is forecast to be extratropical. If only an L is displayed, then the system is forecast to be a remnant low. The letter inside the dot indicates the NHC's forecast intensity for that time: D : Tropical Depression \u2013 wind speed less than 39 MPH S : Tropical Storm \u2013 wind speed between 39 MPH and 73 MPH H : Hurricane \u2013 wind speed between 74 MPH and 110 MPH M : Major Hurricane \u2013 wind speed greater than 110 MPH NHC tropical cyclone forecast tracks can be in error. This forecast uncertainty is conveyed by the track forecast \"cone\", the solid white and stippled white areas in the graphic. The solid white area depicts the track forecast uncertainty for days 1-3 of the forecast, while the stippled area depicts the uncertainty on days 4-5. Historical data indicate that the entire 5-day path of the center of the tropical cyclone will remain within the cone about 60-70% of the time. To form the cone, a set of imaginary circles are placed along the forecast track at the 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h positions, where the size of each circle is set so that it encloses 67% of the previous five years official forecast errors. The cone is then formed by smoothly connecting the area swept out by the set of circles. It is also important to realize that a tropical cyclone is not a point. Their effects can span many hundreds of miles from the center. The area experiencing hurricane force (one-minute average wind speeds of at least 74 mph) and tropical storm force (one-minute average wind speeds of 39-73 mph) winds can extend well beyond the white areas shown enclosing the most likely track area of the center. The distribution of hurricane and tropical storm force winds in this tropical cyclone can be seen in the Wind History graphic linked above. Considering the combined forecast uncertainties in track, intensity, and size, the chances that any particular location will experience winds of 34 kt (tropical storm force), 50 kt, or 64 kt (hurricane force) from this tropical cyclone are presented in tabular form for selected locations and forecast positions .

A warning is typically issued 36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm- force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion. A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area. A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life- threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours. For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov. A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area. A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours. Interests elsewhere in western Cuba, the Yucatan Peninsula, and the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of Nate. For storm information specific to your area in the United States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside the United States, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service. DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nate was located by NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter planes near latitude 21.4 North, longitude 85.9 West. Nate is moving toward the north-northwest near 22 mph (35 km/h), and this motion is expected to continue through Saturday, with a turn toward the north and northeast expected Saturday night and Sunday. On the forecast track, the center of Nate will move near the northeastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula this evening. Nate will then move into the southern Gulf of Mexico tonight, approach the northern Gulf coast Saturday, and then make landfall over the northern Gulf coast Saturday night or Sunday. Reports from the reconnaissance planes indicate that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast during the next 36 hours, and Nate is expected to become a hurricane by the time it reaches the northern Gulf of Mexico. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km) mainly to the east of the center. The minimum central pressure based on data from the aircraft is 990 mb (29.23 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND RAINFALL: Nate is expected to produce the following rain accumulations through Monday: Western Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador: Lingering inflow bands will bring additional 2-4 inches, max 6 inches. Eastern Yucatan and western Cuba: 2 to 4 inches, max 6 inches. Eastern Belize and the Cayman Islands: 1 to 3 inches. East of the Mississippi River from the central Gulf Coast into the Deep South, eastern Tennessee Valley, and southern Appalachians: 3 to 6 inches, max 10 inches. Across the lower Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians: 2 to 4 inches, max 6 inches. Heavy rainfall will occur over a wide area, including locations well away from the center along the Pacific coast of Central America. Rainfall across all of these areas may produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in Mexico tonight, with tropical storm conditions expected during the next few hours. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in Cuba tonight, and are possible in the watch area in Cuba tonight. Along the northern Gulf Coast, hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area Saturday night, with tropical storm conditions expected by late Saturday. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning area by Saturday night. Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area Saturday night, and tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch area Saturday night and Sunday. STORM SURGE: In the United States, the combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water is expected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide... Morgan City, Louisiana to the mouth of the Mississippi River...4 to 6 ft Mouth of the Mississippi River to the Alabama/Florida border...5 to 8 ft Alabama/Florida border to the Okaloosa/Walton County Line...4 to 6 ft Okaloosa/Walton County Line to Indian Pass, Florida...2 to 4 ft Indian Pass to Crystal River, Florida...1 to 3 ft The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office. In Mexico, a storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore winds on the Yucatan Peninsula and the adjacent islands. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. SURF: Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the northwestern Caribbean during the next day or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

A warning is typically issued 36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm- force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion. A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area. A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life- threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours. For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov. A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area. A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours. Interests elsewhere in western Cuba, the Yucatan Peninsula, and the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico should monitor the progress of Nate. For storm information specific to your area in the United States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside the United States, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service. DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nate was located near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 86.4 West. Nate is moving toward the north-northwest near 22 mph (35 km/h), and this general motion is expected to continue through late Saturday. A turn toward the north is forecast Saturday night, followed by a turn toward north-northeast on Sunday. On the forecast track, the center of Nate will move across the Gulf of Mexico overnight and on Saturday, and will make landfall along the central U.S. Gulf coast Saturday evening or Saturday night. Reports from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is expected through Saturday up until the time Nate makes landfall along the northern Gulf coast. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km) primarily to the east of the center. A wind gust of 52 mph (84 km/h) was recently reported in Isabel Rubio in Pinar del Rio, Cuba. The minimum central pressure based on aircraft data is 990 mb (29.24 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue within the tropical storm warning area in Mexico during the next few hours. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area in Cuba tonight, and are possible in the watch area in Cuba tonight. Along the northern Gulf Coast, hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning area Saturday night, with tropical storm conditions expected by late Saturday. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning area by Saturday night. Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area Saturday night, and tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch area Saturday night and Sunday. STORM SURGE: In the United States, the combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water is expected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide... Morgan City, Louisiana to the mouth of the Mississippi River...4 to 6 ft Mouth of the Mississippi River to the Alabama/Florida border...5 to 8 ft Alabama/Florida border to the Okaloosa/Walton County Line...4 to 6 ft Okaloosa/Walton County Line to Indian Pass, Florida...2 to 4 ft Indian Pass to Crystal River, Florida...1 to 3 ft The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office. In Mexico, a storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in areas of onshore winds on the Yucatan Peninsula and the adjacent islands. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. RAINFALL: Nate is expected to produce the following rain accumulations through Monday: Eastern Yucatan and western Cuba: 2 to 4 inches, max 6 inches. Eastern Belize and the Cayman Islands: 1 to 3 inches. East of the Mississippi River from the central Gulf Coast into the Deep South, eastern Tennessee Valley, and southern Appalachians: 3 to 6 inches, max 10 inches. Across the lower Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians: 2 to 4 inches, max 6 inches. TORNADOES: Isolated tornadoes will be possible beginning Saturday afternoon over parts of the central Gulf Coast region. SURF: Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the northwestern Caribbean during the next day or so. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

Valid 070339Z - 070445Z   496 continues. SUMMARY...Scattered gusts of 50-70 mph are possible for the next several hours. A watch extension-in-area may be used on the eastern portion of the watch from I-40 north to the KS/OK border if short-term trends dictate as such in another 1-2 hours. DISCUSSION...Radar mosaic shows an extensive southwest-northeast squall line from the TX Caprock northeast into western IA. The greatest remaining severe risk is confined to the eastern TX Panhandle into western and northwestern OK during the next 1-2 hours. A moist airmass has been slow to cool across western OK where a moist axis extends from near CDS north-northeastward to near END (surface dewpoints in the upper 60s degrees F). The LLJ is focused from near I-40 northward into east-central KS per area WSR-88D VAD data. The deep-layer ascent provided by the mid-level trough, isentropic ascent, and southeast-surging continental-polar cold front will aid in maintaining a mature squall line into areas east of severe thunderstorm watch 496. It seems like the severe threat will diminish with eastward extent as storms move east of the buoyancy axis (reference the 00 UTC AMA and OUN raobs). Where the risk ceases is a bit uncertain so it is possible some of the severe gust risk will extend beyond the eastern bounds of the current watch. If short-term trends dictate, counties may be added to the current watch in a step-by-step fashion. ..Smith..   ATTN...WFO...ICT...OUN...LUB...AMA...

The NOAA plane measured a maximum 700-mb flight-level wind of 75 kt, but the SFMR instruments on both planes have only measured surface winds as high as 55 kt. It seems that the highest winds haven't quite mixed down to the surface, but it's likely that the system is at least producing surface winds of 60 kt, which will be the initial intensity for this advisory. The NOAA flight also reported that an eyewall is forming to the east of Nate's center. Nate has been accelerating toward the north-northwest between a large cyclonic gyre centered over southern Mexico and a mid-level high located over the southwestern Atlantic, and the initial motion estimate is 340/19 kt. This north-northwestward motion is expected to continue for the next 24 hours, with Nate turning northward and slowing down only slightly around the time it is forecast to cross the northern Gulf coast between 24-36 hours. After landfall, the cyclone is expected to get swept up ahead of a large mid-latitude trough, and accelerate northeastward over the eastern United States. At least up until landfall, the track guidance is in good agreement, and the NHC forecast is relatively unchanged from the previous one. After landfall, the new forecast is just a tad slower in order to give some credence to the slower solution provided by the ECMWF model. Atmospheric and oceanic conditions appear conducive for Nate to continue strengthening up until the time it makes landfall along the northern Gulf coast. Nate is likely to become a hurricane overnight, and the new NHC forecast has been raised to a peak intensity of 75 kt at 24 hours based on guidance from the SHIPS and LGEM models. The intensity consensus and HCCA are lower than that due to the HWRF solution, which shows absolutely no strengthening before landfall. Disregarding that solution, it seems prudent to be above the consensus, close to the upper end of the guidance envelope. Rapid intensification still cannot be ruled out since the indices are showing a 50/50 chance of a 25-kt increase over the next 24 hours. If Nate becomes a hurricane soon, then additional increases in the official intensity forecast may be necessary in subsequent advisories. Aircraft data indicate that Nate is an asymmetric storm, with most of the winds located on the eastern side of the circulation, and this structure is likely to continue until landfall due to the cyclone's fast forward speed. Therefore, locations to the east of where Nate makes landfall are expected to receive significantly stronger winds than locations to the west of the center. Regardless, there is still too much uncertainty to know exactly where landfall will occur, and all locations within the hurricane warning area should be preparing for hurricane-force winds. KEY MESSAGES: 1. Life-threatening storm surge flooding is likely along portions of the northern Gulf Coast, and a storm surge warning is now in effect from Morgan City, Louisiana, to the Okaloosa/Walton county line in Florida. Residents in these areas should heed any evacuation instructions given by local officials. 2. A hurricane warning is in effect for portions of the northern Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Alabama, and preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion in these areas. 3. Nate will bring heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches with isolated totals of 10 inches east of the Mississippi River from the central Gulf Coast into the Deep South, eastern Tennessee Valley, and southern Appalachians through Monday, resulting in the the potential for flash flooding in these areas. 4. Moisture from Nate interacting with a frontal zone will also bring 2 to 4 inches with isolated totals of 6 inches across the lower Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians Sunday into Monday, which will also increase the risk for flash flooding across these locations.
