Without being critical of your intent, it seems to me that there is a constant call for charitable donations amongst monied media figures on social media that strikes me as ironic given who their wider audience is (that at best can seem idealistic and at worst can seem like self aggrandizing public relations). Is their a need for wealthy individuals to fundamentally change the way they go about raising awareness for different social issues that takes into account the greater personal costs that the working poor would incur (be they financial, social, or political) by answering said calls to activism? Wouldn't having more celebrities and wealthy private citizens setting up ngo's do more to address social and economic inequality than having those individuals call for money from working and middle class people, while simultaneously creating jobs for those that need them the most? Why or why not?

Posted on Share \nPolice run for cover at the scene of a shooting near the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas Sunday night. \nThe rapid rat-tat-tat-tat of gunfire that engulfed a country music festival in Las Vegas Sunday night, killing nearly 60 people and wounding hundreds more, left little doubt that the shooter was using an automatic weapon. \nAuthorities confirmed Monday that 23 firearms, some equipped with scopes, had been recovered in the 32nd-floor Mandalay Bay hotel room where the shooter, Stephen Paddock, had been staying. At least some of those weapons were either fully automatic or altered to be so, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters at a press conference. \nFederal law makes it difficult \u2014 and expensive \u2014 for the average person to get their hands on a fully automatic weapon. But gun control advocates told BuzzFeed News that Nevada law makes it easy \u2014 and relatively cheap \u2014 for anyone to purchase a small device that makes an assault rifle fire like a machine gun. \nNow, as police continue their investigation into Paddock, discussion has already begun on what role, if any, the state's gun laws may have played in what has become the largest mass shooting in recent US history. \n\"People talk about machine guns being banned, but they're not,\" Laura Cutilletta, legal director for the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, told BuzzFeed News. Though some states have banned their sale altogether, she added, Nevada has not. \nUnder federal law, Cutilletta said, only automatic weapons made before May 19, 1986, are allowed to be sold, and all sales must be approved and registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, or ATF. \nThe federal restrictions have in effect priced these firearms out of the US market, putting them out of reach of most gun owners. Still, according to a 2017 ATF report, there are currently 630,019 automatic weapons registered with the federal agency, including 11,752 registered in the state of Nevada. \nAnd despite federal limits, it is relatively easy for someone in Nevada to make a semi-automatic rifle fire like an automatic weapon. \nThat's because the state has no restrictions on the sale of \"trigger cranks\" or \"bump fire\" devices, a relatively simple modification that allows the shooter to pull the trigger of an assault-rifle-style weapon much more rapidly, replicating the damage of an automatic weapon. \nOfficials told the Associated Press Monday that Paddock had two of these products, and that police are currently investigating whether he used them to modify the guns used in Sunday night's shooting. The devices can be purchased for an AR-15-style rifle online at a cost of anywhere between $250 and $350. \n\"I think that's something that will need to be addressed, whether or not it turns out that's what was used,\" Cutilletta said. \"The fact that's available and not addressed through legislation is a real loophole.\" \n\"If you're effectively making something a machine gun, you know, I think it's safe to say it should be regulated like one,\" she added. \nPaddock's arsenal of weapons also would not have been difficult to compile in Nevada, where there is no permit required of people purchasing firearms and no limit to how many weapons can be purchased at one time. \nThough background checks are conducted whenever someone purchases a weapon from a licensed dealer, advocates on both sides of the gun debate argue that such checks would not have stopped Sunday's massacre. \n\"The guy doesn't have a criminal history,\" Don Turner, president of the Nevada Firearms Association, a gun-rights advocacy group, told BuzzFeed News. \"Background checks would not have stopped this.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris carlson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher sullivan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "don turner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul laxalt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura cutilleta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cutilleta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen paddock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph lombardo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pin guns & guitars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national instant criminal background check", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buzzfeed news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "law center to prevent gun violence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bureau of alcohol, tobacco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada firearms association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandalay bay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mesquite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clark county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paddock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:35:29.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d9b1559d9688bf54075efbf0b8091de98f13a99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99G3d_U4hqkTQxy2Yp5oeOB9k1mnA4gmeWHISNMzcPAOdtDUThnOz2B5SVlBobbtRKABshMTCSe1CYYL54pREPPj.vIzU07FAq33jfLLzsNRZI-", "site_full": "www.buzzfeed.com", "site": "buzzfeed.com", "site_section": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/index.xml", "site_categories": ["homework_study_tips", "education"], "section_title": "BuzzFeed - Latest", "title": "How The Las Vegas Shooter May Have Turned His Assault Rifles Into Automatic Weapons", "title_full": "How The Las Vegas Shooter May Have Turned His Assault Rifles Into Automatic Weapons", "published": "2017-10-03T15:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-10/3/6/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/how-the-las-vegas-shooter-may-have-turned-his-ass-2-30512-1507027071-0_dblbig.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 137, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e5fdca9c00a995d51ca995dd3183f0ae2d0f332", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99G3d_U4hqkTQxy2Yp5oeOB9k1mnA4gmeWHISNMzcPAOdtDUThnOz2B5SVlBobbtRKABshMTCSe1CYYL54pREPPj.vIzU07FAq3.CPbutOagjI-", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Desiree Valenzuela", "published": "2017-10-03T14:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "There are how-to DIY manuals out there as well.

The audit will look at how people of different backgrounds are treated across various areas of the state, including health, education, employment, and the criminal justice system.\nIt will show huge differences in outcomes for ethnicities in different parts of the country, as well as significant disparities between different ethnic minority groups.\n\nMay said: \u201cIn doing this ground-breaking work we are holding a mirror up to our society. The idea itself is not new \u2013 Charles Booth\u2019s maps of rich and poor areas in Victorian London drew attention to hardship that was too often hidden \u2013 but this focus on how ethnicity affects people\u2019s lives will present findings that are uncomfortable.\"\n\nThe report has found employment rates are far higher for white people \u2013 75.7% \u2013 than for black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups \u2013 63.9% \u2013 across the country as a whole. It also shows that white pupils from state schools had the lowest university entry rate in 2016, and that more than 9 in 10 headteachers are white British.\nIt also shows that 2 in 3 white British householders own their home, though only 2 in 5 householders from any other ethnic group do.\nThe results are set to be published on a website, Ethnicity Facts and Figures, that will be set live on 10 October.\nThe prime minister is planning to set out targeted action in areas with large gaps in employment, including:\nExpanding successful mentoring programmes to help people into work.\nTargeting additional traineeship programmes to help young people. These offer English, Maths and vocational learning alongside a work placement to 16- to 24-year-olds to help them prepare for employment.\nWorking with employers large and small to help close the employment gap, including in identifying good recruitment practices. May said: \u201cMy most fundamental political belief is that how far you go in life should be based on your talent and how hard you work \u2013 and nothing else. Britain has come a long way in my lifetime in spreading equality and opportunity, but this Audit will be definitive evidence of how far we must still go in order to truly build a country that works for everyone.\u201d\n\nExperts working to address racial inequality in Britain have welcomed the audit, but said that it is only valuable if it leads to \"concrete change on the ground\", adding that concerted action needs to be taken to address the problem \u2013 not just by government, but also by employers and individuals.\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath said that \"race inequality is entrenched in our society and we need to stop deluding ourselves that it will somehow improve without sustained and coordinated effort on our part\", adding that \"we urgently need a comprehensive race strategy bringing in all parts of government to face these inequalities head on and ensure black and minority ethnic people are not left behind.\"\nDr Omar Khan, director of the race equality think tank the Runnymede Trust, said: \"We welcome the publication of the racial disparity audit and the commitment of the government to publish these data. The prime minister understands this is about action not just data.\n\n\"Addressing the problem will be a huge task but it is achievable with political will. Once the details of the audit are digested, we want to see a comprehensive and government-wide plan with the goal of eliminating racial barriers in a generation.\n\"Doing so will require joined-up government, but also action from employers, service providers and individuals, and the active engagement of black and minority ethnic communities.\"\nWhile Chris Murray, Research Fellow in the Migration Team at IPPR, added: \"It\u2019s obviously good to get more data on the different treatment of ethnic groups across a range of public services. But much of this we\u2019ve known for a long time.\n\"The real story is not that discrimination exists, but that not enough has been done to tackle it. Now we need action to get to the root of these disparities and close the gap between ethnic groups. That means tackling all types of disparity and inequality, including when White British people fall behind.\n\nHe went on: \u201cIPPR has called for a locally-led approach to tackling ethnic disparities in the labour market, giving local areas new powers and funding to help broker opportunities between young people and employers and address discrimination in recruitment practices.\n\"The Race Disparity Audit will be a useful step only if it leads to concrete change on the ground. Government \u2013 both national and local \u2013 must take serious action to address the inequalities the new data show. Because on its own, an audit changes nothing.\u201d\nDawn Butler MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities also criticised the fact that the audit was set to be published several months behind schedule.\n\"The delay in publishing this report is yet more evidence of a Government that is all talk and little action\", Butler said. \"Theresa May promised to publish the findings of this audit before summer 2017, but has instead sat on the data for months.\n\"I am glad the data I requested from the Prime Minister three months ago when Parliament was sitting will finally be published, but Theresa May has questions to answer on why it he taken so long to shine a light on the \"burning injustices\" she promised to address over a year ago.\n\"This morning, the Prime Minister said the audit's findings would prove difficult reading. When the report is published, it must be in a full and transparent manner and proposals must immediately be brought forward to tackle racial disparities.

Then we went into a dark barn type structure and I wondered what was coming next.

Posted on Share \nHome secretary Amber Rudd speaking on the third day of the Conservative party conference. \nThe family of a man injured in a London acid attack said the government's plan to ban the sale of acid to people under-18s will not be enough to bring an end to such crimes. \nCampaigners joined Afzal Ahmed's uncle in expressing concerns that the measures home secretary Amber Rudd announced at the Conservative conference in Manchester do not go far enough. \nShaynul Khan, whose 22-year-old nephew has been left with facial scarring, said the government had dragged its feet, and suggested Rudd should have taken a firmer stance by restricting acid purchases to licensed tradespeople. \nSpeaking to the conference on Tuesday afternoon, Rudd said the government will publish its consultation into reducing violent crime soon and that it will include measures such as banning people from carrying acid in public \"without a good reason\". \nThe home secretary said acid attacks had \"ruined lives\" and resulted in \"endless surgeries\", and that victims \"never fully recover\" from the attacks, which she described as \"absolutely revolting\". The government is currently considering the exact range of substances the new offence will cover. \nHowever, she specifically announced the intention to \"drastically limit\" the sale of sulphuric acid, which she said was used in the production of homemade explosives known as \"Mother of Satan\" devices. \nThe government believes the new offence will be similar to the existing offence of selling knives to a person under 18, which has a maximum prison sentence of six months and a possible fine. \nOn the ban on carrying acid in public places, the government said the onus would be on the person carrying the substance to prove they had a good reason for being in possession of it, similar to the existing offence on carrying knives. \nSpeaking to BuzzFeed News, Khan, whose nephew was left with life-changing injuries after being the victim of an acid attack in the summer in Bethnal Green, said the home secretary's announcement was welcome but there could have been faster action and reassuring of communities. Khan said he had written to Rudd, and that \"action was better than no action\". Share \nAfzal Ahmed whose life changed after he was attacked with acid in Bethnal Green. \nHe said the announcement constituted progress, but that 18 was \"probably not the best of ages\" to choose for the sales ban, \"because a lot of the perpetrators have been over the age of 18, and not many of them have been minors\". He agreed with the purchase of acids being restricted to certain trades: \"With acid attack it leaves a long lasting effect. You're going to live with scarring for the rest of your life.\" \nKhan said his nephew, who was a confident 22-year-old with a wife and young baby, is now uncomfortable to go to out in public and to family events and is not in work at the moment as he is uncomfortable with his facial scarring. He added that the psychological impact of the attack would last much longer. Share \nMotorcycle delivery drivers and motorcyclists take part in a demonstration in Parliament Square in central London on 18 July 2017, following a spate of acid attacks. \nJaf Shah, executive director of the Acid Survivors Trust International, said that while he welcomed the measures, the government had not gone far enough. \nHe told BuzzFeed News: \"I think it's a useful first step, but I think there's a lot more the government can be doing. The age restriction I think is important, but I think there also needs to be a licensing system and an end to cash sales, and a way to address the inconsistency in sentencing.\" \nShah also said the government needs to work with retailers \"around the corrosive content of many of the products on the market\". \nHe said the measures the government planned to introduce would not be enough alone to tackle the problem. \"It needs to be part of wider legal reform, legislation change,\" he said. \"The government needs to do more on the subject.\" \nShah said education work was key, to change the mindsets of those who are carrying acid, and that more research was needed to establish who would be most at risk of becoming a victim or a perpetrator. \n\"Who are the perpetrators?\" he said, \"What are the demographics, the motivations? Which areas of the UK and London are most affected? What are the demographics of perpetrators and victims?\" \nHe said he suspected preventative education work \"will mean working with particularly young boys and men, trying to change those ideas of masculinity, trying to bring about a change in attitudes, and that will require quite a bit of investment with children, schools, youth clubs.\" \nHe added: \"I think that the process of obtaining acid will still be relatively easy unless you introduce further regulation. I don't think these measures in isolation will be sufficient.\" \nDavid Videcette, a former Metropolitan police detective with a background in fighting organised crime, told BuzzFeed News said the age restrictions would have less impact than making carrying acid a criminal offence in itself. \nHe said: \"Amber Rudd's intention to restrict the sale of acids to over 18s is unlikely to have much of an impact on acid attacks, simply because most of the acid attacks that we see are committed by adults, but he added that \"her intention to make carrying acid in a public place without reasonable excuse is a positive one\". \nHe said the changes \"will dramatically increase police powers to combat those found with acid on the streets\", explaining that at present when police find someone with acid in public places, they have to prove someone's intent for it to be a criminal offence. \n\"I also applaud her for trying to completely restrict the sale of sulphuric acid, which is a precursor material of explosives, and has been used to make explosives here in the UK\" he added. \"This acid is mainly used to make fertiliser products - we should be looking to license the possession of this product and make it harder to terrorists to gain possession of it.\" \nGavin Hales, associate fellow and former deputy director of think tank the Police Foundation, told BuzzFeed News he was \"wondering out loud how the proposed law relates to the problem it is intended to address\". \nHe said: \"The kinds of questions that need asking include: What percentage of attackers are in fact under 18, and of those that are, (a) what substances are they using, and (b) where are they getting them? \n\"Without the answers to these questions, it's rather difficult to know if the proposed law goes 'far enough'. It's worth saying that the ban on the sale of most knives to under-18s hasn't stopped knife crime \u2013 but also that we don't, as far as I'm aware, know how much if any difference it has made to rates of knife crime committed by under-18s. Of course, knives are available in every house. It's a very different story with guns, where supply is heavily constrained.\" \nThere was also scepticism on social media, with commentators saying the measures by themselves will not put a stop to acid attacks.

Guardian, The Hill, McClatchy, BuzzFeed News, and others wanted answers. What is the Scaramucci Post ? Why does it tweet bizarre Twitter polls and endless emojis? After a day of horrific news coming out of Las Vegas, why do we care?\n\u201cI am looking you dead in the face and saying I don't know,\u201d Scaramucci told reporters, when asked about what the new media project will be.\n\u201cI just want to make sure I\u2019m describing this right as I use words,\u201d one reporter in the scrum said. \u201cIf I describe it as a social media news platform\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSay Scaramucci has absolutely no idea what he\u2019s doing,\u201d he interjected, \u201cand he has absolutely no idea what Scaramucci Post is.\u201d\nEven in half-jest, Scaramucci still sounded like a conventional digital media executive: The ScarPo is, in his telling, an advertising-supported, politically centrist, millennial-focused news outlet distributed natively on social media platforms. There will be livestreaming. There will be discussions with political influencers. And he may even hire reporters down the road.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a social media, Periscoping, experiential thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI may drop some articles on the Twitter feed that I like. No landing page. On Twitter, Instagram.\u201d\nThese are\u2026kind of the right buzzwords? And in true media launch form, Scaramucci even showcased his first advertiser, a new women\u2019s sports site called Knockout Times . \u201cIf I get four or five more sponsors, I'll be converting this thing into a website,\u201d he said.\nAs for editorial ethos: \u201cI think that there\u2019s a wide-open space in the middle that is not being served,\u201d Scaramucci told reporters gathered around him. \u201cIt\u2019s the Walter Cronkite space. It\u2019s the space in the middle where there's a level of objectivity.\u201d\nScaramucci was also asked about a recent BuzzFeed News report that he had told friends, in writing, that he wants to run for president or governor of New York someday. Scaramucci, whose correspondence was obtained by BuzzFeed News after he called the original report \u201cfake news,\u201d once again denied he has elected office ambitions. And anyway, he told me on Monday night that media was more his thing: \u201cI see myself as a TV host.\u201d\nSince Scaramucci got booted from the White House after he told the New Yorker that Steve Bannon likes to \u201csuck [his] own cock,\u201d he has hosted an episode of TMZ\u2019s live show; he went on The View alongside his actor doppelganger, Mario Cantone, and suggested that Bannon is a white nationalist; he announced the launch of the Scaramucci Post with a series of polls about just who the account should follow next, often selecting well-known people in the media; and he hosted this would-be party for a group of New York reporters in the basement of his own restaurant, a charade of sorts, where Scaramucci reflected on topics like gerrymandering and the moon landing.\nReporters weren\u2019t quite sure what they had witnessed. We knew we were at the Hunt & Fish Club with Anthony Scaramucci. We knew that Scaramucci is working on some sort of media outlet.\nAnd we understood, I think, that Scaramucci shrewdly knows the best way to keep the media\u2019s attention is to become part of the media.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/politics/redistricting-supreme-court/index.html", "https://twitter.com/ScaramucciPost", "https://www.knockouttimes.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anthony scaramucci", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mcclatchy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walter cronkite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scaramucci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mario cantone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knockout times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buzzfeed news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hunt & fish club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scaramucci post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:21:00.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6f417854cc6fed43df1dfc0c82e3e8703adf3adc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99GxqMozWq9Ea.RhuMjsNlIQ5zzDW2X3AblIhxw1gNGiNBSkUzrmS97dRV_0EPMZ5Qnc._dbF8XN7Y-", "site_full": "www.buzzfeed.com", "site": "buzzfeed.com", "site_section": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/index.xml", "site_categories": ["homework_study_tips", "education"], "section_title": "BuzzFeed - Latest", "title": "38 Of The Funniest Pictures In Internet History", "title_full": "38 Of The Funniest Pictures In Internet History", "published": "2017-10-03T21:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-10/2/5/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-17148-1506938025-5.jpg?crop=1439:753;5,1015", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 137, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "daf26e94c4154f002988d99419e2f1ee8f56490a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99GxqMozWq9Ea.RhuMjsNlIQ5zzDW2X3AblIhxw1gNGiNBSkUzrmS97dRV_0EPMZ5QnsfbucW0ddyQUx5khRPlL1w--", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "Michael Munger", "published": "2017-10-03T16:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "Stephanie Creede so you bought your mom TWO birthday cakes?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:21:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6c911c3d0f40bb044f412c4b6581226ef39b398", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99G3zTgKxYGWz2QYNVtOPP2boAbJLyG2q8Z2RXeupY9NbhmeOlaRqaXC21nuXBQZg4j", "site_full": "www.buzzfeed.com", "site": "buzzfeed.com", "site_section": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/index.xml", "site_categories": ["homework_study_tips", "education"], "section_title": "BuzzFeed - Latest", "title": "Miley Cyrus Honoured The Las Vegas Victims By Performing \"The Climb\" For The First Time In Six Years", "title_full": "Miley Cyrus Honoured The Las Vegas Victims By Performing \"The Climb\" For The First Time In Six Years", "published": "2017-10-03T17:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-10/3/2/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/original-5864-1507013832-4.jpg?crop=1007:527;0,0", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 137, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b152952ed639fa4a89b46941f2d693e78e2e16e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99G3zTgKxYGWz2QYNVtOPP2boAbJLyG2q8Z2RXeupY9NbhmeOlaRqaXC45B93SO8jMjpB4k1prCDZY-", "ord_in_thread": 10, "author": "Queen lewis", "published": "2017-10-03T16:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "i was raised Catholic, I loved my man so much and devoted myself to him and he didn\u2019t love me back the same way.

Posted on Share \nOn Monday night, Anthony Scaramucci invited friends, publicists, and reporters to the basement of the Hunt & Fish Club, his swanky New York restaurant, to announce the launch of a cryptic new media venture, the Scaramucci Post. \nThe New York Times, The Guardian, The Hill, McClatchy, BuzzFeed News, and others wanted answers. What is the Scaramucci Post ? Why does it tweet bizarre Twitter polls and endless emojis? After a day of horrific news coming out of Las Vegas, why do we care? \n\u201cI am looking you dead in the face and saying I don't know,\u201d Scaramucci told reporters, when asked about what the new media project will be. \n\u201cI just want to make sure I\u2019m describing this right as I use words,\u201d one reporter in the scrum said. \u201cIf I describe it as a social media news platform\u2014\u201d \n\u201cSay Scaramucci has absolutely no idea what he\u2019s doing,\u201d he interjected, \u201cand he has absolutely no idea what Scaramucci Post is.\u201d \nEven in half-jest, Scaramucci still sounded like a conventional digital media executive: The ScarPo is, in his telling, an advertising-supported, politically centrist, millennial-focused news outlet distributed natively on social media platforms. There will be livestreaming. There will be discussions with political influencers. And he may even hire reporters down the road. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a social media, Periscoping, experiential thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI may drop some articles on the Twitter feed that I like. No landing page. On Twitter, Instagram.\u201d \nThese are\u2026kind of the right buzzwords? And in true media launch form, Scaramucci even showcased his first advertiser, a new women\u2019s sports site called Knockout Times . \u201cIf I get four or five more sponsors, I'll be converting this thing into a website,\u201d he said. \nAs for editorial ethos: \u201cI think that there\u2019s a wide-open space in the middle that is not being served,\u201d Scaramucci told reporters gathered around him. \u201cIt\u2019s the Walter Cronkite space. It\u2019s the space in the middle where there's a level of objectivity.\u201d \nScaramucci was also asked about a recent BuzzFeed News report that he had told friends, in writing, that he wants to run for president or governor of New York someday. Scaramucci, whose correspondence was obtained by BuzzFeed News after he called the original report \u201cfake news,\u201d once again denied he has elected office ambitions. And anyway, he told me on Monday night that media was more his thing: \u201cI see myself as a TV host.\u201d \nSince Scaramucci got booted from the White House after he told the New Yorker that Steve Bannon likes to \u201csuck [his] own cock,\u201d he has hosted an episode of TMZ\u2019s live show; he went on The View alongside his actor doppelganger, Mario Cantone, and suggested that Bannon is a white nationalist; he announced the launch of the Scaramucci Post with a series of polls about just who the account should follow next, often selecting well-known people in the media; and he hosted this would-be party for a group of New York reporters in the basement of his own restaurant, a charade of sorts, where Scaramucci reflected on topics like gerrymandering and the moon landing. \nReporters weren\u2019t quite sure what they had witnessed. We knew we were at the Hunt & Fish Club with Anthony Scaramucci. We knew that Scaramucci is working on some sort of media outlet. \nAnd we understood, I think, that Scaramucci shrewdly knows the best way to keep the media\u2019s attention is to become part of the media.
