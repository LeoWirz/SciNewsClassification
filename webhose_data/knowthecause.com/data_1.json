It is also suspected to lower sperm count. It can be found in some kinds of tortilla and bread products, but also in some dairy and meat products. Other names it goes under: propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, propyl, parahydroxybenzoate, nipasol, E216 \nSodium Benzoate This common preservative is used in sauerkraut and hot sauces, but it has been linked to hyperactivity. Sometimes, it goes under the names benzoic acid, benzoate, or potassium benzoate. \nSodium Nitrite/Nitrate This common additive is often found in bacon, hot dogs, lunch meats, smoked meats, and other types of cured meats. It keeps meat a bright red color. Attempts have been made to ban this additive, all of which have been fought by the meat industry, despite the fact that these have been linked to damaged liver, pancreas, and is carcinogenic. \nSodium Sulfite This preservative can be found in dried fruit. It has been linked to headaches, breathing problems and rashes. It might also be complicit in causing asthma. \nSulfur Dioxide This preservative can be found in some dried fruits and has been linked to asthma, and hypotension.

BHA/BHT These two preservatives are sometimes found in frozen sausages and chewing gum. These are used to prevent color change, rancidity, and flavor change. These are linked to neurological problems and are likely carcinogenic. \nPropyl Paraben Propyl paraben is an endocrine (hormone) disruptor that has been linked to infertility in women and breast cancer. It is also suspected to lower sperm count. It can be found in some kinds of tortilla and bread products, but also in some dairy and meat products. Other names it goes under: propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, propyl, parahydroxybenzoate, nipasol, E216 \nSodium Benzoate This common preservative is used in sauerkraut and hot sauces, but it has been linked to hyperactivity. Sometimes, it goes under the names benzoic acid, benzoate, or potassium benzoate. \nSodium Nitrite/Nitrate This common additive is often found in bacon, hot dogs, lunch meats, smoked meats, and other types of cured meats. It keeps meat a bright red color. Attempts have been made to ban this additive, all of which have been fought by the meat industry, despite the fact that these have been linked to damaged liver, pancreas, and is carcinogenic. \nSodium Sulfite This preservative can be found in dried fruit. It has been linked to headaches, breathing problems and rashes. It might also be complicit in causing asthma. \nSulfur Dioxide This preservative can be found in some dried fruits and has been linked to asthma, and hypotension. It is considered toxic and is prohibited in the United States for use in raw fruits and vegetables. It is linked to bronchial problems and anaphylactic shock. It also destroys vitamins B1 and E.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david holland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug kaufmann", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "these common food additives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaufmann diet", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T10:34:17.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f6a64191900b1617b9a21c0123584d80b7c85f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.WA6QAdxS7zOlN_S0A66kwYQZGy3.RocRSLtqKslpQOt8UFqqbKkEzRDt66LfBdcelryZtOa4mTfMRXhvzQcXN_zW5s8QnMV8BLU8BlhVAvrQ--", "site_full": "knowthecause.com", "site": "knowthecause.com", "site_section": "http://knowthecause.com/index.php?format=feed&type=rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Home", "title": "Can Fungus Cause Sleep Disorders?", "title_full": "Can Fungus Cause Sleep Disorders?", "published": "2017-10-18T13:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://knowthecause.com/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f6a64191900b1617b9a21c0123584d80b7c85f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.WA6QAdxS7zOlN_S0A66kwYQZGy3.RocRSLtqKslpQOt8UFqqbKkEzRDt66LfBdcelryZtOa4mTfMRXhvzQcXN_zW5s8QnMV8BLU8BlhVAvrQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "contactus@knowthecause.com (Doug Kaufmann)", "published": "2017-10-18T13:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can Fungus Cause Sleep Disorders?", "text": "Danger lies in observing the effect and believing it was the cause. Such, I believe, is the case here. Imagine the joy that these 6 doctors experienced upon completing this research paper! Not only had they pinpointed the exact brain tissue to inject, but the injection also created tiny lesions, and those sores had somehow made these eight cats insomniacs! Do you see where I\u2019m headed? In fact, the \u201ceffect\u201d was actually the lesions that the injection provoked. The \u201ccause\u201d, however, was the ibotenic acid injection; the cause was actually fungal in origin! Ibotenic acid is a mycotoxin produced by the Amanita mushroom. Scientists call ibotenic acid a \u201cbrain lesioning agent\u201d because of its neurotoxicity. It was the ibotenic acid that induced the insomnia! Fungus (Amanita mushrooms) make mycotoxins (ibotenic acid) and some are neurotoxic, as is the case here. The effect of the mycotoxins being injected was severe insomnia. So now, let\u2019s rewrite the headline: Severe insomnia induced in cats when fungal mycotoxin is injected into anterior hypothalamus, thereby producing lesions. Perhaps not to the well trained scientist, but what this headline now tells me is that fungus (mycotoxins are nonexistent without fungus) causes me to lay awake in bed night after night. \nThis is the newest recipe book for the Kaufmann diet and includes more healthy recipes along with helpful hints on cooking and dietary changes. You or someone you love has likely had insomnia. It is likely they have unsuccessfully tried medications that marketers promise will make butterflies land on their windowsills. And even if this works for them, the side effect list seems endless. All they want to do is sleep! Here is a partial list of side effects of one of the best selling sleep medications: Walking, eating, driving or engaging in other activities while asleep without remembering it the next day have been reported. Other abnormal behaviors include aggressiveness, agitation, hallucinations and confusion. In depressed patients, worsening of depression including risk of suicide may occur. These risks may increase if you drink alcohol. Severe allergic reactions such as swelling of the tongue and throat occur rarely and may be fatal. Natural Remedies for Insomnia With side effects like these, I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to further investigate the cause of your insomnia. Talk to your doctor about using natural alternatives first and see if those work for you. One is called, Invigorest. Look it up online, but please know that I have a conflict of interest in telling you about this product, because the company that makes it available to you is a beloved advertiser of mine. Another combination that may work for you is L-Tryptophan and its co-nutrient, pyridoxine, or Vitamin B6 . Of course, amino acids are anti-fungal , so this may explain why natural products might work so well to induce relaxation. But based on the opening research in this article, a changed diet might be just what the doctor needed to order. While working clinically through the years with so many open-minded doctors (it took them about 4-6 months of working with me and seeing incredible results to become open minded), we discovered together that evening exercise for 15-25 minutes and a diet that excluded grains, alcohols and sugars often contributed to a nights sleep like they had never remembered having. Yes, fungus can cause insomnia and it should surprise none of us that so many of these fungal poisons can affect the nervous systems. Is it any wonder that so many Americans run from cardiologist to cardiologist hoping to find one that knows the cause of their irregular heartbeats? Some recommend a glass of alcohol before bed. Do they even know that alcohol is the neurotoxic mycotoxin of Brewer's Yeast? It may well help for 3 or 4 nights, until the mycotoxins impregnate the brain. Then, instead of the solution, alcohol becomes the problem, unbeknownst to anyone. Please exercise caution when being handed any medication that purports to fix what ails you. Tell your doctor that you want to exhaust safer means of falling asleep initially, but you\u2019d be open to using medications if absolutely warranted. Know that there are 661,400 American physicians, but don\u2019t be surprised if yours doesn\u2019t know about the fungus link to insomnia; he/she is not alone. There must be 17 or 18 physicians that would know this information. If insurance companies reimbursed counting sheep, you absolutely know that it would become the most popular and most prescribed sleep aid in the world! Think fungus, but give it a good 60-day trial before making the final decision.

There are certain ways, however, that might make you more vulnerable to exposing yourself to mold toxins, all of which you should try to avoid for the sake of maintaining health. Certain Foods Certain foods are known to be commonly tainted with mold poisons. These include corn, peanuts, grains like wheat, soy, pistachios and other types of agricultural products. These foods are at risk for being infested with fungi, largely due to being kept in a silo for long periods of time. If you regularly consume these foods, or foods made from these ingredients, such as bread, pasta, corn chips, peanut butter or soy products, you are likely exposing yourself to mold toxins regularly.

For those of us who have been with him awhile, I can tell you that his philosophy has a way of hitting you in waves rather than all at once. I remember the first time I spent time with Doug was when I was interviewing him on my radio show in Oklahoma City. He was in the studio with me, and we were doing the show just before he was speaking to a crowd of a couple thousand people later that morning. I was so nervous that I couldn\u2019t really remember my own name, the name of the show, or what I should talk to him about. I looked down at a rare set of questions that I just happened to write up the night before. The answer to the question I asked him represents one of the waves of understanding that has hit me. How Many Natural Antifungal Supplements Are There? \nI asked Doug, \u201cAbout how many anti-fungals are at the health food store where you\u2019ll be speaking?\u201d I expected him to say that there were a dozen or so. \nDoug looked up, paused for a moment and said, \u201cOh\u2026 hundreds\u2026THOUSANDS! \u201d \nI had no idea what he was talking about and asked him to elaborate. He began sharing how most vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, herbs, spices, essential fats, and probiotics contain at least mild anti-fungal activity. \nI sat in stunned silence for a moment, forgetting that I was the host, not an audience member. I stammered a bit and went to a commercial. \nDuring the break, I asked him if I understood him correctly \u2013 that it\u2019s not just things like oregano oil, caprylic acid, curcumin, and olive leaf that are anti-fungal , but LOADS of nutrients that are. \u201cYou bet!\u201d \nSuddenly, things that I had heard him talk about on TV began falling into place. Is Fungus The Real Reason Tobacco Is Harmful? \nJust as there are many, many nutrients that you may not realize have antifungal activity, there are also many, many ways to which we\u2019re exposed to fungus and their poisons. \nFor example, everyone knows that smoking cigarettes may not be the best idea for our long-term health. The American Lung Association reports that there are over 600 ingredients in cigarettes, and when lit, those transform into over 4000 chemicals. They say that at least 50 of these are cancer-causing. A few of them include acetone (nail polish remover), lead, tar, and formaldehyde, (embalming fluid). \nBut what isn\u2019t reported as widely is the processing of cigarette tobacco, which invites fungal overgrowth. Tobacco is commonly dipped into sugar and allowed to dry. Cigarette paper, itself, is often coated with sugar, purportedly to prevent bitterness. Any fungus that is growing on that tobacco will certainly find a ready food source with all of this sugar. And where there is a fungus, you can bet that there will be mycotoxins, (fungal poisons), which are resistant to heat and cold. But does tobacco contain fungus? According to the journal, Tobacco Induced Diseases, the answer is yes. Such fungi have left behind such mycotoxins as muramic acid and ergosterol. The Journal reports that when finished cigarettes are stored in a humid environment, the elevated levels of fungi that grow on the tobacco also leads to higher concentrations of mycotoxins. you may never have heard of the fungal link to smoking dangers \nA sister journal reports that these mycotoxins are definitely found in the smoke of cigarettes, affecting both the smoker, as well as those around cigarette smoke. The disease-causing effects of ergosterol have been documented as far back as 1930 in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, while studies on muramic acid have shown an association between this poison and meningitis. One study even found that aflatoxin, (one of the most notorious cancer-causing mycotoxins ever identified), was detected in the filters of cigarettes! \nSo, while there is a multitude of good reasons to avoid smoking, you may never have heard of the fungal link to smoking dangers. Alcohol, Itself, Is a Fungal Poison \nWhat about alcohol? Is it considered safer, especially in light of the recommendations to enjoy an occasional alcoholic beverage for health? Well\u2026 maybe not. Just as many antibiotics are actual fungal poisons, (mycotoxins), so also is alcohol a mycotoxin. Every time alcohol is created, fungus/yeast has a role to play in the fermentation of the sugars in grains and fruits. \nSimply put, consuming alcohol is quite literally drinking a glass of mycotoxins \u2013 mycotoxins which are known to cause cell damage, (cell poisoning), in the body. \nTo understand the first damaging effect of alcohol in the body, one must have a sense of how alcohol is formed. As Doug Haney puts it, \u201cAll alcohol products are created as a result of the war waged between molds, yeasts, and bacteria.\u201d As these microbes begin competing for food, the molds and yeasts are induced to excrete their bio-weapon: Alcohol. The alcohol helps eliminate bacteria, allowing the fungi freer access to the food sources. \nThe same thing is happening in the body when alcohol is consumed. According to Dr. John Heritage, Senior Microbiology Lecturer at the University of Leeds, human beings are only about 10% human; the rest are microbial. What he means is that we have more germ critters in and around our bodies than we have actual human cells! (Yuck!) \nSome of these microbes are helpful, and others aren\u2019t. We need a HUGE number of good-guy microbes, (what we call \u201cprobiotics\u201d), to help with digestion, immunity, the manufacturing of vitamins, and a number of other crucial processes. \nUnder normal, healthy conditions, there is a proper balance of good-guy germs populating our bodies. But if conditions change, the population can favor harmful forms of microbes. This is the beginning of getting into health trouble. When alcohol is consumed, the mycotoxin goes about killing off bacteria in the body. \n(This can be helpful. For example, think of the centuries of warfare injuries that were treated with a good, strong pouring of alcohol on wounds. Some people even like using strong spirits in their spray bottles at home for surface cleaning.) But when we constantly consume alcohol, what happens to our good-guy bacteria in the gut? They\u2019re vulnerable to the anti-bacterial effects of the alcohol and can be killed off if the concentration of the alcohol is high enough, and if it is consumed often enough. \nWhen the good bacteria are eliminated, disease-causing yeast has an opportunity to overgrow. \nAnd this is only Step One to the kind of damage that alcohol and saddle us with. One of the first metabolites created after consuming alcohol is another mycotoxin called acetaldehyde. According to Dr. AV Costantini, it\u2019s poison to human cells. It\u2019s broken down by an enzyme in the liver, but if the liver is undernourished or underperforming and isn\u2019t producing enough of this enzyme, the acetaldehyde can become toxic, especially to the liver. \nIn a 1992 article, Dr. Garro lists some consequences from the body constantly being called upon to metabolize this mycotoxin. Among them are: Damage to cells, and damage to the process of cell division. Decreased ability to detoxify poisonous chemicals in the body. Inability to repair damaged DNA. Suppressing the immune response. \nThese are just a few of the effects that come about as a result of simply requiring the body to constantly metabolize alcohol. (And every time you say alcohol, think \u201cfungal poison\u201d.) \nThe liver is a constant target for alcohol\u2019s damaging effects. We all know about alcohol-induced cirrhosis of the liver. Dr. Anna M. Diehl says this about alcohol and the liver: \"The liver is the only vital organ able to regenerate after damage. Alcohol not only causes liver damage, but it also appears to impair liver regeneration. Therefore, people with alcohol-related liver damage who continue to drink decrease their chances of recovery.\u201d \nThese are just a few of the effects that the most oft-consumed fungal poison in the world can cause. We haven\u2019t even scratched the surface, especially when we consider the obvious brain-altering effects of alcohol, including its neural cell paralyzing effects. \nChlorinated Tap Water, Birth-Control Pills, Diet \nSo, imagine a person who drinking chlorinated tap water. The chlorine can kill bad AND good bacteria. \nMaybe this person takes birth control pills or anti-inflammatory steroids, such as a prednisone derivative. More good-guy bacterial killing. They wash their hands with anti-bacterial soap. More good-guy bacterial killing. Perhaps the doctor prescribed (and prescribed, and prescribed, and prescribed\u2026) antibiotics (mycotoxins) for mild infections. HUGE good-guy bacterial killing. \nCooking Your Way To Good Health This is the newest recipe book for the Kaufmann diet and includes more healthy recipes along with helpful hints on cooking and dietary changes. \nAnd on top of all of this probiotic slaughter, this person ends each evening with a couple of glasses of alcohol, (suggested by the same doctor that overly prescribed the antibiotics earlier). \nWhat do you think the sum total of all those anti-bacterial forces could be? Possible disaster? It\u2019s certainly possible, especially if the person is eating a Standard American Diet, never consuming any probiotic-rich foods or supplements, and continuing a chronic exposure to anti-bacterials, including alcohol. \nIf this does happen, the stripping of our good bacteria removes one of our first lines of defense against serious fungal overgrowth, as well as our source of many of our crucial nutrients. \nDon\u2019t Be Scared; Just Know The Cause \nI don\u2019t say this to scare you off every drop of alcohol forever and ever. I say it to re-establish in our minds how often our lives are potentially touched by fungus and fungal toxins. I want us to be reminded both of the plethora of fungal-borne health complications that science has identified, as well the myriad of anti-fungal nutritional defenses you have against them . \nThe best thing I can tell you is that the effects of fungus are additive. Each fungal assault you can systematically, gradually remove helps. Each Anti-fungal, nutritive weapon you add helps. With a real sense of the assaults and weapons you have available, you can easily recognize your areas of vulnerabilities and strengths. \nMinimize your weakness, maximize your strengths, and watch what happens!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "doug kaufmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaufmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "av costantini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna m. diehl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug haney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john heritage", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "real reason alcohol and tobacco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of leeds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "standard american diet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american lung association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tobacco induced diseases", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oklahoma city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-24T10:06:18.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f36340ddde0090c62487ffef4df460b9f722e308", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.WA6QAdxS7zOlN_S0A66kwYQZGy3.RocRS_WLyd1LQNryGT7iav2qZcU16a.diYjzpmbhfso2AaqsfrgbCjsQfJ49edQKKdesQt4cP4GKsR7350iHrjiOciBEtnE1Yxs22CfWIUsPF.Ff1u3Co6r1J2Vqm7AIMCIwg-", "site_full": "knowthecause.com", "site": "knowthecause.com", "site_section": "http://knowthecause.com/index.php?format=feed&type=atom", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Home", "title": "Is This The Real Reason Alcohol and Tobacco Are Harmful?", "title_full": "Is This The Real Reason Alcohol and Tobacco Are Harmful?", "published": "2017-10-24T13:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://knowthecause.com/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f36340ddde0090c62487ffef4df460b9f722e308", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.WA6QAdxS7zOlN_S0A66kwYQZGy3.RocRS_WLyd1LQNryGT7iav2qZcU16a.diYjzpmbhfso2AaqsfrgbCjsQfJ49edQKKdesQt4cP4GKsR7350iHrjiOciBEtnE1Yxs22CfWIUsPF.Ff1u3Co6r1J2Vqm7AIMCIwg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kyle Drew (kyle_drew@hotmail.com)", "published": "2017-10-24T13:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is This The Real Reason Alcohol and Tobacco Are Harmful?", "text": "| Print | \nIf you\u2019re new to Doug Kaufmann\u2019s message of linking fungus to disease, welcome aboard. For those of us who have been with him awhile, I can tell you that his philosophy has a way of hitting you in waves rather than all at once. I remember the first time I spent time with Doug was when I was interviewing him on my radio show in Oklahoma City. He was in the studio with me, and we were doing the show just before he was speaking to a crowd of a couple thousand people later that morning. I was so nervous that I couldn\u2019t really remember my own name, the name of the show, or what I should talk to him about.

It is around this time of the year we are told to get the flu shot, reminded to wash our hands regularly, and be mindful of what surfaces we touch. Some might take issue with getting the flu shot\u2013\u2013notably because the flu shot is manufactured to reflect the best guess of epidemiologists on which strain of the flu is going to be the most pervasive. Simply put, getting a flu shot in no way guarantees that one will not get the flu. Many would seek to simply avoid it all together. The other advice we are given is all well and good, but there must be more we can do to avoid getting sick. It is likely a good idea to maintain your best health through healthy diet, regular exercise, and regularly getting enough sleep. But when you want an added immune boost, trying any combinations of these daily supplements may assist you in staying healthy through the fall. Beta Glucans Beta glucans are potent immune modulators . Beta-glucans do not kill germs directly, but they work with your body\u2019s immune system. Simply put, beta glucans give your immune system the extra infection-fighting power it needs to protect your body from incoming pathogens. Many varieties are available at health food stores, but the NSC brand is likely the best available. Their patented processes micronize's the beta glucan molecules so that they are the most bioavailable. Vitamin C Vitamin C is an old standby for immune health, and there is a good deal of evidence to back its use. Vitamin C is readily available in many of the foods on the Kaufmann Diet , such as lemons, limes, spinach, bell peppers, broccoli and kale, and getting vitamin C from your food is never a bad thing. However, keeping extra vitamin C in supplement form around during the fall is a good idea; making sure you get not just the recommended daily allowance (RDA) but a supplemental dose of vitamin C is a good way to keep your immune system primed when bugs are going around. \nThe Fungus Link Vol 1 \nBoth Doug Kaufmann and David Holland, MD discuss topics such as chronic fatigue syndrome, arthritis, intestinal disorders, allergies, respiratory illness, \u201cbrain fog\u201d syndrome, depression, and chronic skin conditions. This book includes the assessment of antifungal supplements and antifungal prescriptive drugs as well as the Antifungal program and diets. Ginger Ginger root has a flavor that lends itself to fall; it\u2019s potential to keep you healthy during flu season is just an added benefit. Ginger has a legion of uses and benefits, among them is its ability to calm an upset stomach. Ginger, however, is a powerful anti-fungal and anti-microbial, too. Adding some raw ginger to your morning smoothie or juice might give you the added edge to stay well through fall. Rotating Natural Anti-fungals Rotating anti-fungal supplements is important; in the same way that bacteria grow resistant to antibiotics, fungi can grow resistant to Anti-fungal supplements. Rotating Anti-fungal supplements gives pathogenic fungi less of a chance to grow resistant and can help keep them in check.

Halloween qualifies as one of the tougher holidays for those of us who not only want great health for ourselves, but also for our children. \nI remember the first time my son had chocolate. It was during a holiday, and we had kept it from him his whole life. But a family member walked up and gave him a little bite of chocolate, and we could see it in his eyes\u2026magic. We knew this was the new taste he wasn\u2019t going to get out of his head easily. \nA funny thing happened over the course of his life, though. He had the chocolate, and it wasn\u2019t his last. But he isn\u2019t a slave to it. He doesn\u2019t like soda. On Halloween, it\u2019s more fun for him to be with friends than it is for him to sort through candy. In fact, he usually gives most of it away. Each year, the Halloween he has in his candy sack is almost entirely there a year later. \nAnother funny thing is that he walks around with a sober-minded attitude about sweets and treats. We decided not to use fear as our educating principle. \nHe knows Doug\u2019s fungus message and actually has a fascination with how it all works. He sort of takes that mindset with him into any holiday, getaway, or place where there\u2019s going to be a plethora of junk offered. Amazingly, he just grabs a piece or two of the treat, enjoys it, (usually he asks for a blood sugar supplement, like cinnamon or chromium pic before eating it), and then moves on. His mindset is so much better than mine was at his age. He just quietly enjoys a bite and then imagines the fungi multiplying in his body if he were to go much further with it than the tiny pleasure bite. That, alone, usually prevents him from going any further with the feasting. \nI\u2019d love to tell you that we have this grand plan for how to keep all children away from junk food forever and ever, but I don\u2019t. But I do think there are a few things to keep in mind when navigating through holidays\u2026and every day. Fear Equals Failure \nThere\u2019s a natural health newsletter I get each week, and every single subject line arrives with some horror story. \u201cThis Common Food Gives Everyone Cancer.\u201d \u201cFive Reasons Why You\u2019ll Die If You Expose Yourself To This Common Household Cleaner.\u201d \nI\u2019m exaggerating\u2026a little bit. But it really is true that fear is used more than anything else to try to persuade people to change their behavior. \nI don\u2019t believe in using fear. I do think it\u2019s a good idea to talk about potential consequences for certain actions or thoughts. But it just sets the wrong tone for how one should think about things. \nI also see well-meaning parents cast extraordinarily negative thoughts onto their children, like: \u201cFine! You\u2019re going to get a shot at the dentist\u2019s office now.\u201d \u201cNobody likes fat kids.\u201d \u201cSee? That\u2019s what you get for\u2026\u2026\u201d \nI think it\u2019s awful to thrust that on children. It\u2019s like a curse. \nI understand talking about potential consequences. But when we shame them and cause them to identify with a possible consequence, it's damaging, in my opinion. \u201cWho can recover from a broken spirit?\u201d \nEducate. Talk about behaviors. But don\u2019t break their spirits just because they like the taste of candy. Enjoy! Just Don\u2019t Overwhelm \nParents\u2026If a child has a bit of candy one day out of the month, it\u2019s not the end of the world. Even the Bible says, \u201cHave you found honey? Eat only what you need, lest you vomit it up.\u201d \nNow, it\u2019s one thing if a person is fighting a life-threatening illness. In those cases, we like to keep things as untainted as possible. But for otherwise healthy individuals, it\u2019s not what you do one day out of a month that counts. It\u2019s what you do all the time. \nThink about it this way. What if you wanted to lose some weight. If you ate well and exercised only one day out of the month, would you see much progress? Of course not. \nWhen we\u2019re talking about great health, we have to think about what we do most of the time, not once in a great while. And by the same token, we shouldn\u2019t take an occasion for a sweet treat and turn it into a no-holds-barred gorge-fest. Be good to yourself. Enjoy a bit\u2026but don\u2019t overwhelm yourself. \nIf There Are Decent Alternatives, Have Those Instead This is obvious, but it bears repeating. Know the Cause has lots of dessert recipes that allow you the pleasures of sweetness, but without the consequences. \nCooking Your Way To Good Health This is the newest recipe book for the Kaufmann diet and includes more healthy recipes along with helpful hints on cooking and dietary changes. \nOn Halloween, it\u2019s a little different, though. As a parent, if someone gave my child a dessert item that they said they made, and wrapped it up and gave it to him, I\u2019m sorry but I wouldn\u2019t let him eat it. I hate that we\u2019re living in an era where people\u2019s homemade items aren\u2019t trusted, but that\u2019s just the reality nowadays. Most parent\u2019s worry about something that could be slipped into an unsealed muffin or baked good. It may be fantastic, but most parents just won\u2019t be comfortable accepting those kinds of treats, thoughtful as they may be. \nI do see more and more candy items at the health food stores that are sweetened with xylitol, erythritol, and stevia. I say go for it! If it\u2019s affordable, it would be great to give those as treats rather than the corn syrup-laden stuff we normally see. And if you just want some for yourself, these are great alternatives to everything that\u2019s out there. Post-Halloween Strategies \nEven with so little candy in our household, we still do a few things after Halloween to mitigate against possible fungal overgrowth from sugar. \n1 ). Try a little chlorophyll for the next week or so. Whether it\u2019s in the form of actual greens or straight chlorophyll, I love this green nutritive because it has been shown to neutralize some of the nastier known mycotoxins. \n2 ). The night of Halloween, if anyone has indulged too much, activated charcoal has a way of sopping up toxins. It must be done on an empty stomach, particularly if you take medicines or supplements because charcoal can grab up absolutely everything! Follow directions for children\u2019s dosing. \n3 ). Make the day after a banner nutrition day. Go all-in on Kaufmann Phase One the following day to bring things back to normal. I\u2019m pretty sensitive to junk food these days. I feel swollen the next day if I have an indulgence meal. Getting back to Kaufmann Dieting is always the trick for me, along with fish oil, curcumin, ginger, and other anti-inflammatory antifungals . \n4 ). Speaking of antifungals , you may notice some sniffles and coughing after an evening of indulgence. This is why I always have powerful natural Antifungals on hand, such as the ones listed above, along with oregano oil, olive leaf extract, garlic, caprylic acid, berberine, and others. It just makes sense to have these at the ready, both for some weekly rotation as well as for dealing with anything that creeps up during the holiday season. \nIN SUMMARY\u2026 Don\u2019t use fear. Enjoy a little. Look for alternatives to traditional candies, if possible.

No one could argue that eating more vegetables and fruits is a bad thing for the majority of people. \nThe term \"plant-based\" is somewhat nebulous. Some people use it to describe a diet that consists of mostly plants, but still contains meat, eggs, and dairy products. Some use the term to describe a vegetarian lifestyle, which allows for some dairy and eggs, but no animal flesh of any kind. And some use it to describe a diet free from any animal products at all, which is referred to as \"vegan\". \nThere are a variety of reasons why one would want to adopt a plant-based lifestyle. Research certainly shows some health benefits associated with this type of lifestyle, including reduced cancer risk and reduced risk of heart disease. Furthermore, one can lessen their environmental impact in eating this way. \nThe question for some is, can you eat a plant-based diet while on the Kaufmann Anti-fungal diet. The answer is, yes! \nThe Kaufmann Diet is fairly adaptable when it comes to vegan and vegetarian lifestyles. However, there are some things to remember if you are eating a plant-based diet while on the Kaufmann Anti-fungal program. \nMany Popular Vegan and Vegetarian Foods Should Be Avoided \nA number of foods popular with vegans and vegetarians should likely be avoided while on the Kaufmann diet , such as soy and soy products (i.e., tofu, tempeh, etc.), peanuts and peanut butter, corn, wheat and foods like seitan (wheat protein) and yeast. \n\n  Diet   \nThe issue with these foods is that research indicates that they are commonly contaminated with mold toxins that are linked to a variety of health problems. When you eat these foods, you are putting yourself at risk for exposure to these toxins, known as mycotoxins. \nIf you are not careful, you are at risk for nutritional deficiencies. \nGetting enough protein in your diet is easy if you regularly consume meat or eggs. Vegans and vegetarians certainly need to be aware of the amount of protein they get in their diet. \nProtein, however, is not the only concerning nutrient. Certain nutrients like vitamin B12, vitamin D3, and omega 3 DHA. Certain amino acids, such as creatine, carnosine, and nutrients like heme-iron are also absent from vegan diets and lower in vegetarians. \nThese nutrients, of course, can be supplemented with; however, the bioavailability of those nutrients can be an issue when relying on supplements. \nIn short, is certainly possible to adapt a plant-based lifestyle on the Kaufmann Diet, but extra attention must be paid to ensure one is getting all of the nutrients necessary to sustain vibrant health while avoiding potentially contaminated foods.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kaufmann", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaufmann diet", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-27T23:14:14.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be35119f8e5b655c8e2398e2d44c802852ad6bec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.WA6QAdxS7zOlN_S0A66kwYQZGy3.RocRS_WLyd1LQNryGT7iav2qZcWS6DwCqaxf7DWK2TSqVjEmwm_150oAb8hmrmQh06YU3ACcw.4QFtgyRAuGgtT8u4wL5jSeRJUqmRvXH1AgNqS685vhZRR.BGLRe6WDNZTYw-", "site_full": "knowthecause.com", "site": "knowthecause.com", "site_section": "http://knowthecause.com/index.php?format=feed&type=atom", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Home", "title": "Crohn's and Colitis Summit - Joel Sprechman Interview", "title_full": "Crohn's and Colitis Summit - Joel Sprechman Interview", "published": "2017-10-30T21:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://knowthecause.com/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be35119f8e5b655c8e2398e2d44c802852ad6bec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.WA6QAdxS7zOlN_S0A66kwYQZGy3.RocRS_WLyd1LQNryGT7iav2qZcWS6DwCqaxf7DWK2TSqVjEmwm_150oAb8hmrmQh06YU3ACcw.4QFtgyRAuGgtT8u4wL5jSeRJUqmRvXH1AgNqS685vhZRR.BGLRe6WDNZTYw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Know The Cause (social@knowthecause.com)", "published": "2017-10-30T21:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Crohn's and Colitis Summit - Joel Sprechman Interview", "text": "The Fungus Link Vol 1 \nBoth Doug Kaufmann and David Holland, MD discuss topics such as chronic fatigue syndrome, arthritis, intestinal disorders, allergies, respiratory illness, \u201cbrain fog\u201d syndrome, depression, and chronic skin conditions.

You and I don't need [to live] in a soundproofed zen meditation garden. We need a way to work even when we're distracted because the world will always be distracting.\" -Ramit Sethi, entrepreneur This will feel more controversial than it should. \nYour health lifestyle needs to work in the real world. Certainly, we get to determine much of what our \"real world\" looks like. It may not contain vaccines or GMO foods. It may be early mornings at the gym. Your lifestyle may end up looking a lot different than your friends\u2019 and family\u2019s lifestyles. And part of why we have the Know The Cause community is to connect and share so you know how to make this lifestyle work in the real world. \nHaving said that, there are things we can't control, and challenges we just have to be able to withstand. \nSleep It Off For example, sleep. My Aunt Wilma used to have little sayings and proverbs and pieces of folk wisdom she'd share with the kids around her. I was at her house one day when I was a child, and out of nowhere she looked at me and said, \"Kyle, you need to train yourself to be able to sleep anywhere - a car, a bus, on the ground...anywhere.\" And then she went back to whatever she was doing. \n(She, like all of my mom's family, grew up during the Great Depression, and a lot of their advice was about becoming hearty and adaptable.) \nFast-forward to this year when I was listening to a \"biohacker\" podcast, and the subject was sleep. The host and guest were talking about all of the gear they both \"need\" in order to get a decent night's sleep. The curtains, masks, humidity, EMF disrupters, ambient noise, ear plugs, mattress covers, pillow add-ons, magnetized box springs, binaural wave generators, hours of lead-up, etc are all, apparently, how they \"hack\" their sleep. They each said something like, \"If I don't have ALL of these variables accounted for, I'm a mess.\" \nAunt Wilma would not be impressed. \nOne of them recognized how much handling they need for just a simple night\u2019s sleep, and he asked, \u201cIn a way\u2026do you think we\u2019re weakening ourselves by requiring so much sleep tech?\u201d Long pause. \u201cUhhmmm\u2026I don\u2019t really want to answer that question\u201d, the other one replied. \nI've noticed that a lot of current bio-hacking philosophy surrounds various kinds of tech that supposedly make your health optimization easier. And some of it is really cool. I wear a mask at night to block out any ambient light, but it\u2019s not the kind the biohackers recommend for $400; mine came from Wal Mart for three bucks. \nBut I understand cool tech. I love all of it. And yet, there's something about NEEDING all of this stuff that bothers me. \n\nThis is the newest recipe book for the Kaufmann diet and includes more healthy recipes along with helpful hints on cooking and dietary changes. \nBecoming Soft Michael Smith, who is a terrific contributor to Know The Cause, was talking with me a decade ago about this kind of thing, and simply said, \"It feels like instead of these things making us stronger and heartier, our dependence on them is making us softer.\" Every time either of us talks about how we're struggling with something that shouldn't be a struggle, the other one will say, \"Soft\". \nWe also remind ourselves of Doug Kaufmann's sharing his stories of his year in Vietnam as a Navy Corpsman. Bullets, snakes, leeches, rain, mosquitos and malaria, explosions are only a few things he and all of our military personnel have had to deal with. You can't exactly control the humidity in the jungle. But you gotta sleep. \nWe shouldn't compare wartime challenges with regular civilian life and simple ways to optimize our lives. I'm just saying that luxurious \"hack\" strategies, perhaps, shouldn't be what our health depends on. \nOut To Eat Don't hate me, but the same is true of restaurant experiences. I go out with supplement company reps a lot after my radio show. If there's no overtly healthy restaurant nearby and we go to a conventional food restaurant instead, and we should know what we're walking into. But my goodness....the grief that natural health people put wait staff through is sometimes ridiculous. \nI was once sitting with a newly minted naturopath who was grilling our waitress relentlessly: \"Are the greens organic? Why don't you have stevia or xylitol at the table? Is the cream from grass-fed cows?\" \nIt went on and on throughout the whole meal. And she harangued me with it, too! \"What brand of stevia is that? Don't you know that you should put these special power drops in municipal water? You should bring polycarbonate utensils with you to restaurants.\" (This, while she ate breadsticks and low-fat pasta.) \nI finally said, \"We knew what we were walking into when we came here. It's a conventional restaurant, and it's just one meal.\" \nWhen I said that, her shoulders dropped, she put her head in her hands, then looked up and said, \"I'm sorry. I don't usually behave this way. I just thought you were going to be uptight about everything because you've been in natural health for so long. I was just trying to get along.\" We had a long talk about natural health culture afterward. (And yes, our waitress was given an apology and an extra tip for enduring all of that with grace.) \nOthers I've eaten with told me that they'll \"probably get migraines\" after we ate conventional eggs from a restaurant. \nOne person told me that they were going to need chelation therapy because we ate grilled chicken at a restaurant, and he worried that the chicken had heavy metals in it. \nOne woman was in tears after swallowing a sample capsule of a supplement and discovering that it contained a whisper of magnesium stearate. She literally thought her life was at risk because of the scare articles she read online about this filler. She called me for days afterward, worried that something horrible was about to happen to her. The Real World, Such As It Is \nOur debate culture may have taught you to challenge me by accusing me of secretly being in favor of GMOs, or conventional food, etc. I'm not in favor of any of that - and I'm not suggesting you shouldn't have strategies that optimize your life and health. 90% of the time, you'd be proud of me. \nOn the other hand, we have to live in the real world. Occasionally, the beef in front of us will be grass-fed but not grass-finished. Sometimes, you have to sleep in a hotel room without blackout curtains over the windows. Once in a while, your health tracker won't be available, and you'll have to hit the gym without knowing your heart rate or the number of steps you've taken that day. And that's OK. \nNatural health culture rightly exposes toxins and harmful habits that our culture tends to know nothing about. It attempts to empower you to avoid what you can, and seek out things that make your life better. \nBut sometimes you just can't be ideal. Please try not to worry about it. I always tell my clients to begin with a picture of what Ideal probably looks like, and then get as close to that as your time, finances, and lifestyle will allow. And don't sweat it when you either mess up occasionally or just couldn't manage to be Ideal once this week. \nAnd learn to sleep anywhere.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kaufmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramit sethi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug kaufmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aunt wilma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wal mart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navy corpsman", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vietnam", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-01T07:24:37.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "17fc6ebd220c0c29df600b7aa2b5d777fff7f7c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8PTN9ARGnSeNY3eYI5Fq.Fd0n5CgN6up.niMZc9Ac5zhZbyJZnX5K_kkdTnAddjRHxhjMTOzZffFk0VGLA3NhoeZ4I7T4Hi5DIKVutJCDjTXbGP7RPXFBfTKGl5ghPd_oVHAkc0QLpdON7m1..BDWG", "site_full": "www.knowthecause.com", "site": "knowthecause.com", "site_section": "http://www.knowthecause.com/index.php?format=feed&type=rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Home", "title": "Is Natural Health Culture Making You Weaker??", "title_full": "Is Natural Health Culture Making You Weaker??", "published": "2017-11-01T12:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.knowthecause.com/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "17fc6ebd220c0c29df600b7aa2b5d777fff7f7c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8PTN9ARGnSeNY3eYI5Fq.Fd0n5CgN6up.niMZc9Ac5zhZbyJZnX5K_kkdTnAddjRHxhjMTOzZffFk0VGLA3NhoeZ4I7T4Hi5DIKVutJCDjTXbGP7RPXFBfTKGl5ghPd_oVHAkc0QLpdON7m1..BDWG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kyle_drew@hotmail.com (Kyle Drew)", "published": "2017-11-01T12:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Is Natural Health Culture Making You Weaker??", "text": "| Print | \n\"Part of being a top performer is existing in the real world.
