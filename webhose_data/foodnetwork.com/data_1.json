It\u2019s currently available in several shops around the U.S. as well as online. Molinari says he hopes, in time, to expand into Canada and overseas. \nTo make Molinari Private Reserve, coffee beans are soaked in a \u201cspecial house made red\u201d wine \u2013 \u201cabsorbing the wine\u2019s nose and history\u201d \u2013 and then dried and small-batch roasted by hand. This process produces a \u201crich\u201d and \u201cfull-bodied\u201d flavor with a \u201cblueberry note\u201d that is actually, in the end, alcohol free, according to the Molinari Private Reserve website , where a half-pound bag of beans can be ordered for $19.95. \nPreparation in a French Press or drip brew is recommended, as is the addition of milk to bring \u201cthe wine taste out first, then the balance of coffee second.\u201d \nRefrigerating leftovers for cold consumption is also suggested. \u201cMuch like wine, the cooler MPR gets, the more the coffee breathes and opens,\u201d according to the site. \nOriginally available in caffeinated form only, MPR is now available in decaf as well. Molinari says he prefers the latter \u201cbecause the decaffeinated bean is drier so it soaks up more of the liquid.\u201d \nAlso in the works: Molinari has been making bon-bons, chocolate, ice cream and rubs out of the wine-infused coffee beans. \nWine-infused coffee chocolate? Let\u2019s all just take a moment to absorb the nose and history of that concept.

Photo by: Tara Donne Tara Donne \nIt\u2019s October and that means pumpkin beer is on the menu. We asked experts from breweries around the country for their dish recommendations when it comes to dining with this seasonal brew. The options are diverse, so there\u2019s sure to be something for everyone. Next time you pick up a pumpkin-flavored six pack, add ingredients for these recipes to your cart, too. \nPecan Pie \nThis Thanksgiving classic brings out the nutty flavors in pumpkin beer, according to Devon Poulos, executive chef at Growler USA. \u201cPlus, it has a crunchy element and you could even incorporate pumpkin beer into the filling,\u201d she says. Try Ree Drummond\u2019s five-star recipe if you\u2019re not sure where to start. \nStuffed Mushrooms \nRogue brewmaster John Maier pairs his favorite pumpkin ale with savory stuffed mushrooms. \u201cNothing says fall in Oregon like mushrooms, especially when stuffed with blue cheese and a little sage to brighten it up,\u201d he says. Giada De Laurentiis\u2019s stuffed mushrooms are grilled with gorgonzola and sausage. \nChocolate Cheesecake \nScott Vaccaro, founder of Captain Lawrence Brewing Co., loves to pair pumpkin beers with chocolate cheesecake. \u201cI think that the spices and the chocolate go great together,\u201d he says, since the flavors in most pumpkin beer are based on pumpkin pie spice, not actual pumpkin. This Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake is the ultimate dessert for chocolate (and now pumpkin beer!) lovers. \nChicken and Waffles \nDevin O\u2019Brien, freak chief and certified cicerone of Coney Island Brewing Co., goes with chicken and waffles when he wants to pair pumpkin beer with something unexpected. \u201cThe pumpkin and caramel-like sweetness in our beer would complement the waffles really nicely, and cut through some of the greasy richness of fried chicken.\u201d This recipe from Food Network Kitchen is a classic.

We love Bobby Flay\u2019s recipe. \nCurried Carrot Soup \nSpicy curry contrasts the sweet flavors in pumpkin ale. \u201cThe spices balance each other without creating a spice overload,\u201d says Al Marzi, Harpoon Brewery\u2019s chief brewing officer. Rachael Ray\u2019s recipe for soup is ready in less than 30 minutes. Photo by: Tara Donne \u00a9FOOD NETWORK : 2012, Television Food Network, G.P. Tara Donne, FOOD NETWORK : 2012, Television Food Network, G.P. \nApple Pie \n\u201cAnything that mom makes in the fall would pair well with pumpkin beer,\u201d says Patrick Carroll, executive chef at Three Notch'd Craft Kitchen and Brewery. For sweeter beers, he recommends a classic apple pie. This recipe from Food Network Kitchens is a fan-favorite with more than 100 reviews and 4.5 stars. \nMole Negro \nBrad Cooper, founder of Steam Bell Beer Works draws inspiration from where pumpkins originally come from: Mexico, which is why he pairs pumpkin beer with Mexican cooking. \u201cMole negro is traditionally prepared with spices such as cinnamon and clove that are also found in many pumpkin beers,\u201d he says.

Those who have difficulty drinking traditional cow\u2019s milk are usually pushed to lactose-free or nut and soy based varieties. But what if there was another option? If you have trouble digesting milk \u2014 even if you think it\u2019s related to lactose intolerance \u2014 A2 milk could be the answer. \nCasein is the largest group of proteins in cow\u2019s milk, making up about 80% of the total protein content. The two most common forms of casein being A1 and A2; the type found in milk is directly related to the breed of cow it came from. Most milk contains both A1 and A2 casein but a new brand of milk comes only from A2 producing cows. \nIn comparison studies, A2 milk is more easily digested than milking containing A1 protein, even in those who previously thought they were lactose intolerant. When we breakdown A1 casein during digestion, a protein fragment BCM-7 (beta-casomorphin-7) is produced, which can trigger symptoms such as bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation and other gastrointestinal issues. BCM-7 is not produced during the breakdown of A2 proteins. \nThe hypothesis is that consumption of A1 casein leads to the production of BCM-7, which can cause a range of pro-inflammatory effects that aren\u2019t seen in the consumption of A2 only milk. Surprisingly, the ability to enjoy A2 milk without any side effects were seen in both lactose tolerant and lactose intolerant participants. This suggests that some of the symptoms we normally attribute to lactose intolerance may actually relate to the production of BCM-7 instead. \nSimilar in price to lactose-free milk, A2 milk provides a cows-milk alternative with no difference in taste to those who have a hard time digesting milk but haven\u2019t been clinically confirmed with a lactose intolerance. If you don\u2019t have any issues with regular cow\u2019s milk, then you don\u2019t need to switch to A2. However, if you if have difficulty with dairy and are missing it in your diet, A2 milk might provide the perfect solution.
