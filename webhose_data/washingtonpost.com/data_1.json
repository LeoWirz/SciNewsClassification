Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat who is running for governor, was joined at the vigil for the victims of the Las Vegas shootings by Attorney General Mark Herring (D), whose support for gun control has drawn a barrage of NRA ads for his re-election bid, and U.S. Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), as well as several Democratic state lawmakers. \nThey made pleas for gun control -- and one delivered a forceful condemnation of the Republican response, particularly from GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie who said Monday it was too soon after the Sunday shootings that killed 59 people to discuss ways to reduce gun violence. Instead, Gillespie said he was praying for the dead and for more than 500 others who were injured. \n\u201cToday they are talking about thoughts and prayer because that\u2019s all they have,\u201d said Del. Mark Levine (D-Alexandria). \u201cEd Gillespie has been silent on this issue for decades, and that silence is killing us.\u201d [ How the Virginia candidates for governor responded to the Las Vegas shootings ] \nNortham is running neck and neck with Gillespie in the nation\u2019s marquee statewide election this year. \nSeveral parents of victims of the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre spoke at the vigial, giving emotional remarks between long, tearful pauses. \nNortham, a pediatric. neurologist, shared stories he has frequently told on the campaign trail about treating children who had accidentally been shot and, his voice breaking, he spoke of a woman he had cared for as a toddler who was killed by her husband. \n\u201cUntil I do not have any more breath in my lungs, I will stand up and tell people that we do not need assault weapons on our streets,\u201d said Northam. \u201cI will continue to stand up, I will continue to fight, I will continue to be proud of my F grade with the NRA.\u201d View Graphic The latest stories and details on the 2017 Virginia general election and race for governor. \nThe NRA, which has endorsed Gillespie and awarded him an A rating, plans to run political advertising worth more than $750,000 between Oct. 10 and the Nov. 7 election.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends the weekly cabinet meeting at his office in Jerusalem, Sunday, Oct. 1, 2017. (Sebastian Scheiner/Associated Press) By Associated Press By Associated Press October 3 at 6:54 AM \nMAALE ADUMIM, West Bank \u2014 Israel\u2019s prime minister has pledged to build thousands of new housing units in the West Bank\u2019s biggest Jewish settlement and annex it to Israel. \nBenjamin Netanyahu spoke during a visit on Tuesday to Maale Adumim, where he promised \u201cenhanced development\u201d of the settlement. \nNetanyahu gave no specifics or a timetable, which suggests he may have been playing to his nationalistic base. \nIsrael captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 war and has since built dozens of settlements there. \nThe Palestinians, along with much of the international community, view the settlements as illegal and an obstacle to peace.

Then the gunshots started.]\nAs he fired round after round during an 11-minute stretch from a suite on the 32nd floor of Casino, Paddock used video cameras to keep an eye out for police storming his hotel room, according to Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo.\nPaddock hid one camera in the peephole of his suite and two more in the hall, at least one of them disguised on a service cart, authorities said. At one point, he shot numerous rounds through the door, wounding a security guard. Paddock eventually put a gun in his own mouth and pulled the trigger as SWAT officers closed in. They found him with blood pooling behind his head and around the empty shell casings that littered the carpet, a handgun near his body.\n\u201cIt was preplanned, extensively, and I\u2019m pretty sure that he evaluated everything that he did in his actions, which is troublesome,\u201d Lombardo said.\nThe sheriff said investigators were \u201cmaking progress\u201d on determining a motive, but complete answers remained elusive. There were precious few clues in Paddock\u2019s background.\nAn investigator works in the room at Casino on Tuesday, in Las Vegas. A gunman opened fire from the room, killing at least 58 people and injuring hundreds. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Neighbors in several states where Paddock owned homes in retirement communities describe him as surly, unfriendly and standoffish. Paddock was the son of a bank robber who was once on the FBI\u2019s most-wanted list and who authorities described at the time as a \u201cpsychopath,\u201d but Paddock\u2019s brother said their father was not involved in their lives when they were children.\nRelatives say the roots of Paddock\u2019s loner lifestyle might have been planted on July 28, 1960. On that day, when Paddock was 7, a neighbor from across the street took him swimming. The neighbor told a local newspaper at the time that she knew authorities were coming for his father, and she wanted to spare the young boy from the trauma of seeing his father taken away. From that point on, Paddock\u2019s family was never the same.\nUntil carrying out the massacre Sunday night, Paddock had no criminal history himself. Despite repeated claims by the Islamic State to the contrary, he also had no ties to international terror groups, authorities said. He had done some government work during his career, as a letter carrier for the Postal Service, an agent for the Internal Revenue Service and an auditor for the federal government\u2019s Defense Contract Audit Agency in the late 1970s and 1980s. He was divorced twice and recently had been dating a woman from the Philippines who has Australian citizenship. He was known to gamble routinely and extensively.\nSome public officials seemed to suggest Paddock\u2019s mind was troubled, though there were no immediate indications that he had been diagnosed with a mental illness or was anything other than fully aware of what he was doing.\n\u201cA normal person would not cause this type of harm to innocent people,\u201d said Rep. Ruben Kihuen (D-Nev.). \u201cClearly, there was something wrong with this man.\u201d\nPeople close to the investigation also said that in the weeks before the attack, Paddock transferred a large amount of money \u2014 close to $100,000 \u2014 to someone in the Philippines, possibly his girlfriend. The significance of that development was not immediately clear, though investigators said they were interested in probing Paddock\u2019s finances and his avid interest in high-stakes gambling.\nThe girlfriend, Marilou Danley, returned to the United States from the Philippines Tuesday night and was met at Los Angeles International Airport by FBI agents, according to wire reports. Investigators considered her a \u201cperson of interest,\u201d Lombardo said. Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) said that police are eager to talk to her, as Paddock \u201cdoesn\u2019t meet any profiles\u201d and the \u201cbest lead is through this girlfriend.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know a lot about who the girlfriend is and why she left the country a week prior to the shooting,\u201d said Heller, who has been briefed by authorities. \u201cShe is someone they need to have this discussion with to better understand the shooting and what his thought process was.\u201d\nDouglas and Sylvia Vick from Texas pray at a makeshift memorial on the Las Vegas Strip on Tuesday. (Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images) At his home in Orlando, Eric Paddock, Stephen Paddock\u2019s brother, said he doubts Danley had any prior knowledge of the incident and speculated that Stephen might have been trying to quietly ensure her financial stability. Stephen Paddock loved and doted on his girlfriend, whom he had met when she was a hostess at a casino, Eric Paddock said. The couple often gambled side by side.\n\u201cHe manipulated her to be as far away from here and safe when he committed this,\u201d Eric Paddock said. \u201cThe people he loved he took care of, and as he was descending into hell he took care of her.\u201d\nThe shooting \u2014 which left 59 people dead and injured more than 500 others \u2014 reignited the debate on Capitol Hill and across the country about whether lawmakers should impose new restrictions on firearms. Clark County Coroner John Fudenberg on Tuesday evening clarified that Paddock was among the 59 slain in the incident; previously, authorities had said he wasn\u2019t.\nUndersheriff Kevin C. McMahill, speaking after Fudenberg, warned that the number of dead and injured could fluctuate as the investigation progresses.\n\u201cThe answer that the coroner provided you is the most recent, relevant number that we have,\u201d McMahill said.\nCaution tape lines the doors of the gunman\u2019s suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. (Bild Exclusive/Polaris.) Several Democrats used the massacre to push for new restrictions, and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) asserted Tuesday that Republican leaders have no plans to advance a bill, which passed a House committee last month, that would make it easier to buy gun silencers.\nLeaving the White House to visit hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico on Tuesday morning, President Trump said that \u201cwe\u2019ll be talking about gun laws as time goes by.\u201d\nPaddock brought 23 guns to his Mandalay Bay suite, which overlooked the concert grounds on the southern end of the Strip. Included in that cache was an AR-15-type rifle with a high-capacity magazine and 12 \u201cbump stocks,\u201d a modification that would allow a gun to fire as if it were an automatic weapon. He also brought another AR-15-type rifle with a magnification scope commonly used for hunting and a bipod stand to help steady it, according to law enforcement officials and experts who reviewed images of the weapons posted online.\n\u201cFor this individual to take it upon himself to create this chaos and harm is unspeakable,\u201d Lombardo said.\n[The lives lost in the Las Vegas massacre]\nThe guns appeared to be but a piece of the arsenal Paddock had acquired during a period of years, at least some of it legally obtained from major retailers such as Cabela\u2019s, national retailer of guns and outdoor gear, and Guns & Guitars, a store in Mesquite, Nev., according to people familiar with the case. ATF Special Agent in Charge Jill A. Snyder said Tuesday Paddock had purchased shotguns, handguns and rifles in Nevada, Utah, California and Texas.\nAt Paddock\u2019s home in Mesquite, Nev., investigators recovered 19 more guns and an explosive, and in his car, they found ammonium nitrate, a chemical that can be used in bomb making. At another property in Reno, Nev., investigators recovered five more handguns, two shotguns and a \u201cplethora\u201d of ammunition, Lombardo said Tuesday.\nPaddock probably secreted the weapons to his Mandalay Bay suite using more than 10 suitcases he brought with him. Lombardo said hotel housekeeping had been there since Paddock checked in on Sept. 28 and spotted nothing nefarious.\nLombardo said investigators had scoured Paddock\u2019s suite, his car and the homes in Nevada, and they were examining surveillance and body camera video evidence and other electronic items they had seized in their searches. Separately, Lombardo said the department had opened an investigation into the unauthorized release of images that show the crime scene. Another sheriff\u2019s official confirmed the authenticity of those images.\nPolice also continued documenting the crime scene and performing the grim task of identifying those slain, some of whom died blocks away from the concert as they tried to flee or seek help. As of late Tuesday afternoon, authorities had tentatively identified all of the victims.\n[How the shooting unfolded]\nSince the shooting, horrific stories have emerged of lives cut short, some taking bullets as they sought to protect their loved ones.\nBobby and Jenny Parks, a married couple from California who had been high school sweethearts, were swaying to a love song when a bullet struck her. He held her as she died.\nAfter Cameron Robinson, a 27-year-old from Utah, was shot in the neck, his boyfriend, Robert Eardley, carried him to a vehicle. Robinson died before they made it to a hospital.\nTwo people who met at the festival \u2014 Kody Robertson and Michelle Vo \u2014 were watching the final act together when a bullet struck her chest. Robertson threw his body over hers to protect her. Later, they were separated; he tracked her down to a hospital and was told late Monday morning that she was dead.\nPaddock\u2019s weaponry would have allowed him to fire both rapidly and precisely at the crowd that was several hundred yards away and below him. The shots \u2014 fired from two windows of Mandalay Bay\u2019s golden facade, which Paddock had smashed out \u2014 sent thousands of people scrambling for safety under Vegas\u2019s neon glow. Police on Tuesday showed body camera footage of officers scrambling to determine where the shots came from as they yelled for people to leave the area.\n\u201cThey\u2019re shooting right at us, guys,\u201d an officer can be heard saying. \u201cStay down! Stay down!\u201d\nHospitals across the region continued to treat patients from the scene, many of them seriously injured. Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center says as of Tuesday night, 59 patients remain in the hospital and 31 of them are still in critical condition. University Medical Center said it had 64 patients from the attack, 12 of them critical.\nRoads inside the Mandalay Bay Resort are closed for investigation on Tuesday in Las Vegas.

The European Union insisted Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2017, that Brexit negotiations with Britain will not move onto future relations until enough progress on such things as London\u2019s exit payment has been made. (Jean-Francois Badias, File/Associated Press) By Raf Casert and Lorne Cook\u2009|\u2009AP By Raf Casert and Lorne Cook\u2009|\u2009AP October 3 at 12:59 PM \nBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union insisted Tuesday that Brexit negotiations with Britain will not move on to the question of future relations until enough progress has been made on divorce issues, such as how much Britain\u2019s exit bill should be. \nBritain desperately wants talks to move on to future trade and security arrangements but EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that more needs to be done on the withdrawal issues first. \nJuncker told the European Parliament that \u201cwe have not made the sufficient progress needed\u201d and the EU legislators backed him, approving a resolution underscoring the same point with a vote of 557 to 92 with 29 abstentions. It further underscored the unity of the 27 EU nations as they face off with Britain in the talks. \nThe EU wants London to commit to guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens already in Britain and make that sure border posts do not reappear between Northern Ireland \u2014 which is part of the U.K. \u2014 and Ireland, which is part of the EU. It also wants Britain to pay up for everything it had agreed to while it was a member. \nJuncker said \u201cthe taxpayers in the EU 27 should not pay for the British decision\u201d to leave, while the bloc\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said \u201cserious differences remain\u201d on how many bills the U.K. still has to settle. \nEstimates vary widely on the amount Britain will be expected to pay, from 20 billion euros ($27 billion) to over three times that amount. \n\u201cSerious rifts remain, especially on the financial settlement,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cWe will not pay at 27 what has been decided at 28, it is simple as that.\u201d \nThe parliamentary resolution called for postponing any move to widen the talks with Britain unless \u201ca major breakthrough\u201d takes place during the fifth round of negotiations in Brussels next week. \nObservers said decisive progress was highly unlikely. \nTuesday\u2019s moves further dampened hopes that the EU leaders might give the green light to an expansion in the talks at a summit on Oct 19-20. \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May downplayed the EU vote, saying it was \u201cnot unexpected\u201d and adding that she believed EU leaders were beginning to consider Britain\u2019s ideas. \nU.K. Brexit Secretary David Davis said talks were making good progress, dismissing what he called \u201clurid accounts\u201d in the media of crisis and breakdown. But he also said Britain had \u201ccontingency arrangements\u201d in case the negotiations broke down without a deal. \nMany European lawmakers were dismissive of May\u2019s Conservative government, which is widely seen as insecure and bumbling. The head of the biggest party group in the European Parliament called for the sacking of British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson for stoking confusion over the Brexit talks. \nThe European People\u2019s Party chairman, Manfred Weber, appealed to May: \u201cPlease sack Johnson, because we need a clear answer who is responsible for the British position.\u201d \nWeber turned Henry Kissinger\u2019s famous observation about the many leaders in the EU onto Britain. \n\u201cWho shall I call in London? Who speaks for the government?

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is at left. (Pavel Golovkin, Pool/Associated Press) By Nataliya Vasilyeva\u2009|\u2009AP By Nataliya Vasilyeva\u2009|\u2009AP October 3 at 7:45 AM \nMOSCOW \u2014 The new U.S. ambassador to Russia presented his diplomatic credentials to President Vladimir Putin at a ceremony Tuesday in the Kremlin, a move that marks the formal start of Jon Huntsman\u2019s work in Russia. \nHuntsman, who has twice served as a U.S. ambassador, arrived in Moscow on Sunday to take over from John Tefft, who left after serving in Russia for three years, a period that was marred by a deep and rapid deterioration of ties, unseen since the end of the Cold War. The U.S.-Russia relationship has soured even further in recent months following a series of expulsions of diplomats and closures of diplomatic missions. \nIn his address to Huntsman, Putin offered Russia\u2019s condolences over Monday\u2019s deadly shooting attack in Las Vegas and expressed hope for better ties with the U.S. \n\u201cThe current level of the ties cannot satisfy us,\u201d Putin said. \u201cWe stand for constructive, predictable and mutually beneficial cooperation.\u201d \nPutin also said both the U.S. and Russia should not meddle in each other\u2019s \u201cdomestic affairs.\u201d \nHuntsman, the former Utah governor who once called for Donald Trump to drop out of the presidential race, won easy confirmation as U.S. ambassador last week. He was the nation\u2019s top diplomat to Singapore under President George H.W. Bush and ambassador to China under President Barack Obama before returning to the U.S. to run for president in 2012. \nHuntsman had an up-and-down relationship with Trump during last year\u2019s campaign. The former governor was slow to endorse any candidate for the Republican nomination, though he did back Trump once he became the presumptive nominee. But Huntsman then called for Trump to drop out of the presidential race after the release of a 2005 audio in which Trump was captured on a microphone making lewd comments about women. \nAlthough Trump has called Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election a hoax pushed by Democrats to sully his victory at the polls, Huntsman said at his confirmation hearing last week that \u201cthere is no question, underline, no question\u201d that Moscow interfered. He also said he would not hesitate to remind Russian officials that they are accountable for their actions. \nHuntsman comes into office with a drastically reduced staff after the Russian Foreign Ministry ordered the U.S. to cut its embassy and consulate staff in Russia by 755 people, or by two-thirds, heightening tensions between Washington and Moscow after U.S. Congress approved sanctions against Russia. \nIn response, the U.S. suspended issuing nonimmigrant visas in Moscow for a week in August and stopped issuing visas at its consulates elsewhere in Russia. \nRelations between Russia and the United States cooled following Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, where fighting since 2014 has left 10,000 people dead. Reports of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election put a further damper on hopes for better ties that the Kremlin had pinned on Trump\u2019s presidency. \nIn August, the U.S. adopted a new package of stiff financial sanctions against Russia, aimed at punishing Moscow for interfering in the U.S. election and for its military aggression in Ukraine and Syria, where the Kremlin has backed President Bashar Assad. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Got it By Associated Press By Associated Press October 3 at 6:53 AM \nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 A Jewish rights group is urging a Polish state historical institute to fire an official who has published several books by notorious British Holocaust denier David Irving. \nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center, headquartered in the United States, says the official, Arkadiusz Wingert, published books by Irving between 2009 and 2014. \nWingert is now the deputy director of the publishing office of the Institute of National Remembrance, a state body that investigates crimes in Poland during World War II and the subsequent communist era. \n\u201cIf the (institute) is to maintain any shred of credibility it must end its relationship with Wingert immediately and stop all efforts aimed at undermining the history of the Holocaust in Poland,\u201d Mark Weitzman, director of government affairs for the Wiesenthal center, said in a statement late Monday. \nThe history institute has defended hiring Wingert, arguing that none of the works that Wingert published violated Polish law, which makes Holocaust denial a crime. \nIt also noted that the Polish editions of Irving\u2019s works Wingert had already been published elsewhere first. \nIrving is a revisionist historian who has declared that the Auschwitz gas chambers were a hoax. \nHe has been declared guilty of Holocaust denial by courts in Britain and Austria, where he served a 13-month prison sentence. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Many people have bought surgical masks and other supplies at pharmacies, raising concerns about a shortage of medicine. \nThe World Health Organization says at least 114 people have been infected and that, unlike past plague outbreaks in Madagascar, the current one is affecting large urban areas.

(AP Photo/Philip Kamrass, File) \nLarge-scale, high-profile shootings such as the horrific one that just happened in Las Vegas represent just a tiny fraction of the daily drumbeat of gun violence in the United States. This year close to 12,000 people have been killed in gun violence incidents, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit organization that tracks shootings via media and police reports. \nThat works out to around 42 victims of gun violence per day, a figure which does not include suicides. \nSunday alone there were at least 24 fatal shooting incidents in the United States, including the Las Vegas shooting, according to the Gun Violence Archive. That number doesn't include suicides, and it doesn't include shootings in which individuals were injured but not killed. It does include fatal shootings involving police officers, which are often determined to be justified after the fact. The shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas on Oct. 1 is being called the deadliest mass shooting in recent American history. Here is a look at other shooting sprees that killed dozens in the U.S. (Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post) \nIt's understandable that we focus on the major mass shooting events \u2014 the sheer scale of the horror is overwhelming. But day by day, week by week, the run-of-the-mill homicides that barely draw any attention account for the overwhelming share of American gun tragedies. \nTo get some sense of the scale of the violence, I've listed and described each of Sunday's fatal shooting incidents, as tallied by the Gun Violence Archive, below. \nWeber City, Va . : Todd Allen Richardson, 44, fatally shot his estranged wife after inviting her to his house to collect her belongings. He subsequently led police on a high-speed car chase, taking his own life at the end of it. \nMilwaukee : Stanley Smith, 56, a father and grandfather, was killed by unknown assailants outside his home in the early hours of the morning. \nAvondale, Ariz. : A man was fatally shot and a woman was wounded after an altercation between two groups of people in a parking lot. \nLas Vegas : A person was shot and killed in a room of The Suites hotel in the early- morning hours. \nRochester, N.Y. : Shaquan McMillan, 23, was fatally shot in the chest outside of Abbott's Frozen Custard in the early-morning hours. \nLas Vegas : At least 59 people were killed and more than 500 injured after a gunman opened fire on a crowd of people attending a country music concert. \nMiami : A man was shot and killed by police in the early morning hours after gunshots were reported outside Heads or Tails Gentleman's Lounge. \nLawrence, Kan. : Three people were killed and two more wounded following an altercation downtown in the early-morning hours. The dead included 22-year-old Leah Elizabeth Brown, 20-year-old Colwin Lynn Henderson, and 24-year-old Tremel Dupree Dean. \nChicago : About 10:30 in the morning, a 28-year-old man was killed and a woman with him was injured after another man walked up to them and opened fire. \nKent, Wash. : Three men in their 20s were shot, one fatally, near a strip mall. \nIndianapolis : A teenager was fatally shot about 4 a.m. after a family member mistook him for an intruder in the home. \nChester, Pa.: About 9:30 a.m., a man was found fatally shot in a home in Chester. \nTulsa : As a family prepared to leave their home, they were confronted by a lone person carrying a gun. The person fatally shot the father and fled on foot. \nDistrict Heights, Md .: A man in his 50s was found fatally shot in a home. \nNorcorss, Ga .: Domiquo Riley, 19, was fatally shot outside a club in the early hours of the morning. \nHouston : A cabdriver was shot to death outside a gas station in the early hours of the morning. \nFort Collins, Colo. : Police shot and killed an armed man at the Best Value Inn after responding to reports of shots fired. \nBurlington, Iowa .: Marquise Jones, 27, was shot and killed by police during a traffic stop. Authorities say they recovered a handgun at the scene. \nParkton, N.C. : A man was shot and killed during an armed standoff with police officers. \nChicago : 22-year-old was found dead on a sidewalk with multiple gunshot wounds in the early hours of Sunday morning. \nAugusta, Ga .: Darrell Brown, 8, was fatally shot by his uncle Sunday afternoon. \nSan Antonio: A man in his 20s was fatally shot in a drive-by shooting Sunday afternoon. \nBaltimore : A 24-year-old man was fatally shot during an armed robbery in the early hours of the morning. \nBaltimore : Another 24-year-old man was found fatally shot in the head on Myrtle Avenue about 8:30 a.m. \nCorrection: An earlier version listed an incorrect state for the city of Parkton.

Einstein did not believe they could ever be measured.\nWeiss also said that the win affirmed the importance of the scientific process at a worrying time \u201cwhen rational reasoning associated with evidence isn\u2019t universally accepted.\u201d\n___\n1:30 p.m.\nKip Thorne, one of three scientists sharing this year\u2019s Nobel Physics Prize for their discovery in gravitational waves, says the award is \u201ca win for the human race as a whole.\u201d\n\u201cThese gravitational waves will be powerful ways for the human race to explore the universe - not for the next few years or decades but for the next few centuries,\u201d Thorne, of the California Institute of Technology, told The Associated Press.\nThorne shared the award with Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Barry Barish, also of CalTech for their observation of faint ripples flying through the universe called gravitational waves. The waves were first predicted by Albert Einstein a century ago, but Einstein was convinced they could never be measured.\nThorne said he was a \u201clittle disappointed\u201d that thousands other scientists who have worked on the project did not get to share the prize, adding: \u201cNevertheless I\u2019m tremendously pleased to accept this\u201d on their behalf.\n___\n1:20 p.m.\nClifford Will, a gravitational-wave expert at the University of Florida, says it was \u201cfabulous\u201d that the Nobel Physics Prize went to three scientists for their discovery in gravitational waves.\nObserving gravitational waves is important because they offer a new way to observe the universe, beyond light and particles, Will said. When two black holes merge, for example, they don\u2019t give off observable light. But with gravitational waves, \u201cyou can see these events.\u201d Or rather, hear them, since they are detected as if they were chirping sounds.\nWill said that in the merger of the two black holes that triggered the prize-winning detection, the event gave off more energy in the last two-tenths of a second than all the stars in the visible universe combined emitted during the same period. But on Earth, that was \u201cvery difficult to detect\u201d and required extremely precise instrumentation, he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very loud future for gravitational waves,\u201d he said. The next detections might come from the merger of two ultra-dense neutron stars, or a neutron star colliding with a black hole, he said.\n___\n1 p.m.\nBarry Barish, one of the scientists sharing this year\u2019s Nobel Physics Prize, said he had set an alarm in anticipation of a call from the Nobel team \u2014 though when it did come it beat his alarm.\nBarish, speaking by phone from Santa Monica, California, said he and his colleagues knew there was a good chance they would get recognized by the Nobel team. The call came at 2:41 a.m., beating his own alarm by 4 minutes.\n\u201cThere was some anticipation. But, the Swedish Academy is so secretive,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\nHe added Tuesday\u2019s announcement was \u201ca win for Einstein, and a very big one.\u201d\nBarish shared the award with Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technology for their discoveries in faint ripples flying through the universe called gravitational waves. The waves were first predicted by Albert Einstein a century ago, but Einstein was convinced they could never be measured.\n___\n11:55 a.m.\nThe Nobel Physics Prize 2017 has been awarded to three scientists for their discoveries in gravitational waves.\nThe three are Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Barry Barish and Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technology.\nThe German-born Weiss was awarded half of the 9-million-kronor ($1.1 million) prize amount and Thorne and Barish will split the other half.\n___\n7:10 a.m.\nThe Nobel Physics Prize honors big discoveries involving materials often too small to be seen by the naked eye.\nThe 2017 prize being announced Tuesday by Sweden\u2019s Royal Academy of Sciences comes with 9 million kronor ($1.1 million). For the past 25 years, the prize has been shared among multiple winners.\nThe 2016 prize went to three British-born researchers who applied the mathematical discipline of topology to help understand the workings of exotic matter such as superconductors and superfluids.

Labor unions and grassroots pro-independence groups are urging workers to hold partial or full-day strikes throughout Catalonia to protest alleged brutality by police during a referendum on the region\u2019s secession from Spain that left hundreds of people injured. (Bob Edme/Associated Press) By Associated Press By Associated Press October 3 at 7:31 AM \nBARCELONA, Spain \u2014 The Latest on Catalonia\u2019s disputed independence referendum and Spain\u2019s response (all times local): \n1:25 p.m. \nSpain\u2019s top official in Catalonia says he laments the violence that left hundreds of civilians and police injured during a disputed independence referendum but blames the regional separatist government for \u201cexposing citizens to danger.\u201d \nEnric Millo said Tuesday that \u201cnothing of this would have happened if the government wouldn\u2019t have declared itself in rebellion, breaking the orders of the courts and lying and tricking people.\u201d \nHe said Spain\u2019s National Police and Civil Guard anti-riot squads broke into schools designated as polling stations when it was clear that the regional Mossos d\u2019Esquadra police, controlled by the Catalan government, was not carrying out a judge\u2019s orders to impede the voting. \nHe also accused the grassroots groups driving the independence bid, the National Catalan Assembly and Omnium Cultural, and pro-independence mayors of \u201cplotting to break the law.\u201d \n___ \n1:05 p.m. \nSeveral hundred Barcelona port workers have held a demonstration outside the regional headquarters of Spain\u2019s ruling Popular Party chanting slogans against government policies and the alleged brutality of police during a disputed weekend referendum on Catalonia\u2019s secession that left hundreds of people injured. \nThe protest came as several small labor unions and grassroots pro-independence groups urged workers throughout Catalonia to go on partial or full-day strikes to protest the police actions during Sunday\u2019s voting. \nThe port workers threw wads of unused ballot papers from the vote into the air in the protest outside the party\u2019s office in downtown Barcelona. \nRegional police placed barriers outside the building to stop the crowd getting near the offices. \nThe protest lasted more than an hour. \n___ \n12:10 a.m. \nCredit ratings agency Moody\u2019s has warned that the increased tensions over the Spanish region of Catalonia\u2019s push for independence could hurt the country\u2019s overall debt worthiness. \nThe agency said the \u201cratcheting-up of tensions has negative credit implications\u201d that could be worsened if Catalonia\u2019s regional government declares independence after claiming victory in a local referendum they organized that was deemed illegal by Spain. \nMoody\u2019s said that the probability of Catalan independence remains low, mainly because it remains unclear that a majority of Catalans actually want independence. Participation in Sunday\u2019s vote was reportedly only 42 percent. It expects the sides to negotiate a deal for greater powers for the region. \nThe agency noted that Catalonia represents about a fifth of Spain\u2019s economy, with a high per capita GDP. So independence would seriously affect Spain\u2019s public finances. \n___ \n11:05 a.m. \nA prominent leader of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union has condemned the bloc\u2019s failure to clearly condemn the police violence that marred Sunday\u2019s contested independence vote in the Spanish region of Catalonia. \nNigel Farage said \u201cit is quite extraordinary to realize that this Union is prepared to turn a blind eye\u201d to events in Catalonia. \nHe told EU lawmakers that never \u201cdid I think we would see the police of a member state of the Union injuring 900 people in an attempt to stop them going out to vote.\u201d \nFarage attacked European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker for his silence about it during a speech to the assembly Tuesday, saying: \u201cWhat do we get from Mister Juncker today? Not a dicky-bird.\u201d \n___ \n10:55 a.m. \nCyprus says Spain\u2019s national sovereignty and territorial integrity need to be respected, arguing that the referendum on Catalonia\u2019s independence was carried out \u201cin violation\u201d of the Spanish constitution. \nIn a statement, the Foreign Ministry of the internationally recognized south of the Mediterranean island nation said Spain\u2019s unity must be upheld as well as its constitutional order. \nThe ministry said \u201cdialogue and restraint are only the way forward.\u201d \nCyprus itself was split into a breakaway Turkish Cypriot north and the Greek Cypriot south when Turkey invaded in 1974 following a coup by supporters of union the Greece. \nThe latest round of talks aimed at reunifying the island collapsed last July. \n___ \n9:35 a.m. \nTurkey\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman says respect for Spain\u2019s territorial integrity is a main \u201cprinciple.\u201d \nHuseyin Muftuoglu said in a statement issued early Tuesday that it was important that both sides abide by Spain\u2019s laws and avoid violence. \nHis comment follows Sunday\u2019s independence referendum in Catalonia that Spain\u2019s courts deemed illegal. More than 800 people were injured as riot police clashed with unarmed civilians trying to cast their ballots. \nMuftuoglu said Turkey believes Spain will overcome \u201csuch tests.\u201d \nTurkey, which is battling a Kurdish insurgency, has strongly opposed a referendum on independence by the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in neighboring Iraq, threatening economic sanctions and military action. \n___ \n8:45 a.m. \nLabor unions and grassroots pro-independence groups are urging workers to hold partial or full-day strikes throughout Catalonia to protest alleged brutality by police during a referendum on the region\u2019s secession from Spain that left hundreds of people injured. \nThe strike call comes as Catalan leaders ponder a possible declaration of independence this week following the referendum that Spain said was illegal and invalid. \nPort workers were being called to demonstrate Tuesday outside the regional headquarters of Spain\u2019s ruling Popular Party while firefighters planned a rally outside the Interior Ministry\u2019s regional office in the Catalan capital of Barcelona. \nProtests were also to be staged outside polling stations where police acted with force to try to prevent Sunday\u2019s poll being held. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

But the response to the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, which has left at least 59 dead and hundreds more wounded, reveals a great deal about our politics.\nHere are 10 takeaways:\n1. No new gun laws will pass.\nThe National Rifle Association deserves more credit than any other outside group for Donald Trump\u2019s victory, and the president knows it. \u201cYou came through big for me, and I am going to come through for you,\u201d he said at the NRA\u2019s April convention in Atlanta.\nVirtually no Republican in Congress, and certainly no one in leadership, is willing to cross the powerful gun lobby. Even if Trump decided he wanted to act, which he will not, his party would block him.\n2. But Vegas makes it much harder for Republicans to roll back existing gun laws.\nIn the wake of the attack, House Republican leaders have decided to table a bill that would loosen restrictions on purchasing gun silencers. At least for now. \u201cThat bill, introduced by Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), has been approved by the Natural Resources Committee and was expected to be on the House floor soon, though it had not yet been scheduled for a vote,\u201d Politico reports . \u201cConsideration of the bill was (already) postponed earlier this year after Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) was shot in June at a congressional baseball practice.\u201d\n\u201c Rep. Richard Hudson's (R-N.C.) proposal to allow concealed-carry permit holders to take their guns with them across state lines also faces new political problems ,\u201d per John Bresnahan , Heather Caygle and Burgess Everett. \u201cThe Duncan legislation includes a provision revising federal regulations on silencers, which currently have tougher purchasing requirements than other guns. A different provision in the Duncan bill makes it more difficult for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to classify certain ammunition as \u2018armor piercing.\u2019 Regulations on interstate transportation weapons would be revised as well.\u201d\n3. There will be at least some new converts for gun control. After spending the night fearing for his life, the lead guitarist for the Josh Abbot Band \u2014 a Texas-based country group \u2014 announced that he has changed his position. \u201cI\u2019ve been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life. Until the events of last night. I cannot express how wrong I was. We actually have members of our crew with [Concealed Handgun Licenses], and legal firearms on the bus,\u201d Caleb Keeter wrote in a statement . \u201cThey were useless. \u2026 We need gun control RIGHT. NOW.\u201d\n4. Gun control will be a litmus test for Democrats in 2020.\nIt is inconceivable that Democrats will nominate someone for president who is not an outspoken proponent of tough new gun laws. Bernie Sanders was on the defensive throughout the 2016 Democratic primaries over his moderate record on guns, which reflects the culture of his home state of Vermont. Hillary Clinton successfully used this as a wedge issue to squeeze him from the left.\nMany presidential aspirants, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), quickly moved past the normal niceties after a tragedy and were agitating for tough laws within hours of Vegas. They know nothing will pass, but they are laying a marker.\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who represents Newtown, has become the most forceful advocate for action in the 2020 field. \u201cIt's time for Congress to get off its ass and do something,\u201d he said. ( Read Murphy\u2019s op-ed in today\u2019s Post. )\nMany rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers are beginning to boycott \u201cthe predictable moments of unification that commonly occur in the hours after mass shootings \u2014 hoping their refusal to participate will call attention to the inaction ,\u201d the Boston Globe\u2019s Annie Linskey reports . \u201cTo have only a moment of silence where there never is action taken, tragedy after tragedy, that is not something I want to be a part of,\u201d said Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), who led the sit-in on the House floor after the shooting in Orlando.\n5. The Vegas attack has pushed gun control to the front burner of the neck-and-neck race for Virginia governor . \u201cAt a previously scheduled forum in Vienna \u2026 Democrat Ralph Northam and Republican Ed Gillespie offered condolences. But the partisan divide over guns in Virginia, a Southern state with a strong gun tradition that was shaken by the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, was immediately evident,\u201d Fenit Nirappil reports . \u201cNortham, a former Army doctor who has an F rating from the National Rifle Association, decried what he called \u2018a proliferation of guns\u2019 in society and urged gun-control measures. Gillespie, who has an A rating and an endorsement from the NRA, asked for a moment of silence, later telling reporters that it was too soon to discuss policy. \u2026 Gillespie is opposed to further restrictions on guns and promised to reverse an executive order signed by Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) that bans guns in state government buildings.\u201d\nFormer congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who has crusaded for new gun laws since barely surviving a 2011 assassination attempt at a public event in her district, canceled plans to campaign for Northam on Monday in Virginia: \u201cAmericans for Responsible Solutions, Giffords\u2019s gun-control group, has pledged to spend $150,000 on pro-Northam mailings. Northam is also backed by Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, a group bankrolled by former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg (I) that is spending at least $700,000 on his campaign.\u201d The NRA, which planned to run political advertising in Virginia starting Tuesday through Election Day on Nov. 7, delayed its commercials for one week : \u201cThe gun rights group plans to spend more than $750,000 on commercials in the Richmond and Roanoke markets.\u201d (The group is headquartered in the commonwealth.) The debate about guns could help Gillespie bring home Trump supporters who backed his rival, Corey Stewart, in the June Republican primary. Conservatives who may not like the former RNC chairman will vote for him if they believe Northam wants to restrict their rights. The back-and-forth might also nationalize the race, which works against Gillespie in an environment where Trump remains unpopular.\n-- Sneak peek: Speaking of the Trump dynamic, Northam will unveil a new ad today that touts his willingness to stand up to the president. \u201cAs a doctor, nobody ever asks if I\u2019m a Democrat or a Republican. They just want my help,\u201d the lieutenant governor says to camera. \u201cSo if Donald Trump is helping Virginia, I\u2019ll work with him. But Donald Trump proposed cutting Virginia\u2019s school funding, rolling back our clean air and water protections, and taking away healthcare from thousands of Virginians. \u2026 I\u2019ve stood up to Donald Trump on all of it. Ed Gillespie refuses to stand up to him at all.\u201d\n6. The paranoid style in American politics is alive and well.\nTelevangelist Pat Robertson suggested yesterday that disrespect for Trump was a factor behind the shooting. \u201cViolence in the streets, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d he said on the Christian Broadcasting Network\u2019s \u201c700 Club.\u201d \u201cWhy is it happening? .\u2009.\u2009. The fact that we have disrespect for authority. There is profound disrespect of our president. All across this nation, they say terrible things about him. It\u2019s in the news. It\u2019s in other places. There is disrespect now for our national anthem, disrespect for our veterans, disrespect for the institutions of our government, disrespect for the court system. All the way up and down the line: disrespect. \u2026 Until there is Biblical authority, there has to be some controlling authority in our society and there is none. \u2026 When there is no vision of God, the people run amok. We have taken from the American people the vision of God.\u201d\nWayne Allyn Root, a columnist for the Sheldon Adelson-owned Las Vegas Review-Journal who warmed up crowds during Trump rallies in 2016, pushed the theory on Twitter that the shooter must be Muslim. After police announced that he was not, Root refused to back down or apologize .\n\u201c[G]overnment restrictions will not stop psychopaths from harming people. They will find a way,\u201d former Fox News anchor Bill O\u2019Reilly wrote on his blog . \u201cThis is the price of freedom. Violent nuts are allowed to roam free until they do damage, no matter how threatening they are. The Second Amendment is clear that Americans have a right to arm themselves for protection. Even the loons. \u201d\n-- To be sure, there are extreme views on both sides. CBS announced that it fired a company lawyer who wrote on Facebook yesterday that she was \u201cactually not even sympathetic\u201d to the shooting victims because \u201ccountry music fans often are Republican gun toters.\u201d \u201cIf they wouldn\u2019t do anything when children were murdered I have no hope that Repugs will ever do the right thing,\u201d she wrote.\n7. The fever swamps of the Internet have powerful megaphones, even when what\u2019s being yelled is false. \u201cGeary Danley was not the gunman \u2026 But for hours on the far-right Internet, would-be sleuths scoured Danley\u2019s Facebook likes, family photographs and marital history to try to \u2018prove\u2019 that he was,\u201d Abby Ohlheiser reports . \u201cDanley, according to an archived version of a Facebook page bearing that name, might have been married to a Marilou Danley. Police were looking for a woman by that name in the hours after the shooting, but later said they did not think she was involved. The briefest look at the viral threads and tweets falsely naming Geary Danley as the attacker makes it easy to guess why a bunch of right-wing trolls latched on to him: His Facebook profile indicated that he might be a liberal \u2026\n\u201c That phony story quickly embedded itself into the algorithms of Google and Facebook, where sites promoting the rumor remained at the top of the results for anyone searching for Danley\u2019s name. \u2026 For a time on Monday morning, one of those 4chan threads falsely naming Danley as the shooter was promoted by Google as a \u2018top story\u2019 for searches for his name \u2026 The right-wing news site Gateway Pundit [ which the White House has given press credentials to ] also picked up these rumors as fact in a now-deleted article. \u2026 And on Facebook, a search for articles about Geary Danley promoted seven links leading to inaccurate stories about him. The eighth result is a debunking. \u201d ( BuzzFeed debunks 19 other hoaxes that spread online after the shooting. )\nThese are many of the same people that promoted Pizzagate, and the fact that the fake stories got as much visibility and traction as they did suggests that search giants and social media platforms still have a lot of work to do before they can be considered responsible corporate actors.\n8. More than ever, in a polarized and fragmented country, comedians are emerging as prominent voices of moral authority.\nEvery late-night TV comedian except Jimmy Fallon opened his show last night with a serious monologue about what transpired in Vegas. Emily Yahr writes up what each of them said : \u201cTrevor Noah and James Corden were in disbelief over American gun culture. Conan O\u2019Brien was devastated to realize how many times he\u2019s had to talk about mass shootings. Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers urged Congress to take action on gun control.\u201d\nJimmy Kimmel has clearly been emboldened by the role he played in stopping the Cassidy-Graham health-care bill from passing last week. The ABC host was in tears on his show last night as he spoke about the \u201cterrible, inexplicable, shocking and painful tragedy\u201d in his hometown of Las Vegas. Kimmel choked up several times during a 10-minute speech. He called out Trump, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan by name. \u201cThey should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country, because it\u2019s so crazy,\u201d he said. ( Read a full transcript of the monologue here. ) Click below to watch:\nWatch Conan:\nWatch Noah:\nWatch Meyers:\nWatch Corden:\n9. The polling on guns is much more complicated and nuanced than most of the mainstream media\u2019s coverage might lead you to believe. \u201cDemocrats are fond of pointing out that 8 in 10 or 9 in 10 Americans favor expanded background checks for gun purchases. That's true, but it also masks another important reality: Republicans just don't think legislation is the answer, period ,\u201d Aaron Blake writes on The Fix . \u201cIn June 2016, Quinnipiac University asked whether people supported a ban on \u2018assault weapons\u2019 \u2014 a.k.a. semiautomatic ones. About 6 in 10 Americans (59 percent) supported it, including 4 in 10 Republicans (40 percent). But when the pollster asked whether such a ban would be effective in reducing gun violence, Americans actually disagreed by a small margin, 49-47. Just 24 percent of Republicans thought it would be effective, while 70 percent said it wouldn't.\n\u201cThe story was similar on background checks: While 93 percent of all people and 90 percent of Republicans said they supported background checks for all gun purchases, only 62 percent overall and 42 percent of Republicans thought it would actually reduce gun violence. A majority of Republicans (53 percent) again felt it wouldn't help at all. \u2026 And if you don't think these address the problem, you're more likely to believe specific proposals overreach into \u2018gun grabs.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cAnd in fact, multiple polls have shown a large percentage of Americans think the answer is more guns, not fewer. A Washington Post-ABC News poll that same month showed that 54 percent would encourage more people to carry guns legally for self-defense. Just 42 percent discouraged it.\u201d\n10. Regardless of the polling, the truth is that America\u2019s deadliest shooting incidents are getting much deadlier . Philip Bump charts how the death toll of these massacres has grown over time:\nWHAT HAPPENED:\n-- \u201cUnder the neon glow and glitz of the Vegas Strip, thousands of concertgoers who had gathered for a three-day music festival dove for cover or raced toward shelter when the gunfire began at about 10 p.m. Sunday,\u201d Heather Long, Mark Berman and Derek Hawkins report . \u201cPolice said more than 22,000 people were at the concert when Paddock began firing round after round, shooting from an elevated position that left those on the ground effectively helpless. The typical advice for reacting to an active shooter \u2014 \u2018run, hide or fight\u2019 \u2014 was rendered moot, as many in the packed crowd could not easily run or hide, nor were they able to fight back at someone firing from so far away.\u201d\nIn video footage, concertgoers can be seen screaming and running for cover \u2014 though they did not immediately know from what. \u201cWe thought it was fireworks at first or trouble with the speakers,\u201d said Kayla Ritchie, 21. \u201c[Then] everything went dark.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until [singer Jason] Aldean fled the stage and the lights came on that 21-year-old Taylor Benge said he realized that \u201cabout five feet to the left of me, there was a man with a bullet wound to his chin.\u201d \u201cHe was just lifeless on the ground,\u201d Benge said. -- \u201cOutside, The Strip, always a blizzard of dazzling lights and honking horns, almost instantly turned into a frenzied hive of pulsing police lights and sirens,\u201d Michael Lyle, Heather Long and Marc Fisher report . \u201cPeople fled every which way, many taking cellphone video of their run to safety. [Former minor league baseball player Todd Blyleven, who traveled from Dallas for the concert with his wife and friends], helped carry out the lifeless body of a young woman. He saw a police officer who looked like he had taken a bullet in the neck. \u2018Young girls and guys, older folks, just people walking out of a country concert with bullet holes,\u2019 Blyleven said.\u201d\n-- \u201cAldean was barely five measures into \u2018 When She Says Baby ,\u2019 when the shots started,\u201d Avi Selk and Amy B Wang report . \u201c\u2019Is that gunfire?\u2019 [Singer Jason] Owen remembered thinking[.] The gunfire continued, steady against the beat of the song \u2026 Shot after shot, faster and faster. Aldean sprinted off the stage. Owen ran, too. So did other singers, workers and all the thousands of spectators \u2014 fleeing and screaming, falling and dying.\u201d\n-- A fire alarm triggered by gun smoke let first responders zero in on the shooter\u2019s location. SWAT team members then used explosives to get inside, where they found [Paddock] dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. \u201cWe believe the individual killed himself prior to our entry,\u201d the sheriff said. ( Cleve R. Wootson Jr .)\n-- \u201cI realized people were dying\": Photographer David Becker spoke to The Post's photo editor MaryAnne Golon about witnessing the attack and capturing some of the most haunting images from the night: \u201c It had been so dark outside I couldn\u2019t see the details. I just saw a lot of people laying on the ground thinking they were playing possum, but now I could see people covered in blood and I thought, this is real. When I saw the image of the woman lying on the ground covered in blood, that was when the impact of what I was experiencing hit \u2014 when I realized people were dying.\u201d\nJessica Klymchuk was among the victims. (Social media/Reuters)\nTHE VICTIMS:\n-- Only a handful of the 59 victims so far have been identified. They range in age from 20 to nearly 60 and came from across the country for the music festival. They included a single mother of four, a registered nurse and a Las Vegas police officer. The Post will keep updating this running list as more names are released .\nOne of the victims was a 29-year-old celebrating his first wedding anniversary: \"Heather Melton said her husband [Sonny] saved her life while gunfire was hitting the crowd. \u2018He saved my life. He grabbed me and started running when I felt him get shot in the back,\u2019 she said. \u2018I want everyone to know what a kindhearted, loving man he was, but at this point, I can barely breathe.\u2019\u201d ( WSMV of Nashville ) Sandy Casey, a special-education teacher, had recently gotten engaged. She was attending the concert with her fiance, Christopher Willemse, and friends when she was struck in her lower back. She died in Willemse\u2019s arms as he attempted to carry her to safety.\nAngie Gomez was just 20 and went to the festival to celebrate her new job as a certified nursing assistant. Her boyfriend of five years and several strangers attempted to get her to a hospital, but she died before receiving medical attention.\nJohn Phippen, 57, traveled to Las Vegas from California with his son Travis. As the gunshots first rang out, Phippen jumped on top of his son and saved his life. Travis, who has experience as a medic, went on to treat more than a dozen of the injured, despite taking a bullet to the arm.\nJonathan Smith, 30, saved ~30 people last night before he was shot in the neck.

Heather Long reports : \u201cSmith was focused on saving his young nieces, but they separated in the crowd. \u2026 He grabbed people and told them to follow him toward a handicapped parking area in the direction of the airport, away from Las Vegas Boulevard. It was a large field with several rows of vehicles. Smith and the others crouched down behind one of the last rows of cars. \u2026 A few young girls weren\u2019t fully hidden. He stood up and moved toward them to urge them to get on the ground. That\u2019s when a bullet struck him in the neck. \u2026 \u2018I don\u2019t see myself [as a hero],\u2019 he said. \u2018I would want someone to do the same for me. No one deserves to lose a life coming to a country festival.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a guy who lived in Mesquite who liked burritos,\u201d is how Eric Paddock described his brother, Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock pic.twitter.com/q3MUgIa2Ws\n\u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) October 2, 2017 THE SHOOTER:\n-- Stephen Paddock, 64, was described as a high-stakes gambler who mostly kept to himself at a quiet retirement community outside Las Vegas. Neighbors said he would disappear for \u201cdays at a time,\u201d frequenting casinos with his longtime girlfriend, Marilou Danley. William Wan, Sandhya Somashekhar, Aaron C. Davis and Barbara Liston have more:\nRelatives expressed bewilderment and told authorities they were not aware of any mental illness or substance abuse problems: \u201cEric Paddock said he knew of five guns his brother kept in his safe but was shocked that a rapid-fire weapon was used in Sunday\u2019s shooting. He said his brother didn\u2019t hunt, barely shot his guns and once took Eric Paddock\u2019s children on a skeet-shooting trip paid for by the casinos.\u201d\nHe liked to wager tens of thousands of dollars in a single sitting: \u201cHe owned homes in four states but preferred staying in casino hotels, sometimes for weeks at a time .\u2009.\u2009. He was worth more than $2 million , relatives said. At various points of his life, Stephen Paddock worked for defense contractor Lockheed Martin and as an accountant and property manager. As a retiree, he had no children and plenty of money to play with. So he took up gambling. \u2018It\u2019s like a job for him. It\u2019s a job where you make money,\u2019 said Eric Paddock, adding that his brother could lose $1 million and still have enough to live on.\u2019\u201d\nFor several years, the gunman lived with his girlfriend, Marilou Danley, in a retirement community in Reno: \u201c[Neighbors] said they interacted with Danley but not with Paddock, whom they described as extremely standoffish. .\u2009.\u2009. Harold Allred, who lives up the street from the couple, said his wife often ran into Danley in exercise classes or social gatherings. Allred said he and his wife found Danley unremarkable, though perhaps a little odd, and didn\u2019t know Paddock. \u2018He was reclusive,\u2019 said Allred, 66. \u2018We never met him.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cPaddock\u2019s father, Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, was on the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted list, described on a 1969 wanted poster as \u2018psychopathic\u2019 with suicidal tendencies. He escaped from prison that year and, according to news accounts, was not captured until 1978, when he was nabbed while running a bingo parlor in Oregon.\u201d\nTHE WEAPONS:\n-- Even after searching his home, investigators are still trying to figure out Paddock\u2019s motive. \"[Authorities] said hotel staff had been in and out of the two-room suite, which Paddock had stayed in since Sept. 28, and spotted nothing \u2018nefarious,\u2019 though he had more than 10 suitcases,\u201d Matt Zapotosky, Devlin Barrett and Mark Berman report .\n-- Authorities said Paddock had a cache of 23 firearms in his possession. Michael S. Rosenwald, Devlin Barrett and Alex Horton report : \u201cOne of the weapons Paddock apparently [used] was an AK-47 type rifle, with a stand to steady it for firing[.] \u2026 Investigators believe at least one of the guns functioned as if it were fully automatic and are now working to determine whether he modified it or others to be capable of spitting out a high volume of fire just by holding down the trigger[.] But video from the attack suggests Paddock may have used at least one fully automatic rifle, marking the first time such a weapon has been wielded by a public mass shooter in the United States.\u201d\nTHE TRUMP RESPONSE:\n-- The White House repeatedly insisted yesterday that it was not appropriate to talk about policy on the day of a tragedy. \u201cThere will certainly be a time for that policy discussion to take place, but that\u2019s not the place that we\u2019re in at this moment,\u201d said press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n-- But Trump selectively politicizes events, whenever they work to his advantage. \u201cTime and time again, he has capitalized on terror to advance his agenda,\u201d write Michael Scherer and Philip Rucker . \u201cAfter a bomb attack on a train in London in September, Trump called for a \u2018far larger, tougher and more specific\u2019 travel ban \u2026 well before London authorities had declared that terrorism was the cause. When an indebted gambler assaulted a Manila casino in June, killing dozens by starting a fire, Trump called the event \u2018terrorism\u2019 at the White House, even though local police later said the attack was a robbery attempt unconnected to terrorism. During his campaign, Trump made the shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. \u2026 a centerpiece of his proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. And Trump reacted to the shooting at an Orlando nightclub with self-praise, suggesting that the incident was a symptom of weak Democratic policies.\n\u201cThe Las Vegas massacre was different, both because investigators have found no evidence linking the shooter to a terrorist organization and because he was a white American, as opposed to a Muslim immigrant,\u201d Scherer and Rucker write. \u201cThe emerging facts prevented Trump from following his typical playbook \u2014 to rally his supporters against Islamic extremism while speaking and tweeting in a combative, even belligerent tone to try to project strength and resolve. Rather, Trump uttered just 574 words on Monday and tried to play the role of uniter.\u201d\n-- \u201cMass shootings are so frequent in America that the political responses to them have become ritualized to the point of parody,\u201d Ryan Lizza writes in the New Yorker . \u201cTrump \u2026 read haltingly from a teleprompter in the Diplomatic Reception Room, where F.D.R. once calmed Depression- and Second World War-era America with his fireside chats. It was not Trump\u2019s worst public performance. He stayed on script, and read a short and well-crafted statement without making any bizarre Trumpian asides. But it was a classic of the \u2018thoughts and prayers\u2019 model in that it offered no promise of a policy response whatsoever. \u2026 Near the end of his speech, Trump said that \u2018even the most terrible despair can be illuminated by a single ray of hope.\u2019 If your hope was that Washington would start to grapple with a response to the crisis of mass shootings, the President didn\u2019t offer a single ray.\u201d\n-- David Frum, who was a speechwriter in George W. Bush\u2019s White House, says Trump\u2019s comments were \u201csteeped in hypocrisy\u201d: \u201cHe is the least outwardly religious president of modern times, the president least steeped in scripture. For him to offer the consolations of God and faith after mass bloodletting is to invite derision. \u2018It is love that defines us,\u2019 said President Trump, and if we weren\u2019t heartbroken, we would laugh. Those who praised the speech, as CNN\u2019s John King did, are reacting on reflex. This is the kind of thing we are used to hearing from Republican politicians; Trump is a Republican politician; therefore this is what he should say\u2026\n\u201cBut whereas Vice President Pence could have pronounced those words with sincerity, or a convincing simulacrum thereof, Donald Trump looked shifty, nervous, and false,\u201d Frum writes in The Atlantic . Speeches are watched as well as heard, and the viewer saw a president who wished he were somewhere else because he had been compelled to pretend something so radically false to his own nature. For once, Trump read the speech exactly as written. Perhaps his aides talked him into it. Because Trump is not a good reader, he read the speech wrong. And because it sounded wrong, he looked bad.\u201d\nListen to James's quick summary of today's Big Idea and the headlines you need to know to start your day: Subscribe to The Daily 202\u2019s Big Idea on\nAmazon Echo , Google Home , Apple Podcasts and other podcast players. -- POSTPONED: The Daily 202 Live with Mick Mulvaney.

He went into cardiac arrest and was rushed to a hospital, leading some outlets to erroneously report his death earlier on Monday. Petty\u2019s longtime manager confirmed the sad news last night.\nHarrison Smith and Adam Bernstein with his obituary : \u201cMr. Petty and his band, the Heartbreakers, released their self-titled debut in 1976 and soon drew comparisons to the bluesy, guitar-heavy rock of the Rolling Stones and the Byrds. Their music was unabashedly sentimental, seeming to speak to striving, everyday Americans no less than the songs of fellow rocker Bruce Springsteen[.] \u2026 The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Mr. Petty and the Heartbreakers in 2002. \u2018I\u2019d like to see us break some new ground and leave some sort of mark on the music,\u2019 Mr. Petty once said \u2026 \u2018If you could make some little dent in rock, where that little area is yours \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019m striving for now.\u2019\u201d\n-- Americans Rainer Weiss, Barry C.

Paul Manafort talks to reporters on the floor of the Republican National Convention. (Matt Rourke/AP)\nTHERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n-- Trump associates have given investigators documents showing two previously unreported contacts with Russia during the 2016 campaign. Tom Hamburger, Rosalind S. Helderman and Adam Entous report : \u201cIn one case, Trump\u2019s personal attorney and a business associate exchanged emails weeks before the Republican National Convention about traveling to an economic conference in Russia that would be attended by top Russian financial and government leaders, including [Vladimir Putin] \u2026 In the other case, the same Trump attorney, Michael Cohen, received a proposal in late 2015 for a Moscow residential project from a company founded by a billionaire who once served in the Russian Senate[.]\u201d\n\u201cCohen declined the invitation to the economic conference [and] rejected the Moscow building plan . But the new disclosures add to an emerging picture in which Trump\u2019s business and campaign were repeatedly contacted by Russians with interests in business and politics.\u201d Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Michael Cohen have been revealed to have fielded such inquiries from Moscow in the weeks before or after Trump accepted the Republican nomination. \u201cThe June 2016 email to Cohen about the economic conference came from Felix Sater, a Russian-born real estate developer and former Trump business associate. Sater encouraged Cohen to attend the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, with Sater telling Cohen that he could be introduced to [Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev], top financial leaders and perhaps to Putin \u2026. At one point, Sater told Cohen that Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, could help arrange the discussions \u2026\u201d -- The Atlantic\u2019s Julia Ioffe and Franklin Foer obtained the full emails exchanged between Manafort and an international intermediary to get a message to Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, which were first reported by The Post . \u201c[T]he full text of these exchanges \u2026 shows that Manafort attempted to leverage his leadership role in the Trump campaign to curry favor with a Russian oligarch close to [Putin]. Manafort was deeply in debt, and did not earn a salary from the Trump campaign. There is no evidence that Deripaska met with Manafort in 2016, or knew about Manafort\u2019s attempts to reach him. Yet the extended correspondence between Manafort and [the intermediary] paints a more complete portrait of Manafort\u2019s willingness to trade on his campaign position. \u201d\n-- The top legal counsel on Robert Mueller\u2019s team, Michael Dreeben, has reportedly been researching the limits of presidential pardons. Bloomberg\u2019s Greg Farrell reports : \u201cPre-emptive pardons are a distinct possibility now that current and former Trump advisers are under Mueller\u2019s scrutiny. Trump himself has tweeted that everyone agrees the U.S. president has \u2018complete power to pardon.\u2019 \u2026 [T]he legal territory is largely uncharted over pardons of a president\u2019s own campaign workers, family members or even himself -- and how prosecutors\u2019 work would then be affected. What Dreeben brings to the question, say those who know him, is a credibility that comes from parsing how criminal prosecutions have played out across the country.\u201d\n-- Freshman Rep. Ron Estes (R-Kan.) booked a basement room in the Capitol for former congressman Connie Mack (R-Fla.) to hold a sham hearing for his Ukrainian lobbying client. The Daily Beast\u2019s Betsy Woodruff and Andrew Desiderio report : \u201c[T]he fake \u2018hearing\u2019 was broadcast in full on Ukraine\u2019s NewsOne and described to viewers as the \u2018U.S. Congressional Committee on Financial Issues.\u2019 But not a single member of Congress attended. The network teased the \u2018shocking details\u2019 about the \u2018highest levels of corruption in the NBU,\u2019 referring to the National Bank of Ukraine. \u2026 A pamphlet handed out to attendees was evaluated by a Ukrainian fact-checking website as having \u2018mostly correct\u2019 data about the NBU but \u2018manipulated in almost all occasions.\u2019\u201d Mack lobbies on behalf of Interconnection Commerce \u2014 which was implicated in the Pentagon Papers \u2014 as well as Hungary\u2019s Putin-allied political party.\n-- The Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), said that the CIA denied the committee\u2019s request to review information about Russian meddling that has already been seen by the chamber\u2019s intelligence committee. ( Politico )\nRussian President Vladimir Putin drives a motor boat at the cascade of mountain lakes in Siberia. (European Pressphoto Agency/Nikolsky/Sputnik)\nMOSCOW IS USING OUR OWN TECH TOOLS AGAINST US:\n-- By using Facebook\u2019s powerful \u201cCustom Audience\u201d tool to identify American voters susceptible to propaganda \u2014 and then targeting them with messages designed to influence their voting behavior \u2014 Russian operatives exploited a system used frequently by U.S. corporations. Elizabeth Dwoskin, Craig Timberg and Adam Entous report : \u201cThe Web sites and Facebook pages displayed ads or other messages focused on such hot-button issues as illegal immigration, African American political activism and the rising prominence of Muslims in the United States. The Russian operatives then used a Facebook \u2018retargeting\u2019 tool, called Custom Audiences, to send specific ads and messages to voters who had visited those sites.\u201d\nOne Russian-bought ad featured photographs of an armed black woman \u201cdry-firing\u201d a rifle , or pulling the trigger without a bullet in the chamber , which investigators believe may have been designed to stoke racial tensions. Another showed an image of Hillary Clinton behind what appear to be prison bars. \u201cThe conclusions of investigators fit those of several independent researchers, who say that the Russian disinformation campaign exploited the core advertising and tracking technologies that Silicon Valley has honed over a decade \u2026 and which are widely available, with few if any restrictions, to political actors in the United States and abroad.\u201d Facebook delivered more than 3,000 ads to congressional investigators on Monday: \u201c[Facebook] is also sharing information on which users those ads were designed to target, how many users viewed or clicked on those ads, and the payment methods used by the Russians. The company said Monday that modeling shows these ads were seen by roughly 10 million users. An estimated 44 percent were seen before the Nov. 8 election, and the rest were seen afterward.\u201d -- Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said he hopes to make public a sampling of Russia-linked Facebook ads that were turned over to Congress on Monday \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d \u201cThe American people deserve to see the ways that the Russian intelligence services manipulated and took advantage of online platforms to stoke and amplify social and political tensions, which remains a tactic we see the Russian government rely on today,\u201d said Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.\n-- HP Enterprise allowed a Russian defense agency to scrutinize the cyberdefense system used by the Pentagon to guard its computer networks , potentially helping Moscow identify weaknesses in the software . Reuters\u2019s Joel Schectman, Dustin Volz and Jack Stubbs report : \u201cThe HPE system, called ArcSight, serves as a cybersecurity nerve center for much of the U.S. military, alerting analysts when it detects that computer systems may have come under attack. ArcSight is also widely used in the private sector. The Russian review of ArcSight\u2019s source code, the closely guarded internal instructions of the software, was part of HPE\u2019s effort to win the certification required to sell the product to Russia\u2019s public sector, according to the regulatory records \u2026 Six former U.S. intelligence officials, as well as former ArcSight employees and independent security experts, said the source code review could help Moscow discover weaknesses in the software, potentially helping attackers to blind the U.S. military to a cyber attack.\u201d\nIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner talk before a joint news conference with Donald Trump and the Lebanese prime minister. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\nTHE TRUMP EMAILS:\n-- White House officials are looking into a THIRD email account on Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump\u2019s private domain, which received hundreds of messages from White House addresses. Politico\u2019s Josh Dawsey and Andrea Peterson report : \u201cThe emails \u2014 which include nonpublic travel documents, internal schedules and some official White House materials \u2014 were in many cases sent from Ivanka Trump, her assistant Bridges Lamar and others who work with the couple in the White House. The emails to the third account were largely sent from White House accounts but occasionally came from other private accounts[.] \u2026 The existence of additional accounts on the family domain \u2026 raises new questions about the extent of personal email use by the couple during their time as White House aides.\u201d (This may violate the Presidential Records Act.)\nHURRICANE MARIA FALLOUT:\n-- Trump will visit Puerto Rico today. Arelis Hern\u00e1ndez, Dan Lamothe and Joel Achenbach report on how the island\u2019s situation became desperate: \u201cWhen things went bad during Hurricane Maria, they went bad all at once, across this entire island. Suddenly, everything was dysfunctional, including the power grid, the cellphone towers, the banking system. \u2026 The difficulty in responding to Maria has revealed how unique each disaster is \u2014 and how resistant to a one-size-fits-all approach. \u2026 For Maria, numerous Coast Guard and FEMA urban-search-and-rescue teams were on hand or arrived quickly. But it soon became clear that what people needed most were life-sustaining provisions \u2014 including water, food and diesel fuel for generators \u2014 that the search-and-rescue teams didn\u2019t have.\u201d\n-- During his visit, Trump may see San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, his most recent Twitter target. Abby Phillip reports : \u201c[T]he White House seemed to be downplaying his harsh criticism of Cruz, saying she had been invited to participate in the official visit. \u2018Look, right now our focus is to bring the mayor into the coordination efforts,\u2019 said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \u2018This administration, as well as other members on the ground, have reached out to her.\u2019 \u2018We hope that she will join with us in those efforts and be part of things,\u2019 she added.\u201d\n-- Meanwhile, the Trump administration is planning to ask Congress for another $10 billion in relief funding. Ed O\u2019Keefe reports : \u201c[O]fficials [in Puerto Rico] and some lawmakers on the mainland are clamoring for legislation that would provide tens of billions of dollars in relief and address Puerto Rico\u2019s long-simmering fiscal crisis, shore up its bankrupt electric company and plug a shortfall in Medicaid funding. \u2026 [Carmelo] R\u00edos, the Puerto Rico Senate\u2019s majority leader, warned that Congress should act quickly. If it doesn\u2019t, he expects 100,000 to 200,000 island residents to relocate, at least temporarily, to the mainland United States in the coming weeks.\u201d\n-- Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee are proposing to combine $1 billion in extra Medicaid funding to Puerto Rico with the renewal of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Paige Winfield Cunningham reports : \u201c[The proposal] would be paid for with a bucket of items, including raising Medicare rates for wealthier seniors, redirecting dollars from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s prevention fund and shortening a grace period for enrollees who don\u2019t pay their premiums. \u2026 The funding, which would be provided to Puerto Rico over a two-year period, would be part of a package to fund [CHIP], community health centers and other health-care extenders.\u201d\n-- School districts along the entire East Coast are preparing to take on an influx of new Puerto Rican students as some families leave the island. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Joseph De Avila and Arian Campo-Flores report : \u201cThe Miami-Dade County school district has enrolled about a dozen Puerto Rican children. \u2018I think that number will grow exponentially,\u2019 said Alberto Carvalho, superintendent of Miami-Dade Public Schools. \u2026 Boston schools, which have a 42% Hispanic population out of about 57,000 students, are setting up one-stop centers with nonprofit groups where families will be able to enroll students, get language assessments and obtain winter clothing[.] \u2026 Officials with New York City schools, the largest district in the U.S., with 1.1 million students, have been meeting regularly to prepare for the arrival of Puerto Rican evacuees[.]\u201d\nThis is a GOP tax plan? Possibly 30% of middle class gets a tax hike? I hope the final details are better than this. https://t.co/lcjkI4YRz8\n\u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) October 2, 2017 THE AGENDA:\n-- The fight over the GOP's tax plan begins, with friendly fire from both Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Bob Corker (Tenn.). Kelsey Snell reports : \u201cNeither Paul nor Corker said he was firmly against the bill, but any GOP split over the tax framework creates a potentially perilous negotiation in the Senate[.] \u2026 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said plans to finance tax cuts by adding to the deficit could be a problem for some Republicans but he is confident that economic growth will more than compensate for short-term losses.\u201d\n-- Trump is considering an executive order that would trigger a review of the American welfare system. Politico\u2019s Andrew Restuccia reports : \u201c[T]he draft order calls on agencies to review existing regulations and propose new rules that conform to a set of broad welfare principles, including tighter work requirements that encourage recipients to shift back into the labor force \u2026 Administration backers of the welfare executive order hope he signs it before Thanksgiving , one of the officials said. But another official cautioned that the conversations about the order are \u2018very preliminary at this stage,\u2019 adding that the final outcome is uncertain.\u201d\n-- Since taking office, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has had numerous meetings with top energy executives and almost none with environmental groups. The New York Times\u2019s Eric Lipton and Lisa Friedman reports : \u201cIn just the first 15 days of May, Mr. Pruitt met with the chief executive of the Chemours Company, a leading chemical maker, as well as three chemical lobbying groups; the egg producers lobby; the president of Shell Oil Company; the chief executive of Southern Company; lobbyists for the farm bureau, the toy association and a cement association; the president of a truck equipment manufacturer seeking to roll back emissions regulations for trucks; and the president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. \u2026 Mr. Pruitt also has made frequent, government-funded trips to his home state of Oklahoma, even when the journeys included only a bit of official business.\u201d\nLeft: Doug Jones chats with constituents before a Democratic Senate candidate forum.

(Brynn Anderson/AP)\nOFF TO THE RACES:\n-- Democrats are debating whether to commit extensive resources to Doug Jones\u2019s Senate race against Roy Moore in Alabama , where they haven't competed in a serious Senate battle since 1996 . The New York Times\u2019s Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns report : \u201cDemocrats here and in Washington believe that their nominee \u2026 is the most formidable candidate they have fielded for the Senate in this state in over two decades. \u2026 Some in the party believe that they simply cannot write off the South if they expect to regain control of Congress \u2014 and that they will never recover here if they abandon high-quality candidates such as Mr. Jones. But the Democratic brand has become so toxic in states such as Alabama that if the national party rallies behind Mr. Jones and turns his candidacy into a liberal cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, it could only doom him by pushing Republicans reluctant to support Mr. Moore back to their partisan corner. \u2026\n\u201cBut in the eyes of many Democrats, opposing Mr. Moore is as much a moral imperative as a political one. As [David] Axelrod put it, [Moore], who has a decades-long record of making incendiary comments about gays, African-Americans and Muslims, is so offensive to Democrats that it makes him \u2018hard to ignore.\u2019 \u2026 [James] Carville added, \u2018if you can\u2019t run against Roy Moore, then what kind of party you got?\u2019 \u201d\n-- A group of pro-Trump figures is launching a new super PAC seeking to take aim at the Republican establishment. The Atlantic\u2019s Rosie Gray reports : \u201cJeff Giesea, Mike Cernovich, and Jack Posobiec, organizers of the \u2018Deploraball\u2019 party to celebrate President Trump\u2019s inauguration earlier this year, are behind the super PAC, which is being called #Rev18.\"\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\nFormer congresswoman Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) offered her thoughts on Las Vegas:\nHeartbroken by the scene our nation is waking up to this morning.

Got it By Kieran Healy By Kieran Healy October 3 Blood stains and a discarded shoe lie in the street in the aftermath of the mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas. (EUGENE GARCIA/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock) \nIn the wake of terrible events like Sunday night\u2019s mass shooting in Las Vegas, people often wonder whether the United States is a particularly violent society. Several years ago, the same question led me to take a look at some comparative data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on the rates of death due to assault across different countries. The OECD now has this data for almost all its members from 1960 up to 2014 or 2015. Here is what it looks like. Assault Deaths in OECD countries, 1960-2015 \nThe short answer is that the United States is a society where an unusual number of people die violently, at least in comparison to other rich, capitalist democracies. That has been true for a long time, and it remains true even though far fewer people now die in the United States as the result of assault than at any time in the past 50 years. \nWhy this decline has happened is a matter of debate, with potential causes ranging from the demographic (a shift in the age structure of the population) to the organizational (better trauma care for those shot and wounded). As an officially recorded cause of death, \u201cassault\u201d does not pick out the exact mechanism of death, such as a gunshot vs. a stabbing, and so on. It does exclude intentional self-harm and accidents. But there is little doubt that the tendency for assault to be lethal in the United States has a great deal to do with the easy availability of guns. \nThe United States is not the most violent country in the world, or even the most violent in the OECD by this measure. Mexico has a much higher assault death rate, one that has spiked in the past decade. Estonia experienced a huge wave of (possibly alcohol-related ) homicides shortly after its independence in 1991 but has since receded to near-average levels. But when it comes to questions of living standards, public safety, and social policy, Americans do not typically rush to compare themselves with these countries, nor with more violent non-OECD nations such as Honduras or Kyrgyzstan. The countries in the blue zone in the graph include the likes of Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Britain. \nEven as overall rates of violent death decline, the horrific, high-visibility mass shooting appears to have become more common in the United States in recent years. It is by now well institutionalized as a mode of violence. When one happens, everybody knows what to do. The past decade has seen innovations in terrorist violence elsewhere in the OECD, too, such as random knife and acid attacks, or driving vehicles into crowds. These are similarly horrifying events and \u2014 at least the first few times they are tried \u2014 may lead to many fatalities. Do not look for them in the United States, though. Their lethality is intrinsically limited. Using a truck as a weapon is just less efficient than using a weapon as a weapon. For as long as powerful firearms remain easily available to private citizens, the United States is likely to remain well above the OECD average when it comes to violent death. \nKieran Healy is a professor of sociology at Duke University.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:18:53.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "78df453336a5eccee5d9198e7249216f5244e41e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgW0izAs9LRh8G2KxGkHYuwec_z5AaMlNuZ1ct6ZkQjf_Q6orFN3JuYWfw9H7HzG5wz5hwiUZBS5JJRwyI8D7OZXUUM1zoLVKw0ltQKg3ZIq4LWFHFtX1gAoiX_JG5kgXk5eAcFpJ5qHCHZp9uJIF6_Q--", "site_full": "www.washingtonpost.com", "site": "washingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "NFL on Yahoo!

By Adam Kilgore By Adam Kilgore October 3 at 8:00 AM Follow @adamkilgorewp Sean McDermott is giving the Bills hope. (Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images) \nThe Buffalo Bills have gone through many iterations in the past couple of decades, 20 years spent flailing in the wilderness. They have shuffled general managers, swapped coaches and even ownership changed. As the Bills have failed to win even one playoff game, they have been rudderless. \nThat quality, the one constant that soiled the franchise, may finally be changing. The Bills are 3-1 after four games, and they have shown signs their first quarter-season is more than a fluke. More importantly, they might actually have people in charge who know what they\u2019re doing. The present isn\u2019t so bad, and the future is bright in, of all places, Buffalo. \nCoach Sean McDermott and General Manager Brandon Beane inherited a mess this offseason. They cleaned house, trading some of Buffalo\u2019s best players \u2014 cornerback Ronald Darby, wide receiver Sammy Watkins and linebacker Reggie Ragland \u2014 and acquiring a haul of draft picks. The Bills have six picks in the first three rounds in next year\u2019s draft. [ NFL Power Rankings \u2014 Week 4: Chiefs leave no doubt in remaining No. 1 ] \nWhen McDermott and Beane launched a rebuild, they may not have expected to be in first place in the AFC East, a game ahead of the Patriots, after Week 4. On Sunday, they scored one of the most impressive victories of the young season, stealing a victory in Atlanta. \nThere is plenty of season left for the Bills\u2019 expected lack of talent to catch up to them. There are also indicators that they\u2019re a playoff contender. The Bills lead the NFL in points allowed, having yielded 13.5 per game. Their opponents are 8-2 in games played against teams other than the Bills. \nAfter Mary Levy retired in 1997, the Bills cycled through seven head coaches in the next 20 seasons, not including two interims. The list: Wade Phillips, Gregg Williams, Mike Mularkey, Dick Jauron, Chan Gailey, Doug Marrone and Rex Ryan. Only Phillips reached the playoffs or accumulated a winning record in Buffalo. \nMcDermott, the former Carolina Panthers defensive coordinator who served apprenticeships under Andy Reid and Ron Rivera, might be different. Already, he has earned the trust and respect of the locker room. Players have responded to McDermott\u2019s disciplined, detailed approach, crediting his preparation with their surprising start, especially in comparison to Ryan. \n\u201cI will say that the things coach preaches throughout the week, the way he keeps his focus and the way he allows us to practice certain situations in games [have changed],\u201d quarterback Tyrod Taylor said. \u201cOver the past three weeks, we have practiced a number of situations. Ironically, they have happened in the games. We are prepared for it. The coaches are doing a great job of keeping us prepared for games.\u201d [ What\u2019s the end game for NFL and protesting players? Right now, there isn\u2019t an answer. ] \n\u201cWe practice these situations a lot more than we have in the past,\u201d Bills defensive tackle Jerel Worthy said, per Advance Media New York . \u201cWhen we get out there, it feels a little bit more comfortable than it did in the past. To be honest with this team, we attribute our success to preparation. I think we prepare a lot differently. Coach McDermott keeps us on our toes in team meetings. He\u2019ll call you out in team meetings and ask a random question about the offense. You have to know the situation and know what the offense is thinking. He just tries to make the game a little slower for us.\u201d \nWhen the Bills beat the Falcons, a reporter asked McDermott whether it might be Buffalo\u2019s biggest road win since their AFC championship years. McDermott kindly suggested he \u201chold your horses.\u201d The fact the question even got asked showed where the Bills have been. McDermott, a coach who has brought substance after the bluster of recent seasons, shows where they may be going. \n>>> Derek Carr has a spinal fracture and will miss two to six weeks , as Carl Steward reports . The Raiders will turn to former Bills starter EJ Manuel, who looked capable filling in Sunday in Denver. The Raiders\u2019 bye is Week 10, and so they could give Carr a full six weeks by waiting until Week 11. Their opponents in that pivotal stretch: Ravens, Chargers, Chiefs, at Buffalo and at Miami. Their Week 7 game against Kansas City is a Thursday game, so it\u2019s hard to see Carr coming back before missing at least three games. \nBottom line: The Raiders were seen as a Super Bowl contender entering the season, and now they\u2019re in a battle to reach the playoffs. [ Bears to start Mitchell Trubisky after another poor performance by Mike Glennon ] \n>>> It\u2019s Mitchell Trubisky time in Chicago , Rich Campbell writes . It\u2019s not clear how the entire organization feels about the benching of Mike Glennon. From Campbell\u2019s story: \nGeneral manager Ryan Pace initially planned for the team to patiently develop Trubisky in practices. This deviation was triggered by Glennon\u2019s failure to consistently protect the ball during the Bears\u2019 1-3 start. He has been credited with an NFL-high eight turnovers, all in the last three games, including blowout road losses to the Buccaneers and Packers. \n\u201cIt was just a decision I thought needed to be made,\u201d coach John Fox said Monday evening on WBBM radio. \u201cWe\u2019ve had 10 giveaways in the first four weeks of the season, and you can\u2019t win football games that way. Not that they were all one guy\u2019s fault, but the combination of that, we\u2019re going a different direction.\u201d \nFox, who was not available Monday to reporters who cover the team, said the decisive discussion with Pace about the quarterback situation was part of an ongoing evaluation of Glennon\u2019s play and Trubisky\u2019s growth. \n\u201cI think everybody was in agreement,\u201d Fox said. Pace has not commented publicly. \n>> Cliff Avril is going to be \u201ca while,\u201d as Ian Rapoport reports . The Seahawks are going to miss Avril dearly. Last year, he was seventh in the NFL with 11.5 sacks and fourth with five forced fumbles. Seattle has a major test at the Rams this weekend. \n>> Seattle offensive lineman Rees Odhiambo suffered a bruised heart Sunday night and had to be tended to in the Seahawks\u2019 locker room.

Got it By Associated Press By Associated Press October 3 at 7:48 AM \nBAGHDAD \u2014 An Iraqi lawmaker says his Kurdish colleagues are not attending a parliament session underway in Baghdad as tensions escalate further between the central government and Iraq\u2019s Kurdish region following its controversial independence referendum. \nMohammed al-Karbouli says the Kurdish lawmakers did not show up for Tuesday\u2019s session. \nThe Shiite-dominated legislature rejected the Sept. 25 referendum in Iraq\u2019s autonomous Kurdish region and areas the Kurds captured battling the Islamic State group since 2014. The Kurds voted by more than 90 percent in support of independence. \nParliament has asked for harsh measures in response to the vote, including sending federal troops to retake the contested oil-rich city of Kirkuk, which is held by Kurdish forces but claimed by Baghdad. Lawmakers also dismissed the ethnically mixed Kirkuk province\u2019s Kurdish governor who supported the referendum. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The catastrophe in Yemen may test whether Congress is finally prepared to exercise its constitutional responsibility. Four legislators \u2014 two House Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 have introduced a resolution under the War Powers Act demanding a vote in 15 days to end U.S. involvement in Saudi Arabia\u2019s devastation of Yemen.\nThe resolution, co-sponsored by Democrats Ro Khanna and Mark Pocan (the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus) and by Republicans Thomas Massie and Walter Jones, requires the \u201cremoval\u201d of U.S. forces from the war in Yemen unless Congress votes to authorize American involvement. Beginning under President Barack Obama, the U.S. military has assisted the Saudi campaign in Yemen, providing tankers for aerial refueling and targeting intelligence against the Houthi rebels said to be backed by Iran. U.S. support was reportedly part of a deal to get Saudi Arabia to be more supportive of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\nThe Saudi-led campaign in Yemen has been central to creating what U.N. officials call the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis. The carpet-bombing of civilian areas has helped produce borderline famine for 7 million , 20 million in need of humanitarian aid and a spreading cholera epidemic that has already reached 700,000 cases and killed more than 2,000 . \nSaudi Arabia has faced growing global protests over the bombing of civilian areas and other alleged violations of international law. Most recently, the Saudis have barred relief flights from access to Yemen\u2019s airport and blocked delivery of four cranes financed by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that are vital to unloading medicine and food at Port Hodeida. Saudi influence managed to quash efforts by the Netherlands to force an international inspection of war crimes two years ago. Finally last month, the U.N. Human Rights Council passed a compromise resolution calling for the appointment of independent international experts to investigate humanitarian abuses and identify those responsible.\nDuring his campaign, Donald Trump expressed skepticism of failed U.S. interventions across the Middle East. Since coming to office, however, he has ratcheted up U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen. The pace of U.S. bombing and interventions by special forces aimed at al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has increased dramatically. Trump made no mention of Saudi Arabia\u2019s brutal attacks on Yemen in celebrating its cooperation in the war on terrorism at the Arab Islamic American Summit in Riyadh. In spite of generally opposing all things Obama, Trump appears to be doubling down on his predecessor\u2019s policy toward Saudi Arabia and Yemen.\nAlthough a reactionary monarchy, Saudi Arabia has long enjoyed a special relationship with the United States. A blind eye has been turned toward its support for spreading extreme fundamentalist Wahhabi doctrine and its extensive financial ties to extremist organizations. The fact that the 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudi citizens has been virtually ignored. A document on Saudi connections to the attackers (from a larger congressional inquiry into the attacks) was released only last year. \nNow that impunity is starting to wear thin. In his foreign policy speech at Westminster College, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) courageously called out our support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u201cdestructive intervention in Yemen,\u201d arguing that \u201csuch policies dramatically undermine America\u2019s ability to advance a human rights agenda across the world.\u201d \nLater, in an interview with the Intercept\u2019s Mehdi Hasan, Sanders elaborated , arguing that Saudi Arabia shouldn\u2019t be considered \u201can ally,\u201d because \u201cit is an undemocratic country that has supported terrorism across the world.\u201d \nThe congressional resolution cites the State Department 2016 Country Reports on Terrorism\u2019s conclusion that the Yemen conflict is \u201ccounterproductive to ongoing efforts . . . to pursue Al Qaeda and its associated forces.\u201d The Saudi intervention is creating yet another failed state in which terrorists can take root.\nAs lead co-sponsor Khanna (D-Calif.) argues , the war powers resolution is long overdue: \u201cCongress and the American people know too little about the role we are playing in a war that is causing suffering for millions of people and is a genuine threat to our national security.\u201d \nThe resolution will force Congress to debate this truly deplorable policy that has implicated the United States in Saudi war crimes while fueling the spread of terrorism. The establishment default about the endless wars without victory or sense in the Middle East must end. Indeed, the bipartisan nature of the co-sponsor list for the resolution indicates interest on both sides of the aisle in revitalizing Congress as an effective constitutional check on a long-out-of-control executive branch. Khanna is hopeful that the debate on our support of the Saudi coalition in Yemen will serve as a belated but necessary first step, demonstrating growing bipartisan concern about continued foreign intervention. \n\nRead more from Katrina vanden Heuvel\u2019s archive or follow her on Twitter . \nRead more here: \nJackson Diehl: How Trump is enabling famine \nThe Post\u2019s View: Our bloody alliance with Saudi Arabia \nDavid Ignatius: The lesson from Yemen", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernie sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark pocan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walter jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heuvel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas massie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khanna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mehdi hasan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "washington post congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "aqap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.n. human rights council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. agency for international development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usaid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westminster college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al qaeda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houthi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congressional progressive caucus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.n.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arabian peninsula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riyadh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "port hodeida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:34:56.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50d039cf250f796fc9d983b566e1e95a6c5ab221", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgSs41MzF1mUjcRf1PrWljGsgRJOjdRlWO72ekJaci4PSu4yagUsMDoNPTN1BPxweW7v7FtA14qhflNTna0Koop.G6E3ST5uTqNI5RiW..7qjZtCtOGHwOjdHr82k8aHRUfYYAGJFXLWgU2lMsFzXArdRlPyDDPWsiC8k2OJ45YPN_aSoK3XQ7yCzEjomOrUw.D3Z5Xa7kaLCKkz7Kma8hP6fpkjdJYOoc", "site_full": "www.washingtonpost.com", "site": "washingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://news.google.com/news?cf=all&ned=us&hl=en&output=rss", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "Top Stories - Google News", "title": "Supreme Court takes up Wisconsin as first test in partisan gerrymandering claims - Washington Post", "title_full": "Supreme Court takes up Wisconsin as first test in partisan gerrymandering claims - Washington Post", "published": "2017-10-03T15:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/10/01/National-Politics/Images/COURT133.JPG?t=20170517", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 177, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5595, "comments": 0, "shares": 5595}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 13}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "50d039cf250f796fc9d983b566e1e95a6c5ab221", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgSs41MzF1mUjcRf1PrWljGsgRJOjdRlWO72ekJaci4PSu4yagUsMDoNPTN1BPxweW7v7FtA14qhflNTna0Koop.G6E3ST5uTqNI5RiW..7qjZtCtOGHwOjdHr82k8aHRUfYYAGJFXLWgU2lMsFzXArdRlPyDDPWsiC8k2OJ45YPN_aSoK3XQ7yCzEjomOrUw.D3Z5Xa7kaLCKkz7Kma8hP6fpkjdJYOoc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Supreme Court takes up Wisconsin as first test in partisan gerrymandering claims - Washington Post", "text": "October 3 at 11:50 AM Follow @scotusreporter Opponents of political gerrymandering had reason for optimism at the Supreme Court on Tuesday, with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the likely swing vote, appearing more in sync with liberal colleagues who seemed convinced that a legislative map can be so infected with political bias that it violates the Constitution.\nBut it\u2019s what Kennedy didn\u2019t say that could determine whether the court, for the first time, strikes down a legislative map because of extreme partisan gerrymandering. While he has previously expressed concerns about the political mapmaking practice, he has yet to endorse a way of determining when gerrymandering is excessive, and Kennedy give no sign at oral arguments Tuesday that he had found one.\nIn a case from Wisconsin that could reshape the way American elections are conducted, the Supreme Court heard from challengers that it was the \u201conly institution in the United States\u201d that could prevent a coming wave of extreme partisan gerrymandering that would distort the basic structure of democracy.\n\u201cPoliticians are never going to fix gerrymandering,\u201d said Paul M. Smith, representing Democratic voters who challenged a 2011 redistricting plan drawn by Wisconsin\u2019s ruling Republicans. \u201cThey like gerrymandering.\u201d\nEven conservative justices skeptical of Smith\u2019s argument seemed to agree that it was unsavory for members of the party in power to draw legislative districts to protect themselves and their own, and make it hard for opponents to ever gain power.\nHere\u2019s how the Supreme Court could decide whether your vote will count View Graphic Here\u2019s how the Supreme Court could decide whether your vote will count \u201cGerrymandering is distasteful,\u201d said Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. \u201cBut if we are going to impose a standard on the courts, it has to be something that\u2019s manageable.\u201d\nFinding a test that courts could use to determine when political favoritism had become too great \u2014 the \u201cRosetta Stone,\u201d Alito called it \u2014 has always been the hurdle. Kennedy said as much the last time the court examined the issue, in 2004.\nIf anything, Kennedy seemed more convinced this time around that the courts have a role in finding that partisan gerrymandering can be so extreme as to be unconstitutional.\nHe pressed lawyers for the state and its legislative leaders about whether it would be unconstitutional for a state to undertake the redistricting process by forthrightly saying it intended to favor one party over another.\nErin Murphy, representing the legislative leaders, hesitated and said that was not the case in Wisconsin.\nKennedy was undeterred. \u201cI\u2019d like the answer to the question,\u201d he said.\nMurphy and the state\u2019s lawyer, Solicitor General Misha Tseytlin, agreed that would be unconstitutional.\nKennedy did not ask any questions of Smith. And the tone of the oral arguments indicated Kennedy seemed to be agreeing more with liberal justices who felt courts must police gerrymandering than conservative justices who were wary of getting involved.\nBut he also stopped short of indicating that he believed Wisconsin\u2019s plan was so flawed it should be overturned, or that the challengers had come up with the elusive tests he had said were necessary in his 2004 opinion.\nA panel of three federal judges ruled 2 to 1 that Wisconsin\u2019s leaders went too far in using a secretive process for drawing the maps after the 2010 Census.\nThe lower court concluded that the districting plans were drawn to eliminate swing districts and create ones favorable to Republicans. That court found that the shape of the districts could not be explained by nonpartisan reasons and that the advantage given to Republicans would be \u201cenduring\u201d through the decade even if Democrats outperformed Republicans at the polls.\nThe judges said Republicans packed Democrats into some districts and spread them out across others as a way to create more districts conducive to a GOP candidate.\nThe plans, developed in 2011 by Republican leaders who controlled the legislature and signed by Gov. Scott Walker (R), were effective.\nIn the election held after the new district maps were adopted, Republican candidates won 48.6\u2009percent of the statewide vote but captured a 60-to-39 seat advantage in the State Assembly.\nIf the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t rule that such a plan is unconstitutional, Smith told the court, \u201cin 2020, you\u2019re going to have a festival of copycat gerrymandering the likes of which this country has never seen.\u201d States are required to redraw legislative and congressional districts after every decade\u2019s census.\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. pushed back. He said Smith was asking the courts to effectively take over the process of redistricting from elected officials. He said the tests to gauge gerrymandering offered by the challengers were based on mathematical tests and political-science theories, which he characterized as \u201csociological gobbledygook.\u201d\nEvery redistricting plan will be contested, Roberts said. \u201cWe will have to decide in every case whether the Democrats win or the Republicans win.\u201d\nThe court can attempt to explain the complicated tests used in making such a determination, he said, but \u201cthe intelligent man on the street is going to say that\u2019s a bunch of baloney.\u201d\nBut liberal Justice Stephen G. Breyer did not think the court\u2019s task would be so hard.\nFor one thing, only maps produced in states where one party controlled the process could be accused of excessive partisanship, he said.\nHe suggested the test could be as simple as this: If one party wins only a minority of the statewide vote but still gains a majority of legislative seats, does the same possibility exist for the other party?\nThe plans developed by Wisconsin Republicans showed that they could hang on to the majority of seats with less than 50 percent of the statewide vote, but that Democrats would need more than 53 percent of the vote to win a majority.\nWhen Alito and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch worried about courts having to apply conjecture to evaluate a state\u2019s plan, Justice Elena Kagan said the expanding world of technology had made it routine to create maps and evaluate their performance.\n\u201cI was under the impression that legislators are capable of doing this actually pretty easily now,\u201d she said.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor noted that the Wisconsin mapmakers drew and rejected maps until they came up with one that maximized Republican chances, and then it succeeded beyond their expectations.\nShe and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also asked more-fundamental questions.\n\u201cCould you tell me what the value is to democracy from political gerrymandering?\u201d Sotomayor asked Murphy.\nMurphy said that even Breyer had noted in a previous case that such districting gives constituents a way to know the legislature and whom to hold accountable. \u201cIt produces values in terms of accountability that are valuable so that the people understand who isn\u2019t and who is in power,\u201d Murphy replied.\nSotomayor countered: \u201cI really don\u2019t understand\u201d how that makes it \u201cokay to stack the decks.\u201d\nGinsburg, too, had the big picture in mind.\n\u201cIf you can stack a legislature in this way, what incentive is there for a voter to exercise his vote?\u201d Ginsburg asked. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a Democratic district or a Republican district . . . the result is preordained in most of the districts.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cWhat becomes of the precious right to vote?\u201d\nThe case is Gill v.

He traditionally addresses the nation during the Christmas holidays \u2014 not during political crises. Felipe\u2019s address reminded some of his father\u2019s appearance when he faced down the 1981 coup attempt.\nHis words are likely to bolster the central government\u2019s case that the Catalan separatists have gone too far \u2014 and may signal new get-tough measures by Madrid against the Barcelona rebellion.\nAs the king addressed the nation, trade unions in Catalonia led a powerful general strike Tuesday that shut down businesses, highways and schools in a mass protest against police violence during the region\u2019s chaotic independence vote.\nHuge crowds poured through the streets of Barcelona and other cities in the region in the latest act of defiance against the central government and its rejection of Sunday\u2019s referendum, in which more than 2 million people voted in support of Catalonia\u2019s bid for nationhood.\nDemonstrators said they were appalled by images of officers of Spain\u2019s national police and civil guard, sent to shut down the referendum, beating voters with rubber batons and dragging them away from ballot boxes.\nOn the streets Tuesday, the marchers chanted, \u201cOccupying forces get out!\u201d \nThe raw emotions \u2014 and the stark divisions between the separatists and those who want to keep Spain united \u2014 are only growing.\nPaula Miranda, a university student, said, \u201cI felt lots of impotence and rage.

Others were guided by leftist theater troupes and union longshoremen from the Port of Barcelona. There were anarchists and families with children in strollers. Some demonstrators covered themselves in makeup that mimicked ashes. The demonstrations were peaceful, by turns somber and festive.\nA woman holds a Spanish flag to support Spanish police as pro-independence protesters gather in front of the national police headquarters in Barcelona on Oct. 3, 2017. (Francisco Seco/AP) While the secessionists in Catalonia kept up the pressure by stoking anger over alleged police brutality, the central government in Madrid continued to defend its actions and reminded the world that the Spanish courts had ruled the Catalan referendum illegal.\nSpanish leaders offered broad support for the police and condemned the Catalan government as rebels who have broken with the constitution and muffled the voices of the many here who oppose independence.\nPrime Minister Mariano Rajoy said, \u201cI want to express my total support for the security forces, who are defending legality and the rights of everyone in Catalonia.\u201d\nSpanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido tweeted, \u201cWe will not accept the incitement of hatred toward the police and Civil Guard.\u201d \nCarles Puigdemont, the regional president and a leading secessionist, said Sunday that Catalonia had won \u201cthe right to independence,\u201d and Monday he called on European leaders to support the cause.\nBut Spain\u2019s European affairs minister, Jorge Toledo, told Politico that the crisis was a Spanish internal matter and that any future discussions must be between the central and regional governments.\n\u201cYou can change the law, you can oppose it, but you cannot disobey it,\u201d Toledo said.\nAccording to the Catalan government, which announced the referendum results early Monday, 90 percent of the voters chose independence. More than 2 million people voted yes, while fewer than 177,000 voted no, the regional government said.\nThe turnout for the referendum was 42 percent, Catalan authorities said.\nMany Catalans who were against declaring an independent state did not vote, some saying they felt intimidated.\nSome of that intimidation was visible as the general strike began Tuesday morning, with groups of young people marching in the neighborhoods, shutting down intersections, heckling taxis and blocking tourist buses, warning the drivers against breaking the general strike.\nMost shops and cafes had pulled their metal shutters down. Those small businesses that remained open faced crowds that banged on their doors or spray-painted their shop windows with slogans.\nSeveral activists surrounded a deliveryman with a handcart loaded with milk cartons. He told them in tough Spanish \u2014 not in the region\u2019s Catalan language \u2014 that he could not care less about their strike and that they should get out of his way, or else.\nWhen marchers tried to force a pharmacy to close its doors, Gregorio Pe\u00f1a, a retired banker, came to the pharmacy workers\u2019 aid.\n\u201cLeave them alone!\u201d he shouted.\nPe\u00f1a, who opposed Sunday\u2019s referendum, said he thought Catalans were being manipulated \u2014 \u201cbrainwashed\u201d \u2014 by hardcore secessionists.\nSurveys taken in the months before Sunday\u2019s referendum show Catalans roughly divided between those who wanted an independent republic and those who wanted to remain in Spain.\n\u201cWhat we are seeing now is the part of Catalonia that controls the government, with a minority government, which in a best-case scenario never got more than 46 percent of the vote, trying to change the rules and impose on the other part of Catalonia and on the whole of the country a revolution,\u201d said Catalan lawyer Ignasi Guardans, a former member of the European Parliament.\nThe Catalan filmmaker Isabel Coixet said pro-independence authorities have muffled debate.\n\u201cWe are completely silenced,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have created a climate of tension in which anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with them doesn\u2019t exist and is discredited. And, honestly, there are so many people keeping quiet.

The percentage of black and Hispanic households worth more than $1 million has remained around or below 2 percent since 1992. \n\u201cWe have growing wealth disparities among whites as well, but the white group is so much further ahead that the class of elite blacks is nowhere near the class of elite whites,\u201d said Darrick Hamilton, an economist at the New School in New York. \nThe accumulation of white wealth looks set to continue. The average white household, worth about $930,000 in 2016, will accumulate a net worth of more than $1 million by the time the next triennial survey comes out in 2020, Hamilton said. (The reported average is skewed by wealthy outliers. The median white household was worth $171,000 in 2016.) \nWhite families vastly outperform African Americans and Hispanics in several key indicators of wealth: homeownership and equity, investments, and inheritance. [ White families have nearly 10 times the net worth of black families. And the gap is growing. ] \nMuch of the growth in white wealth during the past two decades comes from the doubling of financial assets, including stocks and bonds, as well as pensions and retirement accounts, according to a Washington Post analysis of Fed data. Equity in their primary residences as well as equity in nonfinancial assets such as second homes and other real estate, boats, cars and jewels grew as well, but not as significantly. \nWhite families are twice as likely as black and Hispanic families to own stocks or mutual funds. Sixty percent of white families invest in the stock market, while less than one-third of black and Hispanic families have any exposure to the stock market, according to Fed data. \nAmong American households invested in the market, the median value of white-owned investments rose to $50,000 in 2016, indicating a recovery from the Great Recession. The median value of black-owned and Hispanic-owned investments also rose but remained below 2007 values, at about $12,000. All numbers have been adjusted for inflation. [ White people are really confident that things are getting better for black people ] \nWhen it comes to homeownership, often the largest component of wealth for American families, nearly three-quarters of white families own their homes, compared with less than half of black and Hispanic families. \nEven among homeowners, minority-owned homes had lower values, in part because of racist practices such as redlining that prohibited them from buying residences in many white neighborhoods. \n\u201cIf you are a black homeowner, you are more likely to have a lower value on your home because of neighborhood segregation,\u201d said Valerie Wilson, director of the Economic Policy Institute\u2019s program on race, ethnicity, and the economy. \u201cBlacks couldn\u2019t purchase in white communities where values were rising faster.\u201d \nThe average housing wealth for white families was more than twice that of black and Hispanic families in 2016. \nWhite families are more likely to trade up to pricier homes over time, whereas black families are more likely to lose their homes or stay in the same house for a lifetime, said Brendan O\u2019Flaherty, a Columbia University economist who studies the economics of race. \n\u201cThe idea of a starter house is predominantly a white phenomenon,\u201d O\u2019Flaherty said. \nBlack and Hispanic families are also much less likely to inherit wealth than their white counterparts. One-quarter of white households reported receiving an inheritance, compared with 8 percent of blacks and 5 percent of Hispanics. \nThe Republican tax plan, released last week, could further widen the country\u2019s gaping economic divide, delivering major gains for the richest 1 percent of Americans , according to an analysis by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a leading group of nonpartisan experts. \n\u201cThe racial disparities in wealth, which is the paramount indicator of economic opportunity, security and overall well being, remain stark,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cAnd if the Trump tax plan, which includes the elimination of the estate tax, is made into law, it will only get even larger.\u201d \nTed Mellnik contributed to this report.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "darrick hamilton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o\u2019flaherty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brendan o\u2019flaherty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamilton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ted mellnik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valerie wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tracy jan by tracy jan october", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wonkblog analysis analysis interpretation", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "urban-brookings tax policy center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "economic policy institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:57:26.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb087ca7e76c5e8277403cfb7666c3a73a5f231a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgW0izAs9LRh89ycS1qOg5oosAbFaqg3eidS0DzK0BIjyzy5TZ7uc9L7_3jXi2EkHqHsI4L7TgRC11dp9cHX7m_02wQscCT1pC58Nm77nOyPh0LpsLodxi5Am0Bo.KLOv1", "site_full": "www.washingtonpost.com", "site": "washingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/rss/rss_wonkblog", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "Wonkblog", "title": "Good news: Fewer and fewer young people are getting incarcerated", "title_full": "Good news: Fewer and fewer young people are getting incarcerated", "published": "2017-10-03T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2017/10/Youth-Incarceration-Rates.jpg&amp;w=1484&amp;op=resize&amp;opt=1&amp;filter=antialias&amp;t=20170517", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 177, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 943, "comments": 0, "shares": 943}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 27}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb087ca7e76c5e8277403cfb7666c3a73a5f231a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgW0izAs9LRh89ycS1qOg5oosAbFaqg3eidS0DzK0BIjyzy5TZ7uc9L7_3jXi2EkHqHsI4L7TgRC11dp9cHX7m_02wQscCT1pC58Nm77nOyPh0LpsLodxi5Am0Bo.KLOv1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Keith Humphreys", "published": "2017-10-03T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Good news: Fewer and fewer young people are getting incarcerated", "text": "By Keith Humphreys By Keith Humphreys October 3 \nThe incarceration rate for juvenile offenders has fallen to the lowest level since the federal government began tracking it in 1997, a change brought on by a combination of falling crime rates and forward-thinking criminal justice reforms. \nOver the past generation, there has been a 60 percent drop in the rate at which juvenile offenders whose cases have been adjudicated are confined to residential facilities in the juvenile justice system. Whereas about 1 in 400 youths were committed to juvenile justice facilities in 1997, only 1 in 1,000 were in 2015. The change has been remarkably widespread: The commitment rate dropped in 48 of the 50 states. \nAs crime has decreased over the past 20 years, arrest rates have dropped by a third , with the largest drop being among the young. This naturally translates into fewer juveniles being committed to correctional facilities. \nBut the juvenile justice system hasn\u2019t been merely a windsock benefiting passively from falling crime. In state after state , lawmakers have increasingly focused confinement on violent and chronic juvenile offenders. This reduces confinement directly in the short term and may have an even more important effect over time. \nAdolescents who commit criminal or antisocial acts are \u2014 like most adolescents \u2014 influenced heavily by their peers. Accumulating research shows that adolescents who engage in antisocial behavior often escalate when they have regular contact with other troubled adolescents, even when the contact is intended to be therapeutic. Putting a chronically truant teenager into a residential facility with young people convicted of assault and burglary, for example, can make it more, rather than less, likely that the teenager will reoffend. \nAs states divert young people who commit less serious offenses from confinement and into alternative supervision and service programs in the community, they reduce the risks that such individuals will become hardened criminals as they grow up . This is particularly true for those states that are wise enough to reinvest some of the savings from reduced incarceration into rehabilitative community services for delinquent youths. \nJake Horowitz of the Pew Charitable Trusts, which works closely with states on juvenile justice reform legislation, describes the changes of recent years as reflecting a confluence of evidence, policy and politics. \u201cState leaders from both sides of the aisle are following the research and public opinion to craft policy solutions that achieve more public safety with less correctional control,\u201d he said. Juvenile justice reform can thus be deservedly celebrated as a bipartisan achievement that benefited both troubled young people and the general public.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:57:28.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "663af22374bdc0e3a4c0fb817f187365863ae6aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgW0izAs9LRh_ZBSEwRyEDceY8n4eKfxYVX6o4.uWy4G.6qrjxdOXkjw1cXoOyC2WhwlA8MgsFNUo44iibbiY5pU2j4C19sCpultdxsRgkeWy7UnKWzNK2iS5OW.27VfYC", "site_full": "www.washingtonpost.com", "site": "washingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/rss/rss_soloish", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "Solo-ish", "title": "I don\u2019t drink.

And guess what? I still have great first dates.", "text": "October 3 Follow @SeamusKirst\n(iStock) When the gods of love provide, and I am setting up a first date, I take a simple approach: I name a date, time and coffee shop or bar.\nThen, I always slip in one last simple sentence: \u201cBy the way, I don\u2019t drink.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a statement that shouldn\u2019t be a big deal. But I have learned that it can be.\nSometimes, these first dates will ask why I abstain. I tell them honestly: I\u2019m a recovering alcoholic. In my online dating profiles, I always include that I\u2019m the author of \u201c Shitfaced: Musings of a Former Drunk \u201d; that has seemed to decrease the need to explain.\nIn a city like New York, where first dates are usually held over drinks, and initial acts of intimacy are often accompanied by a light buzz, dating as a young sober person has proven to be incredibly confusing.\nStill, I am able to form sentences on a date without wine, and sex does still work without tequila.\nWhen I first got sober four years ago, I felt the need to \u201cmake up for\u201d the fact that I wouldn\u2019t be drinking by planning overly ambitious dates. I would scour the city for an experimental play, or suggest we go on adventures hours away in the Hudson Valley; I was determined to try to find activities that showed this stranger that I was still interesting without alcohol. Then, when trying to plan a first date involving a trapeze, I had a realization: I didn\u2019t need to replicate a rom-com plot, just because I didn\u2019t drink. Plus, a trapeze class, long train ride or walk through the woods with a bad first date is still uncomfortable, whether or not you\u2019re drinking.\nSo I like to have my first dates over coffee, or even at a bar. (Though I recognize that the latter is not a healthy situation for every recovering alcoholic.) These types of dates are casual and \u2014 call me lazy! \u2014 ideal in that they involve little planning. Unlike a full dinner, going for a hike, or seeing a play, if the date is awful, it\u2019s easy to get out of there fast. If you and your date hit it off, you can move on to dinner or just keep talking all night.\nIt is easier for everyone involved if I let my suitor know that I don\u2019t drink before we get to the date, instead of letting them know when they give me that look of panicked confusion after they order a gin and tonic and I order a Diet Coke. (Or a tea if I\u2019m feeling wild!)\nSure, I don\u2019t need to tell this person I just met that I\u2019m refraining because I\u2019m an alcoholic. But I realized after many failed dates, much introspection and countless therapy sessions, that my delaying telling dates I was an alcoholic in recovery was coming from a place of shame. It was coming from my insecurity that I\u2019m less desirable as a romantic partner because I am not able to drink.\nBy telling the person before the date that I don\u2019t drink, they then have more time to process it, and thoughtfully decide whether they feel comfortable drinking even if I am not.\nThere are many sober people who only want to date other sober people. They might feel that this will reduce relapse triggers for them, or that the other person will better understand the experience, or that they\u2019ll just have more in common. Though I am open to dating sober and non-sober individuals, I certainly understand that inclination.\nEspecially when I get bizarre reactions from a date.\nThere was one guy who was visibly agitated that I wouldn\u2019t drink, and another man who seemed dumbfounded that I could be physically intimate while sober. There was the date that wanted to hear my drinking horror stories, then seemed to drink for both of us.\nYet the most recurring issue has been when people assume that my not drinking means that I am somehow judging them for drinking. Sure, as a recovering alcoholic, I don\u2019t want to date someone who makes me feel like I\u2019m making out with a bottle of Jack Daniels. But I have been on plenty of dates where the other person has had a drink or two, I have had zero \u2014 and neither of us seemed to notice.\nIn the beginning of sobriety, those odd reactions bothered me. Now I know they are a reflection on the other person, not me. Four years into sobriety, I have developed a simple rule: If someone has any reaction to my sobriety that isn\u2019t immediately \u2018good for you,\u2019 I know we are not going to work out.\nREAD MORE:\nI\u2019m not going to marry myself. But I understand the appeal.\nIt\u2019s tempting to dump your grievances during a breakup. Don\u2019t do it.\nAre you having an emotional affair?

We completely understand the confusion created and accept full responsibility for the poorly written reason for denial.\nFirst of all, there are NO current issues of Workers World on the DOC Denied Publication list. Inmates have received Workers World in the past and continue to do so. The letter to which you refer was a denial from one State Correctional Institution to ONE inmate. It was a first level denial. Pursuant to our policy, DC-ADM 803, we must provide notice to publishers at the first level of appeal. The letter at issue was to provide the publisher with notice of a denial and the opportunity to appeal. No publications are placed on a statewide ban without review by the Policy Office. This particular issue has not been reviewed yet.\nThe reason for the denial was grossly inaccurate. The Department of Corrections does NOT tolerate racism in any form and supports policies of equality. The denial was based on language in an article about White Supremacy that was interpreted as a literal call to violence rather than an ideological statement.\nWe will review the entire issue and make a determination whether the denial should be overturned to the inmate to whom it was denied. Again, the reason had nothing to do with white supremacy other than what was interpreted as a call for a potential violent act.\nPlease let us know if you have any questions.\nPrisoners\u2019 free speech rights \u2014 including their rights to receive information \u2014 are much more limited than the rights of those outside prisons, but they aren\u2019t completely lost; and certainly a viewpoint-based ban on speech because it opposes white supremacy would be unconstitutional. But banning material that calls for violence (even in ways that would be constitutionally protected outside prison under Brandenburg v. Ohio ), or that otherwise undermines prison security, is permissible. If the Department response is right that the original letter mischaracterized the situation, and it was the \u201cjoin the fight\u201d part (with the fight referring to violence) that triggered the prohibition and not the \u201cagainst white supremacy\u201d part, that should be constitutional.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eugene volokh", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "arne langstmo", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pennsylvania department of corrections", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "workers world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of corrections", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "policy office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pa.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandenburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:07:56.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "49dfaf633ee45ded3ea3263a7c3197e3ecc59f0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgW0izAs9LRh9KQL78nu5z5MokMyonqcz4j4Ls.UMnDXfm4MBOpzkEpVutrHtmTitKmEk9kXBgtv4fXLScIF4eNzFS7CWVnAcL.dRxKO_uVuouMDqrcqUH_ueeb1zjhRQO", "site_full": "www.washingtonpost.com", "site": "washingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/feed/", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "WorldViews", "title": "Venezuela has too much money but not nearly enough cash", "title_full": "Venezuela has too much money but not nearly enough cash", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/12/02/Editorial-Opinion/Images/AFP_IN85Q-2009.jpg?t=20170517", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 177, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 85, "comments": 0, "shares": 85}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 56}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "49dfaf633ee45ded3ea3263a7c3197e3ecc59f0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgW0izAs9LRh9KQL78nu5z5MokMyonqcz4j4Ls.UMnDXfm4MBOpzkEpVutrHtmTitKmEk9kXBgtv4fXLScIF4eNzFS7CWVnAcL.dRxKO_uVuouMDqrcqUH_ueeb1zjhRQO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mariana Zu\u00f1iga", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Venezuela has too much money but not nearly enough cash", "text": "Venezuela has too much money but not nearly enough cash The inside track on Washington politics.

Got it By Mariana Zu\u00f1iga By Mariana Zu\u00f1iga October 3 People wait to withdraw money from an ATM in Caracas, Venezuela, on Dec. 1, 2016. (Federico Parra/AFP/Getty Images) \nCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Eugenio Escobar is waiting outside an ATM in Caracas hoping to get some cash. His car has been stuck for hours in a parking lot, and he needs 2,000 bolivares in cash to pay the parking fee. But he, like many Venezuelans these days, doesn\u2019t have a single note inside his wallet. \n\u201cI\u2019ve visited at least five ATMs today,\u201d the 73-year-old pensioner said. \u201cAll of them were empty.\u201d \nVenezuela's extreme cash shortage is creating serious problems in the daily lives of its citizens. To find cash, people have to wander for days from ATM to ATM, and queues are growing longer every day. On average, Venezuelans can only withdraw 10,000 to 20,000 bolivares a day, equivalent to just $3 to $6 dollars at black-market exchange rates. A cheap meal in Caracas currently costs about 30,000 bolivares, so simply paying for daily food intake can require carrying a backpack full of bills. \nThis is not the first time Venezuela has endured a lack of cash. Less than a year ago, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro removed the country's biggest bank note, the 100-bolivar note, from circulation, claiming that \u201c international mafias \u201d were trying to harm his socialist government by hoarding the bills and sending them over the border into Colombia. \nThe official narrative hasn\u2019t changed much since then. In a recent statement, Venezuela's regulatory agency for banks, called Sudeban, blamed the mafias for the scarcity of cash, claiming that some 30 percent of Venezuelan bank notes are diverted toward the border by currency traders. Meanwhile, the 100-bolivar notes were supposed to become invalid in December, but they have remained in circulation, and the production of new, higher-value bills has taken longer than expected. \nBut economists say the real reason for the cash shortage is probably Venezuela\u2019s runaway inflation , which the International Monetary Fund expects will reach 720 percent by the end of the year. \u201c Bills arrive into the country, but inflation moves faster than the bank note printing process,\u201d said Armando Gagliardi, a Venezuelan economist working for the local consulting firm Ecoanal\u00edtica. \u201cPrinting and sending the notes can\u2019t catch up with the pace of inflation pace.\u201d [ In Venezuela, the economy may yet do what the opposition couldn\u2019t ] \nThe shortage is an economic disaster for many Venezuelans. Nearly one-third of the population does not have a bank account, making cash essential for survival. \nYorgeliz Mata, the owner of a motorcycle repair shop in the Caracas slum of Petare, said she has lost many clients because of the lack of cash. \u201cMany of my clients don\u2019t have a bank account,\u201d the 40-year-old woman said. \u201cNobody has enough cash to pay me.\u201d \nPablo D\u00edaz, 26, is in a similar situation: he drives a motorcycle taxi in Caracas to earn a living, but clients no longer carry enough cash to pay an average fare. \u201cThey tend to ask me if they can wire the money, but I don\u2019t have a bank account,\u201d said D\u00edaz, who hasn't been able to make many trips recently and is now worried about earning enough to feed his child. \nThere is one group that is still able to get its hands on large amounts of cash, though: those who are willing to \u201cbuy\u201d it. Venezuela has developed a strong black market for cash, and some businesses have sold their supplies of bills to buyers in exchange for small fees. \nA month ago, in a burger restaurant in the city of Barquisimeto in western Venezuela, a man walked up to the counter and asked the owner, whom he didn't know, whether his cash was for sale. \" At that moment we had 3 million bolivares,\u201d said the 30-year-old owner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. \u201cHe wired me the 3 million, plus a 3 percent fee, and left.\u201d The owner did not ask the man what he planned to do with the cash. \nAfter months of waiting, the new bills \u2014 in denominations from 500 to 20,000 bolivares \u2014 are finally circulating. But economist and opposition lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Guerra says the notes arrived too late; they have already lost 70 percent of their value because of the 249 percent inflation between January and July. And the only solution, says Gagliardi, is to print even newer and bigger bills, hoping production finally catches up with reality. \n\u201cThe 20,000 bolivares note is worth just $1.30 at the black market,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, either the government leaps ahead of inflation by introducing bills in denominations up to 500,000, or the cash shortage is going to get worse.\u201d \nRead more:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "armando gagliardi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d\u00edaz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicol\u00e1s maduro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mariana zu\u00f1iga by mariana zu\u00f1iga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yorgeliz mata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eugenio escobar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pablo d\u00edaz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jos\u00e9 guerra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gagliardi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ecoanal\u00edtica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colombia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caracas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caracas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barquisimeto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petare", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:24:44.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4deabf4958f3d635b05525fd010af224296f3595", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgUrB5ZwFQIx89sn5qHm6lwElYO4AUtymkECZdSF3a0mxzgP.NupjPwccLQbSEwCQAQQxlZm9qrLxCb4NXzcTEyfzHSicu49..CmAPyKv6RzIlq4T1tH6bv30y4.AXc09SYlaw2jPw6FMBu1UQJTae.nwJCaV1ohV5kSNPcjnj5HwrmAPfYiG8ZG5tzoe0g6yB8Gy4t7kg.LuK1vcv58_Hv632VUAl7.N8", "site_full": "www.washingtonpost.com", "site": "washingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/linkfest?format=xml", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "StreetEYE.com News Links", "title": "Laurene Powell Jobs is buying a big stake in Wizards, Capitals sports empire - Washington Post", "title_full": "Laurene Powell Jobs is buying a big stake in Wizards, Capitals sports empire - Washington Post", "published": "2017-10-03T19:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/10/02/Others/Images/2017-10-02/Heath-02.JPG?t=20170517", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 177, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 426, "comments": 0, "shares": 426}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 374}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4deabf4958f3d635b05525fd010af224296f3595", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgUrB5ZwFQIx89sn5qHm6lwElYO4AUtymkECZdSF3a0mxzgP.NupjPwccLQbSEwCQAQQxlZm9qrLxCb4NXzcTEyfzHSicu49..CmAPyKv6RzIlq4T1tH6bv30y4.AXc09SYlaw2jPw6FMBu1UQJTae.nwJCaV1ohV5kSNPcjnj5HwrmAPfYiG8ZG5tzoe0g6yB8Gy4t7kg.LuK1vcv58_Hv632VUAl7.N8", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T19:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Laurene Powell Jobs is buying a big stake in Wizards, Capitals sports empire - Washington Post", "text": "October 3 at 9:06 PM Follow @addedvalueth Laurene Powell Jobs, a billionaire philanthropist, entrepreneur and president of the Emerson Collective, is buying a significant stake in Monumental Sports & Entertainment, a sprawling $2.5 billion complex that includes the NBA Wizards, NHL Capitals and Capital One Arena, people familiar with the deal said.\nPowell Jobs\u2019s investment, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, will give her the second-largest stake \u2014 about 20 percent \u2014 in Monumental, the 19-member, Ted Leonsis-led holding company that is one of Washington\u2019s highest-profile enterprises, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been approved by the NBA and NHL.\nThrough her sizable investment, Powell Jobs instantly commands an influential position in the male-dominated ownership circles of the \u201cBig Four\u201d professional sports leagues. Very few women\u2019s names stand atop the ownership list of the NBA\u2019s 30 franchises: Jeanie Buss of the Los Angeles Lakers, Ann Walton Kroenke of the Denver Nuggets and Gail Miller of the Utah Jazz.\nLeonsis will remain the chief executive and largest stakeholder. He will run the teams and affiliated enterprises under the Monumental umbrella, the people said.\n\u201cWe have an agreement with Laurene Powell Jobs, founder and president of Emerson Collective, to join the Monumental Sports & Entertainment ownership group,\u201d according to a statement Monumental issued to The Washington Post. \u201cThe process is underway and is pending league approvals.\u201d Powell Jobs declined to comment for this story.\nMonumental Sports & Entertainment chief executive Ted Leonsis and minority owner Raul Fernandez, far left, join Emerson Collective President Laurene Powell Jobs and her brother Brad Powell, far right at the Mystics playoff game. (Barbara Kinney/Barbara Kinney) Powell Jobs, 53, is one of the wealthiest women in the world, estimated to be worth about $20 billion. Much of that comes from her stock in Apple, the iconic company co-founded by her late husband Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. She also owns 4 percent of the Walt Disney Company.\nThe investment by Powell Jobs increases her presence in Washington after her business and philanthropic arm, Emerson Collective, bought a majority interest in The Atlantic magazine from owner David Bradley in July.\n[ David Bradley is selling the Atlantic magazine to Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019s nonprofit ]\nPowell Jobs has previously been linked romantically with former D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty. The two are no longer dating but remain close friends, according to people familiar with the relationship, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is personal.\nPowell Jobs\u2019s brothers, Brad and Greg, have more than a 30-year friendship with Monumental vice chairman Raul Fernandez, dating to their days at the University of Maryland, College Park, one of the people close to the deal said. Fernandez and Greg Powell overlapped as students.\nPowell Jobs was part of a group that unsuccessfully bid on the Los Angeles Clippers a few years ago. At that time, Brad Powell told Fernandez the Powells had an interest in sports ownership. The two began talking about bringing Powell Jobs into the group.\nPowell Jobs wants to use her ownership as a vehicle to accomplish some of her social goals, such as improving education.\n\u201cLaurene and Ted share the same commitment to a double bottom line, that the best companies are those that do good in their communities,\u201d according to one of the people familiar with the deal.\nThe deal would require the approval of both the NBA and NHL. That could come this week.\nPowell Jobs\u2019s investment is part of a trend in which deep-pocketed financiers and Silicon Valley billionaires are buying stakes in professional sports properties, helping drive franchise prices to even greater heights.\n[ My conversation with Warren Buffett about bridge, Bill Gates and a bus ride ]\nThe average NBA franchise value is $1.36 billion, part of a dramatic rise over the past five years, according to Forbes. Monumental has grown, too, thanks also to a television deal that gave the sports empire a one-third ownership in Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic, the regional sports network.\nForbes earlier this year estimated the Wizards\u2019 value at $1 billion, but after recent sales in the league \u2014 including the Houston Rockets for $2.2 billion \u2014 the team is worth much more than that. The value of the Capitals has climbed, too, with an estimated worth of $575 million, according to Forbes.\nMonumental has expanded under Leonsis and includes the WNBA Mystics, the Washington Valor and Baltimore Brigade Arena Football League teams, investments in e-sports ventures, a sports facility in Northern Virginia and a 5,000-seat Wizards practice facility planned to open in Southeast Washington in 2018.\nPowell Jobs and her vast wealth will probably enhance stability to Monumental\u2019s ownership group. If Leonsis, 60, retired, Powell Jobs has the resources to assume his shares. Leonsis has long been the lead shareholder, with around 40 percent. Most contracts with a stake of this size include language that allows the buyer, in this case Powell Jobs, the option of a path to ownership.\n[ A how-to guide from the ultra-rich: What to tell your kids about money ]\n\u201cLeonsis retains the largest share, is majority owner and remains chief executive,\u201d said a person close to the deal. \u201cLaurene was brought in for the growth and the future of the clubs. Ted will take Laurene\u2019s counsel, and he will work to use the teams to benefit the city and the causes we all hold dear.\u201d\nBecause of the dramatic increase in sports franchise values, Powell Jobs is almost certainly paying a higher price for shares in Monumental than investors who have held stakes dating back from four years to 18. None of the shareholders is expected to leave Monumental, but some may be selling shares to Powell Jobs, people familiar with the matter said.\nAsked whether Monumental shares were being diluted and if any partners were selling shares, one person said \u201ceveryone is committed to the future of MSE and remaining as partners.\u201d\nMonumental\u2019s investors include some of the most prominent business people in the Washington area: Fernandez heads his private investment company Fernandez Group, philanthropist and BET co-founder Sheila Johnson, investor Fredrick Schaufeld, real estate scion Mark Lerner, whose family also owns baseball\u2019s Washington Nationals, investor and philanthropist Earl Stafford, Capital One founder Richard Fairbank and real estate investor Michelle DiFebo Freeman.\n[ An epic winning streak on Wall Street \u2014 then one ugly loss ]\nBillionaires have jacked up franchise values for professional sports teams across the board. A game-changer was Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer, who shelled out $2 billion \u2014 of his estimated $30 billion-plus net worth \u2014 to buy the NBA Los Angeles Clippers in 2014. That deal made NBA teams hot properties, culminating in the recent sale of the Houston Rockets.\nThe past few years have seen financiers buy up professional sports teams across the leagues. The Boston Celtics, one of the NBA\u2019s iconic teams, has a list of partners that include some of the biggest names in private equity and venture capital. Financiers also bought Major League Baseball\u2019s Los Angeles Dodgers for $2.15 billion in 2012.\nBillionaire investor Tony Ressler bought the Atlanta Hawks in 2015 for $850 million. Los Angeles investor Mark Attanasio owns the Milwaukee Brewers. Across town, the Milwaukee\u2019s NBA Bucks are co-owned by New York-based hedge fund manager Marc Lasry.\nPowell Jobs is investing in a league that is flush with cash, thanks to a $24 billion TV deal with ESPN and TNT. It also enjoys relative labor peace with its players.\nWhile saddled with a $200 million mortgage on its privately built, 20-year-old arena in downtown DC, Monumental is close to breaking even financially, according to people familiar with Monumental , who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is not a public company .\n[ Warren Buffett\u2019s $100 billion problem ]\nLeonsis is chairman of the company, an endeavor that began with his purchase of the Capitals from sports entrepreneur Abe Pollin in 1999 for $85 million. He also bought just under one-half of the Wizards and the arena at the time with a path to assuming full ownership one day. Pollin died in 2009. Pollin\u2019s widow, Irene, became the owner until Leonsis and his partners bought the rest of the Wizards and the sports arena a year later. The entire value of the NBA team and the facility was put at $550 million then.\nThe Wizards and the Capitals have been on an upswing under Leonsis, although neither franchise has been able to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on its regular season success in the playoffs. The Capitals have had a long run of success during the regular season, but haven\u2019t reached the Stanley Cup Finals in 20 years.

By Tim Bontemps By Tim Bontemps October 3 at 8:29 AM Follow @TimBontemps Lonzo Ball has yet to play that counts for the Lakers, but he\u2019s already the new face of the franchise. (Sean M. Haffey/Getty) \nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Typically, NBA teams do their best to remove pressure from their young players. Some come off the bench for a time; others share the spotlight with veteran players until they become able to carry a franchise. \nBut Lonzo Ball isn\u2019t your typical NBA youngster. And the Los Angeles Lakers are anything but a typical team. \nSo when the Lakers played their first preseason game Monday night, the video montage at Staples Center began and ended with Ball, and featured him far more than any other player. When the starting lineup was announced a few minutes later, Ball was introduced last. \nThis is not the way most teams would handle a young player. But these are the Lakers, and they are banking on Ball being their next superstar. So, in their eyes, why wait to anoint him their leader on and off the court? \n\u201cWe need him to be,\u201d Lakers Coach Luke Walton said after a 113-107 loss to the Denver Nuggets. \u201cThe way he plays the game of basketball, everywhere he goes \u2026 if he went to a rec center, people would follow him because he makes people better. \n\u201cThat\u2019s what great leaders do.\u201d [ NBA Podcast: Tim Bontemps previews the Pacific Division ] \nHeady talk about a teenager (for another three weeks) with the burden of becoming the next face of the biggest glamour franchise in American sports before he\u2019s played in a single game that counts. But for all the bluster of his father, LaVar, Lonzo Ball has carried one trait through every level of the sport: He knows what it takes to win. \nThat aura already has begun to affect to these Lakers. No, they won\u2019t be good this season \u2014 in fact, they likely will be terrible. No matter how much talent a team has, running out lineups featuring nine players under 25 \u2014 including three starters who are 22 and under \u2014 is a surefire way to lose lots of games in the NBA. \nBut the mere addition of Ball has infused the franchise with a kind of energy and excitement it\u2019s lacked for years. Ever since Kobe Bryant limped off the court with a torn Achilles on April 12, 2013, the Lakers have been looking for a player to carry this franchise into its next iteration. The resulting four years \u2014 the worst in the team\u2019s glorious history since moving to Los Angeles in 1960 \u2014 did the unthinkable: They made the Lakers irrelevant. \nThat isn\u2019t the case anymore. Even for a meaningless preseason game such as Monday night\u2019s, Staples Center had the kind of energy the Lakers used to inspire. Every time Ball touched the ball, the fans waited with anticipation for something good to happen. \nAnd, more often than not, it did. Yes, Ball had four turnovers, including one particularly ugly fling out of bounds that went nowhere near a teammate. But he more than counterbalanced that with moments such as a step-back three on the left wing, an alley-oop off a give-and-go on a fast break with Jordan Clarkson and an and-one over Paul Millsap on another fast break opportunity. [ NBA socks, long coveted for their comfort, are popping up on feet around MLB and beyond ] \nThe resulting line \u2014 eight points, three rebounds and four assists in 21:26 \u2014 may not be eye-popping, but that isn\u2019t the point. The Lakers have built a team suited Ball\u2019s talents, and believe he can drive the entire group forward. He already has earned the respect of his veteran teammates. \n\u201cI\u2019m really impressed with him,\u201d Luol Deng said. \u201cFirst of all, his IQ on the basketball court \u2026 for his age, he sees a lot of things a lot of people don\u2019t see. That\u2019s a great quality to have in a point guard. \n\u201cBut off the court is where I\u2019m surprised the most. The kid works really hard. He\u2019s in the gym working on his game. Very respectful, very quiet, studying the game every time we are in the locker room. But definitely you can tell he\u2019s serious about the game.\u201d \nBall appears to be serious about everything, in stark contrast to his father\u2019s carnival barker act , which saw its latest act play out Monday when he announced his youngest son, LaMelo, would be home-schooled for the next two years because of disagreements with his high school coach. \nWhile he\u2019s more than happy to sport the family\u2019s Big Baller Brand clothing line \u2014 as he did for Monday\u2019s postgame news conference, where he wore a blue sweatsuit bearing the line\u2019s Triple-B logo prominently \u2014 he answers questions with the same minimalist efficiency with which he plays the game. It\u2019s a combination of polite and perfunctory that isn\u2019t often seen among players with massive amounts of attention heaped on them as they approach their 20th birthday. \nIt\u2019s something he\u2019ll have to lean on in the weeks and months ahead, as he adjusts not only to the usual rigors of life as a rookie in the NBA, but the far more difficult task of being the face and fulcrum of everything his team does \u2014 and especially when that team is the Lakers. [ LaVar Ball says he\u2019ll home-school son LaMelo and pull him out of high school basketball ] \nEven a minor ankle sprain, such as the one Ball suffered in the first half (he returned for a stretch in the second half before sitting out the remainder of the game), becomes a potentially team-crippling situation. The Lakers have plenty of other young talent, including fellow rookies Josh Hart and Kyle Kuzma, second-year forward Brandon Ingram and center Ivica Zubac and third-year forward Larry Nance. \nBut even Walton admitted that if Ball has to miss any time, the team will be dealt a significant setback. \n\u201cHopefully when he wakes up in the morning it\u2019s not too sore,\u201d Walton said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not because I really want to win the next game, I just know if he can\u2019t practice and he can\u2019t be out there on the court with the guys, [and playing] the way we want to play, it is just going to slow down that process.\u201d \nIt\u2019s just another example of the unique position in which Ball finds himself. For a team and a city built on star power, the Lakers are betting on Lonzo Ball being the foundation of their next great team. Now it is up to him to justify their expectations. \nAre you interested in smart, thoughtful analysis of the NBA from The Washington Post and around the Web delivered to your inbox every Monday morning?

You\u2019re all set! \nReader Arne Langstmo passed along this letter, asking, \u201cCan this possibly be legal, if true?\u201d \nI asked the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, and here was their answer: \nThank you for your email inquiring about the Workers World denial. We completely understand the confusion created and accept full responsibility for the poorly written reason for denial. \nFirst of all, there are NO current issues of Workers World on the DOC Denied Publication list. Inmates have received Workers World in the past and continue to do so. The letter to which you refer was a denial from one State Correctional Institution to ONE inmate. It was a first level denial. Pursuant to our policy, DC-ADM 803, we must provide notice to publishers at the first level of appeal. The letter at issue was to provide the publisher with notice of a denial and the opportunity to appeal. No publications are placed on a statewide ban without review by the Policy Office. This particular issue has not been reviewed yet. \nThe reason for the denial was grossly inaccurate. The Department of Corrections does NOT tolerate racism in any form and supports policies of equality. The denial was based on language in an article about White Supremacy that was interpreted as a literal call to violence rather than an ideological statement. \nWe will review the entire issue and make a determination whether the denial should be overturned to the inmate to whom it was denied. Again, the reason had nothing to do with white supremacy other than what was interpreted as a call for a potential violent act. \nPlease let us know if you have any questions. \nPrisoners\u2019 free speech rights \u2014 including their rights to receive information \u2014 are much more limited than the rights of those outside prisons, but they aren\u2019t completely lost; and certainly a viewpoint-based ban on speech because it opposes white supremacy would be unconstitutional. But banning material that calls for violence (even in ways that would be constitutionally protected outside prison under Brandenburg v. Ohio ), or that otherwise undermines prison security, is permissible. If the Department response is right that the original letter mischaracterized the situation, and it was the \u201cjoin the fight\u201d part (with the fight referring to violence) that triggered the prohibition and not the \u201cagainst white supremacy\u201d part, that should be constitutional. \nUPDATE: In response to a reader comment about the initial letter saying the denial was for all inmates \u2014 as opposed to the reply, which said it was just for one \u2014 I followed up with the Department; they responded by saying that they had an updated publisher form letter, which reflects the policy of a first-level denial affecting only one inmate: \nTo: \nFrom: Office of Policy, Grants & Legislative Affairs Pennsylvania Department of Corrections", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eugene volokh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arne langstmo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "volokh conspiracy opinion opinion interpretation", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "pennsylvania department of corrections", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "workers world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of corrections", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "policy office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pa.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandenburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:34:03.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe0b8f4147c3d5925e5007f021cefe3d7763682f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgW0izAs9LRh.tPhD8RVebZwgE3sbqaGDq8d_CotsUT6w9JUGXtUzVzPC3Bh2vTIAvlVCfEihwsScwlSA4TMrcZaGbEZXMUss6mJ6PGgn5Lz_p3KY8uLo8chsTGbaD88e9AYQBKd3QynuAjLbW8D1R.A--", "site_full": "www.washingtonpost.com", "site": "washingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/feed/", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "Act Four", "title": "Kara Walker\u2019s work is meant to drive you crazy.

By Alyssa Rosenberg By Alyssa Rosenberg October 3 at 9:00 AM Follow @AlyssaRosenberg A picture of \u201cThe (Private) Memorial Garden of Grandison Harris,\u201d by Kara Walker. (Alyssa Rosenberg) \nOne of the things I enjoy most about going to a show by the artist Kara Walker is looking at other visitors as they look at her art. At most exhibitions, there wouldn\u2019t be much more to gain from this practice than the routine joys of people-watching. But with Walker\u2019s work, part of the fun is seeing other people discover exactly what they\u2019ve gotten into. When I visited her most recent show at the Sikkema Jenkins & Co. gallery in Manhattan in September, I had one of those moments while sneaking a glimpse at a pair of women trying to orient themselves to the first piece on display, which is sexually explicit even by Walker\u2019s standards. Presumably they had sought out the show because they had some sense of what they were going to see. But even so, they didn\u2019t expect that. \nWalker knows exactly what she\u2019s doing, which is why a statement that appears outside the door tweaks every possible category of person who might end up walking through it. \n\u201cScholars will study and debate the Historical Value and Intellectual Merits of Miss Walker\u2019s Diversionary Tactics,\u201d she declares. \u201cArt Historians will wonder whether the work represents a Departure or a Continuum. Students of Color will eye her work suspiciously and exercise their free right to Culturally Annihilate her on social media. Parents will cover the eyes of innocent children. School Teachers will reexamine their art history curricula. Prestigious Academic Societies will withdraw their support, former husbands and former lovers will recoil in abject terror. Critics will shake their heads in bemused silence. Gallery Directors will wring their hands at the sight of throngs of the gallery-curious flooding the pavement outside. The Final President of the United States will visibly wince. Empires will fall, although which ones, only time will tell. \u201d \nThen, of course, she goes on to say that she\u2019s exhausted by trying to explain herself: \u201cI know what you all expect from me and I have complied up to a point.\u201d \nSo rather than try to dissect Walker\u2019s show to uncover some hidden meaning when her ideas about the way American racism manifests through both sex and violence are obvious, I want to write about what her show meant to me. \nThe works in the exhibition were completed in 2017, during the first year of Donald Trump\u2019s administration and, more broadly and relevantly, during a year when it feels as if the specters of the past are coming back and coming after us. I hope I wasn\u2019t foolish enough to believe that Confederate apologists, neo-Nazis and white supremacists were gone from the earth for good, but it has been horrifying to see them scuttle out from the rocks where they normally linger to instead bask in sunlight \u2014 or the glow of tiki torches, at least. \nSo it feels fitting that a recurring motif in Walker\u2019s show is graves dug but not filled and bodies that haven\u2019t been properly interred. In \u201c U.S.A. Idioms ,\u201d a little black girl is either tying up or undoing the bandages over the eyes of a grievously wounded white man next to a hole in the dirt. In \u201c The (Private) Memorial Garden of Grandison Harris ,\u201d a black man drags the body of a black woman away from the grave; Grandison Harris was a so-called resurrection man and slave who stole bodies for the students at the Medical College of Georgia to dissect . \u201c Dredging the Quagmire (Bottomless Pit) \u201d suggests that no matter how much you exhume, there\u2019s always something else dead floating up from the fathoms. In other works, bodies are hooked, throats are slit, people are tied to stakes on the ground and disemboweled or whipped, women are branded, children are impaled, and decapitated heads are held up like trophies and displayed on platters. \nThis is a vision of the world that is endlessly violent \u2014 one act always follows another, and it\u2019s not clear whether any individual\u2019s torment ever ends. \u201cAlive Not Dead\u201d is the title of a piece that depicts a child impaled on a branch. It\u2019s Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno\u201d as American history, but without the reassurance that the punishment has been cleverly tailored to any actual crime. One piece is even called \u201c Slaughter of the Innocents (They Might be Guilty of Something) .\u201d \nBut for all Walker\u2019s work is damning, it\u2019s not completely grim, which is the other great power of her work: She\u2019s very good at getting you to laugh in surprise or smile at something that makes you feel uncomfortable. I was startled and then darkly delighted to see Trayvon Martin as the beheaded St. John the Baptist and to witness Walker\u2019s riff on the death of Sardanapalus, the last king of Assyria and a figure of Greek history. Walker\u2019s smarter than a lot of us who show up to look at her work, but she leaves it up to you how deep you want to dive in to any of her allusions. How close you\u2019re willing to get isn\u2019t just a measure of how much you\u2019re willing to be confronted by Walker\u2019s work. It\u2019s also a measure of whether you\u2019re capable of seeing beyond your own shock.

But top Republicans have waved off its conclusions biased assumptions, including that their proposal would concentrate 80 percent of its benefits among the top 1 percent of earners. \n\u201cLook, I love Rand Paul. He and I play baseball together as well, and he\u2019s a friend,\u201d House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) said Monday . \u201c(But) this is not the group you go to ... they have none of the key details that would allow an objective, complete analysis.\u201d \nWhile they fill in those details, Republicans will mind another warning sign from a potentially key senator. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) brokered the Senate Budget Committee deal to authorize Republicans to move a $1.5 trillion tax cut with only Republican support. But Corker said in a Sunday appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he\u2019ll oppose a final package if \u201cwe are adding one penny to the deficit.\u201d \nIt\u2019s not clear how Corker will make that determination. He said Monday he\u2019ll consider opinions beyond those of the official congressional number-crunchers: On tax reform, \"I'm open to looking at other rational scoring mechanisms,\" Corker says. Not just Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation \u2014 Joseph Lawler (@josephlawler) October 2, 2017 \nThat suggests Corker wants to extend more credit to the growth effects of a big tax cut than will the scorekeepers on the Hill. But he also wants politically painful cuts to existing tax breaks, as The Post's Kelsey Snell reports : \u201cI do know that it takes $4 trillion of loophole closing to execute what they want to execute,\u201d Corker said Monday. \u201cI\u2019m all for the most draconian loophole closing that can possibly take place, but I haven\u2019t seen Congress do those sort of things.\u201d \nThese aren\u2019t quite red lines. They\u2019re more like pink dashes. But they point toward a narrowing lane for the GOP as it seeks to steer a path for a tax overhaul through competing GOP demands. \nLas Vegas shooting update: The toll is up to 59 people killed and more than 500 injured when a gunman opened fire from a perch at a high rise hotel down into a country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip late Sunday. \nPolice do not yet have a motive for what is the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, report The Post\u2019s Lynh Bui, Matt Zapotosky, Devlin Barrett and Mark Berman. Stephen Paddock, the 64-year-old shooter , had smuggled 23 guns inside his 32nd floor hotel room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. More firearms were found at his home. \nAuthorities say Paddock had no known previous run-ins with police and, despite a claim of responsibility from the Islamic state, no connection was found with terrorist groups. In the hours after the shooting, area blood donation centers were packed with lines stretching around blocks. Several vigils were held Monday night in Las Vegas, Reno, the Nellis Air Force Base and at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus in honor of the victims of the shooting.

REUTERS/Mike Blake \n\u2014 Gun stocks up after Las Vegas shooting . CNNMoney's Paul La Monica : \"Gun stocks rose Monday following the deadliest mass shooting in American history late Sunday night. A gunman in a hotel room at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas killed at least 58 people attending an outdoor concert and wounded over 500 more.Shares of Sturm Ruger (RGR) were up 4%, while American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), the company formerly known as Smith & Wesson, gained more than 3%. A company named Olin (OLN), which owns the Winchester brand of ammunition, rose 6% to an all-time high. The stocks have tended to rally in the immediate aftermath of mass killings, which sadly have become more routine.\" \n(For what it's worth, as my colleague Christopher Ingraham notes , there's a long list of common-sense gun measures that draw support from super-majorities of the electorate. That sentiment doesn't transmit to where it counts, in Congress.) President Donald Trump\u2019s tax proposal would probably weigh on the U.S. government\u2019s credit outlook, on concerns that it would cause the federal deficit to swell, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Bloomberg Optimism about the return of the \"Trump Trade\" hasn't carried over into the long-term positioning by currency and bond investors.

Politico POCKET CHANGE A Goldman Sachs sign is seen above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (Reuters/Lucas Jackson) \n\u2014 Goldman explores trading bitcoin. The Wall Street Journal : \"Goldman\u2019s effort is in its early stages and may not proceed, the people said. The firm\u2019s interest, though, could boost bitcoin\u2019s standing among investors and fuel the debate around digital currencies, which were initially viewed as havens for illicit activity but are pushing further into the mainstream investment world. \nChina in recent weeks has banned exchanges that trade bitcoin, fearing the virtual currency could provide an avenue for capital flight. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive James Dimon, whose bank is the largest dealer in global currencies, last month called bitcoin a 'fraud' and said he would fire any employee who traded it. \nYet Japan\u2019s government has embraced bitcoin, creating regulations to legitimize its trading. India and Sweden have mused about creating their own virtual currencies, and the U.S. Federal Reserve has studied bitcoin and the technology underpinning it.\" \n\u2014 Wall Street won't mind if NAFTA talks fail . Bloomberg's Ben Bartenstein : \"Months of high-level meetings from Mexico City to Washington to Ottawa may be for naught as the Trump administration pushes for ground on contentious issues that Canadian and Mexican negotiators are reluctant to cede. That\u2019s not necessarily unwelcome news on Wall Street. Investor anxiety in Mexico, as measured by the peso\u2019s three-month implied volatility, declined the most of any developing nation during the third quarter as the United States\u2019s insistence on reducing its trade deficit risks scuttling the talks.\" The first Supreme Court argument of the new term suggested the justices are divided over the power of employers to block class-action lawsuits by workers and channel disputes into arbitration.

Reuters MONEY ON THE HILL Ex-CEO of Equifax Richard Smith. (Joey Ivansco/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP) \n\u2014 Equifax takes Wells Fargo's baton as industry villain . Bloomberg's Elizabeth Dexheimer, Jesse Hamilton, and Jennifer Surane : \"Executives from both companies will travel to Capitol Hill this week to testify in overlapping hearings about efforts to aid customers stung by lapses at their firms. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are eager to use Wells Fargo\u2019s retail bank scandals and Equifax\u2019s massive data breach to push their political agendas on everything from computer security to financial regulation. \nFor Wells Fargo, the congressional flogging can\u2019t get much worse than it was last year for then-CEO John Stumpf , who was berated and insulted and then ousted. This time around, analysts, lawmakers and their staffers expect Tim Sloan, who succeeded Stumpf, to be better prepared and that his biggest challenge will be to explain why more revelations about fake accounts and other lapses keep dribbling out. \nBut time in the hot seat is just starting for Richard Smith, who stepped down as CEO last week. He will testify before four separate congressional panels , starting Tuesday with the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Federal Trade Commission and a wide range of consumer-protection issues.\" \n\u2014 2.5 million more exposed . The Post's Hamza Shaban : \"An additional 2.5 million consumers may have been affected by the massive data breach at Equifax, the company said in a statement Monday, bringing the new total of potentially affected consumers to a staggering 145.5 million. 'I was advised Sunday that the analysis of the number of consumers potentially impacted by the cybersecurity incident has been completed, and I directed that the results be promptly released,' said interim chief executive Paulino do Rego Barros Jr. \n\u2014 Maxine Waters: Consider shutting down Wells Fargo. CNN's Matt Egan: \"The top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee,issued a 38-page report on Friday slamming regulators for failing to punish the bank more severely for its recent scandals. The report, prepared by the Democratic staff of the committee, described Wells Fargo as a 'repeat offender' for, among other things, opening as many as 3.5 million potentially fake accounts, forcing up to 570,000 borrowers into unneeded auto insurance and allegedly discriminating in mortgage lending.\" \nMeanwhile, the bank's main regulator is considering new sanctions against it, Reuters's Patrick Rucker and Dan Freed report: \"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has for weeks debated how to take action on the insurance and mortgage issues which came to light this summer, said the source. And officials are considering whether to fault the bank for older consumer lending issues, said two sources familiar with the moves. Wells Fargo earlier reached a $190 million settlement with regulators a year ago after it said its branch staff had opened as many as 2.1 million accounts without customers\u2019 authorization to meet internal sales target.\" A Marines helicopter arrives at Isla Grande Airport. (Photo by Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo for The Washington Post) \n\u2014 New hurricane relief bill will top $10 billion . The Post's Ed O'Keefe : \"The White House is expected ask for another short-term infusion of cash to pay for the response to the damage caused by Hurricane Maria across Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to top congressional aides. In the case of Puerto Rico, officials there and some lawmakers on the mainland are clamoring for legislation that would provide tens of billions of dollars in relief and address Puerto Rico\u2019s long-simmering fiscal crisis, shore up its bankrupt electric company and plug a shortfall in Medicaid funding. Work on a more comprehensive relief package will continue into the fall, the aides said... \nCongress approved $15.25 billion in federal relief last month to pay for recovery operations after hurricanes hit Texas and Florida . As of Monday, the Disaster Relief Fund, operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, still had about $9.4 billion, the agency said. But the response to storms in Texas and Florida has now been compounded by the devastation across Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and officials expect the fund to be depleted in the coming weeks.\" \nThe storms could end up the insurance industry more than $100 billion, The Wall Street Journal reports . The right-leaning business lobby is turning up the pressure on lawmakers to vote for the House Budget Resolution, a key step in the tax reform process. The Hill Sen. Bernie Sanders has made a habit of citing stunning stats about inequality, but too often the numbers oversimplify complex economics. Nicole Lewis Michael Cohen, attorney for The Trump Organization. (Reuters/Stephanie Keith) \nRUSSIA WATCH: \n\u2014 Trump's company had more contact with Russia . The Post's Tom Hamburger, Rosalind S. Helderman and Adam Entous scoop : \"Associates of President Trump and his company have turned over documents to federal investigators that reveal two previously unreported contacts from Russia during the 2016 campaign , according to people familiar with the matter. In one case, Trump\u2019s personal attorney and a business associate exchanged emails weeks before the Republican National Convention about the lawyer possibly traveling to an economic conference in Russia that would be attended by top Russian financial and government leaders, including President Vladi\u00admir Putin, according to people familiar with the correspondence. \nIn the other case, the same Trump attorney, Michael Cohen, received a proposal in late 2015 for a Moscow residential project from a company founded by a billionaire who once served in the upper house of the Russian parliament , these people said. The previously unreported inquiry marks the second proposal for a Trump-branded Moscow project that was delivered to the company during the presidential campaign and has since come to light... \nThough there is no evidence that these Russia-related entreaties resulted in further action, the email communications about them show that Trump\u2019s inner circle continued receiving requests from Russians deep into the presidential campaign.\" \n\u2014 Russians used Facebook tool to identify voters. The Post's Elizabeth Dwoskin, Craig Timberg and Adam Entous : \"Russian operatives set up an array of misleading websites and social media pages to identify American voters susceptible to propaganda, then used a powerful Facebook tool to repeatedly send them messages designed to influence their political behavior, say people familiar with the investigation into foreign meddling in the U.S. election. The tactic resembles what American businesses and political campaigns have been doing in recent years to deliver messages to potentially interested people online. The Russians exploited this system by creating English-language sites and Facebook pages that closely mimicked those created by U.S. political activists.\" \nAnd those ads were seen by 10 million people, Politico's Nancy Scola reports . Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. (Steve Marcus/Las Vegas Sun) \n\u2014 Federal watchdog investigates Zinke . The Post's Lisa Rein : The inspector general for the Interior Department has opened an investigation into Secretary Ryan Zinke\u2019s travel during seven months in office, from his use of taxpayer-funded charter and military planes to his mixing of official trips with political appearances. Nancy K. DiPaolo, a spokesperson for Deputy Inspector General Mary Kendall, described a broad investigation into Zinke\u2019s 'travel in general,' including 'modes of travel, costs and schedules.' \n'It\u2019s not just one trip,' she said. 'It\u2019s seven months of travel.' She said the probe was prompted by numerous complaints from employees and the public and recent newspaper articles. \n\u2014 Jared and Ivanka had another private email account. Politico's Josh Dawsey and Andrew Peterson report : \"White House officials have begun examining emails associated with a third and previously unreported email account on Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump\u2019s private domain, according to three people familiar with the matter. Hundreds of emails have been sent since January from White House addresses to accounts on the Kushner family domain, these people said. Many of those emails went not to Kushner\u2019s or Ivanka Trump\u2019s personal addresses but to an account they both had access to and shared with their personal household staff for family scheduling. \nThe emails \u2014 which include nonpublic travel documents, internal schedules and some official White House materials \u2014were in many cases sent from Ivanka Trump , her assistant Bridges Lamar and others who work with the couple in the White House. The emails to the third account were largely sent from White House accounts but occasionally came from other private accounts, one of these people said.\" THE REGULATORS The SEC had initially said the 2016 breach had potentially allowed hackers to make an illegal profit from stock sales, but had not exposed any personal information.

(Andrew Harnik/Associated Press) By Jill Colvin\u2009|\u2009AP By Jill Colvin\u2009|\u2009AP October 3 at 9:50 AM \nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said Tuesday that local officials in Puerto Rico \u201chave to give us more help\u201d in responding to devastation caused by Hurricane Maria, a defiant response to criticism that federal recovery efforts have been sluggish. \nAs he headed out to visit the island, Trump praised the federal response, telling reporters at the White House that \u201cit\u2019s now acknowledged what a great job we\u2019ve done.\u201d He added that at \u201ca local level, they have to give us more help.\u201d \nAdded Trump: \u201cin Texas and in Florida, we get an A-plus. And I\u2019ll tell you what, I think we\u2019ve done just as good in Puerto Rico, and it\u2019s actually a much tougher situation.\u201d \nThe president is expected to spend more than five hours on the ground, meeting with first responders, local officials and some of the 3.4 million people whose lives have been upended by a hurricane that, in the president\u2019s words, left the island U.S. territory \u201cflattened.\u201d \nThe trip will be Trump\u2019s fourth to a region battered by storms during an unusually violent hurricane season that has also seen parts of Texas, Florida, Louisiana and the U.S. Virgin Islands inundated by floodwaters and high winds. \nNearly two weeks after the storm, 95 percent of electricity customers remain without power, including some hospitals. And much of the countryside is still struggling to access basic necessities, including food, fresh water and cash. \nTrump\u2019s visit follows a weekend in which he aggressively pushed back against critics, including San Juan mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz. Trump responded angrily, deriding the \u201cpoor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help\u201d on Twitter. \n\u201cThey want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort,\u201d he added, scoffing at \u201cpolitically motivated ingrates\u201d who had criticized the effort, and insisting that \u201ctremendous progress\u201d was being made. \nCruz has had accused the administration of \u201ckilling us with the inefficiency\u201d and begged the president to \u201cmake sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives.\u201d \nTrump said Tuesday that Cruz has \u201ccome back a long way.\u201d He later added: \u201cthe first responders, the military, FEMA, they have done an incredible job in Puerto Rico. And whether it\u2019s her or anybody else, they\u2019re all starting to say it.\u201d \nSanders said Cruz had been invited to participate in Tuesday\u2019s events, but it was unclear whether she and the president would meet. \nTrump and first lady Melania Trump are scheduled to attend briefings and meet with Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, as well as the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. They\u2019ll also meet with Navy and Marine Corps personnel on the flight Deck of the USS Kearsarge. \nEven before the storm hit on Sept. 20, Puerto Rico was in dire condition thanks to a decade-long economic recession that had left its infrastructure, including the island\u2019s power lines, in a sorry state. Maria was the most powerful hurricane to hit the island in nearly a century and unleashed floods and mudslides that knocked out the island\u2019s entire electrical grid and telecommunications, along with many roads. \nTrump and other administration officials have worked in recent days to reassure Americans that recovery efforts are going well and combat the perception that the president failed to fully grasp the magnitude of the storm\u2019s destruction in its immediate aftermath. \nWhile early response efforts were hampered by logistical challenges, officials say that conditions, especially in the capital, have improved. \nAccording to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, there are now more than 10,000 federal officials on the ground on the island, and forty-five percent of customers now have access to drinking water. Businesses are also beginning to re-open, with 60 percent of retail gas stations now up and running. \nFor many, however, that isn\u2019t enough.

Got it On this Monday Oct.2, 2017 photo, school teacher Elisa Aroca stands in front of the Estel School in central Barcelona where National Police confiscated ballot boxes during the referendum voting. Aroca says, Spain lost the battle for the hearts and minds of Catalonia people when on Oct. 1, 2017, a squad of riot police roughly tossed her and other voters aside, shattering the glass entrance of the Estel School to confiscate ballot boxes, and she felt something break inside of her. (Mstyslav Chernov/Associated Press) By Joseph Wilson\u2009|\u2009AP By Joseph Wilson\u2009|\u2009AP October 3 at 9:26 AM \nBARCELONA, Spain \u2014 For teacher Elisa Aroca, Sunday was the moment Spain lost the battle for the hearts and minds of 7.5 million people living in the Catalonia region. \nAroca intended to defend her Spanish roots and cast a ballot against Catalonia breaking away from the rest of the country. But when a squad of police in riot gear marched up, roughly tossed her and other voters aside and shattered the glass entrance of the Estel School in central Barcelona to confiscate ballot boxes, she felt something break inside her. \n\u201cI felt so angry and hurt inside that I thought, \u2018A country that hits me wants me to stay? You don\u2019t listen to me and on top of it you hit me?\u2019 For me that is abuse,\u201d she said a day later. \nSimilar indignation swept across the wealthy northeastern region, one of 17 in Spain, as police stormed through packs of voters and peaceful protesters at polling stations. \nThe outrage was compounded as mobile phone footage made the rounds on social media, showing officers in body armor pushing people, dragging them by the hair and hitting them with batons. Hundreds of civilians and police officers were injured. The Spanish government, acting on a judge\u2019s order to shut down the referendum, defended the response as professional and proportionate. \nThe ugly scenes run the risk of confirming a long-held belief among many Catalans that the region is chronically mistreated by Spain\u2019s central government despite serving as an economic driver for southern Europe \u2014 it generates a fifth of Spain\u2019s 1.1 trillion-euro economy \u2014 and having a high degree of self-governance. \nCatalan officials said that 90 percent of the 2.3 million people who voted Sunday were in favor of independence. But fewer than half of those eligible to vote turned out. The vote was boycotted by most of Spain\u2019s national parties on grounds it was illegal and lacked basic guarantees, such as a census. \nPolls and the most recent regional elections showed residents of Catalonia roughly split on the divisive issue of independence, but it remains to be seen how many people like Aroca are changing their minds after the events of recent weeks. \n\u201cI was crying from rage,\u201d she recalled. \u201cNow, I was going to vote no matter what. My husband and I didn\u2019t even have to talk about it, we just looked each other in the eyes and we knew that we had to vote. And that we had to vote \u2018yes\u2019 (for independence).\u201d \nBorn of parents from other parts of Spain, Aroca, a 40-year-old mother of two, still wants to embrace a dual identity of both Spanish and Catalan. But she says the political crisis caused by a lack of dialogue between Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Catalan regional chief Carles Puigdemont has forced her to choose. \n\u201cAll bonds have been broken. Not by the referendum, but by the police,\u201d Aroca said. \u201cI feel rage and pain. I think that is how most people feel, seeing what people are chatting about, talks I have had at work. (Sunday) night I was very sad, truly sad that it has reached this point of me wondering what kind of country my daughters will inherit.\u201d \nAroca also believes that Puigdemont and other leaders of the separatist movement are partly to blame for provoking the crackdown when they flouted court orders to stop the vote on grounds that it could violate Spain\u2019s constitution. \nPuigdemont has vowed to act on the results regardless of the legality of the referendum. He is expected to present them this week to Catalonia\u2019s regional parliament, which could trigger the process of starting to break away from Spain. Such a move that would inevitably be met by a robust response from Madrid, and Spain\u2019s interior minister has said the 5,000 extra officers deployed to Catalonia will stay as long as necessary. \nRuben Satinya is afraid more clashes are coming. The 40-year-old father of one felt compelled to join the separatist camp when Spain first tried to stop the referendum. \nWhen a judge ordered police to seal off polling stations before the vote, Satinya joined a groundswell of parents who occupied their local schools from Friday to Sunday, staying overnight in sleeping bags and organizing activities for children during the day. \nThe Congres-Indians School, which Satinya helped occupy, was not hit by police even though it is just a 15-minute walk from the Estel School. \nBut Satinya said voting amid the fear that police could descend at any moment made him feel more Catalan than ever, and convinced him that severing centuries-old ties with Spain was necessary. \nThe transformative experience reached its climax when the polls closed and the crowd gathered at the school joined in singing the Catalan anthem, \u201cEls Segadors\u201d (\u201dThe Reapers\u201d in Catalan). \n\u201cThere really is a different sentiment that sets us apart from the rest of Spain, and that was reinforced in me,\u201d he said. \u201cHearing Els Segadors sung by so many people, I got goose bumps. It was spectacular.\u201d \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

It is like saying we will have \u2018Hamlet\u2019 without the prince of Denmark,\u201d Singhvi told reporters Monday . He called the omission \u201ca clear religious bias which is completely misplaced.\u201d\nAdityanath\u2019s government countered by saying that the state, supported by funds from the World Bank, had slated $22 million to the monument for new gates, beautification and a multilevel parking structure.\n\u201cThe Taj Mahal is the seventh wonder of the world. It has always been a priority not only for Uttar Pradesh but for the entire country of India,\u201d said Awanish Awasthi, Adityanath\u2019s principal secretary. \u201cIt will always be central to all our tourism policy, but there were some other new projects we wanted to feature.\u201d\nThe soaring mausoleum, a UNESCO World Heritage site, was built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his late wife, Mumtaz Mahal, and is considered one of the finest examples of Indo-Islamic architecture.

Domestic tourists decreased by almost 113,400 from 2012 to 2015, officials say.\n[In India, a jaundiced pearl]\nTourism officials have given varying reasons for the decline, including the economy, lack of infrastructure and security concerns after a notorious 2012 gang rape in New Delhi.\nGolden State Warriors player Kevin Durant sparked controversy when he described the poor conditions around the Taj Mahal in blunt terms after a visit there this summer while on an official National Basketball Association tour.\n\u201cAs I was driving up to the Taj Mahal, like I said, I thought that this would be holy ground, super protected, very very clean.

Their focus is on religious tourism.\u201d\nThe Adityanath government has focused on promoting places such as the ancient city of Varanasi, a Hindu pilgrimage site, and Gorakhpur, where Adityanath is the chief priest of a large temple, critics have said. The previous state government had launched plans for a Mughal museum and an orientation center at the Taj Mahal site, but it is unclear whether those will be fully funded going forward, Saxena said.\n\u201cGovernment programs have to be backed by the annual budget,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is no allocation in the budget, it will die a fast death.\u201d\nSwati Gupta contributed to this report.\nRead more\nThe new leader of India\u2019s largest state launches \u2018anti-Romeo squads\u2019 to protect women\nIndia\u2019s millions of new Internet users are falling for fake news \u2014 sometimes with deadly consequences\nIndian judge acquits prominent man of rape, saying a \u2018feeble no\u2019 may mean \u2018yes\u2019\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "muslims", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "washin", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "annie gowen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abhishek manu singhvi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rabindranath tagore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shah jahan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adityanath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "durant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swati gupta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajiv saxena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumtaz mahal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin durant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "awanish awasthi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yogi adityanath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taj mahal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singhvi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saxena", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "golden state warriors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indian national congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hindu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national basketball association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tourism guild", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athletic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of tourism", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taj mahal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varanasi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorakhpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uttar pradesh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:04:26.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ff7831ee6b88c865995ff73f58c99c299fa88fd8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1Og9cFvbHWXDiAB0vEQyM4FPn3wN4iW0N.hqXvdYX3F4G2itCp4IIldoWiKC5RQt8eslI53umfP9wjySlfxTIBrzuGy_ESupccq4tZOVbCYHO1.iNx6g6hs8qPBe9nFP2DDJ2pwHzjYw1UqlmjwgkoDatm0.aZxREPqm2ZN43Bf6YBhOaXf2eSa4Q--", "site_full": "www.washingtonpost.com", "site": "washingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://app.feed.informer.com/digest3/VLZEFJTITH.atom", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "World News Review", "title": "27 years after unification, many Germans still feel divide", "title_full": "27 years after unification, many Germans still feel divide", "published": "2017-10-03T16:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Online/2017-10-03/AP/Images/Germany_Reunification_Anniversary_30906.jpg-c475b.jpg?t=20170517", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 177, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ff7831ee6b88c865995ff73f58c99c299fa88fd8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1Og9cFvbHWXDiAB0vEQyM4FPn3wN4iW0N.hqXvdYX3F4G2itCp4IIldoWiKC5RQt8eslI53umfP9wjySlfxTIBrzuGy_ESupccq4tZOVbCYHO1.iNx6g6hs8qPBe9nFP2DDJ2pwHzjYw1UqlmjwgkoDatm0.aZxREPqm2ZN43Bf6YBhOaXf2eSa4Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kirsten Grieshaber\u2009|\u2009AP", "published": "2017-10-03T16:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "27 years after unification, many Germans still feel divide", "text": "27 years after unification, many Germans still feel divide The inside track on Washington politics.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel waves as she for celebrations on the occasion of the 27th reunification anniversary in Mainz, western Germany, Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2017. (Boris Roessler/dpa via AP) (Associated Press) By Kirsten Grieshaber\u2009|\u2009AP By Kirsten Grieshaber\u2009|\u2009AP October 3 at 9:03 AM \nBERLIN \u2014 German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned Tuesday that although the Berlin Wall came down nearly three decades ago, new walls had emerged in the country \u201cbetween poor and rich, city and countryside, offline and online.\u201d \nSteinmeier was speaking in the southwestern city of Mainz, where he and Chancellor Angela Merkel were celebrating the anniversary of Germany\u2019s reunification 27 years ago. \n\u201cNew walls have emerged, less visible, without barbed wires and death strips,\u201d he said. \nThe usually joyous anniversary celebrations have been overshadowed by a strong showing by the nationalist, anti-migrant Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party in last month\u2019s general election. \nThe AfD did especially well in rural stretches of eastern Germany, prompting soul-searching in the country as to why so many people there voted for the party. \nAfD won 12.6 percent of the vote overall, but captured 22.5 percent in the east. Its success followed a campaign focused on criticism of the chancellor\u2019s decision to open the country\u2019s doors to more than 1 million asylum-seekers over the past two years. \nMany East Germans say they feel left behind and that living conditions didn\u2019t improve as much as they\u2019d expected after the unification. At the same time, anti-migrant sentiment is much higher in eastern Germany, even though the actual number of foreigners living in the east is much lower than in the western part of the country. \nA survey by the Forsa polling agency conducted in September suggested some 55 percent of easterners don\u2019t feel the two parts of Germany have grown together, compared to 45 percent in the west who felt that way.

(Khalil Hamra/Associated Press) By Associated Press By Associated Press October 3 at 9:24 AM \nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip \u2014 The Latest on Palestinian efforts to reconcile Hamas, and Fatah, which have been fiercely divided since the Islamic militant group drove President Mahmoud Abbas\u2019 party from Gaza a decade ago. (all times local): \n4:20 p.m. \nIsrael\u2019s prime minister says his country will not accept a reconciliation deal between rival Palestinian factions that puts Israel at risk. \nBenjamin Netanyahu says the attempt at reconciliation between the Islamic militant Hamas and the Western-backed Fatah must involve recognizing Israel, disbanding Hamas\u2019 military wing and cutting ties with Hamas\u2019 patron Iran. \nAt a meeting of his Likud party on Tuesday, Netanyahu said: \u201cWe are not prepared to accept bogus reconciliations\u201d in which the Palestinians reconcile \u201cat the expense of our existence.\u201d \nThe two factions have launched their most ambitious attempt yet at mending a 10-year rift. Israel has held peace talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads Fatah, but considers Hamas a terrorist group. \n___ \n4:15 p.m. \nHamas\u2019 supreme leader says his group will not give up its weapons, a vow that is sure to complicate reconciliation talks with the rival Fatah movement. \nIn an interview with Egypt\u2019s private On TV, Ismail Haniyeh said Tuesday that his group has \u201cthe right to possess weapons and resist the occupation with all forms of resistance.\u201d \nThe fate of Hamas\u2019 large arsenal of rockets, mortar shells and automatic weapons is a major sticking point in the reconciliation talks that began on Monday. \nFatah\u2019s leader, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, says that all weapons must be under his control. He said Monday that he would not allow Hamas to act like Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group that operates freely in its country. \nThe sides are to begin negotiations next week in Cairo. \n___ \n11 a.m. \nThe Palestinian prime minister has held the first government meeting in Gaza as part of a major reconciliation effort to end the 10-year rift between Fatah and the militant Hamas group. \nRami Hamdallah said after Tuesday\u2019s meeting, which took place at the Gaza residence of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, that he\u2019s ready \u201cto take over tasks and resolve all pending issues\u201d with the coastal strip. \nIn a significant concession, Hamas has agreed to turn over all governing responsibilities to Hamdallah. \nThe Palestinian premier arrived in Gaza on Monday with armed guards and an entourage of West Bank officials to a hero\u2019s welcome from thousands of people. \nHuge posters of Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who brokered the reconciliation effort, were featured outside Abbas\u2019 residence as Hamas policemen were deployed all around. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

In practice, authorities prosecute individuals under such charges as \u201cimmorality\u201d and \u201cdebauchery. \nThe latest crackdown was in response to the raising of the LGBT rainbow flag during a recent concert in Cairo. \nThe crackdown has been condemned by international rights groups. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Got it Max Schrems, front right, faces the media after leaving the High Court in Dublin, Ireland, Tuesday Oct. 3, 2017, as the legal case about social media transfer of personal data between international jurisdictions has been referred to Europe\u2019s highest court. Austrian lawyer and campaigner Max Schrems claims his privacy rights as an EU citizen have been breached through the transfer of his data by Facebook Ireland to US parent company Facebook Inc. (Brian Lawless/PA via AP) (Associated Press) By Danica Kirka\u2009|\u2009AP By Danica Kirka\u2009|\u2009AP October 3 at 9:35 AM \nLONDON \u2014 The European Court of Justice has been asked to consider whether Facebook\u2019s Dublin-based subsidiary can legally transfer users\u2019 personal data to its U.S. parent, after Ireland\u2019s top court said Tuesday that there are \u201cwell-founded concerns\u201d the practice violates European law. \nIn a case brought after former U.S. defense contractor Edward Snowden revealed the extent of electronic surveillance by American security agencies, the Irish court found that Facebook\u2019s transfers may compromise the data of European citizens. \nThe case has far-reaching implications for social media companies and others who move large amounts of data via the internet. Facebook\u2019s European subsidiary regularly does so. \nIreland\u2019s data commissioner had already issued a preliminary decision that such transfers may be illegal because agreements between Facebook and its Irish subsidiary don\u2019t adequately protect the privacy of European citizens. The Irish High Court is referring the case to the European Court of Justice because the data sharing agreements had been approved by the European Union\u2019s executive Commission. \nIreland\u2019s data commissioner \u201chas raised well-founded concerns that there is an absence of an effective remedy in U.S. law . for an EU citizen whose data are transferred to the U.S. where they may be at risk of being accessed and processed by U.S. state agencies for national security purposes in a manner incompatible\u201d with the EU\u2019s Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Irish High Court said Tuesday. \nAustrian privacy campaigner Maximillian Schrems, who has a Facebook account, had challenged this practice through the Irish courts because of concerns that his data was being illegally accessed by U.S security agencies. \n\u201cU.S. citizens would not be allowed to have such mass surveillance as for European citizens and we have to protect our citizens,\u201d Schrems said. \u201cAnd actually, Europe protects anybody because we see it as a human right, not as a citizens\u2019 right.\u201d \nFacebook said standard contract clauses provided critical safeguards and that such safeguards are used by thousands of companies to do business. \n\u201cThey are essential to companies of all sizes, and upholding them is critical to ensuring the economy can continue to grow without disruption,\u201d the company said in statement. \nIt added that it was important that the European court \u201cnow considers the extensive evidence demonstrating the robust protections in place under standard contractual clauses and U.S. law before it makes any decision that may endanger the transfer of data across the Atlantic and around the globe.\u201d \nIn an earlier ruling in the case, the European Court of Justice found that the so-called Safe Harbor regime, which Facebook previously relied on when transferring data to the U.S., violated EU law because it didn\u2019t provide effective legal remedies. The Safe Harbor regime had been established in 2000 by the EU executive Commission, which found that U.S. data protection laws were adequate to protect the rights of EU citizens. \nThe Irish Data Commissioner decided to seek judicial review of standard contractual clauses in part because of \u201cthe very significant commercial implications arising from the value of data exchanges to EU-U.S. trading relationships.\u201d \nThe U.S. government and three other parties were allowed to file friend of the court briefs in the case. The others are the BSA Business Software Alliance, a trade association whose members include Apple, Microsoft and Intel; Digital Europe, which represents the region\u2019s digital technology industry; and the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a U.S. civil liberties group. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Got it By Susannah George\u2009|\u2009AP By Susannah George\u2009|\u2009AP October 3 at 5:14 PM \nIRBIL, Iraq \u2014 As he stepped into office in 2005 to become Iraq\u2019s first Kurdish president, Jalal Talabani told his followers, \u201cI am casting off my Kurdish clothes and wearing Iraqi ones instead. You must accept that.\u201d It was a symbolic call for unity: A longtime leader of Kurdish fighters, Talabani became the head of state of what was supposed to be a new Iraq, freed two years earlier from the rule of Saddam Hussein. \nTalabani\u2019s death on Tuesday was a reminder of how that experiment in unity has frayed nearly to the point of unravelling: Only a week earlier, Kurds voted overwhelmingly in a referendum in support of breaking away from Iraq to form an independent state, sending tensions spiraling with the central government in Baghdad and with Iraq\u2019s neighbors, who fear similar Kurdish separatist sentiment on their soil. \nAt the time of the vote, Talabani had been out of politics for nearly five years after a 2012 stroke left him debilitated and permanently hospitalized. He died in a Berlin hospital at the age of 83 after his condition rapidly deteriorated, according to Marwan Talabani, a relative and senior official in the office of Talabani\u2019s son, the deputy prime minister of the Kurdish region. \nWhile in power, Talabani was seen as a unifying elder statesman who could soothe tempers among Iraq\u2019s Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds. But the country\u2019s centrifugal forces only accelerated after he was hospitalized as Iraq battled the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State group and faced growing demands for Kurdish independence. \nThe referendum vote, which was led by his longtime Kurdish rival, regional President Masoud Barzani, is not expected to lead to a Kurdish state anytime soon and has further isolated the small land-locked region. Iraq and its neighbors have rejected the vote, and Baghdad has banned international flights and threatened to take control of the autonomous Kurdish region\u2019s borders.

Talabani, a lifelong fighter for Iraq\u2019s Kurds who rose to become the country\u2019s president, presenting himself as a unifying father figure to temper the potentially explosive hatreds among Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis has died in a Berlin hospital at the age of 83. (Hadi Mizban, File/Associated Press) \n\u201cIf Talabani had been president of Iraq today for sure the approach would have been different, the balance in Kurdistan would have been different. I don\u2019t think it would have come to a referendum in the first place,\u201d said Joost Hiltermann, of the International Crisis Group. \n\u201cBasically with Talabani\u2019s incapacitation (Kurdish) strength in Baghdad diminished and ... the weight shifted decisively to Barzani and the Kurdish region,\u201d he said. \nTalabani came from a generation of Kurdish leaders who spent decades fighting for self-rule and whose people were often brutally repressed by the central government. \nBorn in a tiny village north of the city of Irbil on Nov. 12, 1933, Talabani was in his early teens when he joined the Kurdistan Democratic Party, or KDP, the main Kurdish political force at the time trying to carve out an autonomous homeland for Iraq\u2019s Kurds. \nIn the 1960s, he joined the Kurdish uprising against the Iraqi government. When the revolt collapsed in 1975, Talabani broke off from the Barzani-headed KDP to form the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, or PUK. To this day Kurdish politics in Iraq remains dominated by the two families: the Barzanis in Irbil and the Talabanis in Sulaimaniyah. \nA year later, Talabani again took up arms against the central government and eventually joined forces with Iran in the Iran-Iraq war. In the late 1980s, Saddam launched the Anfal Campaign, in which more than 50,000 Kurds were killed, many by poison gas attacks. \nIraq\u2019s Kurds took their first steps toward autonomy in the early 1990s under the protection of a U.S.-enforced no-fly-zone aimed at halting Saddam\u2019s killings. But the Kurds quickly fell into infighting. Pitched battles between forces loyal to Barzani and those who sided with Talabani killed thousands and only subsided when Barzani called on Saddam\u2019s army to help him push back Talabani\u2019s men. \nAs the U.S. prepared to oust Saddam in the 2003 invasion, Talabani\u2019s PUK worked with the CIA. After Saddam\u2019s fall, Talabani and Barzani came together to govern their autonomous region, but ultimately Talabani\u2019s high profile took him to Baghdad. \nHe was chosen by parliament as interim president in April 2005. A year later, parliament made him full president under the new constitution, re-electing him to a second four-year term in 2010. \nTalabani\u2019s ascension left Barzani to preside over the Kurdish government alone, an irony that Talabani wryly noted in February 2005. \u201cHe personally prefers that I be in Baghdad and he be in Kurdistan,\u201d Talabani said. \nIn Baghdad, Talabani established himself as the voice of the Kurds and was a skilled player in Iraq\u2019s sometimes bloody power politics. \nSunni Arabs remained suspicious of Talabani, pointing to his Iranian ties. And Talabani angered many Iraqis in 2011 when he described Kirkuk, a multi-ethnic city claimed by the Kurds and the central government, as a Kurdish Jerusalem. \nStill, Talabani sought to cast himself as being above the fray, using the largely ceremonial powers of his post to try to take the edge off conflicts that flared among the country\u2019s factions. \n\u201cContrary to all Iraqi politicians, Talabani believes that making concessions to other groups in order to save his country does not represent a humiliation to his personal dignity,\u2019\u201d said analyst Hadi Jalo. \nIn a statement, former President George W. Bush praised Talabani\u2019s efforts to try to unite his country after Saddam\u2019s ouster, saying: \u201cHe saw the potential of a free and united Iraq. And he worked tirelessly to deliver peace and liberty to his people.\u201d \nLong overweight and afflicted by heart problems, Talabani suffered a stroke in December 2012 and was taken to Germany for treatment. \nWith his departure from political life, Iraq lost one of its few brakes on the divisions among its rival factions and Barzani began dealing with Baghdad directly on behalf of Iraq\u2019s Kurds. \nDisagreements between Baghdad and the Kurdish region over the sharing of oil wealth and the fate of Kirkuk and other disputed areas simmered for years. But those divisions went largely unaddressed as Iraqi and Kurdish forces battled the Islamic State group after it swept across the country in the summer of 2014. \nBarzani, who had already capitalized on a split in Talabani\u2019s political party years earlier, saw his power grow as the U.S.-led coalition rushed military aid to his forces to help them battle the extremists. He later spearheaded the independence referendum, which many of his critics saw as a bid to extend his rule. \nTalabani never expressed an opinion about the referendum, and his supporters were divided on it. \nHis absence left a \u201cpolitical vacuum,\u201d said Falah Mustafa, the head of the Kurdish region\u2019s foreign relations department. But he said Talabani\u2019s \u201clegacy for the Kurdish cause will remain a source of inspiration among the people of Kurdistan and beyond.\u201d \nTalabani is survived by his wife, Hiro Ibrahim Ahmed, and his two sons. One of them is Qubad Talabani, the deputy prime minister of the Kurdish region. \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Adam Schreck and Salar Salim contributed to this report. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

(Max Rossi/Reuters) LONDON \u2014 Is Boris Johnson daring the British prime minister to fire him?\nIt\u2019s a question that some are speculating about as they try to understand the recent antics of Britain\u2019s flamboyant foreign secretary.\nDays before British Prime Minister Theresa May set out her vision for Brexit in a landmark speech in Florence , Johnson penned a 4,000-word article in the Daily Telegraph outlining his plan for exiting the European Union.\n[ British Prime Minister Theresa May offers Brexit details in landmark speech ]\nOver the weekend, Johnson again landed in the headlines. He gave an interview to the Sun in which he appeared to spell out \u201cred lines\u201d over Brexit, some of which seemed to go further than what May has stated publicly.\nAnalysts say such acts of disloyalty normally constitute firing offenses. In Britain, there\u2019s a political norm of collective cabinet responsibility \u2014 the government\u2019s senior leadership team isn\u2019t supposed to air disagreements in public.\n\u201cThere are bounds to what\u2019s considered to be acceptable behavior, and Boris exceeded those bounds by quite some margin,\u201d said Rob Ford, a politics expert at the University of Manchester.\n\u201cTo undercut and attack her before she delivers a banner speech, normally that would be firing territory,\u201d Ford said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if Johnson is daring her to fire him. It\u2019s sort of like, \u2018Come and have a go if you think you\u2019re hard enough.\u2019 \u201d\n[ Conservatives lose their majority in British Parliament amid calls for May to resign ]\nBut it\u2019s not clear that May has enough political capital, after the bungled election earlier this year, to remove Johnson (or others) from his post even if she wanted to.\nMay is in \u201ca quandary,\u201d Ford said. \u201cIf she does nothing, it looks like she\u2019s letting disloyalty go unanswered. If she acts, then she gives Boris potentially what he wants.\u201d\nWhen asked by the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr over the weekend whether Johnson was \u201cunsackable,\u201d May swerved, saying instead that the government was \u201cunited\u201d in its mission.\nIn interviews Tuesday morning, May said she doesn\u2019t lead a team of \u201cyes men\u201d and insisted she was in charge.\nJohnson is a divisive politician but a darling of the annual Conservative Party conference, where on Tuesday afternoon he delivered a lively speech that was light on policies but heavy on optimism.\nHe told the party faithful that it was time for Britain to be \u201cbold\u201d and stop treating the Brexit result as if it were a \u201cplague of boils.\u201d\n\"It is time to stop treating the referendum result as though it were a plague of boils or murrain on our cattle...\" @BorisJohnson on #Brexit pic.twitter.com/sp9JcAtDIO\n\u2014 BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) October 3, 2017\nJohnson dismissed claims of cabinet infighting, saying the entire team was united behind \u201cevery syllable\u201d of May\u2019s recent Brexit speech. He also praised May for her \u201csteadfastness.\u201d\nBut questions about his loyalty remain, and his focus on largely domestic issues \u2014 though he is the foreign secretary \u2014 did nothing to squash rumors that he covets the crown.\nHis speech was reportedly vetted beforehand.\n\u201cHis speech has been looked at, don\u2019t worry,\u201d May told Sky News on Tuesday morning.\nIf Johnson were to be removed from his post, it would come as welcome news to some in the European Union who say that London is sending mixed messages on Brexit negotiations.\nManfred Weber, a senior German member of the European Parliament and a key ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has called for Johnson to be dismissed.\nAccording to a report in the Guardian , Weber asked during a debate Tuesday: \u201cWho speaks for the British government \u2014 Theresa May, Boris Johnson, or even [Brexit secretary] David Davis?\n\u201cBy reading Johnson\u2019s attacks against his own prime minister he shows the British government is trapped by their own party quarrels and political contradictions. \u2026 Please sack Johnson because we will have clear answers as to who is responsible for the British position.\u201d\nIt could be exactly what Johnson wants.\nJohnson, an overtly ambitious politician, was one of the leading lights of the Brexit campaign. And ever since the general election this year, in which the Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority, there has been speculation about how long May will remain in the top job.\nAs Johnson continues to wax poetic about a \u201cglorious Brexit,\u201d he is making clear that he is on the side of the hard-line Brexiteers within his party and that he could be their banner waver in any future leadership contest.

Not only is it one of the biggest financial decisions that most people make in a lifetime, but choosing the place that your family will call home can also be an emotional experience. It\u2019s a big decision, investment and commitment. Luckily, advances in technology are helping to simplify the home-buying experience. \nIn Washington, the ongoing lack of inventory creates a highly competitive environment for house hunters, further exacerbating the stressful nature of the home-buying experience. \nWhile many other tasks have gone digital and can now be completed with a few swipes on a smartphone, in most cases purchasing a home still requires personal visits to physical locations. \nThe Internet has alleviated some of the more time-consuming aspects of the home-buying process. Buyers and their agents can now streamline the process by researching potential homes online first and then conducting in-person visits only to those properties they are serious about purchasing. \nMore recently, social media and mobile applications have simplified the home-buying process even further, with features designed to help buyers and their agents filter out homes that don\u2019t match their criteria. Here are a few examples: \nThe new word of mouth We\u2019re seeing more and more real estate agents leveraging the visual media of social networks such as Instagram and Facebook to market their properties, which is great for serious buyers who want an easy way to keep up with the latest listings and get in touch with their agent. \nBuyers also are tapping into their social networks to get recommendations on the best local agents to work with and the top neighborhoods to check out. Social media are powerful tools for simplifying the home-buying process because they amplify the very best marketing tool for real estate \u2014 word of mouth. \nBig data, big impact Probably the most important part of any real estate decision is location, and the newest technologies streamline the process of finding the right home in the right place through big data. For example, INRIX\u2019s Drive Time application allows real estate agents to identify potential properties for their clients within a specific commute of the buyer\u2019s workplace. [ More Charron: Low inventory and rising prices are forcing many home buyers to become less picky ] \nBefore, buyers had to estimate their commute by calculating the distance in miles and assume they would travel at the speed limit. Today\u2019s tools use real-time traffic information to calculate how long a commute will really take. For Washingtonians who have experienced an hour-long commute to drive just a few miles in gridlocked traffic, tools like these will be invaluable for finding their next home. \nMobile home-buying While we\u2019ve come a long way in terms of conducting the initial research for a home search, the Washington-area housing market moves fast, so serious buyers need more to stay ahead of the game. This is where mobile apps come in, providing buyers and their agents access to the information they need on the go. [ Where demand for homes is growing in the Washington suburbs ] \nApps tied to the multiple-listing-service database, such as Homesnap, have the most current information on listings in the area, and they allow buyers to filter their search by practically any criteria \u2014 school zone, property history, preferred Zip codes, number of bedrooms, square footage and more. \nTo streamline their home search, buyers should look for an app that enables them to share favorite properties with an agent directly in the app. Direct sharing cuts down on the time that buyers and agents spend emailing listings back and forth, so buyers can move more quickly when they find a house they want to call home. Plus, you can invite others into the conversation and share photos and neighborhood statistics. \nAs you search for your new home this fall, take advantage of these new technologies and tools to help simplify the house-hunting experience in and around Washington. \nDavid Charron, chief strategy officer of Rockville-based multiple-listing service Bright MLS, writes an occasional column about the Washington-area real estate market.

(Torin Halsey/Times Record News/AP) Breast cancer death rates declined almost 40 percent between 1989 and 2015, averting 322,600 deaths, the American Cancer Society reported Tuesday.\nBreast cancer death rates increased by 0.4 percent per year from 1975 to 1989, according to the study. After that, mortality rates decreased rapidly, for a 39 percent drop overall through 2015. The report, the latest to document a long-term reduction in breast-cancer mortality, attributed the declines to both improvements in treatments and to early detection by mammography.\nDeanna Attai, a breast cancer surgeon at the University of California at Los Angeles who was not involved in the study, said the advances in treatment included much better chemotherapy regimens \u2014 developed in the 1980s and refined ever since \u2014 that are administered post-surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence. Other improvements have included tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen agent that was approved in the late 1970s; Herceptin, a drug used to treat tumors with a higher-than-normal level of a protein called HER2 and drugs called aromatase inhibitors .\nMore recently, more sophisticated targeted treatments are being used to treat cancer that has spread beyond the breast.\n(American Cancer Society) Even with the gains, however, the toll of the disease remains high. Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in U.S. women and the second-leading cause of cancer death after lung cancer. About 252,000 new cases of breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in the United States this year, and more than 40,600 women are expected to die of the disease. A woman in the United States has a 12.4 percent, or 1 in 8, lifetime risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer.\nBetween 2006 and 2015, the study found, death rates decreased for all racial and ethnic groups tracked \u2014 non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Asian/Pacific Islanders, Hispanics and American Indians/Alaska Natives. But there were substantial variations in mortality the different groups.\nIn 2015, the death rate for black women diagnosed with breast cancer was 39 percent higher than that for white women. While high, that's actually an improvement; the number was 44 percent higher in 2011. The black-white disparity emerged beginning in the 1980s, underscoring that black women have not shared in the screening and treatment advances that have benefited white women. One reason, the report noted, is that black women didn't benefit as much from the development of tamoxifen because they are less likely to have the kind of breast cancer, called estrogen-receptor positive, that is treated with the drug.\nIn seven states, the report found, the mortality rates for white women and black women in 2015 were the same. But the cancer group was cautious about interpreting those statistics, saying that in some of those states there might be too few cases to draw conclusions. However, researchers said they were confident the improvements in reducing or eliminating the racial disparity were real in at least three states: Connecticut, Delaware and Massachusetts.\n\u201cThis means that there is light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d said Carol DeSantis, director of breast and gynecological cancer surveillance research for the cancer society and the lead author of the study. \u201cSome states are showing that they can close the gap.\u201d\nStill, the remaining black-white disparity \u201cis not acceptable,\u201d said Lee Schwartzberg, a medical oncologist at West Cancer Center in Germantown, Tenn. He said the gap reflects complicated social, economic and biological factors that are not yet fully understood, including insurance and employment status. In addition, black women are twice as likely as white women to develop so-called triple negative breast cancer , which can be harder to treat, the report noted.\n\u201cWe have patients who get diagnosed with cancer and have difficulty making their appointments, like radiation every day for four or five weeks\u201d because they can't take off from work, Schwartzberg said.\nThe \u201cexcess death rate\u201d \u2014 the difference between the death rates of black and white women \u2014 ranged from 20 percent in Nevada to 66 percent in Louisiana, the study found.\nEighty-one percent of breast cancers are diagnosed among women ages 50 years and older, the study found, and 89 percent of breast-cancer deaths occur in that age group. The median age at diagnosis for women overall is 62.\nThe findings were published in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and its companion consumer publication Breast Cancer Facts & Figures. The reports are published every two years and cover the latest trends in breast cancer rates, deaths, survival and screening, by race and ethnicity.\nRead more:\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus diagnosed with breast cancer\nIs pregnancy safe after breast cancer?

Several places were being searched in the probe.\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity under internal rules, wouldn\u2019t give more details.\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb said on France-Inter radio Tuesday that the assailant in Sunday\u2019s attack had Italian residency and a valid Tunisian passport. The attacker was killed by soldiers after the stabbings, which were claimed by the Islamic State group.\nOne of the seven IDs the attacker used in previous encounters with French police was a Tunisian passport identifying him as Ahmed H. A judicial official said Tuesday that authorities have determined that is the Marseille attacker\u2019s true identity.\nRome prosecutors opened a terrorism investigation into the suspect, identified in the Italian media as Ahmed Hanachi. He had lived in Aprilia, south of Rome, from about 2006 to 2014, Italian news agency ANSA said.\nHe had a record for petty crimes but no terrorism-related offenses or indications he had been radicalized, Italian daily La Repubblica said.\nThe reports said he lived in an area with a sizeable Tunisian community, and had married then divorced an Italian woman.\nThe region has already seen four people expelled from Italy for alleged radicalization-related reasons, Repubblica said.\nCiting state security, Italy has expelled more than 200 people since 2015 who are suspected of radicalizing others or recruiting would-be jihadis \u2014 offenses that wouldn\u2019t necessarily hold up in court but which the Interior Ministry uses as reason to expel them.\nThe area south of Rome was also where the Berlin Christmas market attacker, Anis Amri, spent about a week in July 2015 after getting out of an Italian prison. There\u2019s no indication the two ever crossed paths, Repubblica said, without citing sources.\nThe French interior minister also said he has ordered an internal investigation into why the Marseille attacker had seven encounters with French police and had no residency papers, but wasn\u2019t expelled from the country. His latest arrest was just two days before the stabbing, when he was picked up for shoplifting and released.\n___\nNicole Winfield in Rome contributed.\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

By Christopher Harris By Christopher Harris October 3 at 10:06 AM Latavius Murray will be a hot commodity on the waiver wire. (Bruce Kluckhohn/AP) \nWell, this is the waiver wire you were waiting for. \nThere weren\u2019t many good-looking solutions for your fantasy football problems in September, but Sunday injuries to Dalvin Cook, Chris Carson and Jordan Matthews will lead to depth-chart shake-ups that could justify a heavy waiver-wire investment. I\u2019m not 100-percent sold that the waiver adds I\u2019m about to mention will solve all your woes, but it\u2019s time to spend that high pick or that large FAAB budget: Subscribe to the Fantasy Football Beat on iTunes | Stitcher | Google Play \nMust-Add: Latavius Murray, RB, MIN \nDalvin Cook is out for the season with a torn ACL, and the Vikings have been leaning heavily on him. Before his injury, Cook had played 160 offensive snaps compared to 48 for Jerick McKinnon and 16 for Murray; without Cook, the team will need a feature back and in my book that\u2019s likeliest to be Murray. He\u2019s coming off ankle surgery and if I\u2019m totally honest, he looked lethargic on film in the second half Sunday: heavy-footed and hesitant. But Murray is a season removed from 12 touchdowns, he\u2019s 6-foot-3 and 230 pounds, he\u2019s 27 years old, and at least before his surgery was considered a burner, having run a sub-4.4 40 at his pro day with good change-of-direction skills. Murray is known for not having the greatest football sense \u2014 it was common for him to run into the backs of his linemen during his time with the Raiders \u2014 and there\u2019s a reason the Vikings were relying so heavily on their prized rookie Cook. But now Murray gets a chance to anchor a run-and-play-defense team behind an improved offensive line. I admit he has a low fantasy floor, but he has the highest ceiling of any free agent you could acquire. [ The top fantasy football takeaways from Week 4 ] \nMust-Add: Thomas Rawls and Eddie Lacy, RBs, SEA \nChris Carson is also probably done for the season with a broken ankle, putting the perpetually in-flux Seahawks backfield back into the blender. \nCarson had clawed his way up the depth chart into a starting role and looked okay Sunday night against the Colts, and now the two veterans he outpaced will get a crack. I prefer Rawls to Lacy, but nobody knows what Seattle will do. (They also have a converted rookie wideout, J.D. McKissic, who scored two touchdowns versus Indy, but he\u2019s awfully small to be a featured player.) Rawls is often injured \u2014 though he was a healthy scratch in Week 4 \u2014 but is a better stylistic comparison to Carson: a try-hard banger who runs through brick walls. Lacy is a very large man who once upon a time scored 24 TDs in his first two pro seasons, but he hasn\u2019t proven a good fit with a Seattle offensive line that struggles to give him a long runway. The truth is, though, either one of these Seahawks RBs makes sense as a waiver add. \nMust-Start: Doug Martin, RB, TB \nThe Buccaneers are sending mixed messages on how quickly they\u2019ll fit the Muscle Hamster back into their backfield plans now that his three-game suspension is over, and rightly so: There\u2019s no reason to give Thursday night\u2019s opponent, the Patriots, any insight into their plans. Jacquizz Rodgers had several slashing, powerful runs Sunday against the Giants and is a serviceable player; it wouldn\u2019t be a shock to see Tampa coach Dirk Koetter work Martin in slowly. But if I\u2019ve been hanging onto Martin since August, it\u2019s time to deploy him in my fantasy lineup. \nI acknowledge the risk \u2014 Martin was a huge bust coming back from a severe hamstring injury in 2016 \u2014 but the reward is too sweet to bypass. New England can\u2019t stop anybody, and Martin\u2019s ability is among the best in the NFL. He\u2019s a risk I\u2019m willing to take. \nTrade For: Jay Ajayi, RB, MIA \nFortune favors the bold. Ajayi hasn\u2019t found the end zone in three games and the Dolphins\u2019 offense should\u2019ve been shut out in back-to-back games against the Jets and Saints. (Only a late meaningless timeout rescued Miami from a scoreless Week 3.) Of course things look dire for the Fins! If they didn\u2019t, why would Ajayi\u2019s owner consider trading him? \nThe player himself has looked fine, has stayed healthy, and has shown glimpses of the elite vision and change-of-direction skills that belie his 223 pounds. The problems with Miami go far beyond Ajayi, and there\u2019s a chance \u2014 especially when Jay Cutler is involved \u2014 they could be unsolvable. But I\u2019m in the business of acquiring fantasy assets on the cheap, and Ajayi is an excellent player. Lowball the Ajayi owner in your league with a couple bench trinkets you aren\u2019t using anyway, and see if they\u2019ll bite. If and when Adam Gase figures out how to stop his team from committing penalties and key mistakes, Ajayi will benefit. [ Colts QB Andrew Luck will finally return to practice ] \nMust-Stream: Deshaun Watson, QB, HOU \nI was willing to chalk Week 3\u2019s big numbers up to some fluke plays against a bad New England defense, but Watson was legitimately impressive Sunday against the Titans. He nailed throws at all three levels, and looked like a completely different player from the kid who struggled on a Thursday night in Week 2. \nHis growing pains aren\u2019t entirely behind him, but Watson\u2019s combination of mobility (both inside and outside the pocket), arm strength and moxie have made up for some inconsistent mechanics, and he\u2019ll be a popular waiver add in Week 5. The Texans play the Chiefs in a national TV game Sunday night, but fortunately it\u2019s at home. If you\u2019re dealing with a bye week for Matt Ryan, Drew Brees or Kirk Cousins, Watson is your man. \nChristopher Harris runs HarrisFootball.com , where you can find more info on the \u201cHarris

(Photo by Katherine Frey/The Washington Post) The number of uncommitted D.C.-area seniors is dwindling as high school basketball season nears, and three more Division I prospects are expected to make their decisions this week. Rock Creek Christian forward Jermaine Harris is announcing his college decision at 2 p.m. on Friday, St. John\u2019s point guard Tre Wood also plans to announce Friday, and Episcopal forward Zach Pfaffenberger will announce his decision on Saturday.\nThis will all come after an eventful start to the basketball recruiting week, as two area seniors made verbal commitments Monday. St. John\u2019s center Richard Njoku verbally committed to Navy, St. John\u2019s Coach Pat Behan told The Post. Southern guard Curtis Holland III then verbally committed to High Point, which he announced in a tweet Monday night.\nBelow is what you need to know ahead of the upcoming decisions for Harris, Wood and Pfaffenberger.\nJermaine Harris, forward, Rock Creek Christian \nSince announcing his final eight schools in July, Harris has not publicly cut any other programs out of his recruitment.\nBut the 6-foot-8 forward has indicated some top options with where he has taken official visits. Harris visited West Virginia in mid-September, Rhode Island a bit later in the month and Xavier this past weekend. Harris originally scheduled official visits to Kansas and Miami in the coming weeks, but he will now make his decision before seeing those schools. Along with West Virginia, Rhode Island and Xavier, a person with knowledge of Harris\u2019 recruitment said that South Carolina is also in the running.\n[ Three transfers, four years: A star and her mom navigate high-stakes basketball recruiting ] \nThe final eight Harris announced in July was Kansas, Maryland, Xavier, Miami, West Virginia, South Carolina, Rhode Island and Southern Utah. He is the area\u2019s best 2018 big man and has the ability to score from the perimeter and inside the paint.\nTre Wood, point guard, St. John\u2019s \nWood has not publicized the schools he is ultimately choosing from, but the 6-foot guard took official visits to the University of Massachusetts, George Mason and Towson. Wood first visited UMass, then George Mason and finally Towson two weekends ago. Official visits are usually a solid indication of the schools a player is considering.\nIf Wood verbally commits to George Mason, he would be the second D.C.-area senior to pledge to the Patriots\u2019 2018 class. George Mason landed the verbal commitment of Loudoun Valley guard Jordan Miller, a 6-foot-4 lefty scorer, at the start of September. Wood and Miller would give the Patriots a very solid backcourt into the future, with Wood\u2019s ability to space the floor from the point guard spot opening up driving lanes for Miller, who likes to go to the rim. Wood is also a very solid slasher and his ability to get inside the paint creates a lot of scoring opportunities for teammates.\nBut Wood, who played his AAU ball for Team Takeover, seems to have a few schools still in the running.\n\u201cWith Tre, I think you get a lead guard who is going to be able to step into a program with incredible experience at the high school and AAU level,\u201d St. John\u2019s Coach Pat Behan said on Monday. \u201cYou get a kid who can run an offense, is a really good on-ball defender and can create for his teammates, too.\u201d\nZach Pfaffenberger, forward, Episcopal \nPfaffenberger\u2019s decision is down to three schools: Mount St. Mary\u2019s, Binghamton and Sacred Heart.\n[ Football or basketball? In age of CTE and AAU, it\u2019s a tough call for players, parents ] \nThe 6-foot-8 forward said Monday that these three programs have been in on him since the beginning of his recruitment. They have also stayed in constant contact in recent months, he said, and now have a chance to add a high-energy, versatile big man to their 2018 class. Pfaffenberger has shed 35 pounds since his freshman season and expanded his offensive game to the perimeter before his junior year. Now he considers himself a viable threat from midrange and beyond the arc, and said he can put the ball on the floor from those spots.\n\u201cI had to change up my game so I could work inside and outside,\u201d Pfaffenberger said. \u201cI think that makes me a good fit at the next level, a bigger guy who can stretch the floor and do a lot of things.\u201d\nIf Pfaffenberger chooses Mount St. Mary\u2019s, he would be the third local senior to verbally commit to the Emmitsburg, Maryland school. The Mountaineers have already received pledges from Bullis point guard Vado Morse and O\u2019Connell shooting guard Matt Becht.\nOther recruiting notes \n\u00bb With Njoku and Holland coming off the board Monday and O\u2019Connell point guard Xavier Johnson verbally committing to Nebraska last week, here is an updated list of D.C.-area seniors who have pledged to Division I schools (in alphabetical order): O\u2019Connell guard Matt Becht (Mount St. Mary\u2019s), Georgetown Prep point guard Jared Bynum (Saint Joseph\u2019s), Gonzaga guard Myles Dread (Penn State), Southern guard Curtis Holland III (High Point), Gonzaga point guard Prentiss Hubb (Notre Dame), O\u2019Connell point guard Xavier Johnson (Nebraska), Paul VI guard Miles Latimer (Stony Brook), Loudoun Valley guard Jordan Miller (George Mason), South County forward Quention Millora-Brown (Rice), Bullis point guard Vado Morse (Mount St. Mary\u2019s), St. John\u2019s center Richard Njoku (Navy), Georgetown Prep forward Ike Nweke (Columbia), Georgetown Prep wing Mezie Offurum (George Washington), Paul VI guard Brandon Slater (Villanova), St. Mary\u2019s Ryken guard Wynston Tabbs (Boston College), Riverdale Baptist point guard Donovann Toatley (Tennessee-Chattanooga)\n\u00bb And here are the top local seniors who have yet to make a college decision (in alphabetical order, with players who are planning to announce this week in bold): Matthew Balanc (guard, Springbrook), Saddiq Bey (forward, Sidwell Friends), Kiyon Boyd (guard, Massanutten Military Academy), Zyan Collins (guard, Freedom-South Riding), Jaden Faulkner (point guard, Eleanor Roosevelt), Deson Flood (wing, Good Counsel), Jermaine Harris (forward, Rock Creek Christian), Ayinde Hikim (point guard, Wilson), Christian Jones (guard, Annapolis), Darren Lucas-White (guard, Fairmont Heights), Daniel Oladapo (wing, Bladensburg), L.J. Owens (point guard, Severn School), Zach Pfaffenberger (forward, Episcopal), Tre Wood (point guard, St. John\u2019s)\n\u00bb DeMatha junior guard Justin Moore picked up offers from Villanova, Maryland and Penn State in the past week, he and DeMatha Coach Mike Jones announced on Twitter. Moore, who missed most of his sophomore season and all of this past AAU circuit after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament last January, now has offers from the Wildcats, Terrapins, Notre Dame, Louisville, Xavier, Wake Forest, Penn State, Old Dominion and Towson. Moore is 6-foot-3 and plays AAU basketball for Team Takeover.\n\u00bb Severn School senior guard L.J. Owens took an official visit to William & Mary this past weekend, D.C. Blue Devils Coach Ricardo Rush told The Post on Sunday. Owens took an official visit to Saint Joseph\u2019s the weekend before that, and is planning official visits to Delaware and Quinnipiac, according to Rush (Owens played for Rush on the Blue Devils\u2019 17U team this past spring and summer). Rush also said that Boston University is making a late push into Owens\u2019 recruitment. BU \u2014 which was not in the final seven schools that Owens released in early September \u2014 offered the 6-foot-3 guard in mid-September, and Rush said Owens is now considering taking an official visit there.\n\u00bb Springbrook senior guard Matt Balanc will take an official visit to Florida Gulf Coast this weekend, Mid-Atlantic Select director James Lee told The Post on Sunday. Balanc, a 6-foot-3 guard, is choosing among Florida Gulf Coast, Rhode Island and Quinnipiac, a final three he announced in September. He was not being heavily recruited until this summer, when strong showings in the three July evaluation periods (while playing for Mid-Atlantic Select) earned him 10 scholarship offers.\nRead more

woman is moved outside the Tropicana during an active shooter situation on the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas Sunday, Oct. 1, 2017. Multiple victims were being transported to hospitals after a shooting late Sunday at a music festival on the Las Vegas Strip. (Chase Stevens/Las Vegas Review-Journal via AP) (Associated Press) By Amanda Lee Myers\u2009|\u2009AP By Amanda Lee Myers\u2009|\u2009AP October 3 at 9:20 AM \nLAS VEGAS \u2014 The victims just kept coming. \nIn cars, in ambulances waiting four or five deep, from the walking wounded to the barely alive, they arrived in droves. \n\u201cI have no idea who I operated on,\u201d said Dr. Jay Coates, a trauma surgeon whose hospital took in many of the wounded after a gunman opened fire from his 32nd-floor hotel suite Sunday night on a country music concert below. \u201cThey were coming in so fast, we were taking care of bodies. We were just trying to keep people from dying.\u201d \nIt was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, with at least 59 killed and 527 injured, some by gunfire, some during the chaotic escape. \nUniversity Medical Center of Southern Nevada was one of many hospitals that were overflowing. \n\u201cEvery bed was full,\u201d Coates said. \u201cWe had people in the hallways, people outside and more people coming in.\u201d \nHe said the huge, horrifying wounds on his operating table told him this shooting was something different. \n\u201cIt was very clear that the first patient I took back and operated on that this was a high-powered weapon,\u201d Coates said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a normal street weapon. This was something that did a lot of damage when it entered the body cavity.\u201d \nThe gunman, 64-year-old high-stakes gambler and retired accountant Stephen Paddock, killed himself as authorities stormed his hotel room at the Mandalay Bay hotel casino. \nHe had 23 guns \u2014 some with scopes \u2014 in the room where he had been staying since Thursday. He knocked out two windows to create sniper\u2019s perches he used to rain bullets on the crowd of 22,000 some 500 yards away. \nHe also had two \u201cbump stocks\u201d that can be used to modify weapons to make them fully automatic, according to two U.S. officials briefed by law enforcement who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is still unfolding. \nAt Paddock\u2019s home, authorities found 19 more guns, explosives and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Also, several pounds of ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be turned into explosives, were in his car, authorities said. \nThe FBI discounted the possibility of international terrorism, even after the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. But beyond that, the motive remained a mystery, with Sheriff Joseph Lombardo saying: \u201cI can\u2019t get into the mind of a psychopath at this point.\u201d \nWhile Paddock appeared to have no criminal history, his father was a bank robber who was on the FBI\u2019s most-wanted list in the 1960s. \n\u201cI can\u2019t even make something up,\u201d his brother in Florida, Eric Paddock, said when asked what might have motivated his brother. \u201cThere\u2019s just nothing.\u201d \nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday called the gunman \u201cdemented\u201d and a \u201cvery, very sick individual.\u201d Asked about gun laws, the president said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be talking about gun laws as time goes on.\u201d \nHis muzzle flashes visible in the dark, Paddock began shooting just after 10 p.m. and appeared to fire unhindered for more than 10 minutes, according to radio traffic, as police frantically tried to locate him. \n\u201cWe can\u2019t worry about the victims,\u201d an officer said over the radio at 10:15 p.m. \u201cWe need to stop the shooter before we have more victims. Anybody have eyes on him ... stop the shooter.\u201d \nThe crowd, funneled tightly into a wide-open space, had little cover and no easy way to escape. Victims fell to the ground, while others fled in panic. Some hid behind concession stands or crawled under parked cars. \nFaces were etched with shock and confusion, and people wept and wailed. Some of the injured were hit by shrapnel. Others were trampled or were injured jumping fences. \n\u201cIt was chaos \u2014 people just running for their lives. People trying to get down. Trying to get to their loved ones that had gotten hit,\u201d Shaun Topper said. \nMarie Langer, 16, of Las Vegas, got to the concert early so she could get to the very front of the venue, closest to the stage. \nThat meant she and her friends were among the last to get out, and could hear shots ringing and people screaming the entire time she was trying to flee. She finally had to climb a fence with points on the top of metal bars designed to prevent people from getting over it. \n\u201cWe had no other option,\u201d she said. \nTales of heroism and compassion emerged quickly: One man grasped the hand of a dying stranger as the man died, unable to pull himself away despite the danger. Another borrowed a flannel shirt from a man he didn\u2019t know to create a tourniquet for a girl he didn\u2019t know. \nCouples held hands as they ran. The healthy carried the bleeding off the grounds. Strangers drove victims to hospitals in their own cars. \nAuthorities put out a call for blood donations and set up a hotline to report missing people and speed the identification of the dead and wounded. They also opened a \u201cfamily reunification center\u201d for people to find loved ones. \nBefore Sunday, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history took place in June 2016, when a gunman who professed support for Muslim extremist groups opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people. \n___ \nSally Ho, Regina Garcia Cano and Brian Skoloff in Las Vegas; Brian Melley and Andrew Dalton in Los Angeles; Sadie Gurman and Tami Abdollah in Washington; Kristin M.

By Jesse Dougherty By Jesse Dougherty October 3 Follow @dougherty_jesse St. John\u2019s point guard Tre Wood will announce his college decision Friday. (Photo by Katherine Frey/The Washington Post) \nThe number of uncommitted D.C.-area seniors is dwindling as high school basketball season nears, and three more Division I prospects are expected to make their decisions this week. Rock Creek Christian forward Jermaine Harris is announcing his college decision at 2 p.m. on Friday, St. John\u2019s point guard Tre Wood also plans to announce Friday, and Episcopal forward Zach Pfaffenberger will announce his decision on Saturday. \nThis will all come after an eventful start to the basketball recruiting week, as two area seniors made verbal commitments Monday. St. John\u2019s center Richard Njoku verbally committed to Navy, St. John\u2019s Coach Pat Behan told The Post. Southern guard Curtis Holland III then verbally committed to High Point, which he announced in a tweet Monday night. \nBelow is what you need to know ahead of the upcoming decisions for Harris, Wood and Pfaffenberger. \nJermaine Harris, forward, Rock Creek Christian \nSince announcing his final eight schools in July, Harris has not publicly cut any other programs out of his recruitment. \nBut the 6-foot-8 forward has indicated some top options with where he has taken official visits. Harris visited West Virginia in mid-September, Rhode Island a bit later in the month and Xavier this past weekend. Harris originally scheduled official visits to Kansas and Miami in the coming weeks, but he will now make his decision before seeing those schools. Along with West Virginia, Rhode Island and Xavier, a person with knowledge of Harris\u2019 recruitment said that South Carolina is also in the running. [ Three transfers, four years: A star and her mom navigate high-stakes basketball recruiting ] \nThe final eight Harris announced in July was Kansas, Maryland, Xavier, Miami, West Virginia, South Carolina, Rhode Island and Southern Utah. He is the area\u2019s best 2018 big man and has the ability to score from the perimeter and inside the paint. \nTre Wood, point guard, St. John\u2019s \nWood has not publicized the schools he is ultimately choosing from, but the 6-foot guard took official visits to the University of Massachusetts, George Mason and Towson. Wood first visited UMass, then George Mason and finally Towson two weekends ago. Official visits are usually a solid indication of the schools a player is considering. \nIf Wood verbally commits to George Mason, he would be the second D.C.-area senior to pledge to the Patriots\u2019 2018 class. George Mason landed the verbal commitment of Loudoun Valley guard Jordan Miller, a 6-foot-4 lefty scorer, at the start of September. Wood and Miller would give the Patriots a very solid backcourt into the future, with Wood\u2019s ability to space the floor from the point guard spot opening up driving lanes for Miller, who likes to go to the rim. Wood is also a very solid slasher and his ability to get inside the paint creates a lot of scoring opportunities for teammates. \nBut Wood, who played his AAU ball for Team Takeover, seems to have a few schools still in the running. \n\u201cWith Tre, I think you get a lead guard who is going to be able to step into a program with incredible experience at the high school and AAU level,\u201d St. John\u2019s Coach Pat Behan said on Monday. \u201cYou get a kid who can run an offense, is a really good on-ball defender and can create for his teammates, too.\u201d \nZach Pfaffenberger, forward, Episcopal \nPfaffenberger\u2019s decision is down to three schools: Mount St. Mary\u2019s, Binghamton and Sacred Heart. [ Football or basketball? In age of CTE and AAU, it\u2019s a tough call for players, parents ] \nThe 6-foot-8 forward said Monday that these three programs have been in on him since the beginning of his recruitment. They have also stayed in constant contact in recent months, he said, and now have a chance to add a high-energy, versatile big man to their 2018 class. Pfaffenberger has shed 35 pounds since his freshman season and expanded his offensive game to the perimeter before his junior year. Now he considers himself a viable threat from midrange and beyond the arc, and said he can put the ball on the floor from those spots. \n\u201cI had to change up my game so I could work inside and outside,\u201d Pfaffenberger said. \u201cI think that makes me a good fit at the next level, a bigger guy who can stretch the floor and do a lot of things.\u201d \nIf Pfaffenberger chooses Mount St. Mary\u2019s, he would be the third local senior to verbally commit to the Emmitsburg, Maryland school. The Mountaineers have already received pledges from Bullis point guard Vado Morse and O\u2019Connell shooting guard Matt Becht. \nOther recruiting notes \n\u00bb With Njoku and Holland coming off the board Monday and O\u2019Connell point guard Xavier Johnson verbally committing to Nebraska last week, here is an updated list of D.C.-area seniors who have pledged to Division I schools (in alphabetical order): O\u2019Connell guard Matt Becht (Mount St. Mary\u2019s), Georgetown Prep point guard Jared Bynum (Saint Joseph\u2019s), Gonzaga guard Myles Dread (Penn State), Southern guard Curtis Holland III (High Point), Gonzaga point guard Prentiss Hubb (Notre Dame), O\u2019Connell point guard Xavier Johnson (Nebraska), Paul VI guard Miles Latimer (Stony Brook), Loudoun Valley guard Jordan Miller (George Mason), South County forward Quention Millora-Brown (Rice), Bullis point guard Vado Morse (Mount St. Mary\u2019s), St. John\u2019s center Richard Njoku (Navy), Georgetown Prep forward Ike Nweke (Columbia), Georgetown Prep wing Mezie Offurum (George Washington), Paul VI guard Brandon Slater (Villanova), St. Mary\u2019s Ryken guard Wynston Tabbs (Boston College), Riverdale Baptist point guard Donovann Toatley (Tennessee-Chattanooga) \n\u00bb And here are the top local seniors who have yet to make a college decision (in alphabetical order, with players who are planning to announce this week in bold): Matthew Balanc (guard, Springbrook), Saddiq Bey (forward, Sidwell Friends), Kiyon Boyd (guard, Massanutten Military Academy), Zyan Collins (guard, Freedom-South Riding), Jaden Faulkner (point guard, Eleanor Roosevelt), Deson Flood (wing, Good Counsel), Jermaine Harris (forward, Rock Creek Christian), Ayinde Hikim (point guard, Wilson), Christian Jones (guard, Annapolis), Darren Lucas-White (guard, Fairmont Heights), Daniel Oladapo (wing, Bladensburg), L.J. Owens (point guard, Severn School), Zach Pfaffenberger (forward, Episcopal), Tre Wood (point guard, St. John\u2019s) \n\u00bb DeMatha junior guard Justin Moore picked up offers from Villanova, Maryland and Penn State in the past week, he and DeMatha Coach Mike Jones announced on Twitter. Moore, who missed most of his sophomore season and all of this past AAU circuit after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament last January, now has offers from the Wildcats, Terrapins, Notre Dame, Louisville, Xavier, Wake Forest, Penn State, Old Dominion and Towson. Moore is 6-foot-3 and plays AAU basketball for Team Takeover. \n\u00bb Severn School senior guard L.J. Owens took an official visit to William & Mary this past weekend, D.C. Blue Devils Coach Ricardo Rush told The Post on Sunday. Owens took an official visit to Saint Joseph\u2019s the weekend before that, and is planning official visits to Delaware and Quinnipiac, according to Rush (Owens played for Rush on the Blue Devils\u2019 17U team this past spring and summer). Rush also said that Boston University is making a late push into Owens\u2019 recruitment. BU \u2014 which was not in the final seven schools that Owens released in early September \u2014 offered the 6-foot-3 guard in mid-September, and Rush said Owens is now considering taking an official visit there. \n\u00bb Springbrook senior guard Matt Balanc will take an official visit to Florida Gulf Coast this weekend, Mid-Atlantic Select director James Lee told The Post on Sunday. Balanc, a 6-foot-3 guard, is choosing among Florida Gulf Coast, Rhode Island and Quinnipiac, a final three he announced in September. He was not being heavily recruited until this summer, when strong showings in the three July evaluation periods (while playing for Mid-Atlantic Select) earned him 10 scholarship offers. \nRead more

Trump arrived in Puerto Rico on Tuesday as the territory struggled to recover from Hurricane Maria, which has left nearly all the island without power and most residents without \u00adwater nearly two weeks later. \nBut Trump\u2019s focus was on the \u201cunbelievable\u201d and \u201cincredible\u201d job that his administration has done so far. He repeatedly played down the destruction to the island , telling local officials they should feel \u201cvery proud\u201d they \u00adhaven\u2019t lost hundreds of lives like in \u201ca real catastrophe\u201d like Hurricane Katrina along the Gulf Coast in 2005. But he also complained that the small territory\u2019s disaster threw the nation\u2019s budget \u201ca little out of whack.\u201d\nAt one brief stop at a church, Trump told the gathering that they no longer needed flashlights, and he tossed rolls of paper towels into the crowd as if they were basketballs. He took a helicopter tour, visited a ship, posed for selfies \u2014 and then left an hour earlier than scheduled.\nThe whirlwind, four-hour visit came amid accusations that the Trump administration did not act quickly enough to help Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands after Maria \u2014 and that the president paid less attention to the territories than to Texas after Hurricane Harvey and Florida after Hurricane Irma. Trump and his aides have responded by attacking critics and seeking to discount news coverage of Maria\u2019s desperate aftermath.\nIn an interview with Fox News later Tuesday, Trump said that Puerto Rico\u2019s large debt \u2014 the island territory filed for bankruptcy earlier this year and facing $72 billion in debt \u2014 will need to be wiped away.\n1 of 30 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Photos from President Trump\u2019s visit to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico View Photos", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "jim lo scalzo/epa-efe/rex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmen yul\u00edn cruz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah huckabee sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melania trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ricardo rossell\u00f3", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmen yulin cruz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cruz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashley parker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria ]  though trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rossell\u00f3", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "washington post trump", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marine corps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bedminster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.j", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shutterstock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san jose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenneth mapp of the u.s. virgin islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:19:32.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1742a925e15e4a07eb1bb5f0d578e91a2ef49867", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgW0izAs9LRh8ZbNrbJX7KXqzzdDdMi3H179XRSe16jjFnFGR5DbfEfaHL93oEoHgt7zPbDGpQfCR2W1o7yz7GmdD0H0aWeK8zuBlzi3zhyRPMrxNFzRl4DUmlsYV6nP06JW_kOo8KlzIwhvu5PpxmDw--", "site_full": "www.washingtonpost.com", "site": "washingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/feed/", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "Arts and Entertainment", "title": "The fashion world\u2019s fantasy about women caught in the rain", "title_full": "The fashion world\u2019s fantasy about women caught in the rain", "published": "2017-10-03T18:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/files/2017/10/mcqueenmontage.jpg&amp;w=1484&amp;op=resize&amp;opt=1&amp;filter=antialias&amp;t=20170517", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 177, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 25, "comments": 0, "shares": 25}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1742a925e15e4a07eb1bb5f0d578e91a2ef49867", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgW0izAs9LRh8ZbNrbJX7KXqzzdDdMi3H179XRSe16jjFnFGR5DbfEfaHL93oEoHgt7zPbDGpQfCR2W1o7yz7GmdD0H0aWeK8zuBlzi3zhyRPMrxNFzRl4DUmlsYV6nP06JW_kOo8KlzIwhvu5PpxmDw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Robin Givhan", "published": "2017-10-03T18:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "The fashion world\u2019s fantasy about women caught in the rain", "text": "One in a series on the clothes that had a moment at Paris Fashion Week : Alexander McQueen Spring Summer 2018 collection (Stefan Knauer/MCV Photo For The Washington Post) \nPARIS \u2014 Fashion designers love the rain.

They love the idea of a woman caught in the rain, perhaps while walking through a noir cityscape or a tangled country garden. \nThe woman in their head is wearing spectacular clothes. Clothes that are impervious to rain. In fact, she is wearing clothes that somehow look better after they\u2019ve taken a beating in the elements. Her hair is plastered to her head and sopping wet.

That was the idea behind Sarah Burton\u2019s spring 2018 collection for Alexander McQueen. She situated her models in an English garden, creating a runway of ceramic bricks and adorned with floral canopies draped over rustic gazebos. And she made them look as if they\u2019d been caught in a downpour. \nHer models walked out dressed in memories and history. An embroidered ivory dress, fit for a bride, was draped over a pair of black trousers; black and white blazers are tailored for a business day; corseted party dresses exploded with ruffles; white lace decorated metallic silver coats.

(Robert Cohen/Associated Press) The Post reports that \u201c Russian Facebook ads showed a black woman firing a rifle, amid efforts to stoke racial strife .\u201d It\u2019s yet more proof that the Russian government was all over the 2016 presidential election, like so many Agent Smiths on Neo , except the American electorate wasn\u2019t as nimble as Neo. But the story demonstrates what Evan McMullin told me a year ago during an interview for my podcast \u201cCape Up.\u201d\nMcMullin is the former covert CIA operative who ran a third-party candidacy against both now-President Trump and Democratic Party challenger Hillary Clinton. McMullin didn\u2019t like either of them, but he was especially unsparing in his critique of Trump. In answer to a question about the foreign-policy challenges involving Russia, including its incessant hacking of U.S. government entities, McMullin zeroed in on the tactics of Vladimir Putin.\nEM: Putin and his government are clearly attacking our democracy. And they\u2019re attacking our democracy in the same way that they\u2019ve attacked the democracies in Europe. How did they do that? They, first, foment divisions. Often along racial and ethnic lines within a country. Then they promote and even fund and promote with rhetoric and with propaganda the campaigns of people who capitalize, politicians who then capitalize on those divisions and that hatred and that nationalism that inward facing ideology. And\u2026we\u2019re seeing that in Donald Trump. That\u2019s exactly what Putin has done in other countries in Europe and that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing though Trump in America.\nJC: So, just by what you just said there, Trump is either a witting or unwitting agent of Vladimir Putin?\nEM: Oh there\u2019s no question. There\u2019s absolutely no question.\nWhat McMullin described was chilling when he said it in September 2016, and it is even more chilling given what The Post is reporting now. The Russians weaponized our ongoing and unresolved racial tensions by filling the Facebook feeds of those susceptible to propaganda with incendiary garbage. Among the more than 3,000 Facebook ads handed over to Congress was one that \u201cfeatured photographs of an armed black woman \u2018dry firing\u2019 a rifle \u2014 pulling the trigger of the weapon without a bullet in the chamber, according to people familiar with the investigation.\u201d\n[ PODCAST: Is Trump a Putin agent? \u2018There\u2019s absolutely no question.\u2019 ]\n\u201cInvestigators believe the advertisement may have been designed to encourage African American militancy and, at the same time, to stoke fears within white communities, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the probe,\u201d the story goes on to note. \u201cBut the precise purpose of the ad remains unclear to investigators, the people said.\u201d\nBoth Facebook and Twitter say Kremlin-linked organizations used their platforms to try and influence voters during the 2016 election. Here's how. (The Washington Post) Fomenting racial and ethnic tensions, as McMullin warned, was easy for Trump, who ran the most racist, xenophobic and misogynistic campaign for president in recent memory. With Black Lives Matter protests happening before and during the presidential campaign, what better way to stoke white fears than through those Russian ads? Or through an agent like candidate Trump and his minions who barked that the equal-justice mantra \u201cis inherently racist.\u201d Or through presidential nominee Trump, who declared that \u201claw and order must be restored\u201d before white audiences in a twisted pitch for African American votes.\n[ Trump asked blacks, \u2018What the hell do you have to lose?\u2019 We now have their response. ]\nThose examples and more explain why I\u2019m not going to bother straining a muscle trying to figure out \u201cthe precise purpose\u201d of the Russian-bot-bought Facebook ads. It\u2019s as clear as those tiki torches burning in the night sky of Charlottesville.\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj\nSubscribe to Cape Up, Jonathan Capehart\u2019s weekly podcast", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jonathan capehart", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "jonathan capehart october", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "larry claffy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evan mcmullin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evelyn hockstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcmullin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert cohen/associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook and twitter", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ferguson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlottesville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mo.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:28:37.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42b4522202b66c0866419bdcf1090445bfd92d0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgW0izAs9LRh83zIpjFni_V7ila903mALaYYK41_wawzneOZQDJg23kdZPiDAuSgFT9kRTRntARYAuYqbMBYa.IsKe.vmZNaSkYqAPxgMIaSGwWoxajUuvhD_JjPjgTF_EgZ37cDxz5iJLVfjzirJ1GA--", "site_full": "www.washingtonpost.com", "site": "washingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.yardbarker.com/rss/team/30", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "Yardbarker: Washington Nationals", "title": "\u2018I d \u2019: Eireann Dolan and Nats reliever Sean Doolittle eloped", "title_full": "\u2018I d \u2019: Eireann Dolan and Nats reliever Sean Doolittle eloped", "published": "2017-10-03T18:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dc-sports-bog/files/2017/10/Doolittle2.png&amp;w=1484&amp;op=resize&amp;opt=1&amp;filter=antialias&amp;t=20170517", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 177, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 552, "comments": 0, "shares": 552}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "42b4522202b66c0866419bdcf1090445bfd92d0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgW0izAs9LRh83zIpjFni_V7ila903mALaYYK41_wawzneOZQDJg23kdZPiDAuSgFT9kRTRntARYAuYqbMBYa.IsKe.vmZNaSkYqAPxgMIaSGwWoxajUuvhD_JjPjgTF_EgZ37cDxz5iJLVfjzirJ1GA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T18:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u2018I d \u2019: Eireann Dolan and Nats reliever Sean Doolittle eloped", "text": "\u2014 Sean Doolittle (@whatwouldDOOdo) October 3, 2017 \nDoolittle and Dolan, both of whom have become fan favorites in D.C. over the last two months, followed each other on Twitter before they met.

What happened is, in many ways, a miracle,\u201d Trump said as he departed the White House for a trip to Puerto Rico on Tuesday morning. \u201cThe police department, they\u2019ve done such an incredible job.

They\u2019ve done an amazing job.\u201d\nAt least 59 people were killed and more than 500 others were injured in Las Vegas late Sunday when Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old retiree who lives in the area, opened fire on an outdoor country music festival from the windows of a 32nd-floor hotel suite. For at least five minutes, and perhaps as long as 15, bullets rained down on the concertgoers and the panicked crowd rushed to escape. As Paddock fired round after round, gun smoke filled the hotel suite and set off a fire alarm , allowing a SWAT team to zero in on Paddock\u2019s position in about 20 minutes. As officers closed in, Paddock killed himself.\n[ How the Las Vegas Strip shooting unfolded ]\nDespite the historic number of people killed, Trump has repeatedly stressed that the shooting could have been even worse.\nPresident Trump, standing alongside first lady Melania Trump, speaks to the media before departing the White House on Tuesday morning. (Jim Lo Scalzo/European Pressphoto Agency/EFE) \u201cI want to thank the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and all of the first responders for their courageous efforts, and for helping to save the lives of so many,\u201d Trump said in the hours after the shooting on Monday. \u201cThe speed with which they acted is miraculous and prevented further loss of life. To have found the shooter so quickly after the first shots were fired is something for which we will always be thankful and grateful. It shows what true professionalism is all about.\u201d\nAlthough Trump appeared open on Tuesday to talk about gun-control laws in the future, his administration has declined to discuss the issue in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders faced several questions on gun-control policies on Oct. 2 after a shooting in Las Vegas left at least 58 people dead. (Reuters) \u201cThere's a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a press briefing on Monday. \u201cThere is currently an open and ongoing law enforcement investigation. A motive is yet to be determined. And it would be premature for us to discuss policy when we don't fully know all the facts, or what took place last night.\u201d\n[ Amid mass shootings, GOP-controlled Congress remains focused on loosening gun laws ]\nSanders said that when gun-control is eventually debated, the administration will \u201cneed to look at things that may actually have that real impact,\u201d noting that Chicago has \u201cthe strictest gun laws in the country\u201d yet still sees thousands of gun-related crimes committed each year.

By Amber Phillips By Amber Phillips October 3 at 10:23 AM Follow byamberphillips President Trump was asked about the gun laws on Oct. 3, in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting. \"We have a tragedy, and what happened in Las Vegas is in many ways a miracle,\" he said. \"We'll be talking about gun laws as time goes by.\" (The Washington Post) \nWith this president, no policy position is sacred. But if Trump decided to support gun-control laws after Las Vegas, it would be truly surprising. \nThat's because Trump was one of the most vociferous pro-gun presidential candidates that gun-rights proponents can remember. \nEven though Trump the Businessman supported an assault weapons ban, Trump the Politician has been unabashedly pro-gun. He repeatedly promised the Second Amendment is \u201cvery very safe\u201d with him. \nHe once said at a campaign rally that maybe \u201cSecond Amendment people \u201d can do something about Hillary Clinton. After the June 2016 Orlando shooting, he indicated he was taking his gun policy cues on how to react from the NRA. I will be meeting with the NRA, who has endorsed me, about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no fly list, to buy guns. \nThe National Rifle Association spent some $50 million in the presidential election , for him and against Clinton. One of the first bills he signed into law was an obscure one that made it easier for people the government deems mentally incapable of managing their affairs to get guns . A couple months later, he became the first president since Ronald Reagan to speak at the NRA's annual conference. \n\u201cYou came through for me, and I am going to come through for you,\u201d he said. President Trump addressed the National Rifle Association annual conference in Atlanta on April 28. \"You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you,\" Trump said to cheers. (The Washington Post) \nTrump seems to believe what the NRA and conservative pundits assume: The NRA's support helped him win the election. The Center for Responsive Politics estimates the NRA spent more than $30 million attacking Clinton and other Democratic candidates in the presidential election. \nFred Barnes, executive editor of the Weekly Standard, points out the group ran an expensive October ad of a woman who says her pistol saved her life from an attacker. The ad started running the same week the devastating Access Hollywood tape broke all the way through the World Series at the end of the month. The NRA was one of the first major interest groups to endorse him and one of the few groups to stand by him. \n\u201cThe NRA did just about everything right,\u201d Barnes wrote. \nPolicy consistency is not Trump's strong suit. Nor, necessarily, is loyalty. (See all his top aides who have lost their jobs so far.) \nBut Trump is consistent on one thing: hugging his base. On guns, he hugged his base hard. And he has yet to let go. \n\u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters, okay?\u201d he once said during the campaign, in a reference to his loyal base. \u201cIt\u2019s like incredible.\u201d [ Gun control advocates push back a tough year at the state level, and they'll take the win. ] \nTrump certainly has the ability to buck his own party. Last month, he struck a \u201cdeal\u201d to protect \u201cdreamers\u201d from deportation with \u201cChuck and Nancy,\u201d as he likes to call the Democratic congressional leaders \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.). \nBut I put \u201cdeal\u201d in quotes because so far, there is no tangible legislation to protect dreamers. [ Trump's bipartisan kick seems less than sincere ] \nAnd while some Republicans in Congress are amenable to immigration reform, very few want to cross the line to support gun control bills. The polling just isn't there . \nThat helps explain why Congress is moving to loosen, not tighten, gun laws . A bill that would make it easier to buy silencers to muffle the sound of guns firing is moving through the House. Another piece of legislation on the gun-control lobby's wish list is a bill to require states to acknowledge another state's conceal-carry permit, effectively making the entire United States on par with some states' loosest gun laws. \nThose gun-rights bills have been stalled by mass shootings, not any political force. The silencer legislation was scheduled for a hearing the summer day a gunman fired on Republican members of Congress and lobbyists at an Alexandria baseball field. It eventually got its hearing and made it out of committee, and The Post's Mike DeBonis now reports it's been put on hold in the wake of Las Vegas. \nOn Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tried to make a connection between Chicago's gang violence and the city's gun-control laws, an indication of where the president might lean after Las Vegas. \nWhen asked about all this by reporters Tuesday morning, Trump was noncommittal: \u201cWe'll be talking about gun laws as time goes by,\u201d he said. \nIf he's talking about anything other than support for gun rights, it would be a remarkable about-face, even for him.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ronald reagan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barnes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah huckabee sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike debonis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump the businessman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles e. schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014 donald j. trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred barnes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national rifle association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weekly standard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nra", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifth avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:38:33.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b471e8fe10bbe24e3390c327fdce1b8d2c239a3b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgW0izAs9LRh_w5EEtnHGSiFsUpbcVTs4BN_6q9SyvoLJ1wPB.0_ovsqTu2.LySlSYFUyYqIOOm_GPIhXFSG3q6lrmUA9X71Zgfx0zlOG3tbTtrGoTGYCPgkvbijTEHAeON7fx3IwTVHoJ7IPYokHlPxiNB2iGIWoW2Q3IMca_D9xGMnBiNqc2Iw--", "site_full": "www.washingtonpost.com", "site": "washingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/rss/linkset/2005/03/24/LI2005032400102.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "Washington Post: Breaking News, World, US, DC News & Analysis", "title": "Las Vegas shooting: Investigators find arsenal of guns but no motive", "title_full": "Las Vegas shooting: Investigators find arsenal of guns but no motive - The Washington Post", "published": "2017-10-03T19:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8dsvhaOyTndvAOHlsUNh0YQOqNA=/1484x0/https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KCN6XYUNEIZLDN65NFAFTY7RWU.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 177, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e1f69e1239a33128d00e7b2496b507f322364918", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQwU97HLU2a07uKU_WMx1OgW0izAs9LRh_w5EEtnHGSiFsUpbcVTs4BN_6q9SyvoLJ1wPB.0_ovsqTu2.LySlSYFUyYqIOOm_GPIhXFSG3q6lrmUA9X71Zgfx0zlOG3tbTtrGoTGYCPgkvbijTEHAeON7fx3IwTVHoJ7IPYokHlPxiNB2iGIWoW2Q3IMca_D9znJtTLPDtnBQ--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Jose Jimenezz", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "Don't \\\"buy\\\" the \\\"official story\\\" being trotted out by mainstream media.
