There were no functional improvements in this update. \nAndroid device makers have the option to address issues listed in the Pixel/Nexus bulletin, but don't need to fix them to state their devices are up to date with the latest patch level. \n\"Security vulnerabilities that are documented in [the Android] security bulletin are required to declare the latest security patch level on Android devices. Additional security vulnerabilities that are documented in device\u200a/\u200apartner security bulletins are not required for declaring a security patch level,\" Google explains in a Q&A section about the new bulletin . \nPresumably this move is to help Android devices makers fix the most important bugs more quickly. Notably, none of the bugs in the Pixel/Nexus bulletin is rated as \"critical\". \nGoogle counts the Pixel/Nexus bulletin as a 'device/partner' bulletin like the monthly security bulletins from Samsung and LG. \nSamsung has already published its October bulletin, detailing Google patches from the Android security bulletin, and six further flags affecting Samsung devices. The company in September launched its mobile bug bounty , offering researchers between $200 and $200,000 for reporting bugs affecting select Galaxy handsets and tablets. \nThe 2017-10-01 patch level also has a fix for the masqdns Domain Name System (DNS) software that affected a number of Google's own services and the Google-created Kubernetes containerization automation software.

So I think this is a good time for a brief refresher on this topic.\nIn my opinion, the state of UEFI firmware configuration today is still pretty chaotic - as far as I can tell every OEM has their own peculiar way of handling UEFI configuration, and the differences between them are anything but trivial.\nInstalling Linux on your PC is super easy - here's how to do it\nI will show that it's possible to install, configure, and use this Linux distribution with absolutely no command-line access.\nRead More\nEven worse, in some cases in my own direct experience, different systems from the same OEM have completely different UEFI configuration procedures. So if you have come here looking for simple answers and cookbook procedures, you're going to be disappointed.\nThe first level of UEFI configuration is the basic choice of whether you want UEFI Secure Boot enabled or not.\nSecure Boot is supposed to be one of the major reasons for the existence of UEFI firmware - but in my opinion it is a ridiculously complex solution for a problem that the vast majority of PC users would never be faced with. The idea is to certify the boot image(s) on your computer, so that evil-doers can not corrupt or replace them, and thereby penetrate your system.\nWhat this means is that if you have UEFI Secure Boot enabled, you can only boot a certified signed image - and at least in the original UEFI specification, the only signing authority was Microsoft. I will leave the debate about the wisdom of that decision to others. All I will say here is that this decision had the effect of making installing Linux on UEFI firmware systems much more difficult.\nSome OEMs (and their firmware suppliers) have put considerable effort into providing an alternate means for installing keys, certificates and signed images so that their users have at least some slim hope of regaining control of their computers. But in my opinion so far these have been difficult to understand and difficult to use, at best.\nOn the other hand, some Linux distributions have tried to adapt to UEFI firmware with Secure Boot by including a signed image in their installation. Off the top of my head, I think openSUSE and Ubuntu do this, and I suppose there are some others. They can do it either by getting their own boot images signed by Microsoft, or by producing a complete alternate signing authority, and getting the UEFI firmware to accept that authority and its signed images.\nAlthough this might provide an adequate solution for the few distributions which are willing and have the resources to do it, it doesn't help the vast majority of distributions who don't have the time, resources or interest to get it done.\nTherefore my personal choice is to simply disable UEFI Secure Boot. Note carefully, I am saying I disable Secure Boot only - not disable UEFI boot entirely, or return to Legacy (MBR) boot. I actually like working with the implementation of UEFI boot in general, I find it to be more flexible and considerably more robust than the old MBR boot process.\nSo the first question that I want to address here is how to disable Secure Boot in the UEFI firmware configuration. Unfortunately, as I alluded to above, the answer to this question is neither simple nor consistent.\nThe first step is fairly easy, and is almost always the same on all systems. To get into UEFI firmware configuration, you press F2 (or sometimes ESC) during the boot sequence. This is the same as it has generally been for Legacy BIOS configuration.\nOnce you get into UEFI/BIOS configuration, you will see a menu with a number of options such as \"Main Advanced Boot Security Save & Exit\". Following are two examples of such menus, from systems that I have here on hand:\nASUS R414S UEFI Configuration Menu\nImage: J.A. Watson Acer Aspire V3 UEFI Configuration Menu\nImage: J.A. Watson Other OEMs will certainly have somewhat different configuration menus, so keep an open mind when looking at these.\nWithin these menus, you want to find something about \"Secure Boot\", \"Secure Boot Processing\" or something similar to that. It is typically in either the Boot menu or the Security menu. When you find it, you want to select it and set it to Disabled or Off .\nIf you have an Acer computer, when you try to do this you will probably get your first surprise. You can't change the Secure Boot setting, at least at first -- it simply won't be possible to select it for editing. It turns out that you must have a \"Supervisor Password\" set in the UEFI configuration in order to change the Secure Boot mode. But it doesn't actually tell you this anywhere. Sigh. In this case, once you set a password you will then be able to change Secure Boot from Enabled to Disabled .\nOnce you have disabled Secure Boot, you are halfway home in getting Linux installed and working. You should now be able to boot the installation media for any Linux distribution which supports UEFI firmware (which is just about all of them now).\nAlthough I mentioned this briefly above, I didn't explain it in much detail.\nMost Linux distributions today support UEFI installation, but not Secure Boot. What that means in practical terms is that if you have a UEFI firmware system with Secure Boot enabled, and you try to boot the installation CD/DVD/USB media of a Linux distributions that does not support Secure Boot, what will happen is that your installation media will simply not be listed in the boot menu. Once you disable Secure Boot in the UEFI configuration, your installation media will then be listed.\nOnce your installation media is recognized and listed in the boot menu, you should be able to go through the installation process for whatever distribution you are using without much trouble. The next trick comes when you try to reboot to the installed system.\nThe problem here relates to how the boot sequence list gets modified. That list specifies what order the various boot objects should be tried, until one which meets the boot requirements is found and is successfully booted. I have seen three different situations in this area:\nThe boot priority list can be modified by software, as it should be, and everything just works with no fuss. Current Linux installers assume that this is the case, and they do what is necessary to set up the installed Linux system as the primary boot object, and any other installed operating systems (such as Windows or other Linux distributions) as dual-boot / multi-boot options. The UEFI firmware ignores attempts at modifying the boot priority list by software. In this case, the Linux installation appears to work normally, but when you have finished and you try to reboot to the installed system, it just boot Windows again, the same as it always has. There is usually a temporary work-around for this, you can try pressing the \"boot selection\" key - if you can figure out which one it is. On my Acer systems it is F12; on my ASUS systems it is ESC, and I believe on the HP systems I used to have it was something like F9 or F10. Whatever. If you find the correct key, you should be presented with a list of bootable objects on your computer; if the problem is simply that Linux wasn't able to change the boot sequence, then you will see a Linux installation listed there, and you can select it in order to boot Linux. The boot priority list can be modified by software, so it appears that the installation works and you might even be able to boot the installed Linux system the first time you try. But at some point after that, the OEMs boot software will decide to \"help you\", by correcting the \"mistake\" that you made in changing the default boot to anything other than Windows. When this happens your computer will suddenly start booting Windows by default, for no apparent reason, and you will have to go back to point 2 above for the temporary solution to boot Linux again. I have seen HP laptops do this many, many times, and this is the main reason (almost the only reason) that I quit buying HP computers altogether. If you have situation number 1 above, you are a happy person and the world is a wonderful place, so you can stop reading this long-winded article now. If you have situation two or three (or some other that I haven't seen yet, but which also is causing Linux installation/boot not to work), then you need a solution. Read on.\nThe most common solution/work-around for either case two or three is that the OEM and/or UEFI firmware supplier have provided a means in the UEFI configuration menus for you to manually specify the boot objects, priorities and/or sequence. To accomplish this, you have to get to the UEFI/BIOS configuration menu again, by pressing F2 during boot.\nIn the Configuration menus, look for the BOOT page, where you should find a list of boot object something like these:\nASUS UEFI BOOT Menu\nImage: J.A. Watson Acer UEFI BOOT Menu\nImage: J.A. Watson The important thing to notice in these pictures is that there is a list of boot objects, which will be tried in the order that they are listed, and that there are instructions on the right side of the screen about how to modify this list.\nThese two systems illustrate the most common methods I have seen so far.\nOn the ASUS, it lists every bootable operating system that is currently defined and present, and you can simply move items up and down the list to alter the priority, or to change which one will be booted by default.\nOn the Acer it only lists one \"object\" of each type - something to boot from the hard drive, the built-in CD/DVD, the Network, the USB ports and so on. To change the priority of different operating systems on the hard drive, you have to first select Hard Drive Priority, which will then bring up a new view that shows all of the known operating systems installed on the hard drive:\nAcer UEFI Hard Disk Boot Priority Menu\nImage: J.A. Watson In this screen you can change the order of the operating systems, which then sets to sequence in which they will be tried until one of them boots.\nThe last thing I want to mention, briefly, is that there is also a Linux CLI command which should be able to set the UEFI boot sequence, called efibootmgr . First, for those who are either allergic to or terrified of the command line, I want to stress that it is not necessary to use this command, this is an optional approach.\nIf you have a system which matches case 1 above, meaning that the UEFI boot table and sequence can be successfully and permanently set by software, then this command can be quite useful - especially if you are setting up a dual-boot or multi-boot system. Using it, you can quickly and easily change what operating system boots by default, for example.\nIf you have a system which is case two or three above, you still might be able to use this command to configure your UEFI boot sequence - but I would recommend trying to do it via the UEFI configuration menu as I just described.\nI can tell you from experience that it is very frustrating to spend the time getting the boot list just the way you want it with this command, and then reboot the system and find that nothing you did really had any effect anyway.\nThere is one final case that I should mention. When you are installing a Linux distribution as the only operating system on your UEFI-firmware system, in my experience it is very likely to work properly, the first time, without requiring any additional manual configuration.\nSo, that's a brief overview of UEFI and Linux as I deal with it today. I apologize again for it being so vague, but that is exactly the way things are on my computers today.\nIf you are very lucky, when you install Linux the UEFI boot sequence will just work as it should, and you won't have to worry about any of this. If you are not lucky, then the most important thing when you try to solve the problem is to keep an open mind, look carefully at the UEFI configuration options, and read the Help/Information text found at the right side of most items carefully.\nGood luck!\nPrevious and related coverage Hands On: Keeping a very old laptop useful with Linux\nMy Lenovo T400 was already old when I bought it as a refurb four years ago.

And if there are two things I never want to put together on a phone, it's bound to be glass and slippery. A glass back is bound to break when dropped, and it's expensive to replace . That said, I'm never one to use cases for more than a day or two, and I don't plan on doing so with the iPhone 8. Performance \nAs is typically the case with each new iPhone, Apple also introduced a new A-series processor. The A11 Bionic boasts six cores, four are dedicated to common tasks such as checking email and browsing the web. The remaining two cores are designed to maximize performance, in particular during graphics intensive processes such as gaming and augmented reality. \nThe four efficiency cores of the A11 Bionic provide the same computing power as Apple's A8 chip, but at one-third of the required power. \nReviewing devices and quantifying performance gains is always a delicate balance of expressing daily use and perceived speed boosts. I mentioned in my initial hands-on with the new iPhones felt faster, and that I planned on going back to the iPhone 7 Plus to verify. \nI've done just that, and the difference is even more pronounced. The iPhone 8 is much, much faster than the previous generation iPhone and it's not even close. \nAlso: Everything you need to know about charging your iPhone 8 | iPhone 8 Plus costs $295.44 to make | As expected, the iPhone 8 breaks if you drop it (but it's better than the Samsung Note 8) | iPhone 8, iPhone X vs Android flagships: Speed tests say it's not even close \nMy one gripe about overall performance is more focused on iOS 11 than it is on the iPhone 8 itself. I have experienced issues with the device soft restarting itself after interacting with notifications from the lock screen, as well as random instances of screen rotation not properly working. \nI'm currently running iOS 11.0.1 on the iPhone 8, and plan on installing the public beta of iOS 11.1 after this review is live for further testing. \nI experienced the same issues on my iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 8, so I know it's not specific to one device. Augmented Reality \nSpeaking of performance, with the release of iOS 11 Apple has added augmented reality capabilities to millions of devices around the world. The iPhone 8 lineup is the first set of Apple devices built with this feature in mind. \nI used and tested several AR apps during my time with the iPhone 8, and found it as fascinating and impressive as it is boring. \nDon't get me wrong, the ability to accurately measure a room or object using my phone's camera is something I once scoffed at being possible. But the current state of augmented apps and games in the App Store is an abundance of single-use scenarios. \nTake the IKEA app that lets you place different furniture and household items in a living space to get an idea of how it would look. It's neat, but once you have the furniture, you're not likely to go back into the app and shop for another couch. That'd be far too expensive. \nStar and planet mapping app Sky Guide is, thus far, the only app I can see myself and others coming back to time and time again. The app has always mapped out the sky above, including constellations, planets, and stars. With the release of iOS 11, however, Sky Guide now precisely overlays the exact location of each item using AR. It's fascinating and educational. \nI think my complaints about the current state of AR on iOS boils down to using a smartphone as the screen. Holding up a phone and looking at alien robots battling for supremacy on my kitchen table while walking in circles, pinching and zooming on a small screen to move objects limited and cumbersome. \nNow, if Apple were to build a pair of augmented reality glasses I could control with my voice and use gestures to manipulate objects in front of me as it overlaid objects, well, I think that would be intriguing. \nI'm not trying to take away from what Apple has done with iOS 11 and bringing augmented reality to users who would not otherwise seek it out will only help push AR apps and use cases into the mainstream. I just think there's a lot more work to be done before it goes beyond single use cases. Battery life and wireless charging \nBattery life of the iPhone 8 matches my experience with the iPhone 7 before it. With the iPhone 8, powering through an entire day of use isn't unreasonable. On days of particularly heavy use, the need to charge for a few minutes isn't unusual. \nThe real news with the iPhone 8 lineup in relation to the battery is the addition of wireless and fast charging. There are two wireless charging standards, Qi and PMA. Apple adopted the former standard for the iPhone 8 and iPhone X. Meaning, any current Qi wireless charging pad should work with the new iPhones. \nTo be clear, it's not a completely wireless solution. The pad still needs to have power running to it, so there's a cord involved. However, to charge an iPhone, you only need to place it on the charging pad and it will begin charging. \nAn iPhone 8 Plus charging in RAVPower's Fast Wireless Charging Pad. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet \nApple included Belkin's BoostUp charging pad with my review units, and I also used RAVPower's Fast Wireless Charging Pad during my time with the devices. Both pads have a status light to let you know when a phone is placed on it to indicate it's charging, and are capable of providing up to 7.5W of charging power. Currently, however, Apple has limited the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus to 5W wireless charging. \nA future software update, potentially iOS 11.1, will enable faster wireless charging of 7.5W. \nIn other words, right now both iPhones charge at the same rate as the Lightning connector and wall adapter that's included with the phones. \nWireless charging is one of these features I've always enjoyed using with Android devices for the simple fact that it's seamless. Place your phone down and it charges. You don't have to think about it. \nFor example, on my desk is a wireless charging pad. It's where I place my phone - regardless of type - when I'm working. I no longer think about where the phone goes, and a side effect of something I naturally do is that it charges any compatible phone. And now the iPhone is added to the list of devices that will stay charged. \nAlongside the new iPhones Apple announced its own charging pad. The AirPower Mat won't begin shipping until early 2018, but it adds support for charging three devices at once - something current Qi pads lack. Apple will begin selling a new wireless charging compatible case for AirPods, and the Apple Watch Series 3 is compatible with Qi charging to use with the AirPower Mat.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "belkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason cipriani/zdnet  apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ikea", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:21:38.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "994ddc3fdf5e26d8551e7a7439b4876139597ed3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmENskYR.sjY9l8S3qGNmSj3vTsErca3iN2wpoidjNkx43N_pQsyW7zI0JoIUUDLvFHQzjyNiNy.I", "site_full": "www.zdnet.com", "site": "zdnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.zdnet.com/topic/mobility/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Latest topics for ZDNet in Mobility", "title": "The best apps to earn you extra money on the go", "title_full": "The best apps to earn you extra money on the go", "published": "2017-10-03T11:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/02/0a527b81-fd92-42c3-8565-00b311943539/thumbnail/770x578/568467205b0d6d26d562dc4c20cbc6bf/screen-shot-2017-10-02-at-18-29-00.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1869, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "994ddc3fdf5e26d8551e7a7439b4876139597ed3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmENskYR.sjY9l8S3qGNmSj3vTsErca3iN2wpoidjNkx43N_pQsyW7zI0JoIUUDLvFHQzjyNiNy.I", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T11:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The best apps to earn you extra money on the go", "text": "Published: October 3, 2017 -- 08:00 GMT (09:00 BST) \nCaption by: Charlie Osborne JustPark \nJustPark allows you to rent out your spare parking space, garage, or driveway.

How CEO Satya Nadella answered the tech giant's existential question Microsoft's first product showed the way to reshape the company's future. \n\"We create technology so others can create technology,\" says Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Image: iStock \nWhen Satya Nadella became CEO of Microsoft in 2014 he asked a big question: why did the company need to exist? \nMicrosoft had for decades held onto a clear vision: to put a Windows PC on every desk. But long before he took the top job, this mission was largely accomplished (and increasingly less relevant in a world of smartphones and cloud computing). So the question was, what to do next? Read More \n\"When I joined Microsoft in 1992, we used to talk about a PC in every home and on every desk as our mission. It was tangible, clear, succinct and very empowering because it was clear what the company was for and what we were trying to get done,\" said Nadella, speaking in London last week. \n\"Even by the late 90s, at least in the developed world, we had achieved that and after that it was a bit unclear: what is our purpose? So that's why I thought it was important for me in 2014 to ask the question, the existential question: why does Microsoft exist? And then try to answer it crisply for myself and all of us.\" \nPerhaps unexpectedly, Nadella said to get that answer he went back to the very first product that Microsoft created, a Basic interpreter for the Altair 8800 . \n\"And right there is everything about who we are, which is: we create technology so others can create technology,\" he said. \n\"Empowering people and organisations all over the planet to achieve more. Every one of those is a key word for us. It's not about our technology, it's about what other people can do with our technology.\" \n\"I wanted us to get back to that sense of purpose. A lot has happened since the Altair, we can't say 'let's get back to the roots and build a Basic interpreter for the Altair', but [for] the quantum computer, we can build the development tools,\" he said. \nChanging the famously hard-charging culture at Microsoft has not been easy, he acknowledges. For example he had to introduce a book on 'non-violent' communication to Microsoft's leadership team as a way to encourage them to communicate better. \nPart of the problem was that the executives had previously been sent on a course about asking 'precision questions'. \n\"The idea was to destroy anybody's idea in the first five minutes by asking these highly precise analytical questions to disrupt the speaker's hypothesis. Which is actually a very useful analytical tool to have, but it was being used as an instrument of offence,\" Natella said. \n\"So this is one of the reasons I said that if we are going to be an effective leadership team, we will have to practice this non-violent communication.\" A growth mindset \nInstead, Nadella wants to creating a 'growth mindset' in the company culture, despite the considerable cynicism around such projects. \n\"There was a private equity guy who once told me 'The only culture I like is in my youghurt'. [But] if you don't recognise that culture is the ingredient that you need in order to drive your top line and bottom line, I think you'll think more clearly after your first success,\" he said, but admitted: \"One of my biggest worries of this book and even talking about is will it be viewed cynically as just corporate propaganda.\" \nNadella is also a big believer in the use of empathy in business, arguing it can create a better understanding of what customers really need. He was in London promoting his book Hit Refresh , about his attempt to 'rediscover Microsoft's soul'. \n\"When I think about our business, at the core of it we have to drive innovation that meets the unmet, unarticulated needs of customers. That's it. If you want to be able to achieve business success you've got to get that right,\" he said. \n\"You can't just say 'We'll listen to customers and do what they ask us to do' because that's not what they really want you to do. They want you to get beyond their words and get in touch with their real needs. That requires in my opinion the deepest sense of empathy. Now the real challenge is, you can't go to work and say 'let me switch on that empathy button and be great at business'.\" \nIn terms of technology, Nadella said that augmented reality, artificial intelligence and quantum computing will be key areas of focus. \n\"Mixed reality is the ultimate computer or computing experience. Your field of view is the combination of analogue and digital.\" \n\"That's the world we are going towards when we talk about the early forms of virtual reality: augmented reality -- that's why we think of it as mixed reality. It's a dial which you will be able to turn: 'I want to be fully immersed in something' or 'I want to see the real world with artificial objects', so we are building towards it.\" \n\"I think it will change collaboration, it will change commerce, it will change the notion of what presence is. Design and collaboration are being fundamentally transformed,\" Nadella added. \nNadella said that mixed reality and AI are still in their early stages, while quantum computing is still at the research stage. But he added: \"What is going to be key for us as a company is to take these three technologies and apply them with our sense of purpose: how do we go and solve some of the pressing problems of the world? That's how I feel about technology and our purpose.\" Previous and related coverage ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satya nadella", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "nadella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "natella", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:08:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e17c7717bbadcfb10cc6492593f439a6024627ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmNJj7p0ZI8H0UgdM2LDzqA8fHSTI3DlnlJ06nUA_joaX5SETVuexkfH.20RxRDkRbjtU95prFoAcuWYTFXmVcrWJBTEghyrx8qHT0U7xmiGc", "site_full": "www.zdnet.com", "site": "zdnet.com", "site_section": "http://zdnet.com//news/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Latest news", "title": "Google AI vs Siri vs Bing: IQ tests show one is smartest by a mile", "title_full": "Google AI vs Siri vs Bing: IQ tests show one is smartest by a mile", "published": "2017-10-03T15:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/03/9c50a6e4-fd68-4fc2-9b94-a460e607eade/thumbnail/770x578/318395d77c7146ad28fc2202aef24b99/ios-siri-mac-mac-os.jpg", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 1869, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 467, "comments": 0, "shares": 467}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 647}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e17c7717bbadcfb10cc6492593f439a6024627ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmNJj7p0ZI8H0UgdM2LDzqA8fHSTI3DlnlJ06nUA_joaX5SETVuexkfH.20RxRDkRbjtU95prFoAcuWYTFXmVcrWJBTEghyrx8qHT0U7xmiGc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google AI vs Siri vs Bing: IQ tests show one is smartest by a mile", "text": "Read More \nGoogle's score is slightly below a six-year-old human's IQ of 55.5, but more than double Siri's IQ of 23.9. By their measure, Siri is not as smart as Microsoft's Bing or Baidu, which have respective IQs of 31.98 and 32.92. All AI's IQs are significantly less than an average 18-year-old's 97 IQ. \nAn IQ evaluation of several search engines in 2014 by two of the three researchers found Google had an IQ of 26.5 compared with Baidu's 23.5. \n\"The results so far indicate that the artificial-intelligence systems produced by Google, Baidu, and others have significantly improved over the past two years but still have certain gaps as compared with even a six-year-old child,\" they write in a new paper published on ArXiv . \nThe researchers also propose a model for grading the intelligence of AI systems and assessing technology in the context of the threat it poses to humans. Their model unifies AI and human characteristics around four areas of knowledge, including \"input, output, mastery, and creation\". \nThe AI intelligence model ranges from a first-grade system, which can't exchange information with humans, to an almighty God-like sixth-grade system feared by Elon Musk, which \"continuously innovates and creates new knowledge, with I/O ability, knowledge mastery, and application ability that all approach infinite values as time goes on\". \nFirst-grade AI systems have the same capacity for information-related interaction with humans as stones, while second-grade systems include smart TVs and washing machines that can control program information but lack the ability to learn automatically. \nThe third class include computers and mobile phones, which can be programmed and upgraded, while fourth-grade systems include Google Brain, Baidu Brain, and the EU's RoboEarth robots , due to the ability to adapt based on information exchanged in the cloud. \nHumans, they argue, can be regarded as possessing \"special\" naturally occurring AI that conforms to fifth-grade intelligence due to their capacity for creativity, which all systems in lower grades lack. \nIn this scheme, the researchers argue that AlphaGo, from Google-parent Alphabet's DeepMind, would be a third-grade system, in part because it's still in the R&D phase. Also, despite beating humans at Go with exotic strategies, it can't be considered as having creativity since its still relies on humans for training. \n\"If humans did not provide help to the program, and AlphaGo could obtain Go chess data on its own initiative, self-program, and simulate game contests to gain experience for changing its training model to win games in real contests, it might be more defensible to say that AlphaGo could innovate,\" they write. \n\"However, as AlphaGo does not appear capable of such a development process, from a comprehensive point of view its intelligence rating is of the third grade, which is two grades lower than that of humans.\" Previous and related coverage", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "siri", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elon musk", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "baidu", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:08:45.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3ca2f598da0784b301f7e11d8193ee74d8ded2c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmNJj7p0ZI8H0JEQWdKErUUsMKcNhslgjx9.tpSbWGhr8._xTBGJDT0e4A81kTSiYdXcuhTAzt0nS.cl3vItL4I3JbA2s9UI9yKnH5TQQxOILLTXpk7EKn1zORvZ2_VM77bfRLvKJ1MQ7T70sh9O27qmHCqIspDydDQ--", "site_full": "www.zdnet.com", "site": "zdnet.com", "site_section": "http://zdnet.com//news/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Latest news", "title": "AMD unveils E9170 embedded GPU, offering 3X Performance-Per-Watt for low-power embedded applications", "title_full": "AMD unveils E9170 embedded GPU, offering 3X Performance-Per-Watt for low-power embedded applications", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/03/a98a28b1-ad32-4218-b8eb-27adca12b665/thumbnail/770x578/cf73fc593ce977e251f7af116dcf5f00/008.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1869, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 14, "comments": 0, "shares": 14}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 54}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3ca2f598da0784b301f7e11d8193ee74d8ded2c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmNJj7p0ZI8H0JEQWdKErUUsMKcNhslgjx9.tpSbWGhr8._xTBGJDT0e4A81kTSiYdXcuhTAzt0nS.cl3vItL4I3JbA2s9UI9yKnH5TQQxOILLTXpk7EKn1zORvZ2_VM77bfRLvKJ1MQ7T70sh9O27qmHCqIspDydDQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "AMD unveils E9170 embedded GPU, offering 3X Performance-Per-Watt for low-power embedded applications", "text": "ZDNet Japan AMD unveils E9170 embedded GPU, offering 3X Performance-Per-Watt for low-power embedded applications The new Radeon E9170 offers support for up to five 4K displays and comes in compact MCM, standard MXM and PCI Express card form factors. \nAMD Embedded Radeon E9173 GPU AMD \nAMD is releasing a new embedded Radeon GPU, the first to be based on the Polaris architecture. what's hot on zdnet Must read : iOS 11 battery life is terrible \nBut this one isn't aimed at the desktop or laptop markets, but instead it expands AMD's offerings in the digital casino games, thin clients, medical displays, retail and digital signage, and industrial systems markets. \nThe AMD Embedded Radeon E9173 GPU, based on the Polaris architecture, uses an optimized 14-nanometer FinFET manufacturing process to provide up to three times the performance-per-watt over previous generations of AMD Embedded GPUs. \nAnd the Radeon E9170 is quite a powerhouse, delivering up to 1.25 TFLOPS at sub-40W TDP board power, and includes 4K HEVC/H.265 and AVC/H.264 decode and encode support, 4K and 3D support, and is capable of driving up to five 4K displays using HDMI 2.0 and/or DisplayPort 1.4. \nAMD Embedded Radeon E9173 GPU AMD \nWith the Radeon E9173, AMD has its eye on penetrating deeper into the following markets: Digital casino games : Helping reduce energy consumption and operating costs, the E9170 Series GPU cuts down on operating costs for entry level and midrange casino gaming systems, as well as lowers thermal dissipation that impacts facility air conditioning costs. Support for five independent and simultaneous displays allows companies to create an eye-catching experience with more pixels and more action. DirectX 12 support enables higher frames per second and reduced latency, and cross-platform Vulkan API support helps ensure better image quality while decreasing CPU processing bottlenecks. Thin clients : Thin clients powered by the E9170 Series GPU can have a smaller hardware footprint than traditional PC systems, and can have lower heat output and provide cooler workspaces in densely-staffed and space-constrained environments such as stock exchange trading floors. Additionally, 4K graphics resolution provides crisp visual clarity when thin clients are in split-screen display mode, improving the end-user experience. Medical displays : The high-performance 4K graphics resolution in the E9170 Series GPU helps improve the accuracy of clinical diagnoses in X-Ray machines and ultrasounds as well as with bone tissue and analysis, helping medical professionals to enhance patient care.

Ed Brennen for UMass Lowell \nSalesforce on Tuesday is announcing a new version of Trailhead, its online learning platform, tailored for higher education. Cloud TV Read More \nThe cloud company is partnering with universities, community colleges, workforce development programs and educational nonprofits to roll out Trailhead for Students. The platform provides educators with a curriculum that can complement existing coursework or serve as standalone educational content for a classroom or \"bootcamp\" setting. It promises students an opportunity to build up skills that could potentially help them land a job after graduation, as well as opportunities to connect with other students and mentors. \nAs companies look for prospective employees with cloud skills, and as schools attempt to keep up their technology-focused curriculum, Salesforce saw a \"clear opportunity to make an impact on the digital skills gap,\" Lisa Tenorio, senior director of Trailhead, said to ZDNet. \nThe focus on education is a natural expansion of Trailhead, which was launched in 2014 to help Salesforce build out a workforce familiar with its cloud-based tools. The company points to a 2016 report from IDC, which Salesforce sponsored, projecting that the \"Salesforce ecosystem\" will create 2 million jobs by 2020. \nSo far, Salesforce is working with more than 70 educational partners to roll out the program, including University of Massachusetts Lowell, Year Up, Jewish Vocational Services (JVS) and University of San Francisco. \nWith Trailhead for Students, educators can get access to instructor kits, including the new Salesforce Essentials for Business Specialists course -- a course designed for educators and students across business and technology programs. Instructors can also use Trailhead as a tool in the classroom to track student progress and reinforce lectures through hands-on labs. \nStudents, meanwhile, can earn badges for building new skills, as all Trailhead users can, and they can join new student-led community groups with access to potential mentors from Salesforce. \nLike the rest of Trailhead, Trailhead for Students is available to educators and students for free. Some professional training courses are only available for a fee, Tenorio said, but the educator curriculum is available at no cost. \nThe University of Massachusetts-Lowell, which has been a Salesforce client for three years, joined the program and trained around 60 students and faculty in an online bootcamp over the summer. The campus also recently hosted a \"Salesforce day\" with hands-on training and lectures for students. It's also incorporating Trailhead for Students into existing courses during the Fall 2017 semester. \nSandy Richtermeyer, dean of the Manning School of Business at UMass Lowell, said accredited institutions are increasingly focused on building partnerships with industry to enhance students' learning experiences. Trailhead for Students is especially well-designed for teaching students \"current and relevant\" skills, she said, as opposed to textbooks that may only get updated every couple of years. \nSaleforce has also effectively demonstrated the impact of its technology across industries and fields like HR, marketing, finance, and operations management, Richtermeyer said. \n\"It's rare when you're trying to demonstrate technology and how it important it is that it goes across all these areas of business,\" she said. \"Students need to have an enterprise-wide lens to understand how the technology can be implemented.\" PREVIOUS AND RELATED COVERAGE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tenorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisa tenorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richtermeyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saleforce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandy richtermeyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed brennen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salesforce", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "zdnet japan salesforce", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "university of massachusetts lowell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umass lowell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zdnet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salesforce essentials for business specialists", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manning school of business", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of massachusetts-lowell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umass lowell  salesforce", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "trailhead", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:08:48.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "584c0e9ebb762ff4390f1d38952fd1279ce53362", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmFE2aQXco6W0dwzLvlOTNi7Ycp3ssFy.eupbFDqSlT5oUYN0.4zU7zUfD1Vs7dV87w--", "site_full": "www.zdnet.com", "site": "zdnet.com", "site_section": "http://technewsdata.com/feed", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Tech news data", "title": "iPhone 8 review: More of the same, but better in just about every way", "title_full": "iPhone 8 review: More of the same, but better in just about every way", "published": "2017-10-03T15:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://technewsdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/iphone-8-2-660x330.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1869, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 23, "comments": 0, "shares": 23}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "584c0e9ebb762ff4390f1d38952fd1279ce53362", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmFE2aQXco6W0dwzLvlOTNi7Ycp3ssFy.eupbFDqSlT5oUYN0.4zU7zUfD1Vs7dV87w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "techguy", "published": "2017-10-03T15:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "iPhone 8 review: More of the same, but better in just about every way", "text": "Home / iPhone / iPhone 8 review: More of the same, but better in just about every way iPhone 8 review: More of the same, but better in just about every way techguy 9 hours ago iPhone Leave a comment 5 Views \nApple\u2019s newest iPhone is here, available now. The iPhone 8 is a respectable improvement over last year\u2019s model but is overshadowed by the iPhone X, available later. It\u2019s difficult to look at a device that, from the outside, looks similar to iPhones of the past, with a futuristic looking iPhone X already unveiled. \nInstead of looking into the future, let\u2019s take a look at one of the iPhones Apple is shipping right now \u2013 the iPhone 8. \nCNET: Phone 8 review: The status quo upgrade \nIf you\u2019re looking for a review of the iPhone 8 Plus, you can find it here. There\u2019s a lot of overlap between the two devices, with this review focusing on those areas, and the 8 Plus review focusing on features specific to that device. Design Jason Cipriani/ZDNet \nFrom the front, the iPhone 8 looks identical to the iPhone 7 , and for that matter largely the same to the iPhone 6 and 6S before it. That means the same 4.7-inch display, with a physical home button on the bottom, and an earpiece along with sensor cutout along the top. The right side is the wake/unlock button, with the left side housing the volume up/down buttons as well as the mute switch. \nIt\u2019s not until you flip the phone over until and see the glass back that you truly realize the iPhone 8 isn\u2019t an older model. The iPhone 8 is so similar to the iPhone 7, in fact, that most iPhone 7 cases will work on the iPhone 8. Top ZDNET Reviews \nBy using a glass back, Apple not only slightly changed the look of a design that\u2019s quickly growing tired, but it enabled the company to add wireless charging (more on that in a bit). \nI find the glass back to be smooth, and somewhat slippery. And if there are two things I never want to put together on a phone, it\u2019s bound to be glass and slippery. A glass back is bound to break when dropped, and it\u2019s expensive to replace . That said, I\u2019m never one to use cases for more than a day or two, and I don\u2019t plan on doing so with the iPhone 8. Performance \nAs is typically the case with each new iPhone, Apple also introduced a new A-series processor. The A11 Bionic boasts six cores, four are dedicated to common tasks such as checking email and browsing the web. The remaining two cores are designed to maximize performance, in particular during graphics intensive processes such as gaming and augmented reality. \nThe four efficiency cores of the A11 Bionic provide the same computing power as Apple\u2019s A8 chip, but at one-third of the required power. \nReviewing devices and quantifying performance gains is always a delicate balance of expressing daily use and perceived speed boosts. I mentioned in my initial hands-on with the new iPhones felt faster, and that I planned on going back to the iPhone 7 Plus to verify. \nI\u2019ve done just that, and the difference is even more pronounced. The iPhone 8 is much, much faster than the previous generation iPhone and it\u2019s not even close. \nAlso: Everything you need to know about charging your iPhone 8 | iPhone 8 Plus costs $295.44 to make | As expected, the iPhone 8 breaks if you drop it (but it\u2019s better than the Samsung Note 8) | iPhone 8, iPhone X vs Android flagships: Speed tests say it\u2019s not even close \nMy one gripe about overall performance is more focused on iOS 11 than it is on the iPhone 8 itself. I have experienced issues with the device soft restarting itself after interacting with notifications from the lock screen, as well as random instances of screen rotation not properly working. \nI\u2019m currently running iOS 11.0.1 on the iPhone 8, and plan on installing the public beta of iOS 11.1 after this review is live for further testing. \nI experienced the same issues on my iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 8, so I know it\u2019s not specific to one device. Augmented Reality \nSpeaking of performance, with the release of iOS 11 Apple has added augmented reality capabilities to millions of devices around the world. The iPhone 8 lineup is the first set of Apple devices built with this feature in mind. \nI used and tested several AR apps during my time with the iPhone 8, and found it as fascinating and impressive as it is boring. \nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the ability to accurately measure a room or object using my phone\u2019s camera is something I once scoffed at being possible. But the current state of augmented apps and games in the App Store is an abundance of single-use scenarios. \nTake the IKEA app that lets you place different furniture and household items in a living space to get an idea of how it would look. It\u2019s neat, but once you have the furniture, you\u2019re not likely to go back into the app and shop for another couch. That\u2019d be far too expensive. \nStar and planet mapping app Sky Guide is, thus far, the only app I can see myself and others coming back to time and time again. The app has always mapped out the sky above, including constellations, planets, and stars. With the release of iOS 11, however, Sky Guide now precisely overlays the exact location of each item using AR. It\u2019s fascinating and educational. \nI think my complaints about the current state of AR on iOS boils down to using a smartphone as the screen. Holding up a phone and looking at alien robots battling for supremacy on my kitchen table while walking in circles, pinching and zooming on a small screen to move objects limited and cumbersome. \nNow, if Apple were to build a pair of augmented reality glasses I could control with my voice and use gestures to manipulate objects in front of me as it overlaid objects, well, I think that would be intriguing. \nI\u2019m not trying to take away from what Apple has done with iOS 11 and bringing augmented reality to users who would not otherwise seek it out will only help push AR apps and use cases into the mainstream. I just think there\u2019s a lot more work to be done before it goes beyond single use cases. Battery life and wireless charging \nBattery life of the iPhone 8 matches my experience with the iPhone 7 before it. With the iPhone 8, powering through an entire day of use isn\u2019t unreasonable. On days of particularly heavy use, the need to charge for a few minutes isn\u2019t unusual. \nThe real news with the iPhone 8 lineup in relation to the battery is the addition of wireless and fast charging. There are two wireless charging standards, Qi and PMA. Apple adopted the former standard for the iPhone 8 and iPhone X. Meaning, any current Qi wireless charging pad should work with the new iPhones. \nTo be clear, it\u2019s not a completely wireless solution. The pad still needs to have power running to it, so there\u2019s a cord involved. However, to charge an iPhone, you only need to place it on the charging pad and it will begin charging. \nAn iPhone 8 Plus charging in RAVPower\u2019s Fast Wireless Charging Pad. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet \nApple included Belkin\u2019s BoostUp charging pad with my review units, and I also used RAVPower\u2019s Fast Wireless Charging Pad during my time with the devices. Both pads have a status light to let you know when a phone is placed on it to indicate it\u2019s charging, and are capable of providing up to 7.5W of charging power. Currently, however, Apple has limited the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus to 5W wireless charging. \nA future software update, potentially iOS 11.1, will enable faster wireless charging of 7.5W. \nIn other words, right now both iPhones charge at the same rate as the Lightning connector and wall adapter that\u2019s included with the phones. \nWireless charging is one of these features I\u2019ve always enjoyed using with Android devices for the simple fact that it\u2019s seamless. Place your phone down and it charges. You don\u2019t have to think about it. \nFor example, on my desk is a wireless charging pad. It\u2019s where I place my phone \u2013 regardless of type \u2013 when I\u2019m working. I no longer think about where the phone goes, and a side effect of something I naturally do is that it charges any compatible phone. And now the iPhone is added to the list of devices that will stay charged. \nAlongside the new iPhones Apple announced its own charging pad. The AirPower Mat won\u2019t begin shipping until early 2018, but it adds support for charging three devices at once \u2013 something current Qi pads lack. Apple will begin selling a new wireless charging compatible case for AirPods, and the Apple Watch Series 3 is compatible with Qi charging to use with the AirPower Mat. \nAnother power-related feature Apple has added to the iPhone 8 is fast charging. With fast charging, the iPhone 8 can see as much as 50-percent of a charge in just 30 minutes. Keep in mind that\u2019s with a battery that\u2019s nearly drained, and when using Apple\u2019s 29W wall adapter and a USB-C to Lightning cable. Neither of which are included with the iPhone. \nFrustrating, no doubt. I happened to have a 29W wall adapter and the proper cable due to the iPad Pro lineup having fast charging, and I got tired of waiting several hours for my iPad to go from empty to full. Apple\u2019s estimates are accurate, with the average battery gain in 30 minutes being in line with the 50-percent estimate. \nThe cost to get a similar setup is a minimum of $75, depending on the length of the USB-C cable you buy. It\u2019s a shame Apple doesn\u2019t include the proper hardware in the box with each iPhone, as it\u2019s surely something users will benefit from and appreciate. \nFor now, at least, fast charging is an optional feature you\u2019re going to have to pay extra to use. Camera Jason Cipriani/ZDNet \nWith most people\u2019s main camera being the smartphone he or she always has nearby, it makes sense for Apple to continue to emphasize the updates it makes each year in this area. For this year, the iPhone 8 stays with a single 12-megapixel sensor. The FaceTime, or front-facing camera, is 7-megapixels. Don\u2019t let the numbers fool you, this isn\u2019t the same camera Apple used in the iPhone 7. \nThere\u2019s now a larger, faster sensor, with optical image stabilization for clearer pictures. Apple has also added a new flash and slow sync setup to better illuminate and capture objects in low light environments. There\u2019s also a new image signal processor built into Apple\u2019s A11 Bionic processor and Apple\u2019s own video encoder. \nAll of these terms, processors, and encoders combine to create the two best smartphone camera setups I\u2019ve personally used. Prior to using the iPhone 8 (and 8 Plus), my go to smartphone camera was the latest Samsung Galaxy device. Starting with the Galaxy S7, I felt the quality, color reproduction, and sharpness captured by Samsung\u2019s smartphones was superior to that of the iPhone lineup. \nWith the iPhone 8, I\u2019ve experienced consistent photo quality beyond what I can capture with Samsung\u2019s smartphone lineup. The amount of time to focus, the contrast, sharpness, and color replication have all been improved across the board. \nThe iPhone 8 Plus has a better camera than the iPhone 8 thanks it its dual camera setup and added software tricks, but it\u2019s only slightly. Anyone using an iPhone 8 to capture precious photos of kids growing up won\u2019t be disappointed with the results. Boring for some, new to others Jason Cipriani/ZDNet \nTake a faster processor, a slightly updated design, an improved camera, and some new charging tricks and it all adds up to the iPhone 8. But is it enough to persuade iPhone loyalists to stick with Apple? Or what about those Android users who are tempted by Apple\u2019s ecosystem and ease of use? \nI\u2019m not so sure. With the exception of wireless charging, Apple has used a similar recipe for the past four iPhone releases. A slight change here, improvement here, and bam a new iPhone. \nApple\u2019s approach has worked, but as I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s growing tired. \nWith the iPhone X, Apple has finally broken that mold and I think it\u2019s going to attract plenty of converts and loyalists alike. \nBut what if you\u2019re one of those who doesn\u2019t care for the iPhone X\u2019s design, or want something that costs $999 or more? The iPhone 8 is a worthwhile upgrade if you\u2019re coming from anything older than the iPhone 7. Those who have the iPhone 7, I\u2019d suggest either getting the iPhone X or waiting for next year\u2019s crop of devices. \nThe iPhone 8 starts at $699 for 64GB of storage, with a 256GB model upping the cost to $849.

Known security holes and vulnerabilities or ways for confidential information to be leaked, a lack of secure communication and encryption, and links to threat actors or countries known for spying campaigns can all be reasons for barring an app on corporate devices, alongside compliance issues. \nHowever, in the age of bring your own device (BYOD) schemes and corporately owned, personally enabled (COPE) platforms, it is not always possible to prevent app installation, but IT admins can at least prevent these applications from connecting to their networks. More security news Cloud vulnerabilities are being ignored by the enterprise \nAccording to Appthority, in Q3 2017, WhatsApp Messenger, Pok\u00e9mon GO, and WinZip were the top blacklisted apps for iOS, together with CamScanner. Poot-debug(W100).apk, an Android System Theme, Where's My Droid Pro, and weather software were the apps most likely to be banned on Android devices. \nThe report suggests that Android apps were usually blacklisted because malware was detected, and iOS apps were most likely to be banned due to data leakage risks, sending SMS messages -- not necessarily with consent -- or transferring data including GPS locations and sensitive information without encryption. \nAs a whole, tools for Android devices were banned most often, while social media and communication apps for iOS are treated with suspicion. \nAppthority says that based on \"mobile risk scores\" related to vulnerabilities and the risk of data leaks, Uber, WhatsApp Messenger, and Facebook Messenger are the riskiest Android apps commonly found in enterprise environments. \nFacebook, Pandora, and Yelp on the iOS platform are the most likely to cause a security breach. \n\"Enterprise security teams need to understand which mobile apps are being used, the risks they bring, and how their peers are utilizing mobile threat policies to more effectively secure corporate data,\" said Domingo Guerra, president of Appthority. \"With BYOD and COPE, many commonly used app-store approved apps are making their way into enterprises and posing risks to sensitive corporate data.\" \nIn July, Trend Micro and VMware announced a new partnership to tackle enterprise mobile security issues. The companies plan to create new solutions which will automatically detect and tackle mobile threats on corporate networks.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:18:32.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b2dccd4555ce5510f42386163e327bf21c45568", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmFE2aQXco6W0dwzLvlOTNi7Ycp3ssFy.ejWvXrHN7Qv6k4JkttL59sU-", "site_full": "www.zdnet.com", "site": "zdnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.zdnet.com/topic/mobility/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Latest topics for ZDNet in Mobility", "title": "iPhone 8 Plus Review: Bigger is better, but not for much longer", "title_full": "iPhone 8 Plus Review: Bigger is better, but not for much longer", "published": "2017-10-03T15:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/02/1a259ddd-bcfb-4f34-9ee6-d69e35c2ec9a/thumbnail/770x578/52e324a490a9deb72c580974fd9f7aab/iphone-8-plus.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1869, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 33, "comments": 0, "shares": 33}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 8}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b2dccd4555ce5510f42386163e327bf21c45568", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmFE2aQXco6W0dwzLvlOTNi7Ycp3ssFy.ejWvXrHN7Qv6k4JkttL59sU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "iPhone 8 Plus Review: Bigger is better, but not for much longer", "text": "Google Pixel XL 8.0 \nIn the same manner the iPhone 8 matches the design of its predecessors, so does the iPhone 8 Plus. Buttons, speakers, charging ports, and even the SIM card are all located in the same exact spot. \nMost cases for the iPhone 7 Plus will work on the 8 Plus, which is good news for those who upgrade each year and don't want to wait for the iPhone X . Battery life and performance \nThe iPhone 8 Plus uses the same A11 Bionic processor as the iPhone 8, with a total of six cores. Its battery is smaller than the iPhone 7 Plus, but thanks to A11 Bionic chip, the 8 Plus is more power efficient. \nI was able to get through over 36 hours of use from a single charge. On days of traveling and heavy use, I still had enough power to get to the end of the day without needing to recharge. Double the camera Jason Cipriani/ZDNet \nThe iPhone 8 Plus has two rear-facing cameras; one telephoto, and one wide-angle. Both are 12-megapixel sensors, with the FaceTime camera on the front being 7-megapixels. \nThe new cameras feature the same ISP and sensor improvements as the iPhone 8, but where it diverges from its smaller sibling is Portrait Mode. As with the iPhone 7 line, the bigger model leverages the two rear-facing cameras to add depth to photos without the need for expensive hardware and large lenses required by dedicated cameras. \nThe iPhone 8 Plus continues to blur the lines by adding depth -- also known as bokeh -- to a photo with a new feature called Portrait Lighting. \nSee also: The X factor: Apple's weird relationship with product numbers and names \nCurrently in beta, Portrait Lighting alters lighting in a photo. There are a total of five different lighting options: natural, studio, control, stage, and stage light mono (black and white). \nI've had success with the first three options, and have failed miserably at both of the studio light options. Stage Light removes the background, turning it to black, leaving the subject in the foreground with added shadows and adjusted highlights. \nApple showed off some amazing photos captured with Stage Light during the keynote, but for me, I've found most of the time the photos just look fake. For example, one photo tried to hide my ear as if it were in the background, leaving jagged lines in its place. It looked like a bad computer render of myself. Look at this photo of my dog, Emoji. He looks fancy, but also fake. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet \nAs for the three Portrait Lighting modes I've had success with, I've captured some pretty amazing photos. The above shot was taken with the iPhone 8 Plus in Portrait Mode with the Studio Light Portrait Lighting setting. \nJust a few inches below the top of the cup, you can see the spoon and piece of chocolate are slightly out of focus, while the heart decoration is sharp and well lit. Frankly, it's stunning to have captured this on a smartphone. \nOr this photo I posted on Facebook. I was waiting in line at Chipotle, lifted the phone up and asked my son to smile. I didn't spend time framing or ensuring the lighting was best for Portrait Mode as I've done with the iPhone 7 Plus. I took the picture, and it came out really well. \nAs I said in my iPhone 8 review, Apple's newest phones are the best smartphone cameras I have ever used. I used to rely on Samsung's devices to take my photos, especially when on a trip with my family; I now leave them behind. In fact, I recently spent three days in San Diego with only the iPhone 8 Plus. Those who know me can vouch for how rare something like that is. Its own biggest competitor \nRight now, Apple faces stiff competition from Samsung's smartphones . Samsung's Galaxy S8 Plus or Note 8 are both reasonable and valid to put up against Apple's iPhone 8 Plus. \nNevertheless, I think Apple's biggest competition, in particular for the bigger and more expensive iPhone 8 Plus, is the iPhone X. The iPhone X is only slightly more expensive, ships with a more robust camera setup, and is smaller in overall footprint. \nIt's hard to justify and encourage someone to wait for a device that's not even out yet. It's also a device we've only seen in very controlled environments. But it's hard not to bring it up when discussing the iPhone 8 lineup, knowing a better looking and just as capable device is on the horizon. \nSee also: iPhone X: Sorry Apple, but I just can't face using Face ID \nIn every sense, the iPhone 8 Plus is the best iPhone I have ever used. I appreciate the glass back, added wireless and fast charging, and the camera is terrific. Yet, I haven't ordered one because of the iPhone X. \nGranted, the $999 price tag of the iPhone X isn't for everyone. The iPhone 8 Plus starts at $799 for 64GB of storage, with the 256GB model currently priced at $949. If you opted to order an 8 Plus right this minute, I wouldn't blame you at all -- especially if you're updating from an iPhone prior to last year's model, or for that matter an older Android smartphone. \nFor everyone else, though, the iPhone X will be available on November 3.

CBS News coverage: Read More \nNew research by the Open Tech Institute has found over 200 violations by the NSA and the FBI since the introduction of a controversial surveillance provision designed to collect foreign intelligence. Violations include over-collecting data, violating attorney-client privilege, and conducting unlawful surveillance of Americans, who are generally protected from spying under the constitution. \nThe research is the first comprehensive, compiled list of violations of the provision, known as section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which is designed to collect data on foreign persons overseas, but also incidentally collects a large amount of data on Americans. The statute is the legal basis for the PRISM program and the tapping of global undersea fiber optic cables. \nWhile the research shows the violations are inadvertent, it reveals a pattern of systematic problems about the scale of the US government's sprawling and complex surveillance program, said the project's lead. \n\"The real threat to privacy isn't that an individual person is engaging in intentional wrongdoing, it's that lots of people are accidentally breaking the rules, or that the surveillance and data retention systems aren't built to follow the rules in the first place,\" Robyn Greene, policy counsel and government affairs lead at the Open Technology Institute, told ZDNet . \nAccording to the data, the majority of violations occurred in 2014 and 2015, with most relating to running unlawful searches of data and improperly targeting a person or account for surveillance. \nThat has impacted the privacy of \"countless\" Americans, she said. \nGreene notes that the violations are not willful. \"They are inadvertent or unintentional,\" she said. \"However, they are of the most concern because they represent systemic problems that result from the scope and complexity of the Section 702 surveillance program.\" \n\"As such, and as many of the reports acknowledge, the impact of these unintentional violations on Americans' privacy can be significant and prolonged,\" she said. \nOne of the most striking points to come out of the research, Greene noted, was how long it took for the government to report violations to the FISA Court, which authorizes and oversees the government's surveillance powers. \nOne of the most egregious cases of unlawful surveillance, she explained, was revealed in a declassified ruling by the FISA Court, which found the NSA had unlawfully spied on Americans. The government stopped a secret form of wiretapping after the NSA realized analysts had been intercepting content on its \"upstream\" internet data collection, which collects data entering and leaving the US from telecom partners like AT&T and Verizon, that merely mentioned a target of surveillance. \n\"It took over five years for the NSA to figure out that it had been searching for Americans' communications in upstream collection, which it wasn't allowed to do,\" Greene said. \nOne overseeing surveillance judge called the searches a \"very serious Fourth Amendment issue,\" and criticized the NSA for an institutional \"lack of candor\" for not disclosing the conduct sooner. \n\"Even after an Inspector General pointed out the problem, it took [the NSA] another year to notify the FISA Court, even though they're supposed to file a notice of compliance incident immediately, and then it took five more months to finally admit there was no reasonable solution, so they had to stop the collection and delete the previously collected data so that it couldn't be improperly accessed,\" Greene said. \nThe research comes shortly before the section 702 provision is set to expire. \nCongress has until the end of the year to pass a bill that puts the section 702 statute back in the law books, or the NSA risks losing those powers at the end of the annual intelligence cycle. US intelligence chiefs are pushing for a permanent reauthorization of the surveillance powers, while privacy groups are fighting for greater transparency. \nSeveral members of Congress have vowed to fight the reauthorization until they learn how many Americans are swept up in section 702 surveillance.

This breach has impacted all of them. It has impacted all of us.\" \nThe former CEO offered regulators a timeline of the events leading to the catastrophic data breach, saying that the chain started on 8 March, when US-CERT sent the company a notice of a requirement to patch an Apache Struts bug, software used in the Equifax online dispute portal. \nWhile Equifax claims that such patches are usually applied within 48 hours, in this case, \"the vulnerable version of Apache Struts within Equifax was not identified or patched in response to the internal March 9 notification to information technology personnel,\" according to Smith. \nOn 15 March, the firm's security team ran scans \"that should have identified any systems that were vulnerable to the Apache Struts issue,\" however, as noted by a number of security researchers , vulnerability scanners will only pick up this bug if they are pointed directly at a Struts URL. \nOtherwise, the vulnerability remains hidden. \n\"Equifax's efforts undertaken in March 2017 did not identify any versions of Apache Struts that were subject to this vulnerability, and the vulnerability remained in an Equifax web application much longer than it should have,\" the former CEO admitted. \"I understand that Equifax's investigation into these issues is ongoing.\" \n\"The company knows, however, that it was this unpatched vulnerability that allowed hackers to access personal identifying information,\" Smith added. \nThe first time this vulnerability was exploited occurred on May 13, but Equifax remained in the dark. It appears the threat actors behind the breach -- or, perhaps, even separate groups -- continued to root around the PII of consumers between May 13 and July 30. \nIt was not until July 29 that the Equifax security team noticed \"suspicious network traffic\" flowing in and out of the consumer disputes portal, by which time, the damage was done. \nSmith was made aware of the problem the next day after the portal was taken offline to address the bug. Equifax then reached out to cyberforensics firm Mandiant for help and notified the FBI. \nMandiant traced the issue during the following month, but finding out exactly how much PII had been compromised was difficult, according to the former chief. \n\"A substantial complication was that the information stolen from Equifax had been stored in various data tables, so tracing the records back to individual consumers, given the volume of records involved, was extremely time-consuming and difficult,\" Smith admitted. \"To facilitate the forensic effort, I approved the use by the investigative team of additional computer resources that significantly reduced the time to analyze the data.\" \nOn August 22, the Equifax board was notified, and after the public was made aware of the breach, all hell broke loose. \nMillions of customers called in, the company could not cope, and Smith admitted both call center staff and the website was not up to scratch. One major issue, for example, was the inclusion of a clause in the website which decreed those who used the service waived their rights to a class-action lawsuit. \n\"That provision -- which was never intended to apply in the first place -- was immediately removed as soon as it was discovered. (I was informed later that it had simply been inadvertently included in terms and conditions that were essentially \"cut and pasted\" from a different Equifax offering.),\" according to Smith. \n\"Accountability starts at the top and I, therefore, decided to step down as CEO and retire early to allow the company to move forward,\" Smith said. \nThe damage is already done, but Equifax has scrambled to put together what it calls a \"robust package of remedial protections\" for Americans impacted by the breach. \nWhile there is no word on damage control efforts for victims outside of the US, the company says that it will offer free credit monitoring, access to Equifax credit files, an insurance policy which will cover \"out of pocket expenses\" for those affected, and scans across the underbelly of the Internet to check for signs that Social Security numbers are being sold. \nIn addition, the credit monitoring agency will offer a tool that allows consumers to lock and unlock their credit files \"for life, and at no cost.\" \nHowever, this tool will not be available until next year and considering the firm's performance of late, we will have to see just how the tool performs -- and when it lands -- in the future. \n\"This has been a devastating experience for the men and women of Equifax. But I know that under the leadership of Paulino and Mark they will work tirelessly, as we have in the past two months, to making things right,\" Smith says. \"Giving consumers more control of their data is a start, but is not a full solution in a world where the threats are always evolving.\" \n\"I am hopeful there will be careful consideration of this changing landscape by both policymakers and the credit reporting industry,\" the former executive said.

They explain the motivation for the concept in a paper that explores lending habits and details a usability study. \nThe concept is grounded in findings that people lend their phones, despite the risk of exposing personal information. Research has also found that lending is also more common in poorer countries. \nThe prototype consists of a 3D-printed housing with a slot for the main device, and slide-in rails on the back for the two smaller devices. \nIt uses a Nexus 6P as the main phone, a Nexus 4 as the medium phone, and custom hardware for the small device. The smaller devices have NFC tags in the case that are used by the Nexus 6P's NFC chip to detect when a secondary device is attached or detached. \nThe prototype is too unwieldy to be used as a daily device, but does demonstrate how the lending mechanisms can work. \nAs shown in a video , when the medium device is slid out, it displays a menu of icons for different lending modes, including a single-app mode, guest mode, full access, and screen sharing. \nIf none of the options is pressed, the secondary device displays a list of default apps and ones that are locked. The person loaning the device can hit a padlocked app to request access, which triggers a notification on the main device for approving or denying access. \nThey've also enabled a monitoring view that provides the main device a full view of the smaller device's screen and a breakdown of app usage. \nThe researchers have entertained the idea of optional modularity, or a phone without any modules that can be enabled with modular pieces when needed, such as on a road trip with the kids. \nAnd they reckon it would be possible to create a lendable, modular smartphone about as thick as Google's Project Ara device, which was 9.7mm thick. \nTeddy Seyed, lead author of the paper, told MIT Technology Review that parents often quickly realize the feature could be useful for sharing the phone with their kids.

Lenovo's iconic laptop's 25th birthday will be marked by an event in Japan as the company rolls out a special edition of the device that spurred corporate mobility. \nThe ThinkPad -- initially an IBM creation -- has thrived as it has changed hands to Lenovo. Lenovo has already teased a future ThinkPad prototype that bends and folds like a book. This ThinkPad isn't anywhere near production, but the prototype was quite the concept laptop. \nWith Lenovo's birthday it's worth outlining a few key facts: The father of the ThinkPad is Arimasa Naitoh. Naitoh is the reason Lenovo is having the ThinkPad birthday party in Japan. There have been four generations of the ThinkPad, but models that are numerous and hard to track. Why? IBM and later Lenovo would customize models for corporate customers. IBM was spurred to chase battery powered computing after a Harvard Business Review article noted IT would change how companies compete. In 1984, IBM provided Harvard with luggable PCs weighing in at 35 pounds. The idea was to have a computer powerful enough to use VisiCalc for analysis. The Harvard business for IBM was under attack by other computer makers -- notably Apple and DEC. IBM's Yamato lab in Japan was tasked with cooking up something that could compete. IBM also needed to compete with Toshiba and Compaq, which manufactured the first two portable notebooks. Project Aloha was the original code name for what became the ThinkPad. Keyboards were always the ThinkPad's strength since they were descendents of the IBM Selectric electronic typewriter. The ThinkPad precursor was originally going to launch in 1990 for production runs, but IBM's North Carolina hub couldn't get the parts to fit together well. The ThinkPad was cramming multiple parts together in a small (at the time) shell. The pressure to launch the ThinkPad was intense. IBM was pushing to keep the Harvard Business School happy. IBM didn't put a big marketing push behind the L40 SX partly because it wasn't a design triumph as much as an engineering and manufacturing one. Another wrinkle: The L40 SX didn't have enough IBM technologies in it. The L40 SX did serve as the precursor to the ThinkPad brand. 700C was designed to be the L40 SX's replacement under Project Nectarine. The big advance for 700C was a color LCD -- even though it wasn't clear how much color would make it into the screen. In 1992, the ThinkPad brand launched. Two other critical decisions with the 700C were that the notebook would be black and include the ThinkPad's iconic TrackPoint. The ThinkPad 700C had a developer's launch in April 1992. The 700C launched at Comdex weighing in at 5.7 pounds and came with a $4,350 price tag.

smartphones and PC replacements are driving up hardware spending. 0 Video: Secure your iPhone and iPad \nThe world is spending more on tech again, thanks in part to budget-busting smartphones and PC upgrades to get ready for Windows 10. Global IT spending is projected to total $3.7 trillion in 2018 -- an increase of 4.3 percent from 2017's predicted $3.5 trillion -- according to a forecast by analyst Gartner . \nEnterprise software and IT services show strong growth, but communications services continue to account for the majority of spending, according to the projections. \nAccording to Gartner, enterprise software spending is projected to grow 8.5 percent in 2017, and will grow another 9.4 per cent in 2018 to total $387 billion. IT services spending will grow four percent in 2017 to reach $931 billion, and increase 5.3 percent in 2018 to reach $980 billion. \nFor the first time in a couple of years there will be more spending on devices: up 5.3 percent in 2017 and 5 percent in 2018. Gartner said this was due to increased average selling prices for premium phones in mature markets, and \"partially due to the introduction of the iPhone 8 and 10, along with an underlying demand for PCs from businesses replacing their machines with Windows 10 PCs is driving the growth in this segment.\" \nThe iPhone X, for example, starts at $999/\u00a3999, making it one of the most expensive mass-market smartphones available. \nGartner has identified a number of markets that it thinks will make up the most \"dynamic\" portion of the IT spending forecast in 2018. Gartner's list includes cloud features (infrastructure as a service, integrated platform as a service and communications platform as a service), workplace technologies such as workstream collaboration, workforce analytics and video message-oriented middleware, as well as security (endpoint detection and response), analytics (smart data discovery) and storage (in-memory data grids). \nJohn-David Lovelock, research vice president at Gartner, said: \"Global IT spending is showing little overall growth, as are traditional markets. These top 10 markets will be the key to remaining relevant and achieving growth in the future.\" And he warned: \"Those vendors that do not move more quickly than their clients, will be left behind.\" \nSales of iPhones and other devices are on the rise.

BROUGHT TO YOU BY How to Assess Risk to Cloud-Based Data Software-as-a-service delivers significant benefits and advantages over traditional installations, but data security cannot be overlooked. Here, we discuss high-level policy considerations such as how to classify data based on its sensitivity, assign risk levels, and set access privileges based on those tiers. 0 \nWhen classifying data for risk, you must first consider a list of threats that the data and applications may face. You then weigh those risks by their likelihood. This is not an exact science, but it can be intelligently handled by an experienced security consultant. \nTypical threats include: Loss or disclosure of small/large numbers of records of personal data of customers/employees (These may be considered as four different risks) Loss or disclosure of sensitive company intellectual property, such as business plans or program source code Loss of physical media containing unencrypted, sensitive data Spread of malware through SaaS \nThis, of course, is not an exhaustive list. Any thorough plan would include more specific considerations for your business. \nIf you weigh the threats by their likelihood and their impact, though, you can get a sense of where you should prioritize your efforts. This may be as simple as multiplying a likelihood factor, from 1 for least likely to 5 for most likely, against an impact factor, from 1 for lowest impact to 5 for greatest. \nTo determine these factors, there are many questions you should ask. This is where an expert in risk analysis can help. Among these are: How many people access the data? To what extent is the data anonymized (e.g. storing only the last 4 digits of a credit card number)? Does the data ever leave the SaaS for other domains? Is it processed on partner sites or on-premises company systems? Is the data always encrypted, at rest and in transit? \nThe real-world list is much longer. But an important question to ask right now is, how do you apply this risk assessment to the world of SaaS providers like Microsoft Office 365 and Google G Suite? \nSaaS providers are not bereft of security features, however they don't have the functionality required to mitigate your organization's risk. For that, the introduction of a third party CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) - such as PaloAlto Networks' Aperture -- is necessary. The best CASBs operate in the cloud themselves and integrate with SaaS applications at the API layer. In this scenario, the CASB has access to user information and system logs, allowing it to automate policy enforcement. \nA CASB like Aperture monitors the actual data being accessed by the user and can therefore examine it for sensitivity. Does it have the characteristics of a technical diagram? Is it software source code? Does the data in it match the patterns of social security numbers or other PII? Are emails being forwarded to an unauthorized domain? If any of these is the case, does the user have authority to access it and send it? \nOnly a security policy operating in the SaaS application itself can detect malicious events as they happen and put a stop to them. In addition to Aperture, Palo Alto Networks can help with risk assessment and security planning. \nLearn more about Palo Alto Networks \u00ae Next-Generation Security Platform for cloud at go.paloaltonetworks.com/secureclouds .

Buttons, speakers, charging ports, and even the SIM card are all located in the same exact spot. \nMost cases for the iPhone 7 Plus will work on the 8 Plus, which is good news for those who upgrade each year and don't want to wait for the iPhone X . Battery life and performance \nThe iPhone 8 Plus uses the same A11 Bionic processor as the iPhone 8, with a total of six cores. Its battery is smaller than the iPhone 7 Plus, but thanks to A11 Bionic chip, the 8 Plus is more power efficient. \nI was able to get through over 36 hours of use from a single charge. On days of traveling and heavy use, I still had enough power to get to the end of the day without needing to recharge. Double the camera Jason Cipriani/ZDNet \nThe iPhone 8 Plus has two rear-facing cameras; one telephoto, and one wide-angle. Both are 12-megapixel sensors, with the FaceTime camera on the front being 7-megapixels. \nThe new cameras feature the same ISP and sensor improvements as the iPhone 8, but where it diverges from its smaller sibling is Portrait Mode. As with the iPhone 7 line, the bigger model leverages the two rear-facing cameras to add depth to photos without the need for expensive hardware and large lenses required by dedicated cameras. \nThe iPhone 8 Plus continues to blur the lines by adding depth -- also known as bokeh -- to a photo with a new feature called Portrait Lighting. \nSee also: The X factor: Apple's weird relationship with product numbers and names \nCurrently in beta, Portrait Lighting alters lighting in a photo. There are a total of five different lighting options: natural, studio, control, stage, and stage light mono (black and white). \nI've had success with the first three options, and have failed miserably at both of the studio light options. Stage Light removes the background, turning it to black, leaving the subject in the foreground with added shadows and adjusted highlights. \nApple showed off some amazing photos captured with Stage Light during the keynote, but for me, I've found most of the time the photos just look fake. For example, one photo tried to hide my ear as if it were in the background, leaving jagged lines in its place. It looked like a bad computer render of myself. Look at this photo of my dog, Emoji. He looks fancy, but also fake. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet \nAs for the three Portrait Lighting modes I've had success with, I've captured some pretty amazing photos. The above shot was taken with the iPhone 8 Plus in Portrait Mode with the Studio Light Portrait Lighting setting. \nJust a few inches below the top of the cup, you can see the spoon and piece of chocolate are slightly out of focus, while the heart decoration is sharp and well lit. Frankly, it's stunning to have captured this on a smartphone. \nOr this photo I posted on Facebook. I was waiting in line at Chipotle, lifted the phone up and asked my son to smile. I didn't spend time framing or ensuring the lighting was best for Portrait Mode as I've done with the iPhone 7 Plus. I took the picture, and it came out really well. \nAs I said in my iPhone 8 review, Apple's newest phones are the best smartphone cameras I have ever used. I used to rely on Samsung's devices to take my photos, especially when on a trip with my family; I now leave them behind. In fact, I recently spent three days in San Diego with only the iPhone 8 Plus. Those who know me can vouch for how rare something like that is. Its own biggest competitor \nRight now, Apple faces stiff competition from Samsung's smartphones . Samsung's Galaxy S8 Plus or Note 8 are both reasonable and valid to put up against Apple's iPhone 8 Plus. \nNevertheless, I think Apple's biggest competition, in particular for the bigger and more expensive iPhone 8 Plus, is the iPhone X. The iPhone X is only slightly more expensive, ships with a more robust camera setup, and is smaller in overall footprint. \nIt's hard to justify and encourage someone to wait for a device that's not even out yet. It's also a device we've only seen in very controlled environments. But it's hard not to bring it up when discussing the iPhone 8 lineup, knowing a better looking and just as capable device is on the horizon. \nSee also: iPhone X: Sorry Apple, but I just can't face using Face ID \nIn every sense, the iPhone 8 Plus is the best iPhone I have ever used. I appreciate the glass back, added wireless and fast charging, and the camera is terrific. Yet, I haven't ordered one because of the iPhone X. \nGranted, the $999 price tag of the iPhone X isn't for everyone. The iPhone 8 Plus starts at $799 for 64GB of storage, with the 256GB model currently priced at $949. If you opted to order an 8 Plus right this minute, I wouldn't blame you at all -- especially if you're updating from an iPhone prior to last year's model, or for that matter an older Android smartphone. \nFor everyone else, though, the iPhone X will be available on November 3.

And if there are two things I never want to put together on a phone, it's bound to be glass and slippery. A glass back is bound to break when dropped, and it's expensive to replace . That said, I'm never one to use cases for more than a day or two, and I don't plan on doing so with the iPhone 8. Performance \nAs is typically the case with each new iPhone, Apple also introduced a new A-series processor. The A11 Bionic boasts six cores, four are dedicated to common tasks such as checking email and browsing the web. The remaining two cores are designed to maximize performance, in particular during graphics intensive processes such as gaming and augmented reality. \nThe four efficiency cores of the A11 Bionic provide the same computing power as Apple's A8 chip, but at one-third of the required power. \nReviewing devices and quantifying performance gains is always a delicate balance of expressing daily use and perceived speed boosts. I mentioned in my initial hands-on with the new iPhones felt faster, and that I planned on going back to the iPhone 7 Plus to verify. \nI've done just that, and the difference is even more pronounced. The iPhone 8 is much, much faster than the previous generation iPhone and it's not even close. \nAlso: Everything you need to know about charging your iPhone 8 | iPhone 8 Plus costs $295.44 to make | As expected, the iPhone 8 breaks if you drop it (but it's better than the Samsung Note 8) | iPhone 8, iPhone X vs Android flagships: Speed tests say it's not even close \nMy one gripe about overall performance is more focused on iOS 11 than it is on the iPhone 8 itself. I have experienced issues with the device soft restarting itself after interacting with notifications from the lock screen, as well as random instances of screen rotation not properly working. \nI'm currently running iOS 11.0.1 on the iPhone 8, and plan on installing the public beta of iOS 11.1 after this review is live for further testing. \nI experienced the same issues on my iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 8, so I know it's not specific to one device. Augmented Reality \nSpeaking of performance, with the release of iOS 11 Apple has added augmented reality capabilities to millions of devices around the world. The iPhone 8 lineup is the first set of Apple devices built with this feature in mind. \nI used and tested several AR apps during my time with the iPhone 8, and found it as fascinating and impressive as it is boring. \nDon't get me wrong, the ability to accurately measure a room or object using my phone's camera is something I once scoffed at being possible. But the current state of augmented apps and games in the App Store is an abundance of single-use scenarios. \nTake the IKEA app that lets you place different furniture and household items in a living space to get an idea of how it would look. It's neat, but once you have the furniture, you're not likely to go back into the app and shop for another couch. That'd be far too expensive. \nStar and planet mapping app Sky Guide is, thus far, the only app I can see myself and others coming back to time and time again. The app has always mapped out the sky above, including constellations, planets, and stars. With the release of iOS 11, however, Sky Guide now precisely overlays the exact location of each item using AR. It's fascinating and educational. \nI think my complaints about the current state of AR on iOS boils down to using a smartphone as the screen. Holding up a phone and looking at alien robots battling for supremacy on my kitchen table while walking in circles, pinching and zooming on a small screen to move objects limited and cumbersome. \nNow, if Apple were to build a pair of augmented reality glasses I could control with my voice and use gestures to manipulate objects in front of me as it overlaid objects, well, I think that would be intriguing. \nI'm not trying to take away from what Apple has done with iOS 11 and bringing augmented reality to users who would not otherwise seek it out will only help push AR apps and use cases into the mainstream. I just think there's a lot more work to be done before it goes beyond single use cases. Battery life and wireless charging \nBattery life of the iPhone 8 matches my experience with the iPhone 7 before it. With the iPhone 8, powering through an entire day of use isn't unreasonable. On days of particularly heavy use, the need to charge for a few minutes isn't unusual. \nThe real news with the iPhone 8 lineup in relation to the battery is the addition of wireless and fast charging. There are two wireless charging standards, Qi and PMA. Apple adopted the former standard for the iPhone 8 and iPhone X. Meaning, any current Qi wireless charging pad should work with the new iPhones. \nTo be clear, it's not a completely wireless solution. The pad still needs to have power running to it, so there's a cord involved. However, to charge an iPhone, you only need to place it on the charging pad and it will begin charging. \nAn iPhone 8 Plus charging in RAVPower's Fast Wireless Charging Pad. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet \nApple included Belkin's BoostUp charging pad with my review units, and I also used RAVPower's Fast Wireless Charging Pad during my time with the devices. Both pads have a status light to let you know when a phone is placed on it to indicate it's charging, and are capable of providing up to 7.5W of charging power. Currently, however, Apple has limited the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus to 5W wireless charging. \nA future software update, potentially iOS 11.1, will enable faster wireless charging of 7.5W. \nIn other words, right now both iPhones charge at the same rate as the Lightning connector and wall adapter that's included with the phones. \nWireless charging is one of these features I've always enjoyed using with Android devices for the simple fact that it's seamless. Place your phone down and it charges. You don't have to think about it. \nFor example, on my desk is a wireless charging pad. It's where I place my phone - regardless of type - when I'm working. I no longer think about where the phone goes, and a side effect of something I naturally do is that it charges any compatible phone. And now the iPhone is added to the list of devices that will stay charged. \nAlongside the new iPhones Apple announced its own charging pad. The AirPower Mat won't begin shipping until early 2018, but it adds support for charging three devices at once - something current Qi pads lack. Apple will begin selling a new wireless charging compatible case for AirPods, and the Apple Watch Series 3 is compatible with Qi charging to use with the AirPower Mat.

Must read : iOS 11 battery life is terrible \nAccording to Geekbench benchmarks, the A11 Bionic processor that powers the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and the eagerly awaited iPhone X, is so fast it crushes the Snapdragon chip found in the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. \n\u201cAt this point, you\u2019ve got desktop-class performance in a handset. There\u2019s no way of looking at it any other way,\u201d John Poole, founder of Primate Labs, told Tom\u2019s Guide . \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought to use my first-generation iPhone to edit video. I would\u2019ve thought you were crazy.\u201d \nNow I\u2019ve read a lot of stuff drawing parallels between Apple\u2019s A11 chip and Intel\u2019s 7th-generation Core i5 processor, and while you can make some comparisons, there are differences. One difference between the two is that the A11 can only sustain that high workloads for short periods before heat becomes and issue, while an i5 chip can keep on going thanks to active cooling. \nBut there\u2019s no doubt that the iPhone 8 is fast and very responsive, and it\u2019s quite a noticeable improvement even compared to the iPhone 7, especially when it comes to tasks such as unlocking and running some apps. \nBut the performance is horribly inconsistent, and that unpredictability makes it annoying and frustrating. Some apps run super-fast, others (and this list varies from built-in apps such as Music to third-party apps such as Facebook) can feel terribly kludgy at times. \nOn top of that, the huge amount of lag and frame drops in the user interface (yes, even on a brand new, out of the box device) really lets the experience down. The silicone might be fast, but it\u2019s clear that iOS is throwing a huge number of speed bumps in front of the A11. \nI feel like Apple fitted my sports car with square wheels. \nWi-Fi and Bluetooth bugginess also takes away from the feeling of owning the world\u2019s fastest smartphone. \nI think that the disappointing thing about the iPhone 8 is that without the benchmarks to tell me that it\u2019s the world\u2019s fastest smartphone, I honestly wouldn\u2019t have guessed it was. Yes, it\u2019s snappy, but there are times when it isn\u2019t, and to find out that it\u2019s not a silicone roadblock means that Apple didn\u2019t put as much effort into streamlining iOS as it could have done. \nAs for the claim that this massive bump in performance will \u201cfuture proof\u201d the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, I\u2019m not convinced. When the iPhone 7 landed a little over a year ago, its CPU was 120 times faster than the original iPhone , with the GPU being a whopping 240 times faster , and yet now, one generation on in both hardware and iOS releases, I\u2019m hearing from people who feel that their device is feeling its age. That\u2019s the nature of hardware improvements. The next generation of software use (and abuse) the power at its disposal. \nThis also accounts for why your iPhone or iPad (or any other device for that matter) feels slower after updating. It\u2019s not a conspiracy to get you to by a new device; it\u2019s just the wheels of progress. \nSo, what\u2019s it like to own the world\u2019s fastest smartphone? Meh. It feels like Apple took powerful silicone and wasted its potential by loading what feels like poorly optimized code over the top of it. \nSee also:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

A month after that announcement, AltspaceVR announced it would live on , but it didn't share how it had come up with the lacking funds. (My guess is Microsoft swooped in.) \nMicrosoft officials highlighted some of the potential scenarios where its officials think AltspaceVR could add value in its blog post about today's event: \"AltspaceVR is one of the pioneers in immersive communications bringing people together in virtual reality from over 160 countries to attend meetups, comedy shows, yoga classes, dance parties, and large-scale events hosted by NBC, Reggie Watts, Justin Roiland, Drew Carey and more.\" \nDuring today's Mixed Reality event, Microsoft also officially announced that Samsung also would be selling a mixed reality headset as of this holiday. The Samsung HMD Odyssey ( information about which leaked recently , thanks to \"The Walking Cat\" on Twitter) will be available for $499. \nAs of today, Oct. 3, mixed reality headsets from Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung are all available for customers to pre-order. Support for these mixed-reality headsets will be baked into the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, which will begin rolling out to mainstream users on Oct. 17. Some Microsoft officials have started referring to Windows 10 Fall Creators Update as \"the first spatial operating system\" because of the Mixed Reality platform that's built in. \nMicrosoft also reminded users that the SteamVR catalog will be available to those using Windows Mixed Reality as of this holiday. Developers can get access to the preview of SteamVR games running on Windows Mixed Reality as of today; consumers will get access to the preview this holiday season. \nMicrosoft management is bullish about full immersive mixed-reality and augmented-reality experiences like what's offered by the HoloLens. CEO Satya Nadella called out mixed reality as one of Microsoft's three big bets (the other two being artificial intelligence and quantum computing) for the future in his book Hit Refresh . \nWindows Mixed Reality, formerly known as Windows Holographic , is Microsoft's platform supporting the virtual reality-like Mixed Reality headsets that will be tethered to Windows 10 PCs, as well as the standalone Windows 10-based HoloLens. Microsoft is pitching Windows Mixed Reality as having appeal to gamers, consumers, and businesses for certain scenarios.

The ball also had the advantage of eliminating jams, where more than one key was struck at once and the typebars became entangled. \nThe type ball worked by revolving and tilting \u2014 according to the direction of a sophisticated mechanism \u2014 as it moved across the page. Each character had a binary code, one for tilt and one for rotate. \nThomas Watson Jr, the then president of IBM, called the \"golf ball\" the \"most totally distinctive invention we've ever made as a company\". \nThe \"golf ball\" printer technology was used in many other IBM machines, including computer operator consoles and terminals.

Published: October 3, 2017 -- 14:00 GMT (15:00 BST) \nCaption by: Nick Heath \nThis IBM 1052 was a console output printer for System/360 machines in the 1960s. \nIt was a cut-down Selectric I/O printer with no backspace and no tab. Keyboard input was provided by a separate keyboard. Published: October 3, 2017 -- 14:00 GMT (15:00 BST) \nCaption by: Nick Heath \nThe IBM Electronic Composer, announced in 1975, had the ability to store about 5,000 characters in its memory. \nUsers were able to work on two different documents, thanks to the machine having a main and alternate storage area. \nThe machine had two power switches, one for the typewriter portion and the second for the memory \u2014 which, if powered down, would result in the documents being lost. \nThe machine was an improvement over IBM's earlier Selectric Composer as the user could have the machine retype stored documents differently justified, rather than having to manually retype them. Published: October 3, 2017 -- 14:00 GMT (15:00 BST) \nCaption by: Nick Heath \nOne of IBM's early experiments with releasing smaller computer systems was the IBM 5110 Computing System from 1978. \nThe 5110 was designed to be used for automating common business tasks, such as general ledger and accounts payable. It could also be reprogrammed to provide reports to help management analyse sales, schedule resources, reduce inventory cost and plan future growth. \nThe 5110 featured a desktop unit that housed a CPU, a keyboard and a 1,024-character display screen. The desktop system unit alone weighed 50 pounds. \nIt was available with between 16KB and 64KB of memory, and could store as much as 204,000 bytes of information per tape cartridge or 1.2 million bytes on a single diskette. Published: October 3, 2017 -- 14:00 GMT (15:00 BST) \nCaption by: Nick Heath \nThe Displaywriter System, announced in June 1980, introduced some of the convenience of PC word processing software at a time when documents were generally created on typewriters. \nThe machine could store and recall documents so they could be revised and could check the spelling of 50,000 commonly-used words. \nThe system was designed to allow users to produce high quality documents at \"rough draft speed\". \nDisplaywriter featured an Intel 8086 processor with 160KB, 192KB or 224KB of RAM and was available with a single or double diskette unit. \nA basic system included a display with a typewriter-like keyboard, a printer and a device to read and write to diskettes, which was capable of storing more than 100 pages of text. \nTwo printers were available with the machine, initially the 5215, a Selectric-based printer similar to the magnetic card Selectric typewriters and later an IBM 'Daisywheel' printer. Published: October 3, 2017 -- 14:00 GMT (15:00 BST) \nCaption by: Nick Heath \nThe System/23 Datamaster was announced by IBM's General Systems Division in July 1981, only one month before the IBM PC. \nThe Datamaster is an all-in-one computer with a built-in text mode CRT display, keyboard and two 8-inch floppy disk drives. \nThe machine was powered by an 8-bit 8085 and had 256KB of memory. A BASIC interpreter was also built into the computer. \nThe intention of Datamaster was to provide a computer that could be operated without specialists and the machine was designed to be operated by novice users. \nThe machine came with a choice of two printers and accounting and word processing software. A full function data processing installation, with a single computer and an 80 character-per-second printer cost $9,830, which according to IBM was its \"cheapest solution at that time\". Published: October 3, 2017 -- 14:00 GMT (15:00 BST) \nCaption by: Nick Heath \nIn 1981 IBM decided to move beyond the mainframes it had been building for decades and launch its first mass market personal computer, the IBM 5150. \nThe PC was a success for IBM \u2014 particularly in the office market \u2014 shipping more than 800,000 units in the two years after it went on sale. What helped drive the machine\u2019s popularity was both the familiarity of the IBM name and the broad range of peripherals and software available for the computer. \nThe machine spawned a market in IBM-PC clones, known as IBM PC compatibles, made possible by the fact that the machines were built using off the shelf non-IBM hardware and that Microsoft was free to licence DOS for use on third-party machines. The spread of IBM PC compatible machines created a common standard for PCs, simplifying the process of buying a PC by ensuring that any IBM compatible PC would run the same software, no matter which company made it. \nThe machine's starting price was $1,565, it ran on a 4.77Mhz Intel 8088 microprocessor, came with a keyboard, ran Microsoft DOS, supported up to 256KB of RAM and a colour display, came with an optional 160K floppy disc drive and an optional colour monitor. \nThis machine is attached to an IBM PC monochrome display and an IBM dot-matrix printer. Published: October 3, 2017 -- 14:00 GMT (15:00 BST) \nCaption by: Nick Heath \nThe IBM PC monitor, announced in 1981, could output both text and graphics. \nIt could manage two graphics modes, a resolution of 320 x 200 pixels with up to four colours or 640 x 200 pixels with a monochrome display. \nThe monitor had four text modes, based on either 40 columns by 25 lines or 80 columns by 25 lines, with up to 16 colours. \nIt was usually driven by an IBM PC Color/Graphics Adapter (CGA), which included a Motorola MC6845 display controller and 16KB of video memory. It had a 4-bit RGB1 interface. Published: October 3, 2017 -- 14:00 GMT (15:00 BST) \nCaption by: Nick Heath \nThe IBM 5155 Portable PC might weigh as much as a small suitcase but it was portable, something that couldn't be said of most computers when it was released in 1984. \nThe machine was deemed \"luggable\", a reference to its heft and the fact it weighed a not inconsiderable 30 pounds \u2014 roughly 30 times more than an iPad Air. \nInside the computer was an IBM PC XT motherboard with an Intel 8088 processor running at 4.77MHz (the same as the original IBM PC). \nIt came with 256KB of RAM, expandable to 640KB. It had one or two 360KB half-height 5.25-inch diskette (floppy disk) drives and an IBM PC colour graphics adapter driving a built-in nine-inch orange monochrome CRT display. \nThe Portable PC's operating system was IBM PC Dos 2.1 or later.

The machine's print mechanism is a simplified version of that of the IBM 5218 Displaywriter printer. Published: October 3, 2017 -- 14:00 GMT (15:00 BST) \nCaption by: Nick Heath \nThe IBM Proprinter II was one of IBM's second generation printers for personal computers. \nThe machine is a 9-wire dot-matrix printer that can produce 40 characters per second at high quality settings and 200 characters per second at lower quality. \nIt connects to a PC via Centronics parallel interface. Published: October 3, 2017 -- 14:00 GMT (15:00 BST) \nCaption by: Nick Heath \nThe IBM PC AT was the company's second-generation personal computer and was announced in 1984. \nThe machine was initially powered by an Intel 286 processor running at 6MHz, while later models ran at 8MHz. \nThe PC AT could support up to 16MB of RAM and initially had one 20MB hard drive. Expansion was via six 16-bit expansion slots and two 8-bit slots. \nThe display was usually driven by an IBM monochrome Display/Printer adapter or an IBM Colour/Graphics Adapter. Machines released later used the IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter and, sometimes, Professional Graphics Adapters.

In spite of being a PS/2 (which were mostly micro channel architecture) it had a PC AT bus. \nIt could support between 2MB and 18MB of RAM, had one 3.5-inch floppy drive and a 60MB hard disk. An illuminated VGA monochrome LCD screen served as its display. \nThe PS/2 LX 40 SX was later superseded by the successful IBM ThinkPad range of machines. Published: October 3, 2017 -- 14:00 GMT (15:00 BST) \nCaption by: Nick Heath \nIn 1992, IBM announced a new series of notebook computers \u2014 the ThinkPad. \nFeaturing a distinctive black case and a TrackPoint pointing device in the middle of the keyboard, the ThinkPad won more than 300 awards for design and quality. \nThe name comes from the small flip open notebook carried by IBM customer engineers to jot down reminders. The pads had \"IBM\" embossed in gold letters on one side and \"THINK\" on the other, and were known as \"Think Pads\" by the engineers. \nThis is an early example of a ThinkPad, a model 720. The machine is powered by a 50MHz 486 SLC CPU, can support up to 16MB RAM and a 120MB hard disk. \nThe display is a 9.54-inch LCD screen with a 640x480 resolution.

We are trusted by more than 39,500 customers to protect their organizations, prevent cyberattacks, and help maintain trust in the digital age. Our decade-long journey was founded on two words: innovation and disruption. The time has come to once again help change the future of the security industry, but this time we aren't forging the way by ourselves - we are building on everything we have done and dramatically changing the consumption model for the most comprehensive security achievable. It is time to unleash security innovation, entrepreneurship and better protection for our customers. \nThe Palo Alto Networks Application Framework , announced today at our Ignite 2017 conference in Vancouver, reinvents how our customers rapidly adopt the most innovative new security technologies, consumed via cloud-based apps developed by any provider, large or small. \nThe framework is built on top of the Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Security Platform, allowing our customers to access, evaluate and adopt emerging new security technologies, as an extension of the infrastructure they already own and operate. These apps can be built by us, by third-party partners, by MSSPs and by customers directly to solve any use case imaginable. Provided by Palo Alto Networks \nIt's time to elevate this discussion beyond the level of individual products and vendors. Now, customers can embrace the technology they need to keep up with the ever-changing threat landscape, not make security decisions based on the typically large upfront ROI risk and cost of deploying and managing new hardware. It is not reasonable to ask security teams to differentiate workflows and derive actionable next steps from a mountain of threat intelligence, throwing manpower and new products at the challenges, only to find the next day that the threats and specific resource needs have once again shifted. \nThe answer is to drive a level of innovation that is at least as speedy, flexible and adaptive as attackers themselves. Our journey here is beginning, but we can't do this alone. Delivering on this promise takes an entire community of developers and entrepreneurs to solve the most challenging security use cases facing our customers today. Provided by Palo Alto Networks \nThe Application Framework will feature apps developed by security providers of all sizes, including expected collaboration from over 30 leading vendors. \nBecome an Application Developer for Palo Alto Networks Application Framework \nToday we also announced the formation of a $20 million security venture fund. The fund will provide early stage capital investments to fuel development of innovative security applications. The fund expects to collaborate with Greylock Partners and Sequoia Capital to identify and evaluate innovative security applications for potential co-investment. Prospective developers can sign up for review by our Corporate Development team and VC partners here . \nLearn More \nYou'll be hearing a lot from us in the coming weeks and months about the Palo Alto Networks Application Framework and everything our community is doing to support it. Regularly here on the blog, we'll be profiling the industry vendors who have signed on to be part of our vision - and how they plan to support it. Plus, there will be plenty of opportunities to engage with us as we anticipate full availability of the framework in early 2018. \nFor more: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "palo alto networks application framework", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "palo alto networks next-generation security platform", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sequoia capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corporate development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greylock partners", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "palo alto networks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:47:14.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d88c40cc07b56619d8fc93bdf9f60f124a7fc0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmNJj7p0ZI8H0nOWHz9T6Y4ShZwVHy_2qrlTcdPWbSf5PIeLO_hewcUXYRgR3UFa2i77Rc0zzZyJQ", "site_full": "www.zdnet.com", "site": "zdnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.zdnet.com/blog/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Latest blogs for ZDNet", "title": "Restricting SaaS to Authorized Users", "title_full": "Restricting SaaS to Authorized Users", "published": "2017-10-04T00:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/09/11/90bba9e0-2e3e-47ef-9573-78a60e29c9e4/thumbnail/770x578/288c1285fb1c253d5688b81e3a824f8e/blog-13restricting-saas-to-authorized-users-658008000.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1869, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d88c40cc07b56619d8fc93bdf9f60f124a7fc0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmNJj7p0ZI8H0nOWHz9T6Y4ShZwVHy_2qrlTcdPWbSf5PIeLO_hewcUXYRgR3UFa2i77Rc0zzZyJQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T00:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Restricting SaaS to Authorized Users", "text": "\u00d7 ZDNet Multiplexer \nmul-ti-plexer-er. noun.

BROUGHT TO YOU BY Restricting SaaS to Authorized Users Once your company has decided to embrace SaaS, it's critical to lock down credentials and keep malicious actors from gaining access. We'll talk about monitoring user activity for insider threats, multifactor authentication, behavior analysis to catch anomalous activity, and other important considerations for safe SaaS deployments. 0 \nSo you've decided to use a cloud-based SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) provider such as Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365 or Box. How do you make sure that only authorized users can access your organization's data in the cloud? How do you make sure that malicious software doesn't hijack a connection to your cloud environment? \nThere are many security solutions that integrate with popular SaaS providers, making it as easy as possible for your organization to implement secure access. Ideally, each SaaS application integrates with your existing user database, the most widely used being Microsoft Active Directory, to allow for what is called single sign-on (SSO). With SSO, users can have one set of login credentials that can be used for both the company network and external networks, including SaaS applications. \nThe simplest and most popular approach to SSO is to use an identity management provider, such as Okta . These tools ensure strong authentication by requiring multiple identification factors, such as a password and a code sent to the user's mobile phone. When a user logs into an identity management app, they get a console that lists their applications, including cloud services like Google Apps and Workday as well as on-premises applications. They establish a session with the provider and then can connect to the applications without further authentication, as long as their session with the identity management provider is open. These providers also have mobile clients that can connect the user directly to the native app on their mobile devices. The applications connected to the service are said to be \"federated\" with the service, and so the service can authenticate the user to them. \nOnce you have such a unified management system for identity, you can begin to secure data and applications in a logical and systematic way based on your users and their roles in your organization. Identity management providers offer IT administrators consoles through which to perform management tasks. Users get self-service capabilities for tasks such as password resets. \nCentralized identity management also makes it easier to integrate multi-factor authentication with all of the federated apps, and even to require additional identification when a user attempts to connect from an unknown IP address, for example. \nStrong identity management also gives you a basis for defining and applying policy with tools that can perform data inspections. The most prominent example is that of DLP (Data Loss Prevention), which is the protection of particular varieties of sensitive data against misuse or theft. \nThis is where a CASB, like Palo Alto Networks' Aperture, would come into play. Aperture has access to user identity, can examine the actual data within the SaaS application (looking for specific patterns like credit card numbers, internal project code names or bank account numbers, for example), then check policy to see whether that user has permission to do what they are doing with the data. Aperture can log that event and even look at previous logs and existing data for usage patterns. \nPalo Alto Networks' next-generation firewalls integrate tightly with Okta, allowing for multi-factor authentication in cases where an access attempt violates a firewall policy. Using an integrated solution helps reduce management overhead and enables administrators to consolidate user, application, and data management in a centralized console. \nBecause the management is centralized, so is the logging, which is an important security feature. Log management and analysis are essential in detecting attacks, and yet administrators can be overwhelmed with the sheer variety of logs from enterprise applications. In a world of cloud applications, there is no way to manage users and secure access to data unless you have a central facility for doing so. A security solution that consolidates identity and access management functions not only makes it possible to bring cloud providers into your own management scheme, it also opens up secure access to new capabilities. \nTo learn more about SaaS security, please visit http://www.zdnet.com/topic/protecting-your-clouds .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "okta", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "zdnet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palo alto networks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zdnet multiplexer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google apps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salesforce", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:50:24.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "41df89c3113c3bbb42d9325f6a3d5e4ed1174245", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmNJj7p0ZI8H0g2q12VnJ4y0iA0l8dN4sOw1DQPd1l6SWTg0mLUhn4CXIizYMneyMviQ5V2fdw8zXdRUXlcu0C2rzh6a8lCf_CcF3q58dX8zvEU44Y6QhtBc-", "site_full": "www.zdnet.com", "site": "zdnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.zdnet.com/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Technology News, Analysis, Comments and Product Reviews for IT Professionals | ZDNet", "title": "Oracle's Larry Ellison: The way to prevent data theft is more automation", "title_full": "Oracle's Larry Ellison: The way to prevent data theft is more automation | ZDNet", "published": "2017-10-04T06:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/03/f1a260b6-6710-4558-ad41-f7023e7134f8/thumbnail/770x578/e09caa9b4164d08d7eb47eb17aa86c31/ellisonopenworld3.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1869, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 11, "comments": 0, "shares": 11}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 28}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "41df89c3113c3bbb42d9325f6a3d5e4ed1174245", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmNJj7p0ZI8H0g2q12VnJ4y0iA0l8dN4sOw1DQPd1l6SWTg0mLUhn4CXIizYMneyMviQ5V2fdw8zXdRUXlcu0C2rzh6a8lCf_CcF3q58dX8zvEU44Y6QhtBc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Stephanie Condon", "published": "2017-10-04T06:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Oracle's Larry Ellison: The way to prevent data theft is more automation", "text": "Larry Ellison speaks at the OpenWorld conference in San Francisco on October 3, 2017.\nOracle on Tuesday announced the availability of its cloud-native, highly-automated security and management suite.\nThe new set of integrated suites - the Oracle Identity Security Operations Center (SOC) portfolio of services and Oracle Management Cloud - will help enterprises forecast, reduce, detect and remediate cybersecurity threats.\n\"The way to prevent data theft is more automation,\" Oracle co-founder and CTO Larry Ellison said at the OpenWorld conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. \"We need a cyber defense system that automatically detects vulnerabilities, fixes vulnerabilities before an attack, and if there is an attack, detect it and shut it down.\"\nEllison unveiled the highly-automated cybersecurity system two days after he rolled out Oracle's autonomous database, called 18c .

CEO Jim Hackett, on the job at Ford for 100 days, is betting on a strategy where it can use efficiency and cost savings to fund the future. \nAs noted previously, there will be more trade-offs for multiple companies as future bets compete with delivering returns today . Nike , Taser , Campbells Soup , QVC and others are also making pivots to be more digital. \nHackett said Ford will embrace multiple technologies and focus on \"integrating hardware and software in complex devices.\" Ford's pitch almost sounded a bit Apple-ish. \nThe catch is that Ford must stick to a long-term goal of 8 percent operating margins on its vehicles. That margin is very un-Apple-like. \nHackett on a conference call outlined Ford's vision: Ford will prepare for disruption by becoming fit. There's no doubt that we've entered this period of disruption, you all know that. But we have to design the business to be more fit because it's going to give us time, resources and flexibility to evolve to where we know we have to be. We're going to be the vehicle business moving both people and goods. Some myth about not being in the car business is gone. In the future, people around the globe will still want and need our cars, trucks and SUVs and commercial vehicles. And I'm answering that question of whether Mobility would chip away at that cookie in any kind of way that would make us retreat. Not at all. Those vehicles though will be smart and connected. The reason, there's a wider berth now between dumb and smart products as we learn about robotics and their role in our vehicles. This will influence customer expectations of what they want in their vehicles in the future. Smart vehicles will be a given at Ford Motor Company. These smart vehicles will pair or thrive with a new transportation operating system. The history of transportation systems requires that pairing between whatever asset it was that moved people or goods in the environment that it was in, that could have been trails for horses, roads and stoplights for the cars as we knew them growing up, or GPS for satellites. Consequently, we see a dawning of a new transportation operating system for cities that's dealing with the fact that they're becoming more congested as more people move to cities and yet, they need more capacity. \nIn broad strokes, Ford said it is targeting the following: \nAll new vehicles in the U.S. will have built in connectivity by 2019. Ninety percent of Ford's new global vehicles will have connectivity by 2020. \nCut automotive cost growth by 50 percent through 2022 with common parts, fewer prototypes and cuts in order complexity. Ford expects $4 billion saved in incremental efficiencies over 5 years and $10 billion in materials. \nPare down customization. The current model of the Focus has 360 orderable combinations and Ford wants to get the to 26. The Escape has 2,302 combinations and Ford plans on 228. \nFocus on electrification beyond the $4.5 billion investment already planned. Ford will also move manufacturing of its next-gen Focus to China . \"Why didn't we move more quickly in the battery electric vehicles?

We are determined to keep Australians safe. And we must use every technology we can to do that.\n\"The alternative is to not use data at all.\"\nThe prime minister said the focus is to constantly improve the government's cybersecurity capabilities.\nAlso speaking with the ABC , Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Counter Terrorism Michael Keenan said it is about giving police technology that they need to do their job properly.\n\"Now currently, when they have to identify people through their face ... it can take over a week to get the information they need. We're doing it in a 1950s way, essentially, when we should be doing it in a 21st century way,\" Keenan said.\n\"So what we have developed is a new system that will allow that to happen instantly.\"\nLast month, Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told a high-powered panel at the United Nations that Australia is keen to work with communications companies to crack encrypted messages used by terrorists.\nWhile Australia supports an open, free, and secure internet, Bishop said encrypted messaging apps used by extremist groups are in the Australian government's sights.\n\"Australia is very keen to work constructively with communications service providers to prevent terrorists from using encryption to hide online,\" Bishop said.\n\"This is a significant challenge as encryption is vital for the protection of many legitimate activities including national security ecommerce and personal privacy.\n\"However, governments and the private sector have a shared interest and collective responsibility to combat the scourge of terrorism.\"\nAustralia has been pushing the encryption issue in recent months.\nIn June, Australian Attorney-General George Brandis said the issue is a priority for the government.\nThe push to deny encryption to a set of users on the internet is a bipartisan one in Australia, with the opposition Labor party signalling it will back any legislation .\n\"With terrorism a 21st century conflict, we need 21st century weapons to deal with it,\" Labor leader Bill Shorten said in July.\n\"A backdoor is typically a flaw in a software program that perhaps the -- you know, the developer of the software program is not aware of and that somebody who knows about it can exploit,\" Turnbull said in July. \"And, you know, if there are flaws in software programs, obviously, that's why you get updates on your phone and your computer all the time.\"\nAt the same press conference, Turnbull told ZDNet that the laws of Australia would trump the laws of mathematics .\n\"The laws of Australia prevail in Australia, I can assure you of that,\" he said. \"The laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia.\"\nWith AAP\nLatest Australian news Australia goes hawk with new diplomatic cyber strategy NBN launches new Sky Muster plans with more data

plans with more data techguy 23 hours ago Networking Leave a comment 10 Views (Image: NBN) \nAustralia\u2019s National Broadband Network (NBN) company has launched its new satellite packages, offering an increase in data allowances following criticisms of the service. \nConsumers living within the satellite footprint covering regional and rural areas are now able to order peak and off-peak packages from their retail service providers (RSPs) with up to 300GB of data per month at speeds of 12/1Mbps or 25/5Mbps. \n\u201cFollowing the announcement of our new wholesale Sky Muster satellite service plans earlier in the year, we received overwhelmingly positive feedback from our retail customers, regional Australians, and industry stakeholders,\u201d NBN chief customer officer Brad Whitcomb said on Wednesday. \n\u201cNBN has one of the world\u2019s leading satellite services, and we will continually look at ways we can optimise our wholesale pricing model and data plans.\u201d \nWhitcomb added that NBN is currently investigating additional education and business enhancements for its satellite service, including an \u201ceducation multicast product\u201d and an enterprise-standard wholesale product. \nNBN had announced in June that it would be doubling the monthly wholesale data limit available to its satellite RSPs \u2014 which include iiNet, Activ8me, BorderNet, Clear Networks, Harbour ISP, SkyMesh, Ant Communications, IPSTAR, ReachNet, Southern Phone, and Westnet \u2014 as well as increasing \u201caverage peak download\u201d limits on satellite plans by up to 50 percent, from 30GB to 45GB month. \nPlans are separated into a peak period between 7am and 1am, and an off-peak period, with NBN also enforcing a Fair Use Policy that caps customers on their data usage. It said it was able to boost its download limits through efficiencies allowing the service to cope with more capacity. \n\u201cLate last year, we made the decision to repurpose our second satellite, previously slated as a dormant backup service, to actively share the load in delivering more data to customers on the Sky Muster service,\u201d NBN CEO Bill Morrow said in June. \n\u201cAfter spending the last year reviewing and testing the capabilities of the service, we are now comfortable that we have the capacity to offer increased data packages to retailers.\u201d \nNBN had listened to feedback received by users and the industry, Morrow said, with the new plans a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d. \n\u201cWe will continue to optimise the pricing model and data plans of the Sky Muster service with further offerings on business and education services expected to be available in the next 12 to 18 months,\u201d Morrow said. \nUnder NBN\u2019s Corporate Plan 2018-21 , around 240,000 premises are able to order a satellite service although 400,000 will be eligible, with customers previously capped from using more than 150GB per month \u2014 75GB off peak and 75GB on peak, with 50GB extra for distance education students. \nIn August, Morrow told ZDNet that NBN is also looking into deploying a third satellite , piggybacking off existing satellites, and building out additional fixed-wireless towers in order to relieve congestion. \n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at anything and everything that might be an option to expand the capacity and the speeds for the people served by the satellite technology,\u201d Morrow told ZDNet. \n\u201cWe are looking at new satellites to go up, we are looking at the use of third-party satellites, we are looking at some micro-deployments of fixed-wireless towers that might be able to offer some relief, we\u2019re looking at layer three-type services that help use of that spectrum more efficiently for video applications as an example, so everything is on the table for consideration.\u201d \nA decision on this is a year away, Morrow told ZDNet, with NBN also looking into improving the tech on its existing two satellites . \n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that is sacred here. We are looking at anything and everything that might be feasible to offer more capacity,\u201d Morrow told Senate Estimates in June. \nSky Muster has been subject to widespread criticism, with the federal opposition party calling for an independent expert review of the satellite service it commissioned itself , saying the installation issues, data caps, outages, and lack of transparency between NBN and its RSPs need to be examined. \nAustralia\u2019s states and territories have similarly criticised the satellite service, with the South Australian government saying Sky Muster is a form of geographical-based discrimination ; the Queensland government arguing that \u201clower-grade\u201d NBN services for those in regional areas is unacceptable and inequitable; and the Northern Territory government slamming the \u201ctechnically inferior\u201d satellite service . \nIn January, NBN revealed that there had been 31,007 reschedules of Sky Muster service installations between April 2016 until October, caused mainly by technician issues, customer issues, weather, network issues, and non-standard installations, with Activ8me calling the installation process an \u201c absolute bugbear \u201c. \nThe average closure time for complaints was 21.4 days during October last year, with 520 complaints between April and October. \nAccording to Clear Networks, these complaints are exacerbated by the lack of information on connectivity issues given by NBN to RSPs, which leaves customers at the mercy of NBN\u2019s 10-day turnaround .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "whitcomb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill morrow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morrow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sky muster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad whitcomb", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sky muster", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "zdnet japan nbn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nbn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national broadband network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern phone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ant communications", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zdnet", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ipstar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queensland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T04:01:06.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c852c0b59beceff60959d3424212c46f0f8781b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmNJj7p0ZI8H0VP6oHI3g.bsRTGQOZGtbAA27m0jFiXHOhSQddi6H.5EKWeeQuZ7Ux_334VKxUQ93K7mo3BNnXi4-", "site_full": "www.zdnet.com", "site": "zdnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.zdnet.com/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Technology News, Analysis, Comments and Product Reviews for IT Professionals | ZDNet", "title": "Singapore government mulls laws on e-payment fees", "title_full": "Singapore government mulls laws on e-payment fees | ZDNet", "published": "2017-10-04T08:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.024, "main_image": "http://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/09/25/1655ed1c-1d16-11e4-8c7f-00505685119a/thumbnail/770x578/0c5d2f1fb39badb6c099dcc04b643b7d/singapore-dollar620x465.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1869, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c852c0b59beceff60959d3424212c46f0f8781b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmNJj7p0ZI8H0VP6oHI3g.bsRTGQOZGtbAA27m0jFiXHOhSQddi6H.5EKWeeQuZ7Ux_334VKxUQ93K7mo3BNnXi4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Eileen Yu", "published": "2017-10-04T08:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Singapore government mulls laws on e-payment fees", "text": "ZDNet Japan Singapore government mulls laws on e-payment fees Country is assessing other jurisdictions to decide whether to regulate e-payment surcharges to encourage cashless adoption, but says it currently wants to focus on pushing low-cost options to spur market competition. 0 \nThe Singapore government may be eager to drive e-payment adoption in the country, but it appears to want to do so through encouraging market competition, instead of introducing legislation to bring down surcharges for e-payments. \nDeputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who also was Minister-in-Charge of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), said the government was assessing the impact of laws regulating e-payment fees in other countries. Read More \nHis comments were part of a written response to a question posed in parliament this week, on whether there were plans to mandate a cap on transaction fees and platform rental charges imposed by e-payment platform providers to drive the adoption of cashless payments amongst consumers and, in particular, small and midsize businesses. \nTharman said: \"As of now, our focus is to ensure low-cost options are available and spur competition to keep cost affordable [for] small businesses. It will minimally be cheaper than having to handle cash. \n\"As to whether we should regulate the fees for e-payment, we are studying the experience of other jurisdictions and will study them carefully.\" \nHe noted that the government was looking at various components to drive e-payment adoption, including ensuring user interface was convenient and easy to use, establishing necessary standards such as a common QR code to facilitate all types of e-payment, and keeping cost of e-payment as low as possible. \n\"To keep fees at a reasonable level, it is important to ensure there is enough competition. Hence, we have always insisted on an open architecture system so that e-payment will not be monopolised over time by one dominant player,\" the minister said. \nMAS, for instance, collaborated with the banking community to introduce a peer-to-peer funds transfer service, called PayNow . This would be further expanded to include businesses to provide a cheaper way to make e-payments, Tharman said, adding that PayNow would support the common QR code once the specifications were established later this year. \nHe noted that services such as PayNow eliminated the need for point-of-sale (POS) terminals or rental fees associated with such equipment. \n\"The government has also been engaging various stakeholders to raise awareness of the available e-payment solutions and, hence, help drive further adoption,\" he added. \"Businesses need to be aware of the advantages of various e-payment solutions and identify a solution that would best suit their needs.\" \nSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had been a huge advocate of a cashless society, stressing the need for the country to \"catch up\" to others such as China, especially as it strived to become a smart nation . \nMarket observers, though, pointed to prohibitively high transaction fees--typically a 3 percent surcharge--imposed by credit card companies. Consumers also were made to pay additional fees for online purchases, for example, an addition $1.50 \"convenience fee\" when they purchased movie tickets online or via mobile. \nGovernments in other countries already had implemented or were implementing laws to regulate payment fees. A new ruling last month came into effect in Australia, banning all local businesses from making consumers pay excessive surcharges for using EFTPOS--the equivalent of NETS in Singapore--and credit cards. The mandate also required businesses looking to set a flat surcharge across all payment methods to do so at the level of the lowest cost, rather than the average of the different surcharges. \nLaws in the EU also prohibited banks and card companies from charging retailers more than a 0.3 percent surcharge for processing credit card payments. And from January next year, all surcharges for purchases made by cards would be banned across the region.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://abs.org.sg/consumer-banking/pay-now", "http://www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Parliamentary-Replies/2017/Regulating-transaction-and-platform-rental-fees-charged-by-epayment-platform-providers.aspx#.WdJw4BDjtVM.facebook", "http://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/3028aab8-1d15-11e4-8c7f-00505685119a/resize/220x165/1cb87c10f04c00c905e68c4099fdd448/singapore-merlion-thumb620x465.jpg", "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jul/19/charges-paying-card-banned-flights-tax-bills", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-31/eftpos-credit-card-excessive-surcharges-banned-across-australia/8859100"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lee hsien loong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tharman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tharman shanmugaratnam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "monetary authority of singapore", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T04:32:56.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eecac822f759f015cbf2bd63f44681444f5530e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmGygHhAIvvbQ.WwDF3p8_ZmsYnuUT8dQ9geJs8hSrjn9cbC00kqH3RMyHxEvF9pp3KlJuMOEbBYaDo3ycZ4PMR.T18FIW3bghwX3LoyUuI0zvId.YOuA.JxIwxVFrV1Zmw--", "site_full": "www.zdnet.com", "site": "zdnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.zdnet.com/videos/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Latest Videos", "title": "Australian tablet sales fall due to easing demand for Android devices: Telsyte", "title_full": "Australian tablet sales fall due to easing demand for Android devices: Telsyte", "published": "2017-10-04T03:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/03/3422fd0c-c55d-43cf-80fa-f563d473db1a/thumbnail/770x578/94d63a5b47c9fee61e663eeda689365b/59d40a2260b2423cdd0f54c3-1280x7201oct032017234135poster.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1869, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eecac822f759f015cbf2bd63f44681444f5530e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmGygHhAIvvbQ.WwDF3p8_ZmsYnuUT8dQ9geJs8hSrjn9cbC00kqH3RMyHxEvF9pp3KlJuMOEbBYaDo3ycZ4PMR.T18FIW3bghwX3LoyUuI0zvId.YOuA.JxIwxVFrV1Zmw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T03:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Australian tablet sales fall due to easing demand for Android devices: Telsyte", "text": "Australian tablet sales fall due to easing demand for Android devices: Telsyte About Australian tablet sales fall due to easing demand for Android devices: Telsyte 1:16 / October 4, 2017 Australian tablet sales numbered 1.4 million for the first half of 2017, down 10 percent from a year prior, according to the research firm.

Due to a decision by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) striking down a European Union data retention directive in 2014, Ireland's laws in the area need to be modified to remain compliant.\nThe retained data is able to be currently accessed under a disclosure request by Irish Defence Forces, an officer of the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Irish Police), the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, or anyone with an appropriate court order or authorisation by the Data Protection Commissioner. The legislation also allows for individuals to request the data kept on them.\nThe former chief justice warned that safeguards in place for state authorities to access retained data could be undermined by those agencies believing they are entitled to the data if it is deemed useful by them.\n\"Access to a person's private historical communications data is an intrusion on their rights and on data which is personal to them,\" Murray said. \"Mere utility or potential utility is not the test.\n\"The potential threat to fundamental rights and freedoms arising from the statutory rights of access to retained data by state investigatory authorities is especially concerning.\"\nUnder proposals released by the Irish Minister for Justice and Equality Charlie Flanagan on Tuesday, the disclosure of data to the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and other agencies would only occur after judicial authorisation is acquired; however, the proposals also allow for the minister to unilaterally extend the categories of data being retained.\n\"It is important that Ireland's data retention laws remain robust and are updated in line with evolving case law coming from the ECJ,\" Flanagan said. \"The ECJ has identified difficulties with the model that EU member states use to manage law enforcement access to communications data.\n\"All EU states will have to have regard to the evolving legislative landscape, and I want Ireland to be in the vanguard.\"\nUK Home Secretary not deterred by failing to understand end-to-end encryption UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd has said that WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption communication services allow paedophiles and organised crime groups to operate beyond the reach of the law.\nAfter four militant attacks in Britain killed 36 people this year, senior ministers have repeatedly demanded internet companies do more to suppress extremist content and allow access to encrypted communications.\n\"I do not accept it is right that companies should allow them and other criminals to operate beyond the reach of law enforcement,\" Rudd said. \"We must require the industry to move faster and more aggressively. They have the resources and there must be greater urgency.\"\nRudd also called on technology giants such as Facebook , Google, Microsoft, and Twitter to go further and faster to counter extremist material.\nAccording to a report by the BBC, Rudd responded to an audience question on whether she understands end-to-end encryption by stating it is \"so easy\" to be patronised in such areas, and that the government would do its best to understand.\n\"We will take advice from other people, but I do feel that there is a sea of criticism for any of us who try and legislate in new areas who will automatically be sneered at and laughed at for not getting it right,\" the BBC reported Rudd as saying.\n\"I don't need to understand how encryption works to understand how it's helping ... the criminals.\"\nFor its part, the tech industry says it wants to help governments remove extremist or criminal material but also has to balance the demands of state security with the freedoms enshrined in democratic societies.\nBritain's MI5 security service has said it needs access to encrypted communications to foil attacks. In the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has pushed for full access to encrypted communications and devices, but Congress has so far refused.\nAustralia is currently planning to create a national facial surveillance database , and has previously said it wants to deny encryption to terrorists .\nWith AAP\nTech Pro Research IT leader\u2019s guide to the threat of fileless malware Network security policy Lunch and learn: BYOD rules and responsibilities Guidelines for building security policies Security awareness and training policy", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.techproresearch.com/downloads/network-security-policy/", "http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Review_of_the_Law_on_Retention_of_and_Access_to_Communications_Data.pdf/Files/Review_of_the_Law_on_Retention_of_and_Access_to_Communications_Data.pdf", "http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41463401", "http://www.techproresearch.com/downloads/security-awareness-and-training-policy/", "http://www.techproresearch.com/downloads/lunch-and-learn-byod-rules-and-responsibilities/", "http://www.techproresearch.com/downloads/guidelines-for-building-security-policies/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john l murray", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "flanagan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amber rudd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garda s\u00edoch\u00e1na", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rudd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie flanagan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murray", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "consumer protection commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irish minister for justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "revenue commissioners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aap tech pro research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal bureau of investigation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european court of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garda s\u00edoch\u00e1na", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T05:51:00.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37695eba597cda6a8b9e247f90a37e6a19077cca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmNJj7p0ZI8H0YtP8z3xQDwAaJYt9AWYSX1I9OqAQvUZIWJiRyOPrJoHoC9ReDBMz5KcWIw_fRbwwlDvx55wFx8M-", "site_full": "www.zdnet.com", "site": "zdnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.zdnet.com/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Technology News, Analysis, Comments and Product Reviews for IT Professionals | ZDNet", "title": "Intel former CEO Paul Otellini dies in sleep", "title_full": "Intel former CEO Paul Otellini dies in sleep | ZDNet", "published": "2017-10-04T09:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/04/6024495e-b776-4089-8a17-f25aa4351759/thumbnail/770x578/266cb99f68b30c1854432263292c9cab/paulotelliniwafer.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1869, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 20, "comments": 0, "shares": 20}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "37695eba597cda6a8b9e247f90a37e6a19077cca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmNJj7p0ZI8H0YtP8z3xQDwAaJYt9AWYSX1I9OqAQvUZIWJiRyOPrJoHoC9ReDBMz5KcWIw_fRbwwlDvx55wFx8M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tom Foremski", "published": "2017-10-04T09:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Intel former CEO Paul Otellini dies in sleep", "text": "Former Intel CEO Paul Otellini dies in sleep Paul Otellini was almost 67 and spent his entire professional life at Intel. 0 \nPaul Otellini, the former CEO of Intel, the world's second largest chipmaker, died in his sleep the company announced Tuesday -- he was nearly 67 years old. \nHis retirement from Intel in May 2013 capped nearly 40 years working at Intel. He was on the fast track early in his career as Technical Assistant to Andy Grove, CEO and Chairman, and then served in key leadership positions in Intel's business groups. \nOtellini was Intel's fifth CEO but the first chief executive without a technical background. He was also the first Intel CEO to retire suddenly, leaving the board to scramble in a search for his successor. Intel's CEOs are forced to retire at 65 years old and then transition to a chairman role. \nThere is always a planned succession but Otellini surprised the board with his early retirement And he did not serve as Chairman. \nHe was replaced by Brian Krzanich -- an executive with an engineering background. \nKrzanich said, \"He was the relentless voice of the customer in a sea of engineers, and he taught us that we only win when we put the customer first.\" \nHis legacy at Intel stands out in several ways. During Otellini's tenure Intel was the world's largest chipmaker. Earlier this year it lost the top spot to Samsung. \nHe laid off about 10,500 staff in 2006 -- the company's largest layoffs. \nHe admits he missed the importance of the smartphone market where rival ARM scored major design wins. \nAnd several business initiatives had to be closed or scaled back including the Itanium microprocessor -- which cost billions of dollars to develop and support. \nIntel's $7.68 billion acquisition of McAfee security software firm in 2010 was spun out earlier this year in a joint venture with private investment fund TPG. \nHe was also a current member of Google's Board of Directors. \nFrom Intel : Paul and his wife, Sandy, were married for 30 years. He is survived by his wife; his son, Patrick; and his daughter, Alexis. Since he retired in 2013, Otellini dedicated time to mentoring young people and being involved with several philanthropic and charitable organizations, including the San Francisco Symphony and San Francisco General Hospital Foundation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

unanimously recommended the acceptance of 360 Capital's offer to acquire remaining shares in the property trust for AU$1.95 a share.\nA spokesperson from APDC said it's now up to its shareholders to accept or decline the offer, which is scheduled to close on November 6, 2017.\nThe latest board recommendation comes a little over a month after it supported the AU$1.87-per-share offer put forth by rival bidder NextDC in July out of concern around 360 Capital as a potential landlord .\nNextDC at the same said it would be paying approximately AU$215 million from its existing cash reserves within five business days of receiving formal shareholder approval.\n360 Capital then on September 15 updated its proposal, increasing its per-share price from AU$1.80 to AU$1.95, as well as making the offer unconditional to \"give certainty\" to shareholders.\nThe property trust's offer represents a 24.6 percent premium over APDC's closing share price of AU$1.565 on May 1 -- the day before it acquired its initial 19.8 percent stake in APDC -- and a 3.7 percent premium over NextDC's last offer of $1.87 per share.\nAPDC's share price rose the day 360 Capital submitted its latest bid, at one point reaching AU$1.965 per share, it said in a disclosure to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).\nAccording to APDC's board, the latest offer \"exceeds the fair market value range\" based on advice from third-party experts.\nThe board additionally said that if 360 Capital's bid is unsuccessful, and no better proposal is submitted, \"there is a risk that the price of APDC securities may trade below the offer price of AU$1.95.\"\nIn a bidder's statement, 360 Capital said it intends to remove APDC from the ASX and replace its board of directors once it acquires 90 percent of shares, or is in a position to cast the majority of votes at a general meeting with APDC shareholders.\n360 Capital had called for and eventually withdrew a meeting to oust APDC's management and take over the leadership in July, claiming at the time that APDC and NextDC had both refused to engage in its proposal.\nNextDC had criticised 360 Capital's initial offer for being \"highly conditional\" and reflecting \"poor corporate governance\".\n360 Capital's subsequent acquisition proposal had removed the caveat of replacing APDC's board of directors.\nNextDC, which is the sole tenant of APDC's datacentre facilities in Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth, recently increased its share of voting stock from 25.6 percent to more than 29 percent, but has not provided any indication to ZDNet as to whether it will be submitting a new offer.\nRahul Badethalav, investor relations manager at NextDC, had previously told ZDNet that there are \"meaningful benefits\" for customers in being the datacentre operator as well as the owner of the land that sits underneath the datacentres.\n\"Naturally, given our datacentres sit on the land itself, it would be a fairly straightforward transaction to make,\" he said in July.\n360 Capital said it would be funding the acquisition through its existing cash reserves and borrowings within seven business days of receiving formal acceptance by APDC shareholders.\nAs of June 30, 2017, APDC reported its three Australian datacentres in Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth are valued at AU$212.8 million, up 13.8 percent from AU$187 million in the 2016-17 financial year. Separately, M1 is valued at AU$80 million, S1 at AU$95.3 million, and P1 at AU$37.5 million.\nIn its full-year financial report, APDC reported a 16.5 percent surge in profit from AU$31.7 million in the 2015-16 financial year to a record AU$36.9 million in the 2016-17 financial year.\nLatest Australian news NBN launches new Sky Muster plans with more data \u200bFacial surveillance on the cards in the name of Australia's national security Australians made over 2,000 privacy complaints to Commissioner in 2016-17 NBN should use as much fibre as possible: Joint committee Privacy Commissioner publishes data breach notification guidelines for comment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rahul badethalav", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nextdc asia pacific data centre group", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "capital", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "apdc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nextdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zdnet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sky muster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "securities exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "perth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T05:51:21.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13a94e5de5ca38ecbf1dd6fbe38d08d599a26ceb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmNJj7p0ZI8H01SHJZSc6spnzHhi3oV4QEqEhFFnpKkiGv9qBu8yMsiFP7_ibyuax_LlraXUNw2jB9iEsvucjubnYmlN1jAAmcprViD4NSPn3D5MGHi8Vz2k-", "site_full": "www.zdnet.com", "site": "zdnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.zdnet.com/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Technology News, Analysis, Comments and Product Reviews for IT Professionals | ZDNet", "title": "\u200bBank of Queensland: The sector is getting better at sharing information", "title_full": "\u200bBank of Queensland: The sector is getting better at sharing information | ZDNet", "published": "2017-10-04T11:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/05/30/08d94575-9fca-4d44-9137-a558bf9bf671/thumbnail/770x578/28a2d1b510dbc6f0c3cb4900b5178130/istock-600402522.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1869, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 93}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13a94e5de5ca38ecbf1dd6fbe38d08d599a26ceb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmNJj7p0ZI8H01SHJZSc6spnzHhi3oV4QEqEhFFnpKkiGv9qBu8yMsiFP7_ibyuax_LlraXUNw2jB9iEsvucjubnYmlN1jAAmcprViD4NSPn3D5MGHi8Vz2k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Asha McLean", "published": "2017-10-04T11:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u200bBank of Queensland: The sector is getting better at sharing information", "text": "0 \nBank of Queensland (BoQ) claims to be Australia's seventh largest bank, with business from about one-third of the state. Although the financial services sector in Australia is largely dominated by four major banks, which combined hold a 95 percent share of the industry, BoQ chief risk officer Peter Deans said the sector is getting better at not isolating itself from other players in the area of cybersecurity. \n\"I think a couple of years ago the banking sector tended not to talk too much to each other about cyber threats -- it was a little bit of a closed shop, certainly within the larger institutions, it was almost seen as a bit of a competitive edge to be safer than the bank or the shop next door,\" Deans told the SINET61 conference in Sydney last week. \n\"I think the last couple of years that's completely gone and I think that whole concept of competing trust has gone away.\" \nAccording to Deans, the past 12 months has seen the sector communicating and sharing more information, including security concerns and threat intelligence. He touched on government playing a part in instigating cross-bank communication. \n\"What we've seen that has been good in the last 12 months -- and I think government has played a bit part in this -- has been fostering a lot more dialogue and sharing of information that actually is helping us as both an individual participant in the payments and commerce sector, as well as relying on our external business partners and banks we deal with everyday,\" he said. \n\"I think there's a lot more acceptance that everyone needs to share and be a lot more open. That's been a pleasing thing for 2017.\" \nHowever, it's not just finance-related information sharing. \n\"For us, we're trying to look at ways to make sure that we as an organisation are resilient over the business, so we don't lose customer data and customers' money obviously,\" he said. \nTo Deans, businesses in the sector and the critical infrastructure community have come a long way when it comes to information sharing. \n\"I think in a lot of areas such as cybersecurity, data privacy, the risk appetite is very low, if not nil,\" he said. \n\"I think when you talk about critical infrastructure, risk appetite is pretty much near zero.\" \nHe said, however, that when an organisation introduces a risk-based approach in-house and conducts risk assessments \"everyone does get a little bit carried away\". \n\"You need to really look at the scenarios that happen,\" he explained. \"If something goes wrong when you've adopted a risk-based approach, it's really quite problematic.\" \nFor the first half of the 2017 financial year, BoQ reported a 6 percent year-on-year drop in after-tax profit to AU$161 million . \nBoQ reported AU$252 million in operating expenses for the six-month period, which included a AU$55 million spend on IT-related initiatives, such as a new application programming interface (API) gateway the bank said will make it easier and faster for BoQ and its partners to develop new mobile capabilities in the future. \nA recent report from Capgemini suggested that banks address the \"threat of disruption\" by combining their strengths with those of fintech startups, with one such method being to open up APIs to other players. \nAccording to the consultancy firm, the future success of banks will require a shift towards a more open banking model, which will result in \"uncorking the creativity\" of third parties and generating opportunities the industry has not experienced before.

SpeedScript Keyboard is non predictive, so it does not use autocorrect and autocomplete like other keyboard apps (Swype, Swiftkey,). Write how you think without annoying outside interference. SpeedScript Keyboard protects your privacy. The app doesn't read or save your data like other keyboard apps (Swype, SwiftKey,). Autocorrect? Autocomplete? Predictive? No thanks. Apart from being efficient and easy to use, SpeedScript Keyboard spares users the annoying and sometimes embarrassing help given by autocorrect and autocomplete systems. And by concentrating entirely on ergonomic and linguistic optimization it avoids the sinister privacy issues of text entry systems that trawl the cloud and the user's smartphone to achieve a usable recognition rate. The paid SpeedScript Keyboard does not need any permissions at all. The SpeedScript Keyboard Free version accesses advertising networks and requires acceptance of carefully delimited permissions, but SpeedScript Keyboard keeps your privacy, it does not read or store any information, including information provided in connection with the advertising (which comes from German ad network bundler AddApptr). This makes SpeedScript Keyboard the obvious choice for users who value their privacy and want to limit their exposure to the dark side of the cloud. How does SpeedScript Keyboard make text entry quicker and more efficient? SpeedScript Keyboard strikes the golden mean by combining writing and typing on a touchscreen. In any language, vowels and spaces account for around half of all characters used. According to SpeedScript Keyboard logic, it must be possible to write these frequent characters quickly and easily without having to search for the right key and move the finger too far. So SpeedScript Keyboard enables you to write strokes in eight different directions from any character key on the keyboard: a stroke to the left produces an \"a, \" a stroke downward an \"i, \" a stroke to the right a \"u, \" and so on. Starting from the blue key you can write single vowels and a single space. SpeedScript Keyboard also gives direct access to symbols like ' \" [ ] { } <> % # &. . and to special functions such as page up, page down, home, end, cut, copy and paste, and arrows for navigation in the text. The symbols and functions are grouped together thematically: punctuation, mathematical symbols, parentheses, smileys, currency symbols, navigation in the text, and even cut, copy, and paste. SpeedScript Keyboard's compact and efficient QWERTY designSpeedScript Keyboard uses a QWERTY layout without the keys for vowels. In a standard QWERTY layout, most of the vowels are near the edge. SpeedScript Keyboard takes advantage of this to compress the QWERTY keyboard without losing its familiar layout. The remaining keys are still positioned in almost the same positions relative to each other. The SpeedScript Keyboard QWERTY design has only 22 keys instead of 27, giving a better overview and making it easier to locate the desired key. Because of the reduced number of keys, the keyboard is eight rather than ten keys wide. This makes a big difference: the keys are 56% bigger, which makes it a lot easier to hit the target key. Usability tests have shown that people can find and hit keys faster using the compact SpeedScript layout than with the standard QWERTY layout.
