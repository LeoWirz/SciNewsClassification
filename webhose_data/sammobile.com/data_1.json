The company normally details monthly patches in the first week. This security maintenance release will thus be released soon for major flagship models as part of Samsung\u2019s monthly Security Maintenance Release process. Samsung October 2017 Security Patch \nThe latest security patch from Samsung includes fixes for 215 vulnerabilities found in Google\u2019s Android operating system. Google issued the fixes for these vulnerabilities with the October 2017 Android Security Bulletin. All of those fixes are included in Samsung\u2019s latest release. \nThe Samsung October 2017 security patch also brings fixes for six vulnerabilities that Samsung found in its own software. Samsung has only detailed a couple of them. The rest have been privately disclosed so as to prevent abuse as it will take a few weeks before this update is rolled out to all compatible devices. \nWe can expect this update to be released for flagship handsets like the Galaxy Note 8 , Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in the next week or so. Devices like the Galaxy S7 , Galaxy S6 and Galaxy A5 (2017) will get it later this month as well. \nThe Samsung October 2017 security patch will bump up most devices from the August patch.

The renders revealed that this Windows Mixed Reality headset featured integrated AKG headphones . No further information was available at that point in time about this product. \nIt was expected that the headset would be unveiled on October 2. That\u2019s because Microsoft had a Windows Mixed Reality event scheduled for today. Sure enough, Samsung today announced its Odyssey Windows Mixed Reality headset. Samsung Odyssey Windows Mixed Reality Headset \nSince this is a Windows Mixed Reality headset, users will require a compatible Windows 10-powered PC for the headset to function. While similar headsets from other manufacturers have LCD panels, Samsung\u2019s headset has dual 3.5-inch AMOLED panels with a combined resolution of 2880\u00d71600. The resolution is much higher than the 1440\u00d71440 resolution found in other Windows Mixed Reality headsets. \nIt doesn\u2019t restrict users to a limited space during their VR experience as the Samsung Odyssey headset has inside-out position tracking with a Six Degrees of Freedom sensor. \nThere\u2019s an up to 110-degree field of view and refresh rate of up to 90Hz. The headset has integrated AKG headphones and dual array mics. It supports 360\u00b0 Spatial Sound to provide users with complete surround sound. The fitted array mic enables users to talk to other gamers without having to remove the headset. \nIt ships with motion controllers that offer complete freedom of movement. The controllers feature haptic feedback, thumbsticks and button control for easy navigation. \nJust in case you were wondering, no, your Samsung flagship smartphone isn\u2019t compatible with the headset. This is the first headset from Samsung that has not been built in partnership with Facebook-owned Oculus. \nThe Samsung Odyssey Windows Mixed Reality headset will be available for pre-order later today. Samsung has priced it at $499. The headset is going to be released in the United States, China, Korea, Brazil and Hong Kong this year.

The Nokia N85 was launched in August 2008, and the Samsung i7710 followed in October in the same year, with both of them featuring a similarly-sized screen and resolution. Both Nokia and Samsung continued releasing phones with AMOLED screens. Other brands, including HTC and LG, also started using OLED technology in their phones over the years. \nWhile OLED screen technology offered great contrast, wide viewing angles, and thin panels, it came with a few caveats. First and foremost, the panels weren\u2019t bright enough, and they suffered from something called \u2018screen burn-in\u2019. Moreover, the colour reproduction was far from accurate and power efficiency went for a toss while displaying whites. It took a few years for OLED panel makers to iron out these issues, and Samsung was at the forefront of solving them. The brightness levels went from around 400 nits on the Galaxy S to more than 600 nits on the Galaxy S5 and over 1,200 nits on the Galaxy Note 8 . Samsung didn\u2019t just stop there. It introduced the Galaxy Note Edge as the first phone with a curved edge screen, which was then introduced and improved on with the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S7, ultimately ending up as the beautiful Infinity Display we see on the Galaxy S8 and Note 8. \nDisplayMate , a screen testing and calibration equipment manufacturer, tested all the recent flagship phones from Samsung and noted that the colour accuracy was brilliant and has consistently rated the company\u2019s AMOLED displays as the best in the industry . AU Optronics, BOE Display, Everdisplay, Foxconn, JDI, Sharp, Truly, and Visionox are some of the new brands that have started manufacturing OLED screens. However, Samsung\u2019s OLED panels for mobile devices are considered the best in the world, thanks to the time and research the company has invested over the years. LG is the company\u2019s closest competitor and it recently launched its flagship phone, the V30, with a bezel-less P-OLED screen, but it is far from perfect . \nNow, nine years after Samsung\u2019s first OLED phone, Apple has jumped onto the OLED bandwagon. The iPhone X is Apple\u2019s first phone with an OLED screen and minimal bezels (although the Cupertino giant has managed to ruin symmetry by going overboard with the no-bezel theme ). Apple is known to source parts from nothing but the best, and it has turned to Samsung for a reason. The newest-generation OLED panels from Samsung have great color accuracy, can go extremely bright, and cover a wide variety of color spaces. Screen burn-in has also been greatly reduced, and power efficiency has only increased with each passing year. \nIt\u2019s taken a few years to get here, but there\u2019s no question that Samsung\u2019s persistence has paid off in ways beneficial to both the company and its consumers. And, while Samsung\u2019s position in the OLED display segment remains unchallenged, it isn\u2019t resting on its laurels. We see the company make noticeable improvements to its flagship phone displays every six months, and it\u2019s even planning to launch a foldable phone next year . Making a phone with a foldable screen would be no easy task, but should Samsung manage to do it satisfactorily, it would be close to impossible for other brands to imitate. Apple is finally making a phone with an OLED display, but it will probably see its chief competitor change the game with its foldable phone before the second OLED-equipped iPhone makes it to market. \nWhat I\u2019m getting to with this article is that Samsung\u2019s lead in smartphone display technology is unmatched, and the company shows no signs of stopping in its relentless pursuit to perfect the viewing experience on mobile devices. Galaxy flagships offer tons of features that make them impressive, but those stunning displays up front are what continue to attract millions of consumers.

at DxOMark Home / News / Galaxy Note 8 camera test ends in tie with the iPhone 8 Plus at DxOMark Adnan F. / 1 day ago \nDxOMark, a camera reference publication, tested the iPhone 8 Plus camera last month and declared it as the \u201cbest smartphone camera.\u201d It has now published its report on the Galaxy Note 8 camera test. Samsung\u2019s new flagship smartphone has tied with the iPhone 8 Plus. DxOMark awarded both handsets a score of 94. \nThe Galaxy Note 8 is the first smartphone from Samsung to feature a dual camera. It has two 12-megapixel sensors aided by one wide-angle 26mm f/1.7 lens and one 52mm telephoto f/2.4 lens with x2 optical zoom. According to DxOMark, the Galaxy Note 8 offers \u201cthe best zoom capabilities\u201d of any mobile device it has tested so far. Galaxy Note 8 Camera Test Results \nTo achieve its Galaxy Note 8 camera test results, DxOMark captured and evaluated more than 1,500 test images and more than two hours of video in both controlled lab environments and natural indoor/outdoor scenes. \nAccording to the publication, the Galaxy Note 8 is the current class-leader for stills as it has excellent zoom quality, good noise reduction, detail preservation and accurate autofocus. Relatively noiseless low-light photography is a plus as well. \nDxoMark sings praises of the Galaxy Note 8\u2019s zoom. Aside from its x2 optical zoom lens , it\u2019s capable of taking shots at x8 digital zoom as well. Even though less detail is captured at x8 digital zoom, the images were found to be very usable. \nWhat this Galaxy Note 8 camera test tells you is that your Galaxy Note 8 is great for portraits, low-light photography and capturing fast-moving scenes. It\u2019s not that it underperforms in other aspects, these are just the qualities that stand out. \nThe fact remains, though, that the camera is just part of the equation. You have to like other things about a smartphone as well before you decide to spend over $1,000 on it. If you\u2019re still on the fence, perhaps our Galaxy Note 8 review can help change your mind.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dxomark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dxomark", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T10:59:58.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "39646b5e1830f8291240f3594c8d6e7ec49bfe85", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRheeYS1OHGD72iIntCOZOyI4TIvB9icceRE3XAhjJuXNBgdI3Y2RpVJ1wERymz.IE-", "site_full": "www.sammobile.com", "site": "sammobile.com", "site_section": "https://www.sammobile.com/forum/", "site_categories": ["shopping", "business"], "section_title": "SamMobile", "title": "[General] SM-A300XU retail mode", "title_full": "[General] SM-A300XU retail mode", "published": "2017-10-04T10:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.144, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2971, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "39646b5e1830f8291240f3594c8d6e7ec49bfe85", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRheeYS1OHGD72iIntCOZOyI4TIvB9icceRE3XAhjJuXNBgdI3Y2RpVJ1wERymz.IE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "oggi21", "published": "2017-10-04T10:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "[General] SM-A300XU retail mode", "text": "Thank You.

The ultimate goal was apparently to get the chipmaker to reduce royalty payments, this according to documents filed by Qualcomm in court. \nBloomberg reports that a senior Apple executive, possibly CEO Tim Cook, had a word with a senior counterpart at an industry conference in Idaho two years ago. The Samsung executive was likely Lee Jae-yong, the recently incarcerated vice chairman of the conglomerate. No Love Lost \nThere is no love lost between the two companies. Samsung and Apple have been involved in their own patent disputes for years. However, they also have a working relationship which sees Samsung supplying billions of dollars in parts to Apple. It\u2019s also Apple\u2019s ally in another patent dispute with Qualcomm. \nQualcomm\u2019s court filing alleged that the Apple executive urged his Samsung counterpart to put pressure on antitrust regulators in Soth Korea to intensify an interrogation into Qualcomm that they had been conducting since 2014. \u201cGet aggressive,\u201d the Apple executive apparently said. \nQualcomm was ultimately hit with a $912.34 million fine in December 2016 by the Korea Fair Trade Commission and was also directed to improve how it handles patent licensing and chip sales. The company appealed the ruling but it was shot down by the Seoul High Court. \nThe allegation in Qualcomm\u2019s filings that Apple got Samsung to use its influence with the government in South Korea to pressure regulators to go after Qualcomm is troubling. This was before Samsung found itself involved in an unrelated anticorruption probe that led to the ouster of former president Park Geun-hye and the incarceration of Lee Jae-yong. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know what conversation they are talking about,\u201d said Apple\u2019s general counsel Bruce Sewell, adding that \u201cFor Apple to have said to Samsung, \u2018You guys are in Korea and you should be watching this case carefully,\u2019 doesn\u2019t seem to me to be anything beyond simply the kind of conversation two CEOs might have.\u201d \nSamsung declined to comment.

While that\u2019s going to be enough for some users, most users will just pop in a microSD card. If you\u2019re using one, here\u2019s how you encrypt Galaxy Note 8 microSD card. You should certainly do it if you want to keep the data on the card secure. \nThe data that\u2019s stored on the internal storage is secure as long as your phone is locked. You can secure it using various features, including but not limited to facial and iris recognition . That protection doesn\u2019t extend to the microSD card as it can simply be removed by ejecting the SIM tray. They can then pop it in another device or in a computer and get access to all of your data. \nIf you encrypt Galaxy Note 8 microSD card, then the data will only be accessible via the phone when it\u2019s unlocked. It will have to be decrypted first before it can be used with another device. \nYou will not be able to use the microSD card elsewhere before decrypting it on the Galaxy Note 8. Follow the same steps in reverse to decrypt it. How To Encrypt Galaxy Note 8 MicroSD Card \nStep 1: Launch the Settings app on your Galaxy Note 8 and tap on Lock screen and security \nStep 2: Scroll down to locate the Encrypt SD Card option \nStep 3: Tap Encrypt SD Card to begin the process. If you use one, you will have to enter your password or pattern for the process to begin. \nDo keep in mind that encryption can take an hour or more, it depends on how much content is stored on there.

Following DxOMark\u2019s announcement yesterday that the Galaxy Note 8 is the \u201cbest smartphone for zoom\u201d , we decided to put together a few samples of pictures we\u2019ve captured using 2x optical zoom on the phone to see how it works in real-life scenarios. We\u2019ve put the zoomed-in samples next to their standard counterparts so you can get an idea of what the optical zoom can offer. \nFor those who need a refresher, the Galaxy Note 8 comes with two 12-megapixel cameras at the back, one a standard 26mm wide-angle lens with f/1.7 aperture, Dual Pixel autofocus, and optical image stabilization (OIS), and the other a 52 mm telephoto lens with f/2.4 aperture and OIS. The telephoto lens is what makes these optical zoom shots possible, in addition to pictures with DSLR-like bokeh effects through the Live Focus feature, samples of which we had already published in a separate article a couple of weeks ago. \nWell, without further ado, go ahead and check out the samples below, and let us know what you think! To view the 2x zoom shot, move the slider left, and move it right to see the regular version. \nEdit : We have also uploaded all these images as separate files in this Google Photos album for those who want to see them in a larger size (something our compare plugin doesn\u2019t currently allow).

Just in case you have though, here\u2019s a quick refresher: enhanced notifications, stricter application permissions, additional emoji and refined battery saving tools. It also bundles a number of routine bug fixes, stability improvements and speed optimizations. \nTo check to see if the update is ready for your Galaxy J5 Prime , open up Settings , hit About Device , then select Download Updates Manually . Alternatively, you can wait until you receive a push notification prompting you to install the over-the-air update, though that typically takes a little longer to arrive and often won\u2019t present itself unless your handset has at least 50 percent of battery. \nThanks, Ramesh!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T16:10:20.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a93c90e83f55605faf0032d9bd49bc6d9a491f97", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQDz2Ek7FrppsQumlxuQz2SnonLHyEG9BQjXj1vshEUh.2ANTIYwuaEGMPilC6aPHHv1LpVo9BbpyC2fziOvjOBtRyJ3sbUKVFBz8slf6VyLWuj6L7QCWIo", "site_full": "sammobile.com", "site": "sammobile.com", "site_section": "http://www.sammobile.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "SamMobile", "title": "Daily Deal: Grab Samsung\u2019s USB-C to HDMI Adapter for 20% off", "title_full": "Daily Deal: Grab Samsung\u2019s USB-C to HDMI Adapter for 20% off", "published": "2017-10-05T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.sammobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/USB-C-HDMI-Adapter-720x416.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2971, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a93c90e83f55605faf0032d9bd49bc6d9a491f97", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQDz2Ek7FrppsQumlxuQz2SnonLHyEG9BQjXj1vshEUh.2ANTIYwuaEGMPilC6aPHHv1LpVo9BbpyC2fziOvjOBtRyJ3sbUKVFBz8slf6VyLWuj6L7QCWIo", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Josh L.", "published": "2017-10-05T13:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Daily Deal: Grab Samsung\u2019s USB-C to HDMI Adapter for 20% off", "text": "Daily Deal: Grab Samsung\u2019s USB-C to HDMI Adapter for 20% off Home / News / Daily Deal: Grab Samsung\u2019s USB-C to HDMI Adapter for 20% off Josh L. / 15 hours ago \nFor a limited time only, you can bag yourself Samsung\u2019s USB-C to HDMI Adapter, which lets you view movies and pictures stored on your smartphone on televisions and monitors, for $39.95 (20% off). \nIf you like the sound of this promotion and want to take advantage of it, hit the Buy Now button below.

Well, as much as I hate to say it, GIFs have gradually become a staple of online communication\u2014and if you aren\u2019t using them now, chances are you will be within a few months, so we\u2019ve put together this guide to prepare you for when you inevitably do. How do I make a GIF on the Galaxy Note 8? \nStep 1: When you\u2019ve opened the application/video you want to turn into a GIF, detach the S Pen, then tap Smart Select. \nStep 2: Choose Animation . \nStep 3: Use the S Pen to specify the area you want to record. \nStep 4: Hit Record . \nStep 5: Once your GIF has finished recording, select either Save or Share \u2014or Draw if you want to annotate it. A couple of things to note GIFs can be up to 15-seconds in length. Some applications prevent you from turning content into GIFs, though it\u2019s rare you\u2019ll find one that does. Stuck? \nIf you happen to encounter any issues while following our instructions, feel free to reach out to us in the comments section below and we\u2019ll do our best to get you back on track.

Its new flagship smartphone, the Galaxy Note 7, would combust spontaneously. It recalled the initial batch of units and made tweaks but that didn\u2019t do it any good. Samsung ultimately had to issue a second recall and discontinue the product. \nThe rumors about the future of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note lineup began. Some analysts felt that the Galaxy Note 7 recall had caused permanent damage to Samsung\u2019s reputation. Others were sounding alarm bells for the company\u2019s smartphone business. However, Samsung bounced back in spectacular fashion this year. Galaxy Note 7 Recall \nSamsung\u2019s head of global brand marketing for the mobile business Pio Schunker that the company was in the midst of a rebrand of sorts when the Galaxy Note 7 crisis hit. He was speaking at the ANA\u2019s Masters of Marketing Conference in Orlando. \nSamsung had been working to revamp its image with ads that humanized the brand and connected with people on a global scale. The company\u2019s 2016 Rio Olympics ad was cited as an example of this by Schunker. \nHe added that Samsung was seeing signs of success from its efforts to revamp the brand. However, it all went south due to the Galaxy Note 7 recall. \n\u201cJust when things were starting to go right, things went horribly wrong,\u201d he said. Samsung suddenly faced its biggest challenge yet. A flagship product with a defective battery that threatened to permanently damage its business and reputation. \nSamsung\u2019s first priority was to rebuild trust. It detailed the root cause at a special press conference in January this year. It also detailed its new battery safety measures at the press conference. \u201cSlowly, over the next few months, we saw the company trust begin to recover and then begin to stabilize,\u201d Schunker said. \nSamsung was then gearing up to launch the Galaxy S8 , its first flagship after the Galaxy Note 7 recall. Schunker said that the stakes were much higher with the marketing direction. Samsung had to \u201crecover and repair all the damage that had happened over the previous months.\u201d \nNot only did the company\u2019s new flagship leave everyone impressed, Samsung also released moving ads that humanized its brand. They included Samsung\u2019s award-winning ostrich ad that promoted the Gear VR headset. \nSchunker mentioned that Samsung\u2019s ads were part of the plan to rebuild its brand after the Galaxy Note 7 recall. The response it has seen so far for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 suggests that the Galaxy Note 7 hasn\u2019t cast a long shadow.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T16:48:36.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5f18667d887fbf8e20873f470a12bd9921d3109", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQDz2Ek7FrppsQumlxuQz2SnonLHyEG9BQtYtF4zCEF36evaYr7sL8RuYcLr5S5lW3sQS1J60Nr7ISO.DirppyXlwXvDBgjHiOfxTMuiRZaKzD5kBkgR7hQ", "site_full": "sammobile.com", "site": "sammobile.com", "site_section": "http://www.sammobile.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "SamMobile", "title": "Apple vs Samsung review request should be denied, says US DOJ", "title_full": "Apple vs Samsung review request should be denied, says US DOJ", "published": "2017-10-06T10:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.sammobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/lawsuit-720x469.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2971, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f5f18667d887fbf8e20873f470a12bd9921d3109", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQDz2Ek7FrppsQumlxuQz2SnonLHyEG9BQtYtF4zCEF36evaYr7sL8RuYcLr5S5lW3sQS1J60Nr7ISO.DirppyXlwXvDBgjHiOfxTMuiRZaKzD5kBkgR7hQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adnan F.", "published": "2017-10-06T10:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apple vs Samsung review request should be denied, says US DOJ", "text": "Apple vs Samsung review request should be denied, says US DOJ Home / News / Apple vs Samsung review request should be denied, says US DOJ Adnan F. / 18 hours ago \nThe Apple vs Samsung lawsuit has been an epic legal battle between the two tech giants.

It was a 2014 verdict which had held Samsung responsible for patent infringement and awarded $120 million in damages to Apple. Samsung filed a petition for a writ of certiorari before the court. That\u2019s when you approach a higher court to review the decision of a lower court. \nIt appears that the United States Department of Justice has had enough of this legal battle. It wants the Supreme Court to deny Samsung\u2019s petition. \u201cIn the view of the United States, the petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied,\u201d the DOJ said in a filing. \nWhether the Supreme Court actually denies the petition remains to be seen.
