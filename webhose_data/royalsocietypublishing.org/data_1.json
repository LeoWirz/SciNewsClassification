A three-dimensional linear model of ocean wave scattering by a finite array of compliant circular ice floes is coupled to a flexural failure model, which breaks a floe into two floes provided the two-dimensional stress field satisfies a break-up criterion. A closed-feedback loop algorithm is devised, which (i) solves the wave-scattering problem for a given FSD under time-harmonic plane wave forcing, (ii) computes the stress field in all the floes, (iii) fractures the floes satisfying the break-up criterion, and (iv) generates an updated FSD, initializing the geometry for the next iteration of the loop. The FSD after 50 break-up events is unimodal and near normal, or bimodal, suggesting waves alone do not govern the power law observed in some field studies. Multiple scattering is found to enhance break-up for long waves and thin ice, but to reduce break-up for short waves and thick ice. A break-up front marches forward in the latter regime, as wave-induced fracture weakens the ice cover, allowing waves to travel deeper into the MIZ. 1. Introduction The Arctic marginal ice zone (MIZ) that separates open ocean from the interior pack ice is experiencing rapid changes as a result of high-latitude climate change. During summer, for example, its extent relative to the total sea ice area is expanding [ 1 ], suggesting an increasing presence of thinner, loosely packed ice floes. Changes in environmental forcings, e.g. heat, winds and ocean waves, acting in partnership with positive feedback processes, are responsible for this transformation. Ocean waves, in particular, have been observed to break up the sea ice under flexural failure and, therefore, to contribute to the increasing extent of the MIZ, which is, in turn, more sensitive to summer melting because of the increased total perimeter of the ice floes created [ 2 ]. Correspondingly, sea ice loss increases open water extent and allows for more energetic swell to develop in the Arctic Basin [ 3 , 4 ], with the potential to fracture the sea ice further and cause additional melting. Although indirect observational evidence of this positive feedback mechanism was proposed by Kohout et al. [ 5 ] in the Antarctic MIZ, its impact on sea ice extent has not been quantified. Modelling the two-way coupling between the wave and sea ice systems on oceanic scales is needed to remedy this shortcoming. The vast majority of modelling studies on ocean wave interactions with sea ice have attempted to quantify wave attenuation and directional spreading as a result of scattering [ 6 \u2013 9 ] and dissipation [ 10 , 11 ] by the constituent ice floes, within the scope of linear water wave theory. These effects have recently been parametrized in spectral wave models, e.g. WAVEWATCH III \u00ae , to complement the description of physical processes influencing ocean wave propagation on a global scale and assess the role sea ice has on wave climate in the polar seas [ 12 \u2013 16 ], acknowledging that the validity of such parametrizations is still the subject of much current research. By contrast, very little is known about the impact of ocean waves on the break-up of sea ice floes in the MIZ. Observations have shown that floe size distribution (FSD), defined as the statistical distribution of floe sizes (e.g. mean caliper diameter or diameter of a circular floe with the same surface area) in the MIZ, satisfies a power law for floes with size larger than O (10\u2013100\u2009m) [ 17 \u2013 19 ], while a regime shift often occurs for smaller floes. Although the latter regime has also been fitted to a power law, typically with a smaller power exponent than that fitted for large floes, uncertainty exists about whether scale invariance is a defining feature of the FSD. For instance, Herman [ 20 ] fitted a Pareto distribution to a collection of FSD datasets and was able to capture different scaling characteristics for small and large floe sizes. It is unclear how waves contribute to the emergence of these observed power-law regimes, as flexural failure is not expected to occur below a critical floe size of order O (10\u2009m) [ 21 ], which would suggest that the floe number distribution should decrease to zero as floes become small unless other break-up mechanisms are imposed. In this study, we address this question by modelling the break-up of an ice cover under a sustained wave event, with the goal of establishing the FSD emerging from wave forcing alone, i.e. isolated from wind, collisions and any other sources of sea ice break-up. Very few models have attempted to describe the break-up of sea ice in the MIZ due to waves alone. Dumont et al. [ 22 ] were the first to propose a numerical model for the transport of ocean waves in the MIZ due to scattering by the constituent ice floes, in which a parametrization of ice floe break-up was included. In each cell of the discretized spatial domain, the FSD was described by a power law and parametrized by its minimum, mean and maximum floe size. At each time step, the FSD was updated according to a break-up criterion (discussed later) depending on wave amplitude in the cell and floes repeatedly fracturing in half with a prescribed probability, preserving the power-law distribution. Williams et al. [ 23 , 24 ] extended the work of Dumont et al. [ 22 ] by considering a more realistic break-up criterion, but used the same parametrization of the FSD. These authors focused their analysis on estimating the maximum distance from the ice edge where break-up can take place, which they define as the MIZ width, and did not examine the evolution of the power-law FSD during the break-up process. Implementation of two-way coupling between large-scale sea ice models, e.g. CICE or neXtSIM, and spectral wave models based on these modelling approaches is currently being investigated [ 25 , 26 ]. Other modelling studies have considered the evolution of the FSD in the framework of large-scale sea ice models. Horvat & Tziperman [ 27 ] and Zhang et al. [ 28 ] independently proposed a continuum transport equation for the FSD, extending a similar approach for ice thickness distribution used for describing ice thickness in large-scale sea ice models. The FSD is advected in time and space subject to a prescribed horizontal ice velocity field and a number of sources and sinks that describe the effects of thermodynamics (melting and freezing), lead opening, ridging and fragmentation, noting the latter phenomenon is parametrized in a highly simplified manner (uniformly redistributed floe sizes). Horvat and Tziperman provide the most advanced approach, by considering the joint floe size and thickness distribution and process-informed parametrizations of the source and sink terms, particularly wave-induced floe fracture, which accounts for the strain field generated by a wave spectrum. Also note that Herman [ 20 ] showed that the Pareto distribution used to fit observational FSD data (discussed earlier) emerges as a stable solution to a stochastic model of FSD evolution based on the generalized Lotka\u2013Volterra equation. Here, the three-dimensional phase-resolving scattering model of wave energy attenuation in the MIZ reported by Montiel et al. [ 9 ] is enhanced with a floe break-up model, allowing us to investigate the two-way wave\u2013MIZ coupling in an idealized setting. The MIZ is constructed as an array of circular elastic floes with prescribed FSD and the forcing field is approximated by a monochromatic plane wave. The solution to the wave interaction problem provides a full description of (i) the wave field throughout the MIZ and (ii) the bending experienced by each floe. The latter information is used to derive a measure of elastic deformation in each floe which, if larger than a critical value, results in floe fracture. The post-break-up updated FSD is then fed back into the geometrical description of the MIZ, leading to a new solution of the wave interaction, which is in turn used to approximate ice floe break-up. Running this feedback loop simulation a sufficient number of times, we reach a steady-state FSD, which depends on the ice and wave parameters. The main goals of this investigation are to (i) study the evolution of the FSD towards its steady state under repeated wave break-up events, (ii) determine the effect of multiple scattering on the steady-state FSD, and (iii) examine the dependence of the FSD on the ice and wave parameters of this model. A key novel feature of the flexural failure model proposed here is that it accounts for the two-dimensional stress field defined over the surface of each deformed floe. It is based on the two-dimensional Mohr\u2013Coulomb (MC) stress criterion, which assesses mechanical failure from the combined level of tensile and compressive deformations at each point of the floe. The MC stress criterion has been used to estimate fracture in the elasto-brittle rheological sea ice model neXtSIM under horizontal deformations and wave-induced flexure [ 26 ]. The latter fracture model is a simplified one-dimensional version of the MC criterion used here, as wave-induced ice flexure is approximated using an elastic beam model of ice floe. This is in line with previous flexural failure models [ 22 \u2013 24 , 27 , 29 , 30 ], in which deformation at each point of the beam is simply quantified by the curvature of its vertical displacement function. To our knowledge, the wave-induced break-up model of ice floes considered here is the first one to account for the additional spatial dimension. We do not attempt to compare our model with experimental measurements in this investigation. Ice floe break-up by ocean waves in the MIZ has been reported via either in situ , e.g. [ 13 , 30 \u2013 32 ], or remote-sensing, e.g. [ 12 , 33 , 34 ], observations. These papers describe qualitative or quantitative changes in the FSD after a large wave event breaks up the MIZ. It is unclear, however, which physical processes have contributed to the observed changes in the FSD, as it is not possible to isolate the effect of waves. For this reason, we focus our analysis on gaining a theoretical understanding of how ocean waves may influence sea ice break-up in the MIZ and the associated FSD. 2. Preliminaries We consider a three-dimensional seawater domain with constant finite depth h and infinite horizontal extent. Cartesian coordinates x =( x , y , z ) are used to locate points in the water domain, such that the planes z =0 and z =\u2212 h coincide with the unperturbed free surface and the flat impermeable seabed, respectively. The seawater is approximated as an inviscid and homogeneous incompressible fluid with density \u03c1 0 \u22481025\u2009kg\u2009m \u22123 . A finite array of N f compliant sea ice floes is assumed to be freely floating at the equilibrium surface of the water domain. Each floe is circular with uniform thickness D and Archimedean draught d =( \u03c1 / \u03c1 0 ) D , where \u03c1 \u2248922.5\u2009kg\u2009m \u22123 is the density of sea ice. The radius of floe i is a i and its centre has coordinates in the horizontal plane ( x i , y i ). The horizontal region of seawater covered by a floe is defined by \u03a9", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "horvat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kohout", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dumont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tziperman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montiel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhang", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fsd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "horvat & tziperman", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lotka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "volterra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arctic basin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antarctic miz", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T12:01:15.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e6bb66230b9fd119350b2fe854947e870127465", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmnElK7x7D7_j2U2s745gGrTK2sJhipU0UYFhmPTuiYpJ88ppkZKihi.fiBPVVbn9uq3V1XnHP4J0FbZ_69nu5_M", "site_full": "rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org", "site": "royalsocietypublishing.org", "site_section": "http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/rss/current.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences current issue", "title": "Kinematic dynamos in spheroidal geometries", "title_full": "Kinematic dynamos in spheroidal geometries", "published": "2017-10-04T10:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45018, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e6bb66230b9fd119350b2fe854947e870127465", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmnElK7x7D7_j2U2s745gGrTK2sJhipU0UYFhmPTuiYpJ88ppkZKihi.fiBPVVbn9uq3V1XnHP4J0FbZ_69nu5_M", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ivers, D.

The large-scale evolution of programming languages (1953\u20132012). Lineages of influence form well-defined subgraphs (like procedural languages, shown here). Using network methods, we can reconstruct ( a ) the phylogenetic tree and ( b ) the map of horizontal exchanges. These networks show statistical regularities that can be interpreted from an evolutionary perspective. ( c ) Key innovations (microchip) marked the abrupt increase of the diversity of languages (solid circles) and the influences among them (open circles) and the rise of personal computers (grey area). ( d ) Frequency-rank plot of language popularity can be fitted with discrete generalized beta distribution (DGBD). This distribution is the outcome of a process of technological competition based on increasing returns. In both ( c ) and ( d ), arrows point to popular languages. Phylogenetic networks reveal sudden bursts of language diversification marked by key innovations. For example, a clear transition from top-down designs and restrictive computers to bottom-up development and mass-market products took place around 1982, coinciding with the rise of personal computers. Before this transition, the design of programming languages was constrained by specific needs and hardware limitations. In the 1970s, cheap and efficient microprocessors revolutionized electronics, including rapid advances in programming languages and man\u2013machine interaction. This pattern is consistent with a model of technological recombination and tinkering that does not include selection forces. The network of influences grows by introducing a new language which links to randomly chosen target languages with given probability as well as to a certain fraction of ancestors of each target. Matching this model to historical data predicts structural patterns of influence networks and the two-regime scenario defined by a shift in the number L = | E | of links exchanged by new languages ( figure 5 c ). The paradox is that the rapid growth of programming languages might be declining precisely because the distance between hardware and software is increasing. Hardware became so powerful that the same software can be executed without modification in different environments. High-level languages like C and Java allow source code portability from one machine to another, that is, users are no longer tied to specific hardware but to their software choices, e.g. operating system and programming languages. The rise and fall of programming languages is a process of technological competition based on increasing returns [ 63 ]. Sometimes technological success (or failure) can be explained through a process of increasing returns and with little connection to rational decisions [ 64 ]. The explanation comes from the nature of returns in an economic system where compatibility largely dominates the potential choices made by users and consumers. The more users a technology has, the larger the chances that novel users will adopt it. This process of social amplification leads to competition and necessarily ends in the extinction of the less popular choices. The frequency-rank plot of language popularity follows the discrete generalized beta distribution [ 65 ] 4.1 where r is the programming language rank, N is the maximum rank value, A is a normalization constant and a = 1.44 and b = 0.46 are fitting exponents ( figure 5 d ). Language rankings show an overabundance of rare languages and the presence of a few, widely adopted languages. However, language popularity does not display a two-regime scenario. The continuous distribution covers the entire spectrum of community sizes, from rare to common languages. Such scaling behaviour reveals the presence of amplification phenomena that often can be explained with very simple rules. Similar scaling laws can be found in the distribution of human languages [ 66 ]. We proposed a very simple spatial model of cultural diffusion capable of reproducing the empirical frequency-rank distribution of language popularity [ 63 ]. In the model, languages experience a strong selection process because of a combination of globalization, the finite ecosystem of language users and the rapid spread of innovations due to social learning and imitation. Users adopt languages that are not difficult to learn and they are shared by many users (the more, the better). Because increasing returns play a key role here and homogenization is growing with globalization, programming languages are destined to be less and less diverse. 5. Software bottleneck In studies of technological innovation, it is often assumed that invention is the product of solitary geniuses or small groups of innovators. The role of collectives is secondary here, merely acting as social amplifiers of successful inventions, that is, the innovations. Competition-based models of technological diffusion explain the rapid adoption of the new over old across user populations [ 22 ]. Much less is understood about the role played by groups and collectives in the origin of technological innovations. Antagonistic interactions prevent the growth of complex projects, which depends not only on sharing and cooperative behaviour, but also on specific technological traits. The \u2018cumulative culture\u2019 hypothesis [ 67 , 68 ] proposes that larger groups produce complex systems more often than do smaller groups. This model assumes that social learning is highly selective, i.e. the most skilled individuals will be responsible for advancing cultural complexity over the generations and many individuals will learn from them [ 69 ]. When people copy the most skilled individual, the rate of cultural accumulation is strongly correlated with population size. In this case, there is a critical population size that sustains the progressive accumulation of skills and knowledge over time. An increasing population size might explain the sudden shifts in cultural prehistory [ 70 ]. On the other hand, when population drops below this minimum threshold, there is a noticeable risk of technological collapse (as Henrich [ 67 ] argued for prehistoric Tasmania). The assumptions of this model appear to be quite apt for describing computer programming. Software development belongs to the category of \u2018tools that are hard to learn to make and easy to screw up\u2019 [ 71 , p. 776]. The difficulty of the task is so high that many practitioners conclude that \u2018excellent developers, like excellent musicians and artists, are born, not made\u2019 [ 72 , p. 218]. Empirical observations suggest that software growth is sustainable only when their programmers are sufficiently skilled and there is a large enough number of them, otherwise there is a noticeable risk of project collapse [ 73 ]. For example, usage frequency of open-source software in communities of practice appears to be correlated with the rate of project success. Population bottlenecks limit the spreading of technological innovations [ 74 \u2013 76 ], that is, software projects with small teams can create new functions but they fail because of the lack of error detection and repair capabilities. A minimal model of technological diffusion comprises a population of N individuals (firms, users and programmers), each having a technological level z i (a measure of accumulated knowledge or skill level, e.g. software size or diversity of functions) with i = [1, N ]. Let us define as the mean technological level of the population. At every generation, each \u2018newborn\u2019 (or newcomer) in the population tries to copy the most skilled individual. This is a conservative assumption regarding the loss of information with decreasing population size [ 69 ]. Using the Price equation [ 77 ], it can be shown [ 67 ] that the rate of innovation is proportional to the population size. Also, innovation decreases with mean cultural level because more complex knowledge becomes increasingly difficult to acquire [ 78 ] 5.1 where \u03b3 > 0 is the cultural transmission error and \u03b4 > 0 is the random inference parameter. Note that technology accumulates (d z /d t > 0) under low transmission errors, high random inference and large population sizes. The population grows according to the logistic model [ 74 ] 5.2 where r > 0 is a small reproduction rate. The carrying capacity M ( z ) is a step function with an inflection point at z c , i.e. M ( z ) = K + D when z > z c and M ( z ) = k otherwise. The parameter K sets the carrying capacity in the absence of culture ( z \u2192 0) and carrying capacity saturates at K + D when cultural complexity is very large ( z \u2192 \u221e). It is easy to check that the previous system allows for multi-stability. By letting d z /d t = 0, we obtain one stable point at N * = z / \u03b4 while d N /d t = 0 gives two stable alternative states under the following condition 5.3 We suppose that cultural changes take place much more rapidly than demographics, that is 5.4 and thus . By substituting Z \u2248 \u03b4N / \u03b3 in (5.2) and assuming a separation of scales between N and Z , we obtain 5.5 which gives a unidimensional system. Now, we would like to compute the potential function, i.e. \u03a6 r ( N ) defined as 5.6 where \u03a6 r ( N ) is the integral 5.7 and 5.8 However, we cannot calculate the integral (5.7) because the function M ( z ) is not continuous. We choose to replace M ( z ) with a sigmoidal curve 5.9 Moreover, the above curve can be further approximated (by Taylor expansion) in the vicinity of z c : 5.10 Using the above approximations, we obtain an expression for the potential function (5.6) that can be solved: 5.11 where and \u03b1 = \u03b2\u03b4 / \u03b3 . For (5.11), we have two alternative stable states corresponding to low population, low cultural level and high population, high cultural level, whereas the middle equilibrium state is unstable. This system allows for bi-stability and transitions between the two stable states that can take place when we perform a large perturbation to population size. This model of cumulative cultural innovation describes a mechanism for rapid technological change [ 76 ]. This might be a general feature of other cultural and social-technical systems 3 (discussed in later sections). Although the model is very simple, it provides interesting insights into the evolution of software projects. First, the model predicts a transition between two different kinds of growth dynamics depending on the quality of programmers, e.g. high rates of error detections and low rate of random errors in (5.1). Fast project growth is possible when programming quality is high enough to detect and fix software errors. Otherwise, the number of errors keeps growing and the project slows down because of the sudden drop in software reliability. Second, the design matrix model discussed in \u00a73 suggests that network simplification accelerates growth, which seems to contradict the group-size hypothesis, i.e. larger populations (and thus higher levels of complexity) are responsible for accelerated rates of innovation. Programmers combine several mechanisms in the same project to maintain long-term integrity. Software growth is affected not only by design complexity and programmer quality but also by population size. Software development is an instance of a complex optimization problem under multiple constraints [ 54 ]. For example, programming teams, or population size in equation (5.2), do not grow beyond the upper bound defined by coordination costs [ 24 ]. Finally, cumulative culture theory has been criticized because writing, printing and other forms of information transmission preserve cultural information outside humans and it \u2018is unknown whether the maintenance of current cultural complexity is nowadays similarly dependent on group size\u2019 [ 68 , p. 391]. Interestingly, it is generally accepted that the cost of software maintenance is larger than the cost of new developments [ 80 ]. In this context, open-source projects can learn from their mistakes through user collaboration and \u2018cumulative maintenance\u2019. 6. The information technology evolution space Our goal in this paper has been to show the potential of cultural evolution when understanding the emergence of transitions in IT. Hardware and software metaphors abound in studies of biological systems but there are very few evolutionary models of IT. The evolution of IT is a very rich and complex history that involves several types of actors, artefacts, organizations and different timescales and mechanisms (tinkering, optimization, social learning and complexity). Three dimensions, i.e. software, hardware and diffusion, summarize the design space of computer systems ( figure 6 ). This space defines a taxonomy that helps us understand where a proposed system stands with respect to other designs. Two dimensions (performance and popularity) define a continuous spectrum of possibilities, and the third (openness) is more qualitative. For the purposes of our study, the major transitions of IT are located at different thresholds of these axes, which divide the space into phases or groups of distinct designs.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T16:29:30.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee279322a7642247bdd67ff4b4f2eed0840f3ceb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrml.0mjAXxuscRYbdT4PLBsoL2vY1m8dRuzqzRxhfeKC2A--", "site_full": "rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org", "site": "royalsocietypublishing.org", "site_section": "http://highwire.stanford.edu/rss/journalsbydate.xml", "site_categories": ["science", "biology"], "section_title": "HighWire-hosted journals, sorted by date of last publication", "title": "Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "title_full": "Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "published": "2017-10-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45018, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee279322a7642247bdd67ff4b4f2eed0840f3ceb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrml.0mjAXxuscRYbdT4PLBsoL2vY1m8dRuzqzRxhfeKC2A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "text": "Dennis J.

Krieger , Alex McAvoy , Martin A. Nowak Published 4 October 2017 . DOI: 10.1098/rsif.2017.0509 Madison S. Krieger PDF Abstract In evolutionary processes, population structure has a substantial effect on natural selection. Here, we analyse how motion of individuals affects constant selection in structured populations. Motion is relevant because it leads to changes in the distribution of types as mutations march towards fixation or extinction. We describe motion as the swapping of individuals on graphs, and more generally as the shuffling of individuals between reproductive updates. Beginning with a one-dimensional graph, the cycle, we prove that motion suppresses natural selection for death\u2013birth (DB) updating or for any process that combines birth\u2013death (BD) and DB updating. If the rule is purely BD updating, no change in fixation probability appears in the presence of motion. We further investigate how motion affects evolution on the square lattice and weighted graphs. In the case of weighted graphs, we find that motion can be either an amplifier or a suppressor of natural selection. In some cases, whether it is one or the other can be a function of the relative reproductive rate, indicating that motion is a subtle and complex attribute of evolving populations. As a first step towards understanding less restricted types of motion in evolutionary graph theory, we consider a similar rule on dynamic graphs induced by a spatial flow and find qualitatively similar results, indicating that continuous motion also suppresses natural selection.

However, the methodological advancements in this field have been mostly and sometimes exclusively used only in indoor laboratory settings. In parallel, there has been an unprecedented and rapid improvement in our ability to track animals and their behaviour in the wild. However, while the spatial analysis of tracking data is widespread, its temporal aspect is largely unexplored. Here, we review the tools that are available or have potential to record rhythms in the wild animals with emphasis on currently overlooked approaches and monitoring systems. We then demonstrate, in three question-driven case studies, how the integration of traditional and newer approaches can help answer novel chronobiological questions in free-living animals.

The fitness outcome of such activities depends largely on their interspecific interactions; the temporal overlap with other species determines when they should be active in order to maximize their encounters with food and to minimize their encounters with predators, competitors and parasites. To cope with the constantly changing, but predictable structure of the environment, organisms have evolved internal biological clocks, which are synchronized mainly by light, the most predictable and reliable environmental cue (but which can be masked by other variables), which enable them to anticipate and prepare for predicted changes in the timing of the species they interact with, on top of responding to them directly. Here, we review examples where the internal timing system is used to predict interspecific interactions, and how these interactions affect the internal timing system and activity patterns. We then ask how plastic these mechanisms are, how this plasticity differs between and within species and how this variability in plasticity affects interspecific interactions in a changing world, in which light, the major synchronizer of the biological clock, is no longer a reliable cue owing to the rapidly changing climate, the use of artificial light and urbanization.

The nature of sexually selected traits such as vocalization, colour and ornamentation, their fitness benefits as well as their costs have received ample attention in field and laboratory studies. However, sexually selected traits may not always be expressed: coloration and ornaments often follow a seasonal pattern and behaviours may be displayed only at specific times of the day. Despite the widely recognized differences in the daily and seasonal timing of traits and their consequences for reproductive success, the actions of sexual selection on the temporal organization of traits has received only scant attention. Drawing on selected examples from bird and mammal studies, here we summarize the current evidence for the daily and seasonal timing of traits. We highlight that molecular advances in chronobiology have opened exciting new opportunities for identifying the genetic targets that sexual selection may act on to shape the timing of trait expression. Furthermore, known genetic links between daily and seasonal timing mechanisms lead to the hypothesis that selection on one timescale may simultaneously also affect the other. We emphasize that studies on the timing of sexual displays of both males and females from wild populations will be invaluable for understanding the nature of sexual selection and its potential to act on differences within and between the sexes in timing. Molecular approaches will be important for pinpointing genetic components of biological rhythms that are targeted by sexual selection, and to clarify whether these represent core or peripheral components of endogenous clocks. Finally, we call for a renewed integration of the fields of evolution, behavioural ecology and chronobiology to tackle the exciting question of how sexual selection contributes to the evolution of biological clocks.

A distinction is made between \u2018capital\u2019 breeders, which finance reproduction using stored energy, and \u2018income\u2019 breeders, which pay for reproduction using concurrent energy intake. In reality, vertebrates use a continuum of capital-to-income tactics, and, for many species, the allocation of capital towards reproduction is a plastic trait. Here, we review how trophic interactions and the timing of life-history events are influenced by tactics of resource use in birds and mammals. We first examine how plasticity in the allocation of capital towards reproduction is linked to phenological flexibility via interactions between endocrine/neuroendocrine control systems and the sensory circuits that detect changes in endogenous state, and environmental cues. We then describe the ecological drivers of reproductive timing in species that vary in the degree to which they finance reproduction using capital. Capital can be used either as a mechanism to facilitate temporal synchrony between energy supply and demand or as a means of lessening the need for synchrony. Within many species, an individual's ability to cope with environmental change may be more tightly linked to plasticity in resource allocation than to absolute position on the capital-to-income breeder continuum.

As with any biological process, the functions of sleep can only be fully understood when examined in the ecological context in which they evolved. Owing to technological constraints, until recently, sleep has primarily been examined in the artificial laboratory environment. However, new tools are enabling researchers to study sleep behaviour and neurophysiology in the wild. Here, we summarize the various methods that have enabled sleep researchers to go wild, their strengths and weaknesses, and the discoveries resulting from these first steps outside the laboratory. The initial studies to \u2018go wild\u2019 have revealed a wealth of interindividual variation in sleep, and shown that sleep duration is not even fixed within an individual, but instead varies in response to an assortment of ecological demands. Determining the costs and benefits of this inter- and intraindividual variation in sleep may reveal clues to the functions of sleep. Perhaps the greatest surprise from these initial studies is that the reduction in neurobehavioural performance resulting from sleep loss demonstrated in the laboratory is not an obligatory outcome of reduced sleep in the wild.

Timely migration requires diverse strategies and adaptations that involve an intricate interplay between internal clock mechanisms and environmental conditions across the annual cycle. Here we review what challenges birds face during long migrations to keep track of time as they exploit geographically distant resources that may vary in availability and predictability, and summarize the clock mechanisms that enable them to succeed. We examine the following challenges: departing in time for spring and autumn migration, in anticipation of future environmental conditions; using clocks on the move, for example for orientation, navigation and stopover; strategies of adhering to, or adjusting, the time programme while fitting their activities into an annual cycle; and keeping pace with a world of rapidly changing environments. We then elaborate these themes by case studies representing long-distance migrating birds with different annual movement patterns and associated adaptations of their circannual programmes. We discuss the current knowledge on how endogenous migration programmes interact with external information across the annual cycle, how components of annual cycle programmes encode topography and range expansions, and how fitness may be affected when mismatches between timing and environmental conditions occur. Lastly, we outline open questions and propose future research directions.

Examples of lunar-related rhythms of invertebrates. ( a ) Eurydice adult with chromatophores (black dots on the dorsal surface of cuticle) and swimming activity of a single individual over 9 days in constant darkness). The animal was taken during a spring tide from Bangor, Wales, UK and placed immediately in constant darkness (DD). The approximate natural light (grey)/dark (black) cycle on the day the animal was harvested is shown as a bar above the actogram and each day's activity is double plotted on a horizontal 48 h scale so that so that each row represents two consecutive days. Note that the movement to the right on every successive day reveals a tidal period longer than 12 h and the night-time activity is greater than that of the daytime (diurnal inequality). Adapted from [30]. ( b ) Mangrove cricket and an actogram for single individual placed in 12 L: 12 D for 8 days then allowed to free run in DD, during which there is more intense activity in the dark phase compared with the light phase (see the histogram) which drifts towards the right reflecting the predominantly 24.8\u201325.5 h rhythm which is about twice the tidal period of approximately 12.4 h. The histogram shows the night-time burst of activity (filled columns) being greater than the daytime burst (unfilled columns) for a few cycles but as this is modulated by the circadian clock, it drifts out of phase with the tidal cycle; so after many cycles, the daytime tidal episode is greater than the night-time (adapted from [ 33 ]). The cricket image is taken from http://mangrove.nus.edu.sg/guidebooks/text/2010.htm .

(a) Circadian and circatidal rhythms in a marine isopod and a mangrove cricket Eurydice pulchra is a marine isopod that lives in the intertidal zone around northern European coasts ( figure 4 a ). As the tide comes in, Eurydice swims out of its sandy burrow and forages. As the tide goes out, Eurydice buries itself back into the sand so it is not dragged out to sea [ 33 , 36 ]. In constant darkness, Eurydice exhibits an endogenous circatidal swimming rhythm of 12.4 h ( figure 4 a ) which can be reset by vibration stimuli, and is temperature compensated, thereby showing all the hallmarks of a true clock [ 36 ]. Interestingly the swimming pattern usually shows the diurnal inequality phenomenon at temperate latitudes ( figure 1 b ), so nocturnal high-tide swimming is considerable greater than daytime swimming ( figure 4 a ). This modulation in swimming is regulated by the circadian clock because under bright light it is disrupted, whereas the tidal 12.4 h swimming period is unaffected, suggesting an independence of circadian and tidal oscillators [ 36 ]. Moreover, Eurydice is called the \u2018speckled sea louse\u2019 because it carries pigmented spots, chromatophores that expand during the day and contract at night ( figure 4 a ) [ 33 , 36 ]. This 24 h cycle is likely regulated by a circadian clock because the 24 h cycle persists under constant darkness, can be reset by light and is disrupted by constant bright light [ 33 , 36 ]). Indeed, knockdown of Eurydice 's period gene, whose Drosophila orthologue plays a central role in the molecular clock machinery of Drosophila melanogaster , has a similar effect to constant light, with circadian cycles in chromatophore dispersion and in Eurydice timeless mRNA disrupted. Yet the very same canonical clock gene misregulation has little effect on the circatidal swimming periodicity of 12.4 h [ 36 ]. Although these results invoke separate circatidal and circadian oscillators, pharmacological inhibitors of Eurydice \u2019s casein kinase 1\u025b (CK1\u025b), which phosphorylates PER protein in D. melanogaster and hence could also inhibit similar post-translational modification of Eurydice 's PER protein, lengthened both tidal swimming and the circadian chromatophore cycle [ 36 ]. This might suggest that the two oscillators share a common pathway. However CK1\u025b has many targets, so the inhibitor might render CK1\u025b less able to phosphorylate a tidally relevant protein that we have yet to identify. It is unlikely that any effect of the inhibitor on Eurydice \u2019s PER protein phosphorylation is mediating tidal lengthening because direct disruption of Eurydice \u2019s period gene mRNA through RNA interference had no effect on this phenotype [ 36 ]. The circadian day\u2013night modulation of the tidal swimming rhythms in Eurydice is also observed in the locomotor activity of the mangrove cricket [ 37 ] ( figure 4 b ). However, the periodicity of the cricket's locomotor activity pattern is circatidal and approximately 12.4 h. Elegant genetic studies have used RNAi-mediated knockdown of the canonical clock genes in this species, period and Clock (in insects and mammals CLOCK protein is one of a pair of molecules that activate period and timeless gene transcription). The knock-down left 12.4 h tidal rhythms intact, but disrupted the circadian modulation of alternate bouts of locomotor activity [ 38 , 39 ]. As in Eurydice , these gene knockdowns suggest that the two molecular oscillators underlying circadian and tidal rhythms are largely independent of each other. Moreover, surgical ablation of the optic lobes (likely location of the circadian oscillator) disrupted the circadian locomotor pattern, but as with the gene knockdown, the tidal rhythm remained intact [ 34 ]). Consequently, molecular mechanisms of the two oscillators not only may be independent, but also may reside in different groups of neurons. (b) Circadian and semi-lunar emergence of the marine midge Perhaps the best-known example of a moon-related phenotype in insects is the semi-lunar emergence rhythms in the marine midge, C. marinus ( figure 4 c ) , first studied by Neumann and collaborators 50 years ago (e.g. [ 40 ]). During full and new moon, millions of males and females of the midge emerge from the sea as low tide exposes the habitats where they have developed from eggs to pupae ( figure 4 c ). These adults mate and live for a few hours, so it is critical that they emerge synchronously during those few hours of low tide. The timing of the lowest tide can be predicted from the lunar calendar, but these critical few hours during the day vary from location to location [ 40 ]). Thus, the emergence of the marine midge has to rely on two clocks, one circa-semi-lunar or circalunar, and the other circadian. A recent and spectacular molecular genetic study used populations of midges living in different European locations ( figure 4 c ), in combination with the fully referenced draft genome of the midge generated de novo [ 7 ], to identify the genetic bases of semi-lunar or lunar and circadian rhythms. First, the local circadian adaptations mapped to the gene encoding calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II.1 ( CaMKII ) [ 7 ]. Importantly, mutations in the homologous gene can disrupt circadian timing in the mouse [ 41 ] and D. melanogaster [ 35 , 42 ]. Secondly and more importantly for lunar-related phenotypes, the genetic mapping experiment localized a chromosomal region responsible for the population differences in semi-lunar versus lunar emergence timing [ 7 ]. Lack of canonical clock circadian genes mapping to this region implies that a novel timing gene (or genes) contributes to the lunar phenotype. (c) Circadian activity and lunar reproductive cycles of the bristle worm Finally, the bristle worm P. dumerilii ( figure 4 d ) spawns in a monthly rhythm, in which the number of worms that are sexually mature peaks around the time of new moon and troughs at full moon ( figure 4 d ) [ 43 , 44 ]. This monthly rhythm appears to be driven by exposure to moonlight during full moon because the monthly cycle of reproductive maturity can be entrained in the laboratory by nocturnal dim light lasting for eight consecutive nights during the month ( figure 4 d ). Also, the monthly maturity rhythm will free-run for several months under constant darkness, but not under constant light or in constant darkness without previous moonlight exposure, suggesting a true circalunar cycle [ 43 ]. In addition, the worms show circadian locomotor rhythms particularly in light\u2013dark cycles. The strength of this rhythm is modulated by the phases of the moon, suggesting a crosstalk between the two oscillators [ 43 ]. When the worms were treated with the same CK1\u025b/\u03b4 kinase inhibitor used in Eurydice , circadian locomotor behaviour and circadian gene expression of canonical clock genes were severely disrupted, but the circalunar maturity rhythm was essentially unaffected. The authors' conclusions resonated with those from Eurydice and the mangrove cricket, in that the circadian oscillators appeared to be molecularly independent from the circalunar clocks [ 43 ]. The only possible inconsistency between the discussed studies concerns tidal and lunar periodicity. The CK1\u025b inhibitor influenced the tidal periodicity in Eurydice , but not the lunar cycle in bristle worm. Likely, there are important differences in the mechanisms that generate 12.4 h tidal and 29 day lunar rhythms even though they are clearly geophysically and astronomically related. However, the maturity rhythm of the bristle worm was monitored only for two months after the inhibition. Thus, a period difference between the inhibited and control animals might have gone undetected. It would require several more months of expensive drug exposure and several cycles of monitoring of the maturity rhythm to state definitively that there was no effect on the period of the free-running maturation cycle. The above examples used molecular manipulations in vivo allied to the analysis of behavioural and molecular phenotypes in non-model invertebrates. Such analyses are much more difficult to perform compared with model organisms like D. melanogaster or the mouse but they have led to an understanding of what does NOT constitute the tidal oscillator. From three independent studies in Eurydice, mangrove crickets and the bristle worm, the consensus of opinion suggests that lunar-related rhythms may not be generated by the canonical circadian clock genes. Some caution should still be reserved in accepting this conclusion, particularly concerning the CK1\u03b5 inhibitor, which dramatically affects the period of Eurydice \u2019s tidal swimming. In addition, if the tidal oscillator in the mangrove cricket is more robust than the circadian oscillator that modulates its tidal locomotor episodes, then RNAi-mediated knockdown may not knock-down period or Clock genes far enough to affect the tidal oscillator. Unfortunately, both organisms are difficult to rear in the laboratory so the use of gene editing tools to create null-mutants is unlikely in the near future. 4. General conclusion and outlook We have documented the crosstalk between the tidal and circadian rhythms in the distance that a red knot moved from its roost during foraging ( figure 3 ). This is reminiscent of the circadian modulation of tidal behaviour observed in both Eurydice and the mangrove cricket. Thus, we suspect that in all these organisms the brain centres dedicated to expressing tidal and circadian phenotypes will be anatomically connected and, therefore, signalling reciprocally to each other. The next challenge is to find which genes encode tidal/lunar time in the above-described invertebrates. Once invertebrate lunar/tidal genes are identified, homology should allow the isolation of similar genes in vertebrates like red knots. We might predict that the tidal genes that generate the approximately 12.4 h behavioural cycles might also encode cycling mRNAs by analogy with their circadian counterparts. Might these (as yet unidentified) putatively 12 h tidally cycling mRNAs show among-individual fluctuations to account for the variation in tidal rhythms observed in red knots? Could these mRNAs still be cycling in the biparental incubating species but their output is suppressed? Would any future identification of a tidally cycling mRNA in a tidal vertebrate suggest a co-option of a previously 12 h cycling mRNA in a terrestrial circadian species [ 45 , 46 ] that was re-used to generate tidal phenotypes when the species moved to an intertidal environment? Whatever the identity of these tidal or lunar genes, the conservation of circadian genes in invertebrates and vertebrates might suggest that the same will be true also for tidal and lunar genes [ 47 ]. Tidal genes will initially be identified in invertebrates, but homology with vertebrate genes will be expected to open up interesting possibilities for mechanistic studies of the clock in intertidal birds. For example, using in situ hybridization will identify the brain regions that have tidally cycling molecules and comparing these regions with those areas that show circadian cycling molecules will detect both oscillators. In addition, we must not forget the obvious, that behavioural ecology scenarios are far more complex than those we play out in the confines of the laboratory. As we have learned with shorebirds, individuals vary in their foraging rhythms, and behavioural rhythms during incubation are very loosely coupled to the major environmental cycles [ 14 ]. Consequently, the modulation of molecular rhythms by other selection pressures will provide a novel background against which to study biological rhythmicity within an ecologically realistic framework. Indeed, when rodents or flies are placed in semi-natural environments and their circadian rhythms monitored, quite startling results can be observed that could not have been predicted from laboratory studies and which question some of the assumptions made about the adaptive value of the circadian clock [ 48 \u2013 50 , but see also 51 ]. As with the incubation study of biparental shorebirds [ 14 ], when realistic scenarios are used to study biological rhythms, the results do not meet expectations. We, therefore, encourage behavioural ecologists and chronobiologists to seek collaborations, particularly as the long-term spatial and temporal monitoring of individuals in the field becomes feasible [ 52 ] and the new post-genomic age allows molecular study of organisms other than laboratory flies or mice. We anticipate that a fertile hybrid area of research will evolve, perhaps slowly at first, but with a real potential to significantly illuminate our understanding of the functional and adaptive roles of biological rhythms.

The timing information contained within the environment serves as critical timing cues for the internal biological timing system, but how this system drives daily rhythms in behaviour and physiology may also depend on the internal state of the animal. The disparity between timing of these cues in natural and laboratory conditions can result in substantial differences in the scheduling of behaviour and physiology under these conditions. In nature, temporal coordination of biological processes is critical to maximize fitness because they optimize the balance between reproduction, foraging and predation risk. Here we focus on the role of peripheral circadian clocks, and the rhythms that they drive, in enabling adaptive phenotypes. We discuss how reproduction, endocrine activity and metabolism interact with peripheral clocks, and outline the complex phenotypes arising from changes in this system. We conclude that peripheral timing is critical to adaptive plasticity of circadian organization in the field, and that we must abandon standard laboratory conditions to understand the mechanisms that underlie this plasticity which maximizes fitness under natural conditions.

Although these interactions have received much attention in both ecology and evolution, their temporal aspects are little explored. Here we review studies on the circadian organization of pollination-related traits in bees and flowers. Research, mostly with the honeybee, Apis mellifera , has implicated the circadian clock in key aspects of their foraging for flower rewards. These include anticipation, timing of visits to flowers at specified locations and time-compensated sun-compass orientation. Floral rhythms in traits such as petal opening, scent release and reward availability also show robust daily rhythms. However, in only few studies was it possible to adequately determine whether these oscillations are driven by external time givers such as light and temperature cycles, or endogenous circadian clocks. The interplay between the timing of flower and pollinator rhythms may be ecologically significant. Circadian regulation of pollination-related traits in only few species may influence the entire pollination network and thus affect community structure and local biodiversity.

Flexibility of the photoperiodic response is critical for rapid shifts to new hosts, survival in the face of global climate change and to reproductive isolation. At the same time, the daily circadian clock is also essential for development, diapause and multiple behaviours, including correct flight orientation during long-distance migration. Although studied for decades, how these two critical biological timing mechanisms are integrated is poorly understood, in part because the core circadian clock genes are all transcription factors or regulators that are able to exert multiple effects throughout the genome. In this chapter, we discuss clocks in the wild from the perspective of diverse insect groups across eco-geographic contexts from the Antarctic to the tropical regions of Earth. Application of the expanding tool box of molecular techniques will lead us to distinguish universal from unique mechanisms underlying the evolution of circadian and photoperiodic timing, and their interaction across taxonomic and ecological contexts represented by insects.

NP, natural period. To some extent, over the next decades the research programmes of the two fields became non-overlapping, with chronobiologists focusing on unravelling the endogenous clock machinery and ecologists addressing the functional significance of timing in nature. Both by necessity and design, mechanistic work mostly has been conducted using a limited number of model organisms, each living in isolation, housed under standard (and, except for the rhythmic alternation of light and darkness, unchanging) conditions, with food ad libitum. Clearly, a successful life in the laboratory does not translate to survival in the wild. For chronobiologists to understand the significance, function and evolution of endogenous clocks, they must turn to richer natural environment(s), where abiotic and biotic factors impose significant adaptive challenges that are integral to a species' ecological niche. Conversely, ecologists often have not considered the profound innate temporal programming that organisms undergo, including rhythmic changes in gene expression and physiological capacity, that regulates their responses to diverse perturbations. This persistent dichotomy has even led some authors to lament that there is an \u2018\u2026 almost insurmountable gap between [the two groups], who seldom, if ever, are aware of each other\u2019 [ 5 ]. The time is now ripe to reinvigorate a truly synthetic approach. We now have at hand: tools to record, analyse and even manipulate gears of the endogenous oscillatory machinery; identified markers of the multimodal outputs of brain and body clocks; and new and powerful devices and analytics for tracking animals and their physiological indices in the wild, both over space and time. This issue, inspired by a meeting of chronobiologists and ecologists at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research on the island of Texel in The Netherlands (\u2018Wild Clocks: Ecology Meets Chronobiology\u2019, 15\u201320 March 2015) seeks to catalyse such a reunification, highlighting new advances and approaches that can address the interdependence of chronobiology and ecology. In the following 11 papers, we assess where the intertwined fields stand in connecting functional and causal principles, in an evolutionary perspective. The first article lays a foundation by assessing the concepts and assumptions with which ecological and chronobiological researchers approach biological timekeeping. The main finding is that the two fields share a deep interest in consistent temporal phenotypes (chronotypes) and in phenotypic plasticity of timekeeping, which offer a basis for future integration [ 6 ]. Subsequently, two articles highlight the exciting new tools that now provide major advances in both fields. The first gives an overview and several case studies of new technologies for field research on timing in wild animals [ 7 ]. The second details the power of new technology for research on sleep. Because physiological methods can now be taken afield, exciting new answers to old questions about the function and evolution of sleep may be within reach [ 8 ]. With new tools and a better understanding of clocks, differences in findings from studies in the field and the laboratory can now be approached as indicators of flexibility of biological timekeeping. The next article examines such differences and their mechanistic basis. It highlights how peripheral tissue clocks, for example, relating to endocrine, metabolic and reproductive processes, contribute to the flexibility that is required of functional timekeeping in natural environments [ 9 ]. The three following contributions apply the strengths of integrated chronobiological and ecological approaches to key topics of seasonal biology. These include resource use in mammalian and avian reproduction, annual alternation between rest and active phases of insects, and seasonal migration of birds. The three articles identify timing programmes and their roles, respectively, in the capital\u2013income breeder spectrum [ 10 ], in timely activation from diapause and other insect lifecycle stages [ 11 ] and in enabling migratory species to exploit geographically distant resource pulses [ 12 ]. These reviews are followed by an in-depth look at intra-specific variation in timing from an evolutionary standpoint. Selection in the wild for biological clocks is poorly understood, and even less so are possible contributions of sexual selection, which the article takes as its focal point [ 13 ]. The final three contributions examine interspecific dimensions of biological timekeeping. The stage is set by an overview article which emphasizes that fitness implications of biological clocks depend on species interactions, e.g. in contexts of food availability, predation or parasitism [ 14 ]. Then, the importance of such interactions is highlighted based on an exemplary system, the finely timed coevolution between flowering plants and their pollinators, which ultimately affects species interactions up to community levels [ 15 ]. Interspecific interactions reach their possibly highest temporal complexity in marine environments, which in addition to daily and annual rhythms are also subject to substantial fluctuations at tidal and lunar time scales. The closing article in this collection reviews knowledge of the temporal multi-tasking that is required in these environments, and the burgeoning insights into how several simultaneous clocks tick alongside each other in a single organism [ 16 ]. A new chronobiological/ecological rapprochement is not only exciting but particularly urgent, given evidence for the increasing levels of light at night and progressive climate change, raising critical questions about disruptive effects on biological timekeeping. The resulting shifts in ecological balance, still incompletely understood, could eventually lead to reduced biodiversity and ecosystem instability [ 17 , 18 ]. The search for answers, including some that will come from the construction and curation of large temporal datasets partly collected and analysed through citizen science approaches, demands an integrated causal and functional approach.

Glossary: definitions of key terms Abiotic time All aspects of geophysical cycles and their climatic correlates, including the duration and intensity of light exposure, cycles in temperature, humidity, precipitation and gravitation (note that effects of some of these factors can be modified by an organism's own behaviour, e.g. hiding underground). Amplitude Difference between the maximum or minimum value of a behavioural or physiological rhythm and its mean (level). Biotic time All aspects of the living environment that affect an organism's specific biological or physiological rhythm, including the influences of conspecifics (social interactions), competitors, parasites, predators and prey. Chronotype Characterization of consistent timing (phase) of an individual's entrained behavioural or physiological rhythm. It relates phase markers of a rhythm of choice (e.g. activity), or the composite of an individual's rhythms, to an external phase-reference (e.g. midday) and to other individuals measured under similar conditions (e.g. early versus late types). An example is wake-time relative to sunrise. Effector systems The organ systems (e.g. muscles or exocrine glands) of the animal body which mediate the influence of the central nervous system on overt behaviour such as movement or secretion. Endogenous rhythm A rhythm capable of self-sustained oscillations, generated by living organisms without need for external rhythmic input (i.e. periodic repetitions are generated under constant environmental conditions). Entrainment The process of synchronization of the clock's oscillation to the Zeitgeber (usually the environmental day\u2013night cycle) by resetting clock speed and/or phase. External time The time measured conventionally as clock time at a given location, measured from midnight (=0) until midnight the following day [ 19 ]. Free-running rhythm The endogenous rhythm exhibited under constant conditions, characterized by its period length and amplitude. Internal clock time Internal representation of time, given by the phase of endogenous rhythms (e.g. reproductive state; subjective midnight), and can determine an organism's response to an environmental factor [ 19 , 20 ]. Masking An effect by an environmental factor that directly modifies the expression of an overt rhythm; masking may augment (positive masking) or suppress (negative masking) the amplitude of a rhythm or alter its measured phase. Oscillator A system capable of producing a regular, periodic fluctuation of an output around a mean. Period length Time after which a defined phase of the rhythm re-occurs; i.e. time taken for a full cycle. Phase A defined, stable cycle-to-cycle reference point within the cycle of a rhythm (e.g. start of activity). Phase angle of entrainment The time difference (phase relationship) between a defined phase of a behavioural or physiological rhythm (e.g. start of activity) and an external phase reference (e.g. time of sunrise). Phenotypic plasticity The property of a genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to different environmental conditions. Reaction norm A function that describes the phenotypic response of a given genotype to variations in factors of the environment. Zeitgeber (time-giver; \u2018entraining cue\u2019) A periodic external signal capable of entraining a biological rhythm; in circadian context light is the predominant zeitgeber. Zeitgebers do not induce a rhythm but determine its period length and set its phase angle. Terminology of biological rhythm. The graph shows a schematic circadian rhythm (e.g., in body temperature). On the left-hand side, it is entrained to the light\u2013dark cycle, on the right-hand side, it is free-running under constant light. The graph highlights defined phase points (here, peaks; indicated by circles), period length as the time taken for a full cycle between two phase points, and amplitude and level of the rhythm; it also shows phase angle (potentially chronotype) as the difference between an external phase-reference (here, lights on) and the phase point.

Introduction This paper examines three female writers who chose to affiliate their educational scientific works with the \u2018domestic sphere\u2019: Priscilla Wakefield, Jane Marcet and Maria Edgeworth. It shows that within what is now broadly categorized as \u2018familiar science\u2019, differing motivations for writing, publishing and reading existed. Between 1790 and 1830 many educationalists claimed that the best way for children to learn was for them to exercise their memory on things encountered in everyday life. Religious allegiances, attitudes towards female science education and the utility of science in the home help to explain why these writers chose to introduce their readers to the illimitable world of science by setting their books in the seemingly restrictive domestic sphere. Furthermore, this paper argues that three different authors envisioned subtly different domestic spheres as settings for their work. Rather than there being a single homogeneous domestic sphere in which women and children received their education, and about which such authors wrote, there existed a multiplicity of domestic spheres depicted across the genre of educational science texts. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries middle-class British women may well have been encouraged to retire to the private sphere and to domestic life, 1 but that withdrawal from the public sphere did not leave women bereft of scientific knowledge or purpose. A mother's education, including scientific education, of her children was integral to good domestic management in those many middle-class homes which accepted the advantages of teaching at home rather than in an institution. 2 Writers also recommended education on scientific topics as a way of enhancing women's abilities in the domestic sphere. Mary Wollstonecraft argued that middle- and upper-class young women should replace the novels, music, poetry and gallantry that made them slaves to their senses and, instead, exercise more properly their understanding, pursue fine literature, gardening\u2014and experimental philosophy. 3 Female writers, assuming the mantle of mother or governess, portrayed scientific activities as an extension of \u2018womanly duties\u2019. 4 Thus, the domestic sphere was a site for the diffusion of scientific knowledge; 5 it was a space where everyday household objects and chores could be transformed into scientific lessons for children and adults alike. 6 One way in which these opportunities and practices within the domestic sphere were reflected in science writing was through what Melanie Keene has called \u2018familiar science\u2019. In the early nineteenth century, publishers were beginning to recognize that new commercial opportunities lay in the production of science texts aimed at the \u2018information-hungry\u2019 middle classes. Scientific works for general readers were produced and sold in Britain, across Europe and in the British colonies. 7 To call published science writing intended for a wide readership \u2018popular science\u2019 is not without its problems, 8 and the term \u2018popularization\u2019 has proved hard to disconnect from the idea of transmission of learned elite knowledge, perhaps in diluted form, to non-elite consumers. 9 Keene's term helps to avoid these problems by making \u2018familiar science\u2019 texts those that deploy a conversational format and lessons that were centred on using everyday objects or were set in the domestic sphere. 10 The authors I discuss tended, then, to avoid complex scientific jargon and instead adopt \u2018familiar\u2019 formats, in domestic environments, to establish a close relationship with their readers. This paper builds upon earlier discussions of female naturalists, natural philosophers and, especially, science writers 11 to show that the domestic sphere, rather than being a homogeneous entity, was a creative resource for female writers, who represented it in a multiplicity of ways. I examine a group of female authors who collectively but distinctively re-imagined a variety of domestic spheres each of which was an arena for \u2018familiar science\u2019. Although I draw in this paper upon the work of many authors, I have chosen to focus on three of the best known female scientific writers of this period, each of whom offered different ideas regarding education, especially scientific education, in the domestic sphere: Priscilla Wakefield (1751\u20131832), an English educational writer and member of the Religious Society of Friends; Jane Marcet (1769\u20131858), an English writer best known for her Conversations series; and Maria Edgeworth (1768\u20131849), a prolific Anglo-Irish author and educationalist. How were these imagined domestic spheres, the venues of familiar science, equipped, moralized and organized? Were hygrometers, chemical cabinets and elaborate gardens in easy reach of privileged characters\u2014or did poorer figures make do with the simplest household items? Were such homes places of religious practice, with God's creation displayed, or sites of utility, with science beneficially applied to cookery? Were fictional beginners in science destined to remain passive recipients for ever or might they exercise the liberty to pursue their own interests, to challenge the authority of their siblings, friends and teachers? In this paper I argue that the works of Wakefield, Marcet and Edgeworth depicted varying domestic spheres within which the child's education, the role of women in science and pedagogy, and the values of science were all explored. Priscilla Wakefield: observation, reflection and conversation in the domestic sphere Priscilla Wakefield's books present a familiar, intimate and private relationship between parents and children in the domestic sphere. Wakefield used her own experiences of educating her children and grandchildren when she constructed familiar science texts for the middle classes and wealthier families. 12 Although Wakefield's works for children focus on the practical and on common sense, the author also made her books lively and entertaining. 13 Wakefield's Domestic Recreations: Or, Dialogues Illustrative of Natural and Scientific Subjects (1805), epitomized her middle-class ideal of embracing scientific pursuits as a family and within the domestic sphere. From the comfort of their own home, Mrs Dimsdale's children, Emily and Lucy, view a collection of dried insects, use a microscope to inspect greenfly and hair-like insects, examine sea anemone specimens and observe a rainbow from a bedroom window, from which Mrs Dimsdale explains the refraction of light. 14 Knowledge of Wakefield's Quaker beliefs helps us to understand why she situated her writings within the domestic sphere. Wakefield's emphasis upon the intimacy and closeness of the family, and her concern for women, as pupils and as teachers, is simultaneously present throughout her writing. This in turn dictated how the readers of her works were expected to mimic Wakefield's prescribed domestic sphere. Wakefield stressed throughout Domestic Recreations that her goal was to instil the habit of reflection and encourage attentive observation in her readers, for without these skills \u2018books and instruction are of little avail to enrich the mind, though with it they are admirable assistants\u2019. 15 This emphasis on \u2018observation\u2019 and \u2018reflection\u2019 stemmed from Wakefield's Quaker affiliations. 16 At the time Wakefield was writing, Quakers rarely cited the Bible in their discussions of the physical world, seeking instead to comprehend through the senses the observable world created by God. 17 The design arguments typical of the period were used by Quakers; but Quakers placed a special premium on the direct experience of observing God's creation. In the opening of Wakefield's An Introduction to Botany in a Series of Familiar Letters (1796), Wakefield explained that her motives for writing the book were to: cultivate a taste in young persons for the study of nature, which is the most familiar means of introducing suitable ideas of the attributes of the Divine being, by exemplifying them in the order and harmony of the visible creation. Quakers emphasized that the end result of careful observation of the physical properties of a specimen was an appreciation of the beauty and artistry of the Maker. In An Introduction to Botany , a clear and simple exposition of Linnaean classes, orders and genera is provided, but the true goal of imparting and receiving this scientific education is reinforced by Wakefield: The finger of the Divine Artist is visible in the most minute of his works; let us be excited to observe them with the greatest attention; they will not only supply us with present amusement and wonder, but will serve as a hidden treasure to alleviate the solitude and wearisomeness of old age. In An Introduction to Botany , a combination of books and natural specimens is used in the education of the young Felicia, but, as reiterated by Felicia herself, a greater emphasis is put on the experience of handling specimens than reading about them: \u2018I am fearful, my dear sister, that you are fatigued with these tedious definitions and descriptions of parts; to me they have been rendered more agreeable as I have become acquainted with them from visible objects.\u2019 18 Through the text's detailed descriptions, readers are informed of what they will be expected to discover in their own observations: an understanding of the physical properties of a flower, and an appreciation of the beauty of a flower as a creation of God. For Quakers, hands-on, experimental science was prized because it offered a chance to reveal more about the eternal purposes of God while avoiding the idleness of contemplation. 19 Indeed, Mrs Harcourt, in Wakefield's Mental Improvement (1794), warns her children never to be unemployed: \u2018[R]ead, draw, work, walk\u2014accustom yourself to observe everything you see with attention.\u2019 20 Wakefield's domestic sphere was a setting where there were no idle children; all members of the household could have, and were encouraged to have, direct experiences with nature every day. Wakefield's religious affiliation with Quakerism motivated her to write scientific books aimed at women readers. Camilla Leach has argued that there was a prominent role to be played by women in both the public and private spheres of the Religious Society of Friends, as Quakers believed that the soul had no gender. 21 However, although women had power and autonomy within the Quaker movement, their position was not one of equality. Science writing, especially of an elementary or introductory nature, gave women one of their few entr\u00e9es to science and authorship. 22 Nevertheless, the provision of science education within Quakerism does not appear to have been differentiated by gender. A firm belief in equality of elementary education for boys and girls is apparent in Wakefield's Reflections on the Present Condition of the Female Sex (1798). Echoing the words of Mary Wollstonecraft, Wakefield argued that women possessed the same mental powers as men, but did not know how to use them because their intellectual faculties had been confined by narrow and ill-directed modes of education. Wakefield remained concerned that women retain their modesty and decorum, but she did not see women's pursuit of various branches of science as impinging upon the \u2018peculiar characteristics of their sex\u2019. Rather, in Reflections she claimed: A knowledge of the customs and manners of different nations, geography, chemistry, electricity, botany \u2026 may each in succession fill up a leisure opportunity with innocence and usefulness, and become a pleasing antidote to the indolent habit of loitering away time in an unprofitable manner \u2026 Wakefield considered \u2018showy, superficial accomplishments\u2019 to be redundant in marriage. Instead, she felt that women contemplating marriage ought to be educated in science to help them manage their domestic affairs, look after their husband's finances and educate their children. Wakefield considered maternal instruction to be preferable to education in schools. Indeed, she considered it improper for children and women to be educated outside the family home: \u2018[D]omestic privacy is the only sure asylum for the juvenile part of the sex; nor can the grave matron step far beyond that boundary with propriety.\u2019 23 Wakefield's sentiments are reflected in An Introduction to Botany as Felicia does not venture beyond the garden and the adjacent fields or beyond a domestic arena in her scientific education. However, Wakefield also warned women that excessive attention to their education would be detrimental to their domestic duties. For working women, Wakefield's Reflections recommended only basic literacy, numeracy and bible studies; there was little point learning mathematics beyond the level required for domestic book-keeping. 24 Wakefield did not see the need for a woman living in a poor household to attain a scientific education. Instead, Wakefield proposed that such a woman should be taught how to clean her house and how to wash and mend clothes \u2018to prepare them to become useful servants, or as the wives of labourers\u2019. 25 Very different was Wakefield's portrayal of the domestic spheres of the middle to upper classes, where an intelligent and knowledgeable woman such as Mrs Dimsdale would conduct interesting experiments and instructional conversation with her children. Finding out why readers chose Wakefield's books and how they used them is challenging. Aileen Fyfe has suggested that readers of Wakefield, or other educationalists, may have chosen to purchase the author's works because they harboured similar sentiments towards education, women and religion. 26 Potential purchasers associated different kinds of content and format with different publishers, and bought accordingly to suit their beliefs and values. The publisher of Wakefield's Reflections , Joseph Johnson, was renowned for publishing authors who were connected with the dissenting academies. 27 That said, Helen Braithwaite has argued that all too often Johnson has been presented as a \u2018radical\u2019, despite the fact that his list of authors was diverse. 28 Johnson's interest in serious didactic publishing for children continues to be solely attributed to having been fostered by dissenting educational writers such as Joseph Priestley and Anna Laetitia Aikin (Barbauld). 29 Due to internal divisions within religious communities, we cannot assume that all Quaker readers agreed with all of the content of the texts which Quakers distributed, nor did all Quaker writers agree with each other. 30 Wakefield's An Introduction to Botany , published by a Quaker, William Darton, went through 17 editions in the century after its publication; this book undoubtedly found its way into non-Quaker homes. This may be attributed to An Introduction to Botany being far cheaper than existing introductory texts; Wakefield hoped that it filled a niche in the market which other botanical writers had not adequately exploited. 31 Moreover, changes in Quakerism throughout the eighteenth century paralleled the decline in their radical ethos and the emergence of Quakerism as a middle-class, family-oriented denomination. 32 While Quakerism undoubtedly shaped Wakefield's writing, its impact on those who purchased or read her works is less decisive. If we consider the format of Wakefield's books, we can see that they allowed readers to replicate Wakefield's idealized domestic situation for educating children. Science is endorsed by Wakefield as an everyday activity, which could take place without any specialist equipment within the family home. In the opening of Mental Improvement , Wakefield claimed that a \u2018judicious instructor will find matter for a lesson among those objects, that are termed common or insignificant\u2019. 33 Having selected an object on which to focus, Wakefield promoted familial conversation about the object as a free and integral part of learning. 34 Despite Wakefield's emphasis on the use of \u2018common objects\u2019 found in the family home, her educational scenarios were predominantly set in privileged households that could afford governesses, family outings and at least some scientific equipment. In contrast, Harriet Martineau's Household Education (1848) depicted a domestic sphere without books, pens and paper to hand. Martineau suggested that mothers could use pins or peppercorns to teach their children to count, understanding that she could not expect a family to own any particular tools or materials. In rural properties, where the children routinely participated in daily chores and therefore had little time for book-learning, Martineau proposed that children could be taught the names of the trees, flowers and birds in their surroundings while they were working. 35 Martineau suggested throughout Household Education that, even in the poorest households, lessons were possible. Wakefield's characters all enjoy science as a communal pursuit. In both Mental Improvement and Domestic Recreations , the entire family is engaged in scientific conversation. Every family member has a conversational role, a fact which may have made her books appealing to an intergenerational audience. In the preface of Domestic Recreations , Wakefield claims that when she selected subjects for the book she chose topics about which she felt a family would be likely to have extensive conversations. 36 Wakefield recommended these conversations be kept entertaining, instructive and short. 37 In Mental Improvement , Mr and Mrs Harcourt's children are always hungry for more knowledge, but their parents know when to end their evening conversations, despite Henry's begging: \u2018I am not very sleepy, and could sit a great while longer to hear papa tell us more about these large whales, and mountains of ice.\u2019 38 Wakefield's didactic narratives have been compared to Christian catechisms in which children learnt answers to questions by rote, yet Wakefield gave her child characters a degree of autonomy. In An Introduction to Botany , Felicia recommends that her sister \u2018proceed step by step, and make [her]self perfectly acquainted with the classes\u2019 since \u2018science depends so much on memory and minute definitions\u2019. 39 The question and answer format chosen by Wakefield might have separated teacher and learner, reinforcing distinctions between knowledge producers and consumers. 40 Yet in Wakefield's An Introduction to Botany , the learner, Felicia, becomes the teacher as she disseminates her newly acquired knowledge to her sister. Family conversation in Mental Improvement might appear to be driven by parents who chose the topics to be discussed. 41 Perhaps this is why Wakefield's works have been compared to Sarah Trimmer's Christian catechisms of the 1780s. 42 But the children in Wakefield's Mental Improvement do not lack freedom in their choice of studies. The daughter of the Harcourt family featured in Mental Improvement keeps and augments a cabinet of natural rarities of her own accord. 43 The same autonomy can be seen in An Introduction to Botany when Felicia discusses the dissection of flowers, for it is she who recommends which simple household tools should be used for dissection. 44 Wakefield's pupil characters were not passive recipients of their parents' or instructors' lessons. They were active participants in scientific activities to be copied by child readers. In Wakefield's domestic sphere, science was taught under the guidance of parents, or a governess, and was to be enjoyed by children of both sexes as a rational pursuit in affluent households. Her dual concern with science and pedagogy was undoubtedly shaped by her affiliation with Quakerism. Throughout her educational books Wakefield's domestic sphere provided her pupils with ample opportunity to have direct experiences with nature. The outcome of such an education would be that children would gain an ever greater independent understanding of the world which God had created for them. Another key ingredient for Wakefield's domestic sphere was the allowance of time for private, familiar conversation which would engage the family. Although her child characters appeared to have their own unique scientific interests, adults were ever-present to offer their guidance and support. However, Wakefield's opinions on what constituted the ideal domestic setting for scientific lessons were not shared by all of her contemporaries. In the following sections I explore alternative domestic spheres. Jane Marcet: the well-equipped domestic laboratory Jane Marcet's \u2018familiar science\u2019 writing featured a country house, an authoritative mother figure and eager pupils with access to a ready supply of scientific materials. The roots of her husband, the Geneva-born chemist and physician Alexandre Marcet, partially explain why Marcet chose to situate her science writing within a domestic sphere. Geneva's social and political system reinforced the development of science among the ruling classes, and Genevan patricians were personally responsible for the education of their children. Girls were often educated alongside their brothers, and mothers took a leading role in their children's education and in their husband's work. 45 As I have suggested, a middle-class or elite education in a British home would often have involved \u2018familiar conversation\u2019 for the whole family to teach children subjects ranging from history to manners. 46 Jane Marcet's \u2018conversations\u2019 covered a vast array of topics, but her scientific conversations are her most well-known. Marcet's domestic sphere brought elements of the laboratory into the home in order to render scientific subjects approachable to her readers. Specifically, Marcet was aiming to introduce science into women's lives. Marcet also appears to have had a utilitarian motivation for providing women with a scientific platform within the home. Jane Marcet's dialogue Conversations on Chemistry (1806) features an authoritative female mentor, Mrs B, and her novice pupils, Emily and Caroline. These characters and their discourse enabled readers to grasp the essentials of chemistry in the home. Marcet ensures that her readers first establish a basic knowledge of the subjects covered before attempting more complex topics. For example, when Emily questions Mrs B on why light causes endive to grow white instead of green, Mrs B encourages Emily's curiosity but responds with: \u2018This I cannot explain to you until you have obtained a further knowledge of chemistry.\u2019 Mrs B then promptly turns the conversation to a more basic explanation of heat and light. 47 Later Emily asks if Mrs B could show her an experiment \u2018in which liquids, by being mixed, become solid, and disengage latent heat\u2019. Again, Mrs B informs Emily that she is \u2018not sufficiently advanced to understand them well\u2019; but Mrs B makes it apparent that she is aware of many experiments of this nature and that she could perform them in the home. 48 The domestic sphere designed by Marcet did not prevent Mrs B from performing more complex experiments; a concern with her pupils' understanding did. Through Mrs B, Marcet made it clear that there was little point in carrying out an experiment when the purpose and result were not understood by its observers. To develop the understanding of her readers, Marcet employed figurative illustrations and descriptions of sensory experiences from everyday life as familiar explanatory tools. 49 Hands are converted into scientific instruments: \u2018If you lay your hand successively on every object in the room, you will discover which are good, and which are bad conductors of heat, by the different degrees of cold you feel.\u2019 50 The simplest objects are employed by Mrs B as aids in defining scientific terms: a loaf of bread, for example, explains the difference between \u2018division\u2019 and \u2018decomposition\u2019. 51 In this period, common objects such as coal, pebbles, feathers, candles or, indeed, loaves of bread were all used to provide a familiar entry-point into the sciences. Existing knowledge could be exploited and reworked to \u2018open the eyes\u2019 of the audience to the wondrous world they inhabited. 52 Hands-on experimentation with common objects is also recommended in Conversations on Vegetable Physiology (1829). Readers are told that they could ascertain the age of a tree by counting the layers at either end of a cut log. The character Emily admits to readers: \u2018I little thought I could ever have taken so much interest in a log of firewood.\u2019 Mrs B responds that \u2018when studied in a philosophical point of view, they are no less objects of interest and admiration\u2019. 53 Despite the simplicity of these experiments with everyday things, the readers of Marcet's Conversations series were confronted with wealthy, educated characters that had access to expensive scientific equipment or luxuries. This is the same paradox which is presented throughout Wakefield's books. In Conversations on Chemistry , pieces of apparatus, such as a pyrometer and an air pump, and a wide variety of chemicals are used. When Mrs B explains the crystallization of carbon by displaying her diamond ring to her pupils she also reveals the wealth of some of Marcet's characters. Marcet also expected her readers to have access to certain scientific equipment. In a footnote to one experiment she recommended introducing a thermometer through a cork into a bottle to show how much water cools while boiling. 54 Many introductory chemical works in this period similarly required a combination of household equipment and apparatus purchased especially for the job. Marcet assumed that her female readers would have received a limited education and therefore explained in the preface of her Conversations on Chemistry that she would be adopting the tried and tested format of familiar conversation: Familiar conversation was, in studying of this kind, a most useful auxiliary source of information; and more especially to the female sex, whose education is seldom calculated to prepare their minds for abstract ideas, or scientific language. 55 Saba Bahar has argued that Marcet's address of an exclusively feminine audience, actually promoted the exclusion of women from any participation in intellectual and professional activity beyond an introductory level. 56 Bahar's critique of Conversations concluded that Marcet taught women to enjoy the pleasures of the rational mind and to participate in the conversational world of learning, but then did women a disfavour by failing to encourage them to abandon domestic seclusion. 57 Marcet felt the need to publish her work anonymously for a number of years, and she was self-deprecating in her preface to Conversations on Chemistry : \u2018[My] knowledge on the subject is but recent, and as [I] can have no real claims to the title of chemist.\u2019 58 In the opening pages of Conversations on Chemistry , Mrs B warns her female pupils that pharmacy \u2018properly belongs to professional men, and is therefore the last that I should advise you to study\u2019. 59 Since Marcet did not propose to inspire women to forge scientific careers outside the domestic sphere, I suggest it is inappropriate to criticize her work for failing to discuss the career prospects of a scientifically educated female. Rather than focus on authorial limitations, we might consider the benefits to women from reading Marcet's works and, in turn, gain a greater understanding of Marcet's audience. In a period when familiar conversation was highly valued, 60 Marcet taught women to \u2018participate in the conversational world of learning\u2019, providing a vital accomplishment for those in middle- and upper-class society, whether or not they went on to apply their knowledge outside the domestic sphere. The domestic sphere which Marcet portrayed was, like that of Wakefield's literary creations, one of privilege. Marcet's imaginary households were ones in which educated and affluent adults participated in polite conversation with their children as an integral part of their offspring's upbringing. Marcet's Conversations on Chemistry is a prime example of text which blurred the lines between private and public, or institutional, education and which easily found readers beyond British shores. The readers of Marcet's Conversations extended far beyond her named female audience: copies of Conversations on Chemistry have been discovered in libraries, colleges and mechanics' institutes. 61 The instruction in Conversations on Chemistry promoted feminine interest in science to a level which exceeded that required for mere domestic efficiency. 62 Discussions of the steam engine and agricultural science had little bearing on domestic chores. Marcet followed Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier's scheme of classification of the elements and she also cited the theories of contemporary natural philosophers and chemists. Marcet's focus on chemical theory and hands-on laboratory instruction for female beginners in Conversations on Chemistry may explain why the book was adopted by American academies over other texts which argued for domestic and religious applications of scientific knowledge. 63 However, the association between Conversations on Chemistry and the domestic sphere should not be dismissed. Marcet's promotion of science as a domestic activity and for a female audience created a forum in which her female readership could undertake chemistry. Marcet effectively brought the science of Humphry Davy into the domestic sphere because that was where she thought her intended audience would understand chemistry best. 64 With such a socially and culturally diverse readership, Marcet knew that no specialist knowledge was to be presupposed. 65 Marcet only included experiments in her Conversations on Chemistry which could feasibly be carried out by her readers, albeit in a well-equipped home. Therefore, Marcet pointedly accepted her exclusion from the public forum, and instead she chose to create a domestic sphere that specifically catered to teaching women scientific subjects. Marcet's religious motivations appear, unlike Wakefield's, to be subsidiary in her science writing whereas questions of utility loom large. When Caroline asks Mrs B why they cannot create diamonds or why any attempt to create imitations of diamonds proves fruitless, Mrs B explains that a diamond's formation \u2018is a secret that rests in the bosom of the Creator\u2019. 66 Conversations on Chemistry did not justify studying chemistry by appealing to the goal of revealing the Creator's works. Although Marcet implied in her Conversations on Vegetable Physiology that \u2018lessons of piety\u2019 are to be learnt in studying any natural science, the phrase appears almost as an afterthought when Caroline refers to botany as merely \u2018the dry classification of flowers\u2019. 67 On the other hand, Marcet seems to have approached her writing with a more utilitarian purpose than Wakefield. Conversations on Vegetable Physiology provided useful information about soil, the structure of seeds and diseases in plants. A similar theme appears in Conversations on Botany (1817), a book probably resulting from a collaboration between Marcet and Sarah and Elizabeth Fitton. The anonymous author or authors of Conversations on Botany discussed the usefulness of botany for physicians by emphasizing the medical properties of specimens examined. 68 Such utilitarian motivations are common in contemporary literature aimed at female emigrants living in the British colonies. Catharine Parr Traill's The Backwoods of Canada (1836), for example, although not intended as an exclusively scientific text, makes numerous references to the study of botany and to subjects which required a beginner's knowledge in chemistry; Parr Traill's female emigrant should \u2018become skilled in the arts of boiling sugar, candle and soap-making, the making and baking of huge loaves \u2026 She must know how to manufacture hop-rising or salt-rising for leavening her bread\u2019. 69 Books promoting science, and especially useful science, from within the domestic sphere might be popular in the most challenging environments beyond Britain. It has been suggested that Longmans published Conversations on Botany as a rival to Wakefield's Introduction to Botany . 70 The books were roughly the same length. Both taught botany as a part of domestic education and both included plates and a table of the Linnaean classes. However, the authors of Conversations on Botany appealed to a wider audience. Instead of Wakefield's governess, Marcet's authoritative figure is a mother. Marcet did not assume that all of her readers would relate to being educated by a governess. Instead, a mother could read Conversations on Botany to her child without having any previous knowledge of the subject, and still have an active role in her child's education. Marcet chose a male character to be the pupil in her book, which may have been a ploy to make the text more attractive to children of both sexes. Unlike the expensive equipment that Marcet's characters use in Conversations on Chemistry , Edward and his mother in Conversations on Botany explore the botanical world using only a magnifying glass, a needle and a sharp pointed pen-knife. 71 The main text reiterates the fact that many botanical specimens of the different Linnaean classes grow in the family garden. 72 Once again, Marcet accepted the domestic parameters she had set for herself: in her exploration of a scientific subject, she created a domestic sphere where all the tools and specimens that she required could be easily located. The publishers of Conversations on Chemistry , Longmans, had been leading members of the book trade since 1724, and they had always had some involvement with the trade in school books and educational works. On the back of publications like Conversations on Chemistry , Longmans became phenomenally large and powerful; Marcet's Conversations on Chemistry was so clear in its explanations and instruction that it was adopted as the favoured introductory chemistry book across many American classrooms. 73 In comparison, Marcet's friend, Mary Somerville, relished the specialist aspects of her writings in natural philosophy, and contemporaries remarked that Somerville wrote so expertly that she could not be understood by an audience outside the universities. 74 John Murray was reluctant to publish any more of Somerville's mathematically complex texts after her translation of Mechanism of the Heavens . Publishers recognized that more money could be earned from cosy, domestic narratives rather than intimidating, specialist books, particularly if these domestic narratives could be used by readers both at home or in schools. The messages which Somerville and Marcet sent out to their readers differed greatly. Somerville, rather discouragingly, in the opening of Mechanism of the Heavens informed her readers that \u2018a complete acquaintance with physical astronomy can only be attained by those well versed in the higher branches of mathematical and mechanical science\u2019. 75 However, the readers of Marcet's Conversations on Botany were told that botany \u2018is so simple and pleasing a study, that the youngest persons can understand it, when properly explained to them\u2019. 76 Nevertheless, Somerville recognized the value of Marcet's books in her Personal Recollections, From Early Life to Old Age (1874): So many books have now been published for young people, that no one at this time can duly estimate the importance of Mrs. Marcet's scientific works. To them is partly owing that higher intellectual education now beginning to prevail among the better classes in Britain. 77 Somerville's praise suggests that Marcet's books had been most influential on the education of the middle and upper classes; but, as we have seen, the audience for Marcet's books extended far beyond these classes and, indeed, Britain. In Marcet's domestic sphere, household activities were assimilated with scientific explorations in order to create a space where science could be made understandable to a reader with the most limited prior scientific knowledge. However, in order to make chemistry and botany suitable subjects to be taught in the home, Marcet had to bring elements of the laboratory and its paraphernalia into the domestic setting; her characters required access to a wide variety of chemicals and botanical specimens at home, far wider than that possessed by the majority of the population. The use of affluent characters and specialist equipment are notable similarities between Wakefield and Marcet's domestic spheres, but there are also a number of significant differences between them. Marcet stressed the practical purposes of attaining a scientific education, as opposed to Wakefield's more spiritual motivations. While Wakefield emphasized the benefits of familial conversation across all age groups in her domestic sphere, Marcet's domestic sphere tended to use a limited number of characters, and the control of the lessons lay with a lone authoritative figure. In short, their imagined domestic spheres were different. Maria Edgeworth: the pursuit of autonomy and contentment through domestic education In his Emile (1762), Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that children should receive a private domestic education, which involved the input of the mother, rather than a public education. Rousseau considered that the education which children received in the home was more \u2018wholesome\u2019 and \u2018sensible\u2019 than that in public schools and colleges, a belief not dissimilar to Wollstonecraft's in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman . A preference for domestic education is just one of the many Rousseauvian themes adopted in Maria and Richard Lovell Edgeworth's treatise Practical Education (1798). For Maria Edgeworth, science education in the domestic sphere could introduce children to rational principles through hands-on experimentation and it could also improve a woman's performance of her duties within the home. Edgeworth used the domestic sphere in her novels, alongside her instructional books, to highlight the dangers and the moral benefits that science could bring to the household and its constituents. Her Harry and Lucy series provided readers with her idealized vision of a child's scientific education; in Maria Edgeworth's domestic sphere, children were permitted time to explore the world of science without adult authority, they enjoyed access to innumerable books and a range of scientific equipment, and they were taken on interesting and educational family outings. Rousseau, like Edgeworth, stressed the importance of self-reliance and on \u2018hardening\u2019 through experience: \u2018He wants to touch and handle everything; do not check these movements which teach him invaluable lessons. Thus he learns to perceive the heat, cold, hardness, softness, weight, or lightness of bodies.\u2019 78 Inculcating this sort of independence in children flew in the face of other theorists who clung to the idea that children needed to be instilled with the virtues of adulthood and have their vices condemned at a young age. 79 For example, Sarah Trimmer's An Essay on Christian Education (1812) advised that parental authority was needed when a child could \u2018run about from place to place, to lay hold of what he pleases, and to demand what he wants\u2019. Trimmer feared that independence needed to be checked: otherwise it would \u2018produce a habit of wilfulness that will render him uncomfortable to himself and very troublesome to all about him\u2019. 80 Edgeworth, on the other hand, argued that if children could apply their knowledge and exercise their senses through direct experience, then their interest would be held and they would be more likely to remember what they have been taught. 81 This was particularly relevant in teaching chemistry to children; Edgeworth proposed that objects the \u2018principal properties of which may be easily discriminated by the senses of touch, taste, or smell\u2019 should be chosen. 82 The Edgeworths disagreed, however, with Rousseau on female education. Rousseau had written in Emile that \u2018woman is made to please and to be in subjection to men, she ought to make herself pleasing in his eyes and not provoke him to anger; her strength is in her charms, by their means she should compel him to discover and use his strength\u2019. 83 Edgeworth, like Wollstonecraft and Wakefield, rejected the notion that women's education should focus on acquiring charming accomplishments; Edgeworth wrote that \u2018domestic happiness\u2019 ought to be preferred over training daughters in fashionable accomplishments for public admiration. 84 In Edgeworth's novel Belinda , published in 1801, the character of Lady Delacour blames her misfortunes on the fact that she had led \u2018a life of folly\u2019 and had had \u2018lovers in abundance\u2019. Lady Delacour admits \u2018that in the midst of the utmost luxury and dissipation, she had been a constant prey to ennui; that the want of domestic happiness could never be supplied by that public admiration\u2019. A deliberate comparison is made between the characters of Lady Delacour and Lady Anne Percival; Lady Anne is introduced to the reader as \u2018in the midst of her children\u2019 and is described as exhibiting \u2018unconstrained cheerfulness\u2019, while Lady Delacour's \u2018wit and gayety\u2019 seemed forced. 85 One reader of Edgeworth's works, writing under the pseudonym \u2018A Mother\u2019, echoed Edgeworth's sentiments in her own book on \u2018domestic education\u2019: The unpardonable folly of women sneering at superior knowledge and talent in the gifted portion of their own sex, is as vulgar as it is ungenerous and unwise. 86 Edgeworth saw no reason for women to be idle at home; instead she validated the domestic sphere and celebrated women's \u2018private situation\u2019 as one in which women had the time for extensive reading which professional men lacked. 87 In her Letters for Literary Ladies (1795), Edgeworth does not challenge the notion of separate spheres for different sexes: rather, women's exclusion from the world of professional specialism allowed women to acquire the evenly developed and comprehensive knowledge necessary for meaningful conversation in the home. 88 Belinda sketched the ideological position that domestic life was the social ideal, and commitment to rational development of the female understanding was the surest means to happiness. It is through Belinda's cultivation of her own rationality that she comes to recognize that domesticity \u2018could alone make her really and permanently happy\u2019. 89 The domestic life which Edgeworth endorsed for women also entailed scientific education. In Letters for Literary Ladies chemistry is promoted as a science for women: [Chemistry] is suited to their talents and to their situation. Chemistry is not a science of parade, it affords occupation and infinite variety; it demands no bodily strength, it can be pursued in retirement, it applies immediately to useful and domestic purposes. 90 The authors of Conversations on Botany (with Marcet likely among them) had applied the very same words to their discussion of the benefits of botanical education for women . 91 Letters for Literary Ladies discussed scientific education and the development of rationality and reasoning within the limits of its application to the domestic sphere; Edgeworth's intent, like Marcet's, was not for women to aspire to careers in science; rather, the study of chemistry was to be applied to domestic tasks such as cookery. 92 Edgeworth was critical of those who used chemical experiments as a magic show; she argued that if a child were properly educated, he or she would find amusement in searching for the causes of observed effects rather than expressing blind admiration of tricks. 93 Edgeworth issued grave warnings about science in her novels, expressing particular concern over new dangers emerging in industrial spaces and about the disruptive potential created by new military technologies. 94 However, a more fundamental concern over the improper use of science in the domestic sphere can also be seen in Edgeworth's writing. In Edgeworth's Forester , published in 1801, a cat suffers a gruesome death when it knocks a bottle of sulphuric acid on to itself after the antagonist, Archibald Mackenzie, had idly removed the stopper in the domestic laboratory of the Campbell family. Similarly, in Forester an elderly woman passes out because of a pan of burning charcoal kept in her bedchamber\u2014not, as an uninformed apothecary erroneously suggests, because of the proximity of a geranium. Provision of a scientific education in the domestic sphere was for Edgeworth a matter of life and death. The character of Henry Campbell in Forester exemplifies the finished product of an Edgeworthian education: as well as having \u2018more useful energy\u2019, Campbell \u2018was always employed, he was really independent because he had learned how to support himself either by the labours of his head or his hands; but his independence did not render him unsociable\u2019. It is Campbell's superior knowledge that prevents the endangered elderly woman from repeating her mistake. Again, Campbell's scientific education allows him to explain the poisoning of a canary from everyday objects. 95 Accurate scientific knowledge thus illustrated, explained and limited the dangers of the domestic sphere. Readers' responses to Edgeworth's pedagogical theories differed. Practical Education was commercially successful; three editions of the text were printed. However, the Edgeworths faced criticisms, particularly for ignoring the role of religion in science education, 96 even though they had explained that their silence on religious matters was necessary if they wished to address all parties rather than only one. 97 The Edgeworths did not share Wakefield's religious motivation to write about science and the domestic sphere, or indeed Sarah Trimmer's, who had insisted that \u2018nothing should be said to children of the principles of science, till they have been taught the first principles of religion, and have acquired a habit of thinking of God, and their duty\u2019. 98 Trimmer's Christian Education also warned against the dangers of teaching chemistry and of texts which advocate experimentation. 99 Although Maria Edgeworth shared Trimmer's concerns over the safety of her readers, unlike Trimmer she faced the subject head-on and explored the dangers of experiments in her writings, so as to remedy any hazards. For \u2018A Mother\u2019, seeing her children return time and again to the bookcase to read Edgeworth's books was a great comfort to her: Very early in life, we discover which are the books that calm our feelings and fortify our virtue, and to those books we should resort, as to mental food and medicine. Miss Edgeworth's works have this effect in a very singular degree, and very young children are seen perpetually recurring to her pages. 100 The anonymous reader goes on to explain that instructional and rational books such as Edgeworth's, rather than books which exercised the reader's imagination, are \u2018most favourable to mental amelioration\u2019. 101 However, despite their lack of an obvious fantastical element, Edgeworth's books did attempt to combine education and entertainment. Edgeworth's Harry and Lucy series was written in a novelistic narrative format, taking a different approach to conversation from that taken by Marcet; Edgeworth's child characters conversed with each other far more than they did with their tutors. Edgeworth explained that this was because \u2018children can go on talking to one another much longer than they can bear to hear the address, however wise or eloquent, of one grown person\u2019. In the preface of Harry and Lucy Concluded: Being the last part of Early Lessons , published in 1825, Edgeworth explained that the miscellaneous approach and domestic setting interspersed with trips to factories, mountains and other locations was to hold children's attention and create sufficient action. It is in accordance with Edgeworth's emphasis on immediate experience and observation that Harry and Lucy are taken out of the domestic sphere to view industrial processes first-hand. Harry claims that a trip to a cotton mill was made pleasurable by being able to recognize each part of the machinery from the engravings and descriptions which he had studied in the home. 102 Despite Edgeworth's acknowledgement that a scientific education extended beyond the domestic sphere, the education which was received in the home was viewed as a building block for further studies; domestic education in science was necessary to render outings beneficial and interesting. 103 Like Wakefield's and Marcet's characters, Edgeworth's Harry and Lucy come from a privileged household; they have access to scientific instruments such as a portable barometer and hygrometer. It has been suggested, again, that Harry and Lucy invokes authority, rather than experience, as the source of learning; 104 yet Harry shows his autonomy by climbing a ladder on to the church roof to take readings using his portable barometer, and he is left doing the calculations once back on the ground. Harry's tutors encourage him to use scientific equipment, rather than watch an adult use it, and to work out his enquiries alone so as to inspire him to be independent. The character's decisions and actions truly reflect the Edgeworthian educational method; Harry has a direct involvement in the experiment and is granted autonomy from any adult involvement. Lucy, too, professes when using the air pump that \u2018there is nothing like working oneself; it fixes a thing so well in my memory I remember the look and touch of things much better afterwards\u2019. It is only as a safety precaution that Harry and Lucy's father carried out an experiment for them which involved sulphuric acid. It could be said that Edgeworth did remove authority from the mother of Harry and Lucy by putting the father in charge of the experiment, when Marcet had entrusted experiments to the knowledgeable Mrs B in Conversations on Chemistry . Following the principles laid out in Practical Education and Letters for Literary Ladies , Lucy did receive a scientific education in Harry and Lucy . However, Lucy's scientific education was calculated to make her a better companion to a future husband and to ensure she was always self-improving. She is warned by her mother never to boast of her knowledge for that will make her \u2018troublesome and disagreeable\u2019. 105 Harry did not receive the same warning. The term \u2018pioneer\u2019 has been assigned to Maria Edgeworth for her theories on women's scientific education. 106 However, Edgeworth was not breaking new ground when she emphasized that scientific education for women was, first and foremost, to benefit their performance in the domestic sphere. While defending the virtues of rational improvement and understanding, Edgeworth tended to be accommodating of women's domestic situation and of the status quo. Prior to the Edgeworths' Practical Education , pedagogues had expressed their preference for home education above the public school to meet the needs of each individual child. In Maria Edgeworth's domestic sphere, the basic principles, dangers and usefulness of science could all be discovered, tested and put into practice. Children could experiment and learn with relatively little interference from family members and educational authorities such as the governess. A woman's happiness came from being able to apply knowledge, including scientific knowledge, to the domestic sphere in order to improve herself, her family and her home. Conclusion In this paper I have examined some of the different ways in which female writers placed \u2018familiar science\u2019 within the domestic sphere, commented on authors' varying motivations for writing in these ways and explained how the domestic sphere took on subtle but significant differences in each case. The case studies suggest that these varied writings, and inferred motivations, reflected wider contemporary debates. What role should religion play within scientific education? Should children be educated at home or in a public institution? Why should women be educated on scientific subjects at all? I have argued that the books under scrutiny projected the idea that a wealthy household, with educated occupants and a range of tools to work with, created the ideal variety of domestic sphere from which to provide women and children with a scientific education. None of my key authors actively encouraged women to embark on scientific careers, beyond the home and into the public sphere. Wakefield pictured women engaging with science within the domestic sphere for the benefit of their families. Marcet used a country house as her setting: her female readers were not leaving the domestic sphere to pursue scientific subjects. Edgeworth depicted the happiness which women could achieve if they were simultaneously rational and oriented towards the home. The authors discussed in this paper advocated hands-on experimentation in the domestic sphere and paid tribute to contemporary science throughout their works. These writers made the presumption that their readers would have access to the same diverse set of tools and specimens as their privileged characters. Certainly these characters belonged to the wealthy and educated classes: they dwelled in expansive, rural homes under the instruction of a knowledgeable governess, or received their education from devoted parental tutors. Despite some similarities, the domestic sphere as imagined in familiar science texts was not an unchanging and uniform space. Each writer's domestic sphere was different, reflecting authors' divergence in the use of educational tropes, in their religious affiliations and in the roles assigned to their imagined tutors and learners. The domestic sphere was sometimes depicted as a place of religious practice: Wakefield, consistent with Quaker beliefs, created a domestic sphere where children benefited from direct experience of science and the natural world to cultivate more general habits of observation and reflection. However, when Marcet and Edgeworth promoted scientific education in the domestic sphere, their sights were set on utility more than religious practice. Scientific knowledge is learnt with the intention of being applied to household tasks such as cookery, gardening and the education of others. Varied hierarchical distinctions existed within these imagined domestic spheres. Wakefield's characters tend to start their educational journey with very little scientific knowledge, only to learn and develop their skills to a point where they are able to convey their acquired knowledge to another beginner. This is most evident in those texts which adopted the format of a familiar conversation within the entire family as members contribute their own knowledge and thoughts to the discussions. Under these circumstances, the boundary between the teacher and learner is blurred; these books promoted the notion of sharing knowledge among non-elites without one teacher, or one figure, dictating what will be learnt. On the other hand, readers of Marcet are presented with a domestic sphere where the control of the lessons, the experiments and the conversation at hand is clearly delineated. Perhaps this explains why Conversations on Chemistry was favoured by American schools. Unsurprisingly, Edgeworth's philosophy that the curriculum should be tailored to meet the needs of the individual child was hard to maintain in a public school. Pupils had varying degrees of autonomy in their studies within the domestic sphere: some were permitted an active role in their education, while others appear to be more passive. In Marcet's Conversations series, her pupil characters, Emily and Lucy, appear to hang on every word that the knowledgeable Mrs B says. The authoritative Mrs B never leaves, and rarely ceases guiding, her young pupils in their scientific pursuits at home. The children of the Harcourt family in Wakefield's Mental Improvement admit that they prefer conversation with their parents over the instruction of a governess. In Wakefield's depicted domestic sphere, being immersed in enlightening conversation as a family was an educational necessity for children. In contrast, Edgeworth's Harry and Lucy express an interest in learning without excessive interruptions from any authority figures; they are permitted more time to roam the domestic sphere with a degree of autonomy and in solitude while pursuing their scientific studies. In short, domestic settings abounded as spaces for familiar science in this period\u2014but they were as varied as they were many. Towards the middle of the nineteenth century, educational books in the dramatic and novelistic familiar format declined in popularity as they were coded as \u2018feminine\u2019 and tagged as \u2018non-science\u2019. It has been argued that texts such as Lydia Becker's Botany for Novices , published in 1864, gave female readers a much wider field for knowledge, well beyond home and mother, with no geographical or mental restrictions. 107 However, the domestic sphere is not so limiting, or homogeneous, when what it could offer is taken into consideration. Authors presented their readers with domestic spheres that could feature a headstrong mother, sister or governess as a scientific authority; a space to put different teaching methods into practice; and children of both sexes taking an active role in their education by collecting specimens, dissecting plants, using specialist equipment and tools, and carrying out chemical experiments.

Segmented worms (Annelida) are among the most successful animal inhabitants of extreme environments worldwide. An unusual group of enchytraeid oligochaetes of genus Mesenchytraeus are abundant in the Pacific northwestern region of North America and occupy geographically proximal ecozones ranging from low elevation rainforests and waterways to high altitude glaciers. Along this altitudinal transect, Mesenchytraeus representatives from disparate habitat types were collected and subjected to deep mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenetic analyses. Our data identify significant topological discordance among gene trees, and near equivalent interspecific divergence levels indicative of a rapid radiation event. Collectively, our results identify a Mesenchytraeus \u2018explosion\u2019 coincident with mountain building in the Pacific northwestern region that gave rise to closely related aquatic, ice, snow and terrestrial worms.

The load is supported by a combination of the stresses within the sheet (which may include applied tensions from, for example, surface tension) and the hydrostatic pressure in the liquid. At the same time, the sheet deforms, and may wrinkle, because of the load. We study this problem in terms of the (relatively weak) applied tension and the indentation depth. For small indentation depths, we find that the force\u2013indentation curve is linear with a stiffness that we characterize in terms of the applied tension and bending stiffness of the sheet. At larger indentations, the force\u2013indentation curve becomes nonlinear and the sheet is subject to a wrinkling instability. We study this wrinkling instability close to the buckling threshold and calculate both the number of wrinkles at onset and the indentation depth at onset, comparing our theoretical results with experiments. Finally, we contrast our results with those previously reported for very thin, highly bendable membranes. 1. Introduction Poking is a natural way in which to test the material properties of an object, both in everyday life (for example, an under-inflated bicycle tyre) or, more quantitatively, in AFM measurements of graphene [ 1 , 2 ] and biological cells [ 3 ]. While in many situations the object being poked is a homogeneous bulk material, in others the object is a composite, consisting, for example, of a bulk material with a thin coating. In such scenarios, poking may provide information about the coating, the substrate that is coated or some combination of the two. The canonical problem to understand the relative roles of coating and substrate is that of a thin elastic film bonded to a substrate. Perhaps the simplest substrate response is one that provides a restoring force linear in the vertical deflection\u2014a Winkler foundation [ 4 ]. Physically, this corresponds to an object floating on the surface of a liquid: the hydrostatic pressure within the liquid provides a restoring force that is precisely linear in the vertical deflection. However, this linear response is also commonly used as a model of an elastic substrate\u2014this model assumes that the substrate consists of an array of linear springs and is therefore also known as the mattress model. At the same time as being relatively simple to formulate mathematically, this scenario is also of interest at a range of scales: at very large scales, floating ice sheets are often used in cold regions as construction platforms for transport routes, airfields and offshore oil exploration sites. Determining the bearing capacity and failure of ice sheets subject to vertical loads is essential when assessing the operational potential of floating ice sheets [ 5 \u2013 8 ]. This requires knowledge of the bending rigidity of sea ice [ 9 , 10 ], which is usually measured by comparison with theoretical results for the loading of a thin floating plate [ 11 , 12 ]. At still larger scales, the loading of ice sheets by surface melt water has been implicated in the catastrophic collapse of the Larsen B ice sheet in Antarctica [ 13 ], while at global scales the gravitational loading of the lithosphere by mountain ranges [ 14 , 15 ] and volcanic sea mounts [ 16 ] involve much the same physical ingredients. At the other end of the length-scale spectrum, the elastic properties of thin biological materials may be characterized by measuring the deflection that results from an applied central point force [ 17 \u2013 19 ]. Similarly, the material properties of ultra-thin polymer films can be determined from the readily observable wrinkle patterns that form when floating films are subject to a localized force either from the capillary pressure of a fluid droplet or an imposed displacement from an indenter [ 20 \u2013 22 ]. In both cases, a vertical deflection pulls material radially inwards and in so doing generates a compressive azimuthal stress in the film that ultimately results in a radial pattern of wrinkles. The properties of these wrinkling patterns at very small scales have been extensively studied both \u2018near-threshold\u2019 (close to the onset of instability) [ 23 ] and \u2018far-from-threshold\u2019 (once the wrinkling pattern is well developed) [ 21 , 22 , 24 \u2013 26 ]. The key observation is that in highly flexible films, the stress state is qualitatively changed by wrinkling: wrinkling relaxes the stress in the direction perpendicular to the wrinkles [ 24 , 27 , 28 ]. This may have important consequences for the mean shape of the wrinkled object, which is, in general, different from what would be observed in the absence of wrinkles [ 22 , 29 ]. Furthermore, this wrinkling can have the surprising consequence that the force\u2013displacement response depends not on the mechanical properties of the film (its modulus and thickness), but rather only its geometry (e.g. radius) and other physics in the system [ 22 , 29 ]. As well as their aesthetic appeal, these wrinkle patterns are of interest as a means of generating surfaces with functional patterned topology [ 30 ] that may be useful in applications such as wetting [ 31 ] and photonic devices [ 32 ]. Although the large and small length-scale problems discussed above contain the same physical ingredients, the former are dominated by bending stresses and gravity, while the latter are dominated by the surface tension of the interface, together with gravity. Indeed, it is this influence of the liquid surface tension that distinguishes large scales from small scales. The two problems may therefore be thought of as two limits of an elastic sheet floating at the surface of a liquid and subject to a tension at its boundary. Here, we study the relative effects of the sheet\u2019s bending stiffness and the applied (interfacial) tension, focusing, in particular, on the transition between regimes in which one dominates the other. However, we shall also see that a key third ingredient is the amount of imposed deformation. The paper is structured as follows: the detailed mathematical model used to describe this system is discussed in \u00a7 2 . The experimental set-up used to study axisymmetric deformations of the floating sheet is described in \u00a7 3 . In \u00a7 4 , axisymmetric deformations are considered theoretically with the results of numerical and analytical arguments compared with experiments. This section finishes with a discussion of what distinguishes \u2018small\u2019 and \u2018large\u2019 deflections. The onset of wrinkling is detailed in \u00a7 5 , including a linear stability analysis of the axisymmetric state, a description of the experimental technique employed to identify the onset of wrinkling and comparison between experimental results and the linear stability analysis, before conclusions are presented in \u00a7 6 . 2. Theoretical setting We consider an elastic sheet of thickness h , Young\u2019s modulus E and Poisson\u2019s ratio \u03bd , floating on a fluid of density \u03c1 . The sheet is subject to a point-like force F at its centre (shown schematically in figure 1 ) which results in the deformation of the sheet. Provided that deformations occur over a length scale that is large compared to the thickness of the sheet, we may model the resulting elastic deformation using the F\u00f6ppl\u2013von-K\u00e1rm\u00e1n equations, incorporating the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the fluid phase on the elastic sheet. Accordingly, the vertical displacement of the sheet from its neutral floating equilibrium, \u03b6 ( r , \u03b8 ), satisfies the vertical force balance equation [ 22 ] B", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T06:13:24.047+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "469b26fa12ca8ef7975f67522146a365b7b758d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmnElK7x7D7_j2U2s745gGrTK2sJhipU0UYFhmPTuiYpJ88ppkZKihi.fiBPVVbn9ur.jfss3oOTRjlPcv79AYxp", "site_full": "rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org", "site": "royalsocietypublishing.org", "site_section": "http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/rss/current.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences current issue", "title": "Nonlinear mechanics of non-rigid origami: an efficient computational approach", "title_full": "Nonlinear mechanics of non-rigid origami: an efficient computational approach", "published": "2017-10-11T10:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45018, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "469b26fa12ca8ef7975f67522146a365b7b758d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmnElK7x7D7_j2U2s745gGrTK2sJhipU0UYFhmPTuiYpJ88ppkZKihi.fiBPVVbn9ur.jfss3oOTRjlPcv79AYxp", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Liu, K., Paulino, G.

The special geometric arrangement of panels and creases gives rise to unique mechanical properties of origami, such as reconfigurability, making origami designs well suited for tunable structures. Although often being ignored, origami structures exhibit additional soft modes beyond rigid folding due to the flexibility of thin sheets that further influence their behaviour. Actual behaviour of origami structures usually involves significant geometric nonlinearity, which amplifies the influence of additional soft modes. To investigate the nonlinear mechanics of origami structures with deformable panels, we present a structural engineering approach for simulating the nonlinear response of non-rigid origami structures. In this paper, we propose a fully nonlinear, displacement-based implicit formulation for performing static/quasi-static analyses of non-rigid origami structures based on \u2018bar-and-hinge\u2019 models. The formulation itself leads to an efficient and robust numerical implementation. Agreement between real models and numerical simulations demonstrates the ability of the proposed approach to capture key features of origami behaviour.

In this paper, an integrated experimental and analytical approach was used to investigate the compressive resistance of helicoidal fibre structures.

Then, load\u2013displacement curves under monotonic compression tests were collected to measure the compressive strengths of helicoidal fibre composites. Fractographic characterization was performed using an X-ray microtomographer and scanning electron microscope, through which crack propagations in helicoidal structures were illustrated.

Sex-specificity of behavioural genetic architectures has, however, rarely been considered. Moreover, as the expression of genetic (co)variances is often environment-dependent, general inferences on sex-specific genetic architectures require estimates of quantitative genetics parameters under multiple conditions. We measured exploration and aggression in pedigreed populations of southern field crickets ( Gryllus bimaculatus ) raised on either naturally balanced (free-choice) or imbalanced (protein-deprived) diets. For each dietary condition, we measured for each behavioural trait (i) level of sexual dimorphism, (ii) level of sex-specificity of survival selection gradients, (iii) level of sex-specificity of additive genetic variance, and (iv) strength of the cross-sex genetic correlation. We report here evidence for sexual dimorphism in behaviour as well as sex-specificity in the expression of genetic (co)variances as predicted by theory. The additive genetic variances of exploration and aggression were significantly greater in males compared with females. Cross-sex genetic correlations were highly positive for exploration but deviating (significantly) from one for aggression; findings were consistent across dietary treatments. This suggests that genetic architectures characterize the sexually dimorphic focal behaviours across various key environmental conditions in the wild.

The quantity of energy available each year was therefore limited, and economic growth was necessarily constrained. In the Industrial Revolution, energy usage increased massively and output rose accordingly. The energy source continued to be plant photosynthesis, but accumulated over a geological age in the form of coal. This poses a problem for the future. Fossil fuels are a depleting stock, whereas in pre-industrial time the energy source, though limited, was renewed each year. 1. Introduction Major changes in the material culture of societies, and in particular in their ability to sustain larger populations, have been closely associated with changes in the scale and type of energy available to meet human needs for nutrition and to perform work. Like all other animate life on the Earth, people were long dependent primarily upon plant photosynthesis as the ultimate source of the energy they consumed. Plant photosynthesis, by capturing a small fraction of the energy reaching the surface of the Earth in the form of insolation, provided the basis for all animate life, both for herbivores and, higher up the food chain, for carnivores. The annual amount of energy captured by plant photosynthesis, therefore, represented an upper limit to the energy available for any productive activity by human groups. All societies before the Industrial Revolution were subject to this overall constraint, but even in the period before the Industrial Revolution, there were major changes in scale of energy that was secured for human use. As a background to describing the fundamental change that occurred in the Industrial Revolution, it may be helpful to briefly describe the course of change during the long period when the annual round of plant growth secured by photosynthesis remained almost the sole energy source. Initially people competed with other animals for the natural products of the environment in which they lived, and in doing so depended essentially on their muscular strength. The first major change in the energy at man\u2019s disposal came with the discovery of methods to generate and to control fire. Plant photosynthesis had provided food, which both sustained life and made available mechanical energy in the form of human muscle. The control of fire gave access to heat energy. By providing warmth in cold seasons, fire increased the geographical range of human settlement, but perhaps more importantly the development of cooking substantially increased the range of food available for consumption, while at the same time reducing the energy needed to digest it. In parallel, the use of fire made it possible to smelt metal ores. Tin, copper and iron tools allowed the development of new crafts and the further refinement of existing crafts: furthermore, metal weapons changed the balance of power between man and other predators. Deliberate and controlled firing of plant cover could also be used to modify the local vegetation cover for human benefit. It is no accident that fire held great symbolic significance in many early religions: the duty of the priesthood often involved the indefinite preservation of a holy flame [ 1 ]. A second and more radical change in the quantity of energy available for human use took place during the Neolithic food revolution with the development of settled agriculture. Immense areas of fertile land were cleared of their natural vegetation and used exclusively to grow crops for human consumption or to provide fodder for farm animals. Instead of competing with other animals for edible plants and with local predators for the grazing animals that could provide meat, the whole product of enormous tracts of land was reserved exclusively for human use. Populations were able to expand by an order of magnitude. Large permanent settlements became possible; urban societies developed. Political, military and religious elites emerged and created complex administrative structures. There were parallel cultural changes, notably the development of writing, with its profound importance for many aspects of individual and community life. The changes that took place in the wake of the Neolithic food revolution were immense, but the bulk of the population remained poor by standards that have since become normal in industrialized societies. The opportunities for economic growth in pre-industrial societies remained severely constrained by energy supply. The quantity of energy reaching the surface of the Earth from the Sun each year is huge, but plant photosynthesis characteristically captures only between 0.1 and 0.4 per cent of this total. As an example, the energy brought by insolation to the surface of Britain each year has been estimated as equivalent to the energy contained in 20 billion tonnes of coal, but because of the limited capture of this total inherent to the nature of plant photosynthesis, the maximum energy that could be secured by an economy subject to this restriction sets severe limits to productive possibilities [ 2 , pp. 2, 12; 3 , p. 2]). One-tenth of 1 per cent of 20 billions is only 20 million tonnes, approximately one-fifteenth of the coal-equivalent energy use figure in Britain today. 2. Organic economies All economies before the Industrial Revolution may be described as organic economies; organic because they operated under the constraints imposed by the annual amount of insolation and the process of photosynthesis in plants. In organic economies, the growth horizon was limited because the scale of energy supply that was accessible represented a severe constraint upon prolonged growth. Those living in organic economies were well aware of the limitations associated with organic economies. A poor harvest, for example, was the signal for a difficult year ahead. If the harvest was sufficiently bad, the poorest sections of the population might well face severe malnutrition, even starvation. In considering the nature of organic economies, it is illuminating to consider the views of the classical economists: they displayed a clear understanding of their nature. They were writing in the period often designated as the era of the Industrial Revolution, the last decades of the eighteenth century and the opening decades of the nineteenth, but their views were formed by their understanding of the world before it began to be transformed by the Industrial Revolution. Despite their advocacy of the benefits of a market economy in promoting growth and increasing the efficiency with which capital and labour were employed, Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus (the three most eminent of the classical economists) were adamant that growth must be limited and that the end state following a period of growth might well be as miserable as the situation prevailing at its beginning [ 4 ]. They used a different explanatory framework to bring home the problem that I have described in terms of energy. They focused on the fact that the area of land suitable for farming use was limited and could not be significantly increased. The classical economists identified three basic requirements for production to take place: it must involve capital, labour and land. Supplies of the first two factors of production could, in principle, be extended indefinitely, but the supply of land was fixed by the geography of the globe. All the food and virtually all the raw materials used in material production were produced by agriculture. The scale of any potential increase in the supply of wool, leather, wood and a host of similar raw materials was necessarily limited by the productivity of the land. Equally, the output of metals was similarly limited, as it required an abundant supply of heat to smelt mineral ores, and wood and charcoal were the source of the heat in question. If any form of material production was to be increased, more production must be secured from the land. Yet, since the most productive land was settled first, this meant either taking into cultivation land of inferior quality or using existing land more intensively, or some combination of the two. This in turn implied decreasing returns to capital and labour. At some point, growth would therefore come to a halt. The very nature of growth, because it involved achieving an increased output from the land, a production factor that could not be expanded to match, ensured that it must first decelerate and later cease. As Smith remarked [ 5 , I, p. 106]: In a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which the nature of its soil and climate, and its situation with respect to other countries, allowed it to acquire; which could, therefore, advance no further, and which was not going backwards, both the wages of labour and the profits of stock would probably be very low. Reviewing the same problem 40 years later Ricardo came to the same gloomy conclusion, adding that \u2018This [a state of affairs in which both capital and labour would enjoy very poor returns] will necessarily be rendered permanent by the laws of nature, which have limited the productive powers of the land\u2019 [ 6 , pp. 125\u2013126]. Malthus supplied an additional consideration, which reinforced the gloomy conclusion to be drawn from the nature of all organic economies. Drawing upon the knowledge acquired as an undergraduate in Cambridge studying mathematics, he made use of the distinction between the nature of arithmetic and geometric progressions. He suggested that, even on the most optimistic of assumptions, output from the land could not be expected to rise faster than in arithmetic progression. Population, on the other hand, unless checked, would rise in geometric progression. At some point, this must cause pressure on living standards, as numbers approached a ceiling set by land productivity, with depressing implications for living standards [ 7 , pp. 8\u201310]. Growth, therefore, in the eyes of the classical economists, was necessarily asymptotic. The very nature of the growth process resulted in due course in its deceleration and eventual cessation. The modern conviction that economic growth is normally exponential would have been regarded as somewhat fantastic to those living in organic economies. It is therefore not surprising that it took time for the nature of the new age to become apparent to contemporaries. It is testimony to the difficulty that contemporaries experienced in recognizing the implications of the changes in train during the Industrial Revolution that, as late as the middle decades of the nineteenth century, John Stuart Mill [ 8 , I, p. 182], in re-examining the issue of sustained growth, felt that the pessimism of the classical economists was justified, though recognizing that it was conceivable that the traditional barriers to growth might be overcome. It was not until the final third of the nineteenth century that the nature of the new world that had come into existence was widely appreciated, and the term \u2018Industrial Revolution\u2019 became widely used. Karl Marx\u2019s anger at the capitalist system stemmed from a recognition that a new era had begun, that exponential growth was taking place but that the benefit of the new ability to create wealth was benefiting only a tiny minority. In the event, the pessimism of the classical economists proved unfounded, though their logic was impeccable. They analysed the problem in relation to the fixed supply of land. I have done the same while expressing the problem in energy terms. This is convenient because it points to the change that provided an escape from the constraints that had previously limited growth. Production in organic economies was limited by the supply of energy captured by the annual cycle of plant photosynthesis. Paradoxically, plant photosynthesis continued to be the dominant source of energy in the new era, conventionally termed the Industrial Revolution, but it was the energy drawn from many millions of years of plant photosynthesis in the form of coal, rather than the limited product of a single year, that had for so long set the ceiling to energy availability. At much the same time as Marx advanced one view of the new situation brought about by the Industrial Revolution, William Jevons [ 9 , p. 2] wrote extensively about what he termed \u2018the coal question\u2019. He was in no doubt that it was the use of coal that had ended what he termed the \u2018laborious poverty of early times\u2019. 3. The significance of exploiting a new source of energy Given the nature of organic economies, indeed, it might be argued that the key question regarding the Industrial Revolution is not how it first gathered momentum but why it did not grind to a halt in the manner forecast by the classical economists. Periods of increasing prosperity and economic sophistication had occurred previously but had lost rather than gained momentum because pressure on the land inevitably increased as production rose. When Sir Thomas More in Tudor times complained that the sheep were eating up the men, he was drawing attention in a thought-provoking manner to the inescapable problems of organic economies. He wrote \u2018your sheep that were wont to be so meek and tame and so small eaters, now, as I hear say, be become so great devourers and so wild, that they eat up and swallow down the very men themselves\u2019 [ 10 , p. 26]. If the woollen industry was flourishing and the demand for wool therefore rising, more land might be devoted to sheep pasture, but this must mean less land available to grow corn for human consumption, or less land under forest, which must at some point create difficulties for the production of charcoal for iron production. It is simple to demonstrate how seriously dependence upon the produce of the land limited output. Iron and steel were critical to the progress made during the Industrial Revolution, yet if half the land surface of Britain had been covered with woodland, it would only have sufficed to produce the charcoal needed to smelt perhaps million tonnes of bar iron on a sustained yield basis [ 11 , p. 16]. The creation of a national rail network, for example, would have been physically impossible without the transition to fossil fuels as the principal energy source because of the quantity of iron and steel needed for rails, engines and rolling stock. To make the same point in a different way, one might say that, to make it possible for an industrial revolution to take place, not one but two capitalisms were needed. The development of a market economy, a capitalist economy, such as that achieved in The Netherlands in their \u2018golden age\u2019 in the seventeenth century, can give rise to higher levels of output per head but cannot in itself produce an industrial revolution. For that to occur, a second kind of capital proved necessary. Gaining access to a capital stock of energy built up over a geological era was also essential, since it meant that energy could be expended on a scale that was not otherwise available. Mediaeval philosophers distinguished between what they termed fungibles and consumptibles . A field was fungible because its use in any one year did not prevent using it for the same purpose in the next. A loaf of bread was a consumptible, because after it had been consumed its use was ended. This distinction clarifies an important difference between organic economies and an economy based on fossil fuels, which emerged first in Britain. The supply of energy in organic economies was fungible in nature. The use of the product of plant photosynthesis in any one year did not affect its availability in the following year. Fossil fuels, in contrast, are consumptibles. Each tonne of coal burnt slightly reduces the stock left to be burnt in the future. Unless industrial societies can find ways of returning to dependence on fungible sources of energy, in the long run they will face very serious, even disastrous, problems, whose nature is quite different from the problems faced by organic societies in the past. 4. The contrast between England and continental Europe In recent years, it has become possible to track the changing balance of the several major sources of energy in a number of European countries because of the work of a group of like-minded scholars. 1 They agreed on a common method of measurement and common definitions of energy sources. In the case of England, this can be done from the sixteenth century onwards. I turn now, therefore, to a description of the course of change in energy supply in England over a period of more than three centuries. Table 1 summarizes the course of change over these three centuries. Energy consumption increased in absolute terms in all the categories employed, with the exception of firewood. The increases were substantial in all the other categories, but, whereas coal was a minor player in the mid-sixteenth century compared with draught animals, firewood and people, by the mid-nineteenth century it dwarfed all the other categories combined.

We discovered a single female of Drosophila biauraria, collected from Tomakomai, Hokkaido, Japan, that produced all-female offspring. This all-female trait was maternally inherited in the iso-female line (SP12F) by backcrossing with males of a normal line (SP11-20) with a 1 : 1 sex ratio derived from the same population. The all-female trait was not affected by tetracycline treatment performed for two consecutive generations. However, the microinjection of filter-sterilized homogenate of SP12F females into SP11-20 females established all-female matrilines. Our data suggest the role of transmissible agents, most likely viruses, but not bacteria or protists, as the possible cause of the all-female phenotype, which is likely to be achieved by killing of male embryos because egg hatch rates of SP12F were nearly half those of SP11-20. This is the first report in Diptera to demonstrate a maternally inherited virus-like element as the cause of the male-killing phenotype in D. biauraria .

The FPR model is based on a coupled system of Fokker\u2013Planck equations wherein the distribution of each island type is governed by its own Fokker\u2013Planck equation for growth, with reaction terms describing the shape transitions between islands of different types including asymmetric shapes. The reaction terms for the shape transitions depend on the island size and are determined from explicit calculations of the lowest barrier pathway for each shape transition. This mean-field model enables us to consider the kinetics of asymmetric shape transitions and study the evolution of island shape distributions during the coupled growth and transition process. Asymmetric metastable shapes play a crucial role in the dynamics, with asymmetric QDs comprising up to 10% of the population, and with up to 100% of the shape transitions passing through asymmetric shapes. Moreover, we find that the characteristic multimodal distribution of pyramid/dome QD coarsening can be eliminated at sufficiently high temperature and deposition rate.

However, the existence of a clear anatomical asymmetry providing an initial imbalance for normal neural development is still not understood. Using a so-called foveascope, we found that for a cohort of 30 normal adults, the two blue cone-free areas at the centre of the foveas are asymmetrical. The noise-stimulated afterimage dominant eye introduced here corresponds to the circular blue cone-free area, while the non-dominant eye corresponds to the diffuse and irregular elliptical outline. By contrast, we found that this asymmetry is absent or frustrated in a similar cohort of 30 adults with normal ocular status, but with dyslexia, i.e. with visual and phonological deficits. In this case, our results show that the two Maxwell centroid outlines are both circular but lead to an undetermined afterimage dominance with a coexistence of primary and mirror images. The interplay between the lack of asymmetry and the development in the neural maturation of the brain pathways suggests new implications in both fundamental and biomedical sciences.

Opinion is divided as to whether birds competitively displaced pterosaurs from small-body size niches or whether the two groups coexisted with little competition. Previous studies of Mesozoic birds and pterosaurs compared measurements of homologous limb bones to test these hypotheses. However, these characters probably reflect differing ancestries rather than ecologies. Here, competition and ecological separation were tested for using multivariate analyses of functionally equivalent morphological characters. As well as using characters from the fore- and hindlimbs, these analyses also included measurements of the lower jaw. The results of this study indicate that pterosaurs had relatively longer jaws, shorter metatarsals and shorter brachial regions compared with birds of similar size. Contrary to the results of previous studies, the distal wing was not important for separating the two clades in morphospace owing to the inclusion of the primary feathers in this unit. The differences found here indicate ecological separation based on differences in size, locomotory features and feeding adaptations. Thus, instead of one group displacing the other, birds and pterosaurs appear to have adopted distinctive ecological strategies throughout their period of coexistence.

Conceptual model for the relationship between natural capital, ecosystem services and humans. The natural capital sustains the provision of ecosystem services. Different species, and humans in particular, can display different adaptive strategies to use available ecosystem services (depicted as geometric shapes within the space of ecosystem services). These strategies imply a particular interaction between demography (i.e. population size), technology production through innovation and ideology. These strategies redirect, through technological innovations, different proportions of the flow of ecosystem services to their own maintenance and growth, which is expressed by the size of the geometric shape in the space of ecosystem services. The framework presented in figure 1 is rooted in simple biological reasoning; the persistence of humans, as any other species, is possible by the services provided by the ecosystem they inhabit, and whose flow affects their fitness. Human persistence is driven by continuous trial and error at the individual level, and by transmission through social learning and the persistence of innovations at the social level, and manifested in biological and technological evolution [ 31 ]. The flow of ecosystem services is sustained by the natural capital or stock of natural assets (soil, water, minerals, air and living entities) [ 27 ] and, for this reason, they are shown as embedded within the natural capital space in figure 1 . Different species, and humans in particular, can display different adaptive strategies to use available ecosystem services (depicted as geometric shapes within the space of ecosystem services). These strategies imply a particular interaction between demography (i.e. population size), technology production through innovation and ideology. This latter component provides the narrative that sustains, and socially validates, the particular feedback between demography and technology associated with a given strategy. These adaptive strategies, or lifestyles, redirect through technological innovations different proportions of the flow of ecosystem services to their own maintenance and growth, which are expressed by the size of the geometric shape in the space of ecosystem services in figure 1 . Using this conceptual model, we analyse the sustainability of our modern lifestyle and ask under what circumstances the maximization of our standards of well-being, propelled through increasing population size and increasing innovation (e.g. [ 10 ]), is feasible without compromising our survival and the environment. 2. General model As a point of departure, we use the model proposed by Keymer et al. [ 32 ] (see equations (2.1)\u2013(2.4)) below) to understand the dynamics of bacterial diversity and modify it according to the framework introduced in figure 1 . These authors assume that any species is confined to a finite habitat, which in the case of humans is planet Earth. The finiteness of habitable habitat sets a limit to how much biomass can be packed inside it. We define \u03d5 as the proportion of human biomass in relation to the maximum that can be sustained on the planet. The dynamics of this human biomass can then be expressed as: 2.1 The logistic term on the right-hand side of equation (2.1) represents the spatial density dependence induced by the finiteness of the habitat. We make the per capita population growth rate ( r ) a function of \u2018habitat quality\u2019 ( \u03c9 ), which is a measure of the state of all ecosystem services required by humans and whose value is a function of the flow of those services [ 28 ]. Habitat quality affects r by modifying the fecundity and mortality of the population inhabiting it; therefore, we decompose r into its per capita birth ( b ) and death ( d ) rate components. Let us assume that there is a fixed level of mortality ( d 0 ), which is biologically determined and would occur even in an optimal environment. Now assume that in addition, there is a mortality ( d ) that depends on the quality of the habitat as d (1 \u2212 \u03c9 ), and thus tends to 0 when the quality of the habitat tends to 1. This implies which is equivalent to Making ( b + d ) = f and ( d + d 0 ) = m , we arrive at 2.2 where f is the maximal fecundity rate that the species can achieve under ideal conditions, which is weighted by the habitat quality ( \u03c9 ). Mortality m , on the other hand, includes both a biologically determined rate (assumed fixed) and a habitat-dependent rate that varies according to habitat quality. When habitat quality, , takes on the value of 1, the flux of all ecosystem services is at the maximal capacity for human use. We model the habitat quality dynamics by considering that quality increases as the supply of ecosystem services in the habitat ( \u03bb ) increases. Habitat quality decreases owing to the consumption of ecosystem services by the human population and is a function of maintenance needs ( B ) and the efficiency ( E ) with which an individual converts them, or uses them, to support offspring. Thus, the expression for habitat quality dynamics is as follows: 2.3 The first term on the right-hand side of equation (2.3) corresponds to the supply of ecosystem services affected by human actions in the habitat. The second term is ecosystem service consumption and/or use to fuel human population maintenance and growth. The system of coupled equations can then be written as: 2.4 This system has been studied by Keymer et al. [ 32 ] (see also [ 33 ]), with three known possible long-term behaviours, which in its current version correspond to: (1) the extinction equilibrium. Here, the human population goes extinct ( \u03d5 * = 0) and the habitat quality, or flow of ecosystem services that sustain the human niche, stays at its maximal state ( \u03c9 * = 1). (2) The Habitat Limitation equilibrium. This equilibrium is set by the balance between the consumption and supply of ecosystem services within the habitat, which reaches equilibrium at \u03c9 * = m / f , sustaining a population whose equilibrium biomass is given by . And, (3) the Space Limitation equilibrium. Here, the equilibrium is reached when the species fills the entire space with biomass \u03d5 * = 1, and habitat quality stays as which, in the human case, improves as humans decrease their maintenance needs ( B ) and increase the efficiency in converting ecosystem services to support offspring ( E ). The stability of the previous fixed points is provided in the electronic supplementary material. With this model in hand, we evaluate how can it be used to explain the modern increase in human population numbers and ask about the sustainability of the process. We make the hypothesis that the human capacity for \u2018CCE\u2019 allows continuous improvement, through innovation, in the availability and flow of ecosystem services and therefore the maintenance of high habitat quality which ultimately allows higher population numbers to be reached (e.g. [ 34 ]). 3. Including innovation into the model The ecosystem services replenishment rate ( \u03bb ) is a key parameter in our general model, as it determines the final biomass that humans can attain under Habitat Limitation and, if great enough (i.e. \u03bb > \u03bb *), the final state of all ecosystem services or habitat quality that will support human biomass at planetary saturation (see the electronic supplementary material). Along these lines, it would always pay to invest in innovations that increase the replenishment rate of ecosystem services (higher \u03bb ). However, innovations necessarily entail costs [ 13 , 14 , 35 , 36 ], which need to be incorporated in the general model. The next sections discuss these processes and how they should be incorporated in the general model. 4. Cumulative cultural evolution as process in technological development One definitive characteristic of humans is their enhanced capacity for cultural dynamics (e.g. [ 37 ]). Culture is defined as \u2018information [\u2026] acquired from other conspecifics by teaching or imitation\u2019 [ 38 ], and although what corresponds to culture is present in a number of species, humans are unique in their capacity to acquire and retain new cultural traits over generations and devise technologies that no single individual could invent [ 19 , 22 , 39 ]. This capacity of CCE allows continuous change or innovation of cultural features, generating extremely complex traits through time [ 21 , 22 , 40 ]. In our model, we are particularly interested in those cultural innovations that allow improvement of the flow of ecosystem services, which we will address as \u2018Technology\u2019 ( \u03bc ). Defining technology is not an easy task, and it can be considered to encompass anything that is required to produce an \u2018object of material culture\u2019 that \u2018fulfils a human purpose\u2019 [ 41 ]. In the context of the current model, and for the sake of simplicity, we will consider technology as any cultural device, tangible or not, that is the product of innovation driven by CCE and whose direct effect is to increase the supply of one or more ecosystem services. This includes the knowledge base as well as the institutions that influence the effectiveness with which this knowledge is used [ 11 ]. A vast amount of literature analyses the processes behind technological/cultural innovation (e.g. [ 20 , 21 , 25 , 30 , 41 \u2013 44 ]) and, although no complete consensus or an articulated theory exists [ 41 ], some principles of this process are well established. When modelling technological innovations, it is clear that: (i) a positive feedback exists with population size (e.g. [ 24 , 25 , 45 \u2013 49 ]), because not only does having more individuals increase the chances that someone will come up with an invention, but also population size increases the rate of human interaction and social learning, and thus per capita invention probability and the production of complex innovations [ 24 , 25 , 30 , 31 , 42 , 44 , 46 , 50 ]. This is further augmented by the progressive trend in urban aggregation exhibited by our species [ 51 ]. (ii) There is a positive feedback with technological accumulation, because extant technologies can, through recombination, result in new technologies [ 21 , 31 , 41 , 52 , 53 ]. And (iii) CCE is the main mechanism for technological innovation, through the transmission, modification and persistence of socially learnt technologies. We suggest that at least some, if not all these processes, must be present when modelling innovations. Considering the above, it becomes clear that the rate of ecosystem service provision should be a function of the technological stock aimed at improving its flow. This implies that \u03bb in equation (2.4) should be \u03bb ( \u03bc ). Furthermore, based on the study of Enquist et al. [ 21 ], we can model the dynamics of technological stock as follows: 4.1 Here, the first term on the right side of equation (4.1) addresses invention mechanisms that produce new technological innovations through CCE, which depends on \u03d5 , and the impact of a per capita innovation rate \u03c1 , which is modelled as a self-reinforcement process that is a function of the already accumulated technological stock \u03bc . The second part of the right-hand side includes a rate of technology loss ( l ) due to chance events and/or technology deterioration over time. Finally, there is a minimum or basic technological toolkit ( \u025b ) associated with some basic knowledge and abilities (e.g. ability to find and gather water or food, to communicate, measure and calculate) that identify either a state characterizing early human societies or some other minimum technological toolkit to which humans have access. 5. Costs underlying technologically complex societies The costs of technological innovation are associated with the conditions that foster their emergence such as large population size, usually in dense urban centres with augmented risks of epidemic outbreaks, increased waste production, pollution and violence, among others [ 54 \u2013 56 ]. Urban centres are also loci for increased demand for ecosystem services [ 34 ] that result in environmental problems that can reach global extent (e.g. Global Change, [ 57 ]). While these costs could be abated through the creation and maintenance of social and physical infrastructure [ 44 ], it is unlikely that they will disappear, as the maintenance of such infrastructure necessarily increases the demands of individuals living in those settlements, as suggested by empirical data [ 13 , 14 , 34 , 36 , 58 , 59 ]. This, in our framework, translates into greater impacts upon the service provided by ecosystems. To introduce this cost into the general model, we assume that the per capita maintenance requirements of human biomass are an increasing function of the accumulated technological stock. The logic behind this is that maintenance needs ( B ) increase owing to the added social costs of technological development B s ( \u03bc ), defined as the additional resources required by individuals to engage in fruitful teaching/learning dynamics, and thus innovation, in a given cultural group; hence . Furthermore, because (e.g. social costs are significantly greater than maintenance needs, see [ 34 ]), then , so we ignore the term Ef\u03c9 shown in equation (2.4). Finally, we need to specify suitable functions for \u03bb ( \u03bc ) and B ( \u03bc ). Since technological development, innovation activity, inventions and ideas scale with population size (e.g. [ 8 ]), we assume that the increase in the technologically driven provision of supporting ecosystem services, and associated costs, scales with the amount of technological stock \u03bc . Empirical evidence indicates that this may be a reasonable assumption. Figure 2 shows that the provision and the costs of primary energy increase with two proxies of innovation and technological development. Thus, we define both functions as simple scaling relationships of the form and , respectively, with normalization constants c 1 and c 2 . After these considerations, we can now define the complete model, which links human biomass to habitat quality (i.e. the state of ecosystem services in the habitat) and then to technological innovations that increase the provision of the ecosystem services.

Phenotypic information associated with new transcription factor binding. Data are based on experimentally measured binding of 187 mouse transcription factors to all possible DNA-binding sites of length eight [ 30 , 31 , 55 ]. ( a ) Histogram of the information content of the DNA-binding phenotype of each transcription factor (definition 2.1 and equation (2.1)). ( b ) The gain in information content associated with acquisition of a new DNA-binding phenotype, when an old phenotype is simultaneously preserved (equation (2.2)). The inset shows this gain in information content (vertical axis) as a function of the information content of the old phenotype (horizontal axis). Circles correspond to means, boxes to standard errors and whiskers indicate 95% confidence intervals. Data in ( b ) are based on all 29290 pairs of transcription factors whose sets of binding sites overlap. ( c ) The change in information content associated with acquisition of a new DNA-binding phenotype when the old phenotype need not be simultaneously preserved (equation (2.4)). The red line indicates the fit to a Gaussian distribution. Data in ( c ) are based on all 187 2 pairs of transcription factors in the dataset. If a site gets duplicated, such that the two duplicates evolve separately, and only one of them needs to preserve regulator binding, the change in phenotypic information content as a result of duplication lies between \u22120.34 and \u22120.64 bits per nucleotide (equation (2.3), with data from figure 2 a , where 0.0016 < f P < 0.045), meaning that 44.4\u20131250 times more genotypes can be explored. In reality, duplication will confer an even greater advantage, because often entire regulatory regions and not just individual binding sites are duplicated. When a binding site for a new regulator originates from one for an old regulator, and if binding of the old regulator is preserved (for example, because the old regulator directs essential gene expression in a different tissue), then phenotypic information increases (definition 2.2; figure 2 b ). For the 187 regulators considered here, the minimal increase is 0.04 bits when a binding site for factor Myb originates from one for factor Mybl1, because these regulators belong to the same gene family, and 97.2% of the 1969 sites bound by Mybl1 are also bound by Myb. The largest increase (11.5 bits) occurs when binding sites for transcription factor Mnt emerge from those for Sp110, because Sp110 binds to 2933 sites, but only one of them is also bound by Mnt. The complexity increase is generally lower if the old site had high information content (Spearman's r = \u22120.22; p < 10 \u221217 ; n = 29 290; figure 2 b , inset), which shows that phenotypic information changes can depend on ancestral phenotypes and are thus contingent on evolutionary history. If binding to an old transcriptional regulator need not be preserved after a new binding phenotype originates, then the distribution of information change is symmetric ( figure 2 c ), because for every value of information change X that occurs when binding is gained by some new regulator Y and lost by an old regulator Z, there is an opposite value \u2013X when binding by Z is gained and binding by Y is lost. The maximal information loss or gain is 4.83 bits (Sp110-binding originating from Usf1-binding). Its minimum is zero for regulator pairs (e.g. Hbp1 and Rfx4) that bind the same number of sites. (b) Metabolic genotypes and phenotypes The metabolic genotype of an organism comprises all genes encoding metabolic enzymes. Systems biologists often represent this genotype more compactly, on the level of metabolic reactions these enzymes catalyse, by the presence or absence of specific reactions from a known \u2018universe\u2019 of such reactions [ 60 , 61 ] (electronic supplementary material, figure S3a). Such a genotype encodes a biochemical reaction network that transforms environmental nutrients into essential biomass molecules, such as amino acids and nucleotides. A metabolic genotype is viable only if it can produce all biomass molecules that an organism needs in a given nutrient environment. One can compute viability for any known genotype under some simplifying assumptions [ 60 ], and these predictions are often in good agreement with experimental observations [ 61 \u2013 64 ]. The metabolic genotypes of free-living organism like Escherichia coli are members of a vast genotype space that can only be explored by sampling. I restrict myself here to a much smaller universe of 45 metabolic reactions from central carbon metabolism, which gives rise to a more tractable genotype space [ 39 ] (electronic supplementary material, figure S2). Given the right nutrients, the biochemical network encoded by these reactions can manufacture 13 essential biomass precursors, such as ribose 5-phosphate and oxaloacetate (electronic supplementary material, figure S2). The metabolic genotype space I explore is formed by all possible (2 45 ) subsets of these reactions. I consider 10 minimal chemical environments that differ only in the sole carbon source they contain (electronic supplementary material, figure S3b) and represent a metabolic phenotype as the combination of carbon sources on which a metabolism is viable (electronic supplementary material, figure S3b,c). Considering all possible combinations of 10 carbon sources on which a metabolism could be viable, this leads to 2 10 possible metabolic phenotypes. In an earlier contribution, we have exhaustively computed these metabolic phenotypes for all 2 45 \u2248 10 13 metabolic genotypes [ 39 ], which allows me to analyse their phenotypic information content. Some phenotypes contain much less information than others, e.g. viability on fructose and glucose requires 14.8 bits of information, whereas viability on all 10 carbon sources except glutamate and \u03b1-ketoglutarate requires 28.6 bits. Starting from a metabolic phenotype, viability on an additional carbon source requires an average of 0.75 additional bits (electronic supplementary material, figure S3d, inset). Neglecting non-additive interactions among reactions underestimates phenotypic information (electronic supplementary material, figures S3e and S4d), and duplication causes a substantial reduction in information by up to 29 bits (electronic supplementary material, Results S4). The distribution of information gain and information change are broad (electronic supplementary material, figure S3f,g and Results S4\u2013S6). Gaining viability on given carbon sources can be informationally cheap (e.g. \u03b1-ketoglutarate) or expensive (acetate). Perhaps surprisingly, gaining viability on some carbon sources may lead to reduced phenotypic information, as a result of complex correlations between phenotypes (electronic supplementary material, Results S4). (c) Inferring information content from sequence data Tractable genotype spaces like those I have discussed so far are the exception. Usually, astronomically many genotypes encode the same phenotype, and because it is impossible to identify all of them, one cannot infer the information content of any one phenotype (definition 2.1). What is more, sequencing technology does not simply enumerate genotypes but samples them from an evolving population. I will argue next that it may nonetheless be possible to estimate the information change associated with a novel phenotype (definition 2.2). In doing so, I make simplifying assumptions whose relaxation will require future work. My main point is that quantifying phenotypic information change may be within reach of current technologies. Consider two populations of which one is well adapted to some ancestral environment (with phenotype P Old ) and another one is adapted to a new environment, such as one that harbours a novel nutrient, an antibiotic or another stressor, and thus requires an altered phenotype P New . I assume that both populations comprise asexually reproducing haploid individuals, that they are in mutation\u2013selection\u2013drift balance subject to Wright-Fisher dynamics [ 65 ] and that they have equal effective sizes N e and mutation rates \u03bc (per genome and generation). I also assume that both phenotypes P Old and P New are subject to strong truncation selection, that is, mutations that disrupt each phenotype are lethal. The two phenotypes may differ in their numbers of associated genotypes G Old and G New , and thus also in their information content. The task is to estimate this difference () from two samples of n genotypes (DNA sequences), one from each of the populations. I model this difference as a difference in the average rate of strongly deleterious (lethal) mutations across all genotypes or, equivalently, in the average rate of neutral mutations. If l Old and l New denote the average proportion of all strongly deleterious (lethal) mutations in the two populations, then the average neutral mutation rate becomes and . Assuming further that mutations in all viable genotypes are equally likely to be strongly deleterious, one obtains the relationships and is the total size of genotype space. It is then easy to see that 2.4 Thus, estimating the difference in phenotypic information content requires estimating the quantities , which are of broad importance in population genetics because they predict a population's amount of neutral polymorphisms [ 65 , 66 ]. If P New harbours more information than , then , and the population with P New would harbour more alleles. I emphasize that the derivation of equation (2.4) involves a strong tacit assumption, namely that the phenotypic effects of mutants are distributed as if mutations sampled genotypes at random from genotype space. This assumption is violated whenever mutant phenotypes are correlated with those of the wild type, or if some DNA sites are always neutral. It remains to be seen whether relaxation of this assumption leads to relationships as simple as that of (2.4). A maximum-likelihood estimator of \u03b8 i is the number of different genotypes k i in a random sample of n genotypes sequenced from the populations [ 67 ]. Importantly, the sampling distribution of k i is known, and it can help infer the minimal difference in information content detectable from a sample of n sequences (electronic supplementary material). Specifically, one can compute the probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis that phenotype P New harbours more information than P Old .

Data in ( a ) and ( b ) from Miller et al . [ 43 ]. In summary, there is little conceptual justification for requiring that key innovations must lead to rapid speciation or that they should lead to more total speciation, relative to their sister clade. However, innovations should involve a decoupling of speciation\u2013extinction dynamics relative to other lineages in the ancestral adaptive zone, which may or may not be monophyletic ( figure 1 ). Moreover, they should ultimately increase the total species richness of the parent clade. My arguments here should not be construed to imply that variation in lineage diversification rates is not inherently interesting in its own right; I am simply advocating a definition of key innovations that does not require differential diversification rates. 4. Phylogenetic tests of the key innovation hypothesis Testing key innovation hypotheses is challenging, a point that has been appreciated for some time [ 10 , 11 , 31 ]. The definition of key innovation given above offers some level of conceptual clarity but loses the operational elegance of formal tests for trait-dependent diversification. It is relatively straightforward to test some components of the key innovation hypothesis, particularly the idea that specific traits are correlated with (if not causally related to) expansions of the ecological space occupied by a clade. On the other hand, key innovations are assumed to facilitate diversification within a novel adaptive zone, and this proposition is much more difficult to test. Reconstructing diversity dynamics from phylogenetic trees will likely remain difficult into the foreseeable future, owing in part to the relatively low information content of phylogenetic data (next section). Several criteria can help determine whether a key innovation has shaped macroevolutionary patterns in a particular clade. There are two aspects to this test: first, do patterns of ecological and lineage diversification suggest that a shift in adaptive zone has occurred? And second, does a particular trait or set of traits underlie this transition? It may be easier to demonstrate that a clade has shifted to a new adaptive zone than to pin down any particular trait as a key innovation, given that the focal clade is presumably characterized by multiple functionally linked traits that might collectively facilitate a novel pattern of resource use [ 44 ]. Several aspects of terminology should be clarified. Soon after the origin of a key innovation, the ancestral adaptive zone is expected to be paraphyletic ( figure 1 , t 2 ). I use the phrase \u2018parent grade\u2019 to refer to this paraphyletic assemblage of taxa that remain in the ancestral adaptive zone and \u2018parent clade\u2019 to denote the clade comprising both the focal clade (with key innovation) and all lineages in the ancestral adaptive zone. First, a subclade should be characterized by either a major shift in ecological position or an increase in ecological dispersion relative to the ancestral ecological condition. The effect of this shift should be to increase substantially the total ecological volume occupied by the parent clade. From a statistical perspective, the dynamics of ecological or ecomorphological evolution in the focal clade, or along its stem lineage, should be fundamentally different from the \u2018background\u2019 dynamics in the parent grade. Numerous statistical tools are available for identifying discrete shifts in the tempo and mode of phenotypic evolution, including reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that can identify key transitions between distinct evolutionary processes on phylogenies without requiring researchers to fix the possible locations of such transitions in advance [ 45 , 46 ]. By using formal models to identify shifts in the rate of ecological trait evolution or \u2018jumps\u2019 in ecological/morphological space [ 47 \u2013 49 ], researchers can test and reject simple alternative explanations for the observed pattern, such as the hypothesis that the ecological volume occupied by a subclade simply reflects greater time to accumulate differences relative to other lineages. Note that this criterion does not necessarily require that the clade with the innovation have greater disparity or phenotypic rates relative to the parent grade, but that the clade's position is substantially displaced in ecological space. Second, there should be some evidence that a particular trait, or a complex of traits, underlies the shift in question and that the trait(s) facilitate an increase in the total resource spectrum used by the parent clade [ 14 , 15 ]. Implicit in this criterion is that biogeography can be rejected as a cause for the pattern: a shift in ecological trait evolution should not simply reflect dispersal to a biogeographic region with sufficient ecological opportunity to trigger adaptive radiation, but rather should be consistent with the effects of an intrinsic trait. It is not necessary that putative key innovations increase resource use directly: elaboration of anti-herbivore defense syndromes in plants, for example, may indirectly allow them to occupy a broader range of ecological niches by increasing their overall population sizes [ 50 ]. Some have suggested that the novel trait should confer a functional advantage on the lineages bearing the trait relative to the ancestral condition [ 14 ], but I consider this assertion to be generally untestable. Consider Miller's [ 2 ] original example of a key innovation: the evolution of a large bill in Toxostoma thrashers that facilitated a shift in foraging ecology. Do long-billed thrashers that forage by digging and probing through the substrate have a functional advantage relative to closely related mockingbirds with shorter bills that often pounce on food items from aerial perches and which rarely dig? Presumably, the thrasher morphology confers a functional advantage when digging and probing, but both the thrasher and mockingbird morphologies may be equally adaptive in an absolute sense as deployed in their respective foraging strategies. As a third criterion, evidence should support a shift in the diversification dynamics of the clade with the putative key innovation relative to the parent grade/clade. In line with the proposed definition of a key innovation, we would ideally be able to test whether the trait has increased the total species richness of the parent clade relative to the expected clade richness in the absence of the key innovation, but this expectation is difficult or impossible to test in practice. However, a shift to a novel adaptive zone should lead to a decoupling between the evolutionary dynamics of the clade with the putative key innovation and those of the parent grade. Several statistical tools are available for inferring a decoupling of diversification dynamics on phylogenies [ 26 , 45 , 51 ]. Conceptually, Etienne & Haegeman's [ 26 ] model is closest to the formal definition of key innovation given above because it explicitly models diversification dynamics as a mixture of two distinct diversity-dependent processes: one for the parent grade/clade, and another for the clade with the putative innovation. In the next major section, I discuss limits to inference in phylogenetic diversification models that bear on the utility of these and other tools. Admittedly, the definition above is difficult to apply to single species with distinct or highly specialized ecologies. It is certainly possible that the evolution of a novel ecological strategy in a single lineage can serve to increase the total species richness of the parent clade (e.g. a lineage shifts to an adaptive zone with a carrying capacity of a single lineage); such traits would certainly qualify as key innovations as defined here. However, it will generally not be possible to distinguish this scenario from adaptive change that occurs in a single lineage, and it seems prudent to be cautious in applying innovation terminology to singleton lineages. A range of additional criteria might be incorporated into key innovation tests. Patterns of ecological community structure at the local and regional scale would seem to be a promising area for integration [ 52 , 53 ]. Because key innovations should decouple the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of the innovation-bearing clade and lineages in the ancestral adaptive zone, we should see a corresponding breakdown of any general rule that affects community assembly when comparing taxa in the ancestral adaptive zone to those in the new zone. For example, if local assemblages of species within an adaptive zone are characterized by overdispersion in morphological space [ 54 ], we might predict that this effect will disappear when comparing co-occurring species with and without the hypothesized innovation. However, it is not clear that we should expect to observe characteristic patterns of species interactions within adaptive zones: the interactions may be highly variable, with outcomes contingent on both extrinsic and intrinsic factors as well as the spatial scale over which populations interact [ 34 ], such that it is difficult to derive a priori predictions about the dispersion of species in phylogenetic and functional space. 5. Molecular phylogenies and diversification: a critical perspective Time-calibrated phylogenetic trees contain relatively little information about diversity dynamics, owing to low information content with respect to extinction rates [ 55 \u2013 57 ]. This assertion is controversial [ 58 , 59 ], but I suggest that it should not be because the theoretical information content of a phylogeny with respect to speciation is always higher than for extinction. A phylogeny of N taxa provides absolute confidence that at least ( N \u2212 1) speciation events have occurred. Extinction, in contrast, is not observed directly and relies on a subtle statistical signal in branch-length distributions [ 60 ]. As such, it should be unsurprising on first principles alone that (i) extinction rates are nearly always reconstructed with lower confidence than the corresponding speciation rates, and (ii) extinction rate estimates are highly sensitive to violations of assumptions of the inference model [ 57 ]. Formal diversity-dependent models of speciation and extinction rates [ 26 , 61 , 62 ] are conceptually useful tools, but they are unlikely to provide strong tests of the key innovation hypothesis [ 63 ]. First, diversity-dependent models are generally compared with a trivial null hypothesis (constant-rate speciation\u2013extinction), rather than to more complex alternative models that allow speciation and extinction rates to vary through time; this reliance on trivial null models in diversification studies can lead to incorrect inference [ 64 ]. Second, failure to detect diversity-dependence with a formal diversity-dependent model is largely uninformative: statistical power is low even when the assumptions of the model are perfectly satisfied [ 63 ], and such formal models rely on mathematical trivial characterizations of the diversity-dependent process to achieve analytical tractability. For example, speciation is typically modelled as a simple linear effect of species diversity on the speciation rate [ 35 , 61 , 62 ], and inferences about diversity-dependence from phylogenies are thus conditional on a parametric description of the diversification process with an unknown functional relationship to the true process. Finally, \u2018early burst\u2019 patterns in molecular phylogenies can be consistent with adaptive radiation or innovation, but this interpretation requires numerous caveats. Recent work has demonstrated that a range of alternative processes can produce similar signals in phylogenetic trees [ 65 \u2013 67 ]. Moreover, even if a diversification pulse follows the acquisition of a key innovation, the signal will ultimately be lost due to diversity-dependent lineage turnover [ 32 ]. For some clades, palaeontological data will be sufficient to infer diversity-dependence at the appropriate phylogenetic scale [ 68 , 69 ], and such data may provide important insights into evolutionary innovation and its consequences. 6. Outstanding issues The intention of this article is to assess the conceptual basis for the widespread notion that key innovations should be associated with faster rates of lineage diversification. As such, I have purposefully neglected a broad range of issues relating to the study of key innovations at macroevolutionary scales, including the actual mechanisms by which species interactions might influence macroevolutionary dynamics [ 34 \u2013 37 ]). An unrelated but operationally significant issue relates to the possibility that the ancestral grade from which the lineage with the innovation is derived has become extinct entirely, leaving no extant lineages with which to construct a robust test of the key innovation hypothesis [ 3 ]. I have not discussed the mode of innovation itself, although the general conclusions reached here should apply under more complex models for the occupation of new adaptive zones, including correlated progression [ 70 ]. Although the present article emphasizes single traits and discrete shifts in dynamics on phylogenies, there is ample evidence that shifts to new adaptive zones may be the outcome of multiple character changes smeared across a region of a phylogeny, such that there is no single key innovation that can be localized to a specific topological location [ 71 ]. Regardless of the intrinsic mechanisms that facilitate the occupation of new adaptive zones, we should not require that they lead to increased rates of lineage diversification relative to extant sister lineages. 7. Summary In this article, I have briefly reviewed the inference of key innovations from phylogenetic trees and have argued that the link between innovations and rapid or exceptional diversification is not justified. By using \u2018key innovation\u2019 as a synonym for \u2018trait-dependent diversification\u2019, the term loses its conceptual connection to the original theory linking innovation to the occupation of new adaptive zones [ 1 , 2 , 72 ]. I have argued that our definition of key innovations should be consistent with the original intent and associated mechanisms. The approach described here does not yield a simple statistical test that produces a binary \u2018yes/no\u2019 classification of traits as key innovations, but relies on careful study and interpretation of traits, ecologies and diversification in a phylogenetic framework. Regardless of the perspective given here, the research community can choose which framework to adopt: do we want a concept of key innovation that is highly testable but largely devoid of mechanism? Or should the concept reflect a bridging process between ecology and macroevolution that has long captured the imagination of natural historians and evolutionary biologists? In my opinion, it is this latter approach that provides the strongest foundation for understanding how the evolutionary dynamics of populations and communities have played out through the immensity of time to define the most iconic patterns and trends in the history of life.

The strength of social transmission is inferred from the extent to which the diffusion (spread) of the innovation follows a social network. NBDA can have two goals: (a) to establish whether social transmission is occurring and how strong its effects are; and/or (b) to establish the typical pathways of information transfer. The technique has been used in a range of taxa, including primates, cetaceans, birds and fish, using a range of different types of network. Here I investigate the conceptual underpinnings of NBDA, in order to establish the meaning of results using different networks. I develop a model of the social transmission process where each individual observation of the target behaviour affects the rate at which the observer learns that behaviour. I then establish how NBDAs using different networks relate to this underlying process, and thus how we can interpret the results of each. My analysis shows that a different network or networks are appropriate depending on the specific goal or goals of the study, and establishes how the parameter estimates yielded from an NBDA can be interpreted for different networks. This article is part of the themed issue \u2018Process and pattern in innovations from cells to societies\u2019. 1. Introduction In recent years, there has been a substantial interest in better understanding how and why non-human animals use social information [ 1 \u2013 3 ], and particularly understanding if novel behaviour (innovations) can diffuse through populations as a result of social transmission (learning from others) [ 4 ]. A capacity for social transmission has been demonstrated in many species using a traditional demonstrator\u2013observer paradigm [ 5 ]. By contrast, recent studies have focused on studying the diffusion of innovations in freely interacting groups of animals in the field (e.g. [ 6 , 7 ]) or in captivity (e.g. [ 8 , 9 ]), aiming to assess the importance of social transmission in the spread of behaviour, and elucidate typical pathways of transmission. However, in many cases it can be challenging to determine whether the spread of innovations is caused by social transmission, or purely the product of asocial learning (see also [ 10 ]). One approach to this problem is to use diffusion data: time-structured data on the spread of behaviour through a population or group. Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) is one such approach which infers social transmission if the spread of an innovation follows a social network [ 11 , 12 ]. For example, in 1980 a few humpback whales ( Megaptera novaeangliae ) were observed displaying a novel hunting behaviour, called \u2018lobtail feeding\u2019 whereby they would strike the water's surface with their tails before engaging in their usual bubble-feeding routine. This innovation diffused through the population over the course of the next 27 years. NBDA was used to show that the diffusion of the innovation followed a social network, providing evidence that it spread by social transmission [ 6 ]. In this case, and most applications of NBDA, the social network used is a pre-established association network (e.g. [ 6 , 13 ]) that is assumed to reflect opportunities for learning between each pair of individuals [ 12 ]. However, a number of different types of social network (e.g. based on different types of interactions between individuals) can be constructed and used in an NBDA [ 14 ] representing different hypothetical pathways about the pathways of social transmission. There are two main objectives a researcher might have in applying an NBDA: (a) to establish whether social transmission is occurring and how strong its effects are; and/or (b) to establish the typical pathways of social transmission in a population, group or context. However, it is not currently well established how an NBDA using each of the various kinds of networks relates to the underlying process of social learning. Such a conceptual foundation to NBDA is required if researchers are to (a) know what kinds of network can be validly used to validly accomplish each goal, and (b) interpret the results of an NBDA using a particular type of network. In this paper, I develop such a conceptual foundation, by presenting a simple, but realistic model of the social learning process, whereby observation of performance of the behaviour offers a naive individual the opportunity to learn that behaviour pattern for itself. I then use the model to assess the validity of different types of social network for each of the two goals, and establish how the results of an NBDA should be interpreted. I also use simulations to assess how error in the measured network impacts on the outputs of an NBDA, and assess whether error in a network influences the interpretation of the results. 2. Network-based diffusion analysis The basic NBDA model states that at time t an individual, i , learns a target innovation at rate: 2.1 where \u03bb 0 is the baseline (asocial) rate of learning, a ij is the social network connection from j to i , z i ( t ) is the status of individual i : informed = 1 (has learned the target behaviour), or naive = 0, and s is a parameter, fitted to the data, estimating the strength of social learning relative to asocial learning. The term means that individuals learn at a rate proportional to their connection to informed individuals, and the term means that only naive individuals can learn. If the diffusion follows the network closely, s is estimated to be large. The model can be fitted to data giving only the order in which individuals learn (order of acquisition diffusion analysis or OADA) or the times at which they learn, in continuous time, or in discrete time periods (continuous/discrete time of acquisition diffusion analysis or TADA) [ 11 , 12 ]. TADA has more statistical power, but OADA makes fewer assumptions about the time course of asocial learning [ 12 ]. In all cases the model is compared with a null model in which there is no social transmission ( s = 0) to establish the strength of evidence for social transmission. Models can be fitted using maximum-likelihood [ 11 , 12 ] or Bayesian approaches [ 15 , 16 ]. In this paper, I use the former approach in simulations owing to its reduced computational complexity. Code for implementing NBDA in the R statistical environment [ 17 ], along with instructions, can be found at https://lalandlab.st-andrews.ac.uk/freeware/ . The basic NBDA model given in equation (2.1) has been expanded so that potentially confounding variables can be included and statistically controlled for [ 12 ] and so that it can account for a non-constant rate of asocial learning [ 18 ]. Franz & Nunn [ 19 ] have investigated the effect of inaccuracies in the times of acquisition data, and Whalen & Hoppitt [ 16 ] have shown that NBDA is robust to departures from the assumption of a linear relationship between \u03bb i ( t ) and a ij . However, little work has been done on the effect of inaccuracies in the social network itself. Consequently, in this paper I assess the effect of various types of inaccuracies that might affect the recording of the social network a ij . But first, I develop a model of social learning that is more realistic than the model underlying NBDA (equation (2.1)), at the mechanistic level, and use this to establish the conceptual foundations for NBDA. 3. A realistic model of social transmission Here I develop a simple model of the social transmission process that is mechanistically realistic in groups of non-human animals, i.e. observation of performance of the behaviour offers a naive individual the opportunity to learn that behaviour pattern for itself. The model, and NBDA itself, may also be applicable to the diffusion of innovations in humans where the mechanism is relatively simple. However, the model is not intended to capture \u2018complex contagions\u2019 in which transmission relies on interactions with multiple contacts, and includes mechanisms such as judgement of credibility and legitimacy of innovations prior to adoption ([ 20 ], see also [ 21 , 22 ]). I start from the assumption that each time an individual i observes the target behaviour being performed by individual j there is a probability, , that i learns the target behaviour. Therefore, the rate of transmission from j to i , T ij is given by: 3.1 where O ij is the rate at which i observes j . We can further break the model down to: 3.2 where B j is the rate at which j performs the behaviour, once it has learned it, and p obs ,ij is the probability that a given performance of the behaviour by j is observed by i . Thus, the rate at which a naive individual acquires the novel behaviour to its repertoire, at a given time, t , will be: 3.3 where \u03bb 0 is the rate of asocial learning, and z j ( t ) gives the status of individual j at time t (1 = informed, 0 = naive). This corresponds closely to the basic NBDA model given in equation (2.1), where 3.4 s is fitted to the data and scales the rate of social transmission relative to the rate of asocial learning, \u03bb 0 . This is because in equation (2.1) the rate of transmission from j to i is given by , whereas in equation (3.3) this is given by T ij , or, equivalently, . Consequently, the more closely a social network, a ij , approximates T ij , (scale aside) the better it will tend to predict the order and time of diffusion in an NBDA. However, the exact meaning of the s parameter, estimated by the NBDA, will depend on exactly what network a ij is used (e.g. association versus interaction networks), as will the meaning of the model itself, when compared with models using alternative social networks. One of the key goals of this paper is to establish how an NBDA should be interpreted when different types of network are used. Thus far, I assume that social transmission occurs via observation, whereas instead it could occur when i encounters the products of j 's behaviour, as has been observed in a number of cases of non-human social learning (e.g. [ 23 ]). In such cases the model might still apply: here instead O ij is the rate at which i encounters the products of j 's behaviour, and p ij is the probability of learning the behaviour from each encounter. In the remainder of the paper I refer to cases where social transmission occurs via observation, but analogous logic applies to cases where the transmission pathway does not operate via direct observation. As noted above, there are two main objectives a researcher might have in applying an NBDA. Aim 1 is to establish whether social transmission is occurring and how strong its effects are. For this goal, a researcher ideally requires a social network that captures the opportunities for social transmission as directly as possible. Intuitively, the extent to which the diffusion follows such a network then reflects the importance of social transmission relative to asocial learning. Aim 2 is to determine the particular types of relationship that are important in providing the opportunity to observe and learn. Here, each network can be seen as a competing hypothesis, with the aim of NBDA being to establish which one best approximates the patterns of transmission among individuals ( T ij ). Given that part of this goal is to determine the types of relationship that determine opportunities to learn, a network that provides a direct quantification of such opportunities is not a useful predictor variable. In this paper, I will examine each aim in turn, and with reference to my simple model of the transmission process, look at the kind of networks that might be used to address each question. I also assess the effects error in the measured social network has on estimates of the importance of social transmission (i.e. Aim 1). It is well known that sampling of animal interactions and associations can be incomplete, often because animals are missed during a given sampling period [ 24 ]. In some cases, incomplete sampling is likely to result in random noise applied to the network. However, of more concern is the possibility that individuals may be more likely or less likely to be missed when they are together than when they are apart, resulting in large network connections being under- or overestimated relative to smaller ones. Hoppitt & Farine [ 24 ] show that the indexes commonly believed to correct such bias (e.g. the half-weight index [ 25 ]) do so by an arbitrary amount, and are likely to either under-correct or over-correct the bias. It is possible to calculate corrected association indexes, but this requires calibration data to assess the degree of error to be corrected, which may not be possible to obtain in all studies [ 24 ]. Thus it is vital that researchers using association indexes know the effects that noise and bias might have on their findings. While work has been conducted on the effect error can have on inferences about network structure (e.g. [ 26 ]), it has not yet been established what effect noise and bias in the network have in an NBDA. In this paper, I conduct simulations to address this question. 4. NBDA Aim 1: detecting and quantifying social transmission Here the goal is to assess the strength of evidence that social transmission is operating, and to estimate the effect social transmission has, with confidence intervals providing a plausible range. There are two main types of network that could be used, depending on how closely the diffusion process was observed and documented. (a) Observation networks In an ideal case, a researcher would know exactly when the innovation was performed, by whom, and who observed each performance. While such cases might seem rare, it is possible to attain data close to this level of resolution in cases where the target behaviour is only performed in a specific location that can be monitored closely. For example, Hobaiter et al. [ 7 ] applied NBDA to show evidence of social transmission of a tool using innovation, moss sponging, in a group of chimpanzees. Moss sponging is the use of pieces of moss as sponges to obtain water from holes in trees (differing from the usual use of folded leaves), and the initial spread was documented at a single water hole. A similar situation may be easy to achieve empirically using a novel artificial foraging task (e.g. [ 27 ]) that can be monitored closely by the researcher. At first glance, one might attempt to fit a model in which is modelled directly; however, this model deviates from the form of the standard NBDA. A standard NBDA assumes that transmission occurs at a rate that is proportional to a network connection between two individuals, whereas the model specified in \u00a73 assumes there is a probability of learning from each discrete observation event. Furthermore, in order to fit a model in which is estimated directly, we need to be able to ascertain whether learning has occurred as a result of a given observation event. The only way we have to infer this is by observing i perform the behaviour itself. Therefore, one has to address the question of how long after observing the behaviour i will perform it, given learning has occurred. A practical solution is to use an NBDA that approximates this process, by creating a dynamic observation network. I define a dynamic observation network, a ij ( t ), as giving the number of times i has observed j performing the behaviour prior to time t . Hobaiter et al. [ 7 ] extend the NBDA model to allow use of a dynamic network. This model assumes that social transmission occurs at a rate that is proportional to the number of times the behaviour has been observed in the past. This model is perhaps less realistic than that specified above, because it seems improbable that an individual can continue to learn an innovation as a result at observing it at some time in the past, and that the effect of all such observations on the rate of learning would be cumulative. But the model might be used to approximate the case where is constant across individuals. An alternative is to use a static network, where a ij gives the number of times i observed j up until the point at which i learned the behaviour [ 7 ]. However, a static observation network does not fully allow for the time course of observations. For example, imagine a group of three individuals: A, B and C. A learns the behaviour first. Next, B observes A performing the behaviour three times and then learns the behaviour. Finally, C observes A performing the behaviour four times and subsequently learns the behaviour last. A static network would represent the network as having links of strength 3 from A to B and 4 to C, so an NBDA model based on this network would predict that C was more likely to learn second. In reality, we might expect B to be more likely to learn second, because B observed A performing the behaviour first. A dynamic network allows us to incorporate this information into the NBDA. Supporting this, Hobaiter et al. [ 7 ] found that an NBDA using a dynamic observation network had substantially more power than an NBDA using a static observation network. Use of an observation network has the advantage that even when there is no social structure in the population, social transmission can be inferred if the chance order in which individuals observe the behaviour predicts the order of diffusion (this is illustrated in the simulation below). If p learn = 0, then we would not expect the diffusion to follow the observation network, and we would expect the s parameter in the NBDA not to be significantly greater than 0. Likewise, the greater p learn is, the greater our estimate of s will be, although s does not give an estimate of p learn . However, one can use the estimate of s to estimate the proportion of learning events that occurred by social transmission (as opposed to asocial learning), allowing an interpretable measure of social transmission to be obtained. For each acquisition event, e, at time t e , one calculates the probability of social transmission as: 4.1 then takes the mean of across acquisition events to estimate the proportion that occurred via social transmission (see [ 6 ] for more details). To test the performance of observation networks I simulated data from the model specified in equation 3.2 (see electronic supplementary material for details). I found that type 1 error rate was appropriate if slightly conservative, with the null hypothesis being rejected in 3.1% of cases when . Power increased rapidly as increased, showing that the dynamic network NBDA is able to detect social transmission occurring by the more realistic model even in the absence of any social structure (see electronic supplementary material, figure S1a; power is increased in the presence of underlying social structure, see electronic supplementary material, figure S2). However, the model did tend to slightly overestimate the proportion of events that occurred by social learning, with the true value lying above the 95% confidence intervals in more than 5% of simulations (see electronic supplementary material, figure S1b). A concern with use of a dynamic observation network arises if the target behaviour is performed in a specific location or locations. For example, the moss sponging documented by Hobaiter et al. [ 7 ] was performed at a particular water hole. In these cases, a recorded observation for i may simply indicate that i was in the area appropriate for performing/learning the behaviour, and thus have been more likely to learn the target behaviour in the near future. Such an effect may look like social transmission in the NBDA. Hobaiter et al. [ 7 ] address this problem by including a variable giving each individual's exposure to the relevant location in the NBDA, and thus statistically controlling for it. Ideally exposure would be included as a time-varying variable (e.g. proportion of time spent in the target area each day) to allow for the possibility that patterns of changing exposure correlate with patterns of observation. In conclusion, if detailed data are available on when the target behaviour is performed, by whom, and who observed each performance, use of a dynamic observation network is the most direct way to detect and quantify the effects of social transmission. (b) Association networks In most cases, researchers will not be able to document every performance and observation of the target innovation, but have a good idea of the order in which (and potentially times at which) individuals learned the target behaviour. In such cases, one can use an association network, where a ij represents the proportion of time i spends associating with j (see [ 24 , 28 , 29 ] for reviews of techniques for estimating association networks). The assumption is that individuals can only learn from one another when they are associating; thus the rate of transmission from j to i , T ij , will be proportional to a ij . For this logic to be valid, the criterion for i to be recorded as associating with j has to be specified at the appropriate spatial scale [ 30 ]. Individuals recorded as associating must be within a range at which observation can occur, whereas individuals not recorded as associating must tend to be at a distance at which observation is not possible. This is the case in Allen et al. 's [ 6 ] aforementioned humpback whale study, where the study was conducted over an area of approximately 1000 square miles. In contrast, other studies on captive groups of birds [ 8 , 31 ] have used a criterion for association based on proximity (e.g. nearest neighbour) within an enclosure of a few square metres\u2014meaning that dyads not recorded as associating are still able to observe one another's behaviour. The discussion in this section pertains to the former kind of association network, whereas I return to the interpretation of the second kind, which I refer to as \u2018small-scale association networks\u2019 in \u00a75b. Note that if patterns of association are known to change over the course of the diffusion, a dynamic association network a ij ( t ) could be used. In an NBDA using an appropriate association network, a ij is an estimate of , with B j = B and assumed to be approximately constant across individuals (though variation in learning rates can be modelled using individual covariates [ 8 ]). Therefore, from equation (3.4), the s parameter can be taken as an estimate of , the rate at which information is transmitted from an informed to a naive individual during periods when they are associating, relative to the rate of asocial learning. Alternatively, there may be variation in B j , which is implicitly assumed to be constant in the standard NBDA. However, if data are available on the rate at which each individual performs the behaviour once they have learned it, this can be used to weight the association network and account for this variability [ 13 ]. Here, a ij is replaced by W j a ij , where the transmission weight W j is an estimate of B j . This means that the meaning of the s parameter is now changed. From equation (3.3), in a weighted NBDA s now estimates , i.e. the probability of learning each time i observes j perform the target behaviour, relative to the rate of asocial learning. However, the estimated proportion of events can still be calculated from equation (4.1) by replacing a ij with W j a ij , allowing some comparison between weighted and un-weighted NBDAs. In the electronic supplementary material I present simulations showing both that inclusion of transmission weights can increase statistic power to detect social learning and that models with transmission weights fit the data better, as judged by Akaike's information criterion, AICc. This suggests that if transmission weights are available, they should be included in the analysis if they decrease AICc, as this indicates the model is more realistic and may result in better power to detect social transmission. However, these simulations also show that if transmission weights are not available, but a researcher suspects variation in B j , he/she can still use an un-weighted NBDA as a valid means to detect and quantify social transmission. Note that transmission weights can be used with other types of networks too, where there is measured variation in performance rate (see \u00a75d). (c) Effects of error in the social network Error could potentially arise in both dynamic observation networks and, as outlined above, in association networks. Here I conduct simulations to assess the effect of such error on the detection of social transmission and the estimates of its importance using NBDA. Full details of the simulations outlined below are provided in the electronic supplementary material. Note that the purpose of the simulations presented in this paper is not to draw general inferences about the power of NBDA for given values of s , or the relative power of OADA and TADA, which depend on sample size, network structure and whether asocial learning occurs at a constant rate [ 18 ]. Rather, the aim is to see how NBDA responds to errors in network structure. When using an observation network researchers do not know for sure when an observation has occurred, because it is difficult to know what a subject is attending to (especially with non-human animals). In reality, some kind of proxy is used, such as: individuals within 1 m, with head orientated towards the performer and with an unobstructed view [ 7 ]. Potentially, individuals recorded as observers might not really have been observers, and some observers might have been missed (e.g. if they are outside the threshold distance). Critics of the use of observation networks might suggest that this uncertainty renders the results unreliable. I re-ran the simulations and analyses described in \u00a74a, varying the degree of error in the network: i.e. the probability an individual recorded as an observer really was an observer (). For all values of , the type 1 error rate remained approximately constant at 2.9\u20133.3%, showing that error in identifying observers does not increase the risk of a spurious social transmission effect (see figure 1 a,c ). Instead, power to detect social transmission was reduced as decreased (see figure 1 b ), accompanied by a tendency to underestimate the proportion of events occurring by social transmission (see figure 1 d ). This counteracts the tendency of the dynamic network NBDA to overestimate the importance of social transmission. Only when observers are identified with very high reliability (which is probably unachievable in practice) are overestimates produced. This means that researchers using a dynamic observation network should consider their estimates to be slightly conservative if good data on observers are available, and highly conservative if only a crude proxy for observation can be obtained.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "akaike", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nunn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hobaiter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nbda", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hoppitt & farine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "whalen & hoppitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tada", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-23T18:56:48.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ee0c93bf3533221be374d24d78f4d8b588aa4f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmynsFrIlX2VsSkc9GijawprHMMYse9yPEK_yXle1aj_nFuguqhfowYaClldVhNWJZnebLOHldWvX5XRtQZVkf6", "site_full": "rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org", "site": "royalsocietypublishing.org", "site_section": "http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/rss/recent.xml", "site_categories": ["science", "biology"], "section_title": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences recent issues", "title": "The origin of heredity in protocells", "title_full": "The origin of heredity in protocells", "published": "2017-10-23T10:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45018, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8ee0c93bf3533221be374d24d78f4d8b588aa4f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmynsFrIlX2VsSkc9GijawprHMMYse9yPEK_yXle1aj_nFuguqhfowYaClldVhNWJZnebLOHldWvX5XRtQZVkf6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "West, T., Sojo, V., Pomiankowski, A., Lane, N.", "published": "2017-10-23T10:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "The origin of heredity in protocells", "text": "Download powerpoint Figure 3.

Discussion The model shows that a rudimentary form of heredity can drive the synthesis of organic molecules within protocells, promoting their growth and reproduction. The model is based on a very simple form of carbon fixation in cells, the use of the proton-motive force to drive the reduction of CO 2 by H 2 in some autotrophic organisms. This conception is based on the membrane-bound proton-motive NiFe hydrogenase Ech (energy-converting hydrogenase) found in contemporary methanogens [ 39 \u2013 41 ]. Unlike other forms of CO 2 reduction such as photosynthesis, which involve multiple enzyme complexes, CO 2 fixation via Ech requires only two Fe(Ni)S enzymes: Ech itself and ferredoxin [ 39 ]. The Fe(Ni)S cofactors in these proteins have similar structures to the FeS minerals that form spontaneously in many hydrothermal systems [ 36 , 42 ]. The geological process of serpentinization generates H 2 at mM concentrations in alkaline hydrothermal systems [ 49 ]. CO 2 concentrations in the oceans were probably orders of magnitude higher 4 billion years ago than today [ 52 , 53 ], hence Hadean oceans were more acidic and alkaline vents were less carbon starved than modern systems. Alkaline hydrothermal flow sustains steep pH gradients of 3\u20135 pH units within the porous interior of these vents, with alkaline fluids at a pH of around 11 [ 46 \u2013 49 ] and percolating Hadean ocean waters at perhaps pH 6. [ 52 , 53 ]. This means that all the required conditions for the abiotic equivalent of CO 2 reduction via Ech should have been present in Hadean alkaline hydrothermal vents: high concentrations of H 2 and CO 2 , a geochemically sustained proton-motive force, and Fe(Ni)S minerals equivalent in structure to the active sites of modern FeS proteins such as Ech and ferredoxin [ 23 , 36 \u2013 41 ]. These conditions should drive CO 2 reduction across fatty acid membranes to form new organics within protocells, promoting the emergence of faster growing protocells, giving rise to a rudimentary form of heredity. The emergence of heredity in abiotic protocells in our model is driven by several interlinked positive feedbacks, depicted in figure 1 , which together give rise to self-amplifying growth. FeS minerals chelate simple organic molecules such as hydrophobic amino acids, which we assume can influence three properties of FeS nanocrystals: (i) their growth rate, (ii) partitioning to lipid bilayers, and (iii) catalytic capability. First, we assume that the chelation of hydrophobic amino acids to the surface of growing FeS crystals will hinder their growth, blocking further attachment of Fe 2+ and HS \u2013 to a crystal surface. A larger number of small nanocrystals should therefore form from the same total FeS input, giving a greater catalytic surface area. Second, chelation with hydrophobic amino acids (or other small organics) should promote the partitioning of nanocrystals to the lipid phase of protocell membranes, in part because chelated nanocrystals are more hydrophobic, and in part because small nanocrystals are more likely to be physically accommodated within the lipid bilayer (but see below). Third, we assume that the chelated FeS crystals have improved catalytic properties relative to naked FeS crystals, because (in addition to the larger total surface area) the physical interactions between FeS nanocrystals and amino acids will tend to mimic the active site of FeS proteins such as Ech and ferredoxin. Critically, partitioning of chelated FeS minerals to the membranes of a protocell situated in a geologically sustained proton gradient would provide a simple abiotic equivalent to Ech in methanogens, which draws on the proton-motive force to drive CO 2 reduction by H 2 [ 39 \u2013 41 ]. From this model, we determined the parameter space where protocell growth and reproduction can occur ( figure 2 ). The results show that, across a range of values, growth and heredity are possible in principle. At higher catalytic rates and tighter amino acid binding constants, protocells grow and divide ( figure 3 ), corresponding to the three criteria for innovations laid out by Hochberg et al . [ 54 ]\u2014a gain in phenotypic complexity (chelated FeS crystals partitioning to the membrane); a novel function (autotrophic growth of protocells); and a significant ecosystem impact (rudimentary heredity enabling the fastest replicators to dominate). Little is known about whether the specific parameter values used in our modelling are reasonable. They should not be interpreted literally, but thought of as indicative of conditions that promote protocell functioning. The advantage of rigorous modelling is that it dissects the individual steps involved and points to what needs to be tested experimentally, which should help determine the plausibility of the conceptualization. Nonetheless, several considerations suggest that the model parameters are not unreasonable. FeS minerals can catalyze CO 2 reduction to form organics, albeit the reduction is not facile and most researchers have considered CO rather than CO 2 [ 55 \u2013 58 ]. Heinen & Lauwers [ 58 ] showed that CO 2 can be reduced to various organics by H 2 S. Applying an electrochemical overpotential of 1 V can also drive CO 2 reduction to pyruvate on Fe(Ni)S nanoparticles [ 59 , 60 ]. The pH-dependent modulation of reduction potential suggested here (equivalent to the mechanism of Ech in methanogens [ 40 , 61 ]) can drive formation of formaldehyde at nM [ 61 ] or even \u00b5M quantities (N Lane 2016, unpublished observations). Theoretical thermodynamic modelling shows that the synthesis of total cell biomass, and especially amino acids and fatty acids, is favoured from H 2 and CO 2 under alkaline hydrothermal conditions (pH 11, 25\u2013125\u00b0C) [ 50 , 51 ]. We have delineated a testable succession of carbonylation and hydrogenation reactions by which pH differences across FeS barriers could drive the reverse incomplete Krebs cycle [ 62 ]. The postulated first step, Fe(Ni)S catalysis of organic synthesis from H 2 and CO 2 , is therefore plausible. Likewise, evidence suggests that amino acids such as cysteine can interact with FeS minerals, altering their catalytic properties and surface area [ 63 , 64 ]. \u03b1-Ketoacids such as pyruvate (and even simpler organics such as formaldehyde, CH 2 O) can promote the formation of greigite (Fe 3 S 4 ) rather than iron pyrites (FeS 2 ) from the metastable FeS mineral mackinawite (FeS) [ 65 ]. This is noteworthy because the Fe 3 S 4 clusters found in ferredoxin, Ech and other FeS proteins have the same unit-cell structure as greigite [ 36 , 42 ]. So the basic premise that organic interactions with FeS minerals can modulate their catalytic properties also has some foundation. Whether chelation by organics can obstruct crystal growth is uncertain, but can be addressed experimentally. Likewise, little is known about whether chelated FeS minerals can partition to lipid bilayers. FeS minerals such as mackinawite do have hydrophobic surfaces and can adsorb lipids and other hydrophobic molecules [ 64 \u2013 67 ], so the premise is not unreasonable, but experimental elucidation is needed. A more complicated rendering of the model could investigate changes in crystal mass over time, but the outcomes would most likely be trivial. If crystals were to grow so large that they occluded the entire cytosol, or burst the membrane when lost from the cell, then plainly those protocells would not be capable of hereditary proliferation. Conversely, if the rate of crystal growth or nucleation fell so low that the crystal load dwindled, then growth would cease. We therefore consider only the conditions where growth and cell division are possible, and specify the parameter range in which heredity could in principle be established. That gives specific predictions about crystal growth and membrane partitioning that can be tested experimentally. Another issue that needs to be addressed experimentally concerns the distance over which geological proton gradients can operate. The model assumes that steep pH gradients of 3\u20136 pH units operate across micrometre distances. Microfluidic studies show that laminar flow through hydrothermal-scale pores can support pH gradients of up to 6 pH units across micrometre distances, so steep gradients are certainly feasible [ 68 ]. However, the specific topology of the model is abstract, and might represent too generous a scenario. More realistically, we envisage laminar flow through remote channels, linked by proton-permeable inorganic barriers or through fluid connections to static channels cut off from the main hydrothermal flux [ 69 ]. The membranes of protocells growing in such static channels could then act as the principal proton insulation between remote active channels, enabling steep pH gradients to form even though they are supported by distant hydrothermal flow. This hypothesis needs to be tested experimentally. The system of membrane heredity described here is both simpler and more closely based on living cells than earlier proposals. Cavalier-Smith has invoked a form of membrane heredity in \u2018obcells\u2019 in which a hydrophobic genetic machinery is inserted into the membrane of an inverted cell, giving fixed units of selection (arguably avoiding the problem of Spiegelman's monsters) [ 70 , 71 ]. But this system presupposes the existence of peptidyl-tRNAs with hydrophobic tails associated with obcell membranes, and growth on polyphosphate surfaces [ 70 , 71 ]. There is no evidence for the existence of such obcells or for growth coupled non-enzymatically to polyphosphate surfaces. Perhaps the closest equivalent to our proposal was from Morowitz et al . in 1987 [ 72 ]. They presented a strong argument for protocells as the optimal context for nurturing the origins of RNA and heredity, though their proposed basis for protocell growth was rather different to ours. They suggested that protocells acquired rare amphiphilic pigments from the environment, which enabled them to conserve light energy as a proton-motive force across membranes, driving the formation of pyrophosphate and the coupled conversion of more common environmental precursor molecules into new membrane amphiphiles [ 72 ]. The idea is similar to ours as it involves proton gradients across protocell membranes. However, there is no heredity because the growth of new protocells depends on random interactions with pigments and amphiphile precursors in the environment\u2014daughter cells have no better likelihood of making copies of themselves than any other protocells in the same environment. Some specific details are also problematic. The active generation of proton gradients across leaky fatty acid membranes is not simple [ 44 ] and the idea calls on a rudimentary form of photosynthesis at the origin of life, for which there is no evidence from either phylogenetics [ 43 , 73 \u2013 75 ] or metabolic physiology [ 43 , 76 \u2013 78 ]. In our view, the presence of some form of self-amplifying heredity is a crucial step in the origin of living systems, and must have preceded the replicative heredity of nucleotides. This is also the pretext of the \u2018lipid-world\u2019 hypothesis [ 27 \u2013 29 ], which developed the ideas originally laid out in Morowitz et al . [ 72 ] to give a rudimentary membrane heredity in which the lipid composition of vesicles (the \u2018composome\u2019) can be influenced through lipid catalysis, so that environmentally produced amphiphiles are assembled into the membrane with similar composition to the parent vesicle [ 27 \u2013 29 ]. While the GARD (graded autocatalysis replication domain) model shows that inheritance is possible in principle [ 28 , 29 ], the idea has been challenged on the basis that stochastic variations prevent robust inheritance and limit evolvability [ 30 ]. There are several other limitations too. The model depends on feeding with amphiphiles from the environment, and so can only evolve if amphiphiles with the right properties happen to be present. Such heterotrophic origins are inconsistent with phylometabolic evidence suggesting that the first cells were autotrophic, growing from H 2 and CO 2 [ 40 , 42 , 73 \u2013 78 ]. Perhaps more importantly, there is no obvious link between the lipid-world hypothesis and the origins of catalysis by amino acids, short polypeptides, nucleotides or ribozymes\u2014no clear path from a lipid world to the origins of RNA and genetic heredity. In contrast, our proposal generates true heredity, in which faster-replicating protocells are more likely to make copies of themselves, through a series of simple positive feedbacks. These lead to the self-amplifying synthesis of new organic matter, including both amino acids and fatty acids, inside the protocell itself. Internal synthesis provides a natural concentrating mechanism as well as a localized high-energy environment capable of promoting further chemistry, including the eventual synthesis of nucleotides, RNA and DNA. This is consistent with autotrophic origins and with the specific mechanism of carbon fixation in methanogens [ 23 , 36 \u2013 41 ]. Rather than being linked specifically with energy transduction (via pyrophosphate or ATP), the proton gradient is coupled to carbon fixation and so drives protocell growth directly. We are not calling on complex molecules such as pigments from the environment, merely Fe 2+ from the ocean and HS \u2013 from hydrothermal fluids. The form of heredity described here operates at the level of the system as a whole, which is conceptually similar to Ganti's chemoton model [ 79 ] in that it links metabolic channelling (through a membrane-bound proto-Ech in our case) with the intra-protocellular synthesis of amino acids and fatty acids, driving growth. The protocells best able to make copies of themselves pass on these properties at the system level: more cytosolic amino acids, more chelated FeS nanocrystals, more partitioning of these crystals to the membrane phase, more organic synthesis and faster growth. In sum, the computational model developed here shows that a simple form of heredity, based on positive feedbacks in the chelation and partitioning of FeS nanocrystals to the membrane, could drive the growth and proliferation of protocells under geologically sustained proton gradients. The fastest-growing protocells are more likely to generate higher concentrations of organics internally, which should promote more complex biochemistry and energy coupling, ultimately giving rise to genetic heredity\u2014an RNA world linked to the growth and proliferation of protocells.

Extended description of the computational model (a) General model description The protocell model presented comprises three compartments: a spherical cytosol; a membrane of fixed thickness equivalent to the fatty acid bilayer which encapsulates the cytosol; and an external sink of infinite volume. We model the growth of crystals within the cytosol by assuming that crystals grow with a constant rate over time, and that losses from the system (due to membrane association or passive diffusion) are replaced by instantaneous nucleations that arise from an equilibrium of Fe 2+ from the ocean water and HS \u2013 from the alkaline vent. The rate of crystal growth is modified by the availability of amino acids that are assumed to chelate crystals and hinder their growth. Chelated crystals are assumed to have a higher propensity for partitioning to the hydrophobic membrane and so membrane association will increase with the availability of amino acids. The proximity of membrane-associated crystals to the proton gradient that exists across the cell membrane is thought to facilitate catalysis and so we use a rate of organic production that is dependent on the total surface area of membrane-bound FeS crystals. A fraction of the total organic yield gives rise to new amino acids and fatty acids in the system. The hydrophobic fraction of amino acids can chelate FeS crystals, whereas fatty acids contribute to growth of the cell membrane. As the membrane surface area grows, it eventually reaches a critical point at which the cell divides and the membrane-bound crystals are divided between the cell and its progeny. (b) Model notation, terminology and units Volumes, surface areas, radii, numbers of molecules and concentrations are given by , , r C , and [ x ] C , respectively, where the subscript x indicates the species and C is the compartment to which it corresponds. If the parameter describes the geometry of a compartment, then the species is omitted (e.g. the volume of the cytosol is given by ). All units of length are standardized to use cm as a base unit for geometries (except in the case of concentrations, in which dm is more conveniently used), and s for time. Species used are: amino acids (aa), fatty acids (fa), FeS crystals (crys), organic molecules (orgs) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). The three compartments in the model are designated by the superscripts , for the cytosol, membrane and external sink, respectively. We use k z to indicate rate constants for process z (s \u22121 assuming first-order kinetics); K x to indicate saturation constants for species x (mol dm \u22123 ); for the molar turnover of process z (mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 ); for permeability coefficients of species x diffusing through the interface of C (cm s \u22121 ); v x for molar rates of formation of species x (mol dm \u22123 s \u22121 ); \u03bb x is the fraction of total organic formation that yields species x (unitless); and A N is Avogadro's number (mol \u22121 ). The number of molecules n is referred to at points in the formulation, in these cases . In the case of crystal population dynamics, the overbar (e.g. ) indicates the mean value, and bold parameters (e.g. V ) are used to indicate that the value is the sum over the whole population (i.e. ). (c) Passive chemical diffusion Chemical diffusion of uncharged species x across the interface of compartment C 1 is modelled using the following generic equation: A 1 The flow is dependent on P , the permeability coefficient; SA / V , the diffusion surface area/volume ratio; and \u0394 C , the chemical driving force between compartments. Fluxes in the model are assumed to occur as single-step processes between cytosol and sink, cytosol and membrane or membrane and sink. (d) Compartments and geometry The protocell cytosol (cyto), membrane (mem) and external environment (sink) are modelled using two finite volume compartments (cytosol and membrane) and a sink of infinite volume. The cytosol is modelled as a sphere of fixed volume. It is enclosed by the membrane compartment which has a volume V mem equal to the enveloping spherical shell: A 2 where and are the radii of the cytoplasm and membrane, respectively. We compute the membrane volume to impose a diffusive limit on the maximum concentration of FeS crystals that can move into it from the cytosol. For simplicity in the model we do not account for water movement and so we fix the cytosolic volume throughout simulations. Instead, the surface area is dynamic and subject to a growth proportional to the amount of fatty acid that is added to the membrane compartment. The thickness of the membrane is constant, but its surface area could grow without an increase in internal volume through furrowing or invaginations of the membrane. We assume that the internal surface of the membrane is equal to the surface area of the cytoplasm . (e) Initializing the crystal population To initiate the simulation, we set an initial mean crystal size, and assume that the cytoplasm has a fixed total volume of crystal,. From this, the number of cytosolic crystals is: A 3 At each integration step the number of crystals within the cell is recalculated given that the mean crystal size can vary through time (see below). A more useful expression is the crystal concentration given the volume of the cytosolic compartment: A 4 where A N is Avogadro's number. (f) Amino acid binding to FeS crystals Several processes in the model, such as crystal growth and membrane association, are dependent on the availability of interacting amino acids within the cytosol. We model amino acid binding to FeS crystals using a saturating Michaelis\u2013Menten expression, with indicating the fraction of crystals bound to amino acids: A 5 The saturation constant K aa sets the concentration of amino acids at which there is half maximal binding. Smaller values of the binding constant are indicative of a higher affinity of amino acids for crystals. We use several times in the model to scale rates of crystal growth as well as diffusion of crystals into and away from the membrane. This allows modelling of amino acid-dependent rates of crystal chelation and membrane association. (g) Crystal movement and membrane partitioning Crystals are subject to diffusion between compartments, which is modelled using the general flux equation (A 1). Diffusion of unbound crystals between the cytosol and sink is given by: A 6 where is the permeability constant of crystal crossing the membrane. Diffusion of amino acid-bound crystals between the cytosol and membrane is given by: A 7 The diffusion term here is multiplied by the amino acid-dependent modifier , such that when , the potential rate of diffusion is near its maximum (see equation (A 5)). is the permeability constant of crystal movement across the interface between cytosol and membrane. Finally, diffusion of amino acid-bound crystals between the membrane and sink is given by: A 8 where again, modification by the term creates an inverse dependence on the availability of amino acids. Thus, the potential for crystals to diffuse away from the membrane is minimized when . The total rate of change of concentration of the membrane-bound crystals is equal to the sum of the fluxes: A 9 (h) Crystal growth rates In the model, we restrict our description of crystal growth to the evolution of the mean of crystal size distribution. For simplicity, we assume that the total volume of crystal within the cell is fixed and the total availability (i.e. number of crystals) is proportional to the total volume of crystal divided by the mean crystal size within the cytosol, equation (A 3). Crystal growth arises from the deposition of FeS on the crystal surface. We consider the rate of growth as a constant process of diffusion that is modified by the crystal concentration and surface area . When the concentration is high we assume that deposition is high. We account for the impact of crystal movement on the crystal size distribution by assuming that loss of crystals from the system has a negative effect on growth (i.e. high efflux results in crystal shrinkage). Losses in crystal mass due to membrane association or permeation are assumed to be replaced by instantaneous re-equilibration with aqueous Fe 2+ and HS \u2212 ions that are maintained at a constant ambient concentration within the cytosol. Thus, the overall change in the mean crystal size decreases when crystal deposition is smaller than crystal efflux due to a net seeding of new crystals within the cell (compensating for the loss of mass from the system), and newly seeded crystals push the population mean to smaller values. To calculate the rate of change in mean crystal size, we first compute an estimate of the rate of change that results from deposition at the crystal surface. We estimate the total molar change to the crystal population by assuming that the process can be modelled as diffusion across the surface area of the population with a driving force dependent on the distance of crystal concentration from its saturation point K crys : A 10 where is a permeability constant that encapsulates the rate of diffusion across the interface of the crystal surface (surf), and is the total surface area of crystal in the cytosol. K crys sets the driving force of the diffusion process of crystal. This constant effectively slows growth of the population as decreases. This assumes that growth is slowed in larger crystals (for discussion of this effect see [ 80 ]). The entire flow is modulated by the amino acid/crystal chelation factor such that when , the potential rate of crystal growth is hindered due to the chelating action of amino acids, equation (A 5). For similar formulations treating crystal nucleation/growth as a diffusive process see [ 80 , 81 ]. (i) Crystal volume dynamics We then make use of the computed flows to modulate rates of change of the mean crystal size. In the model, we assume that crystal growth occurs at a rate that is proportional to the difference between the minimum crystal size (at nucleation) and the mean population crystal size. Furthermore, the entire process is modulated by the balance between the total gains and losses of crystal mass in the system that arise from the transport and growth processes described in the previous sections. We first compute the total crystal mass gains and losses by, respectively, summing the positive and negative flows involving the cytosolic compartment: A 11 where the plus or minus signs indicate the absolute value of the positive or negative components of the rate of crystal concentration change. We then use the ratio of the gains to losses to determine the evolution of the crystal size distribution. The total rate of change for the mean of the crystal size distribution of the population is given by the following equation: A 12 where k grow is a rate constant that determines the evolution of the mean size of the crystal population, and sets a bound on the minimum crystal size, such that when approaches , the total rate of growth is slowed due to the decreased surface area available for diffusion. The equation is multiplied by the ratio of gain to losses from the system, so that when mean crystal size increases, due to a net accumulation of mass on crystal surfaces, while when mean crystal size decreases, as losses of crystal from the system are compensated by nucleation of new, smaller crystals. When gain \u2248 loss then there is no net change in mean crystal size, as the formation of new crystals is balanced by the loss of older (larger) crystals from the system. The minimum crystal size set by and the effective limit on the growth of population imposed by K crys in equation (A 10) ensures that the range of possible crystal size is bounded. (j) Catalytic action of membrane-bound FeS crystals In the model, reduction of CO 2 to form organics is catalyzed by membrane-bound FeS crystals utilizing the chemiosmotic proton gradient that exists across the membrane. We do not explicitly model the proton gradient but instead absorb its effects upon catalysis into the parameter which describes the rate of organic production per unit surface area of available catalyst (in the form of membrane-associated FeS crystals). For simplicity we assume that changes in size of the crystals in the cytosol are instantaneously translated to those found in the membrane. That is . The crystal surface area (i.e. the site of catalytic action) is computed as the surface of a cuboid with a volume given by the average of the crystal size distribution: A 13 so the total surface area of membrane-bound crystal is given by: A 14 Hence the maximum molar rate of product formation is given by: A 15 Adsorbance of CO 2 onto the FeS catalyst is modelled using Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics, whereby adsorbance rates saturate depending on the affinity of the ligand for the binding sites of the crystal. Thus, the total CO 2 -dependent rate of organic formation is given by: A 16 We assume the concentration of CO 2 to be ten times higher than that at the Lost City hydrothermal vents today [ 78 ], which is conservative given that CO 2 levels were probably several orders of magnitude higher in the Hadean [ 48 , 49 ]. Following thermodynamic modelling, new organics are most likely to include fatty acids and amino acids [ 46 , 47 ]. A quarter of the total organic output is assumed to be fatty acid and is partitioned to the bilayer. One tenth of the total organic output is assumed to be hydrophobic amino acids that chelate FeS crystals. We assume that all organics are formed on the inside surface of the membrane and contribute to concentration changes in the cytosolic compartment. The individual rate of change of cytosolic concentrations of amino acids and fatty acids are, therefore, computed as fractions of the total rate of production of organics with the addition of a leak permeability between the cytosol and sink ( for amino acids and fatty acids, respectively): A 17 The terms \u03bb aa and \u03bb fa are the relative fractions of the total yield for hydrophobic amino acids and fatty acids (i.e. 1/10 and 1/4, respectively). (k) Membrane growth We assume membrane growth is proportional to the rate of fatty acid production, and that fatty acids are instantaneously partitioned to the membrane bilayer. The rate of protocell surface area change is then: A 18 where the changes in cytosolic fatty acid concentration are converted to a change in membrane surface area. The molar rate is first converted to a number of molecules via Avogadro's number ( A N ), and then the total surface area of the fatty acid head groups is computed by multiplication with , the single fatty acid head group size. This total area change due to fatty acid addition to the membrane is divided by 2 in order to give an approximation to the surface area of the inner face of the bilayer. Since the model describes cell growth as a rate of surface area change of the cytosol, we re-compute the volume of the membrane at each time step using the radius of the cytoplasm given by the new surface area SA cyto : A 19 (l) State equations Following the rationale outlined above, the dynamics of the system are governed by five state variables that are integrated over time: A 20 (m) Protocell division Simulations of cell division assume a critical threshold at which the cell divides due to constraints of the cell mechanics. At this threshold, we assume that the mean of the crystal size distribution is inherited by progenitor cells and is unchanged. Furthermore, the concentration of amino acids and the concentration of membrane-bound crystals is divided by two as the cells become diluted by water movement during division. We also assume partitioning of cytosolic fatty acids in the process of division, so they are reduced to half their previous concentration. Upon division, the cell bisects and its surface area halves. (n) Notes on integration and MATLAB scripts We implemented the model using Matlab (vR2015b, The Mathworks, MA). We use a single-step forward Euler solver, with a step size of 60 s. Using a step size one order of magnitude smaller was not found to affect results substantially.

Nascent microbial multicellular life cycles in extant microorganisms. Experimentally evolved \u2018snowflake\u2019 yeast have an obligately multicellular life cycle, caused by a loss-of-function mutation at the gene ACE2 [ 25 ]. As a result, daughter cells remain attached to mother cells after mitosis, forming a fractal-like branched growth form. Propagules are produced whenever a cell\u2013cell connection is severed. Despite the rarity of unicellular propagules [ 36 ], the physical structure of snowflake yeast introduces regular genetic bottlenecks, as every cell in a propagule is clonally derived from the cell at its base ( figure 1 ) [ 25 ]. Simple multicellular traits, such as cluster size, are highly heritable ( H 2 = 0.84) [ 25 ], and snowflake yeast readily respond to selection on multicellular traits [ 36 , 37 ]. The volvocine green algae and their unicellular relatives possess a cell cycle that has decoupled growth and reproduction. Individual cells grow, sometimes many times larger than their starting size, then rapidly divide to produce 2, 4 or 8 daughter cells [ 38 ]. In unicellular Chlamydomonas , daughter cells can remain attached after division, forming multicellular palmelloids [ 39 ]. Regardless of whether these collectives disperse via unicells or small clusters of cells, each dispersing unit experiences a unicellular genetic bottleneck ( figure 1 ). The transition to a multicellular life cycle in the volvocine algae appears to have occurred primarily through the co-option of existing genes rather than through the origin of de novo genes [ 40 , 41 ]. Genomic comparisons among unicellular Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , undifferentiated Gonium pectorale and germ/soma differentiated Volvox carteri show that few genes are uniquely shared between G. pectorale and V. carteri , i.e. that few genes are specific to the multicellular members of the clade [ 40 ]. Direct experimental evidence of the importance of co-option comes from a complementation experiment: replacement of the cell cycle regulator mat3 , a retinoblastoma homolog, with the G. pectorale version of the gene causes C. reinhardtii to form colonies of 2\u201316 cells [ 40 ]. Thus, a change to the coding sequence of a cell cycle regulator is sufficient to cause a shift to a multicellular life cycle. Choanoflagellates are a group of unicellular and colony-forming aquatic eukaryotes. They have generated intense interest among evolutionary biologists because they are the closest known living unicellular relatives of animals [ 42 ]. Some species possess extensive developmental plasticity, switching between unicellular and multicellular growth ([ 43 ]; figure 1 ). Multicellular rosettes typically develop from unicells via clonal reproduction [ 44 ], but these bottlenecks are not strict, as rosettes can generate additional rosettes via multicellular propagules [ 43 ]. While genetic conflict is rightfully seen as a major impediment to ETIs, the above examples demonstrate that diverse microbes readily form collectives with little within-group genetic diversity. In the case of small, relatively short-lived collectives such as these, clonal development and regular genetic bottlenecks should be sufficient to maintain this low diversity state, largely immunizing them from within-collective genetic conflict. Conflict, of course, is not the only issue ETIs face: in the next section, we examine how heritable multicellular traits emerge from the properties of cells. 3. Origin of higher-level traits: volvocine algae as a case study Individuals have traits, and adaptive phenotypic change results from selection on those traits. The outcome of an ETI is a new kind of individual, which has traits that did not exist before the transition. Selection on these novel traits results in adaptations at the new, higher level, but where do the new traits come from? A Volvox colony (or spheroid), for example, has a diameter, a behavioural response to light, and an anterior\u2013posterior polarity. A Volvox cell, and for that matter a Chlamydomonas cell, also has these traits, but in each case the colony-level trait is not the cell-level trait. In the most recent unicellular ancestor of Volvox , these traits were defined at the cell level, but in Volvox we can define them at both the cell level and the colony level. Somehow, during the transition from a unicellular to a multicellular life cycle, the colony-level traits came into existence. How did these new traits arise, and how are their values determined? The initial transition to a multicellular life cycle necessarily begins with some mechanism of keeping (or bringing) cells together [ 45 , 46 ]. In the volvocine algae, this was accomplished through modifications to the cell wall that resulted in the formation of an extracellular matrix [ 47 , 48 ]. The resulting colonies may have been similar to those of the modern Basichlamys [ 49 ], in which four Chlamydomonas -like cells are held together by a common extracellular matrix. By forming simple multicellular structures, the ancestors of Basichlamys acquired traits that are defined at the colony level, such as colony diameter and number of cells. In McShea's [ 50 ] terminology, they underwent an increase in hierarchical object complexity, adding an additional hierarchical level (the colony) while retaining all those nested within it (the cell and lower levels). The new, colony-level traits could conceivably affect fitness and vary in heritable ways, thus meeting Lewontin's criteria for adaptive evolution [ 10 ]. Colony diameter is meaningless in the context of unicells. Although unicells have a cell number, they have no heritable variation in cell number. The formation of multicellular structures automatically generates new traits that are potentially capable of adaptive evolution. In both cases, these traits are simple functions of cell-level traits. Colony cell number ( N ) is determined by the number of rounds of cell division ( n ) each cell undergoes to form a daughter colony: N = 2 n . The colony-level trait N potentially meets Lewontin's criteria for adaptive evolution, but it is completely and uniquely determined by the cell-level trait n . Genetic variation in n generates genetic variation in N , which is potentially subject to selection, for example, if small N colonies reproduce more quickly than large N colonies. Colony diameter ( D ) is also potentially subject to selection, for example, if a gape-limited predator preferentially consumes colonies smaller than a threshold diameter. For a spheroidal colony such as Eudorina , D is a function of n , cell volume ( v ) and the volume of extracellular matrix produced by each cell ( e ): . Genetic variation in n , v and/or e generates genetic variation in D . The colony-level trait D is completely determined by the cell-level traits, but different combinations of n , v and e values can generate the same value of D . Colony diameter and cell number are colony-level traits that come into existence as a necessary consequence of the transition to a multicellular life cycle. Although they are simple functions of cell-level traits, neither is defined at the cell level. Rather, they emerge from the properties of the cells. These colony-level traits have the potential to meet Lewontin's criteria for evolution by natural selection at the colony level, and we can expect that selection on the colony-level traits will drive adaptive change in the colony-level traits (provided there is genetic variation). The functions relating colony diameter and cell number to cell-level traits are among the simplest such functions possible. We now consider a colony-level trait whose relationship to cell-level traits is more complicated and more difficult to define. In the volvocine family Volvocaceae, which includes Volvox and a number of smaller spheroidal genera, the process of embryogenesis includes a complete inversion of the developing daughter colony. After cell division, the flagella of the cells are oriented towards the inside of the colony, a situation not conducive to efficient motility. Over the course of an hour or so, the embryos turn themselves inside out, moving the flagella to the outside surface of the colony. Although the details of the inversion process vary among Volvocaceaean species, the fundamentals are similar. Inversion involves a combination of changes in cell shape and movements of the cytoplasmic bridges that connect cells during embryogenesis [ 51 ]. Cells elongate to become spindle-shaped, and the cytoplasmic bridges migrate to the narrow ends of the cells, causing local changes in the curvature of the cell sheet. These changes propagate through the embryo in a spatially and temporally coordinated wave, eventually reversing the curvature of the entire cell sheet and inverting the embryo. How this process is coordinated is not known; cells could be responding to mechanical signals (e.g. stresses from local curvature) [ 52 ] or to chemical signals transmitted through the cytoplasmic bridges. Regardless, inversion is driven by cell-level developmental processes, possibly influenced by plastic responses to local environmental cues. In principle, the colony-level process of inversion could be described as a function of cell-level traits, with arguments possibly including the degree of cell elongation, the number of cytoplasmic connections formed by each cell, and the shapes of reaction norms describing cellular responses to mechanical or chemical signals. The likely complexity of such a function does not change the fact that the colony-level process of inversion is entirely controlled by cell-level traits. The analogous functions underlying many colony-level traits will be even more complex, perhaps even inscrutable. They may include signalling, positional information, feedbacks and more complicated cell\u2013cell interactions. However, their obscurity and complexity do not imply their non-existence. Traits of multicellular organisms must emerge from the traits of their cells; there is no other source. 4. Heritability of higher-level traits Predicting the magnitude of a response to selection requires estimates of both the strength of selection and the heritability of the trait under selection. This relationship is expressed in the breeder's equation of quantitative genetics: R = h 2 S , where R is the response to selection (the difference between mean trait value before and after selection), h 2 is the narrow-sense heritability and S is the selection differential. Narrow-sense heritability is the ratio of additive genetic variance to total phenotypic variance [ 53 ], i.e. Var( A )/Var( P ). In addition to additive genetic variance, the denominator may include environmental effects and the effects of dominance, epistasis (interactions among genes), genotype by environment interactions, maternal effects, etc. For asexual reproduction, the appropriate expression uses broad-sense heritability H 2 [ 53 ]: R = H 2 S . Broad-sense heritability is the ratio of total genetic variance to total phenotypic variance: Var( G )/Var( P ). In this case, genetic effects that are not additive (dominance, epistasis, etc.) are included in the numerator. Because these effects persist in subsequent generations in asexual reproduction, broad-sense heritability, rather than narrow-sense heritability, correctly predicts the response to selection in this case. Both forms of the breeder's equation succinctly capture the basic insight that heritability is just as important as the strength of selection in predicting the magnitude of a response to selection. This is important for any process that involves multilevel selection. Regardless of the strength of selection on a collective-level trait, no adaptive response is possible unless there is heritable variation in the collective-level trait. Since colony-level traits are functions of cell-level traits, the heritability of colony-level traits can, in principle, be related to that of cell-level traits. For complex functions, estimating this relationship may be intractable, but for simple functions it can be calculated. Herron & Ratcliff [ 54 ] derived an analytical solution for the relationship between cell-level and collective-level heritability for traits for which the colony-level trait is a linear function of the cell-level traits. Under reasonable assumptions, the heritability of a collective-level trait is never less than that of the cell-level trait to which it is linearly related. This asymmetry is driven by an advantage groups have over cells: emergent group-level traits depend on the sum of constituent cell phenotypes, which cancels out (by averaging) much of the heritability-lowering effects of cellular phenotypic noise. For more complicated functions relating cell-level to colony-level traits, collective-level heritability is higher under most (but not all) conditions [ 54 ]. A crucial assumption underlying these models is that the development of collectives is clonal, i.e. that particles reproduce asexually within a collective. This roughly corresponds to Queller's \u2018fraternal\u2019 major transitions (Tarnita's \u2018staying together\u2019), in which collectives consist of genetically similar (or identical) particles [ 22 , 46 , 55 ], and it characterizes most multicellular organisms. Land plants, animals, multicellular fungi, red algae, ulvophyte and chlorophyte green algae, and brown algae all develop clonally. Clonal development ensures that within-collective genetic variability is low; the only source of such variability is de novo mutations during development. For a particular trait, especially for small collectives (as are probable early in a transition), it will usually be zero. Nevertheless, phenotypic variability among particles within a collective is inevitable, as stochastic and micro-environmental effects will influence particle phenotypes (both sources of non-genetic variation are treated as \u2018environmental\u2019 components in quantitative genetics models). As long as phenotypic variability is randomly distributed around the genetic mean, though, collectives benefit from an averaging effect, which reduces their non-heritable phenotypic variation relative to the particles that comprise them [ 54 ]. Although collective-level heritability has sometimes been considered a hurdle that must be overcome during an ETI [ 1 , 56 ], these results show that it comes \u2018for free\u2019 when development is clonal [ 54 ]. Heritability of collective-level traits does not have to \u2018arise\u2019 during the transition to a multicellular life cycle (given clonal development)\u2014it must necessarily exist if the underlying cell-level traits are heritable. This is probably true also for other \u2018fraternal\u2019 transitions. Next, we quantitatively examine how nascent multicellular life cycles affect the ability for evolutionary innovation. Specifically, we examine the spread of beneficial mutations across three canonical simple multicellular life cycles and consider the implications of key differences. 5. The spread of a beneficial mutation across different life cycles The structure of a life cycle may affect its capacity to harness beneficial mutations. To explore this idea, we introduce a modelling framework that enables direct comparison of the fixation dynamics of beneficial mutations within different nascent multicellular life cycles ( figure 2 ). In each life cycle, we assume that a mutation arises in a single group during the group stage of a multicellular life cycle. For life cycles that alternate between group and single cell stages, we assume that the mutation occurs right at the end of the group stage so that it begins at some low frequency x 0 within the single cell population. For the life cycle that forgoes a unicellular stage, we assume that, for comparison, the mutation occurs in a group of size N at relative frequency x 0 . In each case, we compute the relative frequency of the mutation in the group's lineage over the course of many life cycles.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lewontin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tarnita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcshea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "herron & ratcliff", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "volvox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eudorina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-23T18:56:57.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b452df35b9459baf063fa5cf1418286fdfce068b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmynsFrIlX2VsSkc9GijawprHMMYse9yPEK_yXle1aj_nFuguqhfowYaClldVhNWJZxY3eUCGGqy9yO2M0qcM2D", "site_full": "rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org", "site": "royalsocietypublishing.org", "site_section": "http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/rss/recent.xml", "site_categories": ["science", "biology"], "section_title": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences recent issues", "title": "Cooperation and cheating as innovation: insights from cellular societies", "title_full": "Cooperation and cheating as innovation: insights from cellular societies", "published": "2017-10-23T10:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45018, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b452df35b9459baf063fa5cf1418286fdfce068b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmynsFrIlX2VsSkc9GijawprHMMYse9yPEK_yXle1aj_nFuguqhfowYaClldVhNWJZxY3eUCGGqy9yO2M0qcM2D", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aktipis, A., Maley, C.

The foundations of multicellular cooperation and cheating. The evolution of multicellularity involved the bringing together of five foundations for cellular cooperation (inside pentagon), in a way that led to a major innovation in this history of life. These five foundations are resource allocation (e.g. circulatory systems), division of labour (e.g. development of specialized organs), the extracellular environment (e.g. skeletons), controlled cell death (e.g. tissues structures such as digits, neural structures) and proliferation inhibition (e.g. cell cycle control). Cheating in each of these foundations (outside pentagon) can disrupt multicellular cooperation, requiring the evolution of further controls in order to maintain effective multicellular function. These forms of cheating can either result from the loss of innovations that make multicellularity viable or from innovations that disrupt and exploit multicellularity through novel functions. Adapted from Aktipis et al. [ 4 ]. The emergence of life cycles at this higher level of organization are an important step in the transition from unicellular to multicellular life, allowing selection to act on the phenotype of the collective more strongly than it acts on the individuals making up that collective. This can tip the scales in favour of mechanisms that increase cellular cooperation within the multicellular body and reduce conflict among cells within the body [ 10 ]. These multicellular life cycles also open up new ecological space, with cells creating and maintaining an extracellular environment that is both their ecological niche and the substrate through which they express their life-history strategy. Thus, multicellular life cycles, realized through coordination of the foundations of multicellular cooperation, appear to represent a key innovation [ 11 ] in the evolution of life. The five foundations of multicellular cooperation arose every time organismal multicellularity evolved. They represented important innovations, allowing organisms to solve adaptive problems, such as growing larger to avoid predators and managing the risks of environmental uncertainty by storing resources in the body. Each of these forms of cooperation is encoded in genetic networks inside each cell. Also encoded into each cell are systems for detecting and responding to cheating in these implicitly encoded \u2018rules\u2019 for cooperation. The problem of controlling cheating has several solutions, and the best solution depends on the type of cellular society. There are two fundamentally different forms of multicellularity: aggregates of genetically different cells that come together to form a body, and clonal organisms that derive from a single cell (e.g. a zygote). The difficulty of controlling cheating when genetically diverse cells come together to form an organism probably explains why multicellular aggregates, such as Dictyostelium , are generally smaller and less complex than multicellular organisms that develop as a clone from a unicellular bottleneck [ 22 , 25 ]. In fact, one viable strategy for stabilizing cooperation in aggregative multicellularity is for the cooperating cells to \u2018walk away\u2019 from aggregates where the burden of cheaters is too high [ 26 , 27 ]. The ability to walk away also applies to cheaters, which may spread from one multicellular aggregate to another [ 22 ]. Clonal multicellular organisms avoid this problem by passing through a unicellular life stage (e.g. a zygote). That unicellular bottleneck ensures all the cells in the body have the same genes and follow the same rules of cooperation. Only somatic mutations and pathogens can introduce cheaters into clonal multicellular organisms. Below, unless otherwise specified, when we refer to multicellularity, we mean clonal multicellularity. 5. Cellular cheating can disrupt multicellular innovations We define cheating here as simply the breakdown of shared rules (including genetically encoded phenotypes or behaviors) that leads to a fitness advantage on the cellular level for the cheater. Aktipis et al. [ 4 , p. 2] Innovations can open up new opportunities for cheating through the loss of the innovation. When mutations occur in the genetic networks that promote cellular cooperation and suppress cellular cheating, this can cause disruptions to the function of the cellular society. In multicellular bodies, cheating on the foundations of multicellular cooperation typically gives rise to cancer or cancer-like phenomena [ 4 ]. These forms of cheating often lead to radical performance improvements for the cheating cells, and change their microenvironment, which establishes new ecological space for further cellular evolution [ 28 ]. Thus, cooperation and cheating in multicellular life can be considered a sort of arms race between cellular societies evolving to promote cooperation and suppress cheating within, while the cells within evolve to \u2018break\u2019 the rules of multicellularity in order to maximize cell-level fitness. The innovation of growth control in the evolution of multicellularity created the opportunity for cells to cheat by not regulating their growth while their neighbours do. And cells that produce their own growth signals cheat by using novel functions. The innovation of using growth signals to regulate the growth of multicellular organisms opened up the possibility that these growth signals could be \u2018hacked\u2019 by cells within the body that produce their own growth signals, even when it is detrimental to the fitness of the organism. This innovation can generate radical performance improvements for the somatic cells that produce their own growth signals [ 28 ]. This is exactly what happens in cancer: cancer cells evolve novel genes that allow them to generate proliferative signals for themselves [ 29 ]. And it does not end there. Cheating can provide the impetus for innovation, selecting for more sophisticated methods of conflict management and cooperation. This is what happened during the evolution of growth regulation systems in multicellular life. Because a growth regulation system based on proliferative signalling can be easily hijacked, selection favoured a complex system of checks and balances on growth that involves many hormones and growth factors whose activity is monitored and controlled by a complex genetic network [ 30 , 31 ]. Cheating can be horizontally transmitted among clonally derived multicellular organisms via pathogens. For example, when human papilloma virus (HPV) causes a chronic infection, it hijacks the host cells, interfering with the p53 and pRb tumour suppressor proteins, and causing their host cells to become cheaters, which may eventually evolve into cancers [ 32 ]. Cells in multicellular bodies do not always follow the implicit, genetically encoded rules of multicellularity, sometimes innovating in ways that cheat on these rules. These innovating cells can contribute to neoplasms which sometimes evolve into cancer [ 33 ]. Neoplasms have a variety of cellular innovations [ 34 ]. We use the technical term neoplasm here, rather than tumour or cancer, because tumours may refer to masses of fibre that are not related to cancers, and innovations occur in neoplasms while they are still benign, not just in cancers. Neoplasms are diverse populations of billions to trillions of mutant cells that can evolve over periods of decades, for tens of thousands of cell generations [ 34 ]. New mutations arise and spread through the neoplastic cell population. Some of the mutations that spread are gain-of-function mutations that cause adaptations in the cells, for example, evading the immune system, generating their own growth signals and stimulating the growth of new blood vessels to feed the neoplasm [ 28 ]. Other mutations are loss-of-function mutations that destroy a previous innovation of multicellular cooperation, such as loss of programmed cell death, and loss of sensitivity to anti-growth signals [ 28 ]. These loss of function mutations, while beneficial to neoplastic cells, are losses of innovations. In other words, some forms of cellular cheating (that can lead to cancer) do not qualify as innovations according to Hochberg et al. 's definition. But many of the forms of cheating that occur in neoplasms clearly fit this definition of innovation, as they involve the introduction of novel functions and radically improve the performance of the neoplastic cells. Gain-of-function mutations often dramatically increase proliferation rates, and the innovation of using anaerobic metabolism, even in the presence of oxygen, increases biosynthesis efficiency, further increasing neoplastic cell proliferation rates [ 28 ]. In fact, some of the innovations in neoplasms actually spur on additional innovations, further disrupting the multicellular body's proper functioning. For example, the genomes of neoplastic cells are often doubled during carcinogenesis, such that the cells have four instead of two copies of all their genes [ 35 ]. This then loosens the constraints on further innovations in the copy numbers of individual genes or chromosomal segments. With more copies of each gene, there are also more opportunities for cellular innovations: adding or subtracting copies of these genes, and modifying some copies while keeping at least one pristine copy of genes necessary for cell survival. Some genes become isolated on pieces of DNA that are not connected to any chromosome, which can facilitate further innovations, including massive amplification, with as many as 30 copies in some cells [ 36 ]. Innovations in cancer go beyond simply adding genes, or even modifying existing genes by mutating base pairs in their coding regions or regulatory regions. Structural rearrangements, like translocations and inversions, can fuse exons from separate genes so as to form entirely novel genes. These fusion genes are often important drivers of carcinogenesis [ 37 ]. Just as multicellularity involves the combining of novel cooperative cell level traits into a new phenotype that represents a true innovation, cancer appears to also involve the combining of several forms of cheating into a new phenotype that represents a true cheating innovation. For example, cheating in both demographic cooperation and economic cooperation may both be required for cancer across species [ 4 ]. This same review suggested that cancer-like phenomena such as overproliferation or dedifferentiation can occur without both types of cheating, but that cancer (i.e. invasive or metastatic growth) may require a combination of both. In other words, the cellular \u2018innovation\u2019 of cancer may require multi-faceted cheating, just as the innovation of multicellularity may require the coordination of several types of cooperation. Future work should help to clarify whether this pattern applies across all forms of multicellularity and cancer or whether it is limited to the species and types of cancer examined in Aktipis et al. [ 4 ] There is also evidence for innovations in the social behaviour of neoplastic cells. In some cases, neoplastic cells may re-evolve the foundations of multicellular cooperation but within the neoplasm. For example, there is evidence for division of labour in neoplasms. A minority of cells sometimes will produce a public good, like an angiogenic factor that stimulates the growth of new blood vessels [ 38 ] or an invasion factor like a protease that allows other non-invasive cells to invade neighbouring tissues [ 39 ]. The existence of division of labour in neoplasms helps to resolve the paradox of why many cancers retain cells that terminally differentiate (non-stem cells). Such evolutionary dead-end cells can persist, via kin selection, if they provide a fitness advantage to their closely related stem cells, which they can potentially do through division of labour [ 40 ]. Resource allocation systems open up the possibility for cheaters to monopolize resources. The complexity of the insulin system [ 41 ] may be due to the need to regulate resource allocation and prevent cells from cheating. Dysregulation of the insulin system, in the form of diabetes, leads to an increased risk of cancer, thought to be due to a loss of growth control [ 41 ]. There is evidence that metformin, a diabetes drug, prevents cancer [ 42 ]. Similarly, Crespi & Semeniuk have argued that the complexity in the reproductive system is due to the difficulty of managing cooperation and cheating in parent\u2013offspring conflict [ 43 ]. Looking at multicellularity, we see that innovations in cooperation led to more opportunities for cheating, and cheating spurs the need for more complex and well-coordinated forms of cooperation and conflict management [ 9 ]. Cell cycle controls help regulate multicellular phenotypes but can be disrupted by cells that proliferate too quickly and exploit the body. These cheating opportunities then further spur the evolution of new innovations for cooperation and conflict control among cells [ 4 , 9 ]. Conflict management and policing of cheaters is done in part by tumour suppressor genes [ 4 ]. While there was a significant burst of new tumour suppressor genes that evolved at the dawn of multicellularity [ 44 ], new tumour suppressor genes continued to evolve afterwards [ 44 ]. For example, as elephantids evolved larger bodies, and thus more opportunities for cellular cheaters, they also evolved extra, modified copies of the TP53 tumour suppressor gene [ 45 , 46 ]. TP53 is a cheater detection and elimination gene that responds to DNA damage, viral and other stresses by either halting the cell cycle for DNA repair or eliminating the cell through apoptosis [ 47 ]. Researchers are now working on translating those elephant forms of TP53 into human cancer prevention and treatment. In general, we may pursue innovations in cancer prevention through reinforcing cellular cooperation or enhancing multicellular mechanisms of cheater detection and control. 6. The unexpected societal benefits of cheating Cheating often spurs on further innovation in human societies and technological systems as well. Disruption to systems sometimes facilitates reorganization and restructuring that improves the overall functioning of the system. For example, in computer security, some strain on the system in the form of small breaches can help test for, identify and lead to fixes that ultimately reduce vulnerabilities. In fact, the knowledge acquired from being hacked is so valuable that it is actively promoted in some areas of computer security research, where \u2018honeypots\u2019 are created to attract hackers and discover vulnerabilities of the computer systems so that they can be redesigned more effectively [ 48 ]. The same may be the case for the evolution of cancer suppression mechanisms, where the vulnerability of organisms to cancer has provided selective pressures for cheater suppression mechanisms. For example, exposure to solar radiation exposes vulnerabilities of organisms to cancer and selects for cancer suppression mechanisms such as the DNA damage response. Without this selective pressure that came from solar radiation during the evolution of life, organisms would probably be much more susceptible to cancer because their defense against cancer would not be as good. Thus, some testing and disruption of system function can sometimes be a good thing for systems that are actively growing and innovating because they may be less likely to retain vulnerabilities in their infrastructure as they get larger and more complex. More generally, innovations for cheating are not always a bad thing for the systems in which they happen. Sometimes disruptive innovations can actually create novel and even more effective or fit systems through enhancing viability, efficiency or in the case of multicellular bodies, fertility and attractiveness. Phenomena that look like cheating initially can sometimes give rise to important new phenotypes. Major phenotypic effects can result from small mutations in genes that regulate cell division, resource allocation and other genes involved in cellular cooperation [ 37 ]. Larger body size and the evolution of ornaments are some of the potential innovations that can happen when mutations occur in these genes. Like large body size, discussed earlier, sexual ornamentation is also arguably an innovation. The dramatic colouration and appendages can radically improve mating success, driven by a positive feedback mechanism of sexual selection [ 49 ]. Depending on the environment in which organisms find themselves, innovative traits like these may be a net benefit (e.g. because of enhanced reproductive opportunities) or a net cost (because of greater susceptibility to cancer or other diseases) [ 24 ]. This means that some phenomena that may initially look like cheating in the foundations of multicellularity may actually represent important innovations that can contribute to the reproductive success of the organism. This may also be the case in human groups, when phenomena that look like cheating within may end up being beneficial for the society in which they occur. There may be some interesting parallels between innovations in biology and some innovations that occur in scientific and political revolutions [ 50 ], when individuals challenge outdated or problematic rule systems and succeed in replacing them with new rules that better serve the society of which they are a part. 7. Pathogens evolve innovations that enhance their resilience at our expense Pathogens evolve innovations to evade host defenses and therapeutic interventions. Influenza viruses regularly evolve new envelop proteins that evade both our prior immunity and vaccinations, opening up new ecological space for themselves [ 51 ]. Pathogens often evolve and release novel enzymes that digest our drugs before they can act on the microbes [ 52 , 53 ]. These therapeutic resistance innovations rapidly spread through microbial populations to the point that entire classes of pharmaceuticals become effectively useless [ 52 ]. Microbes cooperate to spread these resistance innovations horizontally through microbial populations [ 54 , 55 ]. The mechanisms underlying the dissemination of these drug resistance innovations are diverse, including horizontal gene transfer through uptake of naked DNA (transformation), bacteriophage-mediated transfer (transduction), pili-mediated plasmid transfer (conjugation) and transfer of phage-like particles known as gene transfer agents (as reviewed in [ 55 , 56 ]). Microbes appear to have a wide range of mechanisms for sharing innovations in drug resistance, including even the production of nanotubes that enable sharing of molecules that confer temporary resistance to drugs without requiring integration and expression of new genes [ 57 ]. Many of these mechanisms involve the costly production and transmission of DNA and/or molecules, suggesting that these mechanisms are not simply a result of cells extracting resources from one another. Instead, these mechanisms may themselves be novel innovations for sharing among microbes. 8. Multicellular bodies must innovate to dynamically respond to pathogens The rapid evolution and innovation of microbes poses a challenge for the more slowly evolving multicellular hosts. All else being equal, we are caught on the losing side of a lopsided evolutionary arms race. A key organismal innovation in the history of that arms race with microbes was the evolution of the adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune system uses cell-level evolution, with recombination and hypermutation, as a mechanism of innovation to generate and refine detectors that can respond to pathogens that an organism has never seen before in its lifetime (or even in its evolutionary history). Furthermore, it does this on the same time scale as the evolution of the pathogens. In this way, multicellular organisms harnessed the power of evolution to innovate by keeping a population of cells (in the adaptive immune systems) actively evolving within it. The innovation of the adaptive immune system does not come without costs, as anybody with an autoimmune condition can testify. Autoimmune disease and organ transplantation rejection occur when the immune system's innovative capacities accidentally get turned against the host. This means that successful organ transplant requires the suppression or deception of the innovations in the adaptive immune system that have evolved to destroy foreign cells. Autoimmune disease can be understood as false-positive signal processing errors [ 58 ]. The adaptive immune system is, in part, a signal processor, evolved to distinguish disease agents from benign cells. This is difficult, because pathogens are constantly innovating ways to evade the immune system and appear to be benign cells. An autoimmune reaction is thus the false identification of normal tissue as disease agents. It is the price we pay for a system that can handle most of the diversity of pathogens in our environments. 9. Multicellular bodies use innovations from microbial partners Our immune systems are not just designed to prevent pathogen growth, but they also have an ancient and important role in supporting microbes that provide host benefits [ 59 ]. From the beginning, multicellular organisms have evolved, covered inside and out, with microbes. Some of the interactions between microbes and host cells involve cooperation, other interactions involve competition, sometimes with the very same microbes depending on their expression of virulence factors [ 60 ]. These microbes are involved in diverse ecological interactions with other microbes in and on us as well, cooperating with some and killing others. Some microbes benefit from their host's health, being supplied with food and shelter by their host. In this case, the microbes are under selective pressure to benefit their hosts, which can lead to the microbes providing nutritional benefits and protection from pathogens [ 60 ]. Close interactions with microbes have allowed us to use many of their innovations for our benefit. For example, many microbes allow us to extract nutritional value out of foods that we could not otherwise digest, expanding our ecological range. For example, Firmicutes, primarily Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae , partially digest complex carbohydrates (fibre), making sugars available to us that we could not access [ 61 ]. This fibre digestion capacity represents a microbial innovation that our bodies use to our benefit [ 60 ]. Microbes provide other nutritional benefits as well, including supplying vitamins and other limiting nutrients to their hosts [ 62 , 63 ]. Not only do we get nutritional benefits through using microbial innovations, we may get important immune benefits as well. Our microbiomes can contribute important pathogen defense functions, acting as a sort of auxiliary immune system. Microbes can prevent the invasion of some pathogens, either indirectly, by filling ecological niches, or directly, by killing pathogens through the release of antimicrobial molecules or viruses [ 64 , 65 ]. Most of our antibiotics have been derived from microbial products that evolved to kill other microbes [ 66 ]. Microbes can take up ecological niches in the mucins at the interface of our gut lining, preventing pathogenic microbes from invading our bodies [ 67 , 68 ]. Microbial occupation of ecological niches is an important contributor to infant nutrition and health as well. Breast milk contains oligosaccharides that cannot be digested by the infant without microbial assistance. The microbes that can process these oligosaccharides contribute to infant health by helping to preventing invasion of the intestinal lining by pathogenic microbes [ 69 ]. Most of our antibiotics have been derived from microbial products that evolved to kill other microbes [ 66 ]. Together, these facts suggest that multicellular organisms may be using the innovations of benign microbes to protect us from pathogenic microbes. Future innovations in human medicine may be based on harnessing microbial innovation. Stable microbial communities have evolved mechanisms to exclude invaders [ 70 ]. We may be able to cultivate more invasion-resistant microbiomes that have the capacity to dynamically respond to new threats from pathogens [ 71 \u2013 73 ]. Such microbial ecosystems have the advantage that they can continually evolve innovations for repelling or destroying pathogens. This may explain why multispecies ecological systems are an important part of many human societies and cultures in the form of fermented foods and beverages. As discussed earlier in this paper, the fermented tea known as kombucha is a symbiotic community of yeast and bacteria that engages in many cooperative interactions including resource sharing and defense against invading microbes [ 19 , 74 ]. Preliminary data collection in our laboratories suggests that actively evolving multi-species ecosystems like kombucha may have the capacity to combat human pathogens [ 75 ]. 10. Socially managing risk opens new frontiers In the North, a loner doesn't survive. Comment from a Koryak man [ 76 ]. Some environments are harsher than others. Risks such as an uncertain resource supply, potentially hazardous weather and predators are just some of the challenges that individuals face when they venture into new environments. How has life solved the problem of surviving and thriving in risky, difficult and uncertain environments? One way of dealing with risks like these is by teaming up with others to more effectively deal with the challenges and buffer individuals from risk. Before multicellularity evolved, every cell was a loner. One of the important innovations of multicellularity was enabling cells to better manage risks in the environment. Cells in multicellular bodies invest in an infrastructure that buffers them from the variability of the external environment. This involves a variety of sub-strategies including becoming larger than predators (risk reduction), stockpiling resources in the extracellular environment (risk retention) and creating resource delivery systems to send resources to cells that need them (risk transfer). Multicellularity is just one example of social risk management. Social insects also create structures to store resources and bacteria can produce biofilms that help protect them from toxins and invading species [ 77 ]. Like cellular societies, humans also must manage risks and we engage in complex risk management behaviours, many of which are highly social. For example, cooperative building of shelters, collective efforts towards pest elimination and even arrangements for resource sharing in case individuals encounter unexpected negative events occurs across human societies [ 14 , 77 , 78 ]. Widespread sharing of resources in particularly harsh environments is a pattern seen across many small-scale societies [ 77 ], including the Koryak who live in very cold conditions in far-east Russia [ 76 ] (quoted at the beginning of this section). These social risk management strategies are important cooperative innovations, but as with other cooperative innovations they can open up the potential for cheating. Indeed, many societies have implicit and explicit rules that help prevent cheating in these social risk management strategies including reputational mechanisms and strong cultural norms of behaviour that help enforce behaviours that provide risk management benefits to the group [ 77 , 78 ]. There are some interesting parallels between the risk management strategies employed by human societies and those used in cellular societies. For example, human shelter building is similar to multicellular bodies creating an external protective cell layer or microbes producing biofilms. Resource storage and group defense are other strategies used both by human societies and cellular societies that help to buffer risk from environmental volatility and invasion, respectively. In human societies, engineered solutions to our problems produce a form of guided variation. That guided variation and cultural transmission of innovations lead to similar dynamics as natural selection in cellular societies, but with biased exploration of possibilities and biased transmission [ 79 \u2013 81 ]. Humans have novel innovations for transmitting information that allow us to share many things, including strategies for dealing with risky and uncertain environments [ 82 ]. Generally speaking, mechanisms of inheritance allow the transmission of new innovations from one individual to another. In evolutionary theory, this includes mechanisms of genetic inheritance in sexual and asexual reproduction as well as mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer, common in bacteria [ 55 ]. But in human groups, transmission mechanisms for innovations include oral traditions, the written word/printing press and modern information sharing technologies including the Internet. The ability to share information and technologies\u2014our innovations for sharing innovations\u2014may have played an important role in our ability to colonize environments around the globe, some of which would have been otherwise uninhabitable [ 15 , 81 ]. This capacity to share information may make humans uniquely well suited for responding flexibly to challenges. We have the ability to learn from others who may have previously encountered similar risks, and even to anticipate future risks and innovate new risk-management strategies [ 82 ]. This capacity to dynamically manage risks and innovate may have been an important contributor to humans colonizing much of the Earth including many harsh and marginal environments [ 43 , 48 ] and might, therefore, also be important to our capacity to manage future challenges through innovation. 11. Conclusion Innovations in cooperation and cheating have shaped cellular societies. The evolution of multicellularity is essentially the coming together of five forms of cellular cooperation: inhibition of proliferation, controlled cell death, division of labour, resource allocation and creation/maintenance of the extracellular environment. These forms of cooperation, when brought together, enable major innovation in the forms that life can take: allowing for the diversity of multicellular life forms we see today. Multicellularity is threatened when cells within the body cheat on these foundations of multicellular cooperation, innovating through mutation and other genetic changes that can lead to cancer. Multicellular bodies are also threatened by pathogens that can exploit the cooperative interactions occurring within multicellular bodies. In order to counter this threat, many organisms (us included) have evolved an adaptive immune system that can respond rapidly to microbial innovation. We also leverage relationships with rapidly evolving microbial ecosystems that can provide benefits for us, for example, protecting us from pathogens and helping us extract nutrients from the food that we eat. Examining how cellular societies such as multicellular bodies and the microbiome have leveraged innovations leads to several insights that may apply to human societies as well. First, working from evolutionary theory, we can see that innovation is more likely to arise and be disseminated in large and diverse communities where new variants can arise and increase in frequency (as with the process of natural selection itself). Second, cultivating cooperation with partners who can rapidly and effectively innovate is important for large entities like multicellular bodies that evolve more slowly than the entities that threaten them (e.g. cancer cells and pathogens). And third, managing risk socially (as multicellular bodies do) can facilitate survival in challenging environments where individuals could not survive on their own, making exploration of frontiers more viable than is possible when individuals strike out on their own. These insights can inform new innovations in human health and medicine, including the translation of cheater detection and control mechanisms from other systems (e.g. translating metformin from diabetes to cancer) or even from other organisms (e.g. elephant TP53 for human cancer prevention). By understanding innovations in cooperation and cheating that occur in cellular societies, we can more effectively promote and protect the cellular cooperation that makes us viable multicellular organisms.

George Gaylord Simpson modified this to an adaptive, phenotypic landscape in 1944 and since then evolutionary spaces have played an important role in evolutionary theory through fitness and adaptive landscapes, phenotypic and functional trait spaces, morphospaces and related concepts. Although the topology of such spaces is highly variable, from locally Euclidean to pre-topological, evolutionary change has often been interpreted as a search through a pre-existing space of possibilities, with novelty arising by accessing previously inaccessible or difficult to reach regions of a space. Here I discuss the nature of evolutionary novelty and innovation within the context of evolutionary spaces, and argue that the primacy of search as a conceptual metaphor ignores the generation of new spaces as well as other changes that have played important evolutionary roles. This article is part of the themed issue \u2018Process and pattern in innovations from cells to societies\u2019. 1. Introduction Wright introduced evolutionary spaces in 1932 [ 1 ] and the metaphor has been employed by evolutionary biologists ever since, with spaces representing an array of combinatoric possibilities, whether they are defined by genes or genomes, morphology, function or other traits. These spaces are generally visualized as scalar fields of multiple, independent biological variables with some having a dependent variable representing fitness, adaptation, complexity or performance. Adaptive landscapes have been widely employed to describe the trajectories of lineages while morphospaces have been employed by paleontologists seeking to understand the distribution of form within clades. Waddington's introduction of the epigenetic landscape extended Wright's metaphor to development [ 2 ]. Evolutionary spaces have also been adopted in social sciences, including economics [ 3 ]. In some cases, the relationship between spaces has received considerable attention, as with genotype\u2013phenotype mapping in small RNAs [ 4 , 5 ] and in empirical studies [ 6 , 7 ]. In other cases, the relationship between different spaces is not well established. Many aspects of evolutionary spaces have been recently reviewed [ 8 \u2013 12 ] and Dawkins devoted a book to the subject [ 13 ]. Spaces have played a role in conceptualizing evolutionary novelty since the work of Simpson, however, recent insights from comparative developmental biology and from the fossil record suggest a need to re-examine the relationship between spaces and novelty. This contribution addresses the relationship between these spaces of combinatoric possibility and evolutionary novelty and innovation, and particularly how the topology (or inferred topology) of spaces may influence evolutionary dynamics. Evolutionary novelty has been described as a process of search for combinations of attributes that increase fitness. This perspective assumes that the spaces exist rather than being constructed by organisms, that search is a meaningful driver of novelty, and that novelty occurs within a pre-defined space rather than by extensions to the space or the generation of new spaces. There are substantial reasons for doubting each of these assumptions. This paper considers the topology of novelty and innovation, some of the ways in which evolutionary spaces may evolve as a consequence of novelty, and the relative importance of search versus construction in generating novelty and innovation. 2. Novelty versus innovation The terms novelty, innovation and, in technology, invention are often used interchangeably and without clear definitions. This is unfortunate, as a critical question in evolutionary biology is whether novelty differs from traditional processes of adaptation [ 14 \u2013 17 ]. Following Schumpeter [ 18 ], I distinguish novelty (invention for Schumpeter) from innovation [ 14 ]. Comparative developmental studies of animals have revealed unexpectedly deep homologies in genes and mechanisms and established that adaptive evolution is not necessarily the sole path to the developmental changes that generate phenotypic novelties [ 15 , 19 , 20 ]. Novelty reflects the formation of newly individuated characters, features of the organism which were not present in ancestral species. This definition has emerged from a considerable body of study among biologists [ 15 \u2013 17 , 21 , 22 ]. Novel characters in turn may have many different character states: a feather is a novel character but the many different sorts of feathers represent alternative character states, but not novelties [ 15 ], just as a new gene may have many different alleles. This definition is broad enough to encompass novelties at other levels, for example, the origin of new regulatory mechanisms or behavioural patterns, as well as novel morphologies. From this conceptual framework, major evolutionary transitions involving the formation of new evolutionary individuals [ 23 ], such as the eukaryotic cell, are extreme cases of novelties. Mayr [ 24 ] and Simpson [ 25 ] viewed novelties as a new structure with a new function responding to ecological opportunities, as with Simpson's discussions of adaptive radiations [ 26 ]. Thus, any suggestion of a disconnect between the origin of novelties and their success would likely have struck them as odd, or even bizarre. But evidence from fossils shows that new morphological features often arise long before they become ecologically or evolutionarily significant (macroevolutionary lags) [ 14 ]. For example, grasses originated and diversified into their major clades at least 25 million years before grasslands became widespread [ 27 ]. In this case the presence of phytoliths (silica bodies unique to grasses) in sediments during the lag interval demonstrate that grasses were present, but were ecologically insignificant. These lags are not cases of failure of the fossil record, but instances where novelty has occurred but with little ecological impact (since palaeontologists commonly track taxic diversity rather than ecological abundance, the number of cases of macroevolutionary lags is probably underestimated). Innovation occurs when a novelty has sufficient ecological or evolutionary impact that removing the node represented by that taxa from an ecological network (not simply a food web) would noticeably impact the structure or functioning of the network. In some cases novelties may coincide with innovation, but lags show that novelty does not necessarily lead immediately to innovation. Further support for this distinction between novelty and innovation comes from quantitative studies of morphospaces, which have shown that novelties that define a new clade generally define the boundaries of the morphospace, with morphologic disparity exceeding taxonomic diversity. Subsequent adaptive evolution fills in the space [ 9 , 28 ]. Although these definitions differ from those adopted in this collection [ 29 ] and elsewhere (e.g. [ 30 ]), they are consistent with an ongoing research program. 3. Evolutionary spaces: a bestiary In 1879 Lewis Carroll published \u2018A new Puzzle\u2019 in which two words had to be linked by a string of other words, each differing by a single letter [ 31 ] (nonsense four-letter words were excluded). Carroll used the example of head to tail through head\u2013heal\u2013teal\u2013tell\u2013tall\u2013tail. Since the length of the word is fixed and a single letter changes at each step, the puzzle defines a space of 26 4 or 456 979 possible four-letter strings. Wright's genotype spaces use the same logic as Carroll's puzzle. Wright examined networks of genotypes or gene combinations as a tool to convey his quantitative work to a broader biological audience (although Provine noted that over his career Wright used fitness spaces in three mutually incompatible ways [ 32 ]). Wright's network of gene combinations represents a gene or genotype space, but the addition of fitness of different gene combinations as a dependent variable converted the space into a surface or landscape. Dobzhansky [ 33 ] immediately extended Wright's approach by envisioning multiple niches within a single space [ 10 ]. Simpson converted fitness landscapes into adaptive landscapes [ 34 ], deploying them in support of his view of the relationships between microevolutionary process and macroevolutionary patterns, including the formation of new higher taxa through invasion of new adaptive zones. Despite critiques [ 35 ], the Wright, Dobzhansky and Simpsonian landscapes have proven quite generative (see papers in [ 8 ]). Initial work on two- and three-dimensional landscapes assumed that selection would drive populations to adaptive peaks, although in landscapes with multiple peaks populations might find themselves stranded on local optima with no path to higher peaks. Wright recognized that actual landscapes were highly multi-dimensional, and later work suggested that multi-dimensionality turns peaks and valleys into large flat surfaces, punctuated with holes with very low fitness and that populations might often move along ridges in multi-dimensional space [ 36 ]. The impact of epistatic effects was examined in the N\u2013K model, which generalized Wright's models and showed that high degrees of epistasis produce very rugged landscapes and led to the description of novelty as the \u2018adjacent possible\u2019 [ 37 , 38 ]. Research on empirical landscapes has explored how their topologies influence the course of evolution [ 39 , 40 ]. Maynard Smith recalled Carroll's puzzle when he described a protein space in which the letters represent different amino acids [ 41 ]. He employed the protein space model to illustrate how one gene can change into another and suggested that functional proteins were connected by a path consisting of single base pair changes, each of which produced a functional protein. Thus, embedded within the protein space were networks of functional proteins. Maynard Smith's straightforward protein space was extended to the space of folded structures that can be generated from repeats of the helix\u2013loop\u2013helix\u2013loop motif [ 42 ]; known repeat proteins occupy only a small part of the space. The peaks in these spaces represent high fitness or adaptation, but Waddington inverted the model in his epigenetic landscapes to show differentiating cells falling into basins of attraction. This was part of his critique of an over-reliance on fitness in the Modern Synthesis [ 2 , 43 , 44 ]. Waddington's landscape was highly influential, particularly in studies of cellular differentiation (e.g. [ 45 ]) and led to a variety of developmental spaces [ 46 \u2013 48 ]. Spaces of gene regulatory networks (GRNs), the mechanistic basis of development, have been described as a regulatory space, as discussed further below. Although the idea of a space of morphologies was inherent in Simpson's work, quantitative analysis of morphology was equally influenced by the pioneering grid deformations of D'Arcy Thompson [ 49 \u2013 51 ]. These were not fully articulated until Raup's work on logarithmically coiled organisms [ 52 , 53 ] used three coiling parameters to define a combinatoric space of morphologic possibilities. Raup investigated what part of the space had been occupied by molluscs and brachiopods. One useful feature of this theoretical morphospace was that it allows examination of morphologies that do not exist. Empirical morphospaces are defined by measurements of fossil or living taxa [ 54 , 55 ]. Projection of phylogenetic trees into morphospaces (to produce a \u2018phylomorphospace\u2019) revealed how clades evolved within a morphospace over time. Although morphospaces can be used for closely related taxa, they are most commonly employed by paleontologists studying larger, but morphologically similar clades; the need for some similar (homologous) characters limits the morphologic breadth which can be studied. The metaphor of spaces has been applied in other biological contexts, not always explicitly connected to genotype spaces. Examples include a skeletal design space used to explore the variety of skeletal elements used in different animal clades [ 56 , 57 ]; the range of ecological strategies adopted by animals in an ecospace [ 58 ]; and spaces have been employed to examine the relationship between phenotype and function, whether at the biochemical level [ 59 ] or organismal phenotype [ 60 ]. Changes in disparity associated with Phanerozoic mass extinctions defined an extinction space to study the morphological impact of different events [ 61 ]. Not all of the spaces described here are also landscapes, either because no fitness value is included (morphospaces, ecospace, some trait spaces), or because the entities are discontinuous and so no landscape is possible (e.g. skeleton space) ( table 1 ). Some of these are special cases of a phenotypic space, and some might argue that all should reduce to a genotype space. As discussed below, emergent features in developmental, morphologic, ecologic and functional spaces inhibit mapping these to genotype space. View this table: View popup Table 1. Features of evolutionary spaces. Protein spaces have been viewed as the mapping from a sequence space, but in a broader context both protein and developmental spaces are intermediaries between genetic and phenotypic spaces, with novelties and innovations largely occurring in different types of spaces Most of the spaces discussed here are variants of phenotypic spaces. Wagner-reg and Wagner-met are the regulatory and metabolic spaces described in Wagner [ 62 ]. In general, morphospaces are not landscapes, but see McGhee [ 11 ] for a discussion of morphospaces as adaptive landscapes. \u2018Variable\u2019 indicates that topology of the space or involvement in novelty or innovation may vary depending on the taxonomic breadth under study. Evolutionary spaces have been deployed in other contexts. For example, fitness landscapes and particularly the Kauffman\u2013Levin N\u2013K landscapes spread to the social sciences (reviewed in [ 3 , 63 ]). Raup's theoretical morphospace and general principles of network architecture were used to generate a network morphospace spanning food webs to neural and electrical circuits [ 64 ]. This space was used to examine common network properties and to evaluate unexplored architectures. In development economics, a product space shows the products produced in different countries and has been used to argue that economic development is driven by moving into products adjacent to those already produced in a country [ 65 ]. 4. Topology The folding of small RNA molecules has provided a powerful tool for understanding evolutionary topology, and particularly the relationship between the genotype (the RNA sequence) and the three-dimensional structure produced by folding of the RNA sequence (the phenotype). Only a few two-dimensional structures will have the lowest possible free energy, so mapping an RNA sequence into a two-dimensional structure is relatively straightforward. In this model a sequence 100 nucleotides long will be adjacent to 300 other sequences which could be reached by a single-nucleotide change so the total sequence space is 10 60 . Since many changes to a sequence will not generate a change in the folded structures, there will be large networks of effectively neutral changes. Single base-pair changes to the RNA sequence may trace a path through the sequence space, but single base-pair changes can also produce very different optimal two-dimensional structures. If different two-dimensional structures are taken as novelties the critical point is that some random networks will have many adjacencies to other random networks, leading to the expectation that shifting between the two folded structures represented by different networks should be relatively easy (think of the boundary between France and Germany\u2014a step out of France is likely to land in Germany). By contrast, other networks will be relatively isolated, with few adjacencies to other neutral networks (Monaco is surrounded by France, but few steps out of France would land in Monaco; the converse is not true, as any step out of Monaco necessarily lands in France) [ 4 ]. The novel structures represented by the isolated networks will be relatively inaccessible, but for this example it is the topology of the sequence space that determines the accessibility of the phenotypic novelties. Thus, accessibility is not necessarily the same as distance (the distance may be short but if the probability of the change is low the new form has low accessibility). Studies of this RNA sequence model have shown that there is not necessarily an easy path through sequence space between any two phenotypes [ 4 , 5 , 66 ], but that alternative shapes may be only a few mutations away in any sequence. Wagner extended the concept of genotype spaces to gene regulation with a regulatory genotype space containing the set of all possible circuit topologies of a given size [ 62 , 67 ]. Two circuits are neighbours in such a space if they differ in one regulatory interaction. As with many spaces, many regulatory circuits are expected to produce the same pattern of gene expression, although single changes might produce novel regulatory patterns. This is a microevolutionary model for novelty, driven by search through a sequence space (or its equivalent). The concept of distance turns out to be critical in evaluating the topology of evolutionary spaces. We live in a world of three spatial and one time dimension, with the spatial dimensions being regular and symmetric. Such Euclidean spaces are special cases of metric spaces, a vector space where the dimensions of the space are orthogonal and distances can be computed among all elements. The RNA folding space is not Euclidean because while adjacent neutral networks may be in the same neighbourhood, no meaningful distance can be computed between them, just as no meaningful distance can be computed between a mushroom and a coffee cup. Non-Euclidean spaces range from metric spaces where distances can be measured but dimensions may not be orthogonal, to topological spaces where objects may be near or adjacent, but distances cannot be quantified. In pre-topological spaces objects may be in a neighbourhood, but the space is unbounded (in contrast to the bounded Euclidean, metric and topological spaces). For RNA the sequence space is Euclidean but the two-dimensional phenotype space is a pre-topological space. A set is an unbounded space where even the concept of a neighbourhood does not apply. We tend to apply \u2018Euclidean intuitions\u2019 [ 68 ] without inquiring into whether the space is, in fact, Euclidean. For example, Raup's shell coiling model that introduced morphospaces is non-Euclidean [ 69 ]. Moreover, apparent distances computed in morphospaces may be misleading where constraints on variation limit the range of possible morphotypes [ 70 ]. The evolutionary spaces described above include a range of topologies ( table 1 ), although many spaces are often assumed to be at least metric, if not Euclidean [ 4 , 5 , 68 , 71 ]. A substantial challenge in evolutionary biology, and one that has achieved too little attention, is adjusting our Euclidean intuitions to the evolutionary dynamics in spaces of different topologies. 5. Topology of evolution The enduring interest in evolutionary spaces reflects the fact that while some spaces are a description of empirical patterns, all of the spaces provide useful intuitions about the evolutionary process (which is why Wright introduced genotypic spaces). This section addresses the relationships and possible discontinuities between spaces, and then elaborates on the difference between adaptive searches within an existing space and the construction of new spaces. One might argue that all spaces are ultimately derived from a vast sequence space and mappings from that into a phenotypic space. But the existence of discontinuities between spaces is implicit in Wagner's distinction between macromolecular, regulatory and metabolic spaces. Two factors reveal the extent of discontinuities: the RNA folding model only includes two-dimensional structures because the three-dimensional folding is not predictable. In general, mapping from sequence space to other spaces will be limited by alternative minimal energy configurations and the intercession of accessory proteins and other factors. Furthermore, for multicellular forms phenotypes reflect cellular, mechanical and environmental inputs [ 72 ] as well as sequence. Environmental factors may have particularly important feedbacks in developmental processes. Genome sequencing has shown that variations in gene number or genome size are largely unrelated to developmental or phenotypic complexity. Since roughly the same number of genes (18 000 to 20 000) is needed to make any animal, the complexity of animals reflects not variation in sequence space but in the regulatory interactions that enable development. Thus, the various spaces are not necessarily decomposable to a sequence space. Wright seems to have recognized this in distinguishing between genetic (sequence) and genotypic spaces. While sequence is a critical input to phenotypic spaces, sequence is increasingly disconnected as one progresses down the list of spaces in table 1 . In the RNA folding model the sequence space is defined by the length of the sequence, movement through the space is via single base changes and the phenotype (the folded state) is predictable from the sequence space. As noted, search in the Euclidean sequence space can produce novel forms in the phenotypic pre-topology space. The RNA model has been extended to regulatory and metabolic networks [ 62 , 73 ]. A combinatoric space of regulatory circuits defines a regulatory space, with neighbouring circuits differing by one interaction, as with the spaces described earlier. The distance in such a space would be the number of differences in non-zero regulatory interactions, and Wagner has argued that as with the RNA genotype space, many regulatory circuits would produce the same gene expression pattern, forming a vast network of viable regulatory circuits (and that the same principles apply to metabolic networks). Thus sequence, protein and Wagner's regulatory spaces are defined a priori and exist in what Wagner describes as \u2018\u2026the timeless eternal realm of nature's libraries\u2019 [74, p. 176]. Novelty arises through single mutations moving a circuit from one phenotype to an adjacent but novel phenotype; in other words, search through a network. Empirical examples of search through evolutionary spaces include functional analysis of a variety of labrid fish jaw structures to show that they are equivalent, despite their morphological variety [ 60 ]. The diverse topologies of myogenic GRNs across bilaterians [ 75 ] demonstrate that substantial changes in GRN architecture can occur while generating the same outcome (a phenomenon known as developmental systems drift [ 76 ]). Both cases illustrate the many to one mapping between genotype and phenotype spaces (broadly defined), and that novelties at one level do not necessarily generate novelties at another level. Evolution via search in a metric or Euclidean space can lead to novelty in the relevant phenotypic space, but is more likely to lead to adaptive change rather than novelty as defined previously. The evolutionary operator in these models is a single-nucleotide or amino acid change, but even in microbial systems this is far too limited. In principle, evolutionary spaces could change in three ways in addition to search or diffusion: growth or extension of existing spaces via new axes, the generation of new operators for diffusion within an existing space and the construction of new spaces. Real sequence spaces are not the Hamming spaces (of equal length) envisioned in the RNA model, but of variable length due to nucleotide deletions, insertions and frame-shift mutations, new genes may be assembled by formation of new domains or rearrangement of existing domains, and regulatory spaces can change via addition or deletion of transcription factor binding sites. Such changes will impact the dimensionality of these vast spaces. New evolutionary operators change patterns of search within a space, potentially changing the accessibility of potential novelties. Examples of new operators include alternative splicing and horizontal gene transfer. Surveys of protein evolution have established the importance of many factors beyond those captured by a protein space, such as the position of the gene within the genome and pleiotropic effects such as a protein's position within a biological network or its dispensability [ 77 ]. Evolutionary novelties and innovations have also resulted in the construction of new evolutionary spaces. New spaces involve a combination of characters which are partly or wholly non-homologous with characters in other spaces. This may be most obvious in phenotypic spaces where unique character combinations define distinctive morphologies. The appearance of such new spaces may be abrupt, as with the origin of icthyosaus during the early Triassic (about 250 million years ago (Ma)), or gradual, as with the appearance of early birds during the Mesozoic. Cognitive expansion in social learning also appears to involve the construction of new spaces [ 78 ]. The origin of animals illustrates the limitations of relying on a search rather than a construction-based view of novelty and innovation. The closest living relatives of Metazoa are choanoflagellates and then, slightly more distant, filastreans. Molecular clock studies indicate that the origin of Metazoa occurred approximately 780 Ma although animals do not appear in the fossil record until approximately 560 Ma with the Cambrian Explosion of animal life beginning after 541 Ma [ 79 , 80 ] . Although some specific genes are related, animal genomes are about two times larger than their ancestors; many proteins include novel domains or arrangements of domains [ 81 ]; regulatory networks have evolved through the construction of new types of circuits [ 19 , 82 ]; and the range of operators that change regulatory interactions has expanded, as with co-option of subcircuits within a GRN. Developmental spaces are discontinuous because of the introduction of the means of cellular coordination, the introduction of distal enhancers near the origin of Metazoa [ 83 ], and the generation of entirely novel developmental spaces via signalling pathways and microRNAs. These novelties complicate the mapping from genotype through development to phenotype. Although it is true that these reside in the DNA sequence, their activities are emergent phenomena that depend upon interactions with other regulatory elements, various proteins and environmental factors. The phenotypic or morphospaces that emerged during the Cambrian Explosion are highly discontinuous [ 79 ] and, despite highly conserved genes, the developmental processes leading to trilobites or crinoids are vastly different. This is not to say that we cannot calculate a phylogenetic distance between animals and their ancestors; that is easily done with molecular, genomic or morphologic data. But such phylogenetic distance estimates largely represent acquisition of new shared, derived characters, many of them novelties, associated with the origins of metazoan clades. Evolutionary spaces have provided a powerful and enduring metaphor for exploring evolutionary dynamics. However, the application of these spaces to novelty and innovation has been hampered by a failure to distinguish novelty from innovation, and a reliance upon search through existing spaces as the dominant metaphor. Empirical evidence as well as theoretical considerations suggest that evolutionary spaces have evolved through the construction of novelties and innovations. Acknowledging the importance of the extension, modification and generation of new spaces as a key component of novelty does not diminish the importance of search. Rather, search involves the exploration of viable combinatoric solutions once a space has been generated. Thus, any examination of the evolutionary topology of innovation must necessarily address the macroevolutionary dimension of construction of new spaces as well as the microevolutionary aspects of search. The approach I advocate here is similar to a recent simulation of increases in cultural tools. This model identified four different types of innovation, including \u2018main-branch tools\u2019 that construct a niche for the associated expansion of toolkits, and recombination of existing tools [ 84 ]. Although that study did not explicitly invoke evolutionary spaces, the main-branch tools represent the generation of a novel space, while the toolkit innovations are a search through the space (with the interesting caveat that there is often an order in which new tools may be acquired, as is also the case in biology [ 85 ]). 6. Discussion The nature of evolutionary spaces is relevant for considerations of novelty and innovation for three reasons. First, while if one considers similar morphologies the appropriate phenotype space may be (locally) Euclidean, as the scope of the morphologies expands the nature of the space becomes progressively less defined until even the concept of a neighbourhood disappears (in mathematical terms, large phenotypic spaces are manifolds). Second, while some evolutionary spaces, particularly sequence spaces, exist a priori , others are constructed through evolution, thus spaces evolve, not just the entities which occupy them. This leads to the third point: although novelty and innovation have been described as search or diffusion through evolutionary spaces, they also generate new evolutionary spaces. Thus, a critical question for any consideration of the topology of evolution is: Do different types of novelties and innovations occur in spaces with different topologies? Or, to put it a different way: Do different types of spaces allow, or facilitate, different types of novelties or innovation? Some types of spaces, particularly phenotypic, morphometric, trait and functional spaces, may be available but ecologically or environmentally precluded. In other words, particular traits or states are genetically or developmentally accessible but cannot survive (and thus would not be observed). Separating novelty from innovation acknowledges that the former may occur in these spaces without necessarily leading to sufficient ecological impact to generate innovation. Conversely, extinction, particularly mass extinctions, have eliminated many developmental, phenotypic, trait and functional spaces, and morphospaces through the loss of genetic and developmental potential, as with the disappearance of trilobites [ 86 ]. Whether this has simply rendered the spaces inaccessible or truly caused their disappearance is an interesting issue for future work. The ubiquity of phenotypic convergence between phylogenetically independent lineages has led some authors to offer this as evidence for the limited potential of evolution [ 11 , 87 , 88 ]. In biology, culture and technology there are many examples of multiple origins of the same or similar traits: beavers evolved once in the time of dinosaurs [ 89 ] and again more recently, complex states evolved multiple times [ 90 ] and there are many examples of repeated evolution in science and technology [ 91 ]. Experimental evolutionary studies of microbes [ 92 , 93 ] and protein sequences of fish anti-freeze [ 94 ] exhibit similar patterns of convergent evolution (see review of biological convergence in [ 95 ]). As McGhee put it \u2018\u2026the number of evolutionary pathways available to life is not endless, but is instead quite limited\u2019 [ 95 , p. 94], which has contributed arguments over the relative importance of contingency and determinism in evolution [ 96 , 97 ]. McGhee's work has examined adaptive and morphospaces in particular, although I know of no systematic comparison of the scope of convergence across different evolutionary spaces. Some convergence reflects physical requirements, as with the similarities between tuna, dolphins and some marine reptiles. But the limitations on evolution may be more apparent than real, reflecting search within an existing space, rather than the generation of new spaces. Where the genotype to phenotype mapping is straightforward, as in the case of the RNA example discussed several times, search is an appropriate approach to understanding the discovery of novel functions. In cases where the mapping is more complex, as with development in multicellular organisms or in cultural and technological domains, understanding how the introduction of new operators or the generation of new spaces occurs may be a more fruitful approach. These considerations suggest that evolvability generated by novelties may be closely related to the ability to generate these new operators or new spaces. Evolution as the cumulative effect of small genetic changes is the essence of microevolution. The classic model of search through genotypic and phenotypic spaces, whether driven by selection or drift through neutral networks, reflects such a viewpoint. In contrast, the generation of new operators as well as the generation of new evolutionary spaces reflects macroevolutionary change. Much of the macroevolutionary theory generated by palaeontologists over the past few decades focuses on changing distributions of species and clades and documentation of discontinuities between micro- and macroevolution [ 98 \u2013 100 ]. The wealth of new comparative information on developmental mechanisms has generated renewed interest in distinct, macroevolutionary sources of variation [ 15 , 19 , 101 , 102 ]. 7. Future directions The metaphor of evolutionary spaces has been widely adopted across biology and has penetrated other fields. Despite some well-founded criticisms this metaphor seems unlikely to disappear. Evolutionary landscapes provide insights into patterns of evolutionary transition at different scales and may be particularly useful in developing models of novelty and innovation. Evolutionary novelties, as defined here, may be associated with search or extension via new axes of existing spaces, the generation of new operators for diffusion and the construction of new spaces. This framework raises questions for further work: Can we express the expansion of developmental regulatory controls for animals in a developmental space? Are there specific cases where both the construction or expansion of spaces can be examined along with search through a space? Do different types of novelties or innovations arise when new spaces are constructed versus those that arise from search? Since the framework developed here rejects claims that spaces are universal, how have spaces changed over time, whether within a clade or more generally? Does the topology of a space influence the types of evolutionary change that can occur?

Exit and tool use before and after first invention of L4 solution in four groups. The mid-point shows the first L4 success (O = older child model; G = existing group member). Exits: red = ramp; blue = trapdoor; green = lift. Tools: yellow = combine tool; dark green = unfold tool, no hook; light green = unfold tool with effective hook added. Numbers distinguish responses, sometimes multiple, by different children. Numbers in bold indicate a first success. (b) Effects of major ecological challenge With L1\u2013L3 unavailable, one child in group PA succeeded at L4 by inventing an unfold hook tool as described in the previous section (see electronic supplementary material, table S8 for descriptives). However, in this case, despite an average of 2.07 children watching each of this child's successes, none adopted the technique. There were also successes at the L5 trapdoor through one child applying a long combine tool and another child (the same individual who had previously solved L4) later using an unfold tool with hook, but these also did not spread to become shared innovations in the group, despite the first success being watched by nine children and successes being viewed on average by 2.67 children. In contrast no success occurred at L4 or L5 in 2 h of exposure in group PM. Accordingly the plan outlined above was activated to introduce two older models to this group, one of whom extended the unfold hook tool and used it to open the L4 ramp exit. One younger child then repeated this to open the ramp exit, but also went on to apply this tool to open the trapdoor, after which a further child did so ( figure 8 ). Thus as in the advanced models intervention with L1\u2013L4 in place described in section (a) above, these children employed a cumulatively built technique that later acquired the status of a shared innovation. Attempting the challenging use of this tool, even if without success, spread amongst a further seven children on ramp and trapdoor, but not the other exits ( N hook uses prior to first success = 2, N hook uses after first success = 41; two-tailed binomial test: p < 0.001) ( figure 8 ; and see electronic supplementary material, figure S2 for an overview of these results). Given these results it is not surprising that the L4-only control group (L4C) had achieved no success at L4 (section 7(b) above). However, despite the lack of success it is instructive to examine the quality of attempts focused at L4 in the same way as in Phase A, but here focusing only on PA and PM. The ratio of actions on exits versus manipulating the egg was as low as 4 : 109 in L4C, whereas in PA and PM it was much higher, at 33 : 36 and 59 : 56 respectively. Combining the latter two similar results, the ratio was significantly higher (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.001 two-tailed) in these groups that had experienced the whole hierarchically structured SW in the earlier sessions S1\u2013S4, and provided evidence of cumulative cultural progress in that period. However, equivalent ratios expressed at the level of individual children failed to achieve significance: L4C, 2:12; PA/PM, 13:19; p = 0.076. This makes the interpretation of these contrasts complicated yet instructive, and we return to them in the discussion below. Results of Phase B, (a) and (b) are summarized in electronic supplementary material, table S2 using the same framework distinguishing predictions and associated results as in Phase A. 10. Discussion Introducing a set of novel experiments in the field of cumulative culture, we have described a cluster of the findings most relevant to the present theme issue of this journal. As we noted in our introductory review, the literature addressing this topic through experiments remains limited, especially with children. The latter have focused on cumulative social learning, but either omitted the wider cultural diffusion necessary to identify \u2018innovation\u2019 as here defined [ 26 , 46 , 50 ], or employed a task that necessarily required cumulative steps for success, constraining inferences about the importance of cumulation in progressive achievements [ 47 ], or offered a task in which children could obtain no rewards other than transferring maximal quantities of rice between two containers, as an experimenter encouraged them to attempt [ 48 ]. Children showed little or no evidence of cumulative culture in the latter experiment; however, most could already spontaneously recognize adequate ways of transferring rice from the start. Accordingly we suggest that through our experiment we have obtained some of the first experimental evidence that (limited) capacities for cumulative cultural progress are already developing in young children. This necessarily required the dual elements of invention and social learning, leading to shared innovations, some of which were cumulatively built as progress was made in achievements at higher and more challenging (and more rewarding) levels in our Small World environment. However, our study also emphasizes the challenges of drawing inferences about these processes within the interpretive complexities of cumulative cultural experiments. We discuss these before focusing on particular implications of our results. (a) Defining and identifying invention, innovation, social learning and cumulative cultural change: challenges for cultural diffusion experiments The emergence of shared innovations requires the prior emergence of a novel element , which is how we have here defined an invention . For objective clarity we treated each first success at opening a specific exit among the 16 available in the SW as such an invention, and at successive levels in the SW these required the invention of different kinds of tool use and novelties in how to apply them to exits familiar from other levels (as in fashioning longer tools for L3 and hook tools for L4). We think this a satisfactory approach insofar as the term \u2018invention\u2019 is thus technically and clearly defined in the context of our study, and the present journal issue [ 11 ]. However, calling actions like using a finger to press down the trapdoor at L1 \u2018invention\u2019 may seem to over-dignify it in comparison with the word's everyday meaning and cultural instances like the invention of light bulbs and cyclotrons. What we may call \u2018inventions\u2019 (or innovations) vary in the size of the \u2018leap\u2019 from what existed before, to what exists after, the invention, and accordingly perhaps the cognitive capacity required [ 56 , 58 ]. Such contrasts surely exist within our study: for example, compare the L1 finger-push on the trapdoor with the inventive fashioning of a hook tool and its use to catch a loop on the ramp door and pull it down at L4. For the moment we simply acknowledge this issue, but perhaps in future, progress may be made in distinguishing levels or kinds of inventions, the nature of the cognitive gap between them and the nature of the mental leap needed to bridge the gap. Identifying social learning in the present experimental context is also not straightforward. Robust experiments can be designed to test for social learning, by seeding alternative actions in models viewed by others in dyadic or diffusion designs, and/or by adding asocial controls [ 26 \u2013 28 ]. But in such instances, the experimenters contribute the \u2018inventions\u2019, whereas to test for cumulative culture in the round, we need to allow the participants themselves to contribute inventions as well as social learning. Inevitably this removes an element of experimental control and necessitates reliance on more correlational or circumstantial evidence about whether social learning picks up on the invention to transform it into a shared innovation. These interpretive challenges are further compounded when interest extends to cycles of invention, social learning and innovation, of the kind essential to extended cumulative culture. With these inherent challenges in mind, we discuss the inferences we draw from our study, and future elaborations and refinements of the approach. (b) Innovation and cumulative cultural progress in a child micro-society The most compelling conclusions about the principal processes under investigation come through multiple, but convergent, lines of evidence within our results. The fundamental characteristics agreed upon by most commentators on cumulative culture are that group achievements that are shaped through social learning are later built on by others to create innovations that are then further spread through social learning [ 2 , 3 , 13 \u2013 15 , 32 , 42 ]. Evidence for these effects came from contrasts between our asocial and group conditions, and the power of what children saw others do to predict what they elected to do themselves (Phase A (sections c,d) and Phase B (sections a,b); figures 5 \u21d1 \u21d1 \u2013 8 ), which we discuss further below. A further criterion emphasized by some is that later stages come to be beyond what any individual can develop from scratch [ 3 , 13 ], confirmed in our L4-only condition (Phase A (section b)). Despite ceding the control of inventions to the children rather than seeding them experimentally ourselves, there was clear evidence of social learning already in the extent to which children's success at particular exits among the four at L1 was predicted by their prior observation of the focus of other children's actions ( figure 6 and electronic supplementary material, figure S3). More generally, across levels L1\u2013L2\u2013L3 children were much more likely to match an earlier witnessed first invention of a successful solution in their group, than invent an approach themselves ( figure 5 ). Figure 5 illustrates that overall, 81% of children's first successes were those first invented by another child in their group. This figure is remarkably similar to the 84% of children being classed as \u2018followers\u2019 (social learners) as opposed to \u2018innovators\u2019 in one of the few other child micro-society cultural diffusion experiments [ 31 ] and a similar figure of 88% for \u2018followers\u2019 in a recent study with multiple solution options available [ 22 ]. Additional evidence that the cumulative learning indicated in figures 1 and 4 included elements of cultural, as well as individual, learning derive from other convergent results. The first innovation at any exit always followed an ascending order in the group, L1\u2013L2\u2013L3 (including rare cases of L1\u2013L3), and for all the nine principal exits used, the majority of children achieved their own first success after witnessing that first success in their group (wherever frequencies were adequate for testing, they displayed a statistically significant effect). The typical occurrence at L2 was for one child to achieve a first success in its group having already gained experience on its exit of choice (and often other exits) at L1, but with that experience having followed observation of a different inventor at L1 ( figure 7 ). The new approach at L2 was then copied by other children, to become a shared innovation. This was repeated at L3 but almost exclusively on the trapdoor exit (figures 7 and 8 ). Such effects went significantly beyond those seen in the asocial condition, demonstrating the power of cycles of invention, social learning and creation of escalating levels of innovation within social groups, already manifested in this early childhood micro-society. Such effects echo those demonstrated in cultural transmission experiments involving adults faced with complex technological challenges, in which communities (of five individuals) achieved significantly greater overall cumulative success than when each successive generation involved only a single individual [ 42 ; 39 \u2013 41 , for related findings]. Henrich and Muthukrishna et al. have referred to the cognitive resources shared in the group condition as those of a \u2018collective brain\u2019 [ 3 , 42 ], an expression apt to the contrast between the progressive innovations of the children in our groups, compared with the asocial condition. We suggest there is much scope here for linkage with recently expanding research on collective cognition in animal groups [ 59 , 60 ]. The results of the second series of experiments, which either introduced older children capable of higher-level invention, or imposed ecological change that removed the hitherto easiest options of L1\u2013L3, are particularly relevant for such contexts. In group KM, after an older child fashioned a hook tool and used it to open the L4 ramp exit, another child copied the application of this tool but used it on the most popular exit for its group, the trapdoor, and this was adopted by two further children, thus creating a shared innovation. A similar sequence occurred in group PM, where success at L4 occurred after the group was deprived of L1\u2013L3, but only when an older child was again introduced. One younger child copied that child's application of a hook tool to the ramp, but then, as in KM group, used it on the popular trapdoor exit, which was in turn replicated by a further child, again creating a shared innovation. In these episodes we begin to see the key components of cumulative culture, involving cycles of invention, social learning and shared innovations, with the inventions often being made by different individuals at escalating levels of achievement, thus building on the prior progress of the group as a whole. We note that in group PA the invention of hook use by a young child was not copied by others, unlike when the model was a 6-year-old in group PM and was copied. This is consistent with a recent systematic demonstration of a preference in young children for copying older as opposed to younger models [ 61 ]. (c) Omissions and future research The experimental approach introduced here has generated a rich dataset. In this article we have chosen to focus on the aspects of the results that best relate to the innovation theme of the journal issue, leaving aside several other significant questions that can be addressed. One major example of the latter concerns the emergence in the different child nursery groups of cultural variants. That such effects occurred is indicated here in figure 7 , where it is evident that some groups omitted any focus on certain exits on which other groups were active; however, the more comprehensive treatment that this question merits is beyond the scope of the present article and will be addressed elsewhere. The same is true for our comparative studies of how other species behave in SW and analogous environments. Earlier we explained why for this exploratory study we chose an open diffusion design. Doing so has generated a wealth of data that begin to chart the scope and limits of cumulative cultural and individual learning in children operating in a complex environment, but many of our inferences about the crucial social learning elements must remain tentative because they are essentially based on correlations between what children see and what they subsequently do, rather than on experimental manipulations. The social effects indicated by our results may have ranged over the potentially motivating effects of merely witnessing other children engaging with the SW, including particular parts of it, and also by seeing others gain rewards, although we have offered evidence for more specific copying of exit usage and application of tool use in doing this. We suggest that what we have learned in the present study can now best be built on by applying other forms of diffusion experiment that can pin down cumulative cultural transmission specifically, with more rigour. For example, if the SW were run in a replacement design [ 26 , 27 , 32 , 34 ] with triplets of children in each generation, then starting with children A, B and C, three successive replacement rounds would lead to a community made up of different children, D, E and F. If on average the later triplets displayed higher levels of achievement than the initial ones, it would unambiguously demonstrate cumulative cultural progress. We hope the present study will provide significant foundations for the further research that is needed to understand better the developmental origins of innovation and cumulative culture.

Despite this striking assumption, many recent studies have sought to assess whether neutrality can provide a good description of different episodes of cultural change. One approach has been to test whether neutral predictions are consistent with observed progeny distributions, recording the number of variants that have produced a given number of new instances within a specified time interval: a classic example is the distribution of baby names. Using an overlapping generations model, we show that these distributions consist of two phases: a power-law phase with a constant exponent of , followed by an exponential cut-off for variants with very large numbers of progeny. Maximum-likelihood estimations of the model parameters provide a direct way to establish whether observed empirical patterns are consistent with neutral evolution. We apply our approach to a complete dataset of baby names from Australia. Crucially, we show that analyses based on only the most popular variants, as is often the case in studies of cultural evolution, can provide misleading evidence for underlying transmission hypotheses. While neutrality provides a plausible description of progeny distributions of abundant variants, rare variants deviate from neutrality. Further, we develop a simulation framework that allows the detection of alternative cultural transmission processes. We show that anti-novelty bias is able to replicate the complete progeny distribution of the Australian dataset. This article is part of the themed issue \u2018Process and pattern in innovations from cells to societies\u2019. 1. Introduction Most theoretical modelling frameworks to cultural evolution make the simplifying assumption that innovations are the product of erroneous cultural transmission resulting in the introduction of cultural variants not previously seen in the population at low abundances (e.g. [ 1 , 2 ]). But regardless of the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of any particular innovation, its subsequent fate (i.e. whether it goes extinct immediately or is able to spread through the population and reach a certain degree of visibility) provides a window into the processes of cultural transmission present in the population. For example, the \u2018persistence\u2019 of a large number of innovations might point to population-level preferences for novel or rare variants. As a large number of such cultural transmission hypotheses have been proposed in the literature (see [ 3 ]), the question whether we can develop systematic approaches to distinguish between different transmission hypotheses using aggregated population-level data has gained importance. Seminal work by Bentley and colleagues (e.g. [ 4 \u2013 6 ]) on this topic has focused on distinguishing broadly between neutral and non-neutral cultural transmission processes. Neutral models of cultural transmission make the assumption that there are no selective differences between variants, so that the dynamics of a new variant are not biased towards either proliferation or extinction. This hypothesis results in a particular kind of stochastic dynamics, known as drift. In balancing the utility and availability of cultural data, the studies mentioned above identified the progeny distribution as a way to distinguish the neutral hypothesis from others. The progeny distribution logs the abundances of cultural variant types which produce k new individuals over a fixed period of time. Bentley and colleagues have estimated the form of the neutral progeny distribution through simulation techniques (e.g. [ 4 , 5 , 7 ]), concluding that the progeny distribution takes the form of a power law. The exponent of this power law has been fitted as a function that depends on the innovation rate and the total population size. The theoretical predictions have been compared against empirical data for the choice of baby names, US patents and their citations or pottery motifs, and these analyses provided support for the neutral hypothesis [ 4 , 5 ]. Despite this progress, an analytical expression for the neutral progeny distribution has been lacking so far, which has limited further developments in understanding whether observed distributions are consistent with neutrality, or demand non-neutral explanations. In this manuscript, we derive the first analytical representation of the neutral progeny distribution for large time intervals, using a neutral model where variants are not constrained to reproduce at discrete time points, known as an overlapping generations model. We show that the neutral progeny distribution consists of two phases. For small numbers of progeny there is a power-law phase. This is broadly consistent with the fits to earlier numerical simulations, but here we find that this power law has a fixed, universally applicable exponent of . Following this power-law phase, for large enough numbers of progeny there is eventually an exponential drop-off in this distribution. The onset of the exponential decline depends on the innovation rate: the larger the rate, the earlier is the onset. The analytical representation of the progeny distribution allows for maximum-likelihood estimations of the model parameter and therefore provides a direct way of parametrizing neutral models using cultural data, and of subsequently evaluating the consistency between observed data and the neutral hypothesis. Importantly, we establish that analyses based on only the most popular variants, as is often the case in studies of cultural evolution, can provide misleading evidence for neutral evolution. Further, we show that the progeny distribution represents a statistic that is able to detect alternative cultural transmission hypotheses, in particular bias for or against novelty, and therefore is potentially capable of distinguishing between different processes of cultural transmission based on population-level data. For that we develop a simulation procedure which includes pro- and anti-novelty bias. Anti-novelty bias is characterized as the preference for variants that have been present in the population for a long time (i.e. innovations possess an intrinsic disadvantage), while pro-novelty bias describes the preference for \u2018young\u2019 variant types that have only recently been introduced into the cultural system (i.e. innovations possess an intrinsic advantage). In general, we find that the progeny distribution reacts sensitively to those changes in the transmission process. Related results have been found by Mesoudi & Lycett [ 8 ], who concluded that strong frequency-dependent biases alter the shape of the progeny distribution. They also note that some transmission biases will generate population-level predictions indistinguishable from neutral predictions. Following [ 5 ], we apply our framework to an Australian dataset recording the first names of newborns (The code of the simulation framework can be downloaded from https://github.com/odwyer-lab/neutral_progeny_distribution .). We demonstrate the importance of rare variants for reliable inference of processes of cultural evolution from aggregated population-level data in the form of progeny distributions. While the temporal dynamics of abundant names are consistent with neutrality, the analysis based on the complete distribution, including popular and rare names, provides evidence against neutral evolution. This means that progeny distributions generate reliable inferences only in situations where the complete dataset is available. We find that anti-novelty bias is able to replicate the complete progeny distribution of the considered Australian baby name data. 2. Neutral theory and innovation Neutral models have provided basic null models in fields stretching from population genetics [ 9 ] and ecology [ 10 \u2013 14 ], to cultural evolution and the social sciences (e.g. [ 4 , 15 \u2013 17 ]). At the core of all varieties of neutral theory is a group of competing variants, and the assumption that selective differences between these variants are absent. In addition, most neutral models contain the possibility for innovation, i.e. the introduction of entirely new variants into the system. The most common approach to modelling an innovation event is to assume that with some rate a parent individual will produce an offspring of a new type instead of an offspring of the same parental type. This new variant then undergoes the same dynamics as all extant variants. The assumptions of neutrality are often at odds with the vast stores of knowledge biologists and anthropologists have accumulated for natural and social systems. For example, we know that even closely related biological species differ in their phenotype, and we might expect that these differences are important for predicting and understanding the properties of ecological communities. And yet despite this obvious roadblock, neutral models in ecology have had some considerable success in predicting patterns of biodiversity observed at a single snapshot in time [ 18 \u2013 29 ]. The same is true for cultural evolution, where humans are generally not thought of as making decisions at random. Neutrality would imply that individuals do not possess any preferences for existing cultural variants, nor does the adoption of a particular cultural variant provide an evolutionary advantage over the adoption of a different variant. While these inherent assumptions are likely to be violated in the cultural context (for detailed discussions see e.g. [ 15 , 16 , 30 ]), population-level patterns of various observed episodes of cultural change nevertheless resemble the ones expected under neutrality (e.g. [ 4 , 15 , 31 ]). Statistical tests of neutral theory often focus on static patterns of diversity, observed at one moment in time, such as the balance of rare and dominant species in a population. It has been shown that neutral steady-state predictions for the distribution of species abundances often closely match observed distributions. By contrast, neutral theories in ecology have had less success in predicting the dynamics of diversity, from decadal-scale species abundance fluctuations to geological ages of species [ 32 \u2013 36 ]. Similarly, recent work in cultural evolution has pointed to the importance of analysing temporal patterns of change as opposed to static measures of cultural diversity (e.g. [ 37 \u2013 40 ]) and to the influence of aggregation processes particularly in archaeological case studies [ 7 ] when testing for departures from neutrality. At the very least, these discrepancies bring to light the importance of what statistics are chosen to test a hypothesis like neutral evolution. In this context, a recent study [ 41 ] analysed the patterns of frequency change, in particular, the kurtosis of the distribution of changes over time, of stable words in the Google Ngram database. Interestingly, this approach identified words under selection: kurtosis values close to zero signalled neutrality while deviations from zero were indicative of selection. In this paper, we apply ecological neutral theory to cultural data. We use a model that allows for overlapping generations, an appropriate assumption when analysing distributions of cultural variants, and for an analytical representation of the progeny distribution. In the following, we provide a brief review of the characteristics of this model. (a) Neutral theory in ecology It is assumed that the temporal dynamics of species are governed by reproduction and competition, occurring in continuous time with a given set of rates. The full, interacting version of this model can be described by stochastic Lotka\u2013Volterra systems (with either symmetric, pairwise competition between species where the strength of the competition is controlled by the constant \u03b1 , or any related constraint on population size). Solving for the dynamics of these systems is, however, analytically intractable but a solvable mean field approximation has been found. This approximation is based on treating each species as interacting with the average state of all other species, rather than the specific configuration of abundances at any given moment in time [ 18 , 21 , 42 ]. In the limit of a large number of species this approach states that the correlation between the abundances of any two species is assumed to be small. In other words, the abundances of extant species are assumed to evolve independently of each other. Importantly, the resulting mean field description collapses nonlinear rates of competitive interaction into an increased, linear mortality rate for each species. This approximation of the overlapping generations neutral model is also known as the \u2018non-zero-sum\u2019 or NZS approximation, referring to the fact that the total population size may fluctuate over time, i.e. births and deaths do not sum to zero. It has been shown that this approach provides only a good approximation in populations with a large number of species, but in a less diverse population, where a handful of species are dominant, the mean field approximation is no longer a meaningful description. In the mean field approximation, each species takes an independent, random walk, based on a linear stochastic process. Mathematically, this is described by a linear master equation for the probability P ( n | t ) that a species has abundance n conditioned on its age (i.e. time since introduction into the system) 2.1 Here, t is the species' age, and for so-called \u2018point\u2019 speciation (where new species always have an abundance of 1) the initial condition is P ( n |0) = \u03b4 n ,1 (see figure 1 for a schematic of the model dynamic).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lycett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bentley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google ngram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nzs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "volterra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-23T18:57:16.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0b93dd29b1368447110716633064e531ddd49f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmynsFrIlX2VsSkc9GijawprHMMYse9yPEK_yXle1aj_nFuguqhfowYaClldVhNWJYr_1ZL0nmGYOgBMcDRCq0N", "site_full": "rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org", "site": "royalsocietypublishing.org", "site_section": "http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/rss/recent.xml", "site_categories": ["science", "biology"], "section_title": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences recent issues", "title": "Cognitive innovations and the evolutionary biology of expertise", "title_full": "Cognitive innovations and the evolutionary biology of expertise", "published": "2017-10-23T10:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45018, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f0b93dd29b1368447110716633064e531ddd49f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmynsFrIlX2VsSkc9GijawprHMMYse9yPEK_yXle1aj_nFuguqhfowYaClldVhNWJYr_1ZL0nmGYOgBMcDRCq0N", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dukas, R.", "published": "2017-10-23T10:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cognitive innovations and the evolutionary biology of expertise", "text": "Download powerpoint Figure 3. The gradual development of expertise leads to a corresponding increase in performance in a long-lived bird: the average (\u00b1s.e.) proportion of eggs that developed into free-flying young as a function of the breeding experience of their short-tailed shearwater mother. Adapted from Wooler et al . [ 34 ]. Factors other than expertise can explain some of the increase in the performance with individual age. These factors include higher survival rates of individuals of higher quality, an increase in effort with age, and physical and physiological improvements. Nevertheless, studies that either considered all the variables that can enhance performance with experience or addressed specific features such as foraging performance or anti-predatory behaviour have convincingly shown a dominant role for expertise. For example, the effects of differential survival rates were eliminated in studies that compared the same individuals over time (e.g. [ 32 , 43 , 44 ]). Effort had a negligible effect on increased performance with age in studies that measured it directly (e.g. [ 45 \u2013 47 ]). And at least one study that carefully measured physiological factors documented peak physiological performance much earlier than the peak in foraging success [ 48 ]. Similarly, many studies have documented that young birds require very long periods of time for acquiring complex foraging skills and for reducing mortality rates due to starvation and predation (e.g. [ 44 , 49 \u2013 51 ]). Learning can contribute to large improvements in performance even in short-lived species such as honeybees [ 32 , 33 ]. Expertise in short-lived individuals, however, is severely limited by the short time, typically several days, available for the development of cognitive abilities that depend on extensive learning and practice. Intriguingly, two whole-genome duplication events early in the evolution of vertebrates [ 52 ] opened up ample opportunities for evolutionary innovations that expanded neuronal complexity and cognitive abilities in that lineage [ 53 ]. On the gross anatomical scale, vertebrate innovations include complex brains, neural crest and placodes. Complex brains have specialized forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain regions. The neural crest contributes to a few structures including the sensory ganglia. Sensory placodes contribute to the eye, ear, lateral line and olfactory organs, while neurogenic placodes contribute sensory neurons to cranial ganglia [ 54 ]. At the molecular level, the two whole-genome duplications in vertebrates led to gene expansion in many synaptic gene families. Consequently, many fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) synaptic genes have up to four orthologues in mice ( Mus musculus ) [ 18 , 55 ]. At least two innovative experimental studies have attempted to link synaptic gene expansion and its associated increased complexity in synapse signalling mechanisms to cognition and behaviour in mice [ 56 , 57 ]. Given the enormous complexity of the synapse proteome, which consists of over 2000 proteins in mice [ 18 ], further experimental work is needed in order to assess the exact contribution of the massive synaptic gene expansion to vertebrate cognition in general and to expertise development in particular. Another evolutionary consequence of advanced learning and associated cognitive abilities is that they open up opportunities for individuals to adopt novel behaviours. First, learning often involves an early exploratory phase. When numerous individuals of each generation explore, the combined outcome is a massive search, which can lead to the discovery and adoption of novel, fitness-enhancing behaviours. Second, some types of learning lead to each individual changing its behaviour based on its specific experience at a certain place and time. Thus, if a given task (e.g. locating food) has a new optimum in a new environment (e.g. settings with novel foods), an individual may find that optimum via learning. That is, learning is a mechanism that can naturally lead to individuals adopting novel behaviours [ 58 ]. If such novel behaviours disappear when individual innovators die, they would probably have negligible evolutionary impact. This is because the novel behaviours are not associated with heritable genetic variation that natural selection can act upon. Novel behaviours, however, can be transmitted between individuals and across generations in species with social learning, which is discussed next. 5. The third innovation: social learning Social learning, defined as the acquisition of novel information from other individuals [ 59 , 60 ], deserves its place on the cognitive innovations list owing to two unique effects it has had on animal evolution. First, as noted in \u00a74, the evolution of learning probably led to an evolutionary cycle of increased individual value leading to selection on further improvement in learning, memory and other cognitive abilities that contribute to enhanced information capture and utilization. The trouble with individual expertise is that it is lost when that individual dies. Social learning resolves this organic constraint by allowing other individuals and, most importantly, members of subsequent generations, to acquire relevant knowledge from experts. Second, the evolutionary cycle of increased individual value has probably also led to the evolution of parental care. Parental care can merely mean providing food and protection. Such care alone can dramatically increase a young individual's probability of reaching adulthood. With social learning, however, parental care enables young novices to acquire successful skills from their experienced parents. This opens up novel ecological niches that require the use of extensive knowledge and complex abilities that are acquired through prolonged practice. Such niches may even further promote the evolution of cognitive features that enable the development of expertise. Examples include carnivores (e.g. cheetahs, Acinonyx jubatus ) and raptors (e.g. sparrowhawks, Accipiter nisus ) that feed on highly evasive or large prey [ 61 , 62 ]. We do not know the number of independent evolutionary origins of social learning, but it probably has had multiple beginnings as it is well established in a few classes of vertebrates and at least two insect orders [ 59 , 60 , 63 ]. There is currently too little information for generalizing about the biological mechanisms that enabled the evolution of social learning (but see [ 64 \u2013 67 ]). It is feasible, however, that reliance on social cues for learning is attainable by many animals with some threshold cognitive machinery. The ecological context for the evolution of social learning was most probably the tendency of individuals in many species to join others. For naive individuals, the presence of conspecifics at a given site might indicate the availability of good resources and safety. Joining others can also enhance feeding and predatory avoidance [ 68 \u2013 70 ]. An individual's tendency to associate with others can readily lead to that individual biasing its resource preference to that chosen by the other group members. A tendency to aggregate opens up further opportunities for taking advantage of the social setting, including the acquisition of relevant information from others. A basic tendency to socially bias food selection has been documented in fruit flies ( D. melanogaster ). In addition to their natural attraction to odours of yeast and fermenting fruit [ 71 ], which constitute the larval and adult food, fruit flies show long-distance attraction to the pheromone cis -vaccenyl acetate (cVA), which is produced by males and transferred to females during copulation [ 72 ]. Consequently, fruit flies typically occur in aggregations in the field and show modest social behaviours [ 73 ]. In controlled experiments, Sarin & Dukas [ 74 ] found that focal females that experienced novel food together with mated females, who had laid eggs on that food, subsequently showed a stronger preference for laying eggs on that food over another novel food compared with focal females that experienced the food alone. We observed no social learning, however, when observers experienced food with more ambiguous social information provided by the presence of either virgin models or the aggregation pheromone, cVA, alone. At the other extreme of the social learning spectrum, many vertebrates with extensive parental care provide opportunities for their offspring to learn complex skills. For example, parents in a variety of carnivores and raptors provide wounded prey for young, who can then practise killing the animal [ 75 ]. Similarly, adult helpers in meerkats ( Suricata suricatta ) provide young with live scorpions without their stingers. The young can then safely practise handling that dangerous food [ 76 ]. Another type of advanced social learning with a limited taxonomic distribution is imitation, defined as the copying of an action performed by another individual. With a few exceptions, most notably, vocal imitation in birds [ 77 , 78 ], imitation may have had significant effects on behaviour only in great apes (family Hominidae) [ 79 ]. By far the most significant case of imitation is language acquisition in human infants. 6. The fourth innovation: language Language has evolved only once in a single lineage and set its possessors apart from all other animals. Language is acquired via vocal imitation, which is rare among animals in general and absent even in humans' closest extant relatives [ 80 , 81 ]. The evolution of language most probably furthered the evolutionary cycle of enhanced cognitive abilities enabling greater expertise, with the latter selecting for improved cognition. Specifically, improved social learning and memory abilities allowed the evolution of language. In turn, improved language expertise probably selected for better cognitive abilities for better language acquisition and optimal handling of the larger volume of information acquired through language. Most notably, language could dramatically advance human social behaviour and the transmission of cultural information [ 82 , 83 ]. Language acquisition is highly cognitively demanding. Each newly born human infant initiates a long process of acquiring language expertise culminating in a vocabulary of 50 000\u2013100 000 words and complex grammar in adulthood [ 84 ]. Infants rely heavily on social learning from their parents, who talk to them in infant-directed speech (motherese) characterized by slower speech with simplified sentence structure, repetition, longer pauses, a higher fundamental frequency and greater pitch variation than in adult-directed speech [ 85 , 86 ]. Language learning involves sophisticated social understanding, detection of statistical regularities, perception across modalities (e.g. connecting face to speech, sight with sound and symbol with object) and extensive memory [ 87 , 88 ]. We cannot reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics among enhanced cognition, cultural changes and language in early hominid evolution [ 89 ]. It is commonly agreed, however, that language capacity has existed for at least 100 000 years [ 90 ]. It is also widely recognized that language precipitated a range of unique abilities that have allowed humans to successfully spread to all continents except Antarctica. These abilities include enhanced tool technologies such as composite tools with handles, use of novel tool materials including bones and antlers, long-distance exchange of raw materials, hunting of large, dangerous animals, structured use of domestic space, use of pigments and self ornaments, and rituals [ 91 , 92 ]. The strong reliance on rich language for social learning in increasingly larger social groups and the rapid accumulation of culture led to the evolution of human agriculture, writing and, more recently, to the industrial and technological revolutions. A consequence of the large increase in social groups, social organization and rapid accumulation of cultural knowledge in the past few thousands of years has been increased specialization among individual humans. In addition to general expertise in language and social skills shared by all individuals, some humans spend many years, even decades, honing their highly specialized narrow expertise. Well-studied examples include expertise in specific fields of science, medicine and arts, and in competitive games such as chess [ 37 , 93 , 94 ]. 7. The evolutionary biology of expertise: conclusion and prospects An individual's life can be perceived as acquiring and relying on information to make decisions that maximize fitness. Key innovations throughout animal evolution have led to some lineages expanding resource allocation to cognitive structures handling information and time necessary both for their development and for the acquisition of complex skills, or expertise. The evolution of the nervous system was a natural consequence of the increased complexity associated with multicellularity. Such complexity allows for greater efficiency and regulation of specialized cells, and provides more opportunities for further refinement, improvement and innovation [ 95 , 96 ]. While neurons' initial role was internal communication and coordination, the associated neuromodulation opened up mechanistic opportunities leading to information acquisition and retention. Learning, initially via individual experience and later also through social interactions, probably stimulated an evolutionary cycle of increased investment in and reliance on cognitive skills culminating in the evolution of language and modern human civilization. With a few exceptions [ 32 , 46 , 97 ], expertise has been subjected to research only in the field of human psychology [ 37 , 42 ]. While we know little about the genetics and neurobiology of complex skill acquisition, it is likely that humans share similar mechanisms with non-humans. It is possible, however, that a major axis of evolutionary change within vertebrates has been associated with cognitive improvements leading to increased capacities for storing and effectively using vast amounts of knowledge and experience. The two whole-gene duplications early in vertebrate evolution and further events of gene duplication in primates and humans [ 52 , 53 , 98 , 99 ] have indeed vastly increased brain complexity and probably enhanced complex skill acquisition. The exact genetic, neurobiological and physiological mechanisms, as well as the evolutionary biology of expertise and expert performance, deserve rigorous examination. On the mechanistic side, we have to test whether there are unique mechanisms underlying expertise acquisition in certain species. In humans, a remarkable aspect of expertise is that experts can handle more information more rapidly and execute better decisions within their expertise than can novices. Moreover, tasks that are initially very challenging and attention demanding become \u2018automated\u2019 with extensive practice, meaning that they are performed easily with little attention. Familiar examples include reading and driving [ 100 ]. If there are universal mechanisms that underlie complex skill acquisition, they can most readily be examined in classical animal model systems such as fruit flies and mice. Alternatively, documenting variation among taxa in the mechanisms underlying expertise will open up a search for the genetic and neurobiological mechanisms generating such probable differences. On the evolutionary side, we ought to quantify genetic variation in the rate of expertise acquisition and peak expert performance, and their association with fitness. We know, for example, that young in a variety of species that rely on complex foraging skills face high mortality rates while in the process of attaining their expertise (e.g. [ 49 , 51 ]). But we know little about the evolutionary biology of such and other cases of slow and costly expertise development, which is likely followed by large benefits to the surviving experts. The functional and mechanistic properties of expertise constitute an exciting central topic for future research. Data accessibility This article has no additional data.

In addition, the relationship between population size and cultural accumulation has been the subject of extensive debate, in part because anthropological studies have demonstrated a significant association between population size and toolkit complexity in only a subset of studied cultures. Here, we review the role of cultural innovation in constructing human evolutionary niches and introduce a new model to describe the accumulation of human cultural traits that incorporates the effects of cultural niche construction. We consider the results of this model in light of available data on human toolkit sizes across populations to help elucidate the important differences between food-gathering societies and food-producing societies, in which niche construction may be a more potent force. These results support the idea that a population's relationship with its environment, represented here by cultural niche construction, should be considered alongside population size in studies of cultural complexity. This article is part of the themed issue \u2018Process and pattern in innovations from cells to societies\u2019. 1. Introduction The forces underlying cultural complexity have been the centre of some controversy for over a decade (e.g. [ 1 \u2013 8 ]). This debate primarily centres around the relationship between population size and cultural complexity, with some researchers asserting that these two are strongly linked [ 8 ] and some suggesting that there is no strong relationship [ 7 ]. Mathematical models and laboratory experiments have consistently suggested that demographic factors such as population size or connectedness should drive cultural complexity (e.g. [ 1 , 9 \u2013 12 ]). However, both regional and worldwide statistical analyses have shown little support for this idea in food-gathering societies (i.e. in hunter\u2013gatherers), where proxy measures for environmental risk have been shown to be associated with toolkit complexity but population size has not [ 5 , 7 , 13 , 14 ]. However, a link has been found between population size and cultural complexity in food-producing societies, for example for small-scale agriculturalists [ 15 ]. With this in mind, we reviewed the existing empirical studies of population size and cultural complexity, categorizing the results by subsistence strategy ( table 1 ). View this table: View popup Table 1. Survey of empirical studies of cultural complexity and population size. For empirical studies of cultural complexity, we note whether the studied populations were food gatherers (italics) or food producers (bold). We observe a stark difference between these two strategies: there was no significant association between cultural complexity and population size in studies of food-gathering populations, but there was a significant association in the studies of food-producing populations. This survey of the literature suggests that, to date, a significant relationship between cultural complexity and population size has been observed for food-producing societies (six studies, highlighted in bold in table 1 ) but not for food-gathering societies (five studies, highlighted in italics in table 1 ). The articles on food-producing societies surveyed in table 1 include studies of both small-scale agriculturalist and industrialized societies. Both of these types of societies modify their environment through niche construction, and industrialized societies also tend to have both economies of scale and a division of labour in which subsets of people are specialized in different areas, further increasing cultural complexity [ 19 , 22 , 23 ]. We note that the patterns in table 1 hold despite the use of census population size in most studies, which lacks information about cultural connectivity and network size and can thus misrepresent the size of a population's cultural deme [ 8 ]. Taken together, the results surveyed in table 1 suggest that, whereas population size appears to correlate with cultural complexity in food-producing and industrialized societies, factors other than population size could be mediating the cultural complexity of food-gathering societies. Indeed, in each of the studies of food-gathering societies, the size of the cultural repertoire was significantly correlated with some aspect of environmental instability, such as risk of resource failure [ 5 , 16 ], mobility [ 16 ], length of the growing season [ 3 ], environmental risk [ 6 , 14 ] and effective temperature [ 15 ]. Thus, the environment could play a more important role than population size in mediating cultural accumulation in food-gathering societies but not in food-producing societies. Collard et al . [ 15 ] suggested that a form of niche construction could dampen the impact of environmental changes by cushioning and stabilizing the food supply, making populations more robust to environmental fluctuations. In this case, the environment may not play such a strong role in determining cultural complexity, and there may be more scope for population size to influence cultural complexity. Indeed, this is the situation that is most often modelled, as environmental fluctuations do not appear in most models. A model that accounts for environmental fluctuations, innovation rates and demographic factors, such as population size or density, could help to bridge the gap between data analysis and theoretical models in this contentious field. Here, we present a model in which cultural evolution is affected by both population size and the environment. This framework is applicable to the tools and technologies in a population that have a potential fitness effect; in other words, we primarily consider the cultural evolution of tools that are relevant to survival and reproduction, such as those involved with food acquisition, clothing and shelter, as opposed to more symbolic types of culturally transmitted traits, such as language or ornamentation. We assume that these technologies might not be useful in all possible environmental conditions; if the environment changes or the population migrates to a new environment, the weather patterns, soil chemistry and native flora and fauna might change, rendering the previous cultural repertoire less advantageous. If an individual's cultural repertoire is not well suited to the environment, that individual has the chance to innovate at each time step. However, the degree to which the environment affects a population's fitness might depend on the level of niche construction in that population: if a population has heavily modified the aspects of the environment that are relevant to its fitness, perhaps through agricultural practices, that population might be buffered against environmental changes that would disrupt the fitness of a food-gathering population. If the culture of this hypothetical gathering population is closely tied to environmental instability, population size might have a reduced effect on its cultural complexity compared with the hypothetical agricultural population. With this model, we analyse the interactions between environmental change, population size and cultural complexity, and we assess how these interactions may differ when a population extensively alters its own environment. The model's results are consistent with the observed patterns of cultural complexity across studied populations to date, suggesting that this cultural niche construction hypothesis is a plausible factor in cultural accumulation, warranting further investigation. 2. The model Here, we present an agent-based simulation model based on the study of Fogarty et al. [ 12 , 24 ] that takes account of environmental harshness and variability, as well as the effect of population size on measures of cultural accumulation. We consider a well-mixed population of size N ; we assume that this population does not have outside contacts and, thus, N is also the size of the cultural deme . Each individual has a repertoire of up to 500 cultural traits or behaviours, and new traits can be innovated or learned during an individual's lifetime. Following Fogarty et al . [ 12 , 24 ], each time step of the model involves the birth of a new individual, learning and death. This sequence is repeated N times; this is one generation. After each generation, the environmental state may change. An individual's fitness depends on its ability to match its behaviour to the environment. Cultural complexity is calculated by counting the number of cultural traits that appear in the cultural repertoire of at least one individual. (a) Birth, learning and innovation In each time step, a new individual is born. The new child chooses a role model to copy with a probability proportional to each adult's relative fitness in the population (in other words, new individuals show a prestige bias in choosing their role model) and copies the cultural traits of that role model with fidelity \u03b2 \u2265 0.9 applied to each trait independently. (Note that a model including unbiased learning (with a randomly chosen role model) produces similar results (see electronic supplementary material, figure S1), but the model cannot speak to the possible effects of cross-population differences in the prevalence of prestige bias.) The new individual replaces an existing individual with a probability inversely proportional to fitness in the adult population, with the new individual more likely to replace a low fitness individual. Thus, an individual's fit to the current environment affects both its probability of becoming a cultural role model and its probability of death. Every time step, each individual has a chance to innovate, attempting to add a trait to its repertoire with a probability \u03bc in = 1/ N . However, the individual will only attempt to innovate if none of its current behaviours matches the environmental state, E (see below). This means that individuals tend to innovate in response to environmental pressure. This type of deliberate innovation has been shown to be a key component of human creativity and important in models of cultural evolution [ 25 ]. (b) The environment The environment is defined by set of integers 1 : E n , where E n is the number of possible environmental states. At any one time, the environment takes a value, E , between 1 and E n . Each individual in the population has a repertoire of cultural traits, and each of these traits also takes a numerical value between 1 and E n . Individuals can achieve an optimal level of fitness by matching (numerically) the environmental state with one of its cultural traits or behaviours. However, the individual can gain some fitness by closely approximating the environmental state. This is mediated by a parameter that reflects the \u2018harshness\u2019 of the environment, h , such that fitness is proportional to where \u03b4 i is the absolute value of difference between E and the closest trait value in the repertoire of individual i ( figure 1 ; see also [ 26 ] for further details).

Models of domestication rate and rate estimates. ( a ) Hypothetical series of archaeobotanical data for non-shattering plotted against time with a least-squares linear regression as an estimate of rate of change [ 12 , 25 , 26 ].

( c ) Hypothetical series of archaeobotanical data points forming selection chains fitted to closest logistic curves of differing rates (method developed in this paper). The present contribution takes the analysis of these data closer to a realistic estimate of the changing rates of evolution and selection pressures over the course of a given domestication episode. It is expected that any evolutionary process of directional selection will approximate a sigmoidal (logistic) pattern of change [ 2 , 21 ]. In the present contribution we explore the potential to use any pair of time series data points to represent the specific sections of the sigmoidal process, more localized in space and over a shorter time scale ( figure 1 c ). As such we are modelling from archaeobotanical data\u2014the fossil record of crop domestication\u2014how the strength of selection changed over the course of the entire domestication process, in other words, whether different sigmoidal processes were in action over time. This in turn allows us to identify particular periods when human-driven selection was stronger, and it also provides a baseline for estimating backwards in time to when the earliest selection for domestication traits began. In other words we are able to predict when the beginnings of the effects of pre-domestication activity occurred, e.g. the gathering of wild grasses, as well as identifying when cereal domestication intensified. 2. Material and methods We have collected all of the available sub-fossil data for cereal non-shattering from archaeological plant assemblages in the putative geographical regions of origin that indicate change towards domestication traits for four crops, including Asian rice ( O. sativa ), barley ( H. vulgare ), einkorn wheat ( T. monococcum ) and emmer wheat ( T. dicoccon ) (electronic supplementary material). In the current study, we have excluded indeterminate remains of wheat and barley as well as immature (green-harvested) spikelet bases of rice. Previous studies have used the proportions of uncertain specimens to estimate error margins and standard deviations [ 12 , 25 ], whereas we have taken a different approach to this to account for sample size (see below). Assemblage data are placed on an absolute time scale by calculation of the median age estimate of the archaeological phases [ 12 , 24 ]. All dates are given in calibrated BC. These data are drawn from across multiple sites, which are taken as representative of an evolutionary process of domestication taking place over a broader region and period. This assumes that archaeobotanical assemblages represent a regional meta-population undergoing domestication over an extended period of time. This is necessary as no one archaeological site that has yet been discovered was occupied through the entire domestication process (approx. 4000 years), and, therefore, there is no single stratigraphic archive that has preserved an entire domestication process in situ . Where single sites do demonstrate increasing domestication traits, such as the rise in domesticated type rice spikelet bases during the 300\u2013400 years of occupation at Tianluoshan, a gradual change is evident, similar to those from comparisons across sites [ 19 ]. As demonstrated by numerous case studies not related to domestication, geographical mosaics of co-evolution are recurrent features of evolution [ 32 ], and it can be suggested that both \u2018hotspots and \u2018cold-spots\u2019 of selection for domestication traits are likely to have occurred within the broader regions of agricultural origins [ 27 , 31 ]. Recently, genomic studies of some crops, including barley [ 33 ], emmer [ 34 ], einkorn [ 35 ] and Asian rice [ 36 , 37 ], indicate that modern domesticated populations derive in part from genetic diversity from numerous geographically disparate wild genepools. In the present analyses, time series data were modelled as selection chains, themselves inferred from a parsimonious model of selection and spread, making the populations represented by younger sites derivative of any older sites for which this is a plausible relationship. Selection chains were constructed by assuming that data points that are closer together in time, space and the proportion of non-shattering are more likely to be part of the same trajectory. For the most part we assumed that domestication is directional and, therefore, that increasing percentages of non-shattering types are to be expected. We also considered the possibility that periods of negative selection could have taken place over shorter timescales within the overall domestication episode. This would be in keeping with the potential of fluctuating selection [ 29 , 30 ] or a period of semi-domestication [ 27 ]. This may have occurred during periods of fallow or changing practice, which could have led to some selection chains becoming disconnected in our analysis owing to falling frequencies of shattering over time. These episodes of negative selection are indicated by grey arrows in the figures below, and are discussed separately. Multiple potential pathways of evolution are possible and this allows us to increase the number of estimates of selection pressure over time and, therefore, look for general patterns in the strength of selection pressure. We assume that it takes time for domesticates to spread between sites. In the case of early rice domestication in the Lower Yangtze, all sites are in fairly close proximity, lying within an elliptical area of approximately 65 000 km 2 , accounting for evidence dating between 6000 and 2000 BC. By contrast the greater \u2018Fertile Crescent\u2019 of southwestern Asia is much larger and requires an elliptical area of approximately 3.5 million km 2 . In this region, therefore, some sites are quite distant from each other, and thus it is more likely that selection chains should be inferred for sites that are reasonably close to each other. In addition, material culture, such as lithic sickle typology, shows regional differences across Southwest Asia [ 24 ]. We therefore added an additional calculation to the construction of selection chains in wheat and barley by creating a time and space matrix that penalized longer distance and shorter time period inter-relationships. This model considered two rate parameters, the rate with which frequencies change between two sites, and the velocity with which cultures would be required to move between sites. The rate of transition towards tough rachis dominance between sites was inferred through the tough rachis allele change between two sites represented by the selection coefficient ( s ). The minimum velocity ( v m ) with which individuals would have to travel between sites in order for cultural continuity to be represented is estimated by utilizing the geographical distance divided by the maximum amount of time permitted by the archaeological dates. In the case of the Near East, the geographical distance was calculated with respect to viable routes that circumvented the central desert regions of the Near East by preferentially taking routes through the Fertile Crescent. To calculate s we first had to infer the allele frequencies associated with phenotypic frequencies observed in the archaeological record. To do this, we calculated the inbreeding coefficient ( F ) associated with the mating system of the crops, which was assumed to be 98% inbreeding. The inbreeding coefficient was determined by simulation that began with Hardy\u2013Weinberg proportions of genotypes P, R and Q (dominant homozygous, heterozygous and recessive homozygous genotypes, respectively) which were then mated with a 0.98 probability of selfing. The subsequent generation gave rise to new proportions of P, Q and R that deviated from Hardy\u2013Weinberg, the reduction in heterozygosity being an estimate of F. Such that 2.1 where R is the proportion of heterozygotes, and p and q are dominant and recessive allele frequencies, respectively. Generations were iteratively produced, and F calculated each generation until it ceased to change by more than 0.00001, indicating the simulation had converged on the inbreeding equilibrium and a close approximation of F obtained. We assumed that tough rachis phenotypes represented homozygous recessive mutations, and, therefore, the Q value of genotypes, and associated with the q allele. Allele frequency was then determined by finding values of q that satisfy the equation 2.2 where Q is the observed proportion of tough rachis grains in the archaeobotanical record. To find s we simulated phenotypes of P, R and Q with proportions calculated from the determined allele frequencies and inbreeding coefficient beginning with the allele frequency of q associated with the oldest of a pair of archaeological sites. New generations were constructed as before, with P, R and Q genotypes mating with themselves with a 0.98 probability. Each generation the proportion Q was modified by s such that 2.3 where Q\u2032 is the proportional value of Q after a round of selection. Note that s took negative values because the recessive homozygote is advantageous in this case. The simulations proceeded through a number of generations defined by the difference in age between the two archaeological sites under comparison. Values of s were then determined that coincided with the observed change in tough rachis frequency between the two archaeological sites under comparison. Simulations to calculate s values from datasets of age and tough rachis proportions were carried out by a program written by R.G.A. (available on request). The simulations also recorded the date in generations that various frequencies would be reached ranging from 0.00001 to 1. Selection chains were then determined from transition scores, which were calculated from the velocity of movement between sites and strength of selection. To emphasize the parsimony of slow movement and selection, the inverse of velocity and selection coefficient were used, such that a transition score ( T s ) between two sites could be summarized as 2.4 which is the geometric mean of the inverses. The geometric mean is relatively robust to the different orders of magnitude associated with velocity and selection coefficient values; consequently in this model they are of equable influence on the transition score. Each archaeological locality had a series of transition scores relating to the other sites, and the highest scoring values were taken as the most likely connections of cultural continuity explained by a combination of the least selection and minimum travel speed required. However, under this model older sites will tend to become favoured over younger sites as likely points of cultural connection to later sites, even if associated with a stronger selection pressure, because of their tendency to be associated with lower velocities. To account for this we envisioned the possibility that sites could have existed over a longer time frame than the absolute dates suggest in the model and imputed a velocity that assumes all sites to be contemporaneous. In such a case the strength of selection is unaffected, because we are inferring what the frequency would have been at a particular time point, but the value s remains unchanged over time. The imputed minimum velocity ( v mi ) was calculated as 2.5 where d and c are, respectively, the distance between sites and a constant, for which we used an arbitrary value of 2000. Consequently, the imputed transition score ( T si ) was calculated as in equation (2.4), with v i substituted for v mi . Note that our choice of c has no effect on the relative magnitudes of T si values because of the robustness of the geometric mean to differences in scale between terms. Selection chains were then established by inferring most likely connections between sites based on the highest transition scores. We found that imputed transition scores down-weighted the influence of the oldest sites but made little difference to later connections between sites. Selection chains defined which selection coefficients that had been calculated between archaeological sites should be retained. Ranges for selection coefficient values were generated by considering the 95% and 67% ranges of tough rachis proportions at sites, for their given sample sizes. These were obtained using the beta distribution, with parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 defined as the counts of tough rachis and wild-type rachis plus one, respectively. The proportions for each pair of sites were then used to calculate values of s using the same program as above, highest and lowest values were taken as the range limits for 95% and 67%, respectively, and their associated age dates. The selection chains were then used to determine which selection coefficients were associated with the domestication process, and particularly the earliest stages of the process. These had to be taken from tough rachis frequency values above zero found at the oldest archaeological sites, because in effect the true proportions at these sites is unknown. The earliest selection coefficients were then used to estimate an average early selection coefficient. This value was then fed into the previous simulation as a fixed parameter to determine the ages at which various allele frequencies would be reached, given the allele frequency of a given site at a given time. We assumed a starting frequency for a new mutation to be 0.00001 (0.001%), which assumes an effective population size of 50,000, not unreasonable for cereals given genetic diversity estimates. However, ages associated with possible higher starting frequencies were also recorded. 3. Results (a) Rice Oryza sativa has long been a major staple of civilizations in East, South and Southeast Asia. Recent genomic data strongly support domestication of subspecies japonica from perennial Oryza rufipogon, with the closest living wild populations found in southern China [ 38 , 39 ]. However, former wild populations in central China extirpated over the last 1000 years are likely to be closer to the ancestor ( figure 2 a ). Domesticated rice arrived at Shixia in Guangdong at ca 2600 BC [ 41 ]. Other Asian rice subspecies, notably subspecies indica and the aus group, have distinct geographical origins [ 37 , 39 , 40 ]. Archaeobotanical data points to the earliest rice cultivation in the Yangtze Basin, with two candidate regions around the Middle and Lower Yangtze Basin having the greatest support from current archaeobotanical data [ 20 , 42 ]. While selection for non-shattering may have begun in more than one part of the Yangtze and its tributaries the most completely documented domestication is that of the Lower Yangtze.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hardy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weinberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "guangdong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shixia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yangtze", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tianluoshan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yangtze basin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southwest asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lower yangtze", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "near east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle and lower yangtze basin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-23T18:57:25.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50832393d1645189c43e0c65d8f4a8b7eee9e0a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmynsFrIlX2VsSkc9GijawprHMMYse9yPEK_yXle1aj_nFuguqhfowYaClldVhNWJacnn_xbkvDuMY.CwYweqPG", "site_full": "rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org", "site": "royalsocietypublishing.org", "site_section": "http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/rss/recent.xml", "site_categories": ["science", "biology"], "section_title": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences recent issues", "title": "Non-adaptive origins of evolutionary innovations increase network complexity in interacting digital organisms", "title_full": "Non-adaptive origins of evolutionary innovations increase network complexity in interacting digital organisms", "published": "2017-10-23T10:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45018, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "50832393d1645189c43e0c65d8f4a8b7eee9e0a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmynsFrIlX2VsSkc9GijawprHMMYse9yPEK_yXle1aj_nFuguqhfowYaClldVhNWJacnn_xbkvDuMY.CwYweqPG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Fortuna, M.

Schematic of the adaptive and non-adaptive origins of a host resistance trait. The host (green ellipse) has a receptor on its surface (i.e. a trait represented by a green rectangle) which allows it to consume resources from the environment. That receptor is also used by a parasite (in red) to infect the host. Computing logic functions, such as NOT and NAND, by executing the instructions that both digital hosts and parasites harbour in their genomes is analogous to having resistance and infectivity traits. The host can evolve a resistance trait (i.e. computing a novel Boolean logic operation such as NAND, represented by a green triangle on the surface of the host) following two different evolutionary trajectories: (i) evolving the novel trait through a single-point mutation while losing the ancestral one (i.e. computing the NAND logic function while losing the ability to perform the NOT logic function) or (ii) evolving a non-adaptive trait (i.e. exaptation) through a single-point mutation that does not confer resistance to the host, but facilitates the loss of the ancestral trait through a second mutation and, hence, provides resistance to the parasite. In this study, we compare a scenario with both possibilities (adaptive and non-adaptive) versus a second scenario in which we suppress non-adaptive origins. The difference between the two scenarios will help us estimate the importance of non-adaptive origins of evolutionary innovations. After either resistance was evolved, the parasite may overcome it by mutations in its own genome and become infective again. 2. Methods (a) Digital evolution Digital evolution is an applied branch of Artificial Life. In this evolutionary computation framework, self-replicating computer programs\u2014digital organisms\u2014evolve within a user-defined computational environment [ 22 ]. Avida is the most widely used software platform for research in digital evolution [ 20 ]. It satisfies the three essential requirements for evolution to occur: replication, heritable variation and differential fitness. Differences in fitness among digital organisms arise through competition for the limited resources of memory space and central processing unit (CPU) time. A digital organism in Avida consists of a sequence of instructions\u2014its genome or genotype\u2014and a virtual CPU, which executes these instructions. Some of these instructions are involved in copying an organism's genome, which is the only way the organism can pass on its genetic material to future generations. To reproduce, a digital organism must copy its genome instruction by instruction into a new region of memory. The copying process occasionally introduces mutations including point mutations, insertions and deletions. For example, a point mutation occurs when an instruction is copied incorrectly, and is instead replaced in the offspring genome by an instruction chosen at random (with a uniform distribution) from a set of 33 possible instructions. In addition to the instructions required for replication (i.e. viability), the instruction set includes basic arithmetic operations (such as addition, multiplications and bit-shifts) as well as the logic operator nand that are executed on binary numbers taken from the environment through input\u2013output instructions. When the output of processing these numbers equals the result of a specific Boolean logic operation, such as the AND and OR Boolean functions, the digital organism is said to have a trait represented by that logic operation. We have focused here on the following nine Boolean logic operations that organisms can perform on 32-bit one- and two-input numbers: NOT, NAND (not-and), AND, OR_N (or-not), OR, AND_N (and-not), NOR (not-or), XOR (exclusive or) and EQU (logical equality). We configured the environment so that it contains a single resource that must be consumed by organisms for successful replication. This resource renews at a constant rate and influences the carrying capacity of the population. For organisms to successfully consume a unit of resource, they must compute before replication at least one Boolean logic function. If there is no single available unit of this resource, replication fails and the organism begins the execution of its genome's instructions again without producing any offspring. When applied to multiple organisms, this procedure leads to density-dependent population growth. In addition, there are two sources of density-dependent mortality: (i) if an organism does not successfully divide, it dies after executing five times its genome's instructions (i.e. five failed replication attempts), and (ii) as a result of offspring being randomly placed in the population, a resident organism can be overwritten by the newly generated offspring. (b) Digital coevolution In order to study coevolution in populations of interacting organisms, we have implemented parasitic organisms and a mechanism for them to infect the above-described digital organisms (i.e. hosts) based on genetically encoded phenotypes [ 2 , 23 ]. This new branch of Avida supports threading capabilities (i.e. more than one type of organism executing their instructions in parallel) and separate memory spaces for hosts and parasites (i.e. regions of memory reserved for the genome of the offspring produced during the self-replication process). It uses a 33-instruction set that expanded the 26-instruction default genetic language of Avida (electronic supplementary material, File S1). Parasitic digital organisms are almost identical to the hosts, and as such they self-replicate by copying their genome instruction by instruction into a new memory space. But they operate inside hosts, stealing CPU cycles from them to execute their own genome's instructions and, hence, reduce their host fitness. However, parasites have memory spaces entirely separated from their host's and, therefore, do not have access to their host's instructions. This avoids any unforeseen side-effects such as those observed in the digital evolution platform Tierra [ 24 ], where parasites can overwrite their host's genome. The selective pressure of a parasite on its host (i.e. virulence) is determined by the probability that a CPU cycle from the host will be given to the parasite. When this probability is set to 0.5, parasites and hosts split CPU cycles evenly, and when it is set to 1, the parasite uses all of its host's CPU cycles. In the latter case, the relationship is analogous to a predator\u2013prey interaction. After making a copy of its genome using the CPU cycles \u2018stolen\u2019 from its host, a parasite must place its newly generated offspring into an uninfected host. It attempts to do this by executing the instruction \u2018Inject\u2019. The parasite's offspring is then randomly placed in the host population. If the chosen memory space is occupied by an uninfected host, the parasite can infect it. By contrast, if the memory space is either occupied by an infected host or empty, infection will fail. Multiple infections are not allowed (i.e. a host can only be infected by one parasite). Parasites cannot infect just any host. The mechanism of infection is based on phenotypic trait matching, i.e. an uninfected host will be infected by a parasite's offspring if the parasite computed at least one of the Boolean logic functions that the host also computed. This mechanism of infection emulates the inverse gene-for-gene model, where infectiousness is determined by parasite recognition of host signals and/or receptors [ 25 ]. Parasites, like hosts, show density-dependent population growth (i.e. infections fail when most hosts are already infected). In addition, a parasite dies when its host replicates successfully. (c) Coevolutionary dynamics We sampled genotype space to find the hosts and parasites that were used as ancestors in the coevolutionary scenarios described below. Specifically, we first identified 30 mutationally robust viable hosts capable of performing only the NOT logic operation and 15 mutationally robust viable parasites capable of performing only the NOT logic operation. Next, we quantified the long-term stable coexistence of all 30 \u00d7 15 = 450 host\u2013parasite pairs in a purely ecological scenario in which mutations were allowed neither in hosts nor in parasites. We kept the 216 (48%) host\u2013parasite pairs in which both hosts and parasites coexisted to study their coevolutionary dynamics (see the electronic supplementary material). Then, we expanded this purely ecological framework by introducing evolution into host\u2013parasite population dynamics. We introduced novel genotypic variation into the host and parasite populations as single-point mutations, i.e. substitutions of one instruction in the offspring's genome by another instruction randomly chosen from the 33-instruction set. Hence, genome size was kept constant for both hosts and parasites. We applied a mutation rate per instruction in an organism's genome of \u03bc H = 0.025 and \u03bc P = 0.01 for hosts and parasites, respectively. This means that, on average, 1 out of 40 host offspring will become a novel host, and 1 out of 100 parasite offspring will become a novel parasite. Note that, in nature, mutation rates of phages are higher than those of bacteria, but their genomes are also smaller, while here, genome size was the same and kept constant during the evolutionary processes for both hosts and parasites. We set the probability that a CPU cycle from an infected host was given to the parasite to 0.9 (i.e. the parasite used 90% of the host CPU cycles). For each of the 216 host\u2013parasite pairs that coexisted in the long term in a purely ecological scenario (electronic supplementary material, File S2), we performed 10 independent coevolutionary processes (i.e. replicates). Note that both host and parasite ancestors were able to compute the Boolean logic function NOT. Each process started from a population of 10 4 hosts with the same ancestral genotype and, after the host reached its carrying capacity ( K \u2248 6500, on average for the 30 distinct hosts used), we infected half of the host population with the same ancestral parasite genotype. After 2 \u00d7 10 5 updates, where an update is the amount of time during which an organism executes on average 30 instructions (i.e. on average 10 4 generations), we stopped the coevolutionary process and retrieved the data generated during the entire process. We repeated each coevolutionary process for each of the two scenarios described below, i.e. allowing and prohibiting non-adaptive origins of resistance traits (216 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 2 = 4320 coevolutionary processes). (i) Non-adaptive and adaptive origins of resistance traits As a host population evolves, organisms might perform other Boolean logic operations besides or instead of NOT. Performing a new logic function is analogous to evolving a novel trait. In order to become resistant, hosts must lose their ability to perform the ancestral NOT logic function (so that parasites cannot infect them) while also evolving a novel trait (i.e. the ability to perform a new Boolean logic function) so that they can continue to collect the resources required for replication. If a host evolves a novel logic function without losing the ancestral one, the novel function has no adaptive value, as the parasite can still infect the host and there is no fitness advantage in having more than one trait for collecting resources. Later on, when a host loses the ability to perform the ancestral logic function, the evolved trait will have an adaptive value since it has become necessary to collect resources. We then refer to this evolved trait as an exaptation\u2014an adaptive trait of an organism that was not adaptive when it originated or we say that this adaptation has a non-adaptive origin. In contrast to the scenario described next, we allow the replication of hosts capable of performing a novel logic function while keeping the ability to perform the ancestral one (electronic supplementary material, File S3). When a host evolves a novel logic function while losing its ability to perform the ancestral one, the novel trait has adaptive value from its inception. This is so, because it allows the host to collect resources required for replication and confers resistance to parasites. We suppress exaptations in this scenario by preventing the replication of hosts that perform more than one logic function (electronic supplementary material, File S4). Novel traits evolve at the same time hosts lose ancestral traits. This means that a single-point mutation is responsible for both acquiring the novel function and losing the ancestral one. By preventing the replication of hosts having more than one trait, we might bias the evolutionary trajectories that the host population could follow. However, this represents only 3.67% of the population (i.e. \u2248 239 organisms in a population of \u2248 6500 hosts). Moreover, the fraction of the single-mutant neighbours that are non-viable (i.e. they have genomes that do not allow them to produce offsprings) is smaller when traits also have non-adaptive origins (28%) than when they have only adaptive origins (31%; see electronic supplementary material, figure S1). This reduction in host population abundance introduced by new mutations is 10 orders of magnitude larger than the 3.67% decrease in host population size artificially induced by our experimental design when traits have only adaptive origins (i.e. preventing the replication of hosts having more than one trait). Therefore, the slowing down in the host evolutionary potential when traits have only adaptive origins, comes naturally from the coevolutionary process and not as much from our experimental procedure to prevent exaptations. 3. Results Evolutionary innovations that emerged as exaptations\u2014adaptive traits that were not adaptive when they originated\u2014influenced the coevolutionary dynamics among host and parasite digital organisms ( figure 2 ).

It was established that the ignition criteria are almost identical only at relatively small values of Todes parameter. Otherwise, the results of critical conditions analysis on the plane temperature\u2013conversion degree may be wrong. The asymptotic method of critical conditions calculation for the first-order reactions was proposed (taking into account the reactant consumption). The degeneration conditions of TE were determined. The calculation of critical conditions for specific first-order reaction was made. The comparison of the analytical results obtained with the results of numerical calculations and experimental data showed that they are in good agreement. 1. Introduction The problem of determination of critical ignition conditions for various explosives is one of the most relevant in the theory of combustion. It should be noted that the accounting of reactant consumption during preheating is the most complex aspect of this problem. It is well known that the chemical reaction kinetics is not taken into account in the classical thermal explosion (TE) theory [ 1 ]. This approximation is quite reasonable in the case when the small reactants consumption leads to significant heat release and fast increase in chemical reaction rate. The inclusion of reaction kinetics leads to the significant mathematical problems in terms of the joint consideration of the heat conduction equation (heat balance equation) and equation of the product formation. In this situation, the classical conditions of TE are not universal and the calculation of critical conditions requires an individual approach in accordance with the kind of kinetic function. From the point of view of the modern numerical simulation methods, it is not a serious problem. However, if we deal with the multi-dimensional and multi-parametric problem, the application of these methods is limited and they do not give the general and comprehensive notion of the relationship between parameters on the ignition limit. The problem becomes much more complicated when we consider an arbitrary kinetic function. In terms of the homogeneous exothermic reactions with reactant consumption, the method of integral manifolds is one of the most known mathematical methods of TE critical conditions determination. Development of this method began in the 1960s of the last century due to the well-known work [ 2 ]. The method consists in considering the behaviour of phase trajectories on the plane temperature\u2013reactant concentration [ 3 , 4 ]. In this case, the critical conditions are determined by the qualitative (abrupt) change of the structure of phase trajectory with the appearance of inflection point. The calculation of the corresponding critical trajectory is determined by the general methods of asymptotic solutions of nonlinear differential equations with small parameter (integral manifolds) [ 5 , 6 ]. In the works [ 7 \u2013 9 ], the alternative method of maximum temperatures which is based on the solution of nonlinear integral equations was proposed. With the use of this method, the algebraic set of equations for TE critical conditions determination for any kind of kinetic function was obtained. The analysis of this set showed the satisfactory agreement with results of numerical calculation and experimental data for the second-order reactions. In this work, the comparative analysis of the method proposed and integral manifolds method was made. The TE critical conditions for the first-order reactions and degeneration conditions were analysed. The critical ignition conditions for specific first-order reaction were considered.

( a ) A 4-cycle around two chambers sharing the 0-vertex and the 2-vertex and all chambers sharing an edge of the cycle. ( b ) The corresponding area in the tiling after an example lsp operation has been applied. For a cycle e 0 ,\u2026, e k in B O ( P ) , let C ( e 0 ),\u2026, C ( e k )= C 0 ,\u2026, C k be the cyclic sequence of chambers of B P , so that, for 0\u2264 i \u2264 k , edge e i is contained in C ( e i ). As long as the sequence of chambers has more than one chamber and we have C i = C i +1 for some i with the indices taken modulo k +1, we can remove C i (and renumber the chambers). This way we get the reduced sequence C 0 ,\u2026, C m . Let now e 0 ,\u2026, e k be a cycle in B O ( P ) with length at most 4. The reduced sequence C 0 ,\u2026, C m also has length m +1\u22644. If m +1\u22642, the cycle is completely contained in one chamber or in two chambers sharing an edge. As the image of e 0 ,\u2026, e k under \u03d5 is a cycle of the same length, it must satisfy the requirements described in (i)\u2013(iii), hence also e 0 ,\u2026, e k must satisfy these requirements. Assume now that m +1\u22653. Depending on whether e 0 ,\u2026, e k crosses the border between two chambers in a vertex or an edge, for 0\u2264 i \u2264 m the chambers C i and C i +1 (with the indices modulo m +1) share one or two vertices. Furthermore, each C i shares in total at least two vertices with the others. Checking the different configurations of three or four chambers in a chamber system that have these properties, one can prove that there is a cycle Z of length m +1\u22653 in B P with an edge in each of C 0 ,\u2026, C m . If m =2, Z is the boundary of a chamber in B P . This implies that the cycle e 0 ,\u2026, e k lies completely in the region described by a chamber C of B P and the chambers sharing an edge with C , so that again the cycle together with its interior can be mapped into the tiling by an isomorphism. If m =3, Z must either be the boundary of the union of two chambers sharing an edge or the boundary of the union of four chambers sharing a 1-vertex. In each case, we can map the interior of Z and the decoration of chambers neighbouring Z isomorphically into the tiling, which implies that e 0 ,\u2026, e 4 satisfies property (iii). Together these observations imply that B O ( P ) fulflls (i)\u2013(iii) and that O ( P ) is 3-connected.\u2003\u25a1 (a) A first step towards general local operations preserving orientation-preserving symmetries but not necessarily orientation-reversing automorphisms The emphasis of this paper is on the work of Goldberg, Fuller, Caspar & Klug, and on operations preserving all symmetries. General operations that preserve orientation-preserving automorphisms but not necessarily orientation-reversing automorphisms can be described in a similar way. In the case of Goldberg, these operations could be described by two subdivisions\u2014one of a black triangle and one of a white. However, such a description is not always possible, and it is necessary to describe how a quadrangle containing a white and a black triangle that share an edge must be subdivided. Details will be presented in a later paper, but a first sketch is provided as electronic supplementary material. 6. Conclusion and future work We have described the differences between the approaches of Goldberg, Fuller and Caspar and Klug. We have also made clear that what is generally referred to as the Goldberg-Coxeter operation is due to Caspar and Klug. Furthermore, we have explained the error in Goldberg\u2019s paper and how it can be corrected. By exactly defining\u2014based on Goldberg\u2019s approach\u2014local symmetry-preserving operations (lsp), it becomes possible not only to study specific operations but also to study the classes of all such operations. This definition makes it possible to design general proofs instead of examining each operation individually (theorem 5.2 is an example for this). The results presented in this paper also open new fields for investigation. Here are some examples: Definition 6.1 Two operations O , O \u2032 are called equivalent if, for all polyhedra P , the results of applying O and O \u2032 to P are isomorphic. While it is immediately evident that there are non-equivalent operations O , O \u2032 that produce isomorphic results for some polyhedra and non-isomorphic results for others (see, for example, the operations identity and dual applied to self-dual versus not self-dual polyhedra), it is not clear how exceptional these cases are. Thus we have the following question: Are self-dual polyhedra the only polyhedra for which the application of non-equivalent operations can give isomorphic results? This last question seems to be related to another one: lsp operations preserve the symmetry group of the polyhedron to which they are applied. In some cases they can also add new symmetries. An example is the operation ambo applied to self-dual polyhedra. By studying lsp operations applied to tilings of the torus, it is easy to see that there exist operations that can increase symmetry but cannot be written as a product of other operations involving ambo . Consider, for example, a 4-regular toroidal tiling with 4-gons with automorphism group Z n \u00d7 Z n . If we apply the lsp operation that subdivides each 4-gon into nine smaller 4-gons in a 3\u00d73 pattern, we get the automorphism group Z 3 n \u00d7 Z 3 n . The number of chambers grows by a factor of 9, while for all products with ambo the numbers of chambers grow by an even factor\u2014so the operation cannot be written as a product of ambo and other operations. Nevertheless, such examples are not known for polyhedra. Thus we have the following question: Can all lsp operations that can increase the number of symmetries of a polyhedron be written as a product of operations involving ambo ? To measure the impact of an operation O on the size or complexity of a polyhedron, the ratios of the numbers of vertices or faces before and after applying the operation are not good measures, as they do not depend on the operation alone. This can already be seen at the example of the operation dual . Focusing on the edges of the polyhedra, we get such an invariant: the inflation rate g ( O ), defined as the number of edges after applying the operation to a polyhedron divided by the number of edges before the operation, is an invariant of the operation. It is equal to the number we would get by counting chambers before and after the operation or by counting the number of chambers in an lsp operation O . Thus we have the following task: Develop a computer program that can generate all non-equivalent lsp operations for a given inflation rate. Of course one could also ask for operations with a given inflation rate that produce only polyhedra with a given degree of the vertices or given face sizes. Symmetric polyhedra and periodic tilings can be seen as containing redundant information, as all the information is given by the structure of the fundamental domain and the symmetry group distributing this information. This interpretation would not describe polyhedra with a trivial symmetry group as redundant, but the situation is very similar to that of subdivisions of chambers in the role of the fundamental domain and polyhedra in the role of the group: when we apply operations with a large inflation factor to polyhedra with a trivial symmetry group, in most cases the product will have a trivial symmetry group too and the information of the operation\u2014the subdivided chamber\u2014is distributed via the chamber system of the polyhedron. Thus we have the following task: Develop an efficient algorithm that can determine whether a given polyhedron can be described as an operation with inflation factor g >1 on a smaller polyhedron.

Here, we provide a guide to the visualization of misorientation data in three-dimensional vector spaces, reduced by crystal symmetry, to reveal crystallographic orientation relationships. Domains for all point group symmetries are presented and an analysis methodology is developed and applied to identify crystallographic relationships, indicated by clusters in the misorientation space, in examples from materials science and geology. This analysis aids the determination of active deformation mechanisms and evaluation of cluster centres and spread enables more accurate description of transformation processes supporting arguments regarding provenance. 1. Introduction Multiphase polycrystalline materials generally contain numerous crystals with different crystal structures. The orientations [ 1 \u2013 3 ] of these crystals and relationships between them [ 4 , 5 ] are important for understanding macroscopic properties [ 6 \u2013 8 ] and microstructural transformation pathways [ 9 \u2013 12 ]. The relationships between crystals are specified by the misorientation (rotation) between adjacent crystals as well as the interface boundary where they join [ 4 ]. Such a relationship may therefore be parametrized [ 13 ] in terms of three misorientation parameters relating the crystal orientations and, when the interface can be approximated as planar, two interface parameters. This leads to a five-parameter description of a crystallographic relationship [ 4 , 14 , 15 ]. Here, the focus is on the three misorientation parameters [ 16 , 17 ]. Misorientations, between crystals of the same or different phases, often occur repeatedly near to particular values. This is typically the result of special crystallographic orientation relationships arising due to the transformation pathway [ 9 , 10 , 12 ]. Discovering and categorizing these orientation relationships is, therefore, an important element of rationalizing microstructure in materials science. A significant class of orientation relationship results in approximately coincident lattice points when the lattices associated with each crystal are interleaved. These are known as a coincident site lattice (CSL) relationships [ 6 , 18 \u2013 21 ]. The occurrence of exact CSLs in three-dimensional (3D) is quite restricted in non-cubic materials (except for special axial ratios) [ 4 , 21 \u2013 23 ], but near CSL misorientations often turn out to be significant [ 24 ]. Another special class of orientation relationship may be described by a simple rotation of 180\u00b0 and is known as a twinning relationship [ 6 , 25 , 26 ]. Both of these concepts are invoked in this paper to categorize misorientations. Orientation relationships can often be well approximated by geometrically simple models expressed as parallelisms between low-index crystallographic planes and directions [ 27 ]. Data analysis have traditionally been approached similarly, by attempting to find common poles, e.g. in pole figures. The parallelism description neglects the experimental fact that there is inevitably some spread in measured misorientations. Importantly, this is not only due to errors but also due to local distortions in the microstructure. Furthermore, in some cases, relationships arising due to a phase transformation are necessarily poorly described by low-index parallelisms [ 28 ]. Analysis based on the axis and angle of rotation [ 4 , 17 , 29 \u2013 34 ], on which this work builds, changes this paradigm. Crystallographic mapping experiments reveal the phases present and crystal orientations in a spatially resolved manner [ 35 ]. Such mapping may be achieved using a number of X-ray [ 36 \u2013 38 ] and electron diffraction [ 39 \u2013 42 ] techniques, which routinely yield many thousands of measurements. Analysing these data to maximize the potential for physical insight remains challenging and has been addressed in the extensively literature [ 1 \u2013 3 , 43 ]. This paper draws particularly on the insight of Frank [ 44 ], who noted that orientation mapping experiments result in \u2018a practical need for comprehensible displays of complete orientation statistics. To degrade that information to pole figures, showing the statistics of orientation of crystal planes, and not crystals, is a criminal disregard of significant information\u2019. This triggered interest in 3-vector representations of crystal orientations [ 4 , 17 , 29 \u2013 34 ], defining 3D spaces in which to plot the data. The influence of symmetry on the relevant domains of these 3D vector spaces for misorientations has since been studied particularly by Morawiec & Patala [ 16 , 17 , 43 ]. However, there has been relatively little application of 3D vector spaces in the analysis of experimental data, especially in the context of revealing crystallographic orientation relationships between low-symmetry crystals of different phases. Computational advances and the growth of open source packages [ 45 \u2013 47 ] now make analysis in 3D orientation space accessible. This paper is intended as a practical guide to 3D orientation spaces with the ultimate goal of revealing crystallographic relationships in multiphase materials. This analysis preserves intrinsic spread in measured values and methods are also developed to explore potential links between particular orientation relationships and spatial occurrence. A review of key concepts in orientation analysis is presented in \u00a7 2 , followed by a discussion of the application of crystallographic symmetry to the 3D orientation spaces in \u00a7 3 . Examples from materials and earth sciences demonstrating application of 3D orientation spaces to glean physical insight are then presented in \u00a7 4 . Details of the calculations performed and important conventions are provided as appendices. All analysis was performed in the matlab toolbox MTEX [ 45 ] and scripts are provided as electronic supplementary material at [ 48 ]. 2. Orientations and misorientations Crystallographic orientation maps describe, at each position, the crystallographic phase and the directions of the crystallographic basis vectors. Coordinate systems are introduced to specify these directions in terms of a specimen reference frame , r , and crystal reference frames , h i . The local orientation may then be described as a transformation between coordinate systems. Conventionally, the reference frames introduced are orthonormal, 1 right-handed, and share the same origin to simplify the description.

The algorithm is based on a relation between the Laplace\u2013Beltrami Green function and the heat kernel. The algorithm is used to compute the motion of a vortex on the Bolza surface. This is the first determination of the orbits of a vortex on a closed surface of genus greater than one. The numerical results show that all the 46 vortex equilibria can be explicitly computed using the symmetries of the Bolza surface. Some of these equilibria allow for the construction of the first two examples of infinite vortex crystals on the hyperbolic disc. The following theorem is proved: \u2018a Weierstrass point of a hyperellitic surface of constant curvature is always a vortex equilibrium\u2019. 1. Introduction The motion of point vortices on the plane has been studied since the nineteenth century. The theory, initiated by Helmholtz, Kelvin, Kirchhoff and others, relies upon the theorems of conservation of vorticity and circulation. The study of the motion of point vortices on curved surfaces started in 1902 with Zermelo [ 1 ], who considered vortices on a sphere embedded in R 3 . It was only at the end of the twentieth century that the equations for motion of point vortices on a general curved surface were written and begun to be investigated, although many particular examples were worked out before. Borisov et al. [ 1 , 2 ] have written historical reviews on the early research on hydrodynamic vortices on surfaces and [ 3 ], besides reviewing the subject, has an extensive bibliography. The motion of vortices on closed surfaces of genus zero has been investigated by many authors; see, for instance, [ 2 , 4 ] for vortices on Euclidean spheres, [ 5 ] for vortices on surfaces of revolution and for an interesting procedure to find Green\u2019s function on closed surfaces of genus zero, [ 6 , 7 ] for vortices on flat tori and [ 8 , 9 ] for vortices on tori of revolution. Most of these works deal with the interaction between point vortices. Two of these papers [ 5 , 8 ] study the effects of the variation of the curvature: on the dynamics of pairs of vortices [ 8 ] and on the stability of equilibria of systems of vortices [ 5 ]. The interaction of a single vortex with the underlying geometry and with the constant background vorticity is studied in [ 5 ] (see appendix B) and in [ 3 ]. A single point vortex in a bounded domain in the Euclidean plane interacts with the boundary, or with an \u2018image vortex\u2019, and moves. Similarly a vortex on a curved surface interacts with the underlying geometry and moves. As a single vortex does not move: on the round sphere, on any flat torus, on the Euclidean plane or on the hyperbolic disc, the interaction of the vortex with the geometry could be thought to depend on the variation of the curvature rather than on the curvature itself, as claimed in the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of the very good paper by Dritschel & Boatto [ 5 ]: \u2018In the absence of boundaries, the Robin function plays a role only on surfaces of variable curvature\u2019 (this is true for closed surfaces of genus zero, the focus of [ 5 ]). In this context, the main contribution of this paper is to show that the topology of the closed surface, a global property, plays an important role in the interaction of the vortex with the underlying geometry and with the constant background vorticity: a single vortex can move even if the curvature is constant but the genus has to be greater than one (this result was first conjectured by Boatto & Koiller [ 3 ] (\u00a74.2)). Closed surfaces of constant negative curvature have been intensively studied within the physics community in spite of the fact that they cannot be realized (isometrically immersed) in R 3 (see [ 10 ] Ch. 5 Th. 12). The reason for this is that the inertial motion of a massive particle in a surface of this kind, although extremely chaotic, can be mathematically described in simple terms. Thus the system has been used as a model for studies in statistical mechanics and ergodic theory [ 11 ] and classical and quantum mechanics [ 12 , 13 ]. Euler\u2019s equation of hydrodynamics describes the collective inertial motion of fluid particles under the sole constraint of incompressibility, so it is reasonable to expect that surfaces of constant negative curvature may be as important in hydrodynamics as they are in the theory of mechanical systems (see, for instance, [ 14 ], section V4D, for a dynamo construction). The aim of this paper is to present a numerical algorithm for the computation of the motion of one vortex on closed surfaces of constant negative curvature. The algorithm is used to compute the motion of a vortex on the Bolza surface [ 15 ], the simplest possible surface of constant negative curvature, having the least genus equal to two and also the most symmetrical fundamental domain. The symmetries of the surface are important to reduce the time of computation and to check the accuracy of the code, because the computed solutions must manifest the symmetries. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the background material and the algorithm for the computation of vortex motion. Section 3 contains basic results on symmetries and involutions, with their implications for the existence of equilibria for vortex motion, and a theorem that relates the so-called Weierstrass points of a hyperelliptic surface of constant curvature to vortex equilibria. In \u00a7 4 , the algorithm of \u00a7 2 and the results in \u00a7 3 are applied to the Bolza surface. The figures in \u00a7 4 show the phase portrait of the vortex motion; they represent and summarize the main contributions of this paper. Finally, in \u00a7 5 some questions are presented and the results in the paper are used to construct the first two examples of infinite steady vortex crystals (vortex patterns that move without change of shape or size [ 16 ]) on the hyperbolic disc. 2. An algorithm to compute the equations of motion of a single vortex on a compact surface of constant negative curvature The derivation of the equations of motion for vortices on curved surfaces follows closely that of vortices on the plane (see, for instance, [ 3 , 17 , 18 ] for different derivations, the later ones as weak solutions to Euler\u2019s equations). In this paper, we are only interested in the motion of a single vortex on a closed surface, hence only the equation for this special case will be presented. Let S be a closed Riemannian surface and \u03bc be the area form associated with the metric on S . The Dirac \u03b4 p -function on S is the linear functional on the space of smooth two-forms such that: \u222b", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dirac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelvin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helmholtz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "euler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "borisov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dritschel & boatto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boatto & koiller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirchhoff", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bolza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beltrami green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laplace", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-27T03:13:52.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a96fd2afe68ad4ed05015e9dae5f35e7b8f5b054", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmm8.Ci1BSApzYs2zYNJJBj.hge6.G912tzIPq2v4tNWWw--", "site_full": "rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org", "site": "royalsocietypublishing.org", "site_section": "http://highwire.stanford.edu/rss/journalsbydate.xml", "site_categories": ["science", "chemistry", "education", "physics"], "section_title": "HighWire-hosted journals, sorted by date of last publication", "title": "Royal Society Open Science", "title_full": "Royal Society Open Science", "published": "2017-10-25T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45018, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a96fd2afe68ad4ed05015e9dae5f35e7b8f5b054", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmm8.Ci1BSApzYs2zYNJJBj.hge6.G912tzIPq2v4tNWWw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-25T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Royal Society Open Science", "text": "Modelling pyruvate dehydrogenase under hypoxia and its role in cancer metabolism Filmon Eyassu , Claudio Angione", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "filmon eyassu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cla", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-27T11:18:02.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "660d453f7aa98ad520808d995eab613867cc07c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmnElK7x7D7_j2U2s745gGrTK2sJhipU0UYFhmPTuiYpJ88ppkZKihi.FWKg7t0.l2rUkUVHJ2uzC1AALfHnKd2e", "site_full": "rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org", "site": "royalsocietypublishing.org", "site_section": "http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/rss/current.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences current issue", "title": "Three-dimensional quasi-periodic shifted Green function throughout the spectrum, including Wood anomalies", "title_full": "Three-dimensional quasi-periodic shifted Green function throughout the spectrum, including Wood anomalies", "published": "2017-11-01T11:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/sites/default/files/highwire/royprsa/473/2207.cover-source.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45018, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "660d453f7aa98ad520808d995eab613867cc07c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmnElK7x7D7_j2U2s745gGrTK2sJhipU0UYFhmPTuiYpJ88ppkZKihi.FWKg7t0.l2rUkUVHJ2uzC1AALfHnKd2e", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bruno, O.

At these frequencies, there is a grazing Rayleigh wave, and the quasi-periodic Green function ceases to exist. We present a modification of the Green function by adding two types of terms to its lattice sum. The first type are transversely shifted Green functions with coefficients that annihilate the growth in the original lattice sum and yield algebraic convergence. The second type are quasi-periodic plane wave solutions of the Helmholtz equation which reinstate certain necessary grazing modes without leading to blow-up at Wood anomalies. Using the new quasi-periodic Green function, we establish, for the first time, that the Dirichlet problem of scattering by a smooth doubly periodic scattering surface at a Wood frequency is uniquely solvable. We also present an efficient high-order numerical method based on this new Green function for scattering by doubly periodic surfaces at and around Wood frequencies. We believe this is the first solver able to handle Wood frequencies for doubly periodic scattering problems in three dimensions. We demonstrate the method by applying it to acoustic scattering.

The approach combines 3D X-ray diffraction and X-ray computed tomography to measure grain-resolved strains, kinematics and contact fabric in the bulk of a granular solid, from which continuum strains, grain stresses, interparticle forces and coarse-grained elasto-plastic moduli can be determined. We demonstrate the experimental approach and analysis of selected results on a sample of 1099 stiff, frictional grains undergoing multiple uniaxial compression cycles. We investigate the inter-particle force network, elasto-plastic moduli and associated length scales, reversibility of mechanical responses during cyclic loading, the statistics of microscopic responses and microstructure\u2013property relationships. This work serves to highlight both the fundamental insight into granular mechanics that is furnished by combined X-ray measurements and describes future directions in the field of granular materials that can be pursued with such approaches.

However, interactions with other organisms, such as pollinators, also have the potential to influence plant distributions. To investigate this, we developed niche models for 32 plant taxa that have specialized pollination systems and which are native to a biodiversity hotspot (South Africa). We found that the distributions of these taxa are best explained by a combination of biotic (pollinators) and abiotic factors, rather than by abiotic factors alone. For approximately 66% of these plant taxa, pollinator distributions were the factor that provided the best predictor of their niches. Furthermore, co-occurrence of these plants and their pollinators was generally not explained solely by shared abiotic niches, and thus probably reflects broad-scale positive ecological interactions. These results are consistent with the proposal that pollinator distributions may constrain plant distributions and highlight the general potential for species distributions to be shaped by positive interactions with other species. This has important consequences for predicting how distributions of species might change in the face of loss of their key mutualists.

Here we identified the cAMP-producing enzyme soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) as the first molecular pH sensor in corals. sAC protein was detected throughout coral tissues, including those involved in symbiosis and calcification. Application of a sAC-specific inhibitor caused significant and reversible pHi acidosis in isolated coral cells under both dark and light conditions, indicating sAC is essential for sensing and regulating pHi perturbations caused by respiration and photosynthesis. Furthermore, pHi regulation during external acidification was also dependent on sAC activity. Thus, sAC is a sensor and regulator of pH disturbances from both metabolic and external origin in corals. Since sAC is present in all coral cell types, and the cAMP pathway can regulate virtually every aspect of cell physiology through post-translational modifications of proteins, sAC is likely to trigger multiple homeostatic mechanisms in response to pH disturbances. This is also the first evidence that sAC modulates pHi in any non-mammalian animal. Since corals are basal metazoans, our results indicate this function is evolutionarily conserved across animals.
