And this can put the same undue stress on your feet and body, as it does for the industrial worker.\nIf you have very hard surface floors like ceramic tile, even one standing hour can be grueling.\nThe solution is a properly suited and well-designed anti-fatigue mat that can reduce foot stress and related back and knee problems. But with so many choices on the market, it can be difficult to find the right one for your particular needs. Hopefully, these tips will better equip you when it comes to buying an anti-fatigue mat.\nDo You Need an Anti-Fatigue Mat? Let's face it, it's always nice to step onto a soft and comfy mat when you rise from the bed or you're standing at the bathroom sink. But while softness and light cushioning may seem comfortable, it may not be adequate to reduce the risk of stress and foot fatigue, when it comes to standing in the same spot for an hour or more. This type of cushioning is limited in terms of shock-absorbing and stress-relieving qualities. When you need more than soft cushioning, it's time for an anti-fatigue mat.\nAnyone who suffers from foot, knee or back pain should consider some type of anti-fatigue mat, to reduce the stress on the body caused by standing for any length of time at the kitchen counter , bathroom sink or workbench.\nThe average cook or home chef can benefit greatly from an anti-fatigue mat to prevent foot stress problems.\nAnd for those who spend hours standing such as the car or hobby buffs, busy cooks, home-based caterers or professional cooks, an anti-fatigue mat is essential.\nRegular Floor Mats vs Anti-Fatigue Mats When a little cushioning is all that's needed, carpeted mats are probably the most economical and may be sufficient for light duty if they have a rubber backing for safety. But make sure that they are washable and will withstand many washings. There's also a good array of rubber or foam vinyl-covered mats for home use, but these may lack anti-fatigue properties and simply provide light cushioning. Rubber interlocking mats sold in hardware stores for workshops or play areas can also be very practical and economical for light duty, depending on use.\nWhat about gel mats? They're certainly worth considering for light duty. Many people love their gel-filled shoe insoles, so this concept can certainly be extended to the kitchen. It's really a matter of taste and how it feels for you. Gel-filled anti-fatigue mats tend to be much higher priced and this may be a constraint. Because kitchen mats may feel great for one person and not another, keep in mind that it may take trial and error to find the right one for you.\nAnti-fatigue mats generally have some stress relieving qualities, but not all are equal in terms of materials, features, and benefits. Some are considered light duty, while others have industrial-grade properties that make them better suited for heavy-duty use. And for those who spend hours in the kitchen or home shop, this is the type of anti-fatigue mat you need.\nAn industrial-grade anti-fatigue mat should be at least 3/8\" thick and constructed with special properties to alleviate foot stress. See below for more information on density. Look for a top pattern that is easy to wipe clean and suitable sizing for your area. Though a heavy duty anti-fatigue mat may not be as pretty as some kitchen mats, remember that it's the quality that counts, and that's a small trade-off when it comes to easing foot pain.\nBlack is easiest to find; colors are more limited. Be prepared to pay for this grade of the mat; they're usually more expensive.\nBuy at Amazon Check prices of interlocking mats at Amazon Check prices of kitchen mats at Amazon Sanitary & Safety Issues Regardless of whether you choose a mat simply based on light cushioning or heavy duty use, if the mat is for your kitchen or bath area, for sanitary reasons it must be washable. Kitchen mats can harbor food bacteria and bathroom mats are prone to germs and should be cleaned regularly.\nAn anti-fatigue mat with a grid or highly pebbled surface is great for industrial use where it can be hosed down but might be hard to keep clean in the kitchen. When a mat's top layer becomes cracked or peels, cleaning becomes ineffective and the mat should be replaced. Read the product information and for health reasons, make sure you can wash or sanitize it.\nTo avoid tripping hazards, choose a mat with tapered edges that do not hinder the transition from floor to mat. And balancing on a soft foam mat can also pose a falling hazard to those with stability issues such as seniors.\nThickness, Density & Elements of Anti-Fatigue Mats A dense rubber mat is less tiring than a soft mat and will provide better support. But there's more to consider when it comes to density and a well-designed anti-fatigue mat will be engineered based on key elements that are known to alleviate foot fatigue. Adding a vinyl cover to a foam construction may be fine for a comfy feel, but when you want to reduce foot fatigue, it's just not enough.\nA foam mat that is too soft may look and feel nice at first step, but you will be constantly balancing on the mat, similar to walking on sand. That can be extremely fatiguing in the long run. This balancing act also improperly shifts the weight and that can lead to misalignment health issues. For chefs who spend hours cooking or baking, this type is too light to provide a good cushioning.\nMats that are at least 3/8\", 1/2\" or closer to 1\" thick would be best, but not too high to create a tripping hazard.\nThe best mats will also have a tapered edge to prevent tripping hazards and the wider the taper, the better.\nAccording to SmartCells U.S.A. , their \"SmartCells anti-fatigue technology is based on valid, time-tested research, not emotional market-tested buzz words\". You'll find some interesting facts and a research paper called the 9 Essential Questions to Ask Before Buying an Anti-Fatigue Mat on their site. This is a very interesting read and it outlines some key elements that should be present in a good anti-fatigue mat. You'll also find expert information on anti-fatigue mat construction that will help with your buying decision.\nThe bottom line: If you've already experienced foot, knee or back pain and you stand for hours, a lightweight mat will probably be inadequate. Go for an industrial grade mat with essential features to reduce foot strain, such as a SmartCells mat .\nMat Size Considerations\nFor industrial use, a square mat or long runner may be great, but for counter use, look for a rectangular mat at least 2' x 3' long, or if you have a long counter a 6' - 8' longer mat would be ideal. The worst thing is constantly stepping on and off of a mat when working in the kitchen, so chose the size carefully. You should also avoid positioning a mat where you are likely to be standing one foot on and one foot off, which would lead to posture issues. Measure the counter area where you are likely to spend most of your time and bring these measurements with you when you shop.\nFor industrial use, a square mat or long runner may be great, but for counter use, look for a rectangular mat at least 2' x 3' long, or if you have a long counter a 6' - 8' longer mat would be ideal.

Here\u2019s how to improve your closet a lot in a little time.\nBefore your begin, review your closet organization toolkit to make sure you have everything you need before you begin.\n1. Distract yourself. Not too much, but enough to take the boring part out of closet-cleaning. While you\u2019re de-cluttering, listen to music or watch ... MORE something less than completely engrossing on TV. You don\u2019t want to abandon your closet for something more entertaining, you just want to make de-cluttering as enjoyable a process as possible. (If it weren\u2019t for playlists and headphones, my usually very neat apartment might be a mess.)\n2. Start at the bottom. The floor of the closet is the least interesting part, as well as the place most likely to be harboring stuff that really belong in some other room or ice skates from 1989 that you forgot you owned. Take everything off the closet floor, give it a quick vacuum or sweep, then place every item back neatly, or move it to another room, a bag of trash or donations, or wherever else it should go.\n3. Do a very quick clothing assessment. You don\u2019t have to carefully consider each piece at this point, but scan the clothes hanging in your closet and see if anything jumps out at you and says \u201cI do not belong here.\u201d You\u2019ll probably spot one or two things you\u2019d been meaning to get rid of anyway. Through them in your donation box .\n4. Take one additional quick look. After your immediate \u201cno\u2019s\u201d have been removed, touch each hanger for a second and decide if you want to keep what\u2019s on it. You\u2019re not doing any kind of deep thinking here; if you\u2019re uncertain, keep the item for now. But looking at each piece of clothing individually for just a brief moment might turn up several more things you don\u2019t need.\n5. Straighten up. Now that you\u2019ve (hopefully) removed some things from your hangers, go through them again and make sure everything is facing the same way and nothing is falling off its hanger.\nContinue to 2 of 2 below. 02 of 02 Quickly Decluttering Your Closet Decluttering the closet. Getty 6. Repeat with shelves. If your closet has any shelving in addition to a hanger rod, repeat steps 3, 4, and 5 with the items on the shelves.\n7. Take notes. You may have realized some things while de-cluttering. Perhaps you need to buy more hangers, or you suddenly realized you have no black pants but you need them. You don\u2019t have to take any action now \u2013 this is just a 30 minute project after all \u2013 but jot down any ideas you had while in the closet so that you can take care of them later.\n8. Now ... MORE turn to the closet door. Go through anything that\u2019s hanging either inside or outside the door, remove anything you no longer want to be there, and straighten up what\u2019s left. Need to buy any hooks? Add that to your list.\nIf you still have time left, here are some bonus closet organization steps you can take:\n9. Clothes by type. If you still have time, go back to your clothes and organize them by type (all pants together, all dresses together, etc.) and then by color. This makes it even easier to find what you\u2019re looking for and see everything you own. (Here's more on how to sort and store clothing by type and size .)\n10. Look for pieces to fix. While on step 9, look at each piece for obvious stains or rips, and to jog your memory about anything you might want to hem or have tailored. Take those things out and place them somewhere where you\u2019ll notice them and deal with them later.\n11. Accessories. If you didn\u2019t include accessories like belts, shoes, and bags in your initial de-cluttering sweep, do them now. Place any obvious \u201cno\u2019s\u201d in a bag for throwing away or donating and put shoes that need fixing in a bag to take to the cobbler. Line up all your footwear so it\u2019s facing the same direction. Go through your bags to make sure there\u2019s nothing gross (used tissues) or useful (money) hiding in any compartments.\n12. Loose ends. Go back to your clothes and check them again, this time for things like a belt left in a pair of pants, a pin left on a jacket, or anything left in any pocket.\n(Ready for more decluttering?

Here are some tips and tricks for packing away your out-of-season wardrobe.\n01 of 04 Tip: How to Prepare Your Winter Clothing for Storing It takes a little prep work to store winter clothing correctly. Here's where to start:\nEdit, edit, edit: Are you holding on to sweaters and coats you haven't worn in years? Do you have a collection of mismatched gloves and leaky boots? The latter items should be pitched. Wearable items that are in gently worn condition should be donated. Clean clothing and footwear: Your winter gear must be cleaned before storing. Soiled items that can't be washed or dry cleaned like winter shoes and ... MORE boots should be wiped or brushed. Doing so will prevent dirt from setting into your stuff. Take steps to repel pests: Prevent moths from munching on your stored sweaters with an eco-friendly moth repellent. You buy cedar, lavender or cinnamon sachets. If you prefer to DIY check out my Pinterest page. 02 of 04 Trick: Turn Winter Boots into Mini Storage Units In my home, we keep hats, gloves, and scarfs stashed in the IKEA Trones in our entryway during the winter. When spring rolls around those items are used to stuff my tall winter boots so, they keep their shape. Here's how:\nStep 1: I make sure my boots are clean and dry inside and out. This chore involves brushing all the debris from the bottom and wiping down the exterior and interior of each boot.\nStep 2: I place a sachet of baking soda inside each boot and let it sit for 24 hours.\nStep 3: The ... MORE next day I take the sachet out and replace it with a fresh one.\nStep 4: Afterward I line each boot with a thin, clean rag made from an old sheet or shirt.\nStep 5: Next I stuff clean winter hats, scarfs and gloves into airtight food storage bags.\nStep 6: Then I use the filled storage bags to stuff my boots.\nWhen the task is complete, my boots are placed on a shelf in my closet. The shelf is one foot above the floor. I keep my warm weather shoes under the shelf.\n03 of 04 Tip: Vacuum Pack Your Winter Gear You know those vacuum space bags that are used to compress packed clothing? I wasn't a fan for a long time because I couldn't find a great spot to store the filled bags. Then I found the garment bag version of this product. It doubled the hanging space in my closet.\nNote: Space bags have a downside. When you take clothes out, they are super duper wrinkled.\nTip: Got some empty luggage? That's also a great spot to stash space bags filled with clothing. You can also utilize wasted ... MORE space with corner cabinets.\n04 of 04 Trick: Rethink Where You Store Winter Clothing Think you don't have room to spare? Maybe you need to rethink your space.\nKitchen: In my last apartment I stored off-season clothing and shoes in my kitchen cabinets.\nGot a bad view? In my current apartment, I have one deep windowsill that faces a brick wall in the back of my building. We covered the window with a frosted privacy film, and now we use the deep still to store off-season items including clothing, snowboard equipment, and a bicycle. A curtain conceals our smart storage solution.\nTip ...

Goforth/Getty Images A good feng shui headboard is one of the crucial elements of a good feng shui bed . A good headboard will create strong and supportive energy for your bed, which provides for better sleep, as well as an overall sense of being supported in life.\nA weak headboard - or an absence of a headboard altogether - will do the opposite. Feng shui -wise, a weak headboard cannot provide you with the energy of support and stability that we all need. And if that sounds strange, think how much time we spend in ... MORE bed!\nWe are being so mindful about choosing chairs and sofas with good backing (for obvious reasons), but when it comes to a more subtle energetic backing and support, most of us are unaware of the importance of a good feng shui headboard.\nTo help you understand what makes a good feng shui headboard, we've actually created a gallery of bad feng shui headboards. Yes, knowing what to avoid sometimes makes it very easy to know what to go for!\nLet's look at 10 worst feng shui headboards.\nContinue to 2 of 11 below. 02 of 11 White Metal Headboard Philippa Michael/Getty Images Metal headboards are considered undesirable feng shui for many reasons. The first, and most obvious reason is that metal is cold to the touch/has cold energy, and feng shui wise this is not the energy you want in your bed! EMF -wise, metal also tends to have residual magnetism and can even act as a giant antennae (sources: electricsense.com and emfs.com ). Knowing how polluted our bedrooms are with high EMFs, it is wise to avoid a metal headboard in your bedroom .\nNow that you know more about the ... MORE energy of a metal headboard, no matter how pretty this white and feminine headboard looks it is still a bad feng shui headboard. In addition, this headboard also has a very weak energy, basically providing no energetic backing.\nContinue to 3 of 11 below. 03 of 11 Wood Spindles Headboards Image Source/Getty Images While wooden headboards are certainly much better than the metal ones, the design of the headboard is as important as its material. All designs that create \"energetic holes\" or have considerable empty spaces within the space of the headboard are considered weak and not good feng shui . This headboard style is definitely one of them. In addition, this specific design just looks boring and dated, don't you agree?\nContinue to 4 of 11 below. 04 of 11 Custom Made Headboard Andreas Von Einsiedel/Getty Images This particular headboard design might look quite dramatic, as well as clever, considering the positioning of the bed (notice what's happening behind the headboard). However, dramatic and clever is not enough for good feng shui. The energy of this headboard is scattered in pieces, and mirrors the squares on the nearby wall, which makes it even weaker.\nA good feng shui headboard is always a headboard that serves as a focal point , rather than mirrors other design elements in the bedroom , especially ... MORE the elements that are similar in size. The energy of this headboard is scattered and weak; it's the energy of many pieces floating around with no strength, focus or support.\nContinue to 5 of 11 below. 05 of 11 Modern Metal Spindles Headboard Abode/Getty Images Here is another metal headboard that combines two of the worst features, feng shui -wise. it is made from metal (and we've already covered why metal headboards are not good feng shui) and it has one of the worst designs - the metal spindles that can bring to mind either hospital or prison beds. Yes, this particular design is visually way more pleasing and modern than the one we looked at before, but the energy of it is still the same - weak and unsupportive.\nContinue to 6 of 11 below. 06 of 11 Black Headboard with Storage PNC/Getty Images Headboards with storage are never a good idea. Beds with storage in general are considered bad feng shui, and a headboard with storage or display windows like the one pictured here is even worse. It can easily turn into a feng shui nightmare. Displaying or hanging anything above your bed - especially above your head - is really bad feng shui, let alone just does nor make sense energetically. What would you place on that headboard - a vase, a couple books, a photo? What if they all just fall? ... MORE This design is really bad feng shui and defeats the purpose of a good feng shui headboard - to provide energetic strength, support and calm.\nContinue to 7 of 11 below. 07 of 11 Tall Wooden Headboard with Spindles Adobe/Getty Images Here is a headboard design that might look visually pleasing, even beautiful, but energetically it is really weak. The combination of height and spindles design, plus the low positioning of the mattress, creates an unsettling energy that is by no means supportive or nourishing.\nContinue to 8 of 11 below. 08 of 11 Low Headboard with Storage webphotographeer/Getty Images Here is another headboard that, even though with a solid backing - always good feng shui! - it also has storage, which is a pretty bad feature for a bed. Storing things under the bed, or behind the bed, as in this case, creates stagnant and often confusing energy. Why would you want this energy in your bedroom ?\nContinue to 9 of 11 below. 09 of 11 Upholstered Divided Headboard Camilo Morales/Getty Images This headboard design looks visually pleasing, and it is upholstered, too, which in most cases creates an excellent feng shui headboard. However, notice it is divided in two. And yes, you might think this is not that big of a deal, but energetically it is. An ideal feng shui headboard creates strength and provides good backing for the bed, which in turn promotes the energy of unity. This is the energy you want in your bed and in your relationship, isn't it? United, not divided.\nContinue to 10 of 11 below. 10 of 11 Ornate Metal Headboard Abode/Getty Images Here is a headboard that looks beautiful, visually pleasing and even uplifting in a royal kind of way. And it's also not good feng shui. Apart from the fact that it is a metal headboard - and all metal headboards create \"not-so-good\" feng shui in the bedroom - it also has an energy and movement that is more suited for a throne rather than a bed. What makes a good feng shui bed, you might ask? Good question!\nRead: 3 Things That Make a Good Feng Shui Bed\nContinue to 11 of 11 below. 11 of 11 Modern Wooden Headboard Tammy Hanratty/Getty Images And here is another bad feng shui headboard. It looks nice, doesn't it? However, by now you have learned that \"nice\" is not always good feng shui, if the energy that is created by a particular headboard cannot provide energetic support and strength. This headboard is one of those cases - it's good looking, attractive, modern. It can bring character and warmth to any modern bedroom. And, it is not good feng shui .\nNotice how it creates empty spaces - energetic holes - that promote the leakage of ... MORE energy. There is no continuous solidity or a sense of energetic support in this headboard, so it is definitely a headboard design to avoid.\nThis concludes our exploration of bad feng shui headboards; now you

Each title is worth a different number of points. Each word is worth the cumulative amount points of the letters in the word. There are 100 tiles in the English version of the game, and each is worth between zero and 10 points. One of the first things that beginner Scrabble players should learn is the game's tile distribution.\nThe limited number of letters is what makes the game such a fun challenge. Having a large vocabulary isn't enough to guarantee a high score. It's vital to know that, for example, only one J, K, Q, X, and Z are in the bag and that they provide the best opportunities for high scores.\nYou might also want to learn Scrabble's legal words with no vowels , two-letter words and words with a Q but no U , plus other ways to improve your Scrabble play .\nScrabble Tiles Listed by Point Values 0 points: blank/wild\n1 point: E, A, I, O, N, R, T, L, S, U\n2 points: D, G\n3 points: B, C, M, P\n4 points: F, H, V, W, Y\n5 points: K\n8 points: J, X\n10 points: Q, Z\nScrabble Tile Distribution and Point Value Blank/Wild: 2 tiles, 0 points\nA: 9 tiles, 1 point\nB: 2 tiles, 3 points\nC: 2 tiles, 3 points\nD: 4 tiles, 2 points\nE: 12 tiles, 1 point\nF: 2 tiles, 4 points\nG: 3 tiles, 2 points\nH: 2 tiles, 4 points\nI: 9 tiles, 1 point\nJ: 1 tile, 8 points\nK: 1 tile, 5 points\nL: 4 tiles, 1 point\nM: 2 tiles, 3 points\nN: 6 tiles, 1 point\nO: 8 tiles, 1 point\nP: 2 tiles, 3 points\nQ: 1 tile, 10 points\nR: 6 tiles, 1 point\nS: 4 tiles, 1 point\nT: 6 tiles, 1 point\nU: 4 tiles, 1 point\nV: 2 tiles, 4 points\nW: 2 tiles, 4 points\nX: 1 tile, 8 points\nY: 2 tiles, 4 points\nZ: 1 tile, 10 points\nLanguage Differences Scrabble is available for 29 different languages and yes, the language your game is intended for does matter.

In the Afrikaans edition, there are no Z or X tiles because while the letters do exist in the language, they are used so infrequently that it didn't make sense to include them.\nIn the Spanish edition, there are tiles for LL and RR. Players are not allowed to substitute two R tiles for an RR in this edition. Stress accent marks are usually disregarded in Scrabble unless specifically included on the tiles.

It can definitely be difficult to pick the best one. There are so many tablets to choose from.\nThere are many reasons why the nabi SE android tablet from Mattel, for the price and the features offered, is definitely one of the best tablets for kids.\nMany parents and families have different wants and needs when it comes to features that they like and dislike when it comes to buying a kid's tablet.\nChildren can easily lose or damage their tablets. So knowing that, most people do not have a large budget and search for a tablet that is inexpensive, often under $100.\nOther considerations when it comes to choosing the best tablet include:\nCan children access websites on the internet? What kind of parental controls are there? Does the tablet allow the child to watch new movies, television episodes or YouTube Kids videos ? Does it have a quality camera to take pictures and videos? Is there educational and learning software programs programmed on the device? How many games are downloaded on the tablet when you open it from the box? Are they actually good apps that are fun to play? Will I be spending a lot of money on additional apps or in-app purchases? The Nabi Se Is an Android Tablet There are some big differences between android tablets and a learning tablet , like the LeapFrog Platinum . An android tablet is a processor that is often found in many popular smartphones.\nThe android processor allows the software on the tablet to work much faster than other educational toy tablets.\nKids with parents allow them to use their Android smartphone will definitely be familiar with how to use the software on the tablet. However, in general, tech-savvy children will quickly figure out how to access the apps they like very quickly.\nAndroid tablets are a much better option for older children in the elementary school age range. They easily connect to wifi, and they have the look and feel of an adult tablet without being heavy or encased in a lot of plastic, which can make them appear childish.\nAndroid tablets, like the nabi SE, help children make the transition to a more expensive tablet when they are mature. It is very cost effective under $100. Given an Android operating system, the nabi SE can be customized by parents to also include access to popular websites like YouTube with apps to watch movies such as Netflix.\nThe Nabi Se Has Flexible, Customizable Parental Controls The parental controls on the nabi SE available are flexible and customizable. Children have their own profile with their own preferences. Many children can have their own profile on the same device.\nParents enter a secure \"Mommy/Daddy\" mode that is password protected where they can choose to allow or block access to the device, apps, and websites. Apps can also be time limited so that children have a specific time allotment to use the device or app per day. Animated videos appear to alert children before it turns off unexpectedly in order to reduce tantrums.\nParents can also say goodbye to paper chore charts, and assign each child activities to do within the Chores List app. For activities completed, kids can earn rewards or nabi coins. By visiting the Treasure Box, nabi coins can translate into added screen time on the device, or, if a parent provides their credit card information, coins can be redeemed for apps and movies that are purchased.\nThe Nabi Se Has Its Own Social Network Internet safety is very important so children do not end up accessing websites, come into contact with strangers, or meet cyber bullies.\nThe nabi SE has its own social network, and their child's activity can be monitored. Only people who have the child's friend code can interact with them in this network. Parents, grandparents and other adults can connect with them using a free iOS and android app, nabigator.\nUsing nabi Mail, kids can write, draw a picture or take a photo, then email it to a friend or family member int heir network.\nnabi Chat allows kids to send emoticons, pictures, and instant text messages to pre-approved friends on the list, too.\nIf you need to buy a tablet quickly to use for last minute travel or for a gift, within minutes of taking the tablet out of the box, there are many games and activities children can play with.\nGaining access to online content through the wifi on the tablet, by entering Mommy Mode, and downloading additional apps through a Google Play account, is helpful when there is time, out of the box there are many fantastic games to keep kids occupied for some time.\nThe apps include racing games like Riptide, Beach Buggy, and Slingshot. There are several apps and games that include adventure games, coding apps, drawing activities, brain teasers, and interactive books. nabi also offers apps for children that are from popular app companies, like Toca Boca. There are special learning activities and e-books, too.\nThere Are Fun Learning Software, Apps, and Activities The nabi SE also has learning activities in the Wings Learning System app. These games and activities are recommended for kids in pre-Kindergarten through 6th grade. There are over 16,000 questions around reading, math, and writing that are aligned with common core curriculum. The questions will also adapt to the child's abilities. Time spent completing learning activities may be traded in for extra time on the device or more nabi Coins.\nCan It Play Music? The iHeartFamily music app is included on the device and includes 30 different popular songs. The tablet is also Bluetooth compatible for headphones and other speakers so kids can play and listen to music. In the parent section, the popular iHeart Radio App can also be utilized.\nDoes It Take Photos and Videos? The nabi SE has front and rear cameras for photos and videos. The front camera is 3 megapixels, and the rear camera is 2 megapixels.\nMost tablets for kids only include 2 megapixels in both cameras, so the nabi SE has a little higher quality camera than most other learning tablets. Photos can be edited and emailed to people in the nabi Friends network.\nThe Nabi Se Is 2 Tablets in 1, Which Can Be Used by Kids and Their Parents Going on a family trip? The nabi SE might be inexpensive enough to buy one for each child. However, when the kids are asleep, parents can easily use the tablet themselves with their own apps.\nParents switch over to \"Mommy/Daddy Mode\" where they can use Google apps, search for information using Google on the internet, check their email in Gmail, edit and create documents in Drive, watch YouTube, and get directions on Maps. Since it is an android tablet, using the Google Play app, parents can watch movies through Hulu and Netflix and use social sites like Facebook and Instagram. Some access to these apps will require a log-in, a subscription fee.\nFor the price, and with so many included features for kids and adults, the nabi SE tablet is a fantastic kids tablet.\nBuy the nabi SE tablet at Walmart. Other nabi tablets are available at Amazon . There are also other Hot Wheels and Barbie themed nabi tablets, too.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.amazon.com/s/ref&#61;nb_sb_noss_2?url&#61;search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords&#61;nabi&#43;tablet&rh&#61;i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Anabi&#43;tablet", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/hSrS9I7FTPhWldhl2SpCQybhhYo=/735x0/mattel_nabi2_tablet-58122d8e5f9b58564c8d3ecb.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/gSTIEe6OdyTrHpvKGNS6x-TuuCE=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/mattel_nabi2_tablet-58122d8e5f9b58564c8d3ecb.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barbie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mattel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hulu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toca boca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:31:57.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a911de5bc1a38f13ddca85d20297d97e2d2b3311", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3J2UqttxP3PgDoOSHkCYIqwswhOWl_S3Q2zjN13UaXUD1WRf.u4Diqo.BVchIiEVSnmcozv8NrPFo-", "site_full": "www.thespruce.com", "site": "thespruce.com", "site_section": "https://www.thespruce.com/living-family-rooms-ideas-4127966", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Living &amp; Family Room Ideas", "title": "Blue Ideas", "title_full": "Blue Living Room Ideas", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.755, "main_image": "https://fthmb.tqn.com/OUWEtyS4DjYcbEp97hK9l9wl-Aw=/2500x1643/filters:fill(auto,1)/Eclectic-Blue-Living-Room-Erin-Williamson-586e718f5f9b584db36a6115.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a911de5bc1a38f13ddca85d20297d97e2d2b3311", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3J2UqttxP3PgDoOSHkCYIqwswhOWl_S3Q2zjN13UaXUD1WRf.u4Diqo.BVchIiEVSnmcozv8NrPFo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lauren Flanagan", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Blue Ideas", "text": "Erin Williamson 01 of 22 The Best Blue Living Rooms Ann Lowengart Interiors Blue living rooms come in all shapes and sizes. From traditional, to modern, to everything in between, blue is a color that spans across styles like no other. In fact, next to neutrals, there's no easier color to decorate with than blue. So whether your tastes turn to bright and bold, or soft and subtle, these blue living room ideas are sure to provide ample inspiration.\nContinue to 2 of 22 below. 02 of 22 Glossy and Dramatic Thom Filicia , Photo by Zack DeSart Celebrity designer Thom Filicia is known for creating spaces that are classic yet have some sort of unexpected flair that set them apart from the crowd. This blue living room in Greenwich, Connecticut is no exception. One of the most important things to note is that while the paint is a very dark blue, it has a glossy finish which makes it more exciting and vibrant than a matte finish would. Consider this technique when using dark paint colors.\nContinue to 3 of 22 below. 03 of 22 Classic and Restrained Echelon Custom Homes A classic sitting room, like this one designed by Echelon Custom Homes , is the ideal setting for traditional and restrained Wedgwood blue walls. When paired with the white bead board ceiling and light hickory floors the color reads almost as a neutral, yet it still lends enough depth to keep the room feeling robust. The color combined with the room's architectural details prove that a space can have a ton of personality before a single piece of furniture is placed within.\nContinue to 4 of 22 below. 04 of 22 Warm and Cozy Cory Connor Designs , Photo by Red Ranch Studios There's no better color combination than blue and orange. In the case of this warm and cozy blue living room, designer Cory Connor used a dark but vibrant shade as the primary color and then accented it with hits of rusty orange. By painting the built-in bookcases the same color as the grasscloth covered walls, she has created a feeling of intimacy, and there's a sense of being enveloped by this warm and welcoming color.\nContinue to 5 of 22 below. 05 of 22 Clean and Contemporary Alice Burnham Design , photo by Jane Beiles Contrast is key in this transitional living room by Alice Burnham Interior Design . Dark blue grasscloth wallpaper provides the perfect backdrop for two pieces of modern art, while a blue mid-century modern sofa pops against crisp white wainscoting. Despite the use of several dark blues, the room maintains a light, airy feeling thanks to the considered use of white and cream.\nContinue to 6 of 22 below. 06 of 22 Bohemian Casual Domus Nova The calming colors of the sea and sky are perfect for Bohemian style rooms. In this living area almost every single color is a shade of blue, with no real accent colors to speak of. This tone-on-tone look can be tough to pull off, but in this case the huge window and massive amount of natural light coming through provide a break from the single span of color.\nRoom photo courtesy of: Domus Nova\nContinue to 7 of 22 below. 07 of 22 Breezy Beach Style Sabrina Alfin Interiors , Photo by Dean J. Birinyi Photography Designer Sabrina Alfin created a breezy, beach-style retreat by marrying watery blues with sandy neutrals in this San Fransisco Bay area home.

With the the bamboo-style etageres being painted the same color as the walls, they almost appear to be built in and give the room a sense of great architectural depth. The cream sofa practically jumps out from the wall, creating a dynamic focal point.\nContinue to 10 of 22 below. 10 of 22 Calm and Cool Digs Design Company , Photo by Nat Rae A soothing palette of soft blue, grey and white makes for a calming atmosphere in this traditionally-styled living room.

In this room from the 2012 Kips Bay Decorator Showhouse designer Brian del Toro used the eye-catching combination of dark teal and lime to create a striking effect. Unlike navy or indigo, teal has a warmth that adds coziness to dark rooms.\nContinue to 13 of 22 below. 13 of 22 Modern Eclectic Dineen Architecture + Design Eclectic is something of an all encompassing design term, and blue is an all encompassing color, so the two go together in home decor beautifully! In this room designed by Dineen Architecture and Design , the dark blue walls provide a stunning backdrop for a collection of both modern and traditional items.\nContinue to 14 of 22 below. 14 of 22 Funky Traditional Ann Lowengart Interiors According to designer Annie Lowengart , the inspiration for this blue living room came from an antique tapestry done in rich blues and warm ambers. Drawing on that foundation an elegant yet funky living room was born. The feature wall and built in bookcases are painted in Farrow & Ball's Chinese Blue which adds warmth and a bit of playfulness to this wonderfully eclectic living room.\nContinue to 15 of 22 below. 15 of 22 Dark and Moody LGB Interiors , Photo by Robert Clark Deep indigo is a rich and robust color, and depending on how it's used it can be dark and moody, or bold and uplifting. In this room designed by Linda Burnside Interiors it's a bit of both. The color on the walls is quite dark and rich, but the pops used on the light-colored furniture and drapery fabrics add a sense of playfulness.\nContinue to 16 of 22 below. 16 of 22 Subtly Coastal Schell Brothers Light colors are ideal for open, airy spaces like this open concept living room and kitchen designed by Schell Brothers Home Builders. Reminiscent of the sea, the wall color is ideal for rooms trying to acheive a coastal vibe. The addition of sand colored upholstery, a stone hearth, and beadboard ceiling complete the coastal look without being kitschy.\nContinue to 17 of 22 below. 17 of 22 Timeless Beauty Kate FitzGerald Wilks , Photo by Josh Wheeler Blue has been used in interiors for centuries, which is perhaps why so many blue rooms tend to have a timeless quality to them. At least this transitional blue living room by designer Kate FitzGerald-Wilks certainly does. Classic elements like the tufted sofa and nailhead trim definitely play a part, but the particular shade of blue used has a timeless quality that will never go out of style.\nContinue to 18 of 22 below. 18 of 22 Wrapped in Grasscloth J Hensley Services, LLC Paint isn't the only way to infuse walls with a hit of blue.

about a fireplace . We all daydream about spending time curled up by a crackling fire, and even when it's not lit, a fireplace is generally the focal point of a room. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have a space with a fireplace, most of the time, that fireplace will include some sort of mantel. Though they're often not very large, the beauty of a mantel is that it adds another styleable space at the very heart of your room. A well-styled mantel helps elevate the ... MORE look of a fireplace while completing the aesthetic statement of the entire room. Because they command so much attention, mantels are the ideal places to display your very favorite works of art and photography as well as the most captivating pieces of any collection. To help you turn your mantel into the crowning achievement of your favorite room, we\u2019ve put together seven tips that will help make styling the perfect mantel an absolute breeze.\nContinue to 2 of 7 below. 02 of 07 Use Mirrors La Dolce Vita It may seem a little obvious, but mirrors are one of the best objects to use when styling your mantel. A single mirror is able to achieve so much. It creates a focal point, adds some height, and really helps to open up the space.\n[ Image Credit ]\nContinue to 3 of 7 below. 03 of 07 Create Visual Layers SF Girl By Bay Try layering art and photographs on top of one another to accomplish a deep, sophisticated look that is truly unique to your space. Don\u2019t worry about things being perfectly balanced or symmetrical. Simply play around with your art and images until you create a look that feels right. By mixing and matching you\u2019ll create a mantel display that feels organic and effortless.\n[ Image Credit ]\nContinue to 4 of 7 below. 04 of 07 Display Fresh Greenery All The King's Houses Displaying fresh greenery and flowers is a fantastic way to bring the outdoors in. Not only does greenery help wake up the mantel with lively organic color, it also adds some unique texture that can be hard to achieve with other decorative objects.\n[ Image Credit ]\nContinue to 5 of 7 below. 05 of 07 Add Height to Your Mantel We Heart It When styling your mantel, be sure to add objects that draw the eye upwards. Items like mirrors, art, sculptures, and photography that can be blown up to really large sizes are all great options. Without some sort of vertical visual, the space above your mantel can seem empty, making it hard for your mantel to compete with the interest of the fireplace below.\n[ Image Credit ]\nContinue to 6 of 7 below. 06 of 07 Use Contrasting Colors DustJacket Nothing makes a statement like using bold and contrasting colors when decorating your mantel. Decorating with flowers and ceramics are a great way to add a pop of color to the area. Try pairing soft, neutral colors like pinks, creams, grays, and whites, with bold blues, emerald greens, and cherry reds.\n[ Image Credit ]\nContinue to 7 of 7 below. 07 of 07 Keep Objects to the Side Renaissance London As exciting as it can be to load up the mantel with great pieces, you don\u2019t need to cover your entire mantel with objects for it to look styled and complete. In fact, try adding a few objects on just the left and right sides of the mantel. With this kind of selective styling, you\u2019re able to create a beautiful and more dramatic focal point.\n[ Image Credit ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://allthekingshouses.tumblr.com/post/30482485417", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/AaBvmLHn7zEPulFu6AnXAyArQ1c=/735x0/mantel-styling-tips-05-56a52a923df78cf77286a2f3.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/LfUMsEzpuo-rEft4HQWCcUxhFGk=/735x0/mantel-styling-tips-04-56a52a923df78cf77286a2f0.jpg", "http://www.renaissancelondon.com/recent-work", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/-QHF1NRXrTC6OzYVw2KiboDKp2g=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/mantel-styling-tips-07-56a52a935f9b58b7d0db35b2.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/KndfCp8s6L26bu3hFfd0yh6FxJk=/735x0/mantel-styling-tips-02-56a52a915f9b58b7d0db35ac.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/1GgB6v5NQBaA1KaUJDmIzRjHhlE=/735x0/mantel-styling-tips-56a52a905f9b58b7d0db35a9.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/OmhsC10zErUysnAf5mLhriIQPcY=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/mantel-styling-tips-02-56a52a915f9b58b7d0db35ac.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/yUaHN9KF7q-9WkkeOqv9UbEG9Wo=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/mantel-styling-tips-01-56a52a903df78cf77286a2ed.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/X1gCj0thKKYiuZhRiPQPfr9K57g=/735x0/mantel-styling-tips-03-56a52a915f9b58b7d0db35af.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/_PPQ-lBWNBNjhF2228fee94ggJY=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/mantel-styling-tips-56a52a905f9b58b7d0db35a9.jpg", "http://dustjacket-attic.com/2015/03/interiors-entrecote-parisian-style.html/", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/4043eR76aF8NGdzfcUBHCWa4qOQ=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/mantel-styling-tips-05-56a52a923df78cf77286a2f3.jpg", "http://weheartit.com/entry/4260252", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/a3Lsxm1bQELJJf3_HelhJ0Otb6Y=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/mantel-styling-tips-03-56a52a915f9b58b7d0db35af.jpg", "http://www.sfgirlbybay.com/2014/01/28/at-home-in-silverlake/", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/3c0x6PYW9_mDL3Gy41jLwXsFDjc=/735x0/mantel-styling-tips-07-56a52a935f9b58b7d0db35b2.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/58vzMAhEncGQ9sAB4OTU7BYo5vc=/735x0/mantel-styling-tips-01-56a52a903df78cf77286a2ed.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/yCvwVGAhW4BoXzMUDaM2m26p91E=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/mantel-styling-tips-04-56a52a923df78cf77286a2f0.jpg", "http://www.ladolcevitablog.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:57:15.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42509af7dd15cbcd80722c93bed995d8c05e292f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3Jy3doh0pbomIN8LBD.oBuaEVeEshpmchIT8253hnctvjKUdxqvdFZEqlFdFrhL6tu", "site_full": "www.thespruce.com", "site": "thespruce.com", "site_section": "https://www.thespruce.com/indoor-activities-for-kids-4127632", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Indoor Activities for Kids", "title": "Winter Activities for Kids Looking to Beat Cabin Fever", "title_full": "Winter Activities for Kids Looking to Beat Cabin Fever", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.267, "main_image": "https://fthmb.tqn.com/CCWRGQaxmvGSv9v3Ar2M5_w4STc=/2250x1500/filters:fill(auto,1)/winter-fun-for-kids-5779503f5f9b585875a23060.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "42509af7dd15cbcd80722c93bed995d8c05e292f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3Jy3doh0pbomIN8LBD.oBuaEVeEshpmchIT8253hnctvjKUdxqvdFZEqlFdFrhL6tu", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Apryl Duncan", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Winter Activities for Kids Looking to Beat Cabin Fever", "text": "Families tend to hibernate when the temperatures get colder, but there's plenty of winter fun for children and parents to enjoy together. You'll forget all about the winter blahs with these winter activities for kids looking to beat those cabin fever blues.\n01 of 12 Play Snow Games Snow games are always fun winter activities for kids. Photo \u00a9 ImagesBazaar / Getty Images You don't have to tell kids to go outside and play in the snow. Try shaking up their snowsuits with winter activities that include a snowy hike, outdoor hockey or a frosty game of frisbee. No white stuff where you live? Make fake snow so your kids can experience the same winter fun as their northern neighbors.\n02 of 12 Trace Your Family Tree Photo \u00a9 Image Source / Getty Images Help the kids learn about their family roots . They can interview you, their grandparents and other family members to hear the names and stories of people who've helped make them who they are today. Filling in the names on the family tree branches can keep their interest long after snowmen have melted and winter is gone.\n03 of 12 Watch a Family Movie at Home Turn your living room into a movie theater, complete with tickets, a concession stand and movie reviews. Photo \u00a9 Maskot / Getty Images One of your family's favorite winter activities is watching movies. But why spend a small fortune taking the families to the movies when you can stay at home for an even better theater experience? Host an unforgettable family movie night that's more than a couple of hours sitting on the couch together. Let the kids create movie tickets, make snacks and open their own concession stand. After the movie's over, let their inner critics write movie reviews.\n04 of 12 Start Scrapbooking Photo \u00a9 Hero Images / Getty Images We all love our digital cameras. But then our pictures usually sit on a hard drive and aren't viewed as much as the pictures we once took with our film cameras. Print your favorite pics and start scrapbooking with your kids. Theme your scrapbook pages for the winter and holidays with layout ideas and tips from other scrapbookers .\nContinue to 5 of 12 below. 05 of 12 Go Skating Photo \u00a9 Simone Ramella / Flickr Today's kids are plugged into their online social networks and their video games. Take them back to your own childhood when a Saturday night meant a trip to the skating rink. Roller skate or inline skate with your family or stay in that wintry mood with ice skating.\n06 of 12 Create a Website With Your Kids Photo \u00a9 Nancy Ney / Getty Images It's cold outside, so stay warm with the kids in front of the computer. Create a website together , even if you have no web design skills. You both can learn as you build a website that covers the life of their dog, a tribute to a favorite child star or a sampling of her short stories, to name a few of the possibilities. Learning how to maintain her own website is just one of many learning activities that are fun .\n07 of 12 Redecorate the Kids' Rooms Photo \u00a9 Hero Images / Getty Images Kids spend a lot of time within their four bedroom walls during the winter. Since you're stuck inside, re-energize their rooms by making redecorating one of your winter activities. Work closely with them to choose colors, themes and accessories to give their bedrooms a new look. As much as you may not want that fluorescent green color on the wall, try to relax some of your rules to give them ownership of the project.\n08 of 12 Cook Together Photo \u00a9 Yagi Studio / Getty Images We often unpack the cookie cutters around the holidays, but get the kids more involved in the kitchen. The youngest chefs-in-training can gather ingredients, help stir and clean up. Prepare crockpot soups and other winter recipes together to help your kids learn more about their food, nutrition values and healthy eating.\nContinue to 9 of 12 below. 09 of 12 Donate to a Charity Photo \u00a9 Images by Tang Ming Tung / Getty Images Get into the holiday spirit while teaching your kids how to be thankful. With so many charitable organizations relying on donations around the holidays, your kids can buy toys for less fortunate children or even pack up a shoe box of items with a personal note to send to children overseas. Pick any charity you feel is worthy or specifically look for holiday-related charity projects .\n10 of 12 Volunteer Your Family's Time Photo \u00a9 Brand X Pictures / Getty Images Let the kids volunteer during the winter. There are plenty of kid-friendly charity events where your family's help would be greatly appreciated. Serve food to the homeless for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Visit the elderly at a nursing home or hospital. Help your local animal shelter during an adopt-a-thon. Look over volunteer websites that match you and your family to the right opportunity based on your interests. Exposing your children to volunteering can open the door for a lifetime of ... MORE service to others.\n11 of 12 Make Your Own Wrapping Paper Photo \u00a9 Fotokia / Getty Images As children get ready to swap gifts with their friends, skip the high-priced wrapping paper at the store. Make your own wrapping paper with rubber stamps, and let the kids personalize it with their crayons, markers or stickers. Use the same ideas to create more handmade packages , such as gift boxes and gift bags.\n12 of 12 Build Model Cars or a Dollhouse Photo \u00a9 Sierra Tierra / Flickr Enjoy one-on-one time with your kids when you take on classic hobbies as a winter activity. Building die cast cars and dollhouses keeps you busy on those cold winter days and requires you and your children to work together as a team to complete the project.\nIf you're not sure you can handle these types of projects on your own at first, take the kids to a Lowe's Build and Grow workshop or a Home Depot Kids workshop. These workshops encourage kids to build everything from bug houses to ...

What lies before you is your standard-issue hideous bedroom:\nMousy carpet. Ceiling light fixture more appropriate for an interrogation room. An unwelcoming bed. Horrible bedroom paint more appropriate for a child's room, circa 1985. Come to think of it, this bedroom isn't so much nasty as it is devoid of anything.

Basically, contemporary style means the looks that are currently in vogue. As such, contemporary bedroom d\u00e9cor covers a wide range of themes, but what they all tend to share in common is a serene, clutter-free vibe and a simple color scheme.\nCase in point \u2013 the bedroom shown here. There\u2019s not a lot of furniture or knickknacks in this room, but there is certainly no lack of personality. This is how you make a contemporary ...

Here, that\u2019s accomplished with the mirrored finishes on the nightstands, the lovely flowering branches stenciled across the sliding closet doors and the crystal drops hanging from the otherwise plain hanging light fixtures.\nContinue to 2 of 10 below. 02 of 10 Contemporary Goes Glamorous The International Photo Co./Getty Images Contemporary is not synonymous with stark. As proof, take a look at the bedroom featured here. The charcoal and taupe color scheme is very of-the-moment, but there is nothing minimalistic about this glamorous bedroom. Instead, the wraparound upholstered headboard, cable knit throw blanket and textured pillows turn the bed into a romantic showstopper, while the clear Plexiglass-and-chrome nightstands, the interesting ceiling fixture and the burnished metal bedside lamps keep the style ...

The bedroom featured here makes excellent use of a wide range of textures -- the fur throw blanket, highly polished concrete floor, shaggy area rug, wicker furniture and shiny metal wall sconces turn what might have been a rather sterile space into an inviting room ...

Notice also the way the area rug is used to set off the seating area \u2013 if you have a large bedroom, this is a great use of the space.\nContinue to 4 of 10 below. 04 of 10 Contemporary Has Fun Robert Daly/Getty Images The white and soft brown color scheme give this bedroom a peaceful vibe, but it\u2019s the quirky little touches that show off the owner\u2019s sense of whimsy. What a great way to dress up the wall \u2013 long, thin branches painted white, then arranged side-by-side across nearly the entire space. It\u2019s an easy, inexpensive DIY that gives drama without being at all overbearing. The pompoms on the throw blanket tossed over the chair, the colorful fringe on the blanket at the foot of the bed and the mix of ...

This very appealing bedroom, that\u2019s what. The white ceiling beams, gray wall and lack of artwork might be somewhat stark, but the graceful-yet-simple four-poster bed, the stacked-ball bedside lamps and the splashes of red on the throw pillows add a touch of almost old-fashioned romantic grace to this very contemporary bedroom.\nContinue to 6 of 10 below. 06 of 10 Contemporary's Rustic Side Leanna Rathkelly/Getty Images You might not be so lucky as to have a glorious view of the ocean outside your bedroom like the room featured here, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make use of its other decorating tricks. This bedroom shows off contemporary\u2019s primitive side . The palette is heavy on black and gray, which usually goes with a sleekly modern style, but instead, this bedroom mixes up the expected with the distressed wood furniture and beamed ceiling, soft yellow accents and geometric-print bedding. Here\u2019s proof that ...

But contemporary doesn\u2019t have to mean without any color or whimsy.

Just a few simple accents, and the room transforms from ho-hum into wow.\nContinue to 8 of 10 below. 08 of 10 Natural Wood Finishes gerenme/Getty Images Here\u2019s a bedroom that goes contemporary with the black-and-white color scheme, but stays traditional with the natural brown furniture. You\u2019ll often find painted or lacquered furniture in the contemporary style, but sticking with natural wood keeps the look warm and welcoming.\nContinue to 9 of 10 below. 09 of 10 Serenity Now Martin Barraud/Getty Images For most people, the bedroom is their retreat from the rigors of the day.

country right. Photo courtesy of Coastal Living If the words \u201ccountry decorating style\u201d fill your mind with visions of a 1980s-era explosion of dusty blue and mauve ruffles along with be-ribboned geese, it\u2019s time to get up to date. There\u2019s a reason the country style is a decorating classic: it\u2019s extremely versatile, it\u2019s casual and welcoming, it\u2019s easy to adapt to any budget and \u2013 with today\u2019s updates \u2013 it is relaxing and peaceful: just the vibe you want in your bedroom.\nOne of the beauties of the country style is how many sub-styles fall ... MORE under its large umbrella: French country, farmhouse, cottage, rustic, Southwestern, English country, Americana and shabby chic all share the easy, friendly, and most of all, casual country charm. Like all decorating styles, country rises and falls in popularity , and modifies and updates to incorporate contemporary decorating aesthetics. Today\u2019s country is a far cry from the overly fussy, feminine and ruffled looks of yesteryear. So if it\u2019s been awhile since you considered this once-again-riding-high decorating classic, take a look at the eight bedrooms featured here. Each shows off a different face of today\u2019s take on country style.\nContinue to 2 of 9 below. 02 of 09 French Country Warm and welcoming, the French country style. Photo courtesy of Better Homes and Gardens Yesterday\u2019s French country style was a riot of sunflowers, grapes and wine motifs, roosters and bold color. Today, you\u2019ll still find the traditional warm palette, but it\u2019s softer. Cheery yellow, sage green and terracotta are still hallmarks of the look, but in softer tints, and against a backdrop of creamy white, whispery peach or palest tan, rather than the darker mustards or oranges popular in past versions of this style. One thing that hasn\u2019t changed: toile is a must-have in the French ... MORE country room. Mix it with florals, checks or stripes , but keep the palette limited to just a few colors with the same intensity for today\u2019s take on French country.\nContinue to 3 of 9 below. 03 of 09 English Country Colorful and calming, the English country bedroom. Photo courtesy of Country Home Magazine You might wonder what the difference is between English country and French country. The answer is, not a lot. But in general, French country\u2019s palette is warmer and brighter; English country furniture is sturdy and rustic while French country favors rounded shapes and a more refined appearance; French country leans towards toile, checks and gentle scenes of outdoor life while English country loves florals, dogs and horses, and a mix of patterns .\nBut there\u2019s nothing fussy or overly traditional ... MORE about today\u2019s English country d\u00e9cor. Instead, it\u2019s whimsical, colorful and oh-so-comfortable.\nContinue to 4 of 9 below. 04 of 09 Cottage Today's cottage bedroom is sweet but not saccharine. Photo courtesy of HGTV It\u2019s hard to beat the cozy charm of a cottage bedroom . This classic look always features plenty of mixed patterns \u2013 particularly floral prints \u2013 along with distressed furniture, pastels, lots of throw pillows, and a bed made extra-comfy with thick quilts or blankets. What you won\u2019t find in today\u2019s cottage bedroom, however, is an overabundance of cutesy ruffles and flowers or an excess of knickknacks (although the cottage vibe never approaches minimalism). And today, a few shots of bright color ... MORE are likely to liven up the otherwise tranquil palette.\nContinue to 5 of 9 below. 05 of 09 Southwestern Southwestern style gets a contemporary makeover. Photo courtesy of Domestic Imperfection Yesterday\u2019s Southwestern d\u00e9cor was heavy, super-rugged and filled with dark wood and intense color, especially red, terracotta and black. Today, the style is reinvigorated with softer hues, trimmed-down furniture and an overall simpler feel. What you\u2019ll still find, however, are Navajo prints on rugs, bedding or window treatments, along with rustic touches and animal motifs, particularly wolves or bison. The gorgeous Southwestern bedroom shown here was designed by Domestic Imperfection .\nContinue to 6 of 9 below. 06 of 09 Americana Red, white and blue is just right. Photo courtesy of Talk of the House You can\u2019t go wrong with the good old red, white and blue , but that doesn\u2019t mean your Americana-themed bedroom has to look like a float in the Fourth of July parade. Instead of yesterday\u2019s emphasis on flags, Uncle Sam, and an overwhelming palette, todays\u2019 look uses red, white and blue as cheery accents against a neutral backdrop. Checks, gingham, stripes and stars are must-have patterns in this style, which although far more sophisticated than in the past, hasn\u2019t lost a bit of its casual charm. ... MORE This adorable Americana bedroom is from Talk of the House.\nContinue to 7 of 9 below. 07 of 09 Shabby Chic Shabby chic is back, and this time, it's better. Photo courtesy of Wow Decor A hallmark of the 1990s, shabby chic took vintage, feminine style to an extreme. White rooms filled with an explosion of ruffles, light fixtures dripping crystal pendants, peeling paint and pale floral prints were everywhere, until overload set in and decorators started turning to more minimalist styles. But shabby chic is back. Today, however, you\u2019ll find far less ruffles and crystal. Instead, there\u2019s a bit more color, a bit less pattern, and a lot less fuss and clutter. What you\u2019ll still find ... MORE is distressed furniture, lots of vintage or repurposed items and pretty floral prints.\nContinue to 8 of 9 below. 08 of 09 Rustic Sophisticated rustic style is just right in the bedroom. Photo courtesy of DigsDigs Yesterday\u2019s rustic style was heavy on the log-cabin vibe, complete with lodge details, bear and moose motifs and dark colors. Today, the rustic style is more sophisticated. Mix aged wooden pieces with contemporary lighting and accessories, keep the palette soft and neutral, pile the bed high with luxurious bedding, and you have a room that soothes and pampers, yet is loaded with personality. Add further interest with twig d\u00e9cor or a faux fur area rug or throw blanket. It\u2019s a far cry from ... MORE sleeping in a primitive cabin.\nContinue to 9 of 9 below. 09 of 09 Modern Farmhouse The modern farmhouse bedroom is soothing but never stark. Photo courtesy of Houzz There\u2019s nothing utilitarian or stark about the modern farmhouse look, but it\u2019s not cutesy or colorful, either. The style embraces yesterday\u2019s rustic beauty, casual comfort and emphasis on simplicity, but adds today\u2019s love of sleek touches of metal, interesting accessories and modern conveniences.

But don\u2019t discount the power of stripes in the master bedroom as well \u2013 just keep them on either the walls or the ceiling, not both.

But, like most decorations or toys from another era, these plastic angels and snowmen are nostalgic and have joined the ranks of silver aluminum Christmas trees and color wheels in becoming vintage chic and collectible. Most of the holiday blow mold manufacturers have closed up shop or stopped production. Only a few, like General Foam, have not thrown out the molds and continue to manufacture the plastic decorations.\nSome holiday decorators inherit blow molds from their parents or grandparents, while others have sparked their collection by picking up one or two at yard sales or flea markets .

I still find it delightful when people do this\u2014the people who mix Santa and the reindeer with nativity scenes, carolers and snowmen...things that shouldn't really even go together but for some reason they do go together when they fill the night air with that blow mold glow.\"\nContinue to 12 of 15 below. 12 of 15 Florida Blow Mold Scene A blow mold nativity and star in sunny Florida.

Freeman The blow mold cast of the Freeman family's front yard Christmas display peer out from a massive snowstorm that was part of the North American December 2010 blizzard on December 25-27.

If you haven't broken out the pumpkin in your kitchen yet, now is the time, and the best place to start is with these easy pumpkin snickerdoodles.\nFlavored with real pumpkin puree and pumpkin spice, this is a cozy twist on a classic snickerdoodle . It has the classic crackle-topped cinnamon and sugar surface that gives way to a soft, melt in your mouth interior, and it is a must-bake this season.\nThis recipe uses canned pumpkin, but just make sure not to confuse it with pumpkin pie filling, which is usually sold right beside the pumpkin puree. Pumpkin pie filling tends to have lots of add-ins that you don't need, nor want, for this recipe. So, just make sure when you are picking up your pumpkin puree that the label reads \"100% pure pumpkin\" and get ready to enjoy at your next Fall celebration!\nWhat You'll Need For Dough: 1 stick unsalted butter (softened) 1/2 cup sugar (white) 1/3 cup light brown sugar (tightly packed) 1/4 cup pumpkin puree (should be 100% pumpkin, NOT \"pumpkin pie filling\") 1 egg yolk 3/4 tsp. vanilla extract 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour 3/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice 1/2 tsp. baking soda 1/4 tsp. cream of tartar 1/4 tsp. salt For Rolling: 1/4 cup sugar 2 tsp. ground cinnamon How to Make It Using an electric mixer, or stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream together butter, sugar, and brown sugar until well-combined. Add pumpkin puree, stir until combined. Add egg yolk and vanilla extract and stir together. In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk together all purpose flour, pumpkin spice, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt until well-combined. Gradually add dry ingredients to wet ingredients with mixer on low speed until ingredients are well-combined. Be sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are well incorporated. Cover cookie dough with clear wrap and place in refrigerator to chill for 45 minutes. One dough is nearly finished chilling, preheat oven to 375F and prepare a cookie sheet by lining with parchment paper. Prepare your cinnamon sugar mixture by whisking together 1/4 cup sugar and 2 tsp ground cinnamon in a small bowl. Remove dough from refrigerator and create 16 (1 1/2 Tbsp-sized) balls. Roll through cinnamon sugar and transfer to prepared cookie sheet, spacing at least 2\" apart. Bake cookies in a 375F oven for 10-12 minutes. Keep your remaining dough refrigerated while cookies are baking and do not place cookie dough on a hot baking sheet.

much as you. Image Copr. GK Hart/Vikki Hart/The Image BankGetty Images Carbon monoxide poison is an odorless, colorless, tasteless gas. It\u2019s a natural by-product of fuel combustion present in car exhaust and improperly vented furnaces, space heaters, water heaters, fireplaces, and tobacco smoke. It can quickly kill people as well as their pets.\nPet owners are very aware of the heat stroke dangers of leaving puppies in hot cars during the summer. But cars in cold weather can also pose dangers beyond that of frostbite or hypothermia.\nChildren and pets have died in as little as 15 minutes from carbon monoxide inside running cars while parents shoveled snow outside the vehicle, unaware the tailpipe was blocked. Running the car in a closed garage poses the same danger.\nThe gas causes the same symptoms in puppies and other pets as in their owners. However, carbon monoxide is lighter than air, so pups that live at or below human knee level may not show symptoms as quickly as their owners. Small puppies or dogs, though, that are carried around such as in an owner\u2019s purse and especially those exposed to second-hand smoke could be stricken as quickly as their taller owners. Birds are particularly susceptible and often show signs first.\nSymptoms of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning The most common symptom of human carbon monoxide poisoning (low doses) in otherwise healthy people is fatigue. That clears up when you leave the house. In heart patients, it can cause chest \u200bpains.\nHigher concentrations cause a headache, confusion, and disorientation, and flu-like symptoms with vomiting. Ultimately, the poison victim falls into a coma. When the victim is asleep during exposure to the poison, the dog, cat, bird or the person may never wake up.\nWe don't know if poisoned pets suffer headaches because they can\u2019t tell us about this early sign.\nBut they do act confused, lethargic, and drunk in the same way as human victims. If your normally high-energy puppy doesn\u2019t want to play but acts rejuvenated once outside for a while, that could indicate a potential problem. A distinctive sign common to both people and pets is bright cherry-red gums in the mouth.\nHow Carbon Monoxide Poisons Pets Here\u2019s what happens. Carbon monoxide is inhaled, absorbed through the lungs into the bloodstream. There it binds with hemoglobin, the oxygen-transporting component of blood. This blocks the hemoglobin from using or carrying oxygen at all, which affects all areas of the body including the brain. The gas creates a kind of chemical suffocation.\nThe body can only get rid of the poison bound to the hemoglobin by breathing it out, or by replacing the poisoned hemoglobin with new. The liver and spleen replace hemoglobin about every ten to fifteen days. When only a small amount of the blood is affected, the victim recovers without treatment as long as no more poison is inhaled.\nBut high levels of blood saturation will kill the person or pet unless emergency treatment is given. Twenty-five percent saturation level is considered dangerous for people. Usually, though, both people and pets should be treated when the carbon monoxide saturation level is ten percent or higher.\nPuppies are so much smaller, they can be affected more severely by the poison. Smokers will be more susceptible because they already have an elevated level of carbon monoxide in their bloodstream. In other words, if one family member smokes, he or she may suffer symptoms sooner than other non-smoking family members.\nTreatment for Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Poison victims are treated with high concentrations of oxygen. That increases the amount of gas that is breathed out. Many hours of oxygen therapy may be required. In some cases, ventilation may be necessary.\nTo protect yourself and your puppies from carbon monoxide poisoning, get your heating units inspected every year before you start using them. Carbon monoxide detectors are also available to be installed as a warning system.\nIf you notice any change in your pet's behavior or your own health that coincides with cold weather or the furnace coming on, don\u2019t automatically assume it\u2019s the flu.\nConsult with medical specialists for both your pets and for yourself.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://fthmb.tqn.com/KAhkUauwCCmkgpAEOAb3ECi2DM4=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/Golden-Pray-Bed-Resize-56a7a3c03df78cf77297cc9b.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/MqvOxQVs9orAinpSjDurcDT9-y4=/735x0/Golden-Pray-Bed-Resize-56a7a3c03df78cf77297cc9b.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ima", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ge copr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:13:54.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5b1d1c16c2282f0772e7000c00594b0bced066ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3J4Jva7B0apbzSDwMCnOo9tit_FMZh6mYENqi27PvFK6lMaI7EjR.aOA--", "site_full": "www.thespruce.com", "site": "thespruce.com", "site_section": "https://www.thespruce.com/home-tours-and-staging-4127938", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Home Tours &amp; Staging", "title": "How to Choose the Best Exterior House Colors", "title_full": "How to Choose the Best Exterior House Colors", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.997, "main_image": "https://fthmb.tqn.com/YypDz-gy6qx2bPk9-IgtHiaKmHA=/1500x997/filters:fill(auto,1)/choosinghomeexteriorbestcolors-56e0148e5f9b5854a9f6d1ba.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5b1d1c16c2282f0772e7000c00594b0bced066ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3J4Jva7B0apbzSDwMCnOo9tit_FMZh6mYENqi27PvFK6lMaI7EjR.aOA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ronique Gibson", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Choose the Best Exterior House Colors", "text": "01 of 03 Use your Home's Architectural Details as Color Guides Use your home's architectural details for color guidance.

Have You Gotten the Memo Yet? CC-Licensed; Flickr User Urbane Apartments Kitchen track lighting is no longer stuck in the Dark Ages. Time was, if you wanted to install it in your kitchen, you were relegated to the world of bulky tracks and ugly light fixtures. Imagine the kind of lighting you'd find in a Wendy's or McDonald's and you get the picture.\nBut around 2000, lighting manufacturers began stepping up their game. Sleek, curving tracks emerged on the market, with high-intensity halogens that really did manage to illuminate kitchen work areas.\nBefore we look at a ... MORE few representative products, let's review some of the key points of track lighting for your kitchen:\nFlexible : Where track lighting really excels is in flexibility. Tracks can be mounted virtually anywhere you need light. Energy-Saving : Track lighting can actually be an energy saver. How? You only need to install as many lights on the tracks as you need. Also, tracks can be wired independently, so that one track can be left off or dimmed, while another one picks up the lighting duties. Choose Kit or Pack : Unless you specify \"kit\" or \"pack\" when looking for track lighting, you won't get all the components you need to install it. Can Go On Drywall : Tracks are generally not so heavy that they need to be screwed into joists (wood). They can be mounted on a hollow surface with molly bolts. Beware Of Your Power Draw : You'll need to be aware of your power draw when adding lights to the tracks. The tracks are not infinitely scalable. Carefully read product instructions to see how many lights you can add. Halogens? Factor the cost of expensive halogen bulbs into your purchase. They can often rival the cost of the track lighting kit itself.

Getty / Harri Tahvanainen If painting a house's exterior is a dreaded activity, then removing paint during the prep stage is an even more dreaded activity.\nThe first thing you should know is that there is no single tool that will remove house paint in every instance and form. Rather, you need to think of yourself as a warrior fighting a battle against bad, peeling, alligatored, loose, and otherwise insubstantial existing paint--that is, paint will not provide a solid base for the next layer of paint.\nEven with that said, ... MORE tool manufacturers and solvent companies for ages have been promoting the \"miracle paint stripper\" for all of your house paint problems. Ahhh...if only it were that easy.\nSo, we present to you a series of tools and solvents that you can use at your option to remove exterior house paint during the prep stage of your next painting project.\nContinue to 2 of 6 below. 02 of 06 The Paint Shaver Copyright American Int'l Tool Industries What Is It? :\nLots of tools claim to shave paint, but there is one brand-name tool called The Paint Shaver that does just that--and well. It's a tool used by pro painters to remove paint with relative ease. A vacuum sucks away stripped debris and collects it for later disposal.\nHow Effective? (1-10) :\n9\nWhat You Won't Like: :\nThe Paint Shaver is ultra-expensive, starting at $600 (July 2011). It's bulky, too.\nWhat You Will Like: :\nIt's the tool-to-end-all-tools for removing paint from your house exterior.\nContinue to 3 of 6 below. 03 of 06 Will a Heat Gun \"Melt Away\" Your Paint Removal Problems? Copyright WENS, via Sears What Is It? :\nAn electric gun or scraper pulling 1,000 watts or more to soften paint for easier scraping. How Effective? (1-10) :\n8\nWhat You Won't Like: :\nHeat guns and scrapers are slooow--but they do work. Also, if you are squeamish about matters such as potentially burning down your house, you may want to stay away from heated implements. While this probably will not happen, it's never a good thing to combine high temperatures with dry wood.\nWhat You Will Like: :\nYou can also use heat guns for other ... MORE purposes, such as gently thawing frozen pipes.\nContinue to 4 of 6 below. 04 of 06 Manually (and Cheaply) Remove Paint From House with Scraper Lee Wallender What Is It? :\nA manual paint scraper, probably the oldest and most reliable way to scrape paint . It helps to use a neat little implement called an 8-In-1 Painter's Tool. Compare Prices - Paint Scrapers\nHow Effective? (1-10) :\n7\nWhat You Won't Like: :\nIt takes a lot of muscle-work to scrape paint with a manual scraper.\nWhat You Will Like: :\nWith a manual scraper you have plenty of control--little chance of gouging the material underneath.\nContinue to 5 of 6 below. 05 of 06 Wire Brush Lee Wallender What Is It? :\nA brush with tines made of wire. How Effective? (1-10) :\n3\nWhat You Won't Like: :\nIt only scrapes off loose, peeling paint. A wire brush is more for tidying up an area of peeling paint than for scraping off paint.\nWhat You Will Like: :\nWire brushes are cheap and quick to put into action (as opposed to something like a sander, which needs some set-up time).\nContinue to 6 of 6 below. 06 of 06 Using Electric Sander to Remove House Paint Lee Wallender What Is It? :\nElectric sander, either corded or cordless. How Effective? (1-10) :\n5\nWhat You Won't Like: :\nLike the wire brush, the electric sander isn't really a paint scraper. It really excels at ripping and smoothing away loose edges of paint.

Sure, get some chicks, raise them to slaughtering size, process them or get them processed, and sell them, right? Sounds easy. But organizing your chicken broiler business takes some work. Follow these steps and you'll be off and running - and making money selling delicious, fresh pastured chicken - very soon.\nKnow the Laws You should begin by investigating your state and local laws around poultry sales. This is going to feed into the next two steps, where you will determine your market and write a business plan .\nWhat do we mean by the laws? Many states require that meat chickens be processed in a USDA-approved facility in order to be legally sold to the public. However, in some states, if your poultry operation is small enough in scale, you can sell whole chickens directly to restaurants. And you may be allowed to sell whole chickens to the public as long as you sell them \u200bdirectly from your farm.\nResearch the laws that apply to you, because knowing where you'll get the chickens processed and how much that will cost will affect your business plan.\nLearn How to Raise Chickens for Meat If you don't already know, research research research. How will you raise your chickens? On pasture or confined? Learn how to keep baby chicks healthy and raise them to market size without losing too many to illness or predators.\nKnow Your Market Figuring out your market is the next step for your new chicken business. Who are your local buyers? Will you sell to consumers directly from your farm (and if so, how will they know where to find you)? Will you sell to restaurants?\nAlso consider whether you will sell conventional Cornish Rocks, the fast-growing cross that is the large-scale poultry industry standard, or go for an heirloom breed or hybrid specially designed to forage on pasture, like Freedom Rangers .\nYour market will determine this; are you selling to people who know the difference and care? Birds raised on pasture may take longer to reach market weight, ultimately costing you more money. Will the market support the price per pound you'll need to charge to be profitable?\nWrite a Business Plan Identifying your market is part of your business plan, but you'll need more information than just that to create a guide for your business as you move along toward its creation.\nAnother part of the business plan is making specific, measurable goals. How many broilers will you raise for your first run? What is the market size? What equipment will you need for them: fencing, housing, waterers, and feeders?\nAlso, make sure to consider capital. Specifically, how much of it do you have? You'll need to factor in any equipment costs such as the construction of a coop. Another cost is the chicks themselves. And you'll need to pay for all the feed they will gobble up at an alarming rate until they reach market size. You may need medications or supplements as well.\nRaise Your Chicks Once you have your chicks, you can get underway. Baby chicks need some special care - the temperature must be kept constantly warm, just like if their mother hen was there to keep them warm.\nAnd you'll need to prevent early problems like pasting up and monitor for illnesses such as coccidiosis.\nProcess the Birds Depending on the laws, your markets, and your comfort level, you may decide to slaughter and process the chickens on the farm. I've done it both ways: myself and taking them to a slaughterhouse. While the slaughterhouse is far easier, it's also incredibly expensive and adds a lot to the cost of each bird.\nThere are also mobile slaughterhouses in some areas - a trailer or \"mobile poultry processing unit\" comes to your farm and processes the birds on-farm for you. Some of these have a minimum number of birds, so be sure to consider that when making your business plan.\nSell the Chickens Your birds are processed, packaged, and in the freezer - so now it's time to put that marketing plan into action and sell them.\nWhether you're bringing them to the farmers market , selling to restaurants, or direct to consumers, you'll need to refer back to your business plan to sell the chickens you've so carefully raised.\nReassess and Reevaluate Like with any business, you should regularly reassess and reevaluate to see if things are still working. Did your marketing plan work or does it need to be retooled? Do you want to raise more birds next time or fewer? Did you find on-farm processing to work well, or will you hire out that job next time?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://fthmb.tqn.com/zVSFeRCjf4FoGkE_lkQ4sKNZ3mY=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/Chickens-poultry-farm-GettyImages-172865885-58b6ffe75f9b58604670f80c.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/qtULITC7I6EfUyZ7Vneg4ZJiYZU=/735x0/Chickens-poultry-farm-GettyImages-172865885-58b6ffe75f9b58604670f80c.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "small farm sansubba / getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freedom rangers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cornish rocks", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:46:41.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2f1b7732fd03e3b0bc8fb900195ad569a03bab39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3Jl5nHedWlYYZWOciZMakX8mo_hyAJAgT54B7a_tGZCJy8cteYXEtpgSa0ESqrQIIDYgoshQAbvhs-", "site_full": "www.thespruce.com", "site": "thespruce.com", "site_section": "https://www.thespruce.com/plumbing-4127792", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Plumbing Repair", "title": "Starting a Sprinkler System after Winterizing", "title_full": "Starting a Sprinkler System after Winterizing", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fthmb.tqn.com/outyuBKRB5Dqm-HJ1CBl65JnixA=/4288x2848/filters:fill(auto,1)/lawn-sprinklers-155158227-5796a6865f9b58461f54fe80.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2f1b7732fd03e3b0bc8fb900195ad569a03bab39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3Jl5nHedWlYYZWOciZMakX8mo_hyAJAgT54B7a_tGZCJy8cteYXEtpgSa0ESqrQIIDYgoshQAbvhs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aaron Stickley", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Starting a Sprinkler System after Winterizing", "text": "Todd Arbini / Getty Images To start a sprinkler system after winterizing you must first know where the sprinkler system shut offs are. If you had an irrigation service company shut down, blow out, and drain the system sometimes it is easier just to call them back to turn it on. Many lawn service companies will even shut your sprinkler down for the winter and start it back up when the time comes. If you can find the main sprinkler shut off valve and have a key to turn it back on then you can turn it on yourself.\nMost of the time the shut off valve for the sprinkler line is in a long irrigation tube near the sprinkler control boxes.\nThe most important thing when turning on a sprinkler system is to turn the water on slowly. You can cause a huge water hammer by turning the water on too quickly and this can burst fittings or pop off sprinkler heads. No matter which valve you are turning on make sure you open it slowly and give it time to pressurize before opening it all the way. The following steps will guide you through the process to start a sprinkler system after winterizing.\nTo turn a sprinkler system on located the sprinkler shut off valves. In my area, there are stop and waste valves in the ground and then pressure vacuum breakers above ground. Both of which are usually off and can shut off the sprinkler system. Turn on the valves. The stop and waste valve in the ground requires a long meter key to reach it. Most stop and waste valves turn 90 degrees in a counter-clockwise direction to turn them on. This type of valve will sometimes leak a little when first turned on but it should be only for a short time. Keep an eye on it and make sure the valve is not continually running. Pressure vacuum breakers are usually turned on with two ball valves that are located on either side of the vacuum breaker valve. The ball valve in the parallel position means it is on while the perpendicular positions mean it is off. A quarter turn is all that is needed to turn on a ball valve. Make sure it is turned on as slowly as possible.Time to check the individual sprinkler valves.\nIt is a good idea to remove the sprinkler head at the end of each line before turning on the sprinkler valves. This way if anything is in the line it will get flushed out and it will also protect against any water hammer in case you turn the valve on too fast. By this time you will have water to the pressure side of the valve and you can turn the sprinklers valves on one by one to see if there are any leaks in the sprinkler lines themselves. Sprinklers can be turned on at the timer or by using the manual screw that most sprinkler valves have on the side. But you can turn the system on slower if you do it manually at the individual sprinkler valves.\nTake your time and go through each of the sprinkler stations because if a line is broken underground it may take some time to bubble up. Dig up and repair any leaks and replace sprinkler heads that are broken. Make any necessary adjustments to the spray pattern of the sprinkler heads. Let it run a bit and check the coverage. Some spray heads may have to be cleaned out or adjusted before working properly again. Set the timer. It\u2019s a good idea to set the watering times when you can keep an eye on the watering especially in the beginning of the season to make sure everything is working properly.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://fthmb.tqn.com/cdSRpwme3ay6YA4qaJ3EopiUtbM=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/lawn-sprinklers-155158227-5796a6865f9b58461f54fe80.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/aKjFsgskuQycxk0E0G1Vd2g60Sg=/735x0/lawn-sprinklers-155158227-5796a6865f9b58461f54fe80.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "todd arbini", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:54:17.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1c621f66394940ccd776b670800194e561ac3e91", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3JTSzjMRuCcDyhYCcpKj_cxGVIxeULByiUFb7Cf8SzDWo-", "site_full": "www.thespruce.com", "site": "thespruce.com", "site_section": "https://www.thespruce.com/plumbing-4127792", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Plumbing Repair", "title": "Dewinterize a House - Step by Step Guide", "title_full": "Dewinterize a House - Step by Step Guide", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fthmb.tqn.com/qplkmT_gllsMO0c8XrL1-WMfn5w=/2121x1414/filters:fill(auto,1)/winter-storm-549827757-5796b0f93df78ceb86aa30d1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1c621f66394940ccd776b670800194e561ac3e91", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3JTSzjMRuCcDyhYCcpKj_cxGVIxeULByiUFb7Cf8SzDWo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aaron Stickley", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dewinterize a House - Step by Step Guide", "text": "Todd Ryburn Photography / Getty Images It is necessary to dewinterize a house to reverse winterizing on a house that has been empty during the cold season. When a house has been winterized it usually means that the water was shut off and drained down in most of the plumbing system to prevent freezing. Sometimes flex lines are disconnected from sinks, toilets, dishwashers and wash machines as well. Water heaters are usually drained and the water flex lines are sometimes left disconnected from the water heater or water softeners .\nAnother form of winterizing is done by filling the water lines and drain line traps with RV anti-freeze. This anti-freeze is usually poured into the dishwasher and washing machines and cycled a little bit to get it into the traps of the machines so nothing freezes and breaks. To dewinterize a house that was winterized by a professional service sometimes it is easier to just have them come back and reverse the process because they know exactly what was done. If you can\u2019t have the same professional or don\u2019t know who winterized a house there are some basic steps you can follow to do it yourself.\nHow to Begin Dewinterizing a house will require checking every fixture before you even begin to turn on the water. Go around to every fixture and make sure that the flex lines are connected. Check the sinks, toilets, icemaker, dishwasher, water heater, and whatever else you might have in the house that is connected to the water supply.\nConnect anything that was disconnected before turning on the water.\nGo around and turn off the shut-off valves on anything with a dedicated valve like sinks, toilets, and the dishwasher line. If you do this you can slowly go around and test each fixture individually. This can give you more time and decrease the mess that can occur in case you find multiple leaks.\nIf it is an older house and you do not think the shut-off valves will work, or they will leak if you turn them on and off then you might skip this step. Skipping this means you will have to be extra careful to check for leaks before anything floods. You can also turn off the hot water heater that way you can just test the cold water sides before turning on the hot water side.\nTurning on the Water Having extra people will help when turning on the water so that you can spot leaks quickly. Turn the water on slowly at the main water supply. Let the water in a tub run if you can. Turn the water on to each fixture and let it run for a few minutes. It is safer to do this one fixture at a time.Once the air is out of each line the leaks, if any, may begin to show up so keep coming back to check.\nNote: If you have pressure balanced shower valves you will have to turn on the shut-off valve above the water heater to get water out of the valve.\nFlush the Toilets Toilets can leak from the seals between the tank and the bowl. Test them by flushing each toilet several times. Keep an eye out for water leaking or pooling at the base of the toilet. Check the inside of each toilet tank and make sure it fills properly and shut off completely.\nExterior Faucets Freeze-proof faucets can leak after dewinterizing as well. Go around and try every exterior spigot to make sure that a fair amount of water is coming out and that they are working well. Low pressure here may mean there is a split in the shaft causing a leak. To be sure these are not leaking you may need to go under the house if it is on a raised floor.\nKeep Checking Run plenty of water at each fixture and check every drain. Take your time by running water everywhere and double checking that everything is ok. Not all problems are visible right away so keep checking back. If you can check under the house do a crawl and make sure nothing is leaking under there. Have water pipes in the attic? Then check up in the attic and make sure you do not see any water leaking.

It will need to hide under the playing card so it\u2019s not seen.\nContinue to 4 of 4 below. 04 of 04 Levitating and Spinning the Card I'll assume that you will levitate the card over your left hand. If you want to float the card over your right hand, just reverse the instructions.\nBring out the gimmicked playing card. Be sure not to show the side with the plastic strip.\nPositioning the Card With the gimmicked card face-up (plastic strip side down), grab the card with your right hand - fingers along the length-wise portion of the card and your thumb on the other side.\nPlace the card so that the plastic strip rests across your ... MORE left hand with one end against the base of your left thumb and the other against the base of your left pinkie finger. After positioning the playing card, you should feel the edge of the plastic strip resting against the base of your thumb and the other edge resting against the base of your pinkie.\nIf you need to, use your right hand to casually adjust the playing card so that the edges of the plastic strip are resting in the correct spot. With practice and experience, you'll know when the card feels \"right.\"\nTwist the card clockwise, a little less than about a quarter turn in place. You\u2019ll feel the adhesive dot resisting the movement. It\u2019s the dot that causes the card to make a quarter turn as you levitate it. Don\u2019t twist the card too far as you\u2019ll expose the plastic strip.\nOnce the card is positioned correctly, let go of it with your right hand.\nLevitating the Card At this point, squeeze your left thumb and left pinkie to apply inward pressure to the plastic strip. You\u2019ll find that the plastic strip will begin to arch up or bow and lift the playing card above the palm of your hand. Try to make the movement of your thumb and pinkie slow and subtle so that it won\u2019t be noticed. The card should just appear to float up off your hand. Also, because of the adhesive dot and the twisting that you initially did, the card will slowly turn as it levitates and rises.\nIt\u2019s important that you watch your angles - where spectators are watching. Ideally, your spectators will be looking down onto the card and your hand. If your hand is at their eye-level, they will undoubtedly spot the plastic strip and they will discover the secret.\nWhen the card is at the top of its \u201clevitation,\u201d don\u2019t hold it too long. It's just a momentary thing. At this point, simply grab the card with your other hand as if you snatching it out of the air. This levitation is a brief one. It should capture the attention of your spectators and just when they are starting to think about how it may be done, you grab the card\nYou have caused a card to mysteriously float above your hand.\nYou can learn other methods to float a playing card here .\nYou can watch a video of the levitation with a playing card here.\nInterested in learning the latest magic tricks?

Besides, it's way cooler to tell a fellow collector on an action figure forum that you picked up some nice 1:10 scale figures. It's all part of the lingo.\nThe term scale refers to the size ratio to a normal sized object. In this case, we're talking about smaller representations of the human figure. For standardization purposes, toy companies refer to the usual ideal human figure as being 6 feet tall (we're usually talking about heroic figures such as Batman or Darth Vader, hence the height). Therefore an action figure that is also 6 feet tall would have a 1:1 ratio. A 3-foot tall action figure would have a 1:2 ratio and so on.\nOver the years, some standards scales have been used in the action figure world. Take a look at the most common, starting from largest to smallest.\n1:4 Scale (aprox. 18\") This scale is one of the largest common scales for action figures and is technically reserved for dolls if we're going by the doll/action figure definition , as they often have \"real\" hair or cloth clothing. Examples of this format can be found in Sideshow's Premium Format figures and the superhero dolls made by Tonner.\n1:6 Scale (aprox. 12\") This scale holds a special place in action figure history as it was the original size of the very first figure to sport the \"action figure\" moniker, G.I. Joe. This was the reigning scale for action figures during the first decade or so after G.I. Joe hit the market and many companies toyed with 12\" figures of their own, including the 12\" Star Wars dolls from Kenner in the late '70s and Mego's 12\" line of superhero dolls, featuring Batman, Superman and a TV tie-in version of Wonder Woman.\n1:9 Scale (aprox. 8\") This scale is pretty much exclusive to the Mego toy company's World's Greatest Heroes line of 8\" action figures that ruled the toy aisles in the late '70s and early '80s. Other toy companies were quick to follow, such as Ideal with their famous monsters and Evel Knievel lines. This size became so popular, in fact, that G.I. Joe himself shrunk down to this size (although a petroleum shortage needed to make plastic didn't help, either).\n1:10 Scale (aprox. 7\") For today's collectors, the 1:10 scale seems to be the king of the hill. Several action figure lines are being produced in this format from Mattel's DC Universe to Marvel's Legends line. Mattel has made an even bigger splash with their Masters of the Universe Classics line that re-imagines the old school fantasy figures in a newer 7\" scale. This size tends to be more popular with adult collectors than with children looking for play value.\n1:18 Scale (aprox. 3.75\" - 4\") Mego started it with their Pocket Heroes line in the late '70s, followed shortly thereafter by Fisher Price with their Adventure People line, but it would be Kenner's massively popular Star Wars collection that would set the unshakable standard for action figures of this scale for almost 20 years.\nFigures in this scale were less expensive, easier to fit into vehicles and loads of fun to collect. Toy lines such as G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero did extremely well in this size as did many movie figures, such as Indiana Jones and Tron and figures based on TV shows, like The Dukes of Hazzard and ChiPs .\nAlthough 3.75\" was the standard in this scale, a proper 1:18 scale figure should be 4\", and a recent resurgence in popularity of this size has brought us several new figure lines from Marvel, DC Comics, G.I. Joe and Star Wars.\n1:12 Scale (aprox. 5\" - 6\") Chances are if the figure was based on a movie made during the '90s ( Last Action Hero, Congo, Jurassic Park, Super Mario Brothers ) their action figures were this size. Throughout the 1990s, figures ranging between 5-6\" took over the action figure world, pretty much killing the 3.75\" figures and setting a new standard.\nAlthough not very popular today, figures in this scale will never be forgotten.\n1:48 Scale (aprox. 2\") It should be noted that with the rise in popularity and collectability of figures such as Lego \"minifigs\" and other miniature, yet fully articulated, figures from other building sets such as Mega Bloks, the 2\" tall figure is starting to hold its own and is beginning to command respect in the collectibles world. These figures may very well one day be the reigning scale standard in the not too distant future, so they get an honorable mention here.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "superman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "batman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dc universe to marvel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mattel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dc comics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pocket heroes", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "congo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:09:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8d29a44c227ac4e9f5305c54bdeffeccdd241f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3JWUqKaU6dpM9pfSCmMzymPT1STXcfjIR0HzrZ22GEQO701B1TofbnLMtgMNbLE5Jv", "site_full": "www.thespruce.com", "site": "thespruce.com", "site_section": "https://www.thespruce.com/laundry-4127892", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Laundry", "title": "5 Laundry Products Everyone Should Have", "title_full": "5 Laundry Products Everyone Should Have", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://fthmb.tqn.com/lZ2aCRfQOXFgO-9Lty1SW2TUp_g=/2575x3870/filters:fill(auto,1)/storage-88302794-56a02e795f9b58eba4af4720.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f8d29a44c227ac4e9f5305c54bdeffeccdd241f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3JWUqKaU6dpM9pfSCmMzymPT1STXcfjIR0HzrZ22GEQO701B1TofbnLMtgMNbLE5Jv", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mary Marlowe Leverette", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "5 Laundry Products Everyone Should Have", "text": "Photo by Anthony-Masterson / The Image Bank / Getty Images Whether you are stocking a laundry room for the first time or need some advice on purchasing only the products you really need for laundry, there are the five laundry products you should always have on hand\u2013detergent, oxygen bleach, disinfectant, baking soda and distilled white vinegar. With these basics, you'll always have clean laundry.\n01 of 05 Laundry Detergent Anthony Rosenberg / E+ / Getty Images When you visit a store's laundry products aisle, you'll find an almost overwhelming array of laundry detergents . Some claim to be absolutely necessary for specific fabrics and types of clothing.\nDetergents are now offered in liquid, powder or single dose pacs formats. All of them clean clothes well. However, liquid detergents are very effect on greasy, oily stains and can be easily used as a stain pretreater. Powdered detergents are usually less expensive to use per load. They are ... MORE effective on clay and ground-in dirt. Single dose detergents are convenient and simple to use. They are typically more expensive to use on a per load basis.\nAlmost all brands are now formulated to use in high-efficiency front load or top load washers; just look for the \"he\" (high-efficiency) symbol to be sure. You may actually have a hard time finding a detergent without the symbol, but rest assured that you can use he laundry detergent in a standard top load washer .\nWhether you decide on liquid, pods or powder, remember that price isn't always the best indicator of how well a detergent will perform in cleaning your clothes. The key is to look at the list of ingredients on the product label. The more active ingredients listed in the formula, like enzymes that break down stains and surfactants that lift the soil away from fabric and suspend it in the water; the better the detergent will perform.\nIf you select a liquid heavy duty detergent ( Tide , Persil ) that includes the enzymes, surfactants and other ingredients to remove most stains and heavy soil, you can use it to pre-treat stains and there's no need for a separate stain remover.\nIf you choose a less expensive detergent, you'll also need to purchase an enzyme-based stain remover .\nYou'll see detergents specifically marketed for baby's laundry because they are hypo-allergenic and less harsh on sensitive skin. You can simply choose a fragrance and dye free detergent because it is these ingredients that is most often the cause of skin reactions.\n02 of 05 Oxygen Bleach Mark Viker / The Image Bank / Getty Oxygen or all-fabric bleach works mores slowly and gently than chlorine bleach and contains sodium perborate or sodium precarbonate. It is safe for use on all washable fabrics\u2013except silk, wool and leather\u2013 and for all colors and white fabrics. It can be used in any temperature water.\nWhen this bleach is used in the wash, the chemical ingredient oxidizes to help remove soil and organic matter and brightens the fabric. Fabrics will receive the most impact of stain removal and whitening and ... MORE brightening by allowing them to soak for at least one hour and up to eight hours. Your patience will pay off!\nOxygen bleach does not disinfect fabrics of viruses and bacteria.\n03 of 05 Disinfectant Stephen Welstead / Corbis / Getty Images There are times after an illness or if someone in the family has an infection that laundry needs to be disinfected . This can be done with chlorine bleach, pine oil disinfectants, phenolic disinfectants or quaternary disinfectants.\nIn addition to disinfecting, when chlorine bleach is used in washing laundry, the chemical ingredient oxidizes helping to remove soil and organic matter. It generally whitens fabrics by removing dyes left by stains or general soil. Care should be taken to use chlorine ... MORE bleach properly because it can also damage fabrics.\n04 of 05 Baking Soda Michelle Arnold / EyeEm / Getty Images Odors and general grime in our laundry can usually be removed as the detergent molecules break up the bacteria cells and soil. However, in certain types of water, the detergent needs a boost to work more effectively.\nBaking soda helps regulate the pH level in the washer water by keeping it from being too acidic or alkaline. By adding 1/2 cup of baking soda to each laundry load, detergents can work more effectively to reduce bacteria and loosen soil.\nAs a natural mineral, baking soda also helps ... MORE absorb odors from fabrics. Adding one cup of baking soda to tub of water and allowing stinky clothes to soak overnight can remove odors is less harsh on the environment than synthetic products.\nContinue to 5 of 5 below. 05 of 05 Distilled White Vinegar Vinegar. MML Distilled white vinegar has many uses as a fabric softener, odor remover and stain remover in the laundry room.\nThe mild acid in distilled white vinegar acts as a whitener and brightens dingy clothes in the laundry. To get stained white socks and dingy cotton dishcloths white again, add 1 cup white distilled vinegar to a large pot of water. Heat to boiling and add the articles.

It would be nice if all of the T-ball, softball, and baseball leagues had managers who whisked away the dirty uniforms and a nice, clean one magically appeared on game day. But since that is reserved for the chosen few, here are some tips for keeping baseball uniforms looking their best.\nKnow the Material of Your Baseball Uniform Remember the episode on Seinfeld when George Costanza switched the Yankees from their versatile stretchy synthetic uniforms to restrictive cotton uniforms? It was a disaster because the cotton shrank and the players couldn\u2019t throw, hit, or run comfortably. That\u2019s why almost every baseball uniform is made from heavy weight stretchable polyester knit or mesh. The fabric is durable, has stretch for ease of movement, and is actually easier to care for than cotton.\nPolyester fabric should be washed in warm water and either air dried or tumble dried on low heat. Excessively high heat can cause shrinkage of the fabric and set in stains.\nBaseball caps are in a league unto themselves. Daily wear and collectible baseball caps need an entirely different cleaning technique.\nPresoak to Remove Stains from Baseball Pants Presoaking is essential in getting your baseball uniform clean.\nAfter the game, rinse off the uniform with cool water in a utility sink to remove as much loose dirt and mud as possible. If you don\u2019t have a large sink, hang the uniform over a clothesline and spray it down with a hose.\nNext fill the sink or bucket with warm\u2013not hot\u2013water. Add 1/4 cup heavy duty laundry detergent which has the cleaning enzymes and surfactants needed to lift away stains ( Tide or Persil are leading brand names) and one cup of baking soda to help with odor; then soak the uniform for at least one hour.\nIt is even better if it can soak overnight. Obviously, if you are the team Mom or Dad and have more than one uniform, increase the amount of detergent and baking soda accordingly.\nIt is important to know if the water in your area is hard or soft. Hard water contains an excess of minerals that make detergents much less effective in removing soil. If you have hard water , your uniform will be harder to clean and you will need to add some water conditioner to your presoak bucket. This is not fabric softener; it is an additive that helps your detergent work better.\nBlood, Sweat, and Grass Stains Skip the hot water for any blood stains and use cold water instead. Hot water will only set the stains and make them nearly impossible to remove.\nWhile the presoaking technique will usually take care of most stains; inspect the uniform before you put it into wash and treat any remaining stains with a stain remover like Shout or by rubbing in extra heavy duty detergent. If there are tough red mud stains, add a scoop of oxygen bleach or borax to boost cleaning power.\nIt is important to always wash underwear and socks in hot water to kill bacteria and the fungus of athlete's foot .\nNo Steroids or Chlorine Bleach in Baseball to Whiten and Brighten Chlorine bleach has many appropriate uses, just like steroids, but not in baseball.\nIt may be tempting to use chlorine bleach on white or even gray uniforms but it is not effective for polyester fabrics and can even damage the material. Chlorine bleach strips away the outer coating on the man-made polyester threads and exposes the inner yellow core.\nInstead, use an oxygen or all-fabric bleach (brand names are: OxiClean, Nellie's All Natural Oxygen Brightener, or OXO Brite) to brighten and whiten. Mix a solution of oxygen bleach and warm water following package directions creating enough to completely submerge the uniform. Again, allow the uniform to soak for at least four hours to get results, overnight is best, and then wash as usual.\nWash Baseball Uniforms Alone Baseball may be a team sport but the uniform should travel alone through the washing machine. Do not wash the uniform with other clothes.\nMost clothes contain cotton or a cotton blend. The lint will come off and cling to the jersey\u2019s letters and numbers. After the uniform has pre-soaked, fill the washer with cool water and detergent and wash on the permanent press cycle. Never use hot water. Even if the uniform is white, the lettering and numbers are colored and can fade.\nForget the Heat of a Dryer Never put a sports uniform in a hot clothes dryer . High heat causes shrinking, sets in stains and fades colors. Hang the uniform to air dry away from direct sunlight.

But after just one washing, it is covered with little knots of thread. No one ever wants those little ugly bobbles of fuzz or pills on clothes. A really bad look.\nWhat Causes Pills to Appear on Clothes? Pills appear on the surface of fabric when groups of short or broken fibers on the surface of the fabric become tangled together in a tiny ball-a pill.\nThe pills form because of rubbing or abrasion during normal wear and use and is usually found on the areas of clothing or linens that receive the most abrasion in day-to-day use, such as center of bed sheets, under the arms of clothes, around the collar and cuffs of a shirt, and between the thighs and on the rear of pants; but can happen anywhere on fabric.\nWhile it is difficult to predict which fabrics will pill, there are some types of fabrics and fibers that are more prone to pilling. Knitted fabrics tend to pill more than woven fabrics because the threads are more loose. Fabrics made of long fibers like silk and linen pill less than wool, cotton, polyester, and other synthetic threads. When fibers are mixed in a fabric like a cotton/polyester blend, one fiber is usually much stronger than the other. The weaker fiber will break, attach to the stronger fiber and a pill is formed.\nThe pill, unfortunately, becomes a magnet for other loose threads in a wash load and the two become entangled.\nThat's why a black fabric ends up with little white knots. That white knot is fuzz from another fabric.\nHow to Prevent Pills on Clothes For clothes that you suspect will pill, use the washer's gentle cycle. The slower agitation and shorter wash cycle will protect your clothes. Or, choose hand washing which is even more gentle. Before washing any garment , by hand or in a washer, turn the garment inside out. This prevents excessive abrasion to the surface of the fabric from other clothes, zippers, and buttons. Sort clothes properly before washing . Washing delicate items in the same load as jeans will cause more abrasion and harm to the surface of fabrics. Avoid washing lint producing fabrics like terry cloth with other clothes. If there are broken fibers on polyester, the lint from terry cloth is going to cling tightly to the polyester surface. Do not overload the washer. Cramming it as full as possible does not leave room for clothes to move easily and causes damage to the surface of clothes. Skip harsh cleaners and damaging bleaches which can weaken fibers causing them to break and pill. Choose a laundry detergent that contains the enzyme cellulase. The enzyme will help break down cotton pills and remove them. Add a commercial fabric softener to the rinse cycle. The ingredients in fabric softener coat the fibers of the fabric so that abrasion is lessened. Avoid the clothes dryer. Line dry woven fabrics and dry knitted garments on a flat surface. If using the dryer , remove delicate items as soon as possible to lessen abrasion from other fabrics. How to Select Clothes That Will Not Pill While there is no promise that a fabric will never pill, there are some tricks that will keep your clothes looking their best longer.\nAvoid fabrics that are fiber blends. Knitted or woven fabrics that combine different types of threads-especially those that combine natural and synthetic fibers-are more likely to pill. Check the label before you purchase an item. Choose woven fabrics over knits. Woven fabrics pill less than knits. Of course we love our knits, so choose one that is tightly knit over a looser knit. How to Remove Pilling from Clothes One of the most effective ways to remove pills is to use a fabric comb or a battery operated pill and fuzz remover that shaves the pills from the surface of the garment. These will pull the knotted fibers away from the surface of the fabric.\nYou can also pull the fabric taut over a curved surface and carefully cut off the pills with small, sharp scissors or shave the fabric surface with a safety razor. You must be extremely careful and weigh the value of the garment before tackling the job!\nWhen a Pill Becomes a Snag On occasion a small pill can become a snag if one of the longer fibers gets caught in the mix.

You're not sorting your dirty laundry correctly.\nSorting laundry seems to be a mystery to some so they dump everything in together.\nBut wait, you say you're using one of those detergents and color catcher cloths that claim you can wash everything together? Don't believe everything you read. (That's where lots of problems begin.)\nClothes need to be sorted by color, fabric type and weight, and washing instructions. It really isn't so hard. Follow these simple steps and you will soon be doing laundry like a pro.\nHow to Sort Laundry Before Washing There are four steps to sorting laundry before washing or cleaning. You can wait until there is a mountain of laundry and the sorting will be tedious. Or since you know that there will be dirty clothes and linens that need to be cleaned each and every day, you can make it simple by sorting laundry as you take off or use each item.\nUse separate laundry hampers or a laundry hamper with sorting sections in your closet, bathroom, or central area. If the hamper doesn't have labels, you can add them and even post the rules for laundry hamper for your kids.\nOne section should be for whites, one section for dark colors, one section for light colors, and one section for dry clean only.\nEven if you have to do a bit of last minute decision making when the load is pulled from the hamper, presorting will speed up your laundry routine and help insure your efforts are successful.\nSorting Clothes: Step One If you are very familiar with your regular laundry, you probably won't have to do this step every time. But if you are teaching a child how to do laundry , it is a very important step. Read the care label on each item in the hamper.\nThe label will tell you whether an item can be machine washed and even at what what temperature and how to dry it. Place all clothes that are labeled, \u201cwash separately\u201d or \u201c hand wash \u201d into a separate pile.\nIf you are a novice on how to do laundry, if it says \u201cdry clean only\u201d believe the label and place it in a bag to take to a professional dry cleaner. With some experience, you will learn that some items labeled as dry clean only can be hand washed . You'll also learn how to use a DIY home dry cleaning kit in your dryer.\nSorting Clothes: Step Two Once the hand wash and dry clean only clothes are separated, sort the remaining washable laundry by color. Whites, pastels, light gray, and white background prints will go in one pile. Dark colored clothes\u2013black, red, navy, brown, dark gray\u2013go in another pile.\nSorting Clothes: Step Three Sort each pile one more time by type of fabric . For instance, in the white/light colored pile separate towels and sheets from blouses, slacks, and underwear or lingerie.\nIn the dark colors, separate t-shirts and jeans from lighter weight items like blouses and dress shirts. If you have dark towels or blankets, separate them from clothes to reduce lint, never wash lint producing fabrics and lint attracting fabrics together!\nWashing by color and fabric type allows you to use the correct water temperatures and keeps drying cycles simple .\nSorting Clothes: Step Four Not everyone will need to do this step but if you have heavily soiled items with ground-in dirt or oily stains like motor oil or lots of cooking oil stains, sort as usual but wash these items separately. This will prevent heavy soil from redepositing on other clothing. It will also prevent strong odors from transferring to other fabrics.\nFinal Tip Don't make this a habit, but if there are not enough items to make up a full machine load of each type of fabric and you are in a hurry, you can wash all of each color together.\nJust be sure to choose the washer cycle and use cold water to fit the most delicate garments in the load.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://fthmb.tqn.com/U7OKioRa7N_Mw27d3kE5Cl8CKos=/735x0/iStock-532334642-58b05ee73df78cdcd88141ce.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/tJ_EzdQys2KyIou9q1el_qwVhlk=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/iStock-532334642-58b05ee73df78cdcd88141ce.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:17:46.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "326b858c987801add06c8b08953be877926a6dbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3JJ.U.zBgkxf39mJ5NcdZSsHSIgNRpqnqCK25JKk2Soexxdbqdl2jTjW7w3yLu7MwC", "site_full": "www.thespruce.com", "site": "thespruce.com", "site_section": "https://www.thespruce.com/laundry-tips-4127891", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Laundry How-Tos &amp; Tips", "title": "How to Clean a Front Load Washer to Prevent Odor", "title_full": "How to Clean a Front Load Washer to Prevent Odor", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fthmb.tqn.com/IpDZYQO7lJThIDiNCdH1HUjMtwY=/2123x1415/filters:fill(auto,1)/152803950-58a4bc733df78c345b7089d6.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "326b858c987801add06c8b08953be877926a6dbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3JJ.U.zBgkxf39mJ5NcdZSsHSIgNRpqnqCK25JKk2Soexxdbqdl2jTjW7w3yLu7MwC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mary Marlowe Leverette", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Clean a Front Load Washer to Prevent Odor", "text": "Guido Mieth/Moment/Getty Images Front load washers are gaining popularity in the United States. These high-efficiency washers that use less water to clean a load of laundry are a standard design in Europe and around the world. But, the transition from top loaders to front loaders has been difficult for many in the United States and has resulted in washers that develop and hold funky odors and have mechanical problems due to improper use and cleaning.\nOver time, residue from laundry detergents and fabric softeners may cling to the inside of the washer especially on and behind rubber door seals. In warm, humid weather or laundry room conditions, mildew or mold may form, particularly if you have forgotten damp clothes in the washer for a few hours. Keeping the washer clean is an important step in keeping your laundry fresh.\nTo keep your front load washer operating smoothly, here are some tips for proper and thorough cleaning. Your washer should be cleaned monthly or more often if you have exceptionally heavily soiled clothes or live in a hot, humid area.\nHow to Clean the Inside of a Front Load Washer Note: Before you begin, be sure the washer is completely empty of laundry. Add 1/2 cup of liquid chlorine bleach to the detergent compartment of the dispenser drawer and also fill the bleach dispenser compartment with chlorine bleach to the highest level and run on the normal cycle setting with warm water. You can also use one full cup of hydrogen peroxide in the dispensers to run a cleaning cycle. Or, use a commercial washer cleaner. Follow the package directions for amount to use and the procedure. DO NOT MIX WITH OTHER CLEANERS. When the cycle is complete, use a soft, absorbent cloth to dry around the washer door opening, flexible gasket, and door glass. These areas should be cleaned and maintained regularly to ensure a water tight seal. It is a good idea to wipe these down with a dry cloth after every load. Take the time to clean the inside of the door gaskets and the edges. Dirt and residue can get trapped and mold begin to grow on the backside of the gaskets. When extremely soiled or oil-soaked items have been washed, a dirty residue may remain on the drum. Remove this by wiping the drum with a nonabrasive household cleanser and then rinse thoroughly with water. Or, repeat the entire cleaning cycle using chlorine bleach. If your washer has any plastic in the drum, it may become stained from fabric dye. Clean these plastic parts with a nonabrasive household cleanser or repeat the bleach cleaning cycle. This prevents dye transfer to future loads. How to Clean Washing Machine Dispenser Drawers Detergent and fabric softener may build up in the dispenser drawers and residue should be removed once or twice a month. Never overfill the drawers to prevent damaging electronic components of the washer.\nConsult your washer user manual to learn how to remove the drawer. Most have a safety latch but can be removed easily. If the drawer has inserts for the bleach and fabric softener compartments, remove those from the drawer to clean separately. Rinse the drawer and inserts with hot tap water to remove traces of accumulated powders and liquids. If they are particularly coated with built up residue, allow them to soak for ten minutes in hot water and then rinse. Allow drawers to air dry. Use a small soft brush to clean the drawer opening on the washer. Remove all residue from the upper and lower parts of the recess. When the drawer and inserts are clean, return the bleach and fabric softener inserts to their proper compartments. Replace the dispenser drawer and run a short cycle, like the Prewash cycle, without any laundry in the drum to completely flush the system. How to Clean the Outside of the Washer Weekly, when washing is completed, wipe the top and sides of washer with a damp cloth. As needed, clean the outside cabinet with mild soap and water. Never use harsh, gritty or abrasive cleansers. If the door or console becomes stained or there is mildew growth, clean with diluted chlorine bleach-1/4 cup in 1 quart water. Rinse several times with clear water. Remove any glue residue from tape or labels with a mixture of warm water and mild detergent. Never store or place laundry products on top of the washer at any time.

No tights, no yoga pants, no comfortable waistbands, no shapewear. Or, equally as disturbing, knits that stretch and stretch and stretch but don't retain their shape. We would be a pretty uncomfortable and ugly group. The introduction of fibers like elastane, spandex, and lycra that stretch and return to their original state changed the world of fabrics, fashion and active wear clothes.\nHow to Care For Spandex, Lycra, and Elastane Activewear and Lingerie It is important to treat a spandex, lycra, or elastane garment properly to allow it to retain its elastic qualities as long as possible. The care is quite easy and the garments will last a long time as long as you follow all the \"nevers\".\nNever use hot water when cleaning , use cool or tepid water for both washing and rinsing. Hand-washing is best to prevent excessive stretching. If using a washer, place the spandex garments in a mesh lingerie bag and use the gentle cycle. Never use fabric softener or dryer sheets. Most detergents are safe to use on spandex but you should skip the fabric softener or any combination detergent/fabric softener product. Fabric softener leaves a residue on spandex that can dull the finish and attract bacteria that causes excessive odor. Never use chlorine bleach to whiten or remove stains from any fabric containing spandex as it will destroy the fibers. Oxygen-based bleach (brand names are: OxiClean, Nellie's All Natural Oxygen Brightener, or OXO Brite) is safe to use to brighten and remove stains. Never place any spandex garments in a hot clothes dryer. Hang to drip dry away from direct heat and sun or dry flat. If quicker drying is necessary, use a low temperature on a clothes dryer and check the garment frequently. Never use dry cleaning for garments that contain spandex. If you have clothes that are a blend of fibers and contain spandex, lycra, or elastane and are labeled as dry clean only, a professional cleaner will know how to handle them properly. Never iron clothes that are made of 100 percent spandex fabrics. For clothes that have just a bit of spandex added to other fibers, use a low heat setting on the iron . Keep the iron moving on the fabric and never leave the iron on one spot for too long or melting can occur. How to Remove Stains and Odors from Spandex, Lycra, and Elastine Clothes To remove stains from these fibers, follow the stain removal tips for the specific type of stain . It is particularly important to treat oily stains as soon as possible because they can be difficult to remove.\nTo remove strong odors from clothes that contain spandex, fill a sink or bucket with cool water and add one cup of baking soda. Allow the clothes to soak overnight. Then wash as usual or rinse with cool water and dry in a breezy spot.\nWhat Are Spandex, Lycra, and Elastane? Spandex is a synthetic or man-made fiber manufactured from polyurethane. It is lightweight, highly stretchy and elastic, strong, durable, and non-absorbent to water and oils. First produced in the United States in 1959 by DuPont, it was marketed under the trademarked name Lycra.\nSpandex fibers can be stretched more than five hundred percent without breaking and after stretching repeatedly, return closely to the original length.\nThe fibers are lightweight and soft while being more durable and stronger than rubber. The fibers are resistant to damage from body oils, perspiration, most cosmetic chemicals found in deodorants and lotions.\nSpandex is heat settable during manufacturing. Because of this, clothes can be molded into permanent rounded or flat shapes. The fibers can be dyed and are resistant to abrasion and are easy to cut and sew. While Spandex can be used alone to weave a fabric, it is very often combined with natural fibers like cotton and wool as well as other man-made fibers like polyester or nylon to give stretchy qualities to fabrics.\nToday the spandex fibers, a term only used in the United States, are often labeled as Elastane or EL which is recognized worldwide and used in compression garments and sportswear or for any garment where comfort and a more conforming fit is desired.\nSpandex is found in swimsuits, hosiery, waist bands, lingerie-especially shapewear-and even disposable diapers.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://fthmb.tqn.com/SvQXxHr9G5kClsgGJYgvAuwMztQ=/735x0/467761965-56a58e5a5f9b58b7d0dd6924.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/gr3hDo_LxNOJwwU3RD_nN1QDdMs=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/467761965-56a58e5a5f9b58b7d0dd6924.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nellie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elastane", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "oxo brite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dupont", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:21:16.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc1086198d1dadcfeae4a159ee2c732717d55177", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3JJZY23BcrFvjoru6DHV0CREUk_T794kVifNXAGfqOHwEDak0PttD14ayJi_s9qYi5", "site_full": "www.thespruce.com", "site": "thespruce.com", "site_section": "https://www.thespruce.com/laundry-cleaning-and-care-by-fabric-4127884", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Cleaning &amp; Care by Fabric", "title": "How to Wash Down Coats, Comforters, and Sleeping Bags", "title_full": "How to Wash Down Coats, Comforters, and Sleeping Bags", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fthmb.tqn.com/DP4khtp-Y3j1LixZYHOzYwgh33c=/4958x3676/filters:fill(auto,1)/GettyImages-200185962-018-56a5929c5f9b58b7d0dd70de.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc1086198d1dadcfeae4a159ee2c732717d55177", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3JJZY23BcrFvjoru6DHV0CREUk_T794kVifNXAGfqOHwEDak0PttD14ayJi_s9qYi5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mary Marlowe Leverette", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Wash Down Coats, Comforters, and Sleeping Bags", "text": "Getty: Melissa McManus/Getty Images Down items can be expensive but if cared for properly, down retains its loft and insulating properties up to three times longer than most synthetic fillers. However, it must be handled correctly because if the feathers are left damp, they will absorb and retain odors and, even worse, mildew .\nHow to Wash Down-Filled Items It may be those horror stories about wet down that is keeping you from washing your down items.\nBut, they can be safely washed as long as you also dry them properly. For pillows and comforters, washing is important to curb allergic reactions. Many people think they have feather allergies but they actually have reactions to dust mites that have permeated the down. Washing will remove the mites and make the items usable for years to come.\nDown items are fully washable unless the outer covering is dry clean only. Check the care label and follow those guidelines. All you need it wash down are:\nLiquid down cleaner: A down cleaner like Granger's Down Wash or Nikwax Down Wash is formulated to remove soil and odor while retaining the moisture repellent qualities of the feathers. If you do not have down wash available, use a gentle, low-sudsing detergent. Harsh detergents can strip the feathers of their natural oils. Front load or HE Top Load Washer : A washer without a center agitator is preferable for washing down-filled items because it is more gentle on the outer fabric. Plus, front load washers have a higher capacity and will accommodate large items like comforters, sleeping bags, and pillows. Dryer with Low Heat Setting : Down can NEVER be dried at a high temperature. If your dryer isn't working reliably on low heat, go visit a neighbor! Drying must be done low and slow. When you're ready to wash, pretreat any heavily stained areas with a bit of the down wash. If you have tough specific stains, follow the recommendations for that particular stain.\nWork it into the soiled area with a soft brush and allow to work for at least 15 minutes before washing. Use cool or warm water and the permanent press setting. Don't use too much detergent! If the item feels \"sudsy\" when the cycle is over, you've used too much and need to put the item through an extra rinse cycle.\nIf the item is heavily soiled all over, allow it to soak in the water and detergent solution for an hour or so before washing. If your washer won't allow a presoak cycle, use the bathtub or a very large plastic storage tub.\nPlan to spend some extra time near the dryer as you dry the down item. Place the down filled item in the dryer and add several wool dryer balls (or clean tennis balls) to help break up the clumps of feathers. You will need to remove the item from the dryer every ten minutes to manually fluff it up. Your hands are the best clump busters around.\nIf you must air dry the down item, place it flat on a drying rack and fluff often. Air drying can take several days up to one week. Be diligent about turning and fluffing to prevent souring of the feathers or mildew growth. Do not place in direct sun but be sure the area is warm and well-ventilated. A circulating fan will help.\nHow to Choose the Best Down Fill If you're looking for a way to stay warm and dry during the coldest of climates, just turn to our feathered friends for inspiration. The same soft, fine feathers that insulate birds from cold winds will do the same thing for us.\nYou can find down in coats, vests, pillows, comforters, and sleeping bags. There are several types and varying quality levels of down. The three most common offerings are:\nGoose down : Geese have the largest down clusters, with the Hungarian Goose producing what is most widely considered to be the finest down. Due to the size of the goose down, the larger clusters offer more loft and insulating qualities. Duck down : Since ducks are smaller, their down is smaller and more coarse than that of a goose. However, Eider Duck down is larger and considered to be of good quality. Feather-Down Combinations : Because down can compact with use and age, many pillows and heavy usage items are filled with a combination of down and feathers. The feathers add bulk and stabilize the down. Clothing and household goods that contain down in the United States are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. A product labeled \"100 percent Down\" must contain only down feathers. Products labeled as \"Down\" can contain a mixture of down, feathers and other fibers. Anything labeled as \"Goose Down\"-usually the most expensive-must contain at least 90 percent goose down and feathers.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://fthmb.tqn.com/9AT_O5HMyuIDCW1TqHzHR4PhSGM=/735x0/GettyImages-200185962-018-56a5929c5f9b58b7d0dd70de.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/rMkcdYMlWUUii9-_MvG8HXd_l4s=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/GettyImages-200185962-018-56a5929c5f9b58b7d0dd70de.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "melissa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "granger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal trade commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:21:34.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f7a36c204332b7d2e578f06d9a73f947341f86ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3JJZY23BcrFvi673yzQ_WY1Ato14nR1acOgQe5yffLnf5M4e7zQwGSZQ--", "site_full": "www.thespruce.com", "site": "thespruce.com", "site_section": "https://www.thespruce.com/laundry-cleaning-and-care-by-fabric-4127884", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Cleaning &amp; Care by Fabric", "title": "How to Care for Natural Fur and Faux Fur Hats", "title_full": "How to Care for Natural Fur and Faux Fur Hats", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "https://fthmb.tqn.com/QH4APOtIkstTtjqsYxGYVR_dHcU=/5200x3460/filters:fill(auto,1)/GettyImages-678840189-58c173143df78c353c177212.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f7a36c204332b7d2e578f06d9a73f947341f86ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3JJZY23BcrFvi673yzQ_WY1Ato14nR1acOgQe5yffLnf5M4e7zQwGSZQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mary Marlowe Leverette", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Care for Natural Fur and Faux Fur Hats", "text": "Janina Laszlo / STOCK4B / Getty Images Whether the hat is made of natural or faux fur, fur hats are some of the warmest winter hats available. And even if there's just a bit of fur trim, both types of fur need some special care to keep them looking their best and to provide long-lasting wear.\nHow to Care for Real Fur Hats and Trim Whether you have a mink, fox, or rabbit fur hat, proper care will make it last many, many years. Natural fur hats should be protected from chemicals like make-up, perfume and hair products; so, ever apply these products while wearing the hat.\nAfter every wearing, allow the hat to \"rest\" to help retain its shape and dry completely from body moisture away from direct light and with good air circulation.\nIf your real fur hat gets wet, shake off excess water and allow the fur to dry naturally away from direct heat and sun. Place the hat on a wig or hat form or over a rounded vase or jar so air can circulate freely. This will also prevent the fur from becoming crushed or flattened if placed directly on a hard surface. Never use high heat to dry fur by placing it too close to a heat source, in direct sun, or using a hot blow dryer. When the fur is dry, shake to fluff. If necessary, you may brush the fur with a good quality pet brush to restore the smoothness. Brush lightly in the direction of the fur.\nYour natural fur hat should be cleaned at least annually by a professional fur cleaner-not a dry cleaner . A qualified furrier has the knowledge and equipment to correctly clean furs.\nDry cleaning or immersion in standard dry cleaning chemicals will rob the fur hide of natural oils, dry it out, and cause it to shed. Linings can be cleaned in the hat; or removed and cleaned separately.\nAt the end of the season, have the hat professionally cleaned. If the hat is expensive, consider allowing the furrier to store the hat in climate controlled cool storage.\nAt home, place the hat on a form and cover with a hat box or cotton storage bag to prevent crushing and dust from settling in the fur. Store in a cool, dry location that does not have huge swings in temperature. Do not use plastic storage bags or boxes that can trap moisture and cause mildew problems and avoid chemicals like moth balls and insecticides.\nHow to Care for Faux Fur Hats and Trim When cleaning faux fur, pay close attention to the care label . Most will recommend dry cleaning; but some faux furs can be hand washed or machine-washed . The decision depends upon the fiber content of the faux fur and how the hat is structured, including the lining.\nFaux fur can become distorted from too much wear, dry cleaning, or excessive heat. To maintain the hat's longevity, spot cleaning and good preventative care will work the best. If the fur gets wet after being caught in the rain, allow to air dry by placing the hat on a hat form or jar to allow air to circulate. Dry away from high, direct heat. Never toss in a dryer on a hot setting. If possible, allow a day between wearings to give the hat a chance to air and fibers to relax. This will help it maintain the correct shape.\nIf the faux fur on your hat becomes matted, you may be able to detangle the fibers by mixing one teaspoon of hair conditioner with two cups of water.\nPlace the mixture in a spray bottle and spritz the fur. Use a SOFT bristle brush to gently brush the fur. Work in a small area and work slowly. If fibers come out, then you are brushing too hard. When you are finished, wipe down the area with a clean, white cloth dampened with plain water and allow the hat to air dry.\nIf the faux fur completely looses its luster, it can be trimmed to bring back the sheen.

It\u2019s different from other orchids in that in thrives in wet conditions, even preferring wet feet. You can recognize these flowers by the little pouch flanked by Fu Manchu mustache petals, begging the gardener to anthropomorphize each and every blossom.\nContinue to 19 of 21 below. 19 of 21 Psychopsis Orchid Christine Cimala I\u2019m not sure why the Butterfly Orchid isn\u2019t more popular in the trade: it\u2019s easy to grow, has fascinating flowers, and showy burgundy and green speckled foliage. Grow these in moderate light for months of blooms.\nContinue to 20 of 21 below. 20 of 21 Vanda Orchid Maja Dumat Vanda orchids are as exotic as their name. You will often see them growing in special orchid baskets ; otherwise, you must use a very chunky growing medium for these plants.

looks better with a mature shade tree in it. Trees add permanence and weight to the landscape. To make the tree look like it belongs there, we often ring the base of the trunk with flowers and plants. Unfortunately, as the tree grows and its branches and roots expand, the area around it becomes a barren waste land. The tree roots quickly soak up all available water and do a great job of blocking the sun, so few plants choose to grow there.\nDon't give up and create a volcano of ... MORE mulch around your trees. It is possible to plant under a tree, if you choose wisely and start small. Follow these 10 tips to get plants established and happy growing under there.\nContinue to 2 of 11 below. 02 of 11 When Planting Under a Tree, Don't Kill the Tree in the Process. Carsten Witzel / iStock It's hard to believe, but trees can be very sensitive to any damage to their roots and bark. Some trees, such as beeches, cherries and plums, dogwoods, magnolias, and maples, have very shallow roots that are barely below the soil surface and hate having those roots disturbed. Be very careful digging around the roots. Use a trowel or digging knife, rather than a large hovel. If you encounter a root, move to another spot.\nAlso avoid damaging the bark at the base of the tree. Any injury is an ... MORE invitation for disease and pests to find their way inside the tree.\nContinue to 3 of 11 below. 03 of 11 Start Small \u00a9 Marie Iannotti Since you cannot dig holes to accommodate large plants under your tree, you will need to plant small seedlings or divisions. You may be able to buy small \"liner\" plants in bulk for some mail order nurseries. These are seedlings that are intended to be grown on at nurseries and sold as plants in garden centers. If you can find a source for liners, you'll save a lot of money. Of course, you could always start your own.\nThe main concern is that you want seedlings with small root balls, so you can ... MORE squeeze them in without digging to wide or deeply. This will mean a lot of watering at first, but the small plants will adapt more easily to their cramped quarters than a large plant would and you won't hurt your tree in the process of planing.\nContinue to 4 of 11 below. 04 of 11 Use Only a Few Plant Varieties, but Use Lots of Them. \u00a9 Marie Iannotti Choose a couple of key plants and then plant them in large swaths. This is especially key, since you are going to need to plant very small seedlings.\nConsider including some fast spreading groundcovers , for quick cover, but use caution with this. Plants such as pachysandra, ivy, and ribbon grass (Phalaris arundinacea) will take over the entire yard. Ginger (Asarum), columbine (Aquilegia), and bleeding heart (Dicentra) are better choices.\nContinue to 5 of 11 below. 05 of 11 Don't Ring the Tree, Engulf It \u00a9 Marie Iannotti For a natural look, don't circle the tree with a row of plants. Plant all the way up against the tree's trunk. Let your plants flow around the tree. If you plant sprawlers , such as Foamflower ( Tiarella ) or Laurentia ( Isotoma fluviatilis ) they will create their own boundaries. Of course, you may have to do a bit of thinning, to keep them in check.\nContinue to 6 of 11 below. 06 of 11 Rely on Attractive Foliage. \u00a9 Marie Iannotti You aren't going to get an abundance of flowering in the shade of a tree. To ensure you have a colorful display, choose plants with leaves that look good all season. Good choices include: European ginger ( Asarum europaeum ), Japanese painted ferns ( Athyrium niponicum ), Hosta , coral bells ( Heuchera ), Japanese forest grass ( Hakonechloa macra ), and frilly mayapple ( Podophyllum ). You can create a beautiful tapestry with just the color of leaves.\nContinue to 7 of 11 below. 07 of 11 Plan for Dry Conditions \u00a9 Marie Iannotti It helps if you choose plants that can handle some drought . You will still need to give your plants some TLC for their first year, no matter what you plant. But it will be easier on the plants, and you, if you choose plants that won't need a lot of supplemental watering during dry spells, when the tree's roots will soak up all available moisture.\nContinue to 8 of 11 below. 08 of 11 Expand Your Flowering Season \u00a9 Marie Iannotti Take advantage of early spring, before the tree leafs out, and include flowering bulbs , especially small ones like crocus , dwarf iris , and Glory in the Snow ( Chionodoxa ). Another good choice would be spring ephemerals . Plants like bloodroot ( Sanguinaria canadensis ), Dutchman's breeches ( Dicentra cucullaria ), trillium , and Virginia bluebells ( Mertensia virginica ) tend to disappear, when the temperature warms up, making space for your regular season plants to fill in.\nContinue to 9 of 11 below. 09 of 11 Include Some Surprises. \u00a9 Marie Iannotti To give your underplanting some drama and eye-catching appeal, add a splash of unexpected bold color or unusual texture . It will add another dimension of beauty and make your planting look. Some bright colored leaves fade out in shade, so make sure your drama queen gets some sunlight by planting it toward the outer edge of the branches.\nContinue to 10 of 11 below. 10 of 11 Find a Carpet that Works and Repeat It \u00a9 Marie Iannotti Your yard will be more cohesive if you include the palette of plants you used under your tree in another spot in the garden. Don't just use it under trees, any shady area will work, maybe by a bench or along a path or in that tiny side yard that doesn't have enough space or sun for a flower border.\nContinue to 11 of 11 below. 11 of 11 Keep It Growing \u00a9 Marie Iannotti To keep your tree garden healthy, add a couple of inches of organic mulch or compost . You'll be creating that rich \"forest floor\" effect that makes woodlands grow so lushly. The mulch will help retain precious moisture give the plants a little boost.\nReapply the mulch each year in early spring, before the plants have a chance to leaf out.

You can build a simple DIY pergola out of PVC pipe in one weekend, and who will be the wiser once it's covered in 'Francois Juranville' climbing roses like the one in this photo?

It's OK to go against the grain of the natural color trend for fences and borders in the landscape. Instead of fading into the background, this raised bed stands out as a key design element when painted a vibrant fuchsia hue.\nContinue to 9 of 16 below. 09 of 16 Ornamental Foliage Richard Felber/Photolibrary/Getty Images Plants with burgundy foliage fill in the gap between blooming cycles in your summer flower border. The fact that plants like 'Purple Emperor' sedum also produce flowers is a big bonus. Other handsome burgundy-leaved flowers to try in the sunny border include hardy hibiscus 'Summer Storm' and calico aster 'Prince.'\nFor even greater impact, pair burgundy foliage plants with chartreuse companions. Coneflower 'Coconut Lime' bears brilliant green flowers in zones 5-9, while spiderwort ...

Repetition is pleasing to the eye, and makes you look like a garden pro . In addition, sticking to a simple color palette of pinks and purples reduces visual overload. Far from being boring, this garden relies on a few pops of chartreuse in the form of evergreens for contrast.\nDepending on your region, you can look to the bright golden-green ...

Some knowledge and effort is required to grow these plants, but the payout is worth it. Soil should be moist, but well-drained. A sunny, sheltered spot in the garden is ideal, as high winds cause these tall stems to snap. An hour devoted to staking your tall lilies is essential for these top heavy flowers, as the blooming time always seems to coincide with spring storms. Single stakes are better than grow-through ...

All of these flowers can thrive in harmony in areas with mild summers with average to low humidity.\nA South African native, red hot poker likes well-drained soil in a sunny location. Although drainage is important, it prefers rich garden loam to lean, sandy soils. Red hot poker resents transplanting, so give it a permanent site in the ... MORE garden.\nOriental poppies like 'Beauty of Livermere' are outstanding specimens in the late June garden, but you should expect the plants to go dormant when flowering is finished. The tall blooms of blue sage will provide coverage for the gap when the poppies have faded.\nContinue to 14 of 16 below. 14 of 16 Annuals and Edibles David Q. Cavagnaro/Photolibrary/Getty Images An annual border filled with capsicum 'variegata,' pink cosmos bipinnatus, yellow and red coreopsis tinctoria, and purple basil aptly demonstrates how effective a marriage of flowers, vegetables, and herbs is in the ornamental summer border. Nearly all veggies and herbs like a full day of sun, rich and humus-y soil, and regular moisture, so choose flowers with similar growing requirements. Classic flowers to liven up the vegetable garden include marigolds , zinnias , and sunflowers . These ...

Cavagnaro/Photolibrary/Getty Images The key to a successful pairing with an assertive plant like bee balm? Matching it up with similarly vigorous flowering plants, like lamb's ears and day lilies. Like any plant, the fine line that divides welcome volunteers and invasive thugs is the gardener's desire for more plants. In the spring, dig up new bee balm plants that have overgrown their bounds and share them with friends, or you can even put them in the compost bin without feeling guilty about it. Thinning bee balm plants ...

Shasta daisy is an easy plant for beginners, and rewards with four months of blooms that attract butterflies but deflect deer . Pink achillea varieties like 'Love Parade' and 'Wonderful Wampee' are every bit as drought tolerant and vigorous as the yellow yarrow varieties.\nKnautia ... MORE , also known as scabiosa, is a short-lived perennial but may self-seed. The pale blue spikes Culver's root may reach several feet in height, especially in moist soils with some afternoon shade.

It is almost impossible to kill a tree by pruning it. And most of the intimidating pruning takes place the first 3 years of an apple tree's life. Conquer that and you're 90% done.\nYou want to accomplish 2 things with maintenance pruning of your apple tree\nEncourage fruiting spurs Open the branches so that sunlight and air can ... MORE reach all the ripening fruit Most fruit trees grown in home gardens are spurring types. A spur is a short (3-5\") branch where the apple tree flowers and sets fruit. Pruning encourages the tree to grow more of these fruiting spurs by removing competing suckers and unproductive wood.\nContinue to 2 of 9 below. 02 of 09 Remove Any Wood that is Unproductive and Attracts Problems Apple Tree Pruning - Removing Dead and Diseased Wood. Marie Iannotti Start your pruning by removing any dead, damaged or diseased branches. \u200bThe dead wood will be dark or brittle, often with the bark falling away. Diseased wood is often a different color than the other branches. The branch here is damaged and the open wound is an invitation to insects and further disease. You can, and should, prune dead and injured wood at any time of the year.\nContinue to 3 of 9 below. 03 of 09 Pruning & Removing Suckers from Apple Tree Branches How to Prune Apple Trees - Removing Suckers and Water Sprouts. Marie Iannotti We prune plants to encourage more growth, but not all growth is welcome. Suckers (branches growing from the base of the tree), whorls (branches that grow from and encircle another branch) and water sprouts (thin branches that usually grow straight upright) are never going to bear fruit . They just sap energy from the plant. Removing them early in pruning will also help you see the structure of your tree and make it easier to see where further cuts are necessary.\nContinue to 4 of 9 below. 04 of 09 Pruning Low Branches Pruning Apple Trees - Removing Low Branches. Marie Iannotti Get rid of any branches within about 4' of the ground. They'll probably be too shaded to produce any apples and they'll just invite animals to nibble.\nContinue to 5 of 9 below. 05 of 09 Pruning Out Future Problems Pruning Apple Trees - Downward Facing Branches. Marie Iannotti Prune out any downward facing branches. They too will be shaded and won't be productive. Next, focus on removing any branches that cross or rub against larger branches. As these grow, they will get thicker and heavier. Get rid of them now before they do damage to the branches you need in your scaffold. (FYI - The green rope is being used to bend down another branch.)\nContinue to 6 of 9 below. 06 of 09 Keeping Your Apple Tree Pruned to One Main Leader Apple Tree Pruning - Competing Leaders. Marie Iannotti Step back and view the tree again. It should have one main leader or central trunk. On the tree here, the leader is a bit curved, from not being staked and bending in the wind. This is OK, but the side branches on the leader will have to go. They were left there when they were young and thin, but now they are becoming competing branches and will distort the shape and openness of the tree. Prune them back.\nContinue to 7 of 9 below. 07 of 09 Outward Facing Bud Photo Marie Iannotti. Pruning Apple Trees - Outward Facing Bud When you are pruning out an entire branch, you can cut back to the collar of the branch, slightly away from the trunk. Just follow the ring of the collar.\nHowever, when you are only partially pruning the branch, you'll want to try and prune to an outward facing bud. In the photo above, you can see that the outward bud is directed away from the neighboring branch. Cutting just above this bud will encourage it to sprout a new branch that will grow out, away from the other existing branch. If ... MORE you were to cut above the inward facing branch, you would be encouraging a new branch that would cross and/or shade the existing inner branch and would eventually have to be removed.\nContinue to 8 of 9 below. 08 of 09 Clearing the Clutter How to Prune Apple Trees - Thinning Cuts. Marie Iannotti Now you can focus on thinning interior branches so that sunlight can reach all the fruits and each branch sits at a nice, strong angle of greater than 45 degrees from the leader. Be as ruthless as possible, without removing more than about 1/3 of the branches. Remove all spindly growth. Remember, all of this pruning is going to result in new growth, so the more you get rid of here, the less you'll have to deal with later.\nContinue to 9 of 9 below. 09 of 09 Here's What You're Aiming For The Final Effect. Marie Iannotti Finally, make sure that upper branches are shorter than the lower branches. Your final result should look like a pyramid with well spaced horizontal branches. The old adage tells us a bird should be able to fly through your apple tree without its wings touching a branch.\nIt may look extreme when you've finished, but your tree will bear healthier fruit and be easier to harvest as a result of these efforts.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://fthmb.tqn.com/kum6JiIWbfiu4kqxfgR5EBcJTPQ=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/DownwardFacing-56a346655f9b58b7d0d1394e.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/mK6N8qfjXcss2PWg4uqxEOS0wXI=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/Suckers-56a346683df78cf7727ca4f5.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/MtFN0r-0FsSX8OupFk1nF4WSXa8=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/Diseased-56a346645f9b58b7d0d1394b.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/-xBGU8j2-yHmXVxvSlVT23obe2s=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/FruitingSpurs6-56a346665f9b58b7d0d13953.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/LbWARbUakr5jurYumkYpPtrvdr4=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/CompeteingLeader_ed-56a346643df78cf7727ca4ef.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/s7t99OHdXAw-KnJJGF0p7ErFlzk=/735x0/Diseased-56a346645f9b58b7d0d1394b.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/QPCzAob088khgeHpvZyMV68BZyE=/735x0/FruitingSpurs6-56a346665f9b58b7d0d13953.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/tyczak5D66dDbg4OC2LB0zutV7g=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/OutwardBud-56a346685f9b58b7d0d13956.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/qpI4wp7iAwTh166iKlWnqWvEWE8=/735x0/Suckers-56a346683df78cf7727ca4f5.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/F3ZfRXV21K4vsH2m3XKSYwuXl_4=/735x0/ThinInside_ed-56a346683df78cf7727ca4f8.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/umATPIKoJVfsBRuY24Kgv3WPCAo=/735x0/LowBranches_ed-56a3454f5f9b58b7d0d13258.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/FtvkLouEoNQ44-_qsBMA2gTubMM=/735x0/Pruned_Apple-56a345425f9b58b7d0d13229.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/Cniy5oCmlvBPURQozGdtFHx4Heg=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/ThinInside_ed-56a346683df78cf7727ca4f8.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/pS7_qcNuh1_8UJkmHjjWvZFryqA=/735x0/OutwardBud-56a346685f9b58b7d0d13956.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/Pwd476NmsKhzWyor1Epmxqkez5s=/735x0/DownwardFacing-56a346655f9b58b7d0d1394e.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/zIukxgBozlplby0_16XC3HtWAxU=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/LowBranches_ed-56a3454f5f9b58b7d0d13258.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/wGh6zQG1N6s_DmAllqi7kEkWsO0=/735x0/CompeteingLeader_ed-56a346643df78cf7727ca4ef.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/cwv7B70xFATwMtQPJCwzl3LKg9A=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/Pruned_Apple-56a345425f9b58b7d0d13229.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:27:52.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "18a7b5488d94204df572bd1ed2c048e025eac8b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3JNABCGyqHJ9MjOF7McEA9p3EekjFps92OvLhjpc4ckUiMRrXLroYsbA--", "site_full": "www.thespruce.com", "site": "thespruce.com", "site_section": "https://www.thespruce.com/trees-shrubs-basics-4127747", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Trees &amp; Shrubs: Getting Started", "title": "State Flowers Photo Gallery", "title_full": "State Flowers Photo Gallery", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.208, "main_image": "https://fthmb.tqn.com/YPyafrLuutmGdWudR9y9ZyjrXRo=/500x500/filters:fill(auto,1)/CamelliaJaponicaFlickrNemosgreatuncle-57bbc3e05f9b58cdfdb29d4c.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "18a7b5488d94204df572bd1ed2c048e025eac8b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3JNABCGyqHJ9MjOF7McEA9p3EekjFps92OvLhjpc4ckUiMRrXLroYsbA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Vanessa Richins Myers", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "State Flowers Photo Gallery", "text": "01 of 55 Alabama State Flower, the Camellia Japonica Alabama State Flower, the Camellia Japonica.

dahlia varieties--almost all of them drop-dead gorgeous. They range in size from small to the gigantic, aptly named, \"dinner plate\" varieties. Dahlia blooms go from simple to almost psychedelic in color and form They make luxurious cut flowers and, depending on the size of the variety, can play the role of a thriller or filler plant in a mixed container. Most dahlias bloom from mid-summer through fall in most areas.\nDahlias grow well in pots, though you need to be ... MORE very careful not to let them dry out repeatedly. They also will need to be regularly fertilized during the growing season, and many will need to be staked so they don't fall over. It's also a good idea to put the taller varieties in heavy pots, so a stiff wind doesn't blow the whole thing over.\nYou can buy dahlia tubers online or in nurseries and some big box stores. Many nurseries also sell dahlias already started in containers.\nContinue to 2 of 5 below. 02 of 05 Planting Dahlia Tubers Gallery Leonardo, Dahlia. Kerry Michaels If you live in a colder climate and want your dahlias to bloom earlier, you can plant them indoors about 6 weeks before the last frost. However, if you do plant them inside, it's a good idea to use supplemental lights, once the plant breaks through to the surface of your soil. For lighting, you can either use shop lights fitted with one cool and one warm florescent bulb, or special \"grow lights.\"\nIf you are starting your dahlias in pots outside, wait until all danger of frost has passed or make ... MORE sure you can move your pot inside if frost is predicted.\nFor most dahlias you want a fairly large pot, though it doesn't need to be very deep. Many varieties would do well in a 12 to 14 inch diameter pot which is also at least 12 inches deep. Also make sure the pot has good drainage, because the tubers will rot if left to sit in water. I usually cover drainage holes with plastic window screening, coffee filters, paper towel, or if I have a n extra-large pot, I use a product called \"Better than Rocks,\" which lightens the pot as well as improves drainage and allows aeration of the roots.\nChoose a good all-purpose, fast-draining potting mix and stir in a slow-release fertilizer, following the label for directions on quantity. Dahlia tubers can be a bit unwieldy and large so, unless you are going to separate them, you will need to be careful when you plant them in your container. You want to make sure that the potting mix surrounds all the parts of the tuber, without leaving any air pockets and that they top of the plant is pointing up (look for eyes, like you would find on a potato or where they stem used to come out of the bunch). I usually mound a few inches of potting soil on the bottom of the pot, forming a little bit of a hill and balance the tuber on the mound. I then carefully fill in around the tuber with potting soil, firming it around the tubers, but gently so they don't break off.\nSome people recommend layering the soil and slowly filling up the pot as the plant grows. I've never tried this, but here are directions from the American Dahlia Society .\nContinue to 3 of 5 below. 03 of 05 Caring for Your Dahlias Kerry Michaels Dahlias like full sun , though don't like to get searingly hot. If you live in a warm climate or your pot is in a hot spot (in a corner or on concrete where the surface gets hot) move your pot into a shady spot in the heat of the day.\nKeep the soil moist, but not wet. Most dahlias will have to be staked so they don't fall over. Also, depending on the depth of your pot, a single stake might not do the trick of holding up the plant either--particularly in a stiff breeze. You can make a teepee ... MORE out of bamboo or for a fuller plant, pinch back the plant. Also, for more flowers, deadhead regularly.\nDahlias come in a huge range of flower size as well as plant size. If you are looking for enormous flowers, look for \"dinner plate\" dahlias. If you are looking for shorter plants look for miniatures, or \"low growing\" dahlias.\nContinue to 4 of 5 below. 04 of 05 Overwintering Dahlias Kerry Michaels Because I live in a cold climate, to overwinter dahlias, I wait until after a couple of frosts. I then cut off the dead foliage a few inches about the soil and let the pot dry out in my garage. I then carefully dig up the tubers and brush off all the extra dirt. I put them in a cardboard box and store them in the basement. If I have the space, sometimes I just store them potted up.\nContinue to 5 of 5 below. 05 of 05 Buying Dahlias Already in Pots Kerry Michaels Good nurseries often sell dahlias already potted up.

You can spend almost anything on a pot or nothing at all. From hand-crafted, Italian terracotta to a tin can--whatever your budget, there is a container for you. However, there are distinct advantages and disadvantages to every container. Here are the upsides and downsides of some common and not so common materials for containers and suggestions on how to minimize those downsides.\nI love terracotta pots. There is something about the ... MORE color that is neutral and warm that makes almost any plant look great. The range of quality and cost of terracotta pots is huge--from super cheap to phenomenally expensive. There is a line of Italian terracotta that is exquisite, durable and frost proof.\u200b\nMost inexpensive terracotta is delicate and will not survive repeated freezing and thawing. Another disadvantage is that if your terracotta pot is not lined or sealed on the inside, once filled with potting soil, it can dry out quite quickly. Some pots are glazed on the inside and this (look for a shiny finish) which can make the pot less prone to drying and more durable.\nI line my inexpensive terracotta pots with heavy plastic, with a hole cut in the bottom for drainage. I also sometimes use the terracotta as a cachepot by finding an inexpensive plastic pot that will fit inside the terracotta pot so that it isn't seen. If it's not a perfect fit, I sometimes can hide the plastic edge with moss.\nSuggestions:\nIf you live in a cold climate, unless they are rated as frostproof (most are not) store your terracotta indoors. You can leave them outside if empty them and protect them from moisture.\nStack terracotta pots in graduated sizes for a great looking planter and to maximize vertical growing space.\nContinue to 2 of 7 below. 02 of 07 Wooden Containers Maria Desantis/EyeEm/Getty Images Wood container can be gorgeous and can go from super modern to very traditional in design. The advantages of wood planters are many. If you need a custom size container to fit a specific area or need to match a color, wood may be the least expensive and easiest choice.\nA wooden container can last for years--depending on the type of wood, how it's constructed and where it's placed. However, many wood containers will only last a season or two, given a harsh environment and if the moist soil ... MORE is in contact with the wood. Cedar is a long lasting though relatively expensive wood; teak will also last. Pine is inexpensive but will not last as long.\nIt is relatively easy to construct a wood container. While choosing your hardware make sure to remember everything will get moist, so use hardware that won't easily rust.\nThere are also lots of inexpensive wood containers. Wine boxes make lovely containers as do wooden boxes found at yard sales and flea markets. Even wooden dressers can make great container gardens. Either use the drawers separately or keep them in the dresser and pull them out in a graduated pattern (the lowest drawer out the farthest, the top drawer out pulled out the least) to make a large vertical garden.\nSuggestions:\nLine your wooden containers with heavy plastic to make them last longer. I use heavy duty plastic bags with holes cut in the bottom for drainage and line the inside of the entire container with the plastic which I then fill with potting soil and plant up. I then cut off the top of the plastic bag and tuck in the edges under the soil. Painting wooden containers bright colors is a great way to add color or a focal point to your patio, yard or garden. Buy old wooden crates at yard sales or flea markets Be cautious of old painted wood as the paint may contain lead which is very hard to get rid of and dangerous To help your wooden container last longer, use pot feet to elevate it, so it's not sitting right on the ground or patio Continue to 3 of 7 below. 03 of 07 Metal Planters Westend61/Creative RF/Getty Images Metal containers can look fabulous. From giant feed troughs and brushed modern steel boxes to tin cans there are any number of looks and styles of metal containers. I have even seen re-purposed file cabinets become cool containers. Painted, brushed or shiny metal can rock. However, the key disadvantage is that metal can get searingly hot--too hot it can burn your plants and dry our your soil in a nanosecond.\nThere are a couple of ways to get around this problem. My favorite method is to place ... MORE metal containers in shady locations. This has two advantages, one is the heat, but the other is glare. I metal container in the sun can create a glare that is not only rough on plants, and it can be rough on your eyeballs. So if you put your metal container in a partially shady or full shade area, you don't have to worry about either.\nI also line my metal containers with bubble wrap to insulate the soil and roots from hot metal. It works well and lasts the season. That said, I live in a climate where it very rarely gets above 90 \u00b0F. I can imagine in hot climates metal could get hot enough to melt the bubble wrap, so I would keep them in the shade. There are also some plants that are more finicky about heat and drought than others. If you have a metal container that is going to get hot, make sure to choose plants that can take the heat.\nI also often use metal containers as cachepots, using either fiber or plastic containers and setting them inside the metal container.\nTips for metal\nUse a can opener, or hammer in holes using an awl or large nail for drainage. The more holes, the better Go to a hardware or feed and farm store to find large and relatively inexpensive large containers Collect plant colanders, barbecues, pretty metal cans and other found or inexpensive metal containers If you have a metal mesh container, either line it with a plastic bag with holes cut for drainage or line it with moss, Continue to 4 of 7 below. 04 of 07 Plastic Plant Pots Jennifer Daniels/EyeEm/Getty Images Plastic pots have come a long way. Some are absolutely gorgeous, and high end-some are cheap and ugly, and others are simply functional.\nPlastic pots are lightweight and can be any shape and style. Ranging from modern to the traditional, they can even mimic stone, concrete, and terracotta. They can have patterns, be matte, shiny and any color. However, be cautious of cheap pots, because after sitting in the sun the color can fade and brittle plastic can easily crack.\nAnother caution is using ... MORE plastic for growing edibles. There are some studies that show that some plastics can leach chemicals into the soil, particularly if left in the sun. I look for food grade plastics for growing edibles. Many planters designed for edibles are made of stable plastic that won't leach such as Earthboxes and Grow Boxes.\nI also use plastic containers as liners for terracotta and metal containers.\nLechuza Planter - the Ferrari of plastic planters.\nContinue to 5 of 7 below. 05 of 07 Fabric Pots M\u00f3nica Dur\u00e1n/EyeEm/Getty Images While planting in fabric pots may seem counterintuitive, plants seem to love them, and there are more and more on the market. My favorite is Smart Pots--breathable fabric pots that \"air prune\" plants so they don't become root bound . They are lightweight, incredibly durable and at the end of the season you simply hose them up, fold them up and put them away. They also come in multiple sizes. To jazz them up, I put them in colorful laundry baskets that I buy at discount or dollar store.\nI also am a ... MORE huge fan of using reusable grocery bags to grow plants. The ones I use are a cross between plastic and fabric. The plants also thrive in these. I have done edibles, herbs and decorative containers in these bags. Just make sure you use the plastic bags, I prefer the ones that have fabric on the insides. The reusable grocery bags completely made of fabric don't hold up for a whole season.\nHow To Make a Reusable Grocery Bag Herb Garden Video Instructions for How To Plant a Reusable Grocery Bag Continue to 6 of 7 below. 06 of 07 Concrete and Hypertufa Planters Anders Bundgaard/Moment Open/Getty Images Some of the most beautiful containers are made of concrete. The colors and shapes can be elegant and nuanced. The only drawback is weight--they can be ridiculously heavy. Hypertufa has some of the looks of concrete but is lighter.\nHypertufa is a lightweight concrete that is often done as a DIY project. You make a mud textured concrete and peat mixture which you then cast in molds. You can make textured pots by using a basket or even embed leaves, shells or other decorative items to create ... MORE patterns in the finished pots. I have never made hypertufa, but I have heard it is easy, inexpensive and the shapes you can make are limitless. It takes a few weeks to cure, so it is a good springtime project, so your pots will be ready for planting in the summer.\nConcrete and hypertufa are both incredibly durable and can be left outside even in the harshest climates.

Photo: \u00a9 Marie Iannotti Tomato seedlings are sensitive to cold air and soil temperatures, so we have to wait until things warm up, before getting them started outdoors. Of course, you'll want to harden them off first. But before you put them in the ground, the soil temperature should be above 60 F. I also like to wait until night time temps stay reliably above 50 F., although many sources say you can get a few degrees cooler.\nTomatoes are not difficult to grow. You can plop them in the ground, prop them up and off they ... MORE go. But if you'd like to give your tomato plants an edge, there's a quick trick you can do at planting time, to increase the number of roots they grow. More roots mean more water and nutrients being taken up by the plant, which should lead to a healthier, stronger plant.\nThe trick is burying part of the stem when you first transplant the seedling. Tomatoes have what are called adventitious roots - an appropriate term if you ask me. Adventitious roots do not form from the main root. They develop from the upper part of the plant, the stems, leaves or branches.\nIn the case of tomatoes, they form along the stem, mostly the lower stem. If you look closely, you'll see little bumps along the stem. These are the adventitious roots waiting to be formed.\nContinue to 2 of 4 below. 02 of 04 Planting Tomatoes Deeper than They Were in the Pot Burying the tomato stem will result in plentiful roots, all along the buried portion of the stem. Photo: \u00a9 Marie Iannotti Since we want to bury a portion of the tomato plant stem, we have 2 choices:\nWe can dig a deep hole We can dig a long trench and bury the stem sideways. The options are pretty straight forward. The advantage to digging a deep hole is that the roots will start off deeper, where the soil may be holding more water.\nThe advantages of burying the stem sideways are:\nIt's easier than digging a deep hole The soil is warmer, and the plant may initially grow faster. I tend to go the minimal digging route, and ... MORE I've had success. A 6 - 10-inch seedling works best. You are going to bury the plant up to the last few leaves, so dig a trench the appropriate size. If you have a 10-inch seedling and you want to bury it up to the last 3 inches, you'll need about a 7-inch trench. You can angle the trench slightly, root side angling down, but it's not necessary.\nRemove the seedling from its pot. Loosen the roots slightly, as you normally would. Gently lay the seedling down in the trench. Handle the stem carefully. It can always grow more leaves, but you don't want to snap the stem.\nContinue to 3 of 4 below. 03 of 04 Getting Your Tomato Plants Firmed In Be careful not to press too hard on top of the stem. Give it time to settle in. Photo: \u00a9 Marie Iannotti You don't need to remove the leaves that are on the part of the stem that will be buried. In fact, taking them off can risk injuring the stem. Just make the trench deep enough to accommodate them. Make sure you have a few inches resting on the soil, above the trench. Then go ahead and pull the soil over the stem and roots. Firm it in gently and water well.\nContinue to 4 of 4 below. 04 of 04 Getting Tomato Plants Established Sacrificing some height, when planting tomato plants, makes for a stronger plant. Photo: \u00a9 Marie Iannotti Don't worry if the top of your tomato plant seems to be laying down. It will reach for the sun quickly and be growing straight and tall. Now is the time to get your stake or cage in the soil. Be very careful not to drive it through the stem you just buried.\nYou don't need to feed the plant now if your soil has plenty of organic matter in it. If your soil is poor, you can amend it at planting time.\nAnd that's it. Stand back and watch your tomatoes take off. A word of caution, since this ... MORE planting technique encourages your tomato plants to send out lots of roots, they will be difficult to pull out of the soil, at the end of the season. Still, it's a small price to pay for healthy, productive tomatoes, don't you think?\nMore on growing and caring for tomato plants", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://fthmb.tqn.com/Fp6vO-5c0VUuWAa5wlAdNoNDuFE=/735x0/Trench-56a348d65f9b58b7d0d14876.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/RRsF8KxdtkLjEcUquBZqYrm6P5Y=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/Advantitious-Roots-56a348d63df78cf7727cb3f0.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/fJH584aUH1hZ9AAWUE14-rx_kf0=/735x0/Planting-Tomatoes-56a348d65f9b58b7d0d14879.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/kFgF4tnrTXIIoLQ_T_8QL-GAhMg=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/BUry-56a348d65f9b58b7d0d14873.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/piB4jLJPCUTOFpm356zxjEEX0Ts=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/Trench-56a348d65f9b58b7d0d14876.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/xYF8Ia1fQXj-7NNYIdCVnpZWkDY=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/Planting-Tomatoes-56a348d65f9b58b7d0d14879.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/EWf6Yt0rWODPQ1zYzIBU_ZqnHQI=/735x0/Advantitious-Roots-56a348d63df78cf7727cb3f0.jpg", "https://fthmb.tqn.com/gr2LQuG7fDzUogHBjX-biiaBAg8=/735x0/BUry-56a348d65f9b58b7d0d14873.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marie iannotti", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:42:18.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3f345f5bbbbf7dc67bafea7ab1aa07604967d412", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3JzEJ.GhCUH7rH2GlSUdWCPkvQZKTD.GC3rJFSbpH.UbgjWoNyLqShaw--", "site_full": "www.thespruce.com", "site": "thespruce.com", "site_section": "https://www.thespruce.com/weddings-4127584", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Weddings", "title": "Top 5 Wedding Gift Ideas", "title_full": "Top 5 Wedding Gift Ideas", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "https://fthmb.tqn.com/RRrQK_qJbEp2KiBkE-Bas0CZcJ4=/2122x1415/filters:fill(auto,1)/83869634-56b828e43df78c0b136500f5.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3f345f5bbbbf7dc67bafea7ab1aa07604967d412", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqzVb2BVMiN3JzEJ.GhCUH7rH2GlSUdWCPkvQZKTD.GC3rJFSbpH.UbgjWoNyLqShaw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "anonymous", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Top 5 Wedding Gift Ideas", "text": "(Tooga/Digital Vision/Getty Images) You're invited to a wedding\u2014what should you get the happy couple? Consider one of these top wedding gift ideas. These recommendations can be tailored to any couple's interests and are sure to make them smile.\n1. Money Yes, it's true; while it may seem impersonal or uncreative, money is my number one recommended wedding gift. Most young couples are saving for something big \u2013 a house, a car, a piece of furniture, or are still paying back their student loans.\nMoney may also help them have an extra-special honeymoon or let them order some extra photos for their album. While it's rude for a couple to ask for money, it is never rude to give cash. If you still want to give a personal wedding gift, combine the two: attach a check to a beautiful picture frame, a kitchen gadget, or a long letter detailing your wishes and advice for their marriage.\n2. An Expensive Item Off of Their Registry Often the more expensive items on a couple's registry are dream wedding gifts that they don't think they're actually going to get. Whether you're wealthy enough to buy such a wedding gift on your own, or you organize other guests to all chip in, you'll be making dreams come true. And yes, some couples do dream about owning high-end kitchen appliances or deluxe vacuum cleaners.\nCreate a registry on Amazon.com\n3. A Luxurious Hotel Room for Their First Night as a Married Couple Start their marriage off right by giving them a night to remember before they take off for their honeymoon.\nCheck with the bride's mother or the maid-of-honor to ensure reservations have not already been made, and give your gift early so that they'll be able to include it in their plans. If you know the couple well, be cheeky by printing out my top tips for wedding night success. In the event that the room is already taken care of, consider calling the hotel and arranging for a couple's massage or other relaxing spa treatment.\n4. A Wedding Gift to Stand the Test of Time Whether it's a bottle of scotch or fine wine with instructions to open on their tenth anniversary, a gorgeous vase, or piece of art, give a gift on which the couple will be able to look fondly and say \"Our friend John gave us that for our wedding.\"\n5. Make Their Honeymoon Extra Sweet If you've ever been to the place where the couple is honeymooning, use that knowledge to get them a gift certificate for your favorite local restaurant. You could also upgrade their plane tickets to first class, give them a camera to help them take great pictures, or give them some spending money tucked inside a guidebook of the area. If the couple is open to adventure, consider booking a day trip with a local tour group.

baskets that give them their universal appeal? Hanging flower baskets fall under the realm of container gardening , yet this gardening niche offers something more than most containers. Hanging baskets bring petite flowers to eye level, where they can be examined, smelled, and touched. Hanging baskets bring beauty to the otherwise dull real estate of walls and rafters. Hanging baskets focus on the plants, not the containers, and sometimes one can\u2019t be sure if a container ... MORE even exists under all of those trailing flowers.\nHanging baskets make flower gardening accessible even to those without a surface to place a flowerpot upon. Learn about flowers that thrive in mini hanging gardens, and plan a hanging basket design based on one of these blooming examples.\nContinue to 2 of 7 below. 02 of 07 The Cottage Garden Look With Hanging Baskets Photo: Stephen Shepherd/Getty Images There are small gardens , and then there are postage stamp sized gardens, and then there is the art of gardening without a garden. Hanging baskets can make this not only possible, but can deliver a traffic-stopping flower display to your entryway. If you\u2019re going for the traditional cottage garden look, include flowers that will thrive in hanging baskets, like petunias, lobelia, impatiens, million bells, pelargoniums, or begonias.\nContinue to 3 of 7 below. 03 of 07 Spring Flower Hanging Basket Photo: Josie Elias/Getty Images Spring has arrived, and you\u2019re hungry for flowers. Let the hanging basket satisfy your craving. In addition to springtime flowerbed favorites like the violas, primroses, pansies , and lobelia featured in this basket, consider growing spring-blooming bulbs like the daffodils shown here. Growing bulbs in baskets take a bit of extra planning, as the bulbs will need a pre-chilling period in the refrigerator to mimic winter\u2019s dormancy. After approximately 12 weeks of chilling, you can pot up the ... MORE prepped bulbs with your springtime annuals.\nContinue to 4 of 7 below. 04 of 07 Recycled and Repurposed Hanging Baskets Photo: Ming Tang-Evans/Getty Images Shabby Chic is all the rage, and the garden isn\u2019t exempt from the trend. Home gardeners can copy these trends by thinking outside the basket. Take special items from your basement or attic, and repurpose them as hanging baskets for the flower garden. No drainage? Poke holes with a cordless screwdriver. Too much drainage? Place a liner in the object, or put a small plastic pot inside. Other antique items waiting to host a flowering plant include lanterns, teapots, and watering cans, boots and ... MORE shoes, or tins and cans of imported foods.\nContinue to 5 of 7 below. 05 of 07 Hanging Basket Care Photo: Roger Smith/Getty Images Professionals have hanging basket design and cultivation down to a science, which allows them to charge a premium price for their vibrant creations. Can a beginning flower gardener replicate this success? Perhaps, by following these steps :\nStart with a high quality soil-free potting mix formula, which is a lightweight blend formulated for containers. Drench the basket liner with a fungicide if you\u2019ve been plagued with root rot or mildew in the past. Pack the planted basket with healthy plants in ... MORE bud; consider tried-and-true varieties from Proven Winners. Some of the plants shown here include lobelia, verbena , begonia , pelargonium, and moneywort. Fertilize continuously throughout the growing season; weekly dilute feedings are better than monthly full strength feedings. Pinch and shape your plants regularly to banish the straggly look. Don't cling to plants that still have one or two blooms, cut foliage back hard when more than half the blooms have dropped off the plants. Keep pests like aphids and whiteflies far away with yellow stick traps, insect soap, or pesticides like Marathon. Continue to 6 of 7 below. 06 of 07 Orchid Hanging Baskets Photo: Howard Rice/Getty Images Some of the best indoor hanging baskets feature orchids , like this cymbidium Sarah Jean \u2018Ice Cascade.\u2019 This orchid type is a good pick for beginners, as it is vigorous and free flowering . Expect a four-year-old plant to produce as many as ten flowering spikes over a period of three months. Keep the plant in cool dappled sunlight, and provide consistent moisture. Use a container designed for orchids, which need plenty of air circulation around their root systems to stay healthy.\nContinue to 7 of 7 below. 07 of 07 Red, White, and Blue Hanging Baskets Photo: L Alfonse/Getty Images One of the pleasures of gardening with hanging baskets is the ability to switch out baskets easily for seasonal displays. A red, white, and blue basket can grace your porch or patio on Memorial Day, Flag Day, Independence Day, and Constitution Day in most climates. Mild climate gardeners can keep the basket going through Veterans Day.

From the day your garden is planted, it will require maintenance to keep your flowers blooming and looking good all summer long. In the following pages, we'll take a look at some of the routine garden maintenance chores you should become familiar with.\nMost flowers benefit from having their spent flowers removed. This is called deadheading . Flowers that repeat bloom will often do so only if the old, dying flowers are removed. If they remain on the plant, they ... MORE will go to seed and stop producing flowers. Even many flowers that bloom only once per season benefit from deadheading, because the plant puts its energy into strengthening itself instead of producing seed. Some exceptions to this rule are plants like Astilbe or ornamental grasses , that bloom only once, but continue to look attractive with their drying seedheads.\nAbove is an example of a Centaurea montana that is having just its spent buds removed. Centaurea montana will set more buds along the stem, so the entire flowering stem is not removed until all the buds have bloomed and faded. A good pair of garden pruners will make a nice, clean cut.\nContinue to 2 of 9 below. 02 of 09 Garden Maintenance: Deadheading - Flowering Stem \u00a9 Marie Iannotti Sometimes it is best to just remove the spent flower bud when deadheading, as in the previous page with Centurea montana . However, when each flower is on its own stem, it is better to deadhead the entire flowering stem, rather than leaving a gangly, headless stem attached to the plant. Here a Scabiosa stem is being cut down to the base of the plant.\nContinue to 3 of 9 below. 03 of 09 Garden Maintenance: Pinching \u00a9 Marie Iannotti Some plants have very crisp, thin stems and can be deadheaded using you fingers. This type of deadheading is referred to as pinching. Coleus plants are grown for their foliage, not their flowers. Pinching the flowers off of coleus plants encourages the plants to become bushier and fuller. Other flowers that can be pinched include daylilies and salvias.\nMany fall blooming perennial flowers are pinched early in the season, to prevent the plants from becoming tall and floppy and to induce more ... MORE flower buds. Pinching plants like mums and asters will also move their bloom time back a few weeks, giving you flowers in late September, when the rest of your garden is dying down,rather than in late summer.\nTo pinch fall bloomers , start by removing up to 1/3 of the plant when it reaches about 6 inches tall. Repeat that process every 2-3 weeks, until the 4th of July. Then let the plant grow and set its flower buds.\nContinue to 4 of 9 below. 04 of 09 Garden Maintenance: Pinching versus Shearing \u00a9 Marie Iannotti Although threadleaf Coreopsis plants are suitable for deadheading by pinching, the quantity of buds and their close proximity to one another on the stem can make pinching coreopsis a nightmare. With plants like this, you are better off waiting until the majority of buds have bloomed and then shearing the entire plant back by 1/2 to 2/3s. It won't take long at all for the plant to regroup and set more buds.\nContinue to 5 of 9 below. 05 of 09 Garden Maintenance: Shearing \u00a9 Marie Iannotti It's not just plants with a vast amount of flowers to be deadheaded that make good candidates for shearing. Plants like catmint and perennial Geraniums tend to bloom all at once and then decline. Here catmint is being sheared back to a few inches. This will encourage the plant to set out new growth and new buds.\nContinue to 6 of 9 below. 06 of 09 Garden Maintenance: Foliage Dieback \u00a9 Marie Iannotti Some early bloomers simply get tired looking by the middle of summer. You will start to notice the older leaves, toward the outside of the plant, drooping and looking worn. This hardy Geranium was a full clump in spring, but now it has become an unattractive sprawler.\nContinue to 7 of 9 below. 07 of 09 Garden Maintenance: Basal Growth \u00a9 Marie Iannotti If you look closely at the early bloomers that have started to droop, you will probably see new growth at the base of the plant. This is called basal growth and it's a signal that the plant is ready to rejuvenate itself. The example here is a hardy Geranium. Other plants that will do this are fern leaf Dicentra and mallow.\nContinue to 8 of 9 below. 08 of 09 Garden Maintenance: Pruning to Rejuvenate \u00a9 Marie Iannotti When a plant's older leaves start to look worn, you should prune the foliage back either to where there is still fresh growth or all the way back to new basal growth, if there is any. Many new gardeners can't bear the idea of cutting back an entire plant, but this is tough love and your plants will thank you.\nContinue to 9 of 9 below. 09 of 09 Garden Maintenance: Cutting Back to Shape Plants \u00a9 Marie Iannotti Finally, there is a type of cutting back that has nothing to do with removing old flowers or leaves. Some plants, especially fall bloomers, will grow tall and gangly and not be able to support themselves.\nThis photo shows New England asters that are growing tall, but not filling out. Once these plants set flowers they will fall over. To encourage the plants to become stockier, cut the plant by 1/3, once it has reached about 6-8 inches in height. This will encourage it to send out more stems.\nLet ... MORE it grow about a month and then cut it back by 1/3 again. Now your plant should grow into a full, stocky plant with multiple stems and multiple blooms. The flowers may bloom a bit later than if you hadn't cut, but there will be more.\nWith a little regular pinching, deadheading, and pruning, your flower garden will be healthier, more lush, and will stay in bloom throughout the season. Another bonus is that the more time you spend up close to your plants, the greater the chance of you noticing any problems while there is still time to correct them.

Roses actually root rather easily. However most roses are grafted onto the rootstock of a different type of rose than the top, flowering portion, so the rose you root and grow may look nothing like the rose you started with.

It starts as a small growth near the soil line, on either the stem, ... MORE crown, or roots. Crown gall can easily be confused with the graft union, but the graft union will not keep getting larger. New crown galls are usually pale colored and somewhat round. As they enlarge they become rough, irregularly shaped, and hard. They may eventually start to rot, but they will return.\nControls\nThere is no cure. If you have an infected rose, dig it up and dispose of it somewhere other than the compost bin.\nCrown gall bacterium can over-winter in the plant and in the soil. It is spread to other plants by splashing water. Do not replant roses in that spot for at least 5 years.\nTips for avoiding crown gall:\nOnly purchase certified, disease free roses. Even then, inspect the base for unusual growths. Clean your pruners between cuts with a dilute bleach solution (1 part bleach to 4 parts water) or rubbing alcohol. Minimize wounds by using sharp pruners, control insect pests, and watching the mower and string trimmer.

If the flowers open, they will be full of ragged holes.\nControls\nRose curculios have a preference for yellow and white roses. Not ... MORE planting those colors will cut down on populations.\nHand picking is the preferred method of control. You can also gain some measure of control by removing existing buds, when you see rose curculios on your plants. The buds may have eggs inside them. And always dispose of any debris throughout and at the end of the season.\nIf you do have a severe problem with them, any broad spectrum insecticide should work.\nContinue to 10 of 11 below. 10 of 11 Rose and Pear Slugs Photo: James Solomon, USDA Forest Service, Bugwood.org Rose and pear slugs are two different insects and neither is a true slug. They are the lavae of sawflies, small flying insects. They look like slugs because they secrete a slimy substance that covers their bodies. Rose sawflies are yellowish-green and can get as large as 3/4 in. Pear slugs are a reflective greenish-black and a little smaller, at about \u00bd in. Although roses are not the preferred food of pear slugs, they will feed on a variety of plants.\nThere are 3 species of rose slugs to be aware ... MORE of. The European rose slug ( Endelomyia aethiops ) only produces 1 generation per year. The curled rose slug sawfly ( Allantus cinctus ), which curls up when not eating, usually produces 2 generations per year and the bristly rose slug sawfly ( Cladius difformis ) is covered in hair-like bristles and has the ability to up to 6 generations per year.\nSymptoms of Rose Slug Damage\nRose slugs feed on the leaves of rose bushes. They remove just the soft tissue, leaving the leaves looking translucent between the veins.\nControls\nA small infestation isn't worth worrying about. The damage is mainly cosmetic. However a large population can severely weaken the plant.\nStart scouting for the lavae in mid-spring. At this stage they can be hosed off with a good blast of water. Neem and insecticidal soap are also effective, but try and hold off on any insecticides, though, because sawfly slugs have lots of natural predators including: birds, parasitic wasps, and predatory beetles.\nContinue to 11 of 11 below. 11 of 11 Thrips on Roses Photo: Andrew Derksen, FDACS/DPI, Bugwood.org Thrips are a common insect pest. Flower thrips are slender and brown, with yellow wings that feed on flower buds. Chilli thrips, which are becoming an increasing problem in home gardens, are pale with dark wings. They feed on all parts of the plant.\nSymptoms of Thrip Damage to Roses\nFlower thrips will cause buds to distort. If the buds do open, you may also see brown streaks on the individual petals.\nChilli thrips cause damage to the buds, leaving them dried out and brittle. They also feed on the ... MORE leaves, causing them to curl upwards or distort.\nControls\nThrips are difficult to get under control because they live inside the rose buds and their populations can grow quickly. They can also over-winter in debris, so fall clean-up is essential.\nIf you start to see buds distorting, remove any buds showing symptoms.\nThere are natural predators such as pirate bugs and other beneficial insects, that can help in the battle.
