However, even systems that hold your hand as much as possible still make a few assumptions -- namely, that you already have a garden. After all, no budding gardener is really going to make a set of sensors their first purchase. More likely, they'll buy plants, dirt and a pot and then have no idea what to do next. The new Grow Duo offers something a lot less piecemeal: Drop your $200 on the company's site , and get a connected planter, soil and even the seeds. It's everything you need to jumpstart your gardening ambitions within minutes. Gallery: Grow connected planter | 13 Photos 13 +9 \nGrow wouldn't be the first connected gardening product that claims to sell you everything you need; last year the SproutsIO microgarden promised to sell you seeds and a pot that would let you grow your own herbs and vegetables hydroponically . But that's an indoor system, and it's also a lot more expensive. Grow is for people who have access to some kind of outdoor space like a roof, deck or small garden, and don't have the time or expertise to cultivate and manage it. I used to live in a house with flowers and a small vegetable garden and yes, it's a lot more work than dealing with some potted indoor plants. Temperature becomes a bigger concern, as does pest control. \nEach Grow Duo is a little over two feet wide, a foot deep and 16 inches tall. The plastic container is light enough to pick up and move around, even when it's filled with soil. Hopefully you won't have to shift the Duo around too often, though, given that it needs to be connected to a hose so the planter can water itself. But still, that flexibility will come in handy if you plant something that requires a bit more (or less) sun and needs to be relocated. \nA big part of Grow's system is being aware of things like light levels and temperature, and the Duo will monitor those along with the water levels and humidity. Thanks to the app it's also generally aware of the local climate so you won't try to grow something seasonally inappropriate. For example, in colder climes tomatoes should be grown as soon as possible after last frost, while root vegetables can endure at least two harvests. \nThe Grow app will feed you all this information, gathering the latest data from the planter via Bluetooth Low Energy. This keeps the power draw of the planter rather miniscule: Each Grow device is powered by two AA batteries, which last about a year. The planter will sync with your device every time you're in range. The downside is that you can't check on the planters from afar, like when you go on vacation. But Grow will at least make sure they're properly watered while you're gone, so you don't have to rely on flaky friends or relatives to keep an eye on your kale. \nWhile multiple units can be daisy-chained together for watering purposes, each Duo is a self-contained system when it comes to gathering data and monitoring its crops. The planters can accommodate the equivalent of two Grow seed packets at a time. Each packet contains a biodegradable sheet embedded with seeds, positioned according to how much space is needed for the grown plants. \nYou can mix and match different crops; the app will make suggestions on what to grow but ultimately it's your choice. The system will warn you when two crops are incompatible and shouldn't be planted together, as well as other advice throughout the season. The app also makes it easy to reorder soil and seeds from Grow as needed, though you always have the option of picking up your own materials as you become more comfortable with gardening. However, Grow would rather you use the soil sent with each planter since the watering system is designed with that proprietary mix in mind. As for the seed kits, they run between $6 and $20, while packets at your local Home Depot usually cost less than $3. You're definitely paying a premium for the convenience. \nThe seed kits span a range of edible greenery, from herbs and leafy greens for salad to more substantial fruits and vegetables like berries, cucumbers and eggplant. When there isn't enough time left in the season for a full crop to mature, Grow will offer seedlings give you a headstart The app will recommend the best plants for your particular climate but doesn't limit you to local produce: Grow CEO Idan Cohen mentioned there were certain greens from Israel that he missed and couldn't find in the United States. Grow plans to offer its customers a diverse selection of seeds, making them a lot easier to care for while still keeping your environment in mind. \nThe Grow Duo is available for pre-order now , with early bird buyers able to snag one for $199, discounted from the retail price of $249. That includes a $20 credit for buying your first few plant kits. If October seems a little late to start gardening, the Duo isn't actually set to begin shipping until January 2018, giving you plenty of time to get ready for spring.

Share Save \nWhen you think of easyJet, the first thing that comes to mind is budget travel. The airline has built its brand on no-frills flights and low pricing, but that doesn't exclude it from innovation. The company has been experimenting with new tech, from smart glasses that can detect dents in a fuselage to virtual reality cabins that can help train flight crews. For its latest demo, easyJet is thinking big: It wants to change the way we fly. Going green \nA large slice of easyJet's time is focused on reducing the impact its planes have on the environment. The global aviation industry produces around 2 percent of all human-induced CO2 emissions and is responsible for around 12 percent of emissions from all transport sources. easyJet is mindful of that and has begun implementing a new strategy that will \"progressively decarbonise and reduce noise from [its] aviation operations.\" \nThe first step is the introduction of two new Airbus A320 neo aircraft, which are capable of cutting CO2 emissions by 15 percent and noise output by 50 percent. Between now and August 2022, the company expects to add another 98 A320 planes, plus 30 A321 neo aircraft, which easyJet says offer the lowest operating costs in the single aisle aircraft category. \neasyJet can also play an active role in cutting emissions while on the ground. Typically, pilots use a plane's remaining fuel to taxi into a terminal and wait for a diesel-powered tug to position them in the correct spot. Now, easyJet will utilise a number of electric, towbarless aircraft tugs to service its fleet of 60 aircraft at London Gatwick airport. EasyJet's all-electric tug. Engadget \nIt's also teamed up with French aerospace giant Safran to trial a new e-taxi hydrogen fuel cell technology that ensures a plane's time spent moving on the ground produces zero emissions. easyJet estimates that around 4 percent of its total fuel is used when an aircraft is taxiing, so it could save as much as 55,000 tonnes of fuel (and the associated CO2 emissions) should the e-taxi system be applied across its 279-strong fleet. All electric \nElectric planes might be a long way off, but easyJet wants to be on the front foot when they do become a viable alternative to fuel-powered jets. The airline has partnered with US company Wright Electric to develop an all-electric aircraft capable of handling a large percentage of its short haul flights in the near future. \nRight now, easyJet is providing flight data and additional diagnostics to help Wright Electric build a plane that doesn't require jet fuel. The US startup -- founded last year by a group of engineers from NASA, Boeing and Cessna -- has already crafted a two-seater prototype and believes it can build a fully electric plane within the next decade. \nThe proposed Wright Electric plane suits easyJet because the ideal range is 540 kilometres/335 miles and it accommodate up to 120 passengers. That would cover 20 percent (or one in five) of seats flown by the airline today. Belfast to London, Bristol to Edinburgh, London to Amsterdam, Berlin to Vienna and Geneva to Paris are just a few of the routes that would benefit from a battery-powered plane. \nThe concept, shown below, operates in a similar way to an electric car. Batteries are laid in the hull of the aircraft and power motors inside the wing, instead of below it. This results in reduced drag and higher efficiency (plus it looks cool). A prototype of a proposed Wright Electric easyJet plane. Engadget \n\"For the first time in my career I can envisage a future without jet fuel and we are excited to be part of it,\" said Carolyn McCall, easyJet's chief executive. \"It is now more a matter of when, not if, a short-haul electric plane will fly.\" \nAccording to CEO Jeff Engler, Wright Electric is still weighing up which battery tech it will use to power its aircraft but claimed that its planes will be 50 percent quieter and 10 percent cheaper for airlines to buy and operate. easyJet says this saving will then be passed on to passengers. In-flight entertainment \nTypically, easyJet flights are boring affairs. The airline specialises in short haul flights, so it's not seen fit to include entertainment in the ticket price. However, that's all set to change with the introduction of Air Time , a new free app that lets passengers stream movies, TV shows, audiobooks and games via their own device. \nThe service works by asking passengers to connect to easyJet's inter-aircraft wireless network. Once connected, they can access a range of pre-selected video, audio and magazine content that can be played back via the browser. \nThe company will initially trial the app -- developed in cooperation with internet service giant Rakuten and inflight network specialists Immfly -- on five planes operating out Switzerland from this autumn . That doesn't mean that Brits will miss out, as the selected aircraft will continue on their scheduled routes to and from the UK. Staying safe \neasyJet has been trialling drones for a number of years in the hope they'll speed up aircraft ground checks and enable the airline to get its planes back in the air quicker. To begin with, the airline's oversized UAVs needed a human operator, but aircraft surveys have now been automated. Checks that would normally take more than a day can be completed in a matter of hours and with more accuracy. Engadget \nAs well as autonomous drones, easyJet is working with Blue Bear and Createc on 3D scanners that can check for dents and provide a more accurate damage assessment of its aircraft. Big-winged pieces of metal in the sky travelling at 600 miles-per-hour often come into contact with birds and other debris that could ground an aircraft if undetected. easyJet hopes that by automating checks and putting trust in 3D-scanning technology, it can keep passengers safer and reduce the amount of time needed getting its aircraft back in the air.

Nura and its semi-eponymous Nuraphones ($399) aim to be more like prescription specs for your ears, by analyzing your hearing and creating a bespoke audio profile. It's an interesting idea, and an even more interesting design.\nThe Nuraphones determine your personal hearing profile by listening to \"otoacoustic emissions\" -- sounds emitted by the inner ear when stimulated -- with a tiny microphone. These emissions reveal a lot of info about our hearing, enough that Nura believes can be deciphered into a sort of hearing \"fingerprint.\" Nura takes this fingerprint and uses it to adjust the audio signal from the headphones. The end result is a bit like a personal EQ setting, without all the guesswork, designed to make music sound like the artist intended (rather than amplify arbitrary frequencies).\nIt's a tantalizing prospect: Corrective headphones that know the quirks and failings of your beleaguered ears. When we wrote about them last year , I'll admit I was skeptical. Pretty much every headphone pitch I have ever had (and that is many) has espoused the virtues of its revolutionary audio, be it custom drivers, magical sound engines, dynamic doo-dahs or cutting-edge EQ algorithms and so on. But none of that helps if you're not able to hear all of those sounds and frequencies equally.\nSetting up the Nuraphones is a bit more involved than most other headphones (in that there's even a setup process at all), but it's simple. Using the companion app (iOS/Android), you are first guided to make sure you have the headphones placed on your head correctly. Nuraphones have an unusual configuration that we'll get into later, but this makes it important to have them on just right during setup.\nOnce you have them on properly, the app plays some audio that sounds a bit like a futuristic fax machine. This doesn't last long, but it soon moves onto the next stage of configuration, which takes a little longer. All in all, it takes about a minute. Once complete, you can save your profile and forget about it if you wish.\nNaturally, the first thing I wanted to know was how it sounded without the custom profile. Fortunately, this is easy to do in the app, as there's a switch to toggle between generic and custom audio. I'll be honest, the difference was incredible. In the generic setting, the audio sounded actually pretty bad. But once I put on the custom profile, the music sprang to life.\nThe first thing you notice is that the music is louder. This alone -- a simple bump in volume -- is often enough to \"trick\" the brain into thinking something sounds better. (There's an old DJ trick of casually lowering the volume on the previous DJ's last record so that your first one invokes the same feeling.) I could tell straight away though that there was more going on here. The music didn't just sound louder, it sounded more \"complete.\" All the different frequencies in the music felt balanced and natural, and not \"juiced.\"\nAfter listening to a number of different tracks in different styles, I was actually somewhat excited. There's an intangible, magical feeling you get when listening to well-recorded audio on a high-end system . This isn't quite the feeling I had here, but it was similar. A sense that music feels alive -- clearer, almost.\nThe Nuraphones have a few other features that help the music along, too. While they look like over-ear headphones, each cup has a protruding \"stalk\" that goes inside your ear. Both the outer section and in-ear part provide passive noise canceling, so the effect is doubled. In a room with people talking right in front of me (and no music playing), I couldn't hear a thing.\nThe second trick that Nura added, is tactile bass. Inside the on-ear part are transponders that respond to low frequencies (bass) with vibrations. It's not just an on/off vibrate, it's responsive to the frequency. Similar to how SubPac or Basslet work. The idea is that you \"feel\" the bass while the in-ear part focuses on the midrange and upward. It works very well (trust me), and I'd love to see this option in more headphones. If you're wondering, you can disable the \"immersion\" feature (as Nura calls it) or, conversely, go wild, and jack it right up to face-melting levels.\nBy now, you can't help but have noticed that these are no regular headphones. The design alone will tell you that. When I first saw the two in-ear drivers poking out of the cups, I didn't know what to make of them. Each stalk is spring-loaded, so it doesn't poke you in the side of the head (or push into your ear too hard). The spring is cleverly engineered so it retracts/extends slowly. The upshot is that sometimes you adjust the headphones and then feel the tip of the stalk slowly worm its way into your ear canal. You might also have noticed these stalks are... mildly \"anatomical\" looking. It's a little weird, but not unpleasant.\nI did find myself having to readjust the Nuraphones a fair amount. Not constantly, but maybe two or three times an hour I'd find myself reaching for either side just to get it in a slightly sweeter spot. The earbud stalks aren't uncomfortable, but it's more about making sure you have them inserted properly, so it becomes a bit of an unconscious twitch to be sure you have them set right.\nThe Nuraphones' weird earcups aside, the product experience as a whole is thoughtfully designed. The rubber sections that rest on the side of your head can detect when you're wearing them. This is, in fact, how you turn the Nuraphones on -- simply put them on your head. There are two touch-sensitive buttons \"hidden\" in the circular caps outside the strap (where you adjust the fit). These can be configured in the app to do whatever you want.\nThere's likely a compromise here, as you'll have to choose between skipping tracks, audio profile toggling, answering calls ... whatever the two things you need the most. I often want to pause or adjust the volume on the go, but obviously want to be able to answer calls too, without reaching for my phone.There's no button to activate Bluetooth mode, either. Anytime the headphones aren't connected, they default back to pairing mode.\nThis minimalist approach feels smart when it works. But if you need to toggle Bluetooth (as I sometimes did) or want to reboot the headphones (as I sometimes did), it's a bit of a guessing game -- setting them down for a bit and putting them back on. Likewise, occasionally I'd lift one earcup off to talk with a friend, and the headphones would turn off. They'd reconnect again in a few seconds, but it's a minor break in the experience.\nFor those who prefer a wired connection, you have plenty of options here. The Nuraphones come with a USB A cable for charging, but there are USB C, micro-USB, Lightning and 3.5mm audio cables available too (for an additional cost).\nDespite the minor quirks, the whole experience feels refined. Smart, even. And it'll likely only get better. A feature in beta is that the headphones can detect who's wearing them (if they have a profile set in the app). I tested this with my wife, and it works well -- telling me \"Welcome back, James\" every time I put them on. You also don't need the app once you've gone through the setup -- the settings are stored on the headset, so you can forget about it completely if you prefer.\nIf you're wondering, you can have up to three different profiles set in the app. It's also a good way to see how different your hearing is to someone else's. I tried my wife's profile, and it actually sounded pretty similar. Both mine and hers sounded pleasing, but mine did sound better (to me). I noticed higher frequencies were a little harsher in my partner's setting, and mids a little subdued.\nOn a more practical note, in wireless mode the Nuraphones last about 20 hours, which is decent. You can also use them with your PC without the 3.5mm cable. When you plug them in via USB, your computer should detect them as an audio output device, so you can easily charge them while listening at work. It's worth noting here that there's no LED, so without the app, it can be hard to know if they are fully charged.\nFor a debut product, the Nuraphones are impressive. The audio voodoo really does add a depth and a sense of clarity to music that almost makes you worry that you must otherwise be slogging through the world hearing the world only half as brightly as you could. The tactile bass adds another dimension (and means you need less volume), though your personal preference may vary with this one, and the slick design touches make this feel like a polished product.\nBut they also introduce a few minor compromises or design quirks that might take some getting used to. If you can live with relinquishing control over connectivity and power to the headphones, you've got little to worry about. At $399, the Nuraphones aren't the cheapest on the market, but they deliver an experience (and musical excitement) that's unique.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nura", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "james trew @itstrew  james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "aol", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": [{"name": "bay area", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nuraphones", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:37:20.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "082b5e08aae9989753899af1facbdd3a15ab0993", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSduuADMF1DcExTbo6Sj2Ceqvyk8GKwPEPNk4DvC9PhX9RtdTG0UlsjiEQiBrjav2NGu8XRfZe32tU.h1pRVgtozKWGa8vVA1o-", "site_full": "www.engadget.com", "site": "engadget.com", "site_section": "http://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Engadget RSS Feed", "title": "Amazon brings Alexa calling to the UK, Germany and Austria", "title_full": "Amazon brings Alexa calling to the UK, Germany and Austria", "published": "2017-10-03T14:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&amp;quality=80&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F5b1d149b7600acebf7152c92a2ad514%2F205729151%2Fechofeat.jpg&amp;client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&amp;signature=aa35268aacf816028c6b4e5831adc07750a15162", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 437, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 54, "comments": 0, "shares": 54}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 18}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "082b5e08aae9989753899af1facbdd3a15ab0993", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSduuADMF1DcExTbo6Sj2Ceqvyk8GKwPEPNk4DvC9PhX9RtdTG0UlsjiEQiBrjav2NGu8XRfZe32tU.h1pRVgtozKWGa8vVA1o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nick Summers", "published": "2017-10-03T14:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Amazon brings Alexa calling to the UK, Germany and Austria", "text": "The whole point of Amazon's Alexa is to talk, rather than type, to a virtual assistant.

In a piece talking about the Google spinoff's internal issues, the publication has revealed that it's gearing up to launch an autonomous ride-hailing fleet. The first self-driving vehicles in the service are even expected to start picking up passengers in Phoenix, Arizona, where Waymo has been testing its technologies, sometime this month. \nWaymo is apparently pushing through with those plans despite internal conflict between John Krafcik, the industry veteran Google hired in 2015 to lead its autonomous vehicle division, and its engineers. The company's tech personnel are reportedly unhappy about Krafcik's lack of technical knowledge about autonomous vehicles, which contributed to his decision to side with Alphabet head honchos Larry Page and Sergey Brin regarding unrealistic launch deadlines and hiring freezes. \nPage and Brin, for instance, wanted to launch an independent autonomous ride-hailing service with no human safety drivers back in 2016. Waymo's engineers knew it was a tall order, and they had to convince the management that a mixed fleet would be more realistic. Cars with human drivers could be used for longer drives or to go to destinations Waymo's cars haven't previously mapped. As a compromise, the company teamed up with Lyft with the intention of having its manned fleet operate under its partnership with the more established ride-hailing firm.

In August, cybersecurity firm IOActive claimed that Ubtech's Alpha series models did not encrypt the data they stored, making it easy for hackers to steal the info.

Save Bowers & Wilkins \nBower & Wilkins (B&W) is dropping its latest pair of premium wireless headphones. How are these \u00a3330 ($437) cans any different from the company's alternatives? The \"PX\" are the first to pack adaptive noise cancellation (which allows you to pick from three different modes through a companion app). The \"city\" option, for example, will let in traffic noise, so you're less likely to get hit by a car while jamming to Rage Against the Machine. And, there's the responsive interaction feature that auto-pauses your tunes when you remove the headphones. They'll even return to standby mode when you put them down (which should be a boon for battery life). \nThat's all well and good, but it's not enough to differentiate them from the other products out there. As far back as 2009, Sony had integrated a similar sensor into its MH907 earbuds , with the likes of Parrot's feature-packed Zik 2.0 over-ear headphones, and Apple's AirPods following suit. Plus, these days, everywhere you look an audio company is sneaking some sort of tech into its headphones. And, much of it is a lot more impressive than what B&W is offering (if that's your sort of thing). Throw a stone and you'll hit a pair of wireless earbuds that share your music. And, soon enough, voice-powered cans with integrated AI (like Bose's new QC35 headphones with Google Assistant built-in) could become much more common. \nBut, as B&W fans will attest, its brand has its own pulling power. Aside from the premium design, which is also present this time round, the sound quality of its devices tends to be top-notch . In the case of the PX headphones, the ability to manipulate the noise cancelling aspect (to block ambient car sounds, or let in chatter) is attention-grabbing. And, then there's the battery life: 22 hours of playback in wireless mode, and 33 hours when wired. Speaking of the design, the PX boasts a leather headband, and an etched-aluminum finish. You can grab them in either grey or gold starting today. Is that enough to make you part ways with 37 bucks more than what you'd pay for the (solid) B&W P5 wireless headphones?

Save Honda R&D \nThe disaster response team of the future could be made up of an army of cheery orange robots, according to Honda . The company has unveiled a working prototype of its E2-DR disaster response robot -- first revealed in an R&D paper in 2015 -- and it can do a lot. At 1.68 meters high and weighing in at 85 kilograms, E2-DR can walk, step over objects, climb stairs and ladders, slink through narrow spaces and traverse piles of debris. It can even tolerate rain for 20 straight minutes, which is more than a lot of actual people can. \nTo keep E2-DR's size and weight to a minimum, Honda swapped out traditional cables for rigorously-tested optical fibers. It's powered by a 1000-Wh lithium-ion battery which provides 90 minutes of juice, plus an Intel Core-i7 CPU, and is kept cool by air ducts and internal fans within its torso. All of its joints are fashioned in a labyrinth structure, keeping contaminants at bay. Its hands are equipped with cameras and 3D sensors, but they're only designed for basic gripping and to help it move around, as Honda envisions the robot interacting with the world via special tools and wireless communication. \nIn short, it's not a million miles away from the humanoid robots long promised by science fiction (apart from the intelligence aspect, of course. At this very early juncture E2-DR will be entirely teleoperated, but who knows what will happen in the future -- its predecessor Asimo already boasts a lot of autonomy ). Honda has stressed that E2-DR is just a prototype at the moment and that it has a lot of work to do before it can be useful.

However, the overall scale of the project is a closely guarded company secret, which means there are probably very big things in the works.

Now, the Pixel line itself is only a year old, but Google's smartphone ambitions have been part of the company's vision for over a decade now, and we felt that was worth celebrating ahead of Wednesday's big reveal. Join us as we take a look at Google's surprisingly long history in smartphones, starting with a device many of us had forgotten about completely. Sooner (2006\u20132007) \nGoogle had no way of knowing it at the time, but the roughly $50 million it shelled out to buy Palo Alto\u2013based Android Inc. would turn out to be one of the best deals in its history. Frustrated by the fragmentation of yesteryear's mobile industry, Google directed its new team to develop a smartphone of its own, running open-source software that would ensure Google's web services would have a place in people's pockets. Easier said than done. \nIn 2006, the team worked closely with HTC (a name that's going to pop up a lot) to build a prototype phone that looked a whole lot like a BlackBerry. Code-named \"Sooner,\" it had a four-way d-pad and a four-row physical keyboard that bubbled up from the phone's lower half. Given the competition back then, it was exactly what people would've expected a smartphone to look like, just with some of the utilitarian edges sanded down. BlackBerrys might have been meant to be all business, but the Sooner? It was more rounded, with a friendlier color palette -- pretty cute, I'd say. The 320x240 display wasn't a touchscreen, but the rest of it seemed pretty solid: it packed 64MB of RAM, a 1.3-megapixel camera and a pokey GPRS radio for data connections. \nT-Mobile eventually came on as a partner to help with testing the phone, but Steve Jobs' iPhone unveiling changed everything. Android co-founder Andy Rubin was reportedly in a car when the announcement happened, and the news caused him to (a) have his driver pull over and (b) rethink what the first Android phone would look like. HTC/T-Mobile G1 (2008) \nFlash-forward one year and Google's partnership with HTC and T-Mobile had finally come to fruition. The HTC Dream, known locally as T-Mobile's G1 , was the chunky, chinned smartphone that started it all. The Dream shipped with Android 1.0 at launch, and, while totally functional, it mostly served as a foundation for things to come. The notifications shade was a new paradigm for how to handle the inevitable influx of information on smartphones, and niceties like the ability to copy/paste and send MMS messages gave Google's software an edge over iOS. And deep integration with Google's services meant Gmail and YouTube devotees had no better choice than the G1. \nOf course, you didn't need to use Google's software for everything . The search giant's push for openness meant it paid a lot of attention to fostering developer support. The Android Market was up and running when the G1 launched (Apple's own App Store had only just gone live by then) and it included 50 apps you could download for free, mostly because Google hadn't cooked up a way to charge for them yet. \nActually interacting with the phone could seem a little strange, though. There was a 3.2-inch touchscreen for general navigation, but multitouch support was noticeably absent. In a nod to classic smartphones, it also had a trackball and a five-row QWERTY keyboard for bashing out texts and emails. Google would eventually bring a virtual keyboard to the Dream, and the update couldn't come soon enough for some: the physical keyboard featured deep-set keys that could be a little hard to use, and your hand had to reach over Dream's trademark chin to access it. \nThe Dream also featured a quartet of navigation keys -- there was one to launch the phone dialer, one to bring you back to the home screen, one to bring you back one level in whatever app you were using, and a call end key that doubled as a power button. Oh, and don't forget the Menu key -- it lived just below the screen and allowed quick access to your options. Throw in a dedicated button for the Dream's 3.15-megapixel camera and that's, well, a lot of buttons. \nWhile it was conceptually more convoluted than the iPhone's touch-and-go interface, it was easy enough to wrap one's head around. And it seemed far easier to use than other smartphone platforms available at the time -- I'm looking at you, Windows Mobile. More important, the Qualcomm-supplied chipset and 192MB of RAM kept things running at a reasonable pace, though it was pretty clear there was a long way left to go. Still, not everything was perfect: the Dream used a proprietary Mini-USB port for charging and audio rather than a headphone jack, and T-Mobile's 3G network was very limited. HTC Magic/Google Ion (2009) \nThe HTC Magic was yet another device with many names -- Google used a version of the phone it called the Ion as one of its development devices, and it launched in the US as T-Mobile's MyTouch 3G . It was essentially an upgraded Dream in a slightly sleeker body that ditched the physical keyboard. Screen size and resolution remained the same, but better parts meant a brighter, more colorful display. The camera stayed the same, too, which was kind of a disappointment. \nStill, the Magic made waves because it took the G1 package and shrunk it into a more pocketable, more attractive body. And despite all that shrinkage, the Magic actually had better longevity thanks to its larger battery. (Then again, just about every battery back then was user-replaceable, so many people just carried around spares.) The most notable addition to this second-generation device was Android 1.5 Cupcake , the first Google update to feature a delicious-sounding release name. The update had started hitting G1s just prior to the Magic's US launch as the MyTouch 3G, and it brought with it a bunch of bug fixes, lots of interface polish, support for stereo Bluetooth and that virtual keyboard. Kind of crucial for an all-touch phone, no?

After retiring in 2013 , Otellini revealed one major regret during his tenure: not working hard enough to get Intel's chips in the iPhone. Consequently, Intel mostly missed on the smartphone revolution. \n\"We are deeply saddened by Paul's passing,\" Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a statement. \"He was the relentless voice of the customer in a sea of engineers, and he taught us that we only win when we put the customer first.\" \nOtellini joined Intel in 1974 and served various roles throughout his career, including chief operating officer from 2003 to 2005. He would go on to spend almost 40 years at the company. He was an intriguing choice as CEO, since he was the company's first non-engineer to hold that role.

Share Save \nLast year when Uber was considering a purchase of newly founded self-driving truck company Otto, it commissioned a due diligence report that dove into the company, its assets, cofounders Anthony Levandowski, Lior Ron and Don Burnette and a few other employees that left Google for the startup. It became a hot item in the Waymo lawsuit against Uber and though Uber and Levandowski fought to keep the document out of Alphabet's hands, a judge ordered it to be turned over to Google's and Waymo's parent company by September 13th. Well that document has now been made publicly available , Recode reports, and some of its contents don't look great for Uber . \nThe report was put together by cybersecurity firm Stroz Friedberg which found that Levandowski had 50,000 work emails on his computer from when he was employed at Google. On his phone, he also had pictures of a Google car, technical diagrams and a LiDAR patent application. Waymo's LiDAR technology is the basis of the company's suit against Uber. The report also describes five disks that held proprietary Google information that Levandowski supposedly discovered in his possession and alerted Uber to. Travis Kalanick, Uber's CEO at the time, reportedly said he \"wanted nothing to do with the disks\" and Levandowski claims he had them destroyed. However, the Stroz Friedberg report notes some difficulty in confirming Levandowski's story. \nAside from Levandowski, Stroz Friedberg also found that cofounder Lior Rion possessed confidential images on his phone and had deleted files from his computer in the midst of its investigation as had Otto Chief Operating Engineer Colin Sebern. \nHowever, while this report highlights what sorts of proprietary information Otto employees may have taken with them after leaving Google -- as well as some shady behavior -- it doesn't prove that any of that information was ever used by Uber to develop its technology. And that's something Alphabet will need to demonstrate in order to win its case against Uber. \nLast month, after receiving this document, Alphabet requested the trial be delayed in light of new evidence that it needed to work through. The judge is supposed to decide today whether the October 10th start date will be pushed.

Save NASA NASA / Reuters \nThe 2017 winners of the Nobel Prize for Physics were announced today . One half of the prize will go to Ranier Weiss from MIT, while the other half is being awarded jointly to Barry C. Barish and Kip S. Thorne, both from Caltech. The three scientists worked on gravitational wave observation, collaborating between the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo, its European counterpart. The prize was awarded \"for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves,\" according to the Nobel Prize website. \nThe first confirmed detection of gravitational waves, caused by the collision of two black holes, occurred back in September of 2015. These ripples in spacetime were first predicted by Albert Einstein himself. Subsequent detections followed; the fourth, and most recent detection of gravitational waves occurred just last week. \"Gravitational waves contain information about their explosive origins and the nature of gravity that cannot be obtained from other astronomical signals,\" said France C\u00f3rdova, the director of the National Science Foundation . \"These observations have created the new field of gravitational wave astronomy.\" \nThe committee chose these three men because the \"2017 Nobel Laureates have, with their enthusiasm and determination, each been invaluable to the success of LIGO.\" Their hard work contributed to the project's success and ensured that the 40-year hunt for gravitational waves resulted in a successful detection. However, the good people over at Popular Science point out (and rightly so) that three men won the Nobel Prize in Physics for the hard work of over 1,000 people who worked on the project. They list the names of all the people who should be recognized for their contributions to the discovery of gravitational waves.

Save Seedling \nKids frequently don't need much more than their imagination to bring a teddy bear to life, but what if they had a little boost? That's what Seedling hopes to do with Parker. The teddy by itself is the same sort of fluffy companion you likely had as a child, but an augmented reality app for iOS turns the bear into something much more. If you want to play doctor, you can look at Parker's insides to cure a stomach bug or ease a sore throat. You can create magic forests and sea gardens using the AR camera. And importantly you're rewarded for being kind: the more you take care of Parker, the more the bear uses AR to 'transform' the world around you. \nParker is available now for $60 with all the accessories you need to get started (besides an iPhone or iPad), including an interactive toy thermometer. That's not a trivial amount for a stuffed toy, but Seedling is betting that the AR element will be worth it as it teaches empathy and problem solving in addition to whatever your young ones imagine. The catch? You'll have to visit an Apple store (online or retail) in \"select countries,\" and the use of ARKit for Parker's magic puts a damper on the possibility of Android support (or at least, ARCore support) in the immediate future. \nUpdate: While there was no mention of Android at first, the company tells us that an Android app should be available on October 4th -- it just won't take advantage of ARKit features, for obvious reasons.

Save Roberto Baldwin / Engadget \nThe earliest hyperloop routes might not be limited to wealthy tech havens like California or the UAE . Missouri officials and Hyperloop One are seriously exploring the possibility of a hyperloop route that would run between Kansas City and St. Louis. In theory, the pod-based system would shuttle you between the cities in under half an hour, instead of the nearly 4 hours it takes by car -- you could commute from one end of the state to the other for work. \nThere still needs to be a feasibility study that will cost about $1.5 million (thankfully, paid from private funds) before there's any construction. As far as hyperloop routes go, however, this is potentially ideal. Hyperloop One's Dan Katz observes that it would be an \"incredibly straight\" route, which is rather important for pods that can hit speeds of up to 760MPH. \nThis isn't the only other proposal in the middle of the US. Colorado is also considering possible links between Colorado Springs, Denver and (in Wyoming) Cheyenne.

Indeed, aside from Halo Recruit , Microsoft also announced that developers will finally be able to access the preview for Windows Mixed Reality SteamVR (which it announced over a month ago ) starting today. Consumers will get it this holiday season. \nAs a reminder, Microsoft is positioning Windows Mixed Reality as an all-inclusive concept that includes both augmented and virtual reality -- HoloLens is for AR, while the other Windows Mixed Reality headsets would be used for VR.

A succession of Reddit users have posted and reposted a photo that appears to show Tesla's semi truck sitting on a flatbed. And to no one's surprise, this isn't the Smokey and the Bandit -style truck of yore -- it's all swooping curves, complete with an expansive cockpit window. You can also see the vehicle's detached fairing off to the left. \nThe exact feature set of the truck is still somewhat mysterious, but there have been clues. It's expected to have a range of between 200 to 300 miles , so it'll be focused more on short hops than across-country hauls. And it's no surprise that Elon Musk likes the idea of autonomous trucks , so it's reasonable to see a more truck-oriented take on Autopilot that might include platooning when there's a multi-truck convoy. \nThe one thing for certain is that Tesla will have competition: more established brands like Cummins have already unveiled their own electric semis .

As it turns out, Bandai, Bandai Namco , IBM and VAIO have joined forces to bring us a lifelike \"Gundam Concierge Haro\" aka \"Gansheruju Haro\" -- including a 19 cm-wide spherical body (pretty much the size featured in the original series), a variety of gentle movements (bobbing and spinning), glowing eyes and mouth, extendable arms and legs plus a pair of subtly flapping ears. Better yet, if you're fluent in Japanese, you'll be able to have Gundam-related conversations with Haro, courtesy of IBM's AI software. Gallery: Gundam Concierge Haro at CEATEC 2017 | 7 Photos 7 +3 \nAt the booth, the demonstrator asked Haro who would win in a battle: a Gundam or a Zaku? Haro replied with something along the lines of \"Gundam would beat Zaku.\" And if you tell Haro that you want to talk about Char Aznable, you may end up getting to the point where Haro tells you that \"Char's custom Zaku is three times faster than a [regular] Zaku\" -- a nod to the famous line in the original Gundam series. Better yet, if you dare, Haro can quiz you on your Gundam knowledge. You can also ask Haro for the time and date (smartphone setup via Bluetooth required), but that's as far as non-Gundam conversations go. Haro is the recurring mascot in the Gundam anime series. Next year, you'll be able to get a lifelike version of it. pic.twitter.com/OCHRIxcgwr \u2014 Engadget (@engadget) October 3, 2017 \nDon't expect Haro to be replacing Siri, Cortana nor Alexa any time soon, because Bandai actually wants this \"BN\u30fbBot Project\" to be as faithful to the anime version as possible. Even this Haro's cute voice is provided by voice actress Satomi Arai, who played the same character in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: A New Translation trilogy and the more recent Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin movie series. The only thing that's really missing on this Haro is the hovering capability (well, that only seems to work in low gravity in the anime, anyway), but that's unlikely going to stop the hardcore fans from buying one when it launches some time next year for an unknown price.

Somehow he ended up in London, where he had the golden opportunity to buy a then senior editor a pint of lager, and here we are. 491 Shares", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:37:15.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a8f6633150049680de63b5387321df0b3b153bbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSduuADMF1DcExTbo6Sj2Ceqvyk8GKwPENkQEmqvfHN.bxtalfFgO3GRJWkA9O1D3B6BZw2KoIdzg--", "site_full": "www.engadget.com", "site": "engadget.com", "site_section": "http://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Engadget RSS Feed", "title": "Google's mini Home speaker may ship on October 19th", "title_full": "Google's mini Home speaker may ship on October 19th", "published": "2017-10-03T21:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&amp;quality=80&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F295c8dfa0d4cf71d2f5038e5aabec8fe%2F205730516%2Fgoogle-home-mini-and-pixel-xl-2.jpg&amp;client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&amp;signature=021b26b5e9c402705f9130c03752f479f9825861", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 437, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 209, "comments": 0, "shares": 209}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 21}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a8f6633150049680de63b5387321df0b3b153bbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSduuADMF1DcExTbo6Sj2Ceqvyk8GKwPENkQEmqvfHN.bxtalfFgO3GRJWkA9O1D3B6BZw2KoIdzg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jon Fingas", "published": "2017-10-03T21:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google's mini Home speaker may ship on October 19th", "text": "Google's mini Home speaker may ship on October 19th You may even get it for as little as $24 if you buy it from Walmart. Save Google \nIf there was any doubt that Google's October 4th event will include a miniature Home speaker , Walmart just erased it. The big-box retailer briefly posted a listing for the Google Home Mini that not only shows off the puck-like Assistant device, but gives an idea of what to expect when it launches. The Mini will reportedly ship around October 19th for $49, and you might not even have to pay that much. You see, Walmart has an tie-in with Google Express that cuts $25 off the price of orders until January 15th. That means you could be paying as little as $24 -- not bad for a brand new alternative to the Echo Dot . \nAs you've no doubt noticed, Walmart's imagery also includes a render of the Pixel 2 XL, the larger of the two Android Oreo phones Google is expected to announce on the 4th. It doesn't reveal much that you don't already know (Evan Blass recently had a closer look ), but it's one more confirmation of the Pixel 2 XL's thin-bezel design and stereo speakers. \nThere's not much mystery to the Home Mini, that's for sure. Ultimately, it's a cut-down version of the Home that drops any pretense of being music-friendly in favor of a lower price and that compact profile. It could be joined by the Home Max , a high-end speaker that focuses much more on quality and might rival the Apple HomePod or Sonos' upcoming voice-guided speaker . Between the two Home models, it's clear that Google wants to take on the broader smart speaker market, not just carve out a niche for itself.

Save Snap \nIt's finally time for Snapchat's new augmented reality art project to be revealed. The feature, leaked yesterday via the hack of a web countdown clock on art.snapchat.com , puts artist Jeff Koos' signature giant balloon animal installations in several locations, including Champ de Mars, Paris, Central Park, New York, Hyde Park in London, Roundhouse Park in Toronto, Sydney Opera House, Millenium Park in Chicago, Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, National Mall in Washington DC and Venice Boardwalk in California. So far, it's just Koons' art that's available; there's a web form for other artists to submit their own work for consideration. The countdown ran down at 3PM ET today. \nThe art installation tool looks a lot like Snapchat's world lens technology, which brings animations into the real world via your smartphone camera, much like AR app Holo does. Snap has opened up the AR system to advertisers, as well, including Warner Bros. and Bud Light. If you're an artist, you can submit your own art for consideration. Clicking the Artists Welcome button on Snap's art page leads to a form to fill in with your name, email, link to your art portfolio, and a spot to tell them more about yourself. \nTo find Koons' artwork, you'll need to have the latest Snapchat app update and be within 300m of the Lens location. Tap the camera screen to bring up the Lens carousel and you should see the installation easily -- they're the equivalent of three stories tall. If you're a bit too far off, an on-screen guide will take you to the Lens. Sculptures will be available at each location for a couple of weeks, a Snap spokesperson told Engadget, and will travel to a new spot, which will show up on the art website , too.

Save Nigel Marple / Reuters \nKim Dotcom, the founder of illegal file-sharing site Megaupload, was arrested in 2012 by New Zealand authorities on behalf of the US. He still has not been extradited to the US, however. In April of this year, the file-sharing maven asked the US Supreme Court to overturn a 2014 ruling that let US authorities keep $75 million in assets seized during the original raid on his house. The petition was denied on October 2nd, which allows the seizure order to remain intact. \nThe assets in question are currently being reported as worth $40 million. They include bank accounts in Hong Kong and New Zealand, Dotcom's mansion home, luxury cars, jet skis, big-screen TVs, a $10,000 watch and an Olaf Mueller photograph said to be worth more than $100,000, according to Ars Technica . The reasoning behind the seizure is that Dotcom is a fugitive \u2014 he's never appeared in American court and therefore cannot claim the assets the US government kept.

Turn10 Studios / Microsoft \nBy Joel Stocksdale \nWe've got some good news and some bad news about Forza Motorsport 7 . First the good news: It's exactly the Forza game you were expecting. Next the bad news: It's exactly the Forza game you were expecting. This seventh entry in the series, and amazingly, the third example on Xbox One (each previous Xbox only saw two mainline Forza Motorsport releases), is very much an evolution of the games that preceded it, and that's both good and bad. Let's look at the good side of this coin. Firstly, Forza 7 is stunningly gorgeous. The tracks and environments seem to have received the most graphical attention. In addition to active backdrops with crowds, helicopters and other set pieces, there are other details that bring the locations to life. The most visually stunning we found in our brief time playing was on the Dubai circuit, which is one of the introductory courses when starting the campaign. As you're driving, you pass through sandy deserts where the wind is actively blowing sand onto the course, creating drifts, and you can see it all happening. Even on less drastically sandy tracks like Laguna Seca , you'll see light clouds of dust wafting across the track. \nThe weather is more varied and challenging, too. Rainy conditions return, along with standing water, which will seriously affect your traction and handling. But there are also unusual conditions like early morning fog, which we experienced in an early race at Hockenheim. The fog not only cut down on how far forward we could see, but it caused the light to diffuse everywhere, making it tough to see when driving toward the sun. \nThe cars themselves haven't been radically updated, compared with Horizon 3 and Motorsport 6 , but they still look beautiful, and every single vehicle's engine, interior, and trunk can be closely examined with Forzavista. But extra details have been added that bring you closer to actually driving these cars. For instance, many of the regular road cars' windshield wipers begin to wiggle and shimmy as speeds increase, showing the affect of wind on them. And as you may have seen in the trailers, the various bundles of wires and hoses in some race cars also vibrate as you're driving. \nThere isn't much change to the gameplay, either. The physics model is just as spot-on as any previous Forza Motorsport game. There are also plenty of driver assists and the signature \"Rewind\" function to aid less experienced and less skilled drivers play the game. Many, many race series are available in the campaign mode to complete, and you will be required to complete various series in order to move on to new and more challenging events. Races in the campaign can also now be lengthened or shortened depending on preferences. You could give yourself an extra challenge in trying to win with fewer laps, or lasting longer. Adding more laps could also give you more time to beat tougher opponents. And of course you have the option of participating in quick single races, split-screen multiplayer, online multiplayer, and special challenges if you get tired of the campaign. There is plenty to unlock and collect, too. There are over 700 of those beautiful aforementioned cars to collect and race. Interestingly, having enough credits isn't enough to buy each car in the game. Forza Motorsport 7 employs a system in which you must have collected enough cars to unlock a new tier of vehicle. This sounds like it could be frustrating, and we can attest that some of the cars locked away early on seem like they should be readily available. But the positive part of this is that this system forces you to spend a little more time with some fun slower cars you might have missed if you could just buy anything you want. It also prevents you from getting cars that are too powerful, too fast. There are loads of racing suits to pick from, too. They aren't all just different generic colors and styles either. There are both full racing suits and full-face helmets, as well as outfits with jeans, leather jacket, and open face helmets with goggles. There are a bunch of special novelty suits, too, ranging from disco-era tuxedos to The Dude 's sweater and shorts from \"The Big Lebowski.\" Unfortunately, all of these suits are awarded by random chance. You can get them by reaching new experience levels by completing races, or by purchasing prize crates, which can contain cars, suits, or mods which can be applied during races to earn extra cash and experience by performing racing feats. These are all the great things you would expect from a Forza Motorsport game. Now we should talk about the things that we expected \u2014 but aren't exactly glad they still showed up. First among them is the homologation system. Most every race series is based on a style of car, rather than a performance class, for example hot hatches. It's an idea that sounds cool, since you'll get to pit a bunch of the same style of car against each other to see which is best. But the problem is that those styles span a wide range of performance. In the hot hatch category is both the Hyundai Veloster Turbo , and previous generation Honda Civic Type R . Those cars aren't actually comparable in real life, let alone virtual, due in part to the roughly 100 horsepower difference between them. As a result, the only way Forza will let you use a car like the Veloster is if it's hopped up to compete. For the average player, this isn't too big a deal since the game can automatically upgrade the car to compete. But for somewhat nerdier players, which include many of us at the office, the system precludes the opportunity to race the car in stock form and experience how it feels and compares to similarly performing cars. Returning to the topic of cars, though the car list is substantial, there are quite a number of strange holes in various automakers' rosters. Looking at hot hatches once again, heavy hitters such as the Focus RS, Golf R, and Civic Type R all are present, some in multiple generations, but the Focus ST and any of the last three GTI generations are absent. And it's still impossible to ignore the lack of any production Toyotas in the game. Modifications are still lacking for many vehicles, too. When I went to modify a Mazdaspeed Miata, the only bodykit options were the generic Forza complement of tow hooks and canards. This is particularly frustrating when many more options were available on the same car in previous Forza Motorsport games. That said, more popular cars do still have plenty of visual modifications available, and every car has the same wide wheel selection and paint scheme editor. Finally, the reward system has really become convoluted, and those prize crates are the culprit. They're the only way to get items like custom racing suits, and they have to be purchased with credits you could've spent on upgrades and cars. And different boxes of different costs yield different random rewards. The more expensive, the better the chance at getting a rare item. But regardless, you'll mostly be getting more \"mods\" to use in races to earn more money and experience. This does help you advance and have the chance of earning a new suit, new car, or credit bonus, but you'll also probably just pour a lot of your credits back into more prize crates. It seems as though there could have been a simpler, more user-friendly system. But when you look at the overall package, even with some of our gripes, Forza Motorsport 7 is still a superb racing game. It has loads of cars, spectacular graphics, lots of ways to tweak the experience for yourself, and it's accessible to both newbies and veterans alike. It's exactly what you'd expect from the series.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tu", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "forzavista", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joel stocksdale", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "forza motorsport", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "focus st", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mazdaspeed miata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honda civic type r", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "motorsport", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "laguna seca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hockenheim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T23:16:27.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03a96465241706dda2efa5d961fffd09ce2115b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSduuADMF1DcExTbo6Sj2Ceqvyk8GKwPEMjFu32ky1unuzrZY3KKUTHuBtMDW__wOnY5E8a.pKQovELiwtzvn.wddu9jLm37pYkv8dYIwcVN1uZrhfHqXk8", "site_full": "www.engadget.com", "site": "engadget.com", "site_section": "http://www.tuaw.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Engadget RSS Feed", "title": "Walmart bought a shipping company for same-day deliveries in NYC", "title_full": "Walmart bought a shipping company for same-day deliveries in NYC", "published": "2017-10-03T23:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&amp;quality=80&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F564c4054308c02eda1b241b09d205ed9%2F205731440%2F90.jpeg&amp;client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&amp;signature=2dcc54dca72891b1350fe2cf8b3e0ea9c1cddac3", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 437, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 27, "comments": 0, "shares": 27}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 18}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03a96465241706dda2efa5d961fffd09ce2115b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSduuADMF1DcExTbo6Sj2Ceqvyk8GKwPEMjFu32ky1unuzrZY3KKUTHuBtMDW__wOnY5E8a.pKQovELiwtzvn.wddu9jLm37pYkv8dYIwcVN1uZrhfHqXk8", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mallory Locklear", "published": "2017-10-03T23:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Walmart bought a shipping company for same-day deliveries in NYC", "text": "Walmart bought a shipping company for same-day deliveries in NYC Parcel has been providing same-day delivery service in NYC for the last few years. Save Walmart \nProviding fast and, ideally, free delivery is a feature customers have come to expect from online retailers and it's one that Amazon does quite well. But in its ongoing battle with the retail giant, Walmart has acquired a startup that will allow it to offer same-day delivery in New York City. \nIn a blog post today, Walmart announced its purchase of Parcel -- an NYC-based same-day delivery service that allows customers to schedule deliveries within two-hour windows that are convenient for them. Parcel has been handling deliveries for companies like Chef'd and Martha & Marley Spoon and Walmart says it will continue to work with its existing clients. But Parcel will also begin handling same-day deliveries for both Walmart and Jet.com. Jet.com, which Walmart purchased last year, has been testing free same-day delivery for some items in NYC, but Parcel's infrastructure will allow the company to expand those offerings. \nWalmart has played with a few ideas when it comes to providing cost-effective ways to provide fast delivery. It offers grocery deliveries via Uber and Lyft in some regions. It's also began testing a service that recruits Walmart employees to deliver packages to customers on their way home. And recently, Walmart starting testing out an option that would give delivery drivers access to a customer's home so that groceries ordered online could be put in the fridge if the customer isn't home. \nNeither company revealed how much Walmart paid for Parcel, but a source told Recode that it was less than $10 million. While Parcel stands to boost Walmart's same-day delivery prowess in the New York City area, it still has hefty competition from Amazon which offers same-day and two-hour delivery in a number of regions.

That\u2019s it. That caused the 145-million person data leak. Save Kevin Lamarque / Reuters \nThe Equifax data breach that leaked information on the now -145 million people was caused by a vulnerability in Apache's Struts system. Trouble is, the software provider supplied a patch back in March that should have eliminated that vulnerability. But Equifax's former CEO (who suddenly retired last week) told the House Energy and Commerce Committee that a single IT technician was at fault for the whole thing after they failed to install the patch. \nWhile speaking to the committee (video below), former CEO Richard Smith outlined the company's normal procedure for new patches: Have a technician install it and then scan the system for any remaining vulnerabilities. Apparently, both the human and computer steps failed. \nAs Smith outlines in his written testimony (PDF), the Department of Homeland Security's Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) sent Equifax (alongside many other companies) a notice on March 8th, 2017 about the vulnerability in certain versions of Apache Struts. Equifax sent out an internal mass-email, which should have required its internal IT team to fix the vulnerability within 48 hours, but that didn't happen. An automatic scan for vulnerabilities on March 15th also failed to indicate that Equifax was using a Struts version that had the vulnerability. \nBased on Equifax's postmortem investigations, the hacker that exploited this exact weakness likely first used it to pry into Equifax on May 13th, and then continued until July 30th, and Equifax's security tools were none the wiser. Only suspicious traffic in and out of its system on July 29th tipped the company off to the breach. From there, the company investigated the breach. \nDuring his testimony, Smith identified the company IT employee who should have applied the patch as responsible: \"The human error was that the individual who's responsible for communicating in the organization to apply the patch, did not.\" \nThat didn't stop the committee from thrashing Smith and Equifax's failure to protect user data. Lawmakers pondered over how to prevent similar breaches in the future, but focused on the company's failure in what might be the hearing's iconic quote: \"How does this happen when so much is at stake?\" Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) said to Smith. \"I don't think we can pass a law that fixes stupid.\" \nBut the committee didn't forget the ultimate consequence of the breach: The personal data genie can't go back in the bottle. \n\"You can't change your Social Security number and I can't change my mother's maiden name,\" Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) said in the hearing, according to The Los Angeles Times . \"This data is out there forever.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "debbie dingell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin lamarque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg walden", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "los angeles times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of homeland security's computer emergency readiness team", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house energy and commerce committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T23:58:55.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0c9884b104b608c1e15fc2021fd656414d5141bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSduuADMF1DcExTbo6Sj2Ceqvyk8GKwPEOg4h0a0f7PQ8u00nLXpbjL7pNJfAz_ORcsU6qU5eupDhOApfJy7uaC", "site_full": "www.engadget.com", "site": "engadget.com", "site_section": "http://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Engadget RSS Feed", "title": "Yahoo admits 2013 hack impacted all 3 billion of its accounts", "title_full": "Yahoo admits 2013 hack impacted all 3 billion of its accounts", "published": "2017-10-03T23:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&amp;quality=80&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fimages%2Fdims%3Fcrop%3D3500%252C2332%252C0%252C0%26quality%3D85%26format%3Djpg%26resize%3D1600%252C1067%26image_uri%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fo.aolcdn.com%252Fhss%252Fstorage%252Fmidas%252Fa3149843eae12bc877a22e69d0145e5e%252F204022190%252FRTSGHDK.jpeg%26client%3Da1acac3e1b3290917d92%26signature%3D05b1a21a7d5cb6e65698c7a0d94688c34fa0b12a&amp;client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&amp;signature=5e645163b924a5b75c4e9f09056397216b799c98", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 437, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1131, "comments": 0, "shares": 1131}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 114}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0c9884b104b608c1e15fc2021fd656414d5141bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSduuADMF1DcExTbo6Sj2Ceqvyk8GKwPEOg4h0a0f7PQ8u00nLXpbjL7pNJfAz_ORcsU6qU5eupDhOApfJy7uaC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Richard Lawler", "published": "2017-10-03T23:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Yahoo admits 2013 hack impacted all 3 billion of its accounts", "text": "Yahoo's 2013 hack impacted all 3 billion accounts Not just one billion as previously announced -- it was all of them.

Today, the combined company announced that further investigation reveals the 2013 hack affected all of its accounts that existed at the time -- about three billion. The information taken \"may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (using MD5) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers.\" \nFor users being notified of the hack now, the notification is that their information is included.

According to the FAQ posted, it doesn't appear there's any new action being taken. \nThe announcement isn't very specific about why or how it determined the breach was so much larger -- or how it was missed in the original forensic analysis, or how this happened in the first place -- likely due to pending lawsuits over the issue. This section of the statement is all it would say: \nSubsequent to Yahoo's acquisition by Verizon, and during integration, the company recently obtained new intelligence and now believes, following an investigation with the assistance of outside forensic experts, that all Yahoo user accounts were affected by the August 2013 theft. While this is not a new security issue, Yahoo is sending email notifications to the additional affected user accounts. The investigation indicates that the user account information that was stolen did not include passwords in clear text, payment card data, or bank account information.

Save Nicole Lee / Engadget \nEarlier today, Microsoft and Samsung announced the latest Windows Mixed Reality headset: the Samsung HMD Odyssey . At $499, it's certainly one of the pricier options out of all the Windows Mixed Reality headsets so far. And for good reason. Not only does it come with integrated AKG headphones -- which is very similar to the Rift's design -- it has absolutely stunning image quality. Gallery: Samsung HMD Odyssey hands-on | 8 Photos 8 +4 \nThe HMD Odyssey is equipped with dual 3.5-inch AMOLED displays, each of which have a 1,440 x 1,600 resolution with a refresh rate of 90 to 60 hertz. The result is a brilliantly sharp and crisp virtual environment -- when I took a brief Holotour of Machu Picchu, I genuinely felt like I was there, floating above the mountains on a hot air balloon. Color reproduction is fantastic, and there was none of the screendoor effect that so often plagues VR headsets of lesser quality. The 110-degree field of view also contributes to the feeling of immersion, which is especially apparent when viewing 360-degree videos and photos. \nYet, this thing is pretty big. It measures 202mm x 131.5mm x 111m and it weighs in at a whopping 625 grams. That's definitely a lot heavier than the Acer's 380 grams. It also just looks pretty bulky on the whole. That said, when I placed the whole thing on my head, it didn't feel so bad. It fits nice and snug, and I loved the feeling of the leather padding around my head. I could see myself wearing this for a few hours at a time. \nOther specs of the HMD Odyssey include two cameras on the front, each of which give the headset six degrees of freedom. It also has a proximity sensor, an IPD sensor, a built-in microphone, volume adjustment and a couple of dials that help you find the right fit and focus. I also like it that you can wear the headset while wearing your glasses. \nDuring my demo, I had a chance to try out the new Halo Recruit title for a few minutes. As was teased, it's not quite a game as much as a demo of what Halo could look like in VR. Most of what I did was fire at moving targets in a tutorial phase. I found that targeting is sometimes an issue, as I couldn't just look at something to aim (like I can with a lot of other VR games) I had to actually really aim at it with my virtual gun. Still, it was just my first experience with it and I can see myself getting better over time. \nThe Halo Recruit demo will be available on October 17th for free from the Windows Store, along with 20,000-plus other apps made for Windows Mixed Reality. Samsung's HMD Odyssey is available for pre-order today, with a ship date of November 6th.

Save Engadget \nLike it or not, DxOMark is currently the go-to tester for smartphone camera quality. Companies will even base their marketing around its scores . As such, it's a big deal when the outfit declares a new winner... and it just declared two . DxOMark has given Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 an overall score of 94, putting it in a tie for the lead with the iPhone 8 Plus . No, that's not going to trigger endless fan wars, is it? Of course, diving into the scores reveals that the devices reached their scores through different means. \nThe Note 8's advantages chiefly come through its secondary camera, relatively noiseless low-light photography and lightning-quick autofocus. Of the two, Samsung's phone is the one you'd want for portraits or capturing a fast-moving scene. The iPhone, on the other hand, has exceptional high dynamic range performance, accurate face exposure and great overall video performance, particularly with stabilization. And both have their weak points, as you might imagine. The Note 8 has a fairly limited dynamic range that results in lost detail in extreme situations, and has white balance problems in bright lighting or indoors. Apple's device occasionally struggles with autofocus, doesn't always nail the color cast in low lighting and has visible noise in low-light video. \nThe question is: how much does this influence your choice of device? Frankly, it's complicated. Some of it clearly depends on personal preference based on your photography habits: you may pick the iPhone if you prefer a more accurate color range, or the Note 8 if you enjoy low-light shooting. This also assumes you treat DxOMark's scores as canonical -- it can't account for every situation with tests, and it may downplay factors that you consider crucial. And of course, there's the simple matter of liking the rest of the phone. If you're a hardcore Android or iOS fan, even the best camera in history probably wouldn't convince you to switch sides.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dxomark", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:22:17.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f4d7b3d45c5d72a7f20f87792e3181bbc55f1266", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSduuADMF1DcExTbo6Sj2Ceqvyk8GKwPENR.qIOp491Rne7V48j8YU9pf.s4OGvYDRTvIOUjBgvTmC7EU9hHu1.JhrFBvZKiuHjzrOwodxKxg--", "site_full": "www.engadget.com", "site": "engadget.com", "site_section": "http://goicicidirect.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Engadget RSS Feed", "title": "IRS hands fraud prevention contract to Equifax despite massive hack", "title_full": "IRS hands fraud prevention contract to Equifax despite massive hack", "published": "2017-10-04T01:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&amp;quality=80&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fimages%2Fdims%3Fcrop%3D5760%252C3840%252C0%252C0%26quality%3D85%26format%3Djpg%26resize%3D1600%252C1067%26image_uri%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fo.aolcdn.com%252Fhss%252Fstorage%252Fmidas%252F7f4382afde703d0117089376bcebe26c%252F205673246%252Fmonitor-displays-equifax-inc-signage-on-the-floor-of-the-new-york-picture-id847486100%26client%3Da1acac3e1b3290917d92%26signature%3D2a3490df587b4f7d2acd361cdf119ed3316ddea0&amp;client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&amp;signature=9dfe58adb4827df573891a7edde2629ada86c8dd", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 437, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1204, "comments": 1, "shares": 1204}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 129}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f4d7b3d45c5d72a7f20f87792e3181bbc55f1266", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSduuADMF1DcExTbo6Sj2Ceqvyk8GKwPENR.qIOp491Rne7V48j8YU9pf.s4OGvYDRTvIOUjBgvTmC7EU9hHu1.JhrFBvZKiuHjzrOwodxKxg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jon Fingas", "published": "2017-10-04T01:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "IRS hands fraud prevention contract to Equifax despite massive hack", "text": "IRS hands fraud prevention contract to Equifax despite massive hack Are you sure you've been keeping up with current events, IRS? Save Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images \nYou'd think that government agencies would be reticent to work with Equifax given that it just exposed the private info of more than 145 million people through a preventable hack , but a massive data breach apparently isn't enough of a deterrent. The Internal Revenue Service recently awarded Equifax a fraud prevention contract that will have it verifying taxpayer identities. And crucially, it was a no-bid, \"sole source\" contract -- Equifax was deemed the only company capable of fulfilling demand. \nIn practice, officials didn't have much of a choice. Credit reporting in the US is dominated by three large companies (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion), and Equifax is arguably the powerhouse of the bunch. However, that only underscores the problem here: the IRS had to trust a crucial anti-fraud system to a company that not only had sloppy online security practices, but has been reluctant to take full responsibility for its mistakes. \nThere's a real chance that the hack will get Equifax to clean up its act in time to improve its handling of IRS data. We wouldn't count on it, though, and there's always the possibility that the IRS will fall afoul of the kind of data breach that prompted this anti-fraud contract in the first place.

Throughout the year, it has been testing an Instagram shopping feature, but it's now opening the tool up to thousands of additional merchants just in time for the holiday shopping season, TechCrunch reports. The feature lets sellers tag items in an Instagram post that are available for purchase and viewers can then click those tags to buy the items without having to leave Instagram. \nInstagram first introduced shopping tags into its platform last November, but they were only available to a handful of brands, such as Kate Spade and Warby Parker. Earlier this year, Instagram opened them up to Shopify and BigCommerce. Since then, Shopify has been testing the feature with a handful of its merchants before widely releasing it and the company says seller response has been enthusiastic.

Save SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty Images \nSamsung can't force a closed-door proceeding to settle a lawsuit filed by a customer who felt misled about the capabilities of his Galaxy S4, the Supreme Court has ruled . The Korean tech giant has been trying to squash the lawsuit since it was filed, arguing that any customer who buys the S4 agrees to private arbitration, since it's a clause in its warranty booklet. The plaintiff, Daniel Norcia, fought back by pointing out that he bought the device from a Verizon store, where an employee set it up for him. He said he left the phone's box and warranty booklet in the store. \nLower courts previously agreed with Norcia that a clause in a warranty booklet isn't enough to inform consumers that they're agreeing to private arbitration proceedings in case situations arise. Now, Norcia has scored what Consumerist calls a \"rare win,\" as the Supreme Court doesn't always agree with the lower courts' decisions or side with a customer. As the publication said, by allowing the lawsuit to move forward, the Supreme Court is giving Norcia the chance to hold the company accountable in public.

Save Christophe Morin/Bloomberg via Getty Images \nMore details are emerging about the Russia-linked ads Facebook handed over to Congressional investigators just days ago. According to multiple sources who spoke to CNN , a number of the paid posts specifically targeted two states that were crucial to Trump's victory in November: Michigan and Wisconsin. Facebook has already revealed that the 3,000 ads (viewed by roughly 10 million people) focused on \"divisive social political messages,\" including issues about race, LGBT topics, immigration, and gun rights. But, the latest info sheds light on the geographic and demographical targeting of the promotional messages -- two aspects Facebook has not discussed in detail. \nTrump beat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Michigan by just 10,704 votes. Wisconsin too was a tight race, with Trump grabbing victory by 22,700 votes. Just days after the results were announced, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg swiped back at his critics by claiming it was \"crazy\" to think that fake news on his platform swayed the election. He's since said he regrets those remarks. But, bogus articles were just part of the machinery used by nefarious forces, along with promoted events , and ads. The latter saw Facebook's comprehensive (and controversial ) ad targeting tool utilized to target groups in key areas of Michigan and Wisconsin, people with knowledge on the matter told CNN . \nFacebook is cooperating with the Senate Intelligence Committee investigating Russia's alleged social media interference during the elections. However, it's not the only one in the dock. Twitter also recently handed over evidence of over 1,800 Russia Today accounts that posted targeted ads in the US. Total Spend on the advertisements, which were also created during the 2016 election, came to $274,100. Despite its willingness to hand over data, it seems the company has not shut down several accounts associated with the so-called propagandist news outlet. As Recode points out, the @RT_com, @RT_America, and @ActualidadRT are still fully active. What's more, they have not reportedly been banned from advertising on the platform. \nElsewhere, Russia Today has lost a powerful soapbox. Google -- which is also being rounded up as part of the Senate's extensive investigation -- just removed Russia Today from its premium YouTube ad program (known as Google Preferred).

Save Cambridge Consultants \nDrone deliveries -- the impatient consumer's Holy Grail -- have been in the pipeline for some time, and while Amazon is pioneering the cause, (although Rival 7-Eleven has completed nearly 100 aerial deliveries to date), its model is still somewhat encumbered by factors at odds with the advantages drone delivery technically offers. Recipients need to be present at an address, for example. Now, though, Cambridge Consultants -- the team that brought us intelligent bins and Renaissance doodling -- has developed a drone delivery system that'll get you your stuff anytime, anywhere, in a matter of minutes. \nLet's imagine you're out having a nice walk in the middle of the countryside when you start feeling peckish. Using Cambridge Consultants ' DelivAir app, you'd place an order for a snack, and the delivering drone would use GPS and your smartphone signal to navigate to your location, periodically asking for location updates during its flight, until it's within visual range. Once it arrives, you point your mobile phone flash LED to the sky, where it'll blink a coded pattern to let the drone know it's delivering to the right person. Then, while staying a safe height above the ground, the drone lowers the package into your very hands using a stabilising winch, which you then unhook. The drone then makes its merry way back to base, and you've got your snack, or whatever else it is you urgently need in the middle of countryside. \nOf course, there are multiple applications for this type of service, fervent consumerism aside. It could be used to take a puncture repair kit to a stranded cyclist, or essential supplies to remote areas as part of disaster relief efforts. There's life-saving potential, too; DelivAir could swiftly get EpiPens or defibrillators to people in urgent need. \"Drone delivery is fast and ideal for something that is needed immediately. In that case, a consumer wants a delivery directly to them as a person \u2013 not to a location,\" said Nathan Wrench, head of the industrial and energy business at Cambridge Consultants. \"Our DelivAir concept has the potential to revolutionize the delivery process, by removing the address restriction that other drone technologies are limited by.\" \nIndeed, DelivAir's ultra-precise delivery concept makes perfect sense for drone application, but as is the case with Amazon, 7-Eleven and other drone delivery champions, there are still question marks hanging over the mainstream roll out of this kind of service.

Save REUTERS \nUber's board members got together to vote on some big changes that will allow a significant investment to push through. In a statement, the ride-hailing firm said that the board \"voted unanimously to move forward with the proposed investment by SoftBank and with governance changes that would strengthen its independence and ensure equality among all shareholders.\" The changes they made to comply with the Japanese telecom titan's request for a shift in governance structure includes removing special voting powers that come with certain types of Uber stock. Former CEO Travis Kalanick , for instance, owns a third of what's called the Class B common stock, which had a 10-to-one voting power. Now each share equals to one vote only. \nThe new rules will reportedly make it hard for Kalanick to become the most powerful person in the firm again in more ways than one. According to Bloomberg , Kalanick and new Uber chief Dara Khosrowshahi are both barred from sitting as chairman of the board's committees or subcommittees under the new rules. In addition, a new CEO would need to be backed by two-thirds of the board. Since another governance change involves the expansion of the board to 17 seats, two of which are meant to be occupied by Softbank, that wouldn't be easy to accomplish. \nIn case Kalanick or any other former exec still garners enough votes to become the new chief, then investors will have the right to sell all their shares. That would give Benchmark Capital, the board member that became instrumental in Kalanick's exit as CEO, will have an out in case the company founder gets his old position back. Aside from all these new rules that diminish the powers of its old chief, Uber has also agreed to go public by 2019. If it fails to do so, it will have to lift restrictions on shareholders from selling their stakes. \nWhile the board vote represents a major development in the investment, the two have yet to finalize a deal. In case everything goes well, Softbank will begin by investing between $1 billion and $1.25 billion in Uber before buying stocks from existing shareholders. It ultimately wants to have a 14 percent to 17 percent stake in the company, so the ride-hailing giant might have to convince some people to let go of part of their shares if it wants Softbank's money.

Save AFP/Getty Images \nThe European Commission has announced that it will refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice for not collecting back taxes that it is owed by Apple . More than a year after a sweetheart deal between Ireland and the iPhone maker was ruled illegal , the country has dragged its feet in asking Tim Cook for the cash. Tired of waiting around, Commissioner Margrethe Vestager (pictured) has referred the nation to the continent's highest court, which can then impose fines for non-compliance. \nThe backstory here is that the European Union wants to create a functional free and open market that allows competition to flourish. But some nations, looking to host big name companies, could be tempted to either give them a whopping tax break or actively fund their development costs. These deals, known as \"state aid,\" are known to distort the market and make the playing field far more uneven than it should be. \nBack in 1991, Apple signed a deal with the Irish government that let it use a special tax loophole called the \" double Irish .\" It's believed that Apple has used the loophole to store two thirds of its non-US profits inside this tax haven. The result is that Ireland essentially turned a blind eye to the better part of $14.5 billion that it would have been owed had the loophole not existed. The EU opened an investigation into the deal in 2013 , and in 2016 demanded that Ireland collect the cash . \nIreland doesn't feel that it's doing anything wrong, and has appealed the decision of the court declaring the tax break as illegal. As The Independent points out, Ireland relies on foreign investment for many of its jobs, and doesn't want to collect the cash for fear of alienating other businesses. That said, the country has pledged to collect the tax, but claims that it won't be in a position to know how much it will ask for until March 2018. That's not good enough for Vestager or the law, which says that EU states have just four months from the decision to get moving -- meaning that Ireland should have sent a strongly-worded letter to Apple by January of this year. \nThe issue of Apple's taxation is a contentious one, but the company has drawn ire even in the United States. In 2013, Senator Carl Levin penned a report examining that Apple managed to negotiate its global tax rate down to just two percent. In the US, it would have to pay at least 15 percent. Tim Cook, however, believes that Apple should only be taxed where its value is created -- i.e. only at the company's R&D sites in California. \nIn response, Ireland's Department of Finance said that it is complying with its obligations, even if it doesn't agree with the decision of the court. It feels that Vestager's decision to hurry the process along is \"extremely regrettable,\" since parsing out $14.5 billion in tax is pretty complex. It'll be interesting to see how this plays out, and how it effects Ireland's relationship with the technology giant going forward. \nIreland has never accepted the Commission's analysis in the Apple State Aid Decision. \nHowever, we have always been clear that the Government is fully committed to ensuring that recovery of the alleged Apple state aid takes place without delay and has committed significant resources to ensuring this is achieved. Ireland fully respects the rule of law in the European Union. \nThat is why it is extremely disappointing that the Commission has taken action at this time against Ireland. \nIrish officials and experts have been engaged in intensive work to ensure that the State complies with all its recovery obligations as soon as possible, and have been in constant contact with the European Commission and Apple on all aspects of this process for over a year. \nIt is extremely regrettable that the Commission has taken this action, especially in relation to a case with such a large scale recovery amount. Ireland has made significant progress on this complex issue and is close to the establishment of an escrow fund, in compliance with all relevant Irish constitutional and European Union law. \nThe work on the establishment of the escrow fund to deal with the unprecedented recovery amount will continue, notwithstanding the fact that Commission has taken this wholly unnecessary step.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tim cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margrethe vestager", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vestager", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carl levin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european court of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of finance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T14:24:14.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dbb49097f967dbf5547b9db20063850c14418234", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSduuADMF1DcExTbo6Sj2Ceqvyk8GKwPEOnCQFSxpC6SC54DvMqckefv3IXyvji5Xu2zQZOtVHs7eEO5PICP86s", "site_full": "www.engadget.com", "site": "engadget.com", "site_section": "http://www.engadget.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Engadget RSS Feed", "title": "EU: Amazon must pay back \u20ac250 million in unfair tax benefits", "title_full": "EU: Amazon must pay back \u20ac250 million in unfair tax benefits", "published": "2017-10-04T13:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&amp;quality=80&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F31a570ea3c263b754dd1b78dad5c3e4b%2F205733293%2Feu.jpeg&amp;client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&amp;signature=79a71e05604509c48c5a089e3bdbf6ae4ec35add", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 437, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 31, "comments": 0, "shares": 31}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 10}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dbb49097f967dbf5547b9db20063850c14418234", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSduuADMF1DcExTbo6Sj2Ceqvyk8GKwPEOnCQFSxpC6SC54DvMqckefv3IXyvji5Xu2zQZOtVHs7eEO5PICP86s", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mat Smith", "published": "2017-10-04T13:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "EU: Amazon must pay back \u20ac250 million in unfair tax benefits", "text": "EU: Amazon must pay back \u20ac250 million in unfair tax benefits It's up to Luxembourg to recover the money.

The antitrust regulator says this let Amazon avoid taxation on three quarters of the profits it made from all Amazon sales in the EU. \nAmazon sent Engadget this statement: \n\"We believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg and that we paid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law. We will study the Commission's ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal. Our 50,000 employees across Europe remain heads-down focused on serving our customers and the hundreds of thousands of small businesses who work with us.\" \nThere are no EU fines here. The rules outline that the country needs to recover the sum of benefits to \"remove the distortion of competition created by the aid\". The Commission has worked out the difference between what the company paid in taxes and what it should have without Luxembourg's tax ruling -- around \u20ac250 million, plus interest. The onus is now on the tax authorities of Luxembourg to determine the precise amount of unpaid tax. Vestager suggests that Amazon will have to repay these benefits to Luxembourg. . @amazon tax benefits in Luxembourg are illegal under our common European rules on state aid. Amazon to repay benefits worth around \u20ac250 mio \u2014 Margrethe Vestager (@vestager) October 4, 2017 \nThe European Commission's findings follow its recent investigation into Google's shopping listings -- and the resulting record fine.

As spotted by Android Police , Assistant now also boasts a male option. Fittingly, Google has bestowed the impersonal, robotic voice with the nondescript title: \"Voice II.\" To switch to the new intonation (probably in US English only), select settings on your phone Assistant or the Google Home app. The voice options can then be found in preferences, under \"assistant voice.\" \nOthers have pointed out the problematic questions gendered digital assistants raise, especially when they're designated female voices. That's the default mode for Siri. Meanwhile, Microsoft's Cortana is voiced by Jen Taylor . And, Amazon named its AI Alexa. Therefore, it's good to see Google branching out. Plus, the more options the better -- bring on Bill Murray next. \nBoth male and female versions of Google's digital helper will soon be heard emanating from a range of new Google hardware .

Share Save \nIn recent years, laptop makers focused on squeezing longer-lasting batteries and incrementally better performance into thinner, lighter and more attractive bodies . Those improvements are beneficial, but on the whole it feels like the industry is having trouble coming up with new features that are truly helpful. That's why HP's latest mainstream laptop feels refreshing. In addition to the usual performance bumps and smaller footprint, it offers a built-in privacy shield that you can toggle with a dedicated key -- something its competitors haven't offered (or copied) yet. I checked out a pre-production unit of the new Spectre x360 13 at a recent demo in New York and want one just for the protective screen. Gallery: HP Spectre x360 13 hands-on | 14 Photos 14 +10 \nHP introduced the \"Sure View\" privacy screen in its Elitebook line of commercial laptops last year . The Elitebook series is aimed at business users who want to protect, say, confidential presentations on the go, and it made sense to offer Sure View to them first. But the rest of us deal with sensitive info as well, so it's nice to see the company bring this to its mainstream line. \nYou can toggle the privacy screen by pressing a button on the keyboard's function row where the F2 key usually sits. This hides your content from people in your vicinity by making the display look completely white unless you're directly in front of it. During my demo, the Spectre x360's screen looked like a blank white canvas when I stood at an extreme angle from it. When I moved closer to the center, though, I could make out colors and shapes like the green header row of an Excel spreadsheet. But it was only when I faced the computer head on that I could see the actual words on the screen. \nFrankly, the text on our demo unit was so small that I probably couldn't read what it said unless I was up close, either. Still, having the privacy screen can provide some extra peace of mind, and the dedicated button toggle is convenient, too. I've lost track of how many times I've anxiously looked over my shoulder to make sure no one was glancing at my screen when I worked on confidential stories or entering my credit card information at an airport or a press conference. \nThe Sure View upgrade will cost you an additional $100, which, considering third-party privacy shields cost about $30 , seems a bit steep. But you'll get the convenience of switching it on and off whenever you want without having to deal with flimsy attachments that could lose their stickiness (or magnetism) over time. \nAs with most laptops being updated for the holiday season, the new Spectre x360 13 will come equipped with 8th-generation Intel chipsets (Core i5 and i7 options), specifically the U series that now packs four cores instead of just two. HP said that in addition to performance improvements, this infrastructure should also extend battery life, and the company estimates the laptop will last up to 16.5 hours. The Spectre x360 also gained a fingerprint sensor along the right edge of the laptop for convenient identity verification, but it requires a bit of searching to find. You'll still have the IR camera above the screen for Windows Hello logins, though. Oh, and the device's 13.3-inch screen got bumped up from full HD resolution to 4K. \nHP also unveiled the new Spectre 13 laptop, which features CPU and battery improvements while retaining the same svelte 10.4mm profile as its predecessor . In fact, this year's Spectre 13 is actually slightly smaller than its older brother, since HP managed to narrow down the display bezels and get rid of the space around the keyboard. The touchpad is wider, with an aspect ratio that's closer to the screen's for more intuitive navigation. The company finally added touchscreens on some configurations (only non-touch before) and display resolutions now go up to 4K. Plus, there's a new \"Ceramic White\" color option for those who wanted an alternative to existing the grey/copper version, and I'd have a hard time picking one since both models are equally attractive. \nThe Spectre laptop and the Spectre x360 13 start at $1,300 and $1,150 respectively, and will be available in stores on October 29th. If you already know for sure that you want one, you can also pre-order it on Best Buy's website, although I would caution you to wait until we get to check out a production-ready unit before you splurge.

Share Save Fashion Tech Labs' Miroslava Duma (second from left), Patricia Ermecheo from Osomtex (left) and Stella McCartney (right) discuss sustainable fashion with actor Selma Hayek and her spouse, Kering CEO Henri-Fran\u00e7ois Pinault. Engadget \nOn Sunday, there were no cars in Paris as the city clamped down on soaring pollution and tried to honor the climate accord that bears its name. With Paris Fashion Week here too, garment makers must face their own part in the planet's despoilment. An incubator called Fashion Tech Labs (FTL) is trying to break the textile pollution cycle with new tech like stem-cell leather, recycled fabrics and ultra-strong spider-silk-based fibers. At Google's Paris Arts & Culture Center, I had a look at some of the tech and talked with FTL and the event's esteemed host, sustainable designer and fashion icon Stella McCartney. \nThe fashion industry uses obscene amounts of water and fills dumps and oceans with materials that linger for generations. \"You have to understand the impact the fashion industry has on our environment,\" McCartney told Engadget. \"It's the second-most-harmful industry on the planet. We need to take responsibility.\" \nMcCartney is on the forefront of sustainable fashion, having used \"skin-free leather,\" recycled fabrics and other innovative materials ever since her company launched 16 years ago. Another major manufacturer experimenting with the idea is Adidas, which has developed several shoes in conjunction with ocean-plastics recycling organization Parley. Adidas plans to eventually produce up to a million of its Ultraboost Uncaged Parley shoes by the end of 2017, but for now, production is in the thousands. Gallery: Fashion Tech Lab at Google Arts & Culture Center | 11 Photos 11 +7 \nUnless the majority of clothing and footwear companies -- and not just high-end fashion lines like Stella McCartney or select manufacturers like Adidas -- start to make sustainability a priority, the problem will only get worse. \nThat's where Russian fashion industry scion Miroslava Duma and her new organization come in. Fashion Tech Labs is an incubator for sustainable fashion, wearable electronics and other cutting-edge clothing, jewelry and designer innovations. FTL is one of a new breed of such research and incubation firms that see garment-industry waste as not just a problem to be solved, but a financial opportunity. \n\"This is a revolution that's coming,\" said Duma. \"So we'd rather be in, because it's going to happen anyway.\" \nDuma's company organized the event along with McCartney and Google's Arts & Culture Lab, which has a tie-in via its recently launched We Wear Culture virtual style exhibition. The idea was to show off some of the tech that's germinating, often literally, at Fashion Tech Lab. \nThat includes VitroLabs tissue engineering, which creates ethical leather from cow, ostrich and crocodile cells, and Worn Again, which recycles discarded textiles, saving copious amounts of water, oil and other raw resources. Other companies include Bolt Threads, which produces high-tensile-strength materials molecularly derived from spider silk, Diamond Foundry's \"morally pure\" man-made diamonds that are \"optically and atomically the same as a mined diamond,\" and Mint Materials, which is producing a plant-based antibacterial and odor-control treatment for clothing. \nAll of these companies are doing cutting-edge work that, in some cases, has yet to be commercialized. To help, FTL used the Paris show as an opportunity to introduce them to both investors and the press. \n\"We use advanced stem-cell technology and tissue engineering to create full-thickness skin that we then tan and turn into leather,\" VitroLabs co-founder Ingvar Helgason told Engadget. \"This completely removes the need for animals; it reduces the environmental impact and allows us to enjoy the beautiful materials that we've become accustomed to, but without the environmental or ethical implications.\" \nVitroLabs showed off a piece of the leather, which was, to say the least, weird. However, the company has made only small chunks of skin and is still working on scaling it up (though it says it will have an announcement about that soon). Suffice it to say, VitroLabs needs tons of capital, support, and a network of fashion contacts, which it hopes to get in spades from Fashion Tech Lab and Duma. \n\"Fashion Tech Lab is working across a couple of different pillars, the first one being investment into these startups,\" said the company's chief of technology and research, Dr. Amanda Parkes. \"We're really trying to grow and scale these technologies to make them accessible and connect them with luxury and big fashion brands.\" \nThe company is certainly creating a buzz for its clients. At one point while shooting photos and video, I looked up and standing right in front of me was McCartney, actor Salma Hayek and Diane von Furstenberg , checking out the VitroLabs leather and schmoozing with Duma. \nThe fact that celebrities and designers are taking an interest in sustainable fashion tech is a good sign. Wearable technology needs fashion designers more than fashion designers need technology -- smartwatches, for instance, were moribund until Apple, Fossil, Tag Heuer and others introduced decent-looking products. \nSome of the technology, from Diamond Foundry and VitroLabs, for example, is aimed at the high-end luxury fashion business, for now. \"[We have] a customer base that really does care about sustainability,\" said Ian Rogers, chief digital officer at ultra-luxury brand LVMH. \"If we can upgrade the high-quality materials that we work with and make the planet better along the way, that's a win.\" \nBut what about the rest of us? Recycled textiles and materials made from ocean waste and other sources seem to hold the most promise for the larger consumer market. With its ocean-plastic shoe, Adidas proved that customers are buying into the premise, and Stella McCartney thinks manufacturers and designers needn't worry about demand. \n\"The consumers are way ahead, sadly, of the designers and businesses,\" she said. \"And I hope the industry is seeing that we seem so old-fashioned. [Textile waste] is really quite terrifying, so I hope that they go away from this event and reflect on how they need to do something about it now.\" By Steve Dent @stevetdent \nSteve should have known that civil engineering was not for him when he spent most of his time at university monkeying with his 8086 clone PC.

Today, at an event in New York City, the company unveiled the Sonos One , a device billed as \" The Smart Speaker for Music Lovers. \" As expected, the main attraction here are the voice features, which at launch will be powered by Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant. We say \"at launch\" because Sonos CEO, Patrick Spence, ended the presentation with the news that the One will also work with Google Assistant in 2018. \nYou'll notice right away that the new speaker, which arrives October 24th for $199/\u00a3199, looks nearly identical to the Play:1 . That said, the One does come with a few aesthetic changes, including a ring of microphone holes, an LED light and the traditional play/pause button -- all located on the top panel. Additionally, the grill has been tweaked subtly and it now comes in two colors: all-black and all-white. When asked what exactly changed internally, aside from addition of an array of mics, Sonos only went as far as to say that the One was \"reengineered\" from the ground up and features the \"same great sound\" as the Play:1. Gallery: Sonos One hands-on | 10 Photos 10 +6 \nIf you've ever owned any Sonos hardware, then you know it has a reputation for sounding great. And the One isn't an exception. During our demo of the speaker, we listened to a couple of tracks, including one from Drake and another from David Bowie, and everything in the room sounded crisp, with balanced lows, mids and highs, and not too much bass. The Alexa voice commands worked as smoothly as you'd hope, with the assistant playing tracks and honoring other voice commands in a matter of a second or two, if not less. \nOnce you say something like \"Alexa, play More Life ,\" the LED on the top of the speaker lights up and lets you know that the assistant is processing your command. Sonos says it wanted the voice-recognition system to be visually quiet, hence the subtle light blink. At the same time, though, the company wanted to make it easy for users to know every time the microphone is active. What's more, you can use the One to control other Sonos speakers in your home with your voice -- think: \"Alexa, play David Bowie's greatest hits in the living room.\" We expect Google's own platform to perform just as well as Amazon's next year, when it's scheduled to hit the Sonos One. \nThose of you who already own a Sonos speaker shouldn't be completely jealous of the One. The company also announced earlier that Alexa voice control is coming to existing models in a public beta , albeit you'll need a device such as an Echo Dot to make that work. Meanwhile, support for Apple's AirPlay 2 will also be coming to the One and other Sonos speakers in 2018, which will allow you control them directly using your iOS device, like an iPhone or iPad. \nAllen Mask, head of partnerships at Sonos, says the company needed to make its platform more open in order to keep evolving. \"We were missing the element of openness,\" he said. \"We can develop these technologies [on our own], but we can only go so far. Opening up the platform makes it faster to get to where we want to go.\" As for whether or not the One is intended to replace the Play:1, Mask said that's not the plan for the foreseeable future, noting that Sonos is just as excited about making hardware work with an Alexa add-on as it is about its new speaker.

Save Google Home Max Google \nAt today's Made by Google event , the company has introduced a buffed up version of its Home assistant device called the Google Home Max. This version of the speaker uses premium materials and improved speakers (dual 4.5-inch high-excursion woofers, two custom tweeters), putting it in position to compete with products like those from Sonos (like the upcoming Sonos One that also has Assistant built-in) or Apple's upcoming HomePod . Gallery: Google Home Max | 14 Photos 14 +10 \nAvailable in December for $399 , it uses AI-powered Smart Sound (running on a quad-core CPU) to tune the audio for whatever room it's in. One example Google gave is that if it's positioned near a wall or in a corner, it will adjust to reduce excess bass response -- hopefully those of us who like excess bass can tweak that in the settings -- and says it will continue to get smarter over time. It's also smart enough to recognize the \"Ok Google\" command even while it's playing music loudly, turns down the volume in the morning, and can get louder when the environment is noisy. If you purchase two, they can pair up with left and right channel separation. \nGoogle Play Music and YouTube (12 months of YouTube Music access is included) support is a given, but others like Spotify, Pandora, Netflix and others are also listed as partners . Beyond Bluetooth, WiFi and USB-C it also has a line-in so you can BYO audio source.

Save Google \nGoogle has announced the second generation of its venerated Pixel handsets , the Pixel 2 and its larger sibling, the Pixel 2 XL. Rather than attempting to compete on specifications, the company is hoping that its software know-how and a refined design will woo customers. The headline feature, perhaps, is that the Pixels will abandon the 3.5mm headphone jack on its smartphones. Instead, users will need to connect their analog headphones using the bundled 3.5mm USB-C adapter. Gallery: Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL | 9 Photos 9 +5 \nThe search giant has also made a big deal about the fact that there is feature parity between both handsets -- a swipe at Apple, which saves more-advanced camera features for its Plus devices. One of the features is an always-on display that constantly shows you the time and your notifications. The device will also have a persistent music-spotting feature like Shazam , for when you want to know what's playing in the coffee shop. \nThe Pixel 2's cameras are also getting an upgrade , with the primary lens packing a 12.2-megapixel sensor with an f/1.8 aperture and OIS. This lens will be coupled with Google's computational-photography smarts to offer a variety of features that other manufacturers need two distinct lenses for. That includes portrait mode on both the front and rear cameras and smoother video, thanks to a combination of optical- and digital-image stabilization. \nThose concerned about storage woes, given the quantity of photos they are likely to take with these devices, can rest easy as well. Google has once again reaffirmed its commitment to storing every photo taken with the Pixel 2 in full resolution on its web servers for free. \nAs for specifications, the Pixel 2 is packing a 5-inch AMOLED screen with an FHD resolution (1,920 x 1,080) while the XL is packing a 6-inch QHD+ pOLED display (2,880 x 1,440). Inside you'll find a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 paired with 4GB RAM and either 64 or 128GB of storage. The smaller handset is packing a 2,700mAh battery while the larger has a whopping 3,520mAh cell. Both displays are protected from the elements with a slice of Corning Gorilla Glass 5. \nAs for software, the device will also ship with Android 8.0 Oreo, contrary to some rumors that it would arrive with 8.1. The company is guaranteeing that the handset will be supported for a minimum of three years, reassuring users who may be concerned about missing out on future updates. There's also the option to use an eSIM , although the handset will accept a single nanoSIM card. \nBoth handsets are also water and dust resistant to IP67 and fast charging, with the company promising that 15 minutes of charging will give you seven hours of life. There are also a pair of stereo speakers flanking the front of the display, although the company has yet to explain much about their power and potential. \nAt the event, Google's hardware chief Rick Osterloh spoke about how the field for smartphone manufacturers has flattened. After all, the components that go inside every Android device are pretty much the same, to the point where it's hard to tell one from another. That's why the new Pixels (alongside the rest of Google's new products) are leaning in hard on AI and software tweaks as their key selling points. Osterloh described them as \"radically helpful,\" capable of anticipating your needs before you know you need them. \nPart of that initiative, as well as the always-on display, is a notification pane embedded into the home screen that informs you of important calendar appointments. Meanwhile, a Google search bar remains persistent at the bottom of the menu, enabling you to search both your phone and the web at the same time. \nSimilar to the HTC U11's squeeze-sides feature, you can pinch the bezels of the Pixel 2 to summon Google Assistant. Another feature is summoning Assistant during your commute simply by declaring that you're about to drive home. The system will surface GPS directions, resume a podcast or song that was played the last time you were in the car and read out instant messages. \nGoogle received plenty of praise for the Pixel from everyone except the people who actually wanted to buy one. That's because the company has struggled to produce enough devices to cope with demand, distressing many in the Android faithful. Back in April, Android Central opined that even six months after launch, would-be purchasers were left waiting weeks, or months, for a phone. Around the same time, PhoneArena described the device as \"vaporware,\" because of the long wait times. It was enough of a problem that Osterloh even joked about it during the keynote, saying that he wished there were \"more to go around.\" \nBetween then and now, Google has, at least, bolstered its R&D division in the hope of making future devices more compelling. The company spent $1.1 billion on buying up HTC's \"Powered by HTC\" arm that was, until recently, working on Pixel devices outside Google. It wouldn't be unreasonable to hope that some of the new hires may have more experience with what's required to get a phone out the door. \nThe Google Pixel 2 will ship in a trio of colors: Kinda Blue, Just Black and Clearly White while the XL is clad in either Just Black or Black and White. Pricing for the smaller device with 64GB memory begins at $649 while the XL will initially set you back $849. Pre-orders begin today, with every user who does pre-order getting a Google Home Mini as a sweetener, although we don't know when these phones will actually ship. The company has announced that it has Verizon on hand as a launch partner, and you'll also be able to buy it on the company's own Fi network.

Save Google \nGoogle's Pixel laptop is back! Sort of. After retiring its older Pixel Chromebook this year, Google is jumping back into the premium notebook fray with the Pixelbook. (We'll leave it up to you to figure out how it came up with that name.) The big difference this time? It's a 2-in-1 machine, so it can be folded around and used like a tablet. The previous Pixels were just expensive and powerful touchscreen laptops. The Pixelbook is still pricey, though, starting at $999. Gallery: Google Pixelbook | 15 Photos 15 +11 \nWhile the idea of a premium Chromebook still doesn't make a lot of sense, the Pixelbook at least gives Google something to offer beyond the disappointing Pixel C . The company claims this is its thinnest laptop ever -- its 10-millimeter-thick frame seems reminiscent of Microsoft's slim Surface Laptop. It also weighs just 2.2 pounds, or 1 kilogram. The Pixelbook features a 12.3-inch QuadHD (1,440p) display, and it's powered by Intel Core i5 and i7 processors. You can also configure it with up to 512GB of storage and 16GB of RAM. \nAs for new features, the Pixelbook can automatically tether with your Android phone when it doesn't detect a WiFi network. Google says it can get up to 10 hours of battery life (which is standard for most ultraportables today). It also charges over USB-C, just like the Pixel C, which lets it get two hours of battery life in just 15 minutes. Google Assistant is built into the laptop, and it's accessible with voice commands and typing. \nLike the latest Chromebook models, you can install Google Play Android apps on the Pixelbook. That makes it far more useful than the past Pixel laptops, which were mainly showpieces for ChromeOS. That means you can download apps like Spotify for offline listening -- and yes, you can also view downloaded Netflix shows when you're away from the internet. Google \nThe new $99 Pixelbook Pen (sold separately) also lets you mark up the screen and get more information from Assistant. You could, for example, circle a photo with the Pen to learn more about it or highlight a word for a definition. The Pen features 2,000 levels of pressure sensitivity, and it can recognize angles up to 60 degrees. \nThe base $999 Pixelbook comes with a Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. You can bump up to a 256GB SSD for $200 more. There's also an upcoming high-end model with a Core i7 chip, 16GB of RAM and a speed 512GB NVMe SSD. Pre-orders for the Pixelbook kick off today, and they'll start shipping out in three to four weeks.

Save Alain Herzog / EPFL \nYou know what's better than one self-driving car on the road? Two, because then they can pool resources. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication isn't anything new, of course, but researchers at Switzerland's federal institute of technology, EPFL , are taking things one step further. By wirelessly connecting the LIDAR, sensors and navigation systems of two cars in convoy, both can get a fuller picture of the world around them. \nPut simply, if two autonomous vehicles are driving down a road, then all they can \"see\" is the data from their own systems. But if you can connect your car, say, to the one immediately behind you, then both systems get a wider field of view and better situational awareness. In an overtaking situation, the car behind can use its counterparts systems to scan for hazards out in front, including cars in the opposite lane. \nThe team at EPFL have worked to iron out the kinks in such a system using a pair of Citroen electric cars equipped with Mobileye sensors.

Not only was it powered by Android, it could also be used with a variety of different Daydream-compatible phones and it was covered in fabric. Today, the company announced the brand new version of the View , and this time, it comes in multiple colors: Charcoal, Fog and Coral. It's also available for $99, which is $20 more than last year's iteration. \nOne of the reasons for the higher price is that it has a wider field of view. There's also now a slot for the controller, and a removable head strap for better comfort. It measures 6.6 x 4.6 x 3.9 inches and weighs in at 9.2 ounces. Daydream-compatible phones include the newly announced Pixel 2, the older Pixel, the Galaxy S8, the S8+, the Note 8, the Moto Z, and the Moto Z2. \nGoogle also announced a lot more content that would be available on Daydream.

Save google \nIf you feel the regular Google Home is overkill when you just want to ask about the weather, you're in luck: As rumored , Google has introduced the cut-down Home Mini . For all intents and purposes, it's Mountain View's take on Amazon's Echo Dot . The puck-sized, fabric-covered device drops music-grade speakers in favor of a narrow focus on Google Assistant voice commands (including a Find My Phone feature) and, as you might imagine, a lower price to match. At $49, it's competitive with the Dot and decidedly more accessible than the standard Home. Pre-orders start now, and it ships October 19th to all seven countries where Home sells today.

Not quite: You can't plug in a wired set of speakers, so you'll have to stream to a Chromecast-enabled speaker (whether through an adapter or built-in) if you want music. You might also prefer the Echo Dot's approach to on-device playback controls. The Home Mini is certainly more fashionable, though, and it's the only real game in town if you want an always-on Google Assistant gadget at a low price.

Over the past year or so, it's introduced a new user interface , more inclusive gender options , a feature that figures out which of your photos are more appealing as well as GIFs and emoji . If you're willing to pay a little, Tinder also offers the ability to move your profile to the front of everyone's queue and see who has already liked you . Today, the app launches another way for you to communicate with other users -- Tinder Reactions. \nSome of the available Reactions include laughing emoji, applause, hearts and a bouncing \"Ball's in your court!\" tennis ball. And for incoming messages that aren't so appealing, users will have the option to send Reactions like an eye roll, a strike and a thrown martini glass. \nWhile incorporating Reactions into Tinder messaging makes sense, the company's marketing for the new feature doesn't really hit the mark. Tinder has recruited actor and comedian Whitney Cummings to promote Reactions and the campaign -- dubbed \"The Menprovement Initiative\" -- paints Reactions as a tool to combat men on the app who send unwanted messages or say inappropriate things. Reactions certainly aren't going to clean up dating sites or empower women, but if you take them for what they are -- just another way to send a message -- they're a fun addition to Tinder's features.

Save Engadget/AOL \nNow that Google is poised to have multiple Home speakers in its lineup, you're going to need a better way to manage those speakers -- and thankfully, it's already here. Google has revamped the Home app (currently just the Android version) with not only a fresh look, but support for assigning speakers to specific rooms. The tweak should make it easier to control specific speakers and even whole environments. If you want to stop music playback in the bedroom at the same time as you shut off the lights, you can issue a single command to do it all. \nThe concept of assigning speakers to rooms certainly isn't new -- it's a cornerstone of the Sonos experience. For Google, however, it's important as Home evolves into a larger product family.

The audio firm has announced support for those services as well as Pandora. AirPlay 2 won't be out until next year, but Pandora and Tidal will be available before the end of 2017. Meaning, you'll be able to control a multi-speaker system via your streaming app of choice rather than Sonos' own kludgy application.

The Sonos One Sonos One will support Alexa out of the box, but Sonos says it's open to using other voice assistants -- in fact, Google Assistant will be coming in 2018. The company says this is the first smart speaker for music lovers. It looks like a Play:1 on the outside (not a bad thing), but it has a six-microphone array to pick up your spoken commands and lighting to indicate when voice control is active. \nYou'll have access to Alexa's skills from the get-go, of course, but the big deal is that you can control playback entirely through voice if you like. You can tell the One to play music on specific Sonos speakers or throughout your entire home, for instance. And if you prefer to use apps, newly-added support for direct control and (in 2018) Apple's AirPlay 2 lets you skip Sonos' own controller software in favor of the likes of Audible, iHeartRadio or Tidal. \nThe speaker will cost $199 when it ships on October 24th, which is decidedly pricier than your typical smart speaker, but on par with the One's voiceless precursor. Sonos is clearly betting that its reputation for good sound and its experience with whole-home audio will justify a premium. The catch, of course, is that Amazon , Apple and Google aren't standing still. They're all introducing (or expected to introduce) speakers that include voice assistants and should sound pleasing to your ears, possibly with higher quality than the Sonos One. It remains to be seen whether or not Sonos' name, audio technology experience and multi-assistant support will be enough to win people over.

Save halbergman via Getty Images \nScientists have discovered an unusual magnetic behavior that could solve one of the biggest problems faced by our data-hungry world: data storage. In recent decades we've been getting progressively better at storing data but unless we find new and more efficient ways to store the increasing volume of data we're producing every day, it won't be long until data centres reach their capacities and progress grinds to a halt. The new discovery, which has the potential to store data in fast-moving magnetic particles, could remedy that. \nTraditional magnetic disks read and write data one bit at a time by altering the orientation of magnetized particles on a surface. The new concept focuses on storing data in the tiny disturbances within the magnetic orientation, called \"skyrmions\", which occur on a thin metallic film sandwiched against a different, non-magnetic metal. Electric fields in the non-magnetic layer influence the magnetic one, so the skyrmions can be controlled and manipulated, while intentionally-added defects in the magnetic layer cause the skyrmions to become pinned to specific locations. The surface then becomes a fact, efficient and controllable writing surface for data encoded in the skyrmions. \nAccording to the researchers, the system has the potential to encode data at speeds high enough to make it suitable for faster memory systems used in Random Access Memory ( RAM ), as well as a substitute for magnetic media such as hard disks . However, the team has yet to come up with an effective way of reading the data once it's been stored -- the current equipment is too expensive and complicated to be used as part of an everyday computer system. Nonetheless, the findings herald a potential step change in the way data could be stored in the future, so you don't need to worry about reigning in your data habit just yet.

Save Engadget \nGoogle was quick to brag about the original Pixel's camera prowess last year, and it's continuing with that confident stance now that the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are here. Both phones use the same 12-megapixel rear camera, and have received an unprecedented overall DxOMark test score of 98 -- that's four points higher than the previous leaders , the Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. If you ask Google, it's a combination of the hardware with its computational intelligence. \nThe key for most is that it pairs Google's existing software-based stabilization with optical stabilization -- that should lead to fewer blurry shots and less noise in low light. Rival phones tend to only use one stabilization method at a time. You can also expect quick autofocus through dual-pixel phase detection, and a portrait mode that creates DSLR-like soft backgrounds using only one camera (whether it's the back camera or the front 8-megapixel shooter). You don't need dual cams or a depth sensor here, folks. \nAs good as this sounds, though, there are some limits that Google isn't discussing. The Pixel 2 line might not need dual cameras to do portrait modes, but that also means you aren't getting optical zoom, a wide-angle lens or other perks that come with dual cams. If you're too far from a concert stage to get a good shot, it won't matter how good that one camera sensor might be. And given that the Pixel 2 phones use the same Snapdragon 835 chip as Android phones from earlier in 2017, you probably won't capture 4K video at 60 frames per second. \nThere's also the question of whether or not synthetic camera tests like this tell the whole story. While the original Pixels did end up having excellent cameras in practice, there were still flaws (for example, that lack of optical image stabilization) that didn't become fully apparent until the public got its hands on the hardware. The DxO score is a good sign, but it's worth being skeptical about Google's claims until more people have had a chance to try the Pixel 2's camera tech for themselves.

But it seems the rumors about the Pixel 2's refreshed UI were true: The Google search box has been moved to the bottom, while the top area has been devoted to widgets showing time, date, weather and the next appointment in your calendar. \nThe translucent rectangle is gone, giving you an uninterrupted view of your sweet background. Notification dots and PiP are new to Android 8.0 Oreo, but already available on the Pixel 2. In short, Google's new smartphone only made mostly iterative changes on its UI. But re-extending the former \"pill\" search tab into a full bar as well as bringing it down to the bottom returns it to the spotlight -- like Google wants to re-centralize it in the user experience. Otherwise, killing the bottom grey box and minimizing the top widget bar's text aligns with Google's trend toward cutting the cruft away for a simpler, cleaner UI.

Matt Brian, 10.04.17 \nEven though many of the devices from today's Google's Pixel 2 event had leaked beforehand, there was still plenty left to surprise. Leading the way were the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL , but we also got our first look at the Google Home Max and Mini , the 2-in-1 Pixelbook and the new wireless Pixel Buds . Some will be available in the UK soon, others will take their time to make their way across the Atlantic. Here's how much some of that new gear is going to cost you. Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL \nAs expected, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are vastly improved from last year's models. The 3.5mm headphone jack is gone, just like the iPhone, but the 5- and 6-inch smartphones feature a 2.35Ghz Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, a 12.2-megapixel sensor with a f/1.8 aperture stereo speakers, Bluetooth 5.0, and 2700 mAh and 3520 mAh batteries, respectively. \nThe pricing works out as follows. The 64GB and 128GB variants of the Pixel 2 will set you back \u00a3629 and \u00a3729 respectively. The Pixel 2 XL and Pixel 2 XL -- with the same storage -- cost a little more, coming in at \u00a3799 and \u00a3899. Pre-order one and you'll get a free Google Home Mini, too. \nPre-orders open today, with the Pixel 2 shipping by October 17th. The Pixel 2 XL, however, might take between five and six weeks to reach your doorstep. Google Home Mini and Home Max \nIf the Google Home is the search giant's answer to the Amazon Echo, the new Home Mini is its answer to the Echo Dot . The puck-sized, fabric-covered device doesn't feature the same music-grade speakers found in its bigger counterpart, opting instead to concentrate on Google Assistant voice commands. \nAs you'd expect, the Home Mini comes with a lower price tag. Should you opt for one of the three different colour variants -- chalk, red and slate -- you can expect to pay \u00a349, the same price as Amazon's Dot. You can pre-order right now and it'll ship by October 17th. \nThe Home Mini wasn't the only new speaker announced today. Instead of opting for dedicated voice smarts, Google decided it needed a speaker \"built for sound.\" The Max will automatically tune itself to your space and adjust itself depending on the song. Thanks to its dual 4.5-inch high-excursion woofers and two custom tweeters, the Max is a whopping 20 times louder than the standard Home. Given that they can also be paired in stereo, Google isn't just going after Amazon, it's also setting its sights on Sonos. \nThe Home Max will come in two colours: chalk and charcoal. However, the speaker will only be available in the US when it debuts in December. You can expect to pay around \u00a3399 when it does make its way to the UK, given the close parity between the pound and the dollar. Google Pixelbook \nIt appears Google isn't done with premium Chromebooks. The Pixelbook is a mix between the Chromebook Pixel and Pixel C , existing as a 2-in-1 machine that can be folded around and used like a tablet. The company claims the 12.3-inch device this is its thinnest laptop ever, coming in at just 10 millimetres thick. It also weighs just 2.2 pounds or 1 kilogram. \nThe Pixelbook has plenty of power too. It's powered by Intel Core i5 and i7 processors and can be configured to host up to 512GB of storage and as much as 16GB of RAM. The Pixelbook Pen can circle things on the screen and the Assistant will give you more info and links to other relevant pages. \nAt \u00a3999, the basic Pixelbook with 8GB of RAM and 128GB SSD isn't cheap, but it's not the most expensive hybrid in its category. The Core i5 model with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD is \u00a31,199 and the Core i7 model with 16GB RAM and 512GB NVMe SSD is \u00a31,699. If you want to add the pen, expect to pay \u00a399 extra. Both can be pre-ordered today and will hit stores on October 31st. Pixel Buds \nGoogle's new Pixel phones drop the headphone jack (boo), so of course the company has some Airpod-style wireless buds to go with them. The Pixel Buds will cost you \u00a3159 and come with simple touch-based gesture controls for playback and hands-free calls. They'll also give you quick access to the Google Assistant and real-time translations, which in theory sound like a godsend for frequent travellers. Like the Airpods, they'll come with their own charging case and a quick pairing feature for Android phones running Marshmallow or higher. There's currently no details on pre-orders but Google expects to begin shipping Buds from November. Google Clips \nLifelogging isn't dead, at least according to Google. Google Clips looks like any other wearable camera, but Google's crammed in a ton of its AI tech to get the most from its own. The idea is you set it somewhere (or clip it to you) and it'll \"look\" for great moments to take photos and small videos using machine learning algorithms. \nGoogle Clips is currently listed as \"coming soon\" in the US with a $249 price tag. However, it doesn't look like it'll make its debut in the UK for a while.

Save Google \nGoogle followed Apple's \"courageous\" move to eliminate the 3.5mm headphone jack on the Pixel 2 , and like the handset itself, Google designed a pair of headphones to (hopefully) best show off Assistant's capabilities. Like real-time translation so you can have a conversation with someone who speaks one of 40 foreign tongues. They're called Pixel Buds , which, let's be honest, sounds adorable . As soon as you pair them with your Pixel or Android phone running Nougat or higher, Assistant is available.

Instead, you swipe across the outside of the right earbud or tap it for things like music controls. The fabric loop should keep them securely attached to your noggin, too. Google claims you'll get five hours per-charge, and that the case the Pixel Buds come with acts as a charger and can offer around 24 hours of music. They'll run you $159, come in blue, white and black. Pre-orders open up today and they'll ship in November.

Share Save \nJust like clockwork, Google officially revealed its Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL today. And just like clockwork, Google gave the rest of the smartphone industry reason to be concerned. I spent a few moments playing with both of the new devices and couldn't help but get almost irrationally excited about them -- a rare feat considering just how thoroughly these two phones have been leaked over the past few months. My excitement has less to do with the hardware, though -- by most measures, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are exactly what you'd expect a pair of high-powered phones to be in 2017. What seems more fascinating is how good Google's Android smartphones can be because of how much control the company has over the process now. Gallery: Google Pixel 2 & Pixel 2 XL hands-on | 27 Photos 27 +23 \nLet's get the basics out of the way first: both of these phones are fast. Crazy fast. A lot of that is thanks to the ubiquitous Snapdragon 835 chipset and 4GB of RAM inside, though I'm sure the clean version of Android 8.0 certainly doesn't hurt. The commonalities don't end there either -- both are almost shockingly light, and both of their coated aluminum bodies look and feel more premium than I would've expected. If you're the kind of person who cares about \"handfeel,\" I think you'll be pleased. \nBoth phones also have Google's Active Edge, which is suspiciously similar to HTC's own Edge Sense. (I wouldn't be surprised if some of the intellectual property Google licensed from HTC relates to this.) In any case, squeezing the bottom half of the phones launches Google Assistant, which then starts listening for your commands. Assistant did a surprisingly good job at picking up queries in the journalist moshpit that was Google's demo area, but getting the phone to recognize a squeeze took more force by default than seemed comfortable. Here's hoping Google also lets us re-map that squeeze action to do other things the way Samsung didn't with Bixby and its button. \nThe cameras, meanwhile, are just fantastic. Imagine this: you're in a cramped room with questionable lighting and lots of pretty gadgets in front of you. That doesn't sound like the ideal situation for taking photos with a phone, but the 12.2-megapixel sensor working in tandem with Google's nearly insane image processing and recognition produced consistently excellent photos. I thought the Note 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus were good, and they definitely are. It's just that the Pixels seem better, even after such limited time. \nInterestingly, Google didn't spend much time today spouting off specs, which means some of the new Pixels' most useful features were barely acknowledged. Both are IP67 water and dust resistant, so they'll handle dips, spills and splashes much better than either of the existing models do. The Pixel 2s are also the first mass-market phones with integrated eSIMS, though Google didn't have the guts -- or the carrier support -- to ditch traditional SIM cards entirely. If you're a Project Fi user (T-Mobile support will come later), you'll be able to activate your plan and manage everything without fiddling with a tiny plastic card. The nanoSIM slot is there for every other carrier, and will certainly come in handy for frequent travelers. \nWhile both phones share a very powerful platform, the differences between the phones are notable. There's no way you can look at the Pixel 2 and the 2 XL and not feel some sort of visceral pull toward the latter. That's all because of its long 6.0-inch pOLED display -- it's not quite as punchy or bezel-free as other smartphones we've recently tested, but it's still far more exciting than the Pixel 2's more traditional 5-inch screen. It would've been nice of Google to bring those sweet, 18:9 screens to its smaller phone, but there's probably no way the economics would've worked out. \nTo be completely honest, I wasn't sure coming into this event that Google would be able to surprise.

Now they're starting to test their autonomous technology with folks who could be greatly empowered by autonomous vehicles: Retirees in San Jose. \ud83c\udfe0 Our first self-driving taxi service is up and running at an amazing community in San Jose. https://t.co/GcyGGUFazP \u2014 Voyage (@voyage) October 4, 2017 \nVoyage put its software and sensors into a couple modified Ford Fusion cars and began trying it out in the Villages Golf and Country Club in California, a retirement community with about 4,000 residents whose average age is 76. The gated environment is surprisingly ideal: 15 miles of roads with pedestrians, golf carts, animals and roundabouts for Voyage's autonomous vehicles to learn how to drive around -- but with a speed limit of 25 mph, The New York Times reported . \nThere's another benefit to testing in a retirement community: It's private property. That means Voyage doesn't have to share ride information with state regulators, freeing it from some bureaucracy. But testing in the community meant different obstacles, like insurers requiring Voyage to have double California's $5 million in coverage funds and to hand over all driving data. To reassure the retirement community, Voyage gave them as much equity as they give to a new hire. \nThat aside, retirees have a lot to gain from self-driving cars. Losing the ability to drive often cuts folks off from the outside world, so it's interesting to see Voyage explore where other self-driving leaders haven't been yet.

Save Engadget \nGoogle added a lot to the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL , but one of its more intriguing upgrades comes from what it's taking away: the need for a SIM card. Both devices still have a nano-SIM slot (contrary to a few rumors), but they also use eSIMs like that on the Apple Watch Series 3 . So long as your carrier supports it, you just have to download a virtual SIM during the setup process to activate service. Needless to say, that's a welcome change if you're tired of the usual SIM swapping ritual needed for upgrading handsets. \nOf course, it's that support which may be the sticking point. To no one's surprise, Google's own Project Fi is the only carrier currently lined up to support eSIMs. You'll still need to insert a regular SIM card with other networks for now, and it won't be surprising if they're hesitant to sign up. After all, this would let you easily activate or switch carriers without ordering a card or visiting a store. This is more about futureproofing the Pixel line than anything.

Share Save \nGoogle's Pixelbook is the first new laptop hardware the company has released since 2015's Chromebook Pixel 2. But that computer was only an iterative update on the original 2013 model. The Pixelbook is wildly different and reflects what we've come to expect from laptops over the last five years or so. And while the prospect of spending $1,000 or more on a Chromebook remains a stretch for just about everyone, my first impressions of the Pixelbook is that it's one of the nicest pieces of hardware I've tried in a long time. Gallery: Google Pixelbook hands-on photos | 7 Photos 7 +3 \nAt first glance, the Pixelbook is a stunner. The outside uses the same design motif as the back of the Pixel smartphones, with an aluminum and glass design that feels extremely solid. The keyboard is similarly excellent -- keys are nice and large, and I was able to type comfortably and accurately right off the bat. Some won't like the minimal travel here, but it doesn't feel quite as shallow as Apple's butterfly keyboards. Speaking of the keyboard, Google has put in some new special keys. There's now a dedicated button for the Assistant in the same spot you'd find the Windows key on a Windows laptop, and there are buttons for taking a screenshot and pulling up the settings menu in the function row. \nThe original Pixel laptop was a bit chubby and heavy even by 2013 standards, but this new model is both svelte and light (only 2.2 pounds), so much so that using it in tablet mode isn't an entirely ridiculous proposition. Especially if you put it down on a desk and use it with the $99 Pixelbook Pen. \nThe 12.3-inch touchscreen also looks great and is very responsive when you start jabbing at it with the Pen. Flipping it around into tablet mode, I got to experience the low latency when writing or drawing that Google touted. It's definitely quick -- just as responsive as the Surface Pro or iPad Pro. I didn't use it enough to make exact comparisons, but it's far better than Samsung's Chromebook Pro and its included stylus. While we're talking about tablet mode, the 360-degree hinge feels just as reliable as the rest of the hardware. \nThe UI has changed a bit here to accommodate the Google Assistant and Google Play apps, but it's pretty intuitive and should be very easy to pick up. There's an assistant button in the lower left corner of the screen and there's also a menu specifically for pen-related input. Clicking and holding a button on the pen will let you circle any part of the screen; that portion will then be dropped into Google Assistant. So if you circle a picture from a movie, you'll get more info about the film and its character. \nAs with several recent Chromebooks, Android apps are supported -- and this computer should definitely have the hardware to run them well. Google has started partnering with software developers to get apps that are designed with the Pixelbook in mind. One of those developers is Snapchat, a pretty big name for Google, but they'll need more than just that for the Android app ecosystem to really take off on Chrome OS. At the very least, things felt snappier and more responsive than ever before when trying out Android on a Chromebook. \nSpeaking of hardware, Google's offering this device in three configurations. The $999 model gets you a Core i5 processor with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. That should be more than enough for most users, but you can step up to 256GB for $1,199 or an i7 model with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $1,649. I have absolutely no idea who Google is targeting with that computer, but I'm interested in giving it a full test drive nonetheless. \nIn actuality, $999 for the level of hardware quality and performance the Pixelbook offers is right in line with what you'll find in the rest of the industry. But the question we've been asking since the first Chromebook Pixel arrived in 2013 still applies: should anyone spend that much money on a Chrome device? Google's OS has improved significantly over the years, but it still may be a hard sell -- even with such lovely and powerful hardware.

Clearly if any of the social media platforms would like to do that, we're fine with them doing it because we've already got scheduled an open hearing.

Save Chris Velazco/Engadget \nI'm not trying to gush too much, but I'm far, far more excited for the Pixel 2's camera than I thought I'd be. What's really bonkers to me, though, is that Google saw fit to squeeze its AI-powered photography tech into a cutesy 2-inch square it calls Clips. I don't think I'm alone, either: most of the people I chatted with at the event seemed at least a little perplexed by Google's ambitions here. Curiosity piqued, I had no choice but to track the thing down and have a closer look for myself. \nFirst off, I'm impressed by how much intelligence Google packed into such a petite body. By now, you probably know that Clips is capable of recognizing the people in front of it, and focuses its recording on the people (and animals) it suspects you'll be most interested in. Almost more impressive is that all of that digital legwork happens on the tiny camera itself -- it'll never tap into your phone's horsepower to fuel its computations. Years ago, that would've been impossible on anything smaller than a laptop. Now, it's all running in a package that's small enough to be unobtrusive, yet big enough to avoid being swallowed by a toddler or a cat. (Dogs might be a different story.) Gallery: Hands-on with Google Clips | 6 Photos 6 +2 \nAfter twisting the lens to turn Clips on, a 12-megapixel sensor with a 130-degree field of view does handles all the imaging. interestingly, I'm told it's optimized to play to our perceptions -- Google has worked to optimize the quality of the resulting visuals, because not everything it captures shorts bursts of video, and not all of them will be recorded at the same resolution. Even so, the images I saw captured live on a Googler's phone were more impressive than I would've thought. They're definitely not as good as the photos you'd get out of a Pixel 2, but more than good enough for blasting around your social networks. \nThose clips move around with decent speed too, since the camera maintains a connection to your phone via Wi-Fi Direct. Being in a slammed demo area with lots of interference definitely isn't ideal for connection quality, but -- after a few hiccups -- the tiny videos started showing up on the connected device pretty quickly. As such, I don't foresee too many issues when toting Clips around and trying to nab photos of loved ones on the fly. \nSo yes, on a technical level, Clips easily impresses. It's not just a camera, it's a live-in photographer (and a clever one, too). Those concerned with privacy can rest a little easier knowing none of the media Clips records will end up in the cloud somewhere unless you specifically want it to. Given that the camera is geared toward parents and pet owners, having this kind of structural silo is hugely important. What's less clear is whether this thing actually has a future -- it still very much feels like an experiment that's just helpful enough that Google decided to kick it onto the market. Only time -- and maybe a review unit -- will tell.

At $399 ($50 more than the HomePod and $100 less than the Sonos Play:5), it's priced accordingly \u2014 but at first listen, it has the chops to match up with those other speakers.

I'm no audiophile, but my first impression of the Home Max is definitely positive. It's extremely loud, well balanced and crystal clear, with well-defined bass that isn't overwhelming. In short, the sound quality is what I'd expect from a speaker in this price range \u2014 in a vacuum, it's not cheap, but it's also significantly better than the speakers most people probably have in their homes. \nThe Home Max speaker itself is exceedingly minimal. It's a large white or black slab with the same fabric covering that you'll find on the Home Mini, which Google says it designed to be transparent to audio that passes through. Like the rest of Google's home products, it should blend into most environments \u2014 though a speaker this large isn't going to be nearly as invisible as the standard Home or Amazon's new Echo. \nThat's doubly true if you get two Max speakers and pair them up. It's not a subtle setup, but it sounds simply wonderful. Of course, you'll need to be pretty serious about your home audio setup to drop $800 on a pair of these speakers. The good news is that you can hook up other devices like a turntable; they're not just limited to what you can stream. You can send songs to it via Bluetooth or Chromecast, as well. \nOther thoughtful touches include a touch strip that runs along the length of the Home's top surface. It'll mostly be used for turning volume up or down, but you can also tap to pause. The speaker is also designed to be set up horizontally or vertically, with a magnetic plastic bottom that you can move to whatever side of the speaker you need to, depending on how you set it up. (If it's in vertical mode, it only works in mono.) \nObviously, the Home Max does everything the standard Google Home does, but it also has some audio-specific features we weren't able to test out yet. Chief among those is Google's claim that the \"Smart Sound\" tech will automatically optimize audio for where you place the speaker (something that Apple says the HomePod will do, as well). We'll need to test that out, but Google says that its machine learning background will help the speaker learn exactly how it \"should\" sound in various situation, with the quality expected to improve over time. \nRegardless, it's clear Google is taking its place in the smart speaker market seriously. Whether you want multi-room audio or just one really good speaker, Google is now a legit contender.

Save Bloomberg via Getty Images \nThe wireless carrier battles have been heating up recently, as reports of a Sprint and T-Mobile merger intensify , which would allow the third and fourth largest cellular carriers in the US to better compete with the likes of giants AT&T and Verizon. But it turns out that there's another carrier to keep an eye on. Unnamed sources told Bloomberg that Comcast's wireless service, called Xfinity Mobile , has gained around 200,000 subscribers in under five months. \nIt's not a huge number of subscribers in and of itself. An analyst with Recon Analytics LLC named Roger Entner pointed out that the numbers are small (though solid growth, considering the service launched in May). \"What's interesting is that Comcast might be making a profit at this,\" Entner said to Bloomberg . \nComcast uses Verizon's wireless network and pays the company wholesale prices. Customers can only subscribe to the Xfinity Mobile plan if they already pay for Xfinity TV and Internet. Entner estimated to Bloomberg that Xfinity is paying $3\u2013$4 per gigabyte of data usage to Verizon. They're turning around and charging their customers $12 per gigabyte for that same data. Unlimited plans cost $65 per month, discounted to $45 if you subscribe to Xfinity's top-tier services. Their prices are extremely low compared to other wireless carriers, and yet it still appears they will be profitable when they reach a critical mass of customers. \nIt's certainly interesting news for the competitive cellular market in the US. Comcast can use low cell plan pricing to keep its subscribers locked into their Xfinity ecosystem, boosting profits on multiple levels. It will be interesting to see how many more subscribers they attract going forward.

Save Mat Smith, Engadget \nGoogle's most adorable product launch today is definitely its puck-size Home Mini . No more imposing cylinders with AI voices, it's much, much, smaller and just less \"tech.\" At $49, it'll square up against Amazon's Dot, but like the Dot, it will act as a gateway smart speaker for those not willing to throw down bigger sums of money. I took a look at the Home Mini at Google's satellite London event, and if other speakers left you cold, this unassuming AI speaker might win you over. Gallery: Google Home Mini: hands-on | 8 Photos 8 +4 \nGoogle's miniature version hones down last year's Home into a smaller design, but with all of the smarts. The only discernible drawback during my brief hands-on test was that sound was (understandably) less bassy and not quite as loud. I've owned a Google Home since it launched in the UK and never felt it was a replacement for my speaker system. As such, I don't really ever crank the volume to 11, and I'm betting most prospective Home Mini owners are likely to do the same. \nIf the Dot is the Home Mini's biggest rival, then Google has Amazon beat on sound quality. That's not why you'd buy one, maybe, but you'd also be getting a connected smart speaker that can play Spotify, Google Music and plenty more services -- not to mention all the connected tricks it can do with smart TVs and your smart home. \nThere's a lot to like about the design: I intentionally positioned the original Google Home alongside the Mini just to show how much smaller it is. It still looks like a Home device, but it already looks more like it'll fit into your home -- whichever room you decide to put it in. And at just under $50, it's in impulse buy territory.
