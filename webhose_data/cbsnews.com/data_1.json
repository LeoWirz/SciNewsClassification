He says the decision was made \"due to Cuba's failure to take appropriate steps to protect our diplomats.\" He's referring to unexplained attacks in Havana that have harmed at least 22 American government workers and their family members.\nTillerson says the U.S. is maintaining diplomatic relations and will cooperate with Cuba while the investigation continues. But he says his decision to withdraw 60 percent of U.S. diplomats from the embassy in Havana will remain in effect until Cuba can ensure that American diplomats there are safe.\nHe says that move is needed to \"minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm.\"\nThe move comes on the heels of last week's U.S. move to cut its own embassy staff in Havana by a similar proportion.\nA source familiar with the plans tells CBS News most of the Cuban officials asked to leave are known Cuban intelligence officers in the U.S., based in both Washington D.C. and New York. Not all of those asked to leave are \"accredited diplomats\" the American official said.\nPlay Video CBS Evening News State Department cuts staff in Cuba, issues travel warning in response to health attacks The Trump administration formalized the U.S. response to mysterious health attacks on American diplomats in Cuba.

It comes as the U.S. seeks to protect its own diplomats from unexplained attacks that have affected at least 21 Americans in Havana, in some cases harming their hearing, cognition, balance and vision.\nTillerson discussed the plan Monday with President Donald Trump.\nCuba's Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.\nPresident Raul Castro's government denies involvement in the attacks, and is likely to view the move as unwarranted retaliation. Yet U.S. officials said the goal wasn't to punish the communist-run island, but to ensure both countries have a similar number of diplomats in each other's capitals.\nPlay Video CBSN Medical records show severity of Cuba \"health attacks\" Medical records reviewed by CBS News show that some American and Canadian diplomats in Cuba were diagnosed with conditions as serious as mild tra...\nTensions between the two neighbors have been escalating amid serious U.S. concern about the unexplained attacks.\nOn Monday, The Associated Press reported that U.S. spies were among the first and most severely affected victims. Though bona fide diplomats have also been affected, it wasn't until intelligence operatives, working under diplomatic cover, reported bizarre sounds and even stranger physical effects that the United States realized something was wrong, several individuals familiar with the situation said.\nThe mysterious \"health attacks\" started within days of President Donald Trump's election in November, the AP has reported. But it wasn't until last Friday that the United States ordered more than half its embassy staff to return home.\nDelivering a one-two punch to U.S.-Cuba relations, the U.S. last week also delivered an ominous warning to Americans to stay away from Cuba, a move that could have profound implications for the island's travel industry. The U.S. said that since some workers had been attacked in Havana hotels, it couldn't assure Americans who visit Cuba that they wouldn't suffer attacks.\n\"Because our personnel's safety is at risk, and we are unable to identify the source of the attacks, we believe U.S. citizens may also be at risk and warn them not to travel to Cuba,\" the United States said in a formal travel warning.\nCuba had called that \"hasty\" and lamented that it was being taken without conclusive investigative results. But several U.S. lawmakers had said the move by Washington didn't go far enough, because President Raul Castro's government was being permitted to keep all of its diplomats in America. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., had called the one-sided action \"an insult\" in an AP interview.\nUltimately, the U.S. decided to take reciprocal action, too, bringing the two countries yet closer to the chilly state of relations they endured for decades until 2015, when they restored formal ties and re-opened embassies in Havana and Washington.\nThe U.S. previously had roughly 50 American workers at its embassy in Havana, so the 60 percent reduction will bring the figure down to roughly 20. It wasn't immediately clear how many Cuban diplomats will have to leave Washington to bring the two countries' rosters to parity.\nAt least 21 U.S. government workers in Havana and their relatives have been affected. Diagnoses include permanent hearing loss and mild traumatic brain injury.\nAlthough at first the U.S. called them \"incidents\" and avoided the word \"attacks,\" the terminology changed last week and the United States is now comfortable asserting that they were deliberate attacks that targeted Americans, officials said.\nStill, the administration has pointedly not blamed Cuba, and officials have spent weeks weighing how to minimize the risk for Americans in Cuba without unnecessarily harming relations or falling into an adversary's trap. After all, there are several countries in addition to factions of Cuba's government that would have an interest in driving a wedge between Washington and Havana.\nTwo years ago, President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro restored diplomatic ties, ordered embassies re-opened and eased travel and commerce restrictions. Trump has reversed some changes but has broadly left the rapprochement in place.\nTo medical investigators' dismay, symptoms have varied widely.

He says the decision was made \"due to Cuba's failure to take appropriate steps to protect our diplomats.\" He's referring to unexplained attacks in Havana that have harmed at least 22 American government workers and their family members.\nTillerson says the U.S. is maintaining diplomatic relations and will cooperate with Cuba while the investigation continues. But he says his decision to withdraw 60 percent of U.S. diplomats from the embassy in Havana will remain in effect until Cuba can ensure that American diplomats there are safe.\nHe says that move is needed to \"minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm.\"\nThe move comes on the heels of last week's U.S. move to cut its own embassy staff in Havana by a similar proportion.\nA source familiar with the plans tells CBS News most of the Cuban officials asked to leave are known Cuban intelligence officers in the U.S., based in both Washington D.C. and New York. Not all of those asked to leave are \"accredited diplomats\" the American official said.\nPlay Video CBS Evening News State Department cuts staff in Cuba, issues travel warning in response to health attacks The Trump administration formalized the U.S. response to mysterious health attacks on American diplomats in Cuba.

It comes as the U.S. seeks to protect its own diplomats from unexplained attacks that have affected at least 21 Americans in Havana, in some cases harming their hearing, cognition, balance and vision.\nTillerson discussed the plan Monday with President Donald Trump. \nCuba's Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.\nPresident Raul Castro's government denies involvement in the attacks, and is likely to view the move as unwarranted retaliation. Yet U.S. officials said the goal wasn't to punish the communist-run island, but to ensure both countries have a similar number of diplomats in each other's capitals.\nPlay Video CBSN Medical records show severity of Cuba \"health attacks\" Medical records reviewed by CBS News show that some American and Canadian diplomats in Cuba were diagnosed with conditions as serious as mild tra... \nTensions between the two neighbors have been escalating amid serious U.S. concern about the unexplained attacks.\nOn Monday, The Associated Press reported that U.S. spies were among the first and most severely affected victims. Though bona fide diplomats have also been affected, it wasn't until intelligence operatives, working under diplomatic cover, reported bizarre sounds and even stranger physical effects that the United States realized something was wrong, several individuals familiar with the situation said.\nThe mysterious \"health attacks\" started within days of President Donald Trump's election in November, the AP has reported. But it wasn't until last Friday that the United States ordered more than half its embassy staff to return home.\nDelivering a one-two punch to U.S.-Cuba relations, the U.S. last week also delivered an ominous warning to Americans to stay away from Cuba, a move that could have profound implications for the island's travel industry. The U.S. said that since some workers had been attacked in Havana hotels, it couldn't assure Americans who visit Cuba that they wouldn't suffer attacks.\n\"Because our personnel's safety is at risk, and we are unable to identify the source of the attacks, we believe U.S. citizens may also be at risk and warn them not to travel to Cuba,\" the United States said in a formal travel warning.\nCuba had called that \"hasty\" and lamented that it was being taken without conclusive investigative results. But several U.S. lawmakers had said the move by Washington didn't go far enough, because President Raul Castro's government was being permitted to keep all of its diplomats in America. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., had called the one-sided action \"an insult\" in an AP interview.\nUltimately, the U.S. decided to take reciprocal action, too, bringing the two countries yet closer to the chilly state of relations they endured for decades until 2015, when they restored formal ties and re-opened embassies in Havana and Washington.\nThe U.S. previously had roughly 50 American workers at its embassy in Havana, so the 60 percent reduction will bring the figure down to roughly 20. It wasn't immediately clear how many Cuban diplomats will have to leave Washington to bring the two countries' rosters to parity.\nAt least 21 U.S. government workers in Havana and their relatives have been affected. Diagnoses include permanent hearing loss and mild traumatic brain injury.\nAlthough at first the U.S. called them \"incidents\" and avoided the word \"attacks,\" the terminology changed last week and the United States is now comfortable asserting that they were deliberate attacks that targeted Americans, officials said.\nStill, the administration has pointedly not blamed Cuba, and officials have spent weeks weighing how to minimize the risk for Americans in Cuba without unnecessarily harming relations or falling into an adversary's trap. After all, there are several countries in addition to factions of Cuba's government that would have an interest in driving a wedge between Washington and Havana.\nTwo years ago, President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro restored diplomatic ties, ordered embassies re-opened and eased travel and commerce restrictions. Trump has reversed some changes but has broadly left the rapprochement in place.\nTo medical investigators' dismay, symptoms have varied widely. In addition to hearing loss and concussions, some people have experienced nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. The Associated Press has reported that some now suffer from problems with concentration and common word recall.\nThe incidents stopped for a time.

His final minutes were spent in the arms of a total stranger who never left his side, reports CBS News' Adriana Diaz. \n\"It's what you see on TV and it's never going to be you. It's never going to happen to you. And it was happening,\" said Heather Gooze. She was working as a bartender at the concert and escaped the gunfire. \nBut McIldoon who, according to his Facebook page, lived in Canada and worked in construction, did not. He was among the seriously wounded Gooze held. \n\"His fingers were kind of wrapped on my hand. His hand kind of squeezed a little bit, and then just, like, went loose,\" Gooze said. \nGooze was able to call McIldoon's girlfriend who was sheltering in place nearby. \nJordan McIldoon and girlfriend \n\"She said, 'Be honest with me, like, what's going on?' And I said 'He didn't make it.' She said to me, 'You know, he's the love of my life, like, are you sure?' I said, 'Yes.'\" \nThere were dozens of stories like McIldoon's Sunday night. People with little in common except for being caught in the crosshairs of a killer. \nSonny Melton of Tennessee reportedly was running with his wife to safety when he was shot and killed. \nCharleston Hartfield was a 34-year-old Las Vegas police officer off-duty at the time of the shooting. \nAngela Gomez was a cheerleader from California. \nRachel Parker worked for the police department in Manhattan Beach, California. \nTeacher Sandy Casey was remembered by her partner as a woman who, \"Lived life to the fullest and made me the happiest man in the world.\" \n\"I'm connected to him now my whole life,\" Gooze said of McIldoon. She stayed with his body for more than four hours. \n\"I would hope somebody would do it for me.

It proves another part of Albert Einstein's theory o... \n\"The best comparison is when Galileo discovered the telescope, which allowed us to see that Jupiter had moons and all of a sudden we discovered that the universe was much vaster than we used to think about. With this discovery we can study processes which were completely impossible, out of reach to us in the past,\" said Ariel Goobar of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nWith the technology that the three developed \"We may even see entirely new objects that we haven't even imagined yet,\" said Patrick Sutton, an astronomer at Cardiff University in Wales.\nWeiss, in a phone call with the announcement news conference at the Swedish academy, said \"I view this more as a thing that recognizes the work of a thousand people.\"\nGravitational waves are extremely faint ripples in the fabric of space and time, generated by some of the most violent events in the universe.\nThe waves detected by the laureates came from the collision of two black holes some 1.3 billion light-years away. A light-year is about 5.88 trillion miles.\nThe waves were predicted by Einstein a century ago as part of his theory of general relativity. General relativity says that gravity is caused by heavy objects bending space-time, which itself is the four-dimensional way that astronomers see the universe.\nThe German-born Weiss was awarded half of the 9-million-kronor ($1.1 million) prize amount and Thorne and Barish will split the other half.\nWeiss in the 1970s designed a laser-based device that would overcome background noise that would disturb measurements of gravitational waves. He, Thorne and Barish \"ensured that four decades of effort led to gravitational waves finally being observed,\" the Nobel announcement said.\nThe announcement said Einstein was convinced that gravitational waves could never be measured. The laureates used laser devices \"to measure a change thousands of times smaller than an atomic nucleus.\"\nIn a moment of poetry aimed at making the distant and infinitesimal phenomenon understandable to non-experts, the academy announcement said gravitational waves \"are always created when a mass accelerates, like when an ice-skater pirouettes or a pair of black holes rotate around each other.\"\nFor the past 25 years, the physics prize has been shared among multiple winners.\nLast year's prize went to three British-born researchers who applied the mathematical discipline of topology to help understand the workings of exotic matter such as superconductors and superfluids. In 2014, a Japanese and a Canadian shared the physics prize for studies that proved that the elementary particles called neutrinos have mass.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "einstein", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "patrick sutton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barry barish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weiss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kip thorne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thorne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainer weiss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ariel goobar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert einstein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "massachusetts institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal academy of sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal swedish academy of sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galileo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardiff university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "stockholm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jupiter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:26:52.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "80c7db902d21f64568db94c6d2fc30610fb20701", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTaVuehfv1I7bzrCdTrj_8gZydpLmjMLqwx90.9rtjsMv8fCPDVk5Ek_x4ESlu6nra22R8XKqh7XTlHp2WETAqi25OwOIqQc65.8ciYqEahBw--", "site_full": "www.cbsnews.com", "site": "cbsnews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.cbsnews.com/CBSNewsMain?format=xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Home - CBSNews.com", "title": "Eye Opener: Search for answers after Vegas shooting", "title_full": "Eye Opener: Search for answers after Vegas shooting", "published": "2017-10-03T14:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/03/05656c0b-227a-46a8-ac5a-681756327b34/thumbnail/1200x630/5847aff01ece2edcad59c070beefbfcb/1003-ctm-7ameyeopener-1410277-640x360.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 584, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "80c7db902d21f64568db94c6d2fc30610fb20701", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTaVuehfv1I7bzrCdTrj_8gZydpLmjMLqwx90.9rtjsMv8fCPDVk5Ek_x4ESlu6nra22R8XKqh7XTlHp2WETAqi25OwOIqQc65.8ciYqEahBw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T14:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Eye Opener: Search for answers after Vegas shooting", "text": "Eye Opener: Search for answers after Las Vegas shooting October 3, 2017, 7:00 AM | Americans mourn the Las Vegas shooting victims and ask why an accountant-turned-gambler killed 59 people and wounded more than 500.

More than 58 people are dead and more than 400 people were wounded. \nWhile it's unclear how the deceased gunman, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, obtained the weapons he used, Nevada has fairly lax gun laws. Fully automatic weapons are legal in the state as well as in some other states, reports CBS News' Don Dahler, although they are heavily regulated by the federal government. \nIn Nevada, dealers must have a Class-III license and anyone interested in owning such firearms must submit an an application to local police, undergo a federal background check, and pay a $200 fee. No fully automatic weapons made after May 19, 1986 may be legally sold or owned, Dahler reports, and so the weapons themselves are both old and much more expensive than other firearms. They also must be registered with the federal government. Ron Hosko, CBS News security analyst and former assistant director of the FBI, joins CBSN to discuss what investigators are doing in the aftermat... \nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California conveyed that message in a letter Monday to Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, by calling for the creation of a Select Committee on Gun Violence. \n\"Today, our nation woke up to news of the worst mass shooting in our history, claiming the lives of at least 58 innocent men and women in Las Vegas. Nearly 12,000 Americans have been killed by guns in 273 mass shootings in 2017 \u2013 one for each day of the year,\" she wrote. \"I urge you to create a Select Committee on Gun Violence to study and report back common sense legislation to help end this crisis.\" \nPresident Trump campaigned last year defending Americans' Second Amendment rights and against Hillary Clinton's agenda to tighten gun laws. Earlier this year, with the help of the GOP-controlled Congress, Mr. Trump reversed a rule finalized in the last days of the Obama administration that was part of the implementation of a 2008 law that Congress passed in the aftermath of the Virginia Tech shooting. The rule would have allowed the Social Security Administration to provide information to the gun background check system of people who have so severe a mental disability that they can't perform any kind of work and can't manage their own benefits. \nRepublicans not only have the ability to roll some of these rules back, but they could seek to loosen some gun laws. Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-South Carolina, for example, is trying to revive a measure that would make it easier to purchase gun silencers. He says that they are used by target shooters and hunters to protect their hearing. Even if it were to pass the House, it's unclear if it could clear the 60-vote threshold in the Senate. \nA CBS News survey from June 2016 found that 54 percent at the time wanted stricter laws covering gun sales, 33 percent wanted them to be kept as they are and 11 percent wanted them to be less strict. \nWith the GOP in the majority, Congress is unlikely to consider gun control measures any time soon. \nHere are some of the major gun bills Congress has passed, considered or pushed for consideration in recent years, usually in the wake of mass shootings: 2016: Barring those on terror watchlists from purchasing firearms \nIn June 2016, after 49 people were killed in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, Democrats pushed legislation nicknamed \"no-fly, no-buy\" that would allow the FBI to bar firearm sales to people on the agency's terrorist watchlists and one that would expand background checks ahead of gun purchases. The no-fly, no-buy proposals failed in the Senate and never came to a vote in the House even though 86 percent of voters backed such legislation, according to a Quinnipiac University poll at the time. \nDuring the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump indicated that he was in favor of \"no-fly, no-buy\" legislation. \nFailed in Senate 2015: Expanding background checks, mental health treatment \nA day after 14 people were killed in San Bernardino, California in Dec. 2015, the Senate rejected a series of gun control bills . One would have strengthened treatment for mental illness and substance abuse disorders. Another was the no-fly, no-buy proposal and the other would have expanded background checks for guns purchased online or at gun shows. The Senate previously voted down that last bill, offered by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia and Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, in 2013. \nFailed in Senate 2015: Repealing funding ban on gun violence research \nCoincidentally, Democrats had planned on the day of the San Bernardino shooting to lobby lawmakers, along with physician advocates, to reverse a funding ban on gun violence research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that has been in place for nearly 20 years. \nFailed in House 2013: Renewing federal ban on plastic guns \nCongress renewed a ban, dating back to 1988 that was set to expire, on plastic firearms that could go undetected in X-ray machines or by metal detectors. It's the last major gun-related bill that has been signed into law in recent years. \nSigned into law 2013: Expanding background checks and limits on size of magazines \nFour months after the Newtown massacre that left 26 people -- children and school staff members -- dead, the Senate considered the Manchin-Toomey measure. It was a bipartisan amendment that would have required background checks on all commercial gun sales, but it failed by only a few votes in the Senate . Lawmakers rejected it in a 54-46 vote. They wanted to attach the amendment a bill that would have tightened security in schools and cracked down on gun trafficking. Amendments that would have banned high-capacity clips or limited the size of magazines to 10 clips also failed. \nFailed in Senate 2011: Closing the gun show loophole and banning high capacity magazines \nNot long after the January shooting in Tucson that left six dead and seriously wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, longtime gun control advocate Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-New York, introduced a bill in the House to ban high-capacity ammunition magazines to a maximum of 10 rounds and would close a loophole in the assault weapons ban that had expired in which magazines made before the law took effect could still be sold or transferred. Similarly, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, introduced the same 10-round magazine measure in the Senate along with two other bills that would have required sellers at gun shows to perform the same background checks that licensed gun dealers must conduct and one that was no-fly, no-buy. \nNot considered 2008: Preventing the severely mentally ill from buying guns \nIn the wake of the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre that left 32 people dead, President Bush signed into law in January 2008 a measure the Democratic-controlled Congress passed a few weeks earlier in December that expanded the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System and required agencies to keep up-to-date records on people with mental illnesses or felons. \nSigned into law 2004: Effort to renew the assault weapons ban \nThe law that President Clinton signed into law 10 years earlier that banned the manufacture, use, import and possession of 19 types of assault weapons expired. Democrats on Capitol Hill tried to renew it, but were unsuccessful with a Republican-controlled White House and Congress. \nNot considered \nCBS News' Andres Triay contributed to this report. \u00a9 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
