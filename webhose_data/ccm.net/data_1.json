(CCM) \u2014 Apple has rushed out yet another update to its bug-riddled iOS 11, just a week after the previous bug-fixing update. iOS 11.0.2 , released on Tuesday, fixes a flaw in the software which causes a crackling noise during some calls made on brand new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus handsets. It also fixes another flaw which resulted in some photos in iPhones' and iPads' camera rolls being invisible, and it squashes a bug which made it impossible to open some attachments in S/MIME-encrypted emails. It is not yet known whether the update also fixes the poor battery life that many users have reported since upgrading to iOS 11. Last week Apple was forced to release the iOS 11.0.1 update after it was discovered that Microsoft Exchange and Outlook.com users running iOS 11 were unable to synchronise their email accounts or send email using the operating system's own Mail app. It also introduced performance improvements for various apps and made some minor fixes to the Camera and Photos apps to make them work more effectively with older iPhones. Apple has already begun testing a version of iOS 11.1 \u2014 yet another update to the problem-hit operating system \u2014 which is expected to be released in the near future.

(CCM) \u2014 Instagram has copied Snapchat 's Polly add-on by introducing an interactive poll sticker to Instagram Stories. The sticker lets users add a simple question to a picture or video and offers two answers for friends and followers to choose between. The answers default to Yes and No, but they can be customized to any alternative answers. Once a Story featuring a poll sticker has been published, friends and followers can start voting and see the results in real time. Once someone places their vote, they can immediately see which choice is the most popular. By viewing the story again they will also be able to see the latest results. Users can see the results of their own polls by swiping up to open the viewers list for that part of the story. This will reveal who has voted and which option they selected. Polls and their results will disappear along with the story after 24 hours. Instagram has also launched new Photoshop-like tools to help choose colors for text and brushes and an alignment tool for text and stickers. The new pipette allows users to select any color from a photo or video, and in iOS blue guide lines appear when positioning text or a sticker to make it easier to center.

Translation is activated by touching and holding the right ear bud, and words spoken by another person are translated and played directly into the wearer's ears by the ear buds. The wearer can also speak in their own language and a translation will play through the speakers of the wearer's connected Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL phone. Touch controls on the earbuds also allow the wearer to play or pause music and summon Google Assistant. The Pixel Buds are supplied in a charging case that offers a total battery life of about 24 hours, with five hours of continuous operation between charges.

The Sonos One, announced on Wednesday, will launch on October 24, 2017 with Amazon's Alexa intelligent assistant providing full voice support for Amazon Music, iHeartRadio, Pandora, SiriusXM, and TuneIn. Support for Spotify will be added soon after launch. In 2018 Sonos will add support for Google Assistant, making it the first connected speaker to support multiple intelligent assistants. Using voice commands, users can select, pause and skip songs, and change the volume on every Sonos system in the home. They can also use Alexa (and later Google Assistant) to carry out other tasks such as reading the news, providing a weather forecast, or dimming the lights. The Sonos One is equipped with two digital amplifiers, one tweeter, and one mid\u2014woofer. It has a six-mic array and runs an adaptive noise suppression algorithm enabling it to focus on spoken commands. It also features voice capture technology with echo cancelation to allow the speaker to hear commands even when music is playing.

The blue coloring harks back to the days when ThinkPads were made by IBM, before the company sold its computer hardware division and the ThinkPad brand to Lenovo in 2005. However, beneath the retro exterior lies a powerful modern laptop computer. The ThinkPad 25 is equipped with a 7th generation Core i7 processor, Windows 10 Pro, a 512 GB SSD, and an Nvidia GeForce GT 940MX 2GB graphics card. It features Dolby Audio for high quality sound reproduction and a 14-inch touchscreen display. The laptop has a battery life up to 13.9 hours, the company claims. It also includes Intel Thunderbolt 3 \u2014 a technology which offers data throughput at up to 40 Gbps via the laptop's USB-C port when connected to a Thunderbolt 3-enabled device. It also allows the laptop to output to two 4K displays through a Thunderbolt dock. The 25th anniversary ThinkPad 25 is available today, priced at $1,899.

(CCM) \u2014 Apple is facing the prospect of an iPhone 8 sales meltdown following reports that some units in the Far East have popped open due to the battery swelling. The company will be keen to avoid a repeat of the debacle surrounding Samsung's Galaxy Note8 handset, which had to be scrapped last year after the batteries in a small number of units exploded. Reuters has reported that a Chinese man's iPhone 8 Plus cracked open before the unit had been charged, and similar cases have been reported in Taiwan and Japan. A photo from China shows the phone split along the side with the sim tray, with internal parts visible. An Apple spokesperson said that the company is looking into the matter, according to the Reuters report. Apple's shares have slid since the launch of the iPhone 8, which has been met with lukewarm reviews. Pre-orders for the device are likely to be well down on previous model launches, although that may be due to customers waiting for the premium iPhone X which is not due to launch until November 2017.

(CCM) \u2014 Microsoft has finally admitted that it sees no future for Windows Phone and has started the process of mothballing the troubled mobile operating system. The move leaves the company's plans to be a rival to Apple and Google in the mobile space in tatters. Joe Belfiore, a Microsoft vice-president and long-time Windows Phone evangelist, broke the news in a series of tweets. He recommended that Windows Phone users switch to Android , iOS, or anything else that meets their needs. \"Of course we'll continue to support the platform.. bug fixes, security updates, etc. But building new features/hw aren't the focus,\" he said , rounding off the tweet with a sad face. Belfiore attributed the operating system's failure to the fact that many key apps were unavailable on it, which deterred many people from trying it. This in turn made deterred developers from working on apps for Windows Phone. He admitted that in a private capacity he had already abandoned the operating system and uses an alternative, although he did not specify which one. \"We have tried VERY HARD to incent app devs. Paid money.. wrote apps 4 them.. but volume of users is too low for most companies to invest,\" he explained, adding another sad face. He said that instead of encouraging Windows Phone development, Microsoft will continue to develop its own apps for other mobile operating systems.

(CCM) \u2014 Retro-gaming enthusiasts are celebrating that the new SNES Classic Edition game console has been hacked, enabling owners to add additional titles to the 21 games that the console is supplied with, Tech Times is reporting . Owners can now download a software tool called Hackchi2 and run it on a PC, with the SNES Classic Edition connected using a USB cable. After following the instructions the console should be \"unlocked,\" enabling extra games to be installed. The console may be able to hold up to 63 games, and there are hundreds that have been confirmed to work on unlocked consoles. These include classic titles such as Earthworm Jim and Donkey Kong Country. Demand for the console is likely to increase now that it can be unlocked, and it is already in short supply. But Nintendo has promised to ramp up production to try to ensure that it can fulfill demand in the run-up to the holiday season.

Cortana will now be able to help users with video calls and present users with useful suggestions based on their chats. For example, Cortana can suggest users nearby eateries, landmarks, and even smart replies based on their chats. It can also set up reminders and schedule events during conversations. Users will also be able to have one-on-one chats with Cortana in Skype, with the virtual assistant showing up in their contacts. Explaining the integration, Microsoft said , \"In addition to being your 'behind-the-scenes' assistant, Cortana is also a contact in Skype. So now, you can have natural conversations in one-on-one chats with Cortana.\"The integration has currently only rolled out in the U.S. to both Android and iOS platforms.

(CCM) \u2014 LG Electronics announced on Tuesday its preliminary earnings for Q3. According to the information released, the operating profit of the company is speculated to jump to 82.2% YoY, while the revenue may rise to 15.2%, despite the company\u2019s registering losses in its mobile division. In an official statement, LG has predicted an operating profit of KRW516.1 billion ($452 million) in Q3 2017. This is an increase from the KRW283.2 billion in Q3 2016. Additionally, total revenue for Q3 2017 is expected to rise to KRW15.2 trillion from KRW13.2 trillion in the same quarter of 2016. Comparatively, analysts believe that LG's mobile division may post a loss of KRW200 billion for Q3 2017, which will mark its tenth quarterly loss in a row. It is no secret that LG's mobile unit has not been faring well for quite some time: its sales performance has been low in Q2, especially for flagships and smartphone shipments fell 4%.

(CCM) \u2014 Google's recently announced Google Home Mini smart speaker has gotten into trouble before even going on sale. A bug has been found in the calibration of the touch sensors on top of the device, causing it to begin recording without prompt. These faulty sensors can be found on the first units of the Google Home Mini, and these were the units that were handed over to the reviewers at Google\u2019s Pixel event October 4, 2017. Like the company\u2019s other voice-activated assistants, the Google Home Mini also responds to keywords like \"OK, Google\" or \"Hey, Google.\" But the bug on Google Home Mini was listening to more than the trigger words. According to one writer, Artem Russakovskii of Android Police , the review unit that he received had saved thousands of recordings. Google was quick to respond to the issue and has already dispatched a software update for the Home Mini to fix the bug as well as documentation to reflect the change. The update brings the smart device to software version 1.28.100122 and disables the touchpad on top.

(CCM) \u2014 Despite a slew of claims of end-to-end encryption and privacy protection, WhatsApp has suffered a privacy breach. The bug, discovered by software engineer Robert Heaton , allows users to be snooped on, having their online statuses revealed without their knowledge. While concerning, the issue only allows others to study user chatting patterns. It does not allow outsiders to access private messages and other private information. Additionally, this breach is only possible when the third party is added to the user\u2019s contact list. Until an update is released, there is nothing that a user can do to stop someone from monitoring their activity. While WhatsApp does offer an option to disable the \u201cLast Seen at\u201d feature, there is no way to disable the \u201cOnline Status\u201d feature. Such a vulnerability may not be of much use to a stalker, but for advertising companies, this information is a gold mine because it can help them target users according to their activity patterns.

Although early reports suggested that HMD Global \u2014 Nokia\u2019s parent company \u2014 had a U.S. launch for the device in the works, the company confirmed on Thursday that this would not be the case.

(CCM) \u2014 On Thursday, Oculus announced that a new VR headset, the Oculus Go, would be joining its product lineup. The Oculus Go is a standalone VR headset, and it, therefore, does not need to be paired to a phone to work. The device comes already outfitted with many of the same games that can be found pre-loaded on Samsung\u2019s Gear VR device. For seamless gaming, the Oculus Go comes with a single motion controller that has no touch or trigger controls. The device has been priced at $200 and will go on sale in early 2018. It features a higher resolution than the Oculus Rift VR headset, at 2560x1200 pixels. However, because the Oculus Go only supports smartphone games, user should not expect to get the top-end graphics seen in PC games. Unlike many other VR headsets, the Oculus Go is portable, as it is equipped with built-in speakers. This new device will be a rival for Samsung\u2019s Gear and Google's Daydream devices; how strong of a rival is unclear, as both competing products are priced lower than the Oculus Go, at $100. In the same announcement, the company also revealed that its classic Oculus VR headset had received a permanent price cut to $400.

(CCM) \u2014 Apple is miles ahead of Android when it comes to uniform distribution of its latest software versions. iOS 11 , released just three weeks ago, has already managed to obtain a 47% download rate on Apple devices and is now the most used OS version on Apple's mobile devices. According to a report by analytics firm Mixpanel , iOS 11 currently runs on 47% devices, one percent more than iOS 10\u2019s figure. The uptake rate of Android\u2019s latest OS, Oreo, pales in comparison, with barely 0.2% of total devices running it. Following iOS 11, Apple released v11.0.1, v11.0.2, and v11.0.3 to resolve bugs in iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 devices. While these are just incremental updates, a major update packed with new features is expected to be released as iOS 11.1.

(CCM) \u2014 In a shocking turn of events, Samsung Electronics' CEO, Kwon Oh-hyun, has announced his plan to resign from all current roles in March 2018. Kwon informed company employees about the major decision in a letter . \"It is something I had been thinking long and hard about for quite some time. It has not been an easy decision, but I feel I can no longer put it off,\" he wrote. In addition to Samsung Electronics, Kwon is the CEO of Samsung Display. The letter sent by Kwon cites \u201cunprecedented crisis\u201d at the company as the reason behind his resignation. Kwon continued, \"As we are confronted with unprecedented crisis inside out, I believe that time has now come for the company start anew, with a new spirit and young leadership to better respond to challenges arising from the rapidly changing IT industry.\"Crisis struck at Samsung following the 5-year jail sentence handed down to Samsung Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong on corruption charges. Samsung, which currently has two other CEOs heading different divisions, has yet to announce who will be replacing Kwon.

(CCM) \u2014 A massive flaw has been discovered in the encryption system which is used to secure most Wi-Fi systems, allowing hackers to steal credit card numbers, passwords, chat messages, emails, and photos, using a technique called a Key Reinstallation Attack or KRACK. In some circumstances a KRACK can also be used to manipulate data as it travels over the Wi-Fi network, or to inject ransomware or other malware into websites, according to Mathy Vanhoef , the security researcher who revealed the flaw. The flaw lies in the WPA2 security protocol used in homes and businesses, so any devices which use WPA2 correctly \u2014 including Android, Apple, Windows, and Linux devices, as well as most routers \u2014 are affected. Devices running Linux or Android 6.0 or later are particularly vulnerable to a KRACK, and a hacker should be able to decrypt all the data that victims using these devices transmit relatively easily. Other devices are harder to attack so successfully, but a hacker can expect to be able to decrypt a significant amount of the data transmitted by the victim. To prevent hackers from carrying out a KRACK, users must update their devices as soon as security updates are made available by the manufacturers, Vanhoef said.

(CCM) \u2014 Up to 20,000 players are being banned from PlayerUnknown's \"battle royale\" genre combat game Battlegrounds every day, according to BattlEye , a company that detects and ejects cheats from multi-player online games. BattlEye said that it usually detects between 6,000 and 13,000 cheats in Battlegrounds on any given day using its anti-cheat technology, but last Saturday it ejected 20,000 players who had hacked their systems to give themselves an unfair advantage over other players and banned them all. The vast majority of the cheats come from China, where hacking systems in this way is popular, the company added. Common cheats such as \"aimbots\" allow players to shoot more accurately by targeting specific colors on the screen, while more sophisticated cheats allow people to find hidden loot and see where other players are hiding. Many players are put off participating in games if there are large numbers of cheats because they are at such a disadvantage, so game companies employ technologies such as BattlEye's which can detect software that has been hacked, in order to combat the problem. Simple cheat tools are generally freely available, but more effective cheats can cost hundreds of dollars to buy or to subscribe to on a monthly basis.

(CCM) \u2014 Garmin has teamed up with Amazon to produce an Echo -like device that provides turn-by turn-navigation in cars. The Garmin Speak with Amazon Alexa has a small OLED screen that displays arrows to tell the driver which way to go, and an LED ring which glows green shortly before a turn is required. Navigation instructions are played through the car's entertainment system via a Bluetooth or AUX connection, and the device affixes to the car windshield using a magnetic mount. Users control the device by providing voice instructions to Alexa, such as \"Alexa, ask Garmin to provide directions to the nearest gas station,\" or \"Alexa, ask Garmin to find some barbeque.\" Users can also use Alexa in the same way that they would on an Echo device: to ask for a news briefing, to remotely access smart home automation devices such as lights, locks, and thermostats, or to play music from streaming services such as Amazon music. In addition, the device can be used to accept or ignore incoming calls, which are then played through the car's entertainment system. The Garmin Speak with Amazon Alexa uses a data connection from a paired smartphone running the free Garmin Speak app, and can be ordered through Amazon or Best Buy for $149.99.

(CCM) \u2014 Facebook has locked its sights on teens around the world with the purchase of tbh , a polling app that has been a huge hit with under-twenties. Billed as \"the only anonymous app with positive vibes,\" the app lets users create anonymous polls in which friends can participate. The app generates positive and kind-hearted poll topics, such as \"has the most integrity,\" or \"best shoulder to cry on,\" and then selects four people from a user's uploaded contacts to select from. Poll winners receive the poll results as compliments, consistent with the app's strapline: \"See who likes you.\"Tbh has generated more than 1 billion poll answers since its launch this summer, and the app has been downloaded over 5 million times, according to the company. The service will continue to run as a separate app to Facebook, but the app's founders will become Facebook employees after the purchase is complete. This suggests that tbh's widely recognized name and distinctive style persuaded Facebook that it would be better off buying tbh than trying to clone its functionality \u2013 something that Facebook's coders could easily do in a very short space of time.

(CCM) \u2014 A massive flaw has been discovered in the encryption system which is used to secure most WiFi systems, allowing hackers to steal credit card numbers, passwords, chat messages, emails, and photos, using a technique called a Key Reinstallation Attack or KRACK. In some circumstances a KRACK can also be used to manipulate data as it travels over the WiFi network, or to inject ransomware or other malware into websites, according to Mathy Vanhoef , the security researcher who revealed the flaw. The flaw lies in the WPA2 security protocol used in homes and businesses, so any devices which use WPA2 correctly \u2014 including Android, Apple, Windows, and Linux devices, as well as most routers \u2014 are affected. Devices running Linux or Android 6.0 or later are particularly vulnerable to a KRACK, and a hacker should be able to decrypt all the data that victims using these devices transmit relatively easily. Other devices are harder to attack so successfully, but a hacker can expect to be able to decrypt a significant amount of the data transmitted by the victim. To prevent hackers from carrying out a KRACK, users must update their devices as soon as security updates are made available by the manufacturers, Vanhoef said.

(CCM) \u2014 Google's Calendar web app had begun to look increasingly tired and out-of-date, but today it has been given a refreshing new look and small selection of new features, the company has announced . The new design is based heavily on Google's mobile Calendar app, and features larger, more prominent dates, an updated color palette, and a responsive layout that automatically adjusts to the size of the user's screen. To access the new-look Google Calendar, non-business users need to open the web app and then click on the \"Use new Calendar\" link which appears in the top right hand corner of the Calendar screen. The new features can be accessed by all Calendar users, but they will mainly appeal to corporate users. For example, administrators can now enter detailed information about an organization's meeting rooms, so employees know where a conference room is located, how large it is, and whether it has audio/video equipment or is wheelchair accessible, according to Lars Kr\u00fcger, Google's product manager for Google Calendar. It is also now possible to view multiple calendars in \"Day\" view side-by-side. This makes it easier for employees who manage multiple calendars, like administrative assistants, to schedule meetings on behalf of their teams, Kr\u00fcger says.

(CCM) \u2014 WhatsApp has launched a new live location sharing feature that makes it easy to see where friends are at any moment in time. The Facebook-owned company is touting the new capability as a safety feature so that friends or family can see that users get home safely after an evening out and as a way to help co-ordinate meeting up with groups of friends. The functionality is similar to that offered by Apple's Find My Friends app, but WhatsApp's take on it allows users to control how long their location is shared. That means that they can set it to share their location for a few hours or a whole evening and let it expire automatically, or they can stop location sharing at any time by switching it off manually in the app. To activate the feature, users open a chat with a person or group of people. Under \"Location\" in the attach button there is a new option to \"Share Live Location.\" After choosing how long they want to share and tapping send, each person in the chat will be able to see the user's real-time location on a map. The new feature is available on iOS and Android and will be rolled out to WhatsApp users in an update in the next few weeks.

(CCM) \u2014 Nintendo has given its Switch game console a huge feature boost with the latest firmware update. Version 4.0.0 , released today, lets users record gameplay video and store it in an album. The video can then be edited and shared on Facebook or Twitter. The new feature works with selected games including The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Arms, and Spaltoon 2, with support for more games to be added in the future. The new firmware also allows users to migrate games, users, and saved game data to another Switch console. The migration is meant to be permanent, and Nintendo warns that \"once the process is complete, the user information, the associated saved data, and the software purchased with the user account that is transferred will no longer be available on the source console.\"The update also offers other minor new enhancements including new profile icons featuring characters from the Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild games, as well as the ability to pre-purchase certain games on the Nintendo eShop for Nintendo Switch. The update will be automatically downloaded to Switch consoles when they are connected to the Internet. Users are then asked to click on an \"Update\" button to install the software and restart the console.

(CCM) \u2014 Samsung is targeting 3D content enthusiasts with a high-end camera that can create 360-degree content in at a resolution of 4K. The Samsung 360 Round , unveiled on Wednesday at the Samsung Developer Conference in San Francisco, has no less than 17 2 MP cameras which can record 3D, virtual reality, and 360-degree 4K videos and stream them at 30 frames per second. The camera is equipped with 10 GB of RAM and 40 GB of internal storage and can be connected to an external SSD device with up to 2 TB of storage using an Ethernet or USB-C connection. The 360 Round is also IP65 water and dust resistant for use outside in bad weather or rugged terrain. The camera is vastly more capable than Samsung's entry-level Gear 360 camera, which retails for $229. This is reflected in the Samsung 360 Round's price-tag: it will be available in the U.S. in late October 2017 priced at $10,500. To process video from the device, users will also need a powerful computer equipped with an Intel Core i7-6700K chip and a Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU. For live streaming users will need a 10-core i7 6950XC chip and two of these Nvidia GPUs.

(CCM) \u2014 Facebook is offering a way for desktop users to get out of a newsfeed rut. It is offering a new type of newsfeed that uses an alternative algorithm to select posts for inclusion, according to a Tech Times report . The Explore Feed, which debuted on the Facebook mobile app, is now being rolled out to desktop users. It appears to include posts that Facebook's Explore algorithm predicts that a user will be interested in, based on posts that are similar to ones that the user has liked in the past, or which have been liked by friends. Crucially, it includes content from sources such as pages, publishers, content creators, and organizations that the user does not follow. This enables the user to become exposed to a whole new range of posts that they may not have seen in the past. \"We've heard from people that they want an easy way to explore relevant content from Pages they haven't connected with yet,\" a Facebook spokesperson confirmed in the report. For now the Explore Feed does not appear to include advertising, but this is likely to change as it presents a huge opportunity for Facebook to generate more revenues if it proves popular. To access the Explore Feed, users can click the Explore Feed rocket ship icon on the left sidebar in the Facebook desktop application. The Explore Feed is being rolled out to desktop users now.

(CCM) \u2014 Apple has quashed speculation that it plans to abandon its aging Mac mini, hinting that an updated version of the computer may be imminent, according to a report. The Mac mini has not been updated for three years, and although it is still available in the Apple Store its aging Haswell processors lack the power of those found in modern machines. But in response to an email from a customer, Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said that while it was not time to share any details, \"we do plan for Mac mini to be an important part of our product line going forward,\" the MacRumors report said. The email reinforces a statement made by Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, who said in April that \"the Mac mini is an important product in our lineup,\" the report adds. It concludes that a new Mac mini is unlikely to be announced until next year and that future models will likely use Intel's Kaby Lake quad core processors, which are almost twice as powerful as those found in the current Mac mini range. The Mac mini is Apple's lowest cost desktop computer, starting at just $499, but users have to provide their own monitor and peripherals such as mouse and keyboard.

06:47 AM Leave a comment Security researchers who find vulnerabilities in Tinder and other apps can claim a $1,000 bounty. (CCM) \u2014 Google is offering rewards of $1,000 to hackers who spot security vulnerabilities in apps in the Google Play store and report them to the apps' developers. The Google Play Security Reward Program , run by bug bounty platform HackerOne, offers rewards for bugs found in all Google-developed Android apps in the Play store, as well as third-party apps including Alibaba, Dropbox, Snapchat , Tinder, and four others. Google plans to expand the program to include more third-party app developers in the near future. To qualify for the reward, the vulnerability found has to be a serious one which could be used by a malicious hacker to gain control of the user's device and run malicious software on it without the user's knowledge. This would allow a hacker to cause a banking app to make money transfers without the user's consent, or open a web page that could result in a phishing attack. Google will only pay a reward once the vulnerability has been fixed. Bug bounty programs have become a popular way for companies to encourage security researchers to scrutinize software code for vulnerabilities and report any that they find. This enables them to be fixed before criminals find the same vulnerabilities and exploit them for malicious purposes.

(CCM) \u2014 Essential has slashed the price of its Essential Phone by almost 30% from $699 to $499 in a bid to kickstart the flagging sales of the handset. The Essential Phone was launched at the end of August 2017, but consumer sales to date are estimated to be as low as 5,000 units and a price drop may be the last roll of the dice for Essential to pick up a viable customer base. Companies such as Apple and Samsung typically sell tens of millions of units per quarter. To avoid alienating existing customers, the company is also offering a $200 \"friends and family\" code to them which they can use on the Essential web towards the purchase another Essential Phone or a 360 Camera module before December 16, 2017. The Essential Phone has an impressive spec and has been well received by reviewers, and early problems with the device's camera have largely been resolved through software updates. At $499 for an off-contract, unlocked Android smartphone, it now looks like an outstanding value compared to offerings such as Google's Pixel 2, Samsung's Galaxy S8, and Apple's iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. If the device fails to find traction in the market, that would seem to suggest that consumers are unwilling to buy relatively unknown brands despite the difference in cost.

(CCM) \u2014 The iPhone X will be the first Apple smartphone that company co-founder Steve Wozniak has not stood in line to purchase on the day it is released, according to a CNBC report . Talking at the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas, Wozniak said: \"For some reason, the iPhone X is going to be the first iPhone I didn't \u2014 on day one \u2014 upgrade to. But my wife will, so I'll be close enough to see it. I'd rather wait and watch that one. I'm happy with my iPhone 8, which is the same as the iPhone 7, which is the same as the iPhone 6, to me.\"Wozniak added that when it comes to the Face ID facial recognition system which has replaced Apple's Touch ID fingerprint recognition technology on the iPhone X, he is skeptical that it will work the way that it is suppose to. Apple's iPhone 8 accounts for a smaller proportion of the company's sales than the iPhone 7 did when it was released last year. So Apple will be hoping that this is because consumers are waiting for the opening of pre-order sales of the iPhone X on October 27, 2017, rather than falling interest in the iPhone product line in general.

(CCM) \u2014 Amazon 's Kindle ebook reader will be ten years old on November 19, 2017, and to celebrate the occasion Amazon is slashing $30 off some of its most popular Kindle models, according to a Tech Times report . The standard model is being offered at $49.99, down from $79.99, the Kindle Paperwhite is $89.99, down from $119.99, and the Kindle Voyage is $169.99, down from $199.99. The prices have been reduced until October 25, 2017, according to the report. The deal finishes a few days before the release of Amazon's first waterproof Kindle: the keenly awaited new Kindle Oasis. This has achieved an IPX8 rating and can survive being submerged in up to two metres of water for about 60 minutes, according to Tech Times. Amazon has released nine generations of its Kindle and numerous models with features such as keyboards, cellular connectivity, and touch screens. Although it was originally envisaged that they would be used to annotate documents, Kindles have found most success as simple book and document readers. In 2009 Amazon caused controversy when it remotely deleted some digital editions of books that customers had bought from their Kindle devices because of digital rights issues.

(CCM) \u2014 A new ransomware variant called Bad Rabbit is on the loose and so far has infected computers belonging to companies in Germany, Turkey, Russia, and Ukraine, according to the BBC . The software works in a similar way to the recent WannaCry and Petya ransomware variants that caused havoc around the world earlier this year. \"In some of the companies, the work has been completely paralysed \u2014 servers and workstations are encrypted,\" Ilya Sachkov, Russian cyber-security firm Group-IB's chief, told the TASS news agency, according to the BBC report. Bad Rabbit has also affected a Ukrainian airport and an underground railway system in Kiev, Ukraine's capital. The ransomware makes the data stored on infected computers inaccessible by encrypting it and demands a ransom payable in Bitcoin for the keys needed to decrypt the data. Early ransomware variants demanded whole Bitcoins as payment, but because the value of Bitcoin has skyrocketed from around $200 in 2015 to almost $6000 today, the criminals responsible for Bad Rabbit are demanding just 0.05 Bitcoins (about $280). The U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) recommends that companies do not pay a ransom to ransomware extortionists because \"this does not guarantee that access will be restored.\" Image: \u00a9 Yuriy Vlasenko - Shutterstock.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yuriy vlasenko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilya sachkov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "group-ib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. computer emergency readiness team", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "petya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kiev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-25T16:03:58.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a210c25bb15675ed9c7605f9fa7c765955d7e7d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jcqISxNOZLs.qPViWZA4PFu1CqTlvfN_zPrk.k8s_m5r4uiP9ouIEg9RCmsbpXgTqTq90DiGviBfA--", "site_full": "ccm.net", "site": "ccm.net", "site_section": "http://en.kioskea.net//rss/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "CCM", "title": "Microsoft Kills Off Its Kinect Sensor", "title_full": "Microsoft Kills Off Its Kinect Sensor", "published": "2017-10-25T17:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img-16.ccm2.net/2XPtJIgfGCUSIKISL2dF7a5WUhw=/ed251e6e4b8c40efa9b690b287662e59/ccm-news/kinect-352.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 930, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0a210c25bb15675ed9c7605f9fa7c765955d7e7d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jcqISxNOZLs.qPViWZA4PFu1CqTlvfN_zPrk.k8s_m5r4uiP9ouIEg9RCmsbpXgTqTq90DiGviBfA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PaulRubens", "published": "2017-10-25T17:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Microsoft Kills Off Its Kinect Sensor", "text": "Microsoft Kills Off Its Kinect Sensor   25, 2017 - 10:12 AM Leave a comment The company has finally called time on its depth-sensing and motion-detecting games peripheral. (CCM) \u2014 Microsoft has finally abandoned production of its Kinect body motion sensor, seven years after the product was originally launched, The Telegraph is reporting . Microsoft has sold about 35 million Kinect units in the seven years, and in 2011 it was recognized by Guinness World Records as the fasted-selling consumer device ever. At the time it was far more advanced than the motion sensors on the Nintendo Wii game console, the product which established the body motion game genre in 2006. An updated Kinect 2.0 for Microsoft's Xbox One was released in 2013. While the Kinect was never the success that Microsoft had hoped for with gamers, it was popular with hardware hackers who used the motion detection and depth sensing capabilities of the Kinect in numerous home-brew non-gaming projects. Although the product has been killed, its depth sensing and facial recognition technologies live on in products such as Microsoft's HoloLens and Windows Hello. PrimeSense, the Israeli company which originally developed the Kinect, was acquired by Apple in 2013, and the depth-sensing technology built into Apple's iPhone X to enable its Face ID authentication system is very similar to that used by the Kinect.

(CCM) \u2014 Twitter is no longer on the critical list and the latest business report suggests its future may be getting brighter, according to a Bloomberg news story . The social network's losses have fallen to just $21.1 million in the last quarter, and its revenues of $589.6 were better than expected due to the success of its video advertising and data-licensing platforms. Worryingly for the company, its U.S. advertising revenues fell 11% compared to the same period last year, although this was more than offset by booming international advertising advertising revenues, which grew by 6%. More importantly, Twitter's daily active user count increased by an astonishing 14%, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The company believes that changes to the platform, making it easier to use, and more exposure from global events account for the gain in new users. The fact that the platform is President Trump's favored communications tool is also likely to have raised Twitter's profile among potential users. The company said: \"We expect to see fewer Tweets running into the character limit over time,\" perhaps hinting that it plans to allow longer messages on the platform in the foreseeable future. In September 2017 the company began relaxing the 140 character limit, extending it for some users to 280 characters.

(CCM) \u2014 Dell suffered an embarrassing security lapse this summer after a web address used by recovery software installed on Dell PCs was not renewed by the contractor that controlled it, according to a BBC report . Once the domain name dellbackupandrecoverycloudstorage.com had lapsed it was taken over by an unknown third party. This is a serious security risk because Dell's Backup and Recovery Application, which is pre-installed on many of the company's PCs, automatically downloads updates from that address. Security expert Brian Krebs believes it is possible that the person who snapped up the domain name could have used it to distribute malware disguised as updates to Dell computers. He added on his blog that \"approximately two weeks after SoftThinks, Dell's contractor, lost control over the domain, the server it was hosted on started showing up in malware alerts.\"However, Dell denies that any malware was transferred, and said that SoftThinks has now bought the domain name back from the third party that had acquired it for an undisclosed fee. This is not the first time that a big technology company has been affected by a lapsed domain name. In 1999 Microsoft forgot to renew its Hotmail.co.uk email service domain, and in 2003 it failed to renew its Passport.com single sign-on service domain. In both cases eagle-eyed customers spotted the mistake and renewed the domains on the software giant's behalf.

(CCM) \u2014 Intel is promising PC users blisteringly fast gaming performance with its new Optane SSD 900P Series solid state drives, which launched today. The new drives are the first desktop solid state drives to use Intel's revolutionary 3D XPoint storage medium, which is four times faster than conventional flash storage. 3D XPoint is ideal for the most demanding storage workloads, including 3D rendering, complex simulations, and fast game load times, the company said. 3D XPoint is also up to 22 times more durable than flash storage, meaning that solid state drives that use it will wear out much more slowly. To get an idea of the performance offered by the new drives, Intel demonstrated one rendering a video sequence involving 1.1 billion particles in 6.3 hours, whereas using a conventional solid state drive the same task would take more than 14 hours, according to the company. Intel has launched three 3D XPoint-based models: a 280 GB PCIe version priced at $389, a 480 GB PCIe version at $699, and a 2.5-inch 280 GB U.2 drive priced at $389.

(CCM) \u2014 The security of many web sites is under threat thanks to a new artificial intelligence system which can solve Captcha puzzles, according to a BBC report . These puzzles are intended to enable people to prove that they are human by recognizing letters, numbers, and words that are presented in a way that is difficult for bots and other computer software to make sense of. But researchers at Vicarious, a Californian company funded by Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Facebook 's Mark Zuckerberg, have developed a computer algorithm that mimics the way that humans recognize letters and numbers.

(CCM) \u2014 The security of many websites is under threat thanks to a new artificial intelligence system which can solve Captcha puzzles, according to a BBC report . These puzzles are intended to enable people to prove that they are human by recognizing letters, numbers, and words that are presented in a way that is difficult for bots and other computer software to make sense of. But researchers at Vicarious, a Californian company funded by Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Facebook 's Mark Zuckerberg, have developed a computer algorithm that mimics the way that humans recognize letters and numbers. As a result, the artificial intelligence system can solve 57.1% of PayPal Captchas, 57.4% of Yahoo Captchas, and 66.6% of Google's reCatpcha puzzles.

(CCM) \u2014 Amazon is planning to add the ability to listen to audio books to its entry-level Kindle ebook reader as part of a firmware update, Tech Times is reporting . The Kindle E-reader, which is currently priced at $79.99, is advertized as having \"built-in Audible,\" which will be available \"in the coming months.\" Audible is the name of the audio book service which Amazon purchased in 2008 for about $300 million. The Kindle E-reader does not have a headphone jack, which means that when the service is enabled users will have to listen to audio books on their devices using Bluetooth enabled wireless headphones or speakers. Amazon's $250 flagship Oasis waterproof Kindle already supports Audible, but the company's existing mid-range Paperwhite and Voyage Kindle models do not. Amazon has not said explicitly that these two models will not get Audible support at some point in the future, but no mention has been made of them getting it \"in the coming months.\" It is likely that support will be added to future versions of these models rather than through a firmware update to the existing versions.

(CCM) \u2014 Facebook has denied suggestions that it snoops on conversations through a smartphone's microphone in order to send the owner targeted advertisements, according to a BBC report . Responding to a tweet from PJ Vogt, the presenter of the Reply All podcast, Rob Goldman, Facebook's advertising chief, said: \"I run ads product at Facebook. We don't \u2014 and have never \u2014 used your microphone for ads. Just not true.\" He added that this included the Facebook-owned Instagram service as well as the main Facebook social network. Many Facebook users replied to PJ Vogt's original tweet, describing incidents where they believed Facebook may have been listening to their conversations. For example, Tori Hoover tweeted: \"A co-worker got an ad saying, \"So you popped the question!\" minutes after he proposed, before he told anyone it had happened.\"But David Hand, a mathematics professor from Imperial College, London, told the BBC that there is a simple explanation for the phenomenon. \"If you take something that has a tiny chance of occurring and give it enough opportunities to occur, it inevitably will happen,\" he said. \"We are evolutionarily trained to seek explanations,\" he added.

(CCM) \u2014 Video game retailer GameStop is launching a new all-you-can-eat subscription service for used titles, according to a Polygon report. The Power Pass unlimited gaming subscription lasts for six months, during which time a subscriber can pick any used game from a store, play it for as long as they like, and then exchange it for another one. They can continue to do this for the duration of the subscription. The offer only includes physical game discs, and games from the store's online library are not included. As an added bonus, at the end of the six month period the subscriber can choose any game that they played to keep forever. It is not clear what will happen if more than one subscriber chooses to keep the same game at the end of the subscription period. The Power Pass subscription costs $60 \u2014 approximately the cost of one new PC, PlayStation 4, or Xbox One game \u2014 and gamers can sign up from November 19, 2017. Subscriptions must be activated by January 31, 2018, and subscribers must be members of GamesStop's PowerUp Rewards loyalty scheme to enable the company to keep track of the games that they take out and return to stores.

(CCM) \u2014 Microsoft has unveiled a new Surface Pro tablet with a superfast connection to the internet, at its Future Decoded conference in London. The new Surface Pro with LTE Advanced offers an always-on connection capable of download speeds of up to 450 mbps, according to the company. To achieve this the tablet is equipped with a Cat 9 Qualcomm X16 Gigabit Class LTE modem with support for 20 cellular bands, which means that the tablet can be used on 4G networks almost anywhere in the world. The modem features seven antennas and is built into the motherboard to ensure fast initiation when the tablet emerges from sleep or hibernation modes. Microsoft says that it expects the battery to support 17 hours of video playback, although with an LTE connection in use the battery life is likely to be less. The base version of the new Surface Pro has an Intel i5 processor, 4 GB RAM, a 128 GB SSD, and is priced at $1,149. A premium version with twice the RAM and SSD storage is priced at $1,449. Both will be available to purchase before the end of the year.

(CCM) \u2014 Video gamers prefer to use the Nintendo Switch as a handheld device than as a conventional game console, Nintendo has revealed . The Nintendo Switch is unusual because its hybrid design means that it can be docked to a based unit and used a console, or used undocked with a joypad attached on each side as a handheld device. When it was launched in March 2017 many commentators wondered if users would bother undocking the device, given the popularity of smartphones as handheld gaming devices. But Nintendo's own research reveals that about 30% of Switch owners use their device in handheld mode the majority of the time, while less than 20% keep the device docked most of the time. About half of owners swap between the two modes fairly evenly. Nintendo has always had the reputation of making entertainment systems for younger gamers, but the company's data shows that a huge proportion of Switch buyers are in their twenties or early thirties, although it is also popular with people aged between 10 and 19, and those in their late 30s. The Switch has been unexpectedly successful, prompting Nintendo to raise their sales projections and increase production. The company expects to sell about 14 million units in the device's first year on sale \u2014 about half a million more units than Nintendo's Wii U sold during its five year production period.

Apple made pairing its AirPod earphones to an iOS device effortless, and Google's Fast Pair is Android's answer to this. To pair a Fast Pair-enabled device, a user simply turns it on and puts it in pairing mode. The user's Android device will then detect a Fast Pair data packet, which it sends to Google's servers and gets back an image of the device, as well as its name, and a companion app if one exists. The user then gets a notification asking them to \"Tap to pair,\" with the name and image of the device. Tapping completes the pairing process \u2014 there is no need for the user to enter their device's Bluetooth settings at all. Fast Pair works on all supported Android devices running Google Play services 11.7 or later, with compatibility back to Android 6.0 Marshmallow . The pairing system is currently being rolled out to Android 6.0 and later devices. Devices that support Fast Pair now include Google Pixel Buds and Lobraton Q Adapt On-Ear headphones.

(CCM) \u2014 The Bitcoin virtual currency has smashed through its previous price ceiling, peaking at $6649.33 on Wednesday, according to a BBC report . The currency was worth less than $100 in June 2013, and less than $1,000 at the beginning of this year. But since then the price has continued to skyrocket. The total value of all Bitcoin in circulation is now in excess of $110 billion. There are several reasons why Bitcoin has appreciated so much, so quickly. One is that a spin-off currency called Bitcoin Cash proved not to be as disruptive as anticipated. And instability in the Korean Peninsula may also have prompted people in the region to invest in Bitcoin instead of Japanese Yen or U.S. dollars. More recently, a U.S.-based derivatives marketplace operator called CME Group announced plans to launch a Bitcoin futures product, the report says, which may also have contributed to the currency's strength. The BBC says that Coinbase, a company that facilitates trades in digital currencies, has been signing up between 35,000 and 50,000 new Bitcoin users every day. But Garrick Hileman, a research fellow at University of Cambridge, warned the BBC that if government regulators crack down on virtual currencies then the value of Bitcoin could drop significantly.

(CCM) \u2014 A startup that hoped to revolutionize wireless earbud technology has collapsed after selling just 25,000 of its Here One product, Business Insider is reporting . Doppler Labs raised $50 million to develop its super-smart Hear One earbuds that offer a noise-cancelling feature called \"active listening.\" This allows users to tune the earbuds using a companion app so that they can do things like suppress the noise of an airplane's engines while still hearing the person sitting next to them normally, or amplify the bass at a music concert. Doppler faced stiff competition from industry giants such as Apple and Google, both of which offer smart wireless earbuds. Google's recently released Pixel Buds , for example, offer real-time translation which allows users to hold conversations with people talking a language they do not speak. But the product's biggest problem was its poor battery life. Initially the company promised that the Here Now buds would last about as long as Apple's AirPods on a single charge, but when the product shipped they often ran out of power after just two or three hours. The company had expected to sell over 100,000 units before developing a more advanced version of the product, but when sales failed to materialize the company ran out of money and is now in the process of closing its doors for good.
