That is why the theme of this year \u2019 s World Teachers \u2019 Day \u2013 \u201c Teaching in Freedom , Empowering Teachers \u201d \u2013 reaffirms the value of empowered teachers and recognizes the challenges many encounter in their professional lives across the globe.\n\u4f46\u5168\u4e16\u754c\u6709\u592a\u591a\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u5f97\u4e0d\u5230\u4ece\u4e8b\u5176\u6781\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u548c\u652f\u6301\u3002 \u56e0\u6b64\u4eca\u5e74\u4e16\u754c\u6559\u5e08\u65e5\u7684\u4e3b\u9898 \u2014\u2014 \u201c\u589e\u6559\u5e08\u6743\u80fd\uff0c\u4fc3\u6559\u5b66\u81ea\u7531\u201d \u2014\u2014 \u91cd\u7533\u6559\u5e08 \u6743\u80fd\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u8bb8\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u5728\u5176\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\nBeing an empowered teacher means having access to high-quality training , fair wages , and continuous opportunities for professional development. It also means having the freedom to support the development of national curricula -- and the professional autonomy to choose the most appropriate methods and approaches that enable more effective , inclusive and equitable education.

At the tertiary level , teachers are often employed on a fixed-term , contingency basis. This in turn can result in greater job insecurity , diminished career prospects , higher workload and lower wages \u2013 all of which can restrict academic freedom and undermine the quality of education that teachers can deliver.\n\u652f\u6301\u6559\u5e08\u521b\u65b0\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u524d\u6cbf\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5b66\u672f\u81ea\u7531\uff0c\u5bf9\u5404\u7ea7\u6559\u80b2\u7684 \u6559\u5e08\u90fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6821\u6559\u5e08\u5c24\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\uff0c\u6559\u5e08\u5e38\u5e38\u662f\u4e34\u65f6\u6027 \u5b9a\u671f\u8058\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u9020\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u52a0\u91cd\u3001\u804c\u4e1a\u524d\u666f\u53d7\u635f\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u3001\u5de5\u8d44 \u964d\u4f4e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898 \u2014\u2014 \u8fd9\u4e00\u5207\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u5b66\u672f\u81ea\u7531\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\nAcross all education levels , political pressure and business interests can curb the ability of educators to teach in freedom.

It means providing teachers with training and development. It means increasing the number of quality teachers , especially in those countries with high numbers of untrained teaching personnel. It means removing unnecessary restrictions on research and teaching and defending academic freedom at all education levels. Finally , it means raising the status of teachers around the world in a way that honors and reflects the impact they have on the strength of

In fact, if you type in \"makeup\" on YouTube, the first search suggestion that pops out is 'makeup tutorial Korea'. Do you have any idea why Korean makeup is so popular around the world?\nJ: I think Korean makeup is all about looking natural and young and cute, rather than looking all mature and sexy. So I think that's why a lot of people like Korean makeup, the people who like to look younger and cute. I think those kind of people would search for Korean make up tutorials online. And Korean makeup products are really famous right?\nS: Yeah we've heard about INNISFREE, CLIO\u2026\nJ: So the makeup products might have an impact I guess.\nImpact\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bcd\u505a\u201c\u5f71\u54cd\u201d\u65f6\u53ef\u4ee5\u662f\u540d\u8bcd\u6216\u8005\u52a8\u8bcd\uff0c\u4ecb\u8bcd\u5747\u4e3aon, upon\nE.g. The reopening of the line would have a huge impact on the area's \"psychologically\".\nS: And they're affordable. So when did you start dealing with cosmetics?\nJ: I always wear sunscreen since I was in middle school. And like this full-on makeup with all the brows, eye makeup and lip color, it was from 20, after college.\nS: Oh I thought Korean girls might start early.\nJ: Yeah a lot of Korean students start putting on makeup when they're really young like in middle school. And for some, even elementary school. But I was in lag of that. I was too lazy to put on makeup in the morning. So I started wearing makeup after college.\nIn lag of\n\u4e00\u822c\u597d\u50cf\u8bf4in the lag of\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u662f\u6ede\u540e\u4e8e\u2026\u2026\u7684\u610f\u601d\u3002\nS: So when you started wearing makeups, did you follow any channels like Pony's makeup channel to learn?\nJ: Yeah. Before I started to put on makeup, I followed quite a number of beauty gurus on YouTube. Some were Americans, some were Koreans, some were Japanese, like a lot of people around the world I've been watching them before I started wearing makeup. I used to when I was in Korea, but after i got here, i don\u2019t really have that much time.\nS: It has just become a daily routine for you.\nJ: But it\u2019s not that I follow the exact routine of beauty gurus when I watch their tutorials online. I just like to watch the process of somebody to be prettier.\nS: Tell us about your makeup routine everyday.\nJ: In the morning I wake up. I go to the bathroom, brush my teeth, wash my face and then I come out and sit in front of my desk. I keep all my makeup products on my desk. So first I apply toner\uff08\u5316\u5986\u6c34\uff09 with cotton pads to soothe my skin and all and prepare for all the moisture to come. Then I put on serum\uff08\u7cbe\u534e\uff09 , which is very liquid. And then after my skin absorbs it all, I put on moisturizer\uff08\u9762\u971c\uff09 , which is not as liquid as serum. Then I put on sunscreen\uff08\u9632\u6652\u971c\uff09 which is really important. You have to protect your skin from the UV rays. I sometimes put on primer\uff08\u5986\u524d\u4e73\uff09 , I sometimes don\u2019t. If I have a lot of time, i do. And then I either apply foundation\uff08\u7c89\u5e95\u6db2\uff09 or a cushion foundation\uff08\u6c14\u57ab\uff09 . Do you know what a cushion foundation is?\n\u8fd9\u91cc\u63d0\u9192\u5927\u5bb6\u6ce8\u610f\u4e00\u4e0bsooth\u548csoothe\u7684\u610f\u601d\u5dee\u5f88\u591a\u54e6\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u662f\u8212\u7f13\u3002Don\u2019t get it wrong~\nS: yes i know. I never use that though.\nJ: Really? You should try. It\u2019s really convenient cuz you have to just like pop that on. And that I have never used a foundation brush. I\u2019m always using a sponge. I use that for everything. I use the sponge to apply on my foundation or cushion foundation and then I apply powder\uff08\u6563\u7c89\uff09 with the same sponge. And then I like to contour\uff08\u9634\u5f71\uff09 and highlight\uff08\u9ad8\u5149\uff09 , with that same sponge again. And then I fill in my eyebrows . Another really important thing as sunscreen is eye primer . You know some Asians have double eyelids and some don\u2019t, right? I have those so if I don\u2019t put on eye primer before I put on my eyeshadow\uff08\u773c\u5f71\uff09 , it tends to crease a lot. So I never skip eye primer. So eye primer, eye shadow, eyeliner\uff08\u773c\u7ebf\uff09 , mascara\uff08\u776b\u6bdb\u818f\uff09 . That\u2019s it for my eye makeup. And then I put on lip color.\nS: so as you said, the only tool you use is a sponge?\nJ: Yeah, and to do my eye makeup, I do use a couple of eye brushes. I use MISSHA, APIEU, ETUDE HOUSE. Most of my eyeshadows are from ETUDE HOUSE.\nS: Yeah they have those palettes with a lot of colors.\nJ: My mascara is from PERI PERA. It is kind of like CLIO and PERI PERA are like MISSHA and APIEU, basically the same company with different names.\nA&B are like C&D\n\u7c7b\u6bd4\u8bf4\u660e\uff0cA\u548cB\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0eC\u548cD\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fd9\u6837\u8868\u8fbe ink to pen is like gas to car\nS: What is your advice for makeup starters when they choose their products? The more expensive the better or?\nJ: No I don\u2019t think so. Especially for starters, beginners, I don\u2019t think the more expensive the better is true. Cuz you have to try a lot of different things, different texture, different colors, to see what is right for you right? So i think for beginners, it\u2019s better to buy a lot of affordable stuff until you figure out you own style and then you can build up on your collection on luxuries.\nS: so apart from makeup, skin care is also very important to keep our beauty. So ummm....\nJ: So I think I use sheet masks every once in a while since I\u2019m here.\nHalloween is coming!\nJ: So it was really fun to have this interview with Senyi and I hope to talk to her again like some time later.\nS: Yeah sure!\nJ: \u518d\u89c1\uff01\nS: See you~ Have a nice day:)\nPS:\u8fd9\u6b21\u7684\u63a8\u9001\u662f\u548cJee Soo\u4ee5\u804a\u5929\u5f62\u5f0f\u5f55\u5236\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u526a\u8f91\u4e86\u4e0d\u5c11\uff0c\u4e5f\u5e0c\u671b\u5927\u5bb6\u4e0d\u8981\u4ecb\u610f\u6709\u4e9b\u526a\u8f91\u8fc7\u6e21\u4e0d\u591f\u597d~\uff08\u597d\u50cf\u6211\u7684\u53e3\u6c34\u8bdd\u90fd\u662fyeah\u771f\u662f\u5f97\u6539\u6539\u4e86hhh\uff09\n\u7f8e\u5316\u7f16\u8f91 | \u5c0f\u6cf3\n\u5c01\u9762\u56fe\u7247 | \u9ecd\u79bb\n\u5ba1\u6838\u6821\u5bf9 | \u5f20\u6d25 \u8fd4\u56de\u641c\u72d0\uff0c\u67e5\u770b\u66f4\u591a\n\u8d23\u4efb\u7f16\u8f91\uff1a", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20171016/b1899ee5644f4946ac6bfd68b01b0866.jpeg", "http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20171016/aaf0b24ce60644eaa68a602790389e4d.jpeg", "http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20171016/aaf771a11ecf4e7891b8ddf37bf211c2.jpeg", "http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20171016/c8eb8b89d01241f49052d8010dcff782.jpeg", "http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20171016/2479a9c95e7c440da832a1f1dcb8d89d.jpeg"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jee soo", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [{"name": "clio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peri pera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "a&b", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "innisfree", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T01:51:18.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c090df833b8b6dc12a323dec72c2db1a0e5c10d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_8dLlCihpqlRXjbVsD0mczZF1vqnwx_3NxB7WwaSkL5g--", "site_full": "www.sohu.com", "site": "sohu.com", "site_section": "http://www.sohu.com/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "\u641c\u72d0", "title": "NFL Players Must be Glad, at Least they are not in China_\u641c\u72d0\u793e\u4f1a_\u641c\u72d0\u7f51", "title_full": "NFL Players Must be Glad, at Least they are not in China_\u641c\u72d0\u793e\u4f1a_\u641c\u72d0\u7f51", "published": "2017-10-31T10:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.032, "main_image": "http://sohu-media.bjcnc.scs.sohucs.com/web/static/images/sohu_logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 38, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c090df833b8b6dc12a323dec72c2db1a0e5c10d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_8dLlCihpqlRXjbVsD0mczZF1vqnwx_3NxB7WwaSkL5g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sohu.com", "published": "2017-10-31T10:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "NFL Players Must be Glad, at Least they are not in China_\u641c\u72d0\u793e\u4f1a_\u641c\u72d0\u7f51", "text": "\u539f\u6807\u9898\uff1aNFL Players Must be Glad, at Least they are not in China\nWhile the NFL protests remains to be the trending topics in sports, the Chinese government recently decided to step up against anyone who disrespect their anthems and flags.\nChinese state news agency Xinhua announced that the China\u2019s parliament is considering criminal penalties for those who disrespect the national anthem and national flags.\nReportedly, a draft amendment to the country\u2019s Criminal Law was submitted for deliberation at a session of the National People's Congress Standing Committee on Monday. According to the draft, those who deliberately mock the national anthem, burn, destroy or topple the national flags could face up to three years in prison. As the People's Congress is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party, this rule will certainly pass.\nThe amendment is seen as a retaliation against Hong Kong dissidents, who protest against the Chinese National Anthem during the Asian World Cup qualification games in 2015. This law further deteriorates the already tarnished freedom of expression in China.\nSuch amendment to the law would be unconstitutional in the United States, as the first amendment ensures the freedom of express, including mockeries of the so-called national symbols.\nThe NFL players' protests had brought up huge controversies in the past year, many believed that the kneeling protests during the singing of the national anthem is disrespecting the American national flag. Despite many who dislike such behaviors during the game, the players' right to protest in such way is well protected by the first amendment of the American constitution.\nHong Kong football fans from now on will not have the same privilege as the NFL players do. Their future protests, accordingly, may lead to prison times and state persecutions. \u8fd4\u56de\u641c\u72d0\uff0c\u67e5\u770b\u66f4\u591a\n\u8d23\u4efb\u7f16\u8f91\uff1a", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20171031/f70911ef113a41a6bd5bbd671265b806.jpeg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "xinhua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national people's congress standing committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinese communist party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinese national anthem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "people's congress", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-31T21:34:10.000+02:00"}], "totalResults": 6, "moreResultsAvailable": 0, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=1eee5ef1-4d51-497e-9e88-ed86353bcda9&format=json&ts=1509478450000&q=language%3Aenglish+site%3Asohu.com&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 660}
