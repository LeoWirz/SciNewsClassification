If you are a sensible person, you would have backed up your old iPhone to your computer using iTunes (let's be real, none of us are paying Apple for more iCloud storage for cloud backup). But when you get your shiny new iPhone 8 (or any of the other iPhones that are still on sale) and try to restore from your old back, your iTunes throws this in your face. \nThe problem is here that iTunes is an even bigger pile of trash than what we already thought it was. Fortunately, your backup is still usable and all you need to do is upgrade your phone. \nThe problem arises because your old iPhone was likely running iOS 11.0.1 when you backed it up but the new iPhone that you just pulled out of the box is running iOS 11 (or even older). This creates a mismatch of OS versions, as iTunes can only restore a backup to a device running the same version of iOS as the backup. \nBecause of this, the first thing you need to do is use iTunes to update your phone to the latest version. It could be a version same as your backup or newer (but not older) and once you do that, your backup will magically work again with your new iPhone. \nIt's a real shame that post had to be written and this could have been avoided if iTunes just showed a more sensible error message or guided the user on what needs to be done. \nStill, the iTunes backup is a magical thing that backs up literally everything on your phone, from your photos to your videos, applications, application settings, device settings, home screen arrangement, network settings and so much more and it would be a shame to miss out on all of that and start over from scratch. So if you have the backup still around and you couldn't restore it due to the stupid error, you could try this method and give it another shot.

Indeed, the set looks awfully similar to the outgoing Apple emoji set, with some elements of the new Android Oreo emoji set with a dash of Twitter emoji set thrown in. While all of these are based on a common instruction from Unicode and it makes sense for them to look similar to reduce lost in translation between devices, they are a bit too similar. \nWhatsApp started using Apple's emoji set back in the day because Android back then had no support for emoji. To make sure the emoji sent by iPhone users would be seen on Android devices, WhatsApp integrated the entire Apple emoji set within its application. Even later on when Android did get emoji support, it still made sense for WhatsApp to have the Apple set to ensure compatibility as not all Android devices had emoji support and some looked different than others. \nRight now I am not entirely sure if this set will be only available on non-Apple devices or across all platforms that WhatsApp is available on. I guess it makes sense to still use the native Apple emoji set on Apple devices as these emoji do look quite similar. Maybe that was the purpose in making them look so similar and WhatsApp probably just wanted to stop using Apple's set, possibly for legal reason (although it is still a mystery how they got around to using it all these years). \nThis set will eventually make its way to the final build and likely to the desktop versions as well.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "unicode", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:42:09.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b9c046a722707c774e7d12fefac5c4be0000eea1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8YtyF9AGbu_SmZ7tTRKKDH49Eb.0XKHaK3LFVV1nKN19B9jVQqh7j342vOe3dIJrlN7o6sbYRboHWNre0WtUgMs8BPRjiyd5tpep6QP4MCC9d_sSJNG76s", "site_full": "www.gsmarena.com", "site": "gsmarena.com", "site_section": "http://www.gsmarena.com/rss-news-reviews.php3", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "GSMArena.com - Latest articles", "title": "Entry-level Honor Holly 4 debuts", "title_full": "Entry-level Honor Holly 4 debuts", "published": "2017-10-03T17:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/17/10/huawei-holly-4-india/-728x314/gsmarena_000.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 365, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 16, "comments": 0, "shares": 16}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b9c046a722707c774e7d12fefac5c4be0000eea1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8YtyF9AGbu_SmZ7tTRKKDH49Eb.0XKHaK3LFVV1nKN19B9jVQqh7j342vOe3dIJrlN7o6sbYRboHWNre0WtUgMs8BPRjiyd5tpep6QP4MCC9d_sSJNG76s", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T17:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Entry-level Honor Holly 4 debuts", "text": "Huawei Honor Android Announcement \nHuawei's Honor brand will start selling a new phone in India, starting today.

Today DxO Labs outed the result achieved by Samsung's Galaxy Note8, and it's... also 94. \nThe iPhone 8 Plus and Galaxy Note8 are thus tied at the top of the DxOMark smartphone camera rankings, for now at least. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will get official tomorrow, and last year the Pixel jumped straight to the top of the DxO camera chart on the day of its announcement.

All in all, this may be a short lived victory for the Note8 and iPhone 8 Plus, but let's let them enjoy it while it lasts. Accurate exposure in bright light, bold colors, and good levels of fine detail \nThe Note8 receives the first ever score of 100 for photography, thanks to its excellent zoom performance up to 4x, very low noise levels in low light, fast and accurate autofocus, good detail in bright light and indoor conditions, as well as the bright and vivid colors it captures. Limited dynamic range in challenging high-contrast scenes, with some loss of highlight detail \nThe downsides for photo capture have to do with limited dynamic range and frequent highlight clipping, as well as frequent white balance casts in bright light and indoor conditions. The bokeh effect is sometimes not visible even when the mode is enabled. Excellent exposures under indoor lighting, well-managed noise, fairly good detail preservation \nIn video capture, the Note8 displays good white balance and color rendering, good exposure and fast exposure convergence, a stable and fast autofocus, good noise reduction regardless of light conditions, and good stabilization. \nOn the flip side, there's no autofocus tracking capability in default mode, and residual motion is visible when holding the camera still during recording. There's also shadow and highlight clipping in high-contrast scenes.

But you can enjoy an unofficial presentation of its specs right here. There are few surprises here, given what we\u0092ve gleaned from leaks. \nThe new XL will have a 6\u0094 P-OLED screen (courtesy of LG). It\u0092s an 18:9 screen with 1,440 x 2,880px resolution. Always On Display is not listed, but given that both the screen and Android 8.0 Oreo support it, we think it\u0092s more than likely. By the way, the screen has 3D Arc Glass (Gorilla Glass 5 specifically). Leaked Pixel XL 2 specs (click for full size) \nThe SIM situation has been cleared up \u0096 this is technically a dual SIM phone, with one nano-SIM slot and one permanent eSIM (embedded SIM). Both GSM and CDMA are supported, so presumably you\u0092ll have your pick of carriers. \nThere\u0092s no word on the 3.5mm audio jack, but there\u0092s something called Adaptive Audio Amplifier. The Pixel XL 2 boasts three mics with noise cancellation and Wi-Fi calling. \nUnfortunately, the specs for the camera department have been cut in half. Only the selfie cam is listed \u0096 8MP sensor with f/2.4 aperture, nothing new here. There\u0092s nothing on the main camera (other rumors suggest 12MP with OIS). \nThe \u0093Pixel Visual Core\u0094 caught our attention, though. Rumors suggest that Google has created a special chip to do image processing, going beyond the HDR+, which runs on Qualcomm\u0092s IPS. Google Pixel XL 2 \nSpeaking of, the phone will be powered by the Snapdragon 835 with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage (there\u0092s likely a 128GB version as well, a 256GB model seem less likely). Android 8.0 Oreo with Google Assistant will be available out of the box. \nThe body is built out of aluminum with a smaller glass window on the back. Dust and water resistance are still basic, there\u0092s no IP rating. Inside is a 3,520mAh battery with no mention of wireless charging. \nThere\u0092s something called \u0093advanced x-axis haptics sensor\u0094 which sounds like the squeeze sensor from the HTC U11, rumored to be part of the new Pixels.

Today DxO Labs outed the result achieved by Samsung's Galaxy Note8, and it's... also 94. \nThe iPhone 8 Plus and Galaxy Note8 are thus tied at the top of the DxOMark smartphone camera rankings, for now at least. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will get official tomorrow, and last year the Pixel jumped straight to the top of the DxO camera chart on the day of its announcement. Then there's the iPhone X , also a possible contender for the No.1 spot, and let's not forget the Huawei Mate 10 either. All in all, this may be a short lived victory for the Note8 and iPhone 8 Plus, but we'll let them enjoy it while it lasts. Accurate exposure in bright light, bold colors, and good levels of fine detail \nThe Note8 receives the first ever score of 100 for photography, thanks to its excellent zoom performance up to 4x, very low noise levels in low light, fast and accurate autofocus, good detail in bright light and indoor conditions, as well as the bright and vivid colors it captures. Limited dynamic range in challenging high-contrast scenes, with some loss of highlight detail \nThe downsides for photo capture have to do with limited dynamic range and frequent highlight clipping, as well as frequent white balance casts in bright light and indoor conditions. The bokeh effect is sometimes not visible even when the mode is enabled. Excellent exposures under indoor lighting, well-managed noise, fairly good detail preservation \nIn video capture, the Note8 displays good white balance and color rendering, good exposure and fast exposure convergence, a stable and fast autofocus, good noise reduction regardless of light conditions, and good stabilization. \nOn the flip side, there's no autofocus tracking capability in default mode, and residual motion is visible when holding the camera still during recording. There's also shadow and highlight clipping in high-contrast scenes. White balance is generally accurate and pleasant, but a slight pink color cast shows up on some outdoor pictures \nTo read the full report from DxO Labs, with many more photo samples included, make sure you jump to the Source link below.

If you are a sensible person, you would have backed up your old iPhone to your computer using iTunes (let's be real, none of us are paying Apple for more iCloud storage for cloud backup). But when you get your shiny new iPhone 8 (or any of the other iPhones that are still on sale) and try to restore from your old back, your iTunes throws this in your face. \nThe problem is here that iTunes is an even bigger pile of trash than what we already thought it was. Fortunately, your backup is still usable and all you need to do is upgrade your phone. \nThe problem arises because your old iPhone was likely running iOS 11.0.1 when you backed it up but the new iPhone that you just pulled out of the box is running iOS 11 (or even older). This creates a mismatch of OS versions, as iTunes can only restore a backup to a device running the same version of iOS as the backup. \nBecause of this, the first thing you need to do is use iTunes to update your phone to the latest version. It could be a version same as your backup or newer (but not older) and once you do that, your backup will magically work again with your new iPhone. \nIt's a real shame that post had to be written and this could have been avoided if iTunes just showed a more sensible error message or guided the user on what needs to be done. \nStill, the iTunes backup is a magical thing that backs up literally everything on your phone, from your photos to your videos, applications, application settings, device settings, home screen arrangement, network settings and so much more and it would be a shame to miss out on all of that and start over from scratch. So if you have the backup still around and you couldn't restore it due to the stupid error, you could try this method and give it another shot.

With Google's AI at your ear tips you'll be able to get directions, start a call and naturally play music. Google Pixel Buds \nWhat's even cooler is you can translate in real time with the help of the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL - just speak into the Pixel Buds and the Pixel 2 will play your words through its loudspeaker in 40 different languages and play the translated answer back in your ear. \nThe Pixel Buds come in a pocket-sized wireless charging case that will top up around 24 more hours of battery life into them. \nMoving on to another interesting accessory, which Google showcased today - the Google Clips. It's a smart little camera that's designed to capture your precious moments all on its own. \nGoogle Clips is small and can decide for itself what moments are snap-worthy. It will automatically capture short clips which you can review seconds later on your phone through the Google Clips app - available on Android and iOS. \nGoogle says that Clips is \"coming soon\" starting with the United States. It's designed to work with Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy S7/S8 and iPhone (6 and up). When available Google Clips will retail for $249. \nThe Google Pixel Buds are available for pre-order today in Just Black, Clearly White and Kinda Blue.

And if you thought the Galaxy Note8 and iPhone 8 Plus' score of 94 was impressive, think again - the Pixel 2 just pushed the bar higher to a record 98 points overall. \nThe new 12MP camera relies on a 1/2.6\" sensor behind an f/1.8 aperture lens, as opposed to 1/2.3\" and f/2.0. Dual pixel autofocus now enters the specsheet, and the lens is stabilized - two serious improvements over the previous model. \nThose are the specs rounded up but it's in the pictures where the Pixel 2's made the real difference, apparently, to deserve an unrivaled 99 points score. Starting with bright daylight, the Pixel 2 gets praise for detail capture, color rendition and dynamic range. In low light detail is well preserved at the expense of some luminance noise though it does lose detail in brightly-backlit indoor scenarios. Flash performance is commendable too. \nSingle-camera bokeh has been a thing for a while too, requiring a notch more software magic than what you can achieve by using two cameras, and the Pixel 2 can do that. It's an improvement over the original Pixel, DxO states, but still can't match the iPhone 8 Plus when it comes to producing a natural-looking background blur. \nIt's another record in video capture where the Pixel 2 secures 96 points. Good exposure, fast, smooth and stable autofocus with subject tracking come on top of an excellent balance between detail capture and noise reduction. DxO also notes a further improved video stabilization over the previous model's already superb algorithms. \nThose were the numbers, but for the detailed DxO reviewers' findings, head over to the source link below.

There are trade-in and financing options available straight from Google as well. \nSo, the large storage Google Pixel XL will set you back $770 - not cheap, by any means, but you are still getting one of the most impressive camera phones of 2016. Google's HDR+ Auto is still an industry-leading algorithm, which makes great use of the Pixel XL's 12.3 MP, f/2.0 camera. \nAnd you can be sure that Google will be bringing future software improvements to its last generation hardware as well.

As before, we\u0092re looking at a small and an XL model. \nGoogle Pixel 2 XL \nWe\u0092ll begin with the more premium device \u0096 the Google Pixel 2 XL . The LG V30 influences are clearly visible in the 18:9 P-OLED screen. Its bezels are a bit thicker since they\u0092ve been loaded with stereo speakers. The screen measures 6\u0094 and it is taller but not wider than the screen of the original XL. The resolution is 1,440 x 2,880px (538ppi) and there's a circular polarizer for improved sunlight legibility. Always On Display is enabled too(Oreo brought native support). \nThe screen is tucked under a protective pane of Gorilla Glass 5 with beveled edges (3D Arc Glass). There\u0092s glass on the back as well, the rest of the body is built out of aluminum. The basic water resistance was bumped up to IP67. \nThe Pixels stick with single cameras on the front and back. The main camera now has OIS to aid its 12MP sensor and next gen image processing. The selfie cam seem unchanged with its 8MP sensor and f/2.4 aperture. Google Pixel 2 XL: Just Black \u0095 Black & White \nThe core of the new Pixel XL 2 is the top Snapdragon dog - 835, coupled with 4GB of RAM and running Android 8.0 Oreo. Google did bump up the storage, now 64GB is the base option (there\u0092s a 128GB model for those that need more). The battery is essentially unchanged at 3,520mAh capacity. \nGoogle put an eSIM inside the new phones, which will be used with Google Fi and other carriers. There\u0092s a standard nano-SIM slot if you want to use this the old school way (both GSM and CDMA networks are supported). \nThe Google Pixel 2 XL is coming in mid-November at a starting price of $850 / \u0080940 / \u00a3800 (add $100 / \u0080110 / \u00a3100 if you need the larger storage). You can have it in Just Black and Black & White. \nPre-orders are live today in the UK, Germany, the US (via Google Store and Verizon), India, Australia and Canada. For a limited time, you're getting a free Home Mini. Pre-orders in Italy, Singapore, Spain will kick off later this year. \nGoogle Pixel 2 \nThe Google Pixel 2 looks stuck in time with those chunky bezels on the front. They do house front-facing stereo speakers, but the device isn\u0092t that much more compact than its XL sibling. The screen itself hasn\u0092t changed in size \u0096 it\u0092s still a 5\u0094 AMOLED panel of 1080p resolution. \nBoth Pixels share a feature borrowed from the HTC U11 \u0096 the phone can detect pressure on its sides so you can squeeze it to trigger select actions. Launching the Google Assistant, for example. Google Pixel 2: Just Black \u0095 Clearly White \u0095 Kinda Blue \nYou are also getting the new 835 chipset and extra storage compared to last year\u0092s model, the new OIS-enabled camera as well. Both Pixel 2 models get free Google Photos storage. \nThe Google Pixel 2 will also launch on October 17 at a starting price of $650 / \u0080800 / \u00a3630. (a $100 / \u0080110 / \u00a3100 bill buys you double the storage). The color options are called Kindla Blue, Just Black and Clearly White.

The Home Mini is covered in a new fabric-like material that was developed specifically for it. \nThe Google Home Mini will become available on October 19 for $49, in the three colors you see above, from major retailers in the US. \nOn the other hand, the Home Max is all about music quality, with its two 4.5\" woofers with high-excursion, to really boost those low frequencies. Two custom 0.7\" tweeters complete the package. It's 20 times louder than the initial Google Home. Max uses Smart Sound, powered by Google's AI. It adapts to you and your surroundings. It will automatically tune the speaker to correct for where it's placed in a room. Since it's all done dynamically, if you move it it will adjust again. It will tune EQ to what you're listening to, and turn volume up when the dishwasher's running, for example. YouTube Music, Spotify, and other top music services are supported. It can be stood up vertically or placed horizontally. \nIt will be available in the US in December in two shades of grey for $399, and it comes with a free one-year subscription to YouTube Music and YouTube Red, so you can listen to music ad-free. \nBoth the Google Home Mini and the Google Home Max come with the Google Assistant as you'd expect, and the exact same AI feature set as the original Home. You can talk to it, ask it questions, ask it to play music, cast audio to it, or have it control your Chromecasts and smart home products.

Strangely enough, the smaller of the two devices hasn't changed much, but the larger Pixel 2 XL is much more in step with modern flagships. \nFirst things first, let's check what's new. Google upgraded to the flagship-standard Snapdragon 835 chipset, and the phones run Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box. The screens are AMOLEDs with pixel densities identical to their predecessors, but there are stereo speakers above and below now. The headphone jack is dead, however. \nThe new Pixels do not feature dual cameras - Google believes it can keep its edge with just one (it was always about that HDR+ processing anyway). Optical Image Stabilization is a nice addition to the feature set (the old EIS lives on too). \nWe're glad to see stereo speakers back, but other old Nexus features remain absent - wireless charging and high-grade water resistance. Google Pixel 2: Just Black \u0095 Clearly White \u0095 Kinda Blue Google Pixel 2 \nSo that's the Google Pixel 2 for you. It has a 5\" 1080p AMOLED, a new chipset and not a great deal more. Well, outside of HTC's squeezable feature, this time tied to Google Assistant. Google Pixel 2 at a glance: Body : metal and glass; IP67 dust and water resistant Screen: 5\" AMOLED, 1080p resolution (441ppi); Always On Display; Gorilla Glass Camera: 12MP 1/2.6\" sensor; f/1.8 aperture; OIS and Dual Pixel AF Video: 4K recording Platform: Snapdragon 835 chipset; octa-core CPU (Kryo 280); Adreno 540 GPU Memory: 4GB of RAM; 64GB or 128GB storage (non-expandable) Battery: 2,700mAh (sealed); USB Power Delivery Misc: Active Edge, stereo speakers, fingerprint reader Price : $650 / \u0080800 / \u00a3630 (available October 17) Google Pixel 2 XL: Just Black \u0095 Black & White Google Pixel 2 XL \nThe Google Pixel 2 XL did see a redesign - those heavy top and bottom bezels have been shaved down to more manageable levels. Not quite bezel-less, but the new XL is part of the 18:9 screen crew. This handset was built by LG, perhaps it reminds you of a certain other Fall flagship? Google Pixel 2 XL at a glance: Body : metal and glass; IP67 dust and water resistant Screen: 6\" AMOLED 18:9, QHD+ resolution (537ppi); Always On Display; Gorilla Glass Camera: 12MP 1/2.6\" sensor; f/1.8 aperture; OIS and Dual Pixel AF Video: 4K recording Platform: Snapdragon 835 chipset; octa-core CPU (Kryo 280); Adreno 540 GPU Memory: 4GB of RAM; 64GB or 128GB storage (non-expandable) Battery: 3,520mAh (sealed); USB Power Delivery Misc: Active Edge, stereo speakers, fingerprint reader Price : $850 / \u0080940 / \u00a3800 (available in mid November) \nHow's that for a year of progress? Perhaps fans won't sing songs glorifying the new Pixels, but they do seem like solid devices. We got some alone time with those two, starting with the Pixel 2 XL, which we think is the more interesting device. Here are our thoughts on the matter.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google pixel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "htc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pixel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google android hands-on introduction  google", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "just black \u0095 black & white google pixel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorilla glass camera", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "misc", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T23:35:48.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "16af437a56c768990d1fdaf3bd5fe743f7e3da05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRJ1SqriX_mz9ujeNOu4D4scG8SRDRQaEaFRi2378d21w.iI4Vf89xNdTDDvHwLSXWpnogtU2xd2pkLzKA2UE9QtrbcMNZ4bGHEjW9YXNcV25ve8okNu9Ztzlbgny2EAYacmT.kf4i9RQ--", "site_full": "www.gsmarena.com", "site": "gsmarena.com", "site_section": "http://www.gsmarena.com/rss-news-reviews.php3", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "GSMArena.com - Latest articles", "title": "Made for Google certified accessories debut, initially from 26 partners", "title_full": "Made for Google certified accessories debut, initially from 26 partners", "published": "2017-10-04T23:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/17/10/made-for-google/-728x314/gsmarena_001.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 365, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 11, "comments": 0, "shares": 11}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "16af437a56c768990d1fdaf3bd5fe743f7e3da05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRJ1SqriX_mz9ujeNOu4D4scG8SRDRQaEaFRi2378d21w.iI4Vf89xNdTDDvHwLSXWpnogtU2xd2pkLzKA2UE9QtrbcMNZ4bGHEjW9YXNcV25ve8okNu9Ztzlbgny2EAYacmT.kf4i9RQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T23:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Made for Google certified accessories debut, initially from 26 partners", "text": "Google Android Mobile accessories \nStarting today, the Made for Google program for certified accessories makes its debut.

But does the newly revived Nokia brand still retain the same traits now that it's slapped onto Android smartphones? If we go by a durability test undergone by the Nokia 6 , then the answer is a resounding yes. \nBut what about the new flagship? We're talking about the Nokia 8 , of course. To find out how durable it is, leave it to YouTube channel JerryRigEverything to perform a comprehensive torture test, as usual. Here it is, embedded below for your viewing pleasure. \nIn case you can't watch the video, here are the highlights. The front glass scratches exactly as easily as you'd expect Gorilla Glass 5 to, no surprises there. Similarly, when a flame is applied to the screen the pixels it touches go black after ten seconds, but since it's an LCD they fully recover once the flame is extinguished. \nThe back of the phone is aluminum, which means a razor blade will scratch and damage it. The entire back camera section (which also features the LED flash) is covered by glass, so it won't scratch as easily as if it were plastic. \nMoving on to the most important part, the Nokia 8 does not bend. Not from the front, not from the back. This despite the fact that it uses 6000 series aluminum, which Apple had to give up on and replace with a 7000 series alloy in order to not have its handsets bend. The shape of the aluminum inside the Nokia 8 contributes to its durability. So for now, Nokia's legacy is intact - at least from this point of view.

However, the phones aren't exclusive to Big Red in any way. Not only can you also buy them from Fi, Google's own carrier, but they will be available for purchase through the Google Store too. \nIf you do want to get your Pixel fix from Verizon, though, you can now pre-order both models. The 64GB Pixel 2 is $27.08 per month with a two-year installment plan, while the 128GB version requires $31.24 each month. The 64GB Pixel 2 XL is priced at $35.42 per month, and the 128GB model can be yours if you part with $39.58 every month. \nIf you buy either phone, you receive a new Google Home Mini for free (which ships 2-4 weeks after activation). When you get a Pixel 2 or 2 XL on device payment, and you trade in an eligible smartphone, you can get up to $300 off. \nVerizon will also sell the Pixel Buds headphones starting on November 16. The new Daydream View headset goes on pre-order later today, alongside the Google Home Mini. \nLike last year, T-Mobile has decided to troll Verizon with a Pixel offer of its own , banking on the fact that even the Pixels sold by Big Red are unlocked and can be used with any network - including T-Mobile's of course. \nSo if you port in a number or activate a new line of service (in both cases on the T-Mobile One plan), you will be mailed a prepaid MasterCard with $325 on it. You just need to enter your details at a special activation website. Existing TMo customers can benefit too, when they add a line of T-Mobile One or Simple Choice Unlimited. \nYou must register for the offer and add the new rate plan to your account within 30 days of your Pixel purchase, and you need to show T-Mobile your proof of purchase. Note that you have to be the original device owner, so buying from eBay or Craigslist doesn't count - use Verizon or the Google Store.

Here\u0092s the breakdown, courtesy of AppBrain (an ad network). Note that these numbers are for Android phones only, the iPhones are not included. \nIn the US , a prime market for Samsung, the S8 duo has 5.8% combined, about half what the S7 generation has (10.3%). The older S5 is at 4.6%. In Canada , the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge have a total of 12.6% while S8\u0092s combined share is under 5%. In both countries, the smaller S7 is the top individual device. \nNot so in the UK where the S7 edge is on top. The total share of the 2016 generation is a whopping 15.4% compared to 6% for the 2017 models. In Germany , the Galaxy S8+ has below 2% share while the S8 stands at 3.1%. The S8 phones proved popular in Switzerland (8.6%), Norway and Sweden (both 6.8%). \nIn a surprising twist, the Galaxy J3 (2016) is the top Android in France , though the S7 and S7 edge combined beat it \u0096 4.1% vs. 7.4%. The S8 duo isn\u0092t even in the Top 10. Same for Spain and Italy . Curious thing about Italy \u0096 according to AppBrain, the top Android smartphone in the country is the Galaxy S III (4.2%), followed by the S7 edge (3.7%). What a generation gap! \nVenturing further east, South Korea holds on tightly to its Note5 units (7.8%) while the new Galaxy S8 phones have a combined 4.7% share. That is surprising since Samsung\u0092s home market is usually strong for the tech giant. \nHit the Source link if you want to check other countries or devices.

Yet here we are 24 hours later bringing you the first ever deal on the company's new smartphone duo. Best Buy already lets you save up to $100 when you purchase a Pixel 2, but there are some noteworthy caveats. \nFirst off, only the Pixel 2 is $100 off. The Pixel 2 XL is discounted too, but just by a mere $25. Next up, you need to know that these are Verizon Pixels we're talking about, and to take advantage of the price reduction you're going to have to pay for them using the carrier's installment plan. Google Pixel 2 \nIf you're okay with all of that, then your monthly installments for the Pixel 2 will be $22.91 (for the 64GB version) or $27.08 (for the 128GB model). Over the course of two years, you'll pay a grand total of $549.84 or $649.92, respectively - in each case, a few cents over $100 less than normal. \nIf you're interested in the Pixel 2 XL, the installments will be $34.36 per month (64GB) or $38.53 per month (128GB).

On December 15, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) will be no more. Oath officially announced the sad news today.

It's probably a good time for it to be put out of its misery, though. \nAIM started out as the built-in chat app inside America Online's desktop client. It took off (at least in the US) in 1997, when it became a separate standalone application.

The Android security patch is the August 1 one. \nT-Mobile, on the other hand, has issued a new firmware for the Tab E 8.0, but since that's the one version the carrier is selling, there's no Tab E 9.6 on T-Mobile to be releasing an update for. The Un-carrier doesn't go into specifics on the changelog, but should be pretty similar to Verizon's. \nAs usual, if you don't get the update over the air, head over to the source links below where you can download the files and flash them from your computer.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "oreo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "t-mobile", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "verizon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "t-mobile   t-mobile verizon  verizon", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "samsung ux", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T16:27:46.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e34409de47b32213f0288ad2d9e443ca9e74743c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRJ1SqriX_mz9ujeNOu4D4sG2YTViGjDmrFjcCchUTV8KyysoqwWW2jNROjjj2V.MgHQGrnQjcgEzvZU19YU299y4HUjOQDQryw5Xl8iV6tY5GAWS0ck5wPQKMxc8e8.CwsUNMoFhVtAw--", "site_full": "www.gsmarena.com", "site": "gsmarena.com", "site_section": "http://www.gsmarena.com/rss-news-reviews.php3", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "GSMArena.com - Latest articles", "title": "Android makers looking into 3D sensing, under-display fingerprint readers sidelined", "title_full": "Android makers looking into 3D sensing, under-display fingerprint readers sidelined", "published": "2017-10-07T16:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/17/10/android-makers-3d-sensing/-476x249w4/gsmarena_001.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 365, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 36, "comments": 0, "shares": 36}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e34409de47b32213f0288ad2d9e443ca9e74743c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRJ1SqriX_mz9ujeNOu4D4sG2YTViGjDmrFjcCchUTV8KyysoqwWW2jNROjjj2V.MgHQGrnQjcgEzvZU19YU299y4HUjOQDQryw5Xl8iV6tY5GAWS0ck5wPQKMxc8e8.CwsUNMoFhVtAw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-07T16:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Android makers looking into 3D sensing, under-display fingerprint readers sidelined", "text": "Samsung Apple Android \nThe under-display fingerprint reader may end up being replaced before it even becomes mainstream, at least in high-end smartphones, if a report by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is right on the money. According to the paper, Android phone makers are looking into 3D mapping solutions for facial recognition in the wake of the iPhone X announcement with similar tech. \nThe inquiries by smartphone manufacturers into 3D sensing have more than tripled since the announcement of the iPhone X, the analyst reports. In addition to the security applications, these technologies allow for augmented reality use, as Apple has demonstrated with the Animoji, and are therefore seen as a novelty rather than an incremental upgrade that under-display readers appear to the user. FaceID on the iPhone X \nUnder-glass fingerprint recognition has been a few years in the making, yet it's still not ready for prime time apparently, resulting in last-minute solutions like the less than ideal placement of conventional sensors that we've seen on Samsung's latest Galaxy S8 and Note8 smartphones. Apple itself was rumored to be working on an optical under-display sensor for the iPhone X before shifting to 3D sensing. \nAnd while Samsung may persevere with optical fingerprint recognition as it's better suited to OLED displays - a market the company dominates, other makers may be switching to 3D mapping systems altogether to avoid component shortages. \nMeanwhile, Kuo reports, Samsung has settled on a compact image sensor (CIS) design for the Galaxy Note9's under-glass fingerprint sensor (so it is coming after all, probably) as opposed to a \"CIS+independent light emitter\" setup. That's been made possible due to the fact that Samsung's flexible OLED panels can be customized to fit CIS-only designs, whereas rigid OLEDs by competing manufacturers out of China require the auxiliary light source.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kuo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ming-chi kuo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "animoji", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T17:45:40.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "797a9ebe017337ddb385a552d171fe14570d627c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRJ1SqriX_mz9ujeNOu4D4sz5G93kpqcSbCH4V6NkCKCvzNLQqaq2avGD5xM6UUhJ13_FbIphCsu2vcgMdi0byoFFpGQTryogRFH4H8JOjicw--", "site_full": "www.gsmarena.com", "site": "gsmarena.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Red announces the new Monstro 8K VV sensor - GSMArena.com news", "title_full": "Red announces the new Monstro 8K VV sensor - GSMArena.com news", "published": "2017-10-07T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.201, "main_image": "https://cdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/17/10/red-monstro/-476x249w4/gsmarena_001.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 365, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 27, "comments": 0, "shares": 27}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "797a9ebe017337ddb385a552d171fe14570d627c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRJ1SqriX_mz9ujeNOu4D4sz5G93kpqcSbCH4V6NkCKCvzNLQqaq2avGD5xM6UUhJ13_FbIphCsu2vcgMdi0byoFFpGQTryogRFH4H8JOjicw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-07T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Red announces the new Monstro 8K VV sensor - GSMArena.com news", "text": "RED Digital cameras \nHigh-end cinema camera manufacturer Red has announced the new Monstro 8K VV sensor for its Weapon series of cameras.

Well, you come up with something in the middle. Enter the 5.5\" Xperia XA1 Plus, which is perfectly bridging the gap between the 5-inch XA1 and the 6-inch XA1 Ultra. \nThe Xperia XA1 Plus bridges other gaps too, though. For one, it's got a fingerprint reader on the side, just like on the higher-end XZ series, while the XA1 and the Ultra sacrificed that for minimal side bezels. \nAnd just because the screen diagonal of the Plus is the mean of the other two, it doesn't imply the battery capacity is thereabout too. Oh no, the XA1 Plus boasts a plus-size battery. The 3,430mAh capacity of the Plus is 27% more than what the 6-inch Ultra has. Couple that with the efficient 16nm Helio P20 chipset and you're in for some excellent endurance numbers. \nThere are no surprises to be expected in the camera department. The XA1 Plus shares the primary cam with the other two: there's a high-res 23MP large sensor unit inherited from last generation's flagships. As for selfies, it's the XA1's 8MP cam that you'll find on the Plus, and not the Ultra's 16MP shooter. No flash either. \nAll the rest is very much in line with the other XA1s, but you can always refer to the next few lines for a quick refresher.

There's a 5.5-inch display on the front, and the lack of resolution in the specs points to 720p. \nIt becomes clear where the 'Lite' in the Zenfone 4 Selfie Lite's name comes from when you look at the chipset - it's the Snapdragon 425 with a quad-core Cortex-A53 CPU. The two other plain Selfies feature the S430 (8x1.4GHz Cortex-A53), while the Selfie Pro is in a different league with its S625 (8x2.0GHz Cortex-A53).

The Meizu Pro 7 switched it up a bit with a second AMOLED screen on its back, but we\u0092ve covered second screens before. But a modern smartphone doubles up on more than just the screen. \nTwo cameras are a staple of new flagships, for example. That was a thing way back in 2011 with the HTC EVO 3D and the LG Optimus 3D . The two cams were used for stereoscopic photos and videos back then. Today the second cam has either a wide or a tele lens, perhaps the sensor it uses skips the Bayer filter for improved low-light performance. Two cameras are better than one \nHow about a phone with two 3.5mm headphone jacks \u0096 like the Marshall London . Two! The iPhone X and Pixel 2 don\u0092t have even one! Besides allowing a friend to listen to your music without a headphone splitter, the jacks could be used for recording musical instruments \u0096 a music studio on the go. Two headphone jacks are better than none \nThe Innos D6000 had two batteries \u0096 2,480mAh + 3,520mAh \u0096 which allowed you to hot swap batteries. Alternatively, you can take out the second battery and leave it to charge while you continue to use the phone untethered. Double the batteries, double the power \nStereo speakers are fairly common these days, but it\u0092s not enough to have two of the same type of speaker. No, good audio demands two types of speakers \u0096 a tweeter and a woofer. While not built in, HTC\u0092s BoomBass was a protable subwoofer that added much needed bass to the small speakers of a Desire 601 or 300 . All about the bass \nSpeaking of two types of things, what happened to xenon flashes? We know what happened \u0096 they are too thick for the modern sub-8mm phone. Still, a xenon flash was invaluable in nighttime photography. The last smartphone we find to have xenon is 2014\u0092s Samsung Galaxy K zoom , which was more camera than phone. \nA ring flash like on the Acer Liquid S2 was an interesting concept too. It had four LEDs, but they were separated (placed around the camera), which provided a more even illumination with fewer shadows cast. There are two kinds of flash in the world \nWhat else could be doubled for a better smartphone? Double USB ports perhaps. Microsoft\u0092s Continuum and Samsung\u0092s DeX won\u0092t need a dock if the first USB-C port provided DisplayPort while the second took in a keyboard/mouse dongle. Can you think of anything else?

It seems that the shipping estimates shot up almost instantly, especially for the Black & White color option for the Pixel 2 XL (affectionately known as the panda color). Does that mean Google\u0092s new phones are excellent and already top sellers? No, in typical Google fashion it did not stock up enough units so it could be December before you get to own your panda XL. \nYou can check our hands-on and watch our encounter on video . We don\u0092t make much of a secret that we think the larger model is the better phone. \nThe chunky bezels of the smaller Pixel 2 makes it feel out of place among late 2017 flagships. And it\u0092s not a cheap device either, especially outside the US ($650 we can swallow, \u0080800 is just too much). Both phones have mostly identical hardware, with the exception of the screen. \nPixel 2 XL won us over with a modern 18:9 screen \u0096 with QHD+ resolution to boot, not 1080p (hello, 2013). Both support Always On Display, but the larger screen has better color accuracy \u0096 100% DCI-P3 vs. 95%. Not much of a difference, but enough for you to know you\u0092re not getting the best. \nA bigger issue is that Google decided against a dual camera. We do love the addition of OIS and Dual Pixel AF and the image quality looks great. But no amount of software processing will give us optical zoom or a wide-angle view. \nAnyway, allow us to vent about the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack \u0096 and this after making fun of Apple last year! You get a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter in the box, but if you lose it, a new one will cost you $20 (double what Apple\u0092s adapters cost).

We're talking about a fingerprint sensor that sits under the display. Such an optical sensor is likely to appear in the Note9 according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, a legendary purveyor of mostly Apple-related mumblings. \nIf this pans out, the unlocking procedure will probably go something like this: you simply place your finger onto a specific part of the handset's screen, and that's it. Both Samsung and Apple have tried to get this into products shipping in 2017, but both failed.
