Travel impacts occurred, along with tree damage and power outages. \nThe first blizzard of the season resulted in widespread power outages and downed trees in parts of Montana. Treacherous travel conditions and additional power outages were also observed across other portions of the northern and central Rockies as an early-season snowstorm swept through the region. \n(MORE: Winter Storm Central ) \nUnlike the snow the Rockies experienced in September, this storm had a greater impact since valley locations were also affected, in addition to typical mountain areas. \nHavre, Montana, had seen 13 inches of heavy, wet snow as of late Tuesday afternoon, which set a new record for heaviest two-day October snowfall total at the Havre City-County Airport. The previous two-day October record was 12.6 inches , which was set in 1898. Due to power outages, further investigation will be needed to determine if any daily records were broken in Havre. \nMany large tree branches were downed, and all of Havre was without power , the Hill County Sheriff reported around 10 p.m. MDT Monday. \nAccording to the National Weather Service in Great Falls, Montana, this storm was effectively a blizzard in the Havre area, especially considering the severe impacts. A blizzard occurs when the following conditions are met for at least three consecutive hours: sustained winds or frequent gusts to at least 35 mph and considerable falling and/or blowing snow that frequently reduces visibility to less than a quarter mile. \nElsewhere, Zortman, Montana set a new one day record for October with 14 inches of snow reported Tuesday morning. \nWhile not a record, Missoula, Montana recorded .10 inches of snow Monday night, which is the earliest recorded measurable snow there in 34 yrs. \nThe heaviest estimated snow amount from this storm is 30 inches in Rocky Boy, Montana. Drifts in at least one location were estimated to be eight feet high. \nTop snowfall totals as of Tuesday evening include: 30 inches in Rocky Boy, Montana 20.4 inches near Encampment, Wyoming 18 inches near Steamboat Springs, Colorado 16 inches near Cameron Pass, Colorado 15.8 inches near Havre, Montana Up to 15 inches near Breckenridge, Colorado 14 inches at the Vail Pass rest area on Interstate 70 in Colorado 14 inches near Redcliff, Colorado 14 inches in Zortman, Montana 14 inches in Cut Bank, Montana 13 inches in Havre, Montana (Havre City-County Airport) 13 inches near Rand, Colorado 12 inches near Laramie, Wyoming 10 inches near Avon, Colorado \nThe snow first affected the Colorado Rockies Sunday night into Monday. \nInterstate 70 was closed in Colorado between Vail and Copper Mountain for a time Monday morning due to accidents and vehicles sliding off the icy road. Shelters were opened to take in stranded travelers in the area. \nMore than a foot of snow accumulated in many locations, including an estimated 14 inches of snow that was measured at the Vail Pass rest area on Interstate 70 as of Monday morning. \nSeveral ski resorts in the high country of Colorado expressed their excitement about the snow. \nLoveland Ski Area provided this image showing how the snow had piled up on their measuring platform at an elevation of 10,894 feet before power was knocked out there. More than a foot of snow had been measured at that location by early Monday. \n(MORE: When Does Winter Storm Season Typically Start? ) \nAt Steamboat Resort in Colorado, their webcam captured 19 inches of snow piling up \u2013 the heaviest early-October snowstorm on record at the ski area. \nIn southeast Wyoming, the first snowflakes of the season were observed in Cheyenne on Monday morning. This coincides with the date of when the average first measurable snow has historically occurred in Cheyenne \u2013 Oct. 2. \nHeavy snow was observed in northwest Wyoming on Togwotee Pass, where around 2 feet of snow had piled up by Monday evening. \n\nThe Weather Company\u2019s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

The space agency collected the images to help first responders pinpoint where power is out so that they can act accordingly. \nMore than a week after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, much of the island\u2019s power grid remains offline, and recently released NASA satellite images show the extent of the outages. \nThe before-and-after images show regions within the territory that are still without power in comparison to regular nights before the storm hit. Taken on Sept. 27 and Sept. 29, they show a dramatic decrease in lights from human activity due to the widespread outages. \nNASA collected the images to help first responders pinpoint where power is out so that they can act accordingly. \n\u201cIn circumstances like this, quickly knowing where the power is out\u2014and how long it has been out\u2014 allows first responders to better deploy rescue and repair crews and to distribute life-saving supplies ,\u201d NASA researchers wrote in a post on the images. \u201cAnd that is exactly why teams of scientists at NASA are working long days to make sure that groups like the National Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) get high-quality satellite maps of power outages in Puerto Rico.\u201d \n(MORE: Trump Travels to Hurricane-Ravaged Puerto Rico ) \nThe images are based on data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) \u201cday-night band,\u201d which spots light in various wavelengths such as green to near-infrared, according to NASA. It can also detect light from fires, lightning, reflected moonlight and emissions from cities. \nIn order to make the VIIRS data more useful for the first responders, NASA\u2019s researchers scaled their observations onto a base map that highlights streets and neighborhoods. They also processed and corrected the data to filter out any light that did not come from an electric source, which helped remove other possible interferences such as cloud cover, haze and dust. \n\u201cIt is critical that we get this processing done quickly, so that we can provide the cleanest and most useful imagery to the National Guard, FEMA, and other first responders,\u201d NASA Goddard Space Flight Center researcher Miguel Rom\u00e1n said in the post. \u201cUncorrected images can be misleading because of things like cloud cover and changing moonlight conditions.\u201d \nEarlier images released by the European Space Agency showed a bird's-eye view of Maria's destruction of the power grid. \nThe before photo, taken around 2 a.m. on July 24, shows a brightly lit island with a near solid football of light surrounding the capital of San Juan. The second photo, taken around the same time of night, but five days after the storm made landfall, looks nearly pitch black with just a few points of light differentiating an island of some 3 million people from the dark water surrounding it. \nHurricane Maria smashed poles, snarled power lines and flooded electricity-generating plants when it hit on Sept. 20, knocking out a grid that was already considered antiquated compared to the U.S. mainland. \nThere are more than a dozen power plants on the island and they suffered some damage, but that's not the biggest problem. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or Prepa, had more than 2,400 miles of major transmission lines and more than 30,000 miles of smaller distribution wires the connect homes and businesses to the grid. \nPublic Affairs Secretary Ramon Rosario said 80 percent of the island's transmission and distribution lines were knocked down.

More on Central American Gyres \nThis possible tropical depression or storm will originate on the eastern end of a larger feature, currently forming in the far western Caribbean, called a Central American gyre . \nThis \"gyre\" is a large, broad area of low pressure over the Central American isthmus and western Caribbean Sea. This feature can lead to the development of a tropical cyclone in the Caribbean Sea and/or in the eastern Pacific Ocean. \nThese gyres most often form in the late spring and early fall, when cold fronts become uncommon in this region of the world. They're most common in September, but can be a source of tropical storms and hurricanes into November, and as early as May. \nWe typically see up to two gyres like this one set up each year, and they can spawn tropical storms in both the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins, sometimes in each basin at the same time. Not all gyres produce tropical cyclones, but they all produce heavy rainfall. \nRoughly 50 percent of Central American gyres have a tropical cyclone associated with them, according to Philippe Papin , Ph.D. candidate at the University of Albany. \"When a tropical cyclone does occur, it tends to form on the eastern side of the [gyre] and rotates counterclockwise around the larger circulation.\" \nGyre-like tropical systems are much more common in the western Pacific closer to southeast Asia, where the monsoon plays a larger role in the weather. \nA notable example of gyre-induced tropical cyclone formation occurred in 2010 when Tropical Storm Nicole formed just south of Cuba from the gyre in late September. \nNicole was a short-lived and ill-formed tropical storm that tried to cross Cuba. It brought heavy rain to the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, Cuba and portions of South Florida. \nHurricane Stan in 2005 is another good example of a hurricane's interaction with a Central American Gyre, according to Papin. \nFollowing Stan's dissipation over the mountains of central Mexico, its remnant spin became part of a larger gyre that caused heavy rainfall over Central America. While Stan's direct circulation resulted in around 80 deaths, according to the National Hurricane Center , heavy rainfall resulting from the gyre took more than 1,000 lives across Central America. \nOther examples include Tropical Storm Andrea (2013), Hurricane Ida (2009 \u2013 assist from the gyre) and Hurricane Patricia (2015 \u2013 assist from the gyre, not a direct result). \nThe Weather Company\u2019s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

In the Sept. 1, 2017, photo above, some rises from the Arkema Inc. chemical plant in Crosby, Texas, after flooding from Hurricane Harvey triggered an explosion. Residents living near the facility have filed a lawsuit against the company after test results detected toxic substances in soil, water and ash samples taken from their homes. (KTRK via AP) At a Glance Residents of Crosby, Texas, have filed a lawsuit against a chemical plant that flooded, caught fire and partially exploded during Hurricane Harvey. They say the explosion has lead to health issues and strange black ash and residue in the neighborhood. The lawsuit claims the facility did not take proper precautions to control flooding and did not warn residents about health risks from the site's explosion. \nAfter toxic substances were detected in soil, water and ash samples taken from residents\u2019 property in Crosby, Texas, a class action lawsuit was filed against a nearby chemical plant that flooded during Hurricane Harvey, caught fire and partially exploded. \nThe lawsuit filed Tuesday named 15 residents as plaintiffs and links the toxins to products stored or made at Arkema Inc.'s facility in the area, about 25 miles northeast of Houston. It claims the releases from the products violated environmental protection laws. \nThe residents blame Arkema and its France-based parent company for not taking more precautions to control flooding at the facility, which falls within a government-designated flood plain, and for failing to fully warn them about the health risks of smoke and water from the site. \nAccording to the lawsuit, one woman's two daughters had respiratory trouble and headaches after moving back into their home, where the toxins were found. Another plaintiff, Shannan Wheeler, told The Associated Press that he found gooey black deposits in his flower beds and developed a thick, scaly rash while picking up grass clippings after mowing following the final fire. \n\"The third or fourth scoopful, I noticed the stinging, the tingling,\" said Wheeler, noting that his doctor told him scarring was likely. \"The next one was like, 'Damn it.' I thought I'd gotten in ants. It started getting red. I kept picking up. After two more, I said that's enough, something's wrong here.\" \n(MORE: The Diseases Puerto Ricans May Have to Contend With After Maria ) \nIn a written statement Tuesday, Arkema said it hasn't detected chemicals in off-site sampling that exceeds levels for clean-up set by the state's environmental agency. \n\"We don't know what these lawyers tested for,\" the company wrote, saying that it wouldn't comment further on the lawsuit. \nThe company has previously declined to say which chemicals were released during the fire or discuss how large its inventory quantities were prior to the incident. It provided only the names of its chemicals on its website last month after days of public pressure. \nArkema's legal troubles have widened in the past week. The civil attorney and the criminal district attorney for Harris County, which includes Houston, announced a pending lawsuit and investigation. \nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and U.S. Chemical Safety Board announced last month that they were investigating. \nAbout two dozen homeowners and first responders are part of a state lawsuit that seeks more than $1 million. They also blame Arkema for sickening them and failing to fully warn them about the hazards. \nArkema executives have insisted that they planned for flooding conditions, bringing in backup generators and moving containers with the chemicals to higher ground. Accident plans the company had filed with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in recent years noted that hurricanes, flooding and power loss were potential hazards, but it didn't explain what it would do if faced with them. \nDespite a National Hurricane Center warning on Aug. 27 that areas around Houston could get 50 inches (130 centimeters) of rain, company officials said they couldn't have predicted the unprecedented flooding. \nAs Harvey dumped the rain, Arkema's power and generators at its Crosby facility failed, leading refrigeration systems to shut down. That caused its organic peroxides, used in a range of products from plastics and paints, to destabilize. \nArkema abandoned the facility Aug. 29 after, executives have said, as much as 6 feet (1.8 meters) engulfed it. A mandatory 1.5-mile (2.4-kilometer) evacuation zone was created in anticipation of a fire and explosion, displacing hundreds of residents for about a week. \nAfter one container storing hazardous materials caught fire Aug. 31 and exploded, an Arkema executive claimed that smoke from that was a \"non-toxic irritant.\" Fifteen responders were treated for exposure at local hospitals. \nOn Sept. 4, after a second container caught fire and then the remaining others were burned under supervision, an executive said Arkema's air-quality testing within the evacuation zone had shown \"no evidence of any issues.\" \n(MORE: Open Not the Same as Normal: Florida Keys Still Struggling ) \nBut the class-action lawsuit, filed in a Houston federal court, said several residents had found \"strange black ash\" and \"black residue\" on the ground after each Arkema explosion sent plumes of smoke in the air. \nScientific testing of samples \u2014collected up to 6 miles away \u2014 found materials from multiple families of toxic chemicals, according to the suit. \nThe toxins identified include volatile organic compounds, which can cause cancer, and harmful polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons formed during the incomplete burning of organic substances. The lawsuit said tests also detected dioxins and furans, which the EPA has said may change hormone levels in those exposed. \n\"Given the toxicity of the substances released,\" according to the lawsuit, \"the 1.5-mile perimeter was not far enough to adequately protect either first responders or those living beyond the perimeter who were not evacuated.\" \nIn 2016, an analysis led by Texas A&M University researchers identified Arkema's facility as one of the biggest risks in a corridor with the country's greatest concentration of petrochemical plants. \nState and federal regulators have penalized the plant multiple times in the last decade. In June 2006, for example, Arkema failed to prevent unauthorized emissions during a two-hour warehouse fire. In February, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined Arkema more than $90,000 for of 10 serious safety violations found during an inspection.

Nate will make its closest approach to Canc\u00fan and Cozumel Friday night, where a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning is in effect. Preparations should be rushed to completion in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Nate will then make landfall along the northern Gulf Coast late Saturday night or early Sunday as either a hurricane or a tropical storm. Hurricane and storm surge watches have been issued for the U.S. northern Gulf Coast. Nate will produce a swath of heavy rain from the Gulf Coast to the Appalachians and possibly parts of the Northeast. Torrential rain will also trigger serious flash flooding and mudslides in much of Central America the next few days. \nTropical Storm Nate is now back over the warm water of the northwest Caribbean Sea, poised for a strike on Canc\u00fan and Cozumel tonight, then on the northern Gulf Coast Saturday night and Sunday, where hurricane watches have been posted. Happening Now \nNate's center is currently about 230 miles south-southeast of Cozumel, Mexico, moving north-northwest about 15 mph. \nHeavy rain continues to fall across parts of Central America and clusters of thunderstorms have also pushed well east and northeast of Nate's center toward the Cayman Islands and Cuba. \nTropical storm force winds have expanded to reach up to 90 miles mainly to the east of the center. Watches and Warnings \nA hurricane watch and tropical storm warning have been issued for Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula from Punta Herrero to Rio Lagartos \u2013 including Canc\u00fan and Cozumel \u2013 meaning hurricane conditions are possible and tropical storm conditions are expected. \nTropical storm warnings have also been issued for parts of the Caribbean coast of Honduras \u2013 from the Nicaragua/Honduras border to Punta Castilla, Honduras \u2013 meaning tropical storm conditions will continue for the next several hours. \nA hurricane watch is in effect for portions of the northern Gulf Coast in the U.S. from Morgan City, Louisiana to the Alabama/Mississippi border including the New Orleans metro area, Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas. This means hurricane conditions are possible, in this case within 36 to 48 hours. \nA storm surge watch has been issued portions of the northern Gulf Coast in the U.S. from Morgan City, Louisiana to the Alabama/Mississippi border including the northern and western shores of Lake Pontchartrain. This means there's a threat of life-threatening storm surge inundation associated with Nate. \nA tropical storm watch has been issued from the Mississippi/Alabama border eastward to the Okaloosa/Walton County line in Florida and from Morgan City, Louisiana westward to Intercoastal City, Louisiana. This means tropical storm conditions are possible, in this case within 36 to 48 hours. Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, Central America Forecast \nEnvironmental conditions are favorable for additional strengthening over the northwest Caribbean Sea. \nWater temperatures are currently in the mid- to upper 80s, about 2 to 5 degrees above average, and wind shear may lessen a bit. \n(MORE: September 2017 Was the Most Active Month on Record for Atlantic Hurricanes ) \nNate will make its closest approach to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula \u2013 including Canc\u00fan and Cozumel \u2013 tonight, as either a tropical storm or low-end hurricane. \nBands of locally heavy rain will pick up during the day in the Yucatan Peninsula, making any last-minute preparations difficult. Tropical storm-force winds could arrive by evening, and surf will gradually build. \nA storm surge of 1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels is expected with the closest pass of the center of Nate tonight along the northeast Yucatan Peninsula. \nParts of the Yucatan Peninsula could pick up 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated totals as high as 8 inches, leading to flash flooding through Saturday. \nAreas of locally heavy rain from a larger-scale \"Central American gyre\" (again, more on this feature below) are likely to persist at least into part of the weekend in parts of Central America and far southeast Mexico. \nHere are the latest rainfall forecasts from the National Hurricane Center: Southern Honduras, western Nicaragua: 6 to 10 inches, with isolated 15-inch totals Eastern El Salvador, northern to central Honduras: 3 to 5 inches, with isolated 8-inch totals Western Cuba: 2 to 4 inches Eastern Belize and the Cayman Islands: 1 to 3 inches \nThis torrential rain may trigger dangerous flash flooding and mudslides, particularly over the mountainous terrain of Central America. \n( MORE: 2017 Already a Top 10 Most Active Hurricane Season ) U.S. Impact This Weekend \nNate's center will make landfall along the northern Gulf Coast, between southeast Louisiana and the far western Florida panhandle, late Saturday night or early Sunday. \nThis landfall will most likely be as either a low-end hurricane or strong tropical storm. There remains some typical uncertainty in both the exact track of the center and its intensity. \n( MORE: Recent Cat. 1 Gulf Hurricanes Have Been More Destructive Than You Might Think ) \nHere's a timeline of events with this system, regarding the U.S. Gulf Coast: Saturday: Last hours to prepare; swells arrive along the northern Gulf Coast with some coastal flooding may already occur at high tide; outer rainbands arrive at the coast and spread inland Saturday night: Damaging, hurricane-force winds possible in hurricane watch areas; landfall expected overnight with storm surge flooding in surge flood watch areas and bands of heavy rain; worst of the impacts likely to the north and east of the center track. Sunday morning: Again, landfall could occur in pre-dawn hours with storm surge flooding, hurricane or tropical storm-force winds near and east of the center; areas of heavy rain spread into other parts of the Southeast. Sunday afternoon/night: Nate weakens over the Tennessee Valley with some lingering gusty winds but heavy, potentially flooding rain spreading into the Appalachians. Monday: Lingering heavy rain, flash flooding possible in the Appalachians and parts of the Northeast. \n( INTERACTIVE MAP: Nate Forecast Path ) \nTo emphasize, preparations should be completed, if possible, by Friday in the hurricane watch area, as conditions (outer rainbands, some at least minor coastal flooding at high tide) will go downhill already on Saturday. \nA swath of 3 to 5 inches of rain, with locally higher amounts, is expected not just near the landfall area along the Gulf Coast this weekend, but also well inland through Monday into the Tennessee Valley and Appalachians. \nThis may trigger serious inland flash flooding Sunday into Monday in the Appalachians, as happens often with inland tropical cyclones. \nOther parts of the Ohio Valley and Northeast may also see some heavy rain, depending on the path of Nate's inland remnant. Recap \nThis latest tropical system originated on the eastern end of a larger feature, called a Central American gyre . \nEnough spin and thunderstorm activity was collected east of Nicaragua on Oct. 4 that the National Hurricane Center upgraded Invest 90L to a tropical depression. Heavy rain partially from the gyre and from newly upgraded Tropical Depression 16 spread across Central America. \nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, Nate was upgraded from a tropical depression on the morning of Oct. 5 based on radar from San Andr\u00e9s, an island east of Nicaragua, indicating a partial eyewall and a surface pressure measurement over Nicaragua found to be lower than previous advisories. Nate moved ashore over northeastern Nicaragua later that day. What Spawned This? More on Central American Gyres \nThis \"gyre\" is a large, broad area of low pressure over the Central American isthmus and western Caribbean Sea. This feature can lead to the development of a tropical cyclone in the Caribbean Sea and/or in the eastern Pacific Ocean. \nThese gyres most often form in the late spring and early fall, when cold fronts become uncommon in this region of the world. They're most common in September, but can be a source of tropical storms and hurricanes into November, and as early as May. \nWe typically see up to two gyres like this one set up each year, and they can spawn tropical storms in both the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins, sometimes in each basin at the same time. Not all gyres produce tropical cyclones, but they all produce heavy rainfall. \nRoughly 50 percent of Central American gyres have a tropical cyclone associated with them, according to Philippe Papin , Ph.D. candidate at the University of Albany. \"When a tropical cyclone does occur, it tends to form on the eastern side of the [gyre] and rotates counterclockwise around the larger circulation.\" \nGyre-like tropical systems are much more common in the western Pacific closer to southeast Asia, where the monsoon plays a larger role in the weather. \nA notable example of gyre-induced tropical cyclone formation occurred in 2010 when Tropical Storm Nicole formed just south of Cuba from the gyre in late September. \nNicole was a short-lived and ill-formed tropical storm that tried to cross Cuba. It brought heavy rain to the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, Cuba and portions of South Florida. \nHurricane Stan in 2005 is another good example of a hurricane's interaction with a Central American Gyre, according to Papin. \nFollowing Stan's dissipation over the mountains of central Mexico, its remnant spin became part of a larger gyre that caused heavy rainfall over Central America. While Stan's direct circulation resulted in around 80 deaths, according to the National Hurricane Center , heavy rainfall resulting from the gyre took more than 1,000 lives across Central America. \nOther examples include Tropical Storm Andrea (2013), Hurricane Ida (2009 \u2013 assist from the gyre) and Hurricane Patricia (2015 \u2013 assist from the gyre, not a direct result). \nThe Weather Company\u2019s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

He said the city is working with local, federal and state partners to identify the risks and vulnerabilities of the city and determine how to keep residents safe. \nEvacuation orders were expanded Friday in Louisiana. In Jefferson Parish, mandatory evacuations were ordered in Lafitte , according to WWL-TV. \n\"We do anticipate a direct hit in Louisiana,\" Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said in a statement obtained by the Associated Press. \"The bottom line for people is: You need to be where you want to be and in the posture you want to be by dark on Saturday.\" \nBel Edwards declared a state of emergency on Thursday. He announced 1,300 National Guard troops are being mobilized and 15 are heading to New Orleans to monitor the pumping system. A flood in early August revealed the pump issues across the Big Easy. \nOn Friday, Landrieu said 109 of the city's 120 pumps, or 92 percent, were working. \nOn Thursday, city officials met to discuss the status of the drainage systems. Repairs have been made , the New Orleans Times-Picayune reported, but not all of the turbine generators are fully operational yet. \n\"Since early August, we have made substantial progress,\" New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu told reporters Thursday. \nEvacuations were ordered in part of St. Bernard Parish located outside the levee protection system on Thursday, the AP reported. \nOfficials in Grand Isle, a barrier island south of New Orleans, issued a voluntary evacuation for residents. Other voluntary evacuations were issued for parts of Lafourche and St. John parishes, WWL-TV also said. \nThe city has almost 40 boats and more than 20 high-water vehicles and other rescue supplies staged at fire and police stations, and four high-water vehicles and two boats that the Emergency Medical Services headquarters, the release stated. The New Orleans Police Department has placed 146 barricades in flood-prone areas to keep motorists from driving into areas with high water. \nMississippi Gov. Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency for six counties in the southern portion of the state Friday afternoon. The declaration also covers any other counties impacted by the storm. \nState officials said they plan to open 11 shelters for evacuees and will run buses for residents who are unable to drive. \nDozens of offshore oil and gas platforms and drilling rigs in the Gulf were evacuated Friday ahead of the storm, the Associated Press reports. \nAt Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi, the Air Force Reserve's 403rd Wing announced it would relocate aircraft to bases in Texas and Arkansas because of the storm, according to an announcement made Friday afternoon. \n(MORE: Get the Latest Forecast for Nate ) \nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency Thursday for 29 counties in response to the storm. \n\"Tropical Storm Nate is headed north toward our state and Florida must be prepared,\" said Scott in the release. \"I have declared a state of emergency for 29 counties in Florida to make certain that state, federal and local governments are able to work together and ensure resources are dispersed to local communities. By declaring an emergency in these counties, we can also ensure that there is no hindrance in the transportation of supplies and assets.\" \nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey also declared a state of emergency Thursday in order to free up personnel and resources in case responders need to be dispatched for any storm-related activity, the AP reported. \nOn Thursday, a release from the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said the agency would evacuate platforms and rigs in the Gulf of Mexico ahead of the storm. Six of the 737 platforms in the Gulf were evacuated and one moveable rig was taken out of the path of the storm. \nDelta Air Lines announced it would issue travel waivers for customers traveling to several affected hubs.

Nate will then make landfall along the northern Gulf Coast late Saturday night or early Sunday as a Category 1 hurricane. Hurricane and storm surge warnings have been issued for the U.S. northern Gulf Coast including New Orleans. Nate will produce a swath of heavy rain from the Gulf Coast to the Appalachians and possibly parts of the Northeast. Torrential rain could continue to trigger serious flash flooding and mudslides in much of Central America the next few days. \nNate, now a Category 1 hurricane, is accelerating northward in the southern Gulf of Mexico with its sights on the northern Gulf Coast Saturday night and Sunday, where hurricane warnings have been posted. Nate quickly intensified on Friday and is expected to intensify further on Saturday. A period of rapid intensification is possible. \n( COMPLETE NATE COVERAGE: Hurricane Central ) Happening Now \nHurricane Hunters have found that maximum sustained winds have increased to 75 mph, which makes Nate a Category 1 hurricane. \nNate's center is currently less than 500 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River, moving rapidly north-northwest about 22 mph. \nHeavy rain continues to fall across parts of western Cuba and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Rain showers are occasionally passing through offshore Florida waters and the Florida Keys. \nTropical storm force winds have expanded to reach up to 125 miles mainly to the east of the center. Watches and Warnings \nA hurricane warning, meaning in this case hurricane conditions are expected in the area by Saturday night, is now in effect from Grand Isle, Louisiana, to the Alabama/Florida border including New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain. \nA storm surge warning has been posted from Morgan City, Louisiana, to the Okaloosa/Walton County line in Florida, including the northern and western shores of Lake Pontchartrain. This means a life-threatening inundation is likely in these areas with the landfall of Nate, in this case Saturday night into early Sunday. \n( MAPS: NHC Storm Surge Watch/Warning Areas ) \nA hurricane watch, meaning hurricane conditions are possible, is in effect for much of the rest of southeast Louisiana and the Florida Panhandle from the Alabama/Florida border to the Okaloosa/Walton County line. \nA tropical storm warning is in effect from Punta Hererro to Rio Lagartos on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, including Canc\u00fan and Cozumel . \nTropical storm warnings are in effect for a similar swath of southern Louisiana currently in a hurricane watch as far west as Morgan City, the same swath of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, and Pinar del Rio, Cuba. \nTropical storm watches extend west of the warnings to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and as far east as Indian Pass, Florida, as well as for Cuba's Isle of Youth. Tropical storm conditions could penetrate as far inland as central Alabama and northern Georgia. \nA storm surge watch extends east of the Alabama/Florida border to Indian Pass, Florida, meaning inundating, life-threatening storm surge is possible in that area. U.S. Forecast Timeline \nNate's center will make one or more landfalls along the northern Gulf Coast, between southeast Louisiana and the far western Florida panhandle, Saturday night into early Sunday, most likely as a Category 1 hurricane. \nDue to the complex geography in the northern Gulf Coast, a landfall point remains difficult to pinpoint, but the overall track will bring Nate through the northern Gulf Coast and into the Southeast this weekend. \n( MORE: Recent Cat. 1 Gulf Hurricanes Have Been More Destructive Than You Might Think ) \nHere's a timeline of events with this system, regarding the U.S. Gulf Coast: Saturday: Last hours to prepare; swells arrive along the northern Gulf Coast with some potential coastal flooding; outer rainbands arrive at the coast and spread inland; Tropical storm force winds arrive mid-late afternoon along the coast. Saturday night: Damaging, hurricane-force winds possible in hurricane warning and possibly in watch areas; landfall expected overnight with storm surge flooding in surge flood warning and possibly watch areas; bands of heavy rain; worst of the impacts likely to the north and east of the center track. Sunday morning: Again, landfall could occur in pre-dawn hours with storm surge flooding, hurricane or tropical storm-force winds near and east of the center; areas of heavy rain spread into other parts of the Southeast, southern Appalachians. Sunday afternoon/night: Nate weakens over the Tennessee Valley with some lingering gusty winds but heavy, potentially flooding rain continues in the Appalachians, Tennessee Valley. Monday: Lingering heavy rain, flash flooding possible in the Appalachians and parts of the Northeast. \nTo emphasize, preparations should be completed, if possible, by Friday in the hurricane and storm surge warning areas, as conditions (outer rainbands, some at least minor coastal flooding) will go downhill already on Saturday. U.S. Impacts \nStorm Surge \nCoastal flooding will already build ahead of Nate's arrival Saturday. \nThe peak storm surge will occur with the closest approach of the center of Nate Saturday night or early Sunday morning. \nHere are the potential peak water levels above ground you may see from storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center. This should be thought of as the worst-case flooding expected with Nate, if the storm surge arrives at high tide. \nUnfortunately, there is high tide during the overnight hours Saturday night as Nate's center draws near. Here are the times of high tide, in local time, for several locations that are expected to see storm surge flooding from Nate: Grand Isle, Louisiana: Saturday 11:31 p.m. Waveland, Mississippi: Sunday 1:20 a.m. Dauphin Island, Alabama: Saturday 11:50 p.m. Pensacola, Florida: Sunday 12:19 a.m. \nBattering waves will also ride atop the storm surge, capable of additional damage to docks and buildings. \nWinds \nNate's wind field is not expected to be particularly large. Therefore, the greatest chance of hurricane-force winds capable of structural damage, significant tree damage, and multi-day power outages are likely to be near and east its immediate center or eyewall close to the Gulf Coast around landfall. \nDue to the lopsided nature of Nate, the impacts of wind are expected to be considerably lower on the west side of wherever Nate makes landfall. \nHowever, Nate's relatively fast forward speed, may push tropical storm-force winds over a larger area inland, possibly well into parts of Alabama, Mississippi, the Florida panhandle and western Georgia. \nThese winds are capable of at least some power outages, some downed trees, and perhaps some light structural damage \nRainfall Flooding \nA swath of 3 to 6 inches of rain, with locally higher amounts, is expected not just near the landfall area along the Gulf Coast this weekend, but also well inland through Monday into the Tennessee Valley. 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected as far inland as the mid-Atlantic. \nThis may trigger serious inland flash flooding Sunday into Monday in the Appalachians, as happens often with inland tropical cyclones. \nOther parts of the Ohio Valley and Northeast may also see some heavy rain, depending on the path of Nate's inland remnant. \nTornadoes \nIsolated waterspouts and tornadoes will be possible to the east of and to the north of where Nate makes landfall, with the most likely tornado locations being from southeastern Louisiana eastward to the central Florida panhandle and inland to southern Alabama and southern Georiga. Tornadoes could begin as early as Saturday afternoon on the coast. Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, Central America and western Cuba Forecast \nEffects from Nate are beginning to wane across Mexico and Central America. \nBands of locally heavy rain will become more sporadic through the night in the Yucatan Peninsula and extreme western Cuba. \nAreas of locally heavy rain from a larger-scale \"Central American gyre\" (again, more on this feature below) are likely to persist at least into part of the weekend in parts of Central America and far southeast Mexico. \nHere are the latest rainfall forecasts from the National Hurricane Center: Parts of the Yucatan Peninsula: 2 to 4 inches, with isolated totals as high as 6 inches Eastern Belize and the Cayman Islands: 1 to 3 inches \n( MORE: 2017 Already a Top 10 Most Active Hurricane Season ) Recap \nThis latest tropical system originated on the eastern end of a larger feature, called a Central American gyre . \nEnough spin and thunderstorm activity was collected east of Nicaragua on Oct. 4 that the National Hurricane Center upgraded Invest 90L to a tropical depression. Heavy rain partially from the gyre and from newly upgraded Tropical Depression 16 spread across Central America. \nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, Nate was upgraded from a tropical depression on the morning of Oct. 5 based on radar from San Andr\u00e9s, an island east of Nicaragua, indicating a partial eyewall and a surface pressure measurement over Nicaragua found to be lower than previous advisories. Nate moved ashore over northeastern Nicaragua and eastern Honduras later that day. \nOn Oct. 6, Nate accelerated through the northwestern Caribbean and through the Yucatan Channel while organizing and intensifying. A wind gust of 52 mph was reported in Isabel Rubio in western Cuba as Nate shot the goal posts between the Yucatan and Cuba. Hurricane hunters reported a building eyewall in Nate's eastern semicircle. What Spawned This? More on Central American Gyres \nThis \"gyre\" is a large, broad area of low pressure over the Central American isthmus and western Caribbean Sea. This feature can lead to the development of a tropical cyclone in the Caribbean Sea and/or in the eastern Pacific Ocean. \nThese gyres most often form in the late spring and early fall, when cold fronts become uncommon in this region of the world. They're most common in September, but can be a source of tropical storms and hurricanes into November, and as early as May. \nWe typically see up to two gyres like this one set up each year, and they can spawn tropical storms in both the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins, sometimes in each basin at the same time. Not all gyres produce tropical cyclones, but they all produce heavy rainfall. \nRoughly 50 percent of Central American gyres have a tropical cyclone associated with them, according to Philippe Papin , Ph.D. candidate at the University of Albany. \"When a tropical cyclone does occur, it tends to form on the eastern side of the [gyre] and rotates counterclockwise around the larger circulation.\" \nGyre-like tropical systems are much more common in the western Pacific closer to southeast Asia, where the monsoon plays a larger role in the weather. \nA notable example of gyre-induced tropical cyclone formation occurred in 2010 when Tropical Storm Nicole formed just south of Cuba from the gyre in late September. \nNicole was a short-lived and ill-formed tropical storm that tried to cross Cuba. It brought heavy rain to the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, Cuba and portions of South Florida. \nHurricane Stan in 2005 is another good example of a hurricane's interaction with a Central American Gyre, according to Papin. \nFollowing Stan's dissipation over the mountains of central Mexico, its remnant spin became part of a larger gyre that caused heavy rainfall over Central America. While Stan's direct circulation resulted in around 80 deaths, according to the National Hurricane Center , heavy rainfall resulting from the gyre took more than 1,000 lives across Central America. \nOther examples include Tropical Storm Andrea (2013), Hurricane Ida (2009 \u2013 assist from the gyre) and Hurricane Patricia (2015 \u2013 assist from the gyre, not a direct result). \nThe Weather Company\u2019s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

Nate will make a second landfall on the northern Gulf Coast in the next hour or two. Destructive, hurricane-force winds are now moving ashore along the Mississippi coast within Nate's northern eyewall. Life-threatening storm surge is expected along the coast overnight from southeast Louisiana to the western Florida Panhandle. Nate will produce a swath of heavy rain from the Gulf Coast to the Appalachians and possibly parts of the Northeast. Strong winds capable of tree damage and power outages will penetrate inland over the Southeast through Sunday. \nThis is a developing weather story. Please click here for the latest updates on Hurricane Nate. \n\nHurricane Nate's northern eyewall is moving ashore along the Mississippi coast, where a second landfall is expected in the next hour or two. \nNate made its first landfall as a Category 1 hurricane near the mouth of the Mississippi River earlier this evening. \n( COMPLETE NATE COVERAGE: Hurricane Central ) Happening Now \nThe latest data from NOAA and the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft suggest that maximum sustained winds are at 85 mph, which makes Nate a Category 1 hurricane. According to The Weather Channel senior meteorologist Stu Ostro, Nate met the criteria for rapid intensification by Saturday morning. \nNate's center is currently about 35 miles south-southwest of Biloxi, Mississippi, moving rapidly north at 20 mph. \nHurricane-force winds extend up to 35 miles from the center of Nate, while tropical-storm-force winds currently reach up to 125 miles from the center. These winds are mainly occurring east of Nate's center, something commonly seen with hurricanes moving this fast. \nDestructive, hurricane-force winds are now moving ashore along the Mississippi coast within Nate's northern eyewall. \nWater levels have exceeded 4 feet above normal tides at Mobile, Alabama (Coast Guard station). Storm-surge inundation of 4.75 feet above normal tide levels has been observed at Shell Beach, Louisiana. Bay Waveland Yacht Club, Mississippi, has recorded an inundation over 4.1 feet above normal tides. Watches and Warnings \nA hurricane warning is in effect from the mouth of the Pearl River to the Alabama/Florida border. \nA storm surge warning has been posted from the mouth of the Mississippi River to the Okaloosa/Walton county line in Florida. This means a life-threatening inundation is likely in these areas with the landfall of Nate, in this case, tonight into early Sunday. \nTropical storm warnings are in effect for the New Orleans metro area and Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas, from Grand Isle to Morgan City, Louisiana, and east of the Alabama/Florida border to Indian Pass, Florida. \nTropical storm watches extend well inland into north Georgia. U.S. Forecast Timeline \nNate's center will make a second landfall along the northern Gulf Coast, between southeast Louisiana and the far western Florida Panhandle, tonight into early Sunday, likely as a Category 1 hurricane. \nHere's a timeline of events with this system, regarding the U.S. Gulf Coast: Overnight: Damaging, hurricane-force winds in hurricane warning and possibly in watch areas; second landfall expected with storm-surge flooding in surge flood warning and possibly watch areas; bands of heavy rain; worst of the impacts will be to the north and east of the center track. Sunday morning: Again, second landfall will occur before dawn with storm-surge flooding, hurricane- or tropical-storm-force winds near and east of the center; areas of heavy rain spread into other parts of the Southeast, southern Appalachians. Sunday afternoon/night: Nate weakens over the Tennessee Valley with some lingering strong wind gusts, but heavy, potentially flooding rain continues in the Appalachians, Tennessee Valley. Monday: Lingering heavy rain, flash flooding possible in the Appalachians, eastern Ohio Valley and parts of the Northeast. U.S. Impacts \nStorm Surge \nThe peak storm surge will occur with the closest approach of the center of Nate tonight into early Sunday morning. \nHere are the potential peak water levels above ground you may see within the few hours before and after Nate's landfall, according to the National Hurricane Center. This should be thought of as the worst-case flooding expected with Nate, if the storm surge arrives at high tide. \nUnfortunately, there is high tide during the overnight hours tonight as Nate's center draws near. Here are the times of high tide, in local time, for several locations that are expected to see storm-surge flooding from Nate: Grand Isle, Louisiana: Saturday 11:31 p.m. Waveland, Mississippi: Sunday 1:20 a.m. Dauphin Island, Alabama: Saturday 11:50 p.m. Pensacola, Florida: Sunday 12:19 a.m. \nBattering waves will also ride atop the storm surge, capable of additional damage to docks and buildings. \nWinds \nNate's wind field is not particularly large, compared to mammoth-sized recent storms like Sandy or Ike. \nHowever, Nate's Category 1 intensity and, also importantly, its rapid forward speed, will likely push tropical-storm-force and hurricane-force winds somewhat farther inland than a typical landfall. \nTherefore, hurricane-force winds capable of structural damage, significant tree damage and multi-day power outages may penetrate about 100 miles or so inland over parts of eastern Mississippi and southwest Alabama into Sunday, mainly contained in Nate's eyewall. \nDue to the lopsided nature of Nate, the impacts of wind are expected to be considerably lower on the west side of wherever Nate makes landfall. \nTropical-storm-force winds, capable of at least some power outages, some downed trees and perhaps some light structural damage, may penetrate as far north as the Smoky Mountains, and may occur in cities such as Birmingham, Huntsville, Atlanta, Chattanooga and Knoxville Sunday and Sunday night. \nRainfall Flooding \nA swath of 3 to 6 inches of rain, with locally up to 10 inches possible, is expected not just near the landfall area along the Gulf Coast this weekend, but also well inland through Monday into the Tennessee Valley. \nTwo to 5 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 7 inches, are expected as far inland as the mid-Atlantic states and parts of the Ohio Valley. \nThis may trigger serious inland flash flooding Sunday into Monday in the Appalachians, as happens often with inland tropical cyclones. \nTornadoes \nIsolated tornadoes will be possible generally to the east and north of where Nate makes landfall, with the most likely tornado locations being from southeast Louisiana eastward to the central Florida Panhandle and inland to southern Alabama and southern Georgia. \nNOAA's Storm Prediction Center has issued a tornado watch valid until 2 a.m. CDT for southern Alabama, the western Florida Panhandle and southeast Mississippi. Recap \nThis latest tropical system originated on the eastern end of a larger feature, called a Central American gyre . \nEnough spin and thunderstorm activity was collected east of Nicaragua on Oct. 4 that the National Hurricane Center upgraded Invest 90L to a tropical depression.

Before the increase, an investigative reporter called dozens of hospitals and facilities to find out how many died from Hurricane Maria. One of the issues behind the toll not being updated were death certificates that were not being signed. Authorities say the actual number of deaths may far exceed what is being reported. \nAfter nearly a week of not increasing, Puerto Rico's official death toll from Hurricane Maria rose to 36 Tuesday, according to the island's governor. \nAuthorities say the actual number of deaths may far exceed what is being reported. \nWhen the official death toll on the U.S. territory stood at 16, an investigative reporter with the Center for Investigative Journalism (CPI) discovered that as many as 60 people or more may have died from the storm that devasted the island on Sept. 20. \nDoubting the government's reports, investigative reporter Omaya Sosa Pascual with CPI called 69 hospitals and asked about the number of deaths at each facility. Speaking with doctors, administrators, morgue directors and funeral directors, she determined that at least 28 people had died . \nAfter that report, the country's secretary of public security, Hector Pesquera, confirmed to Pascual on Monday that the official death toll reported by the government did not reflect the actual number of dead. \nPesquera told the reporter that one of the problems is unsigned death certificates. Without an individual's death certificate, they cannot be counted on the official death toll. \n\u201cEverything in the government has collapsed,\u201d Pascual told Vox.com by phone . \u201cSome of the people who work in the government lost their homes themselves and aren\u2019t at work. So they can\u2019t do death certificates. The dead can\u2019t be documented because of all the logistics and legal aspects of declaring someone dead.\u201d \n(MORE: Florida Gov. Rick Scott Declares State of Emergency to Help Puerto Rico Recovery Efforts ) \nThe lack of internet services and downed telephone lines make it difficult for remote areas to report deaths. In some cases, family members have buried the dead without a death certificate. \n\u201cWe\u2019re finding dead people, people who have been buried. Related to the hurricane (we have) 19 dead, which the governor reported, but [people] have made common graves. We\u2019ve been told people have buried their family members because they\u2019re in places that have yet to be reached,\u201d Pesquera told CPI. \nPesquera also noted that the names of the dead will not be revealed until relatives can be notified, a difficult task in some cases considering the lack of communication on the island. \nPascual said it's also becoming difficult to decipher whether a person died from natural causes or as a result of the hurricane. \nIn any case, the number of cadavers is mounting as people in critical conditions die because there is no power still and because doctors and nurses are unable to work. \nThis week, the official death toll of 16 prompted President Donald Trump to praise the government's response, which could prove to be a premature assessment. \n\u201cThe loss of life \u2014 it\u2019s always tragic \u2014 but it\u2019s been incredible the results that we\u2019ve had with respect to loss of life,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cPeople can\u2019t believe how successful that has been, relatively speaking.\u201d \nWhile the final death toll may never be fully known, some experts say that it is likely to reach into the hundreds , including John Mutter, a disaster expert at Columbia University. \nCarmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, mayor of Puerto Rico\u2019s capital San Juan, gave an emotional plea on Friday that may also hint that the death toll will turn out to be far greater than what is being reported. \n\u201cI am begging, begging anyone who can hear us to save us from dying,\u201d she said . \u201cIf anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy.\u201d \nThe Weather Company\u2019s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

The last time three hurricanes made landfall in the contiguous U.S. in one year was 2008. Nate will likely make landfall on the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Matthew. \nThe busy 2017 Atlantic hurricane season continues as Hurricane Nate closes in on the U.S. Gulf Coast. \nHere are six things to know about Nate. 1. Hurricane Nate to Make Landfall This Weekend \nHurricane Nate is expected to arrive on the northern U.S. Gulf Coast late Saturday into early Sunday. \nThe computer models are in good agreement on the overall track and Nate is likely to make landfall somewhere from far southeast Louisiana to southern Mississippi and southwest Alabama. \n(LATEST ON NATE: Hurricane Central ) \nA combination of warm sea-surface temperatures and light wind shear could allow for some additional intensification. \nNate is moving quickly with a forward speed greater than 20 mph. The National Weather Service in New Orleans remarked that Nate was moving at cruise ship speed Saturday morning. 2. U.S. Impacts \nHurricane conditions are likely late Saturday into early Sunday from coastal southeastern Louisiana eastward to southern Alabama and a few miles inland, with winds greater than 40 mph occurring well into southern Mississippi, Alabama and western Florida. \nTropical storm and hurricane warnings have been issued for parts of the Gulf Coast and residents along the Gulf Coast from Louisiana through the Florida Panhandle should be finishing preparations. \nStorm surge flooding is a major threat from southeastern Louisiana eastward to Mobile Bay where winds are expected to be onshore as Nate makes landfall. \nIf you live in a storm surge prone location and have been told to evacuate, please follow instructions from local officials. \nIt is likely that heavy rainfall will spread across portions of the South. A widespread area of at least 3 inches of rain is expected with the heaviest rain forecast from southeast Louisiana to southern Alabama and inland as far as the central Appalachians, Tennessee Valley and Ohio Valley, which could lead to flash flooding even well inland. \nA few tornadoes could also occur near and inland from the Gulf Coast. 3. Power Outages Are Expected Across the South \nIn addition to water impacts, wind will likely bring down power lines and trees along its path, especially close to the Gulf of Mexico. \nWinds greater than 40 mph are possible from the point of landfall northward into Mississippi, Alabama and north Georgia, with wind gusts to 60 mph. This is strong enough to do damage to trees and homes. \nPower outages are possible as far north and east as the southern Appalachians. 4. It Has Been Nine Years Since Three Hurricanes Made Landfall in the Contiguous U.S. in One Year \nNate is projected to remain a hurricane as it makes landfall on the northern U.S. Gulf Coast. \nAssuming this occurs, Nate would join Harvey and Irma, which also made landfall as hurricanes this year in the contiguous U.S. Fortunately, Nate is not expected to be a major hurricane, Category 3 or higher , like Harvey and Irma were at the time of landfall. \nThe last time three hurricanes made landfall in the Lower 48 in one year was 2008 . \nIn 2008, Hurricane Dolly made landfall in far southern Texas on South Padre Island on July 23 as a Category 1 hurricane, causing significant wind and flood damage. \nThen on Sept. 1, Hurricane Gustav made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane. More than $4 billion in damages occurred in the U.S. along with more than 10 deaths. \nHurricane Ike was a long-lived Cabo Verde hurricane that made landfall along the upper Texas coast as a strong Category 2 hurricane on Sept. 13. Extensive damage occurred, including significant storm surge and wave damage in upper Texas and southwestern Louisiana. As a direct result of Ike, 21 people died in Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. 5. An October Hurricane Landfall Along the Northern Gulf Coast Is Rare \nHurricane season officially lasts through Nov. 30, but tropical activity decreases moving through October and November. \nWhere tropical cyclones form also changes in October, compared to the peak of the season. Instead of looking toward the central and eastern Atlantic Ocean, tropical storms and hurricanes more commonly develop in the western Caribbean Sea, eastern Gulf of Mexico and far western Atlantic Ocean in October. \nGiven the change in where tropical systems form, where landfall typically happen also shifts. One of the reasons for this is cold fronts begin to push farther south as fall progresses, providing some protection if timed correctly, to areas along the western and northern Gulf Coast. \nSince 1950, only four tropical systems have made landfall along the Texas or Louisiana coast in October. \nMeanwhile, Florida is a more common location for October landfalls. 6. Nate's Landfall Will Coincide With the One-Year Anniversary of Hurricane Matthew's Landfall \nThe current forecast calls for Nate to make landfall along the Gulf Coast either late on Saturday, Oct. 7 or early on Sunday, Oct. 8. \nIf this takes place on Oct. 8, this would be on the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Matthew's landfall in South Carolina. \nMatthew was a destructive storm as it tracked through the Caribbean as a major hurricane. The path of Matthew took its center just off the coasts of Florida and Georgia. \n(MORE: Hurricane Matthew Recap ) \nImpacts from Matthew were felt in the U.S. from Florida to North Carolina, including storm surge damage, strong winds and heavy rain. The heavy rain brought widespread flash flooding and record river flooding to eastern North Carolina. \nNate will not affect the same areas as Matthew and is not expected to be as powerful, but is a good reminder that hurricane season is not over yet. \nThe Weather Company\u2019s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

Major flooding was seen overnight in Biloxi, Mississippi, and Mobile, Alabama. Numerous tornadoes were reported on the east side of the storm. No injuries or deaths have been reported in the U.S. \nTropical Storm Nate continued its onslaught of the Gulf Coast Sunday morning, bringing major storm-surge flooding to Biloxi and Mobile while knocking out power to more than 60,000 homes and businesses across the region. The first hurricane to make landfall in Mississippi since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Nate's powerful surge flooded several of the resorts and casinos along Mississippi's coast. The storm triggered flooding along sections of U.S. 90, according to the Mississippi Department of Transportation. In the hour preceding the storm's second landfall, water levels exceeded 4 feet above normal along the coast of Mobile, Alabama. Toppled trees damaged several homes in the city as winds increased, and a billboard was blown down near the local airport, the National Weather Service reported. (MORE: Get the Latest Forecast for Nate ) Currently, some 10,000 customers in southern Mississippi are without power due to the storm, according to the Mississippi Power Customers online management tool , and more than 55,000 are without power in Alabama early Sunday morning, Alabama Power reported. The storm also led to several reports of tornadoes on the east side of the storm, according to the NWS, and in Alabama, waterspouts were spotted off the coast. One confirmed waterspout moved ashore in Gulf Shores, Alabama, but no damage or injuries were reported. \nPrior to landfall, the storm raced toward the coast at 28 mph \u2013 the fastest recorded forward motion of a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, according to the NWS. \nPensacola International Airport in Florida closed at 6 p.m. local time Saturday and will remain closed through Sunday. Mobile Regional Airport closed at 4 p.m. Saturday but officials hope to reopen Sunday around noon. Mississippi \nAs high tide coincided with some of Nate's worst storm surge early Sunday morning, water was pushed ashore in massive quantities, flooding the parking deck of the Golden Nugget casino as well as parts of U.S. 90 near the coast. \n\"It kind of surprised us,\" Mike Kovacevich, who lives two blocks north of U.S. 90, told Biloxi officials on their Facebook page, as reported by the Associated Press. \"We didn't expect to be this deep. It come in pretty good \u2014 a lot of water.\" \nPresident Trump approved the emergency declaration for Mississippi on Saturday evening shortly as Nate closed in on the state. \nThe city of Biloxi announced a curfew for residents lasting from 7 p.m. Saturday local time until 9 a.m. Sunday. \nState officials said they plan to open 11 shelters for evacuees Saturday and will run buses for residents who are unable to drive. \nMississippi Power said Saturday it secured the assistance of up to 800 crew members , WLOX.com reported, and Singing River Electric crews are ready to restore power, if and when needed. Louisiana \nLocal officials have urged residents to take the storm seriously. Gov. John Bel Edwards urged residents on Thursday to be \"where they need to be by 3 p.m.\" Saturday evening, considering the speed at which the storm moved toward the coast. \n\"This is a dangerous storm,\" Edwards said. \"We have to make sure we are not taking it lightly.\" \nEvacuation orders were expanded Friday in Louisiana. In Jefferson Parish, mandatory evacuations were ordered in Lafitte , according to WWL-TV. Evacuations were also ordered in part of St. Bernard Parish located outside the levee protection system on Thursday, the AP reported. \nOfficials in Grand Isle, a barrier island south of New Orleans, issued a voluntary evacuation for residents. Other voluntary evacuations were issued for parts of Lafourche and St. John parishes, WWL-TV also said. \nA curfew will begin at 10 p.m. Saturday in St. John Parish, ending at 5 a.m. Sunday, local time. \nEvacuations were ordered Friday for the Venetian Isles, Lake Catherine and the Irish Bayou areas outside of the New Orleans' levee protection system, and a mandatory curfew was ordered by New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu beginning at 7 p.m. local time Saturday, ending Sunday at 6 a.m. \nLandrieu said flood-prone underpasses in New Orleans would be blocked to traffic. \nOn Friday, Landrieu said 109 of the city's 120 pumps, or 92 percent, were working, while 26 backup generators were in place and ready to go. \"Since early August, we have made substantial progress,\" New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu told reporters Thursday. \"Right now this storm should not bring us anything that we're not prepared to handle,\" Landrieu said Saturday. Alabama \nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey also declared a state of emergency Thursday in order to free up personnel and resources in case responders need to be dispatched for any storm-related activity, the AP reported. \nThe city of Gulf Shores issued evacuation orders Saturday for areas of West Beach Boulevard. \nShelters were opened ahead of the storm to provide refuge to evacuees or those with nowhere else to go. The Rachel Patterson Elementary School opened its doors Saturday in Atmore, and the Robertsdale Coliseum opened in Baldwin County.

Cold fronts often push tropical systems toward Florida and away from Texas and Louisiana in October and November. Overall tropical activity dwindles through the end of the year. \nThree tropical storms and two hurricanes occur every year, on average, in the entire Atlantic Basin in the final third of hurricane season, according to the National Hurricane Center, but the focus for landfalls begins to shift eastward as seasons change. Hurricanes along the western and northern Gulf Coast become rare as daylight fades and trees begin to change colors. \nOnly 15 named storms or hurricanes have had direct impacts on the Gulf Coast or Florida in October since 1950, and numbers steeply drop to two such systems in November. This averages out to be roughly one named storm landfall from Texas to Florida every four or five years. \nOf those, just four tropical systems have made landfall along the Texas or Louisiana coast, two of which made landfall in the first week of October. \n(MORE: Hurricane Central | Latest on the Tropics ) \nBy October, the formation zones of tropical storms and hurricanes typically shift west toward the western Caribbean Sea, eastern Gulf of Mexico and far western Atlantic Ocean as the \"Cabo Verde\" portion of the hurricane season, featuring development of African easterly waves in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, fades. \n(MORE: How a Borderline La Ni\u00f1a Could Impact the Rest of the Atlantic Hurricane Season ) \nAutumn cold fronts are a saving grace for much of the western and northern Gulf Coast during October and more into November. Cold fronts routinely sweep developing tropical storms and hurricanes out of the Gulf, pushing them northeastward and out to sea. \nThe cold fronts have to be well timed, however. The western Gulf can still be struck by hurricanes that come in between cold fronts. The frequency of cold frontal passage (also known as fropa) increases from October into November. \nOf course, when one location has a better fortune, somewhere else has to pay for it. \nMany Floridians consider October to be the peak of the hurricane season due to the increased number of hurricane strikes in that month, even though the peak of the season for the entire basin occurs in September. \n(MORE: Where the October Hurricane Threat is the Greatest ) \nFrom 1851 to 2016, 32 hurricanes made a Florida landfall in October, dwarfing the state with the second-highest number of October landfalls : Louisiana, with nine. \nBy November, waters are cooling off and the atmosphere is becoming more hostile to tropical weather systems. Dying cold fronts often provide enough spin and moisture to kick-start late-season tropical storms. The most favorable conditions are found in the western Caribbean Sea and southwestern Atlantic, which is often where cold fronts lose their strength. \nAccording to NOAA's best track database, there have been 36 Atlantic tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm strength in November from 1950 through 2015. Twenty of those became hurricanes. \nIn the period of record from 1851 to 2014, no tropical storm or hurricane has impacted the western Gulf Coast from Texas to Mississippi in the month of November. \nSince 1851, Florida has been impacted by eight tropical storms and hurricanes in November. The only other states with more than one November impact were also in the Southeast: Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina. \nTypically, November tropical systems follow the upper-level flow and cold fronts northeastward into the Atlantic Ocean. \nThe Weather Company\u2019s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

Snow has already prompted an interstate closure in southeast Wyoming. Scattered power outages, broken tree limbs and poor travel conditions are potential impacts. \nWinter Storm Aiden is bringing the first snow of the season to the Denver metro area, but its heavy, wet snow to parts of Wyoming, Colorado and western Nebraska may trigger scattered power outages, not to mention travel headaches in the region. \nPrecipitation changed over to snow just after midnight Monday morning in the city of Denver. Already, 2 inches of wet snow accumulation was measured at the National Weather Service office in Boulder, Colorado, early Monday, as well as near the suburb of Arvada on the northwest side of the Denver metro. \nFive inches of snow had accumulated in about nine hours through early Monday morning in Genessee, Colorado, in the Jefferson County foothills. \nIn Wyoming, a stretch of Interstate 80 from east of Rawlins to Cheyenne was shut down early Monday morning due to dangerous winter driving conditions, according to the Wyoming Department of Transportation . \n( IMPACTS: Interstate Shut Down in Wyoming From Aiden Snow ) \nUp to 4 inches of snow had already accumulated in Wheatland, Wyoming, and 5.2 inches of wet snow was measured at the National Weather Service office in Cheyenne, Wyoming. \nElsewhere in Wyoming, 6 inches of snow was measured on Casper Mountain, 8 inches of snow was estimated in Park County, and up to 5 inches was estimated in Yellowstone National Park, according to the NWS-Riverton, Wyoming, office. \nSome light accumulations prompted the closure of the Needles Highway in South Dakota's Custer State Park for a time Sunday. \nThis is the first named winter storm of the season, although parts of the Rockies have seen multiple rounds of snow since September, including a blizzard last week in Montana . \n(MORE: How Winter Storms Are Named ) \nAiden will be a quick-hitting winter storm, partially spawned by a southward dip in the jet stream sweeping into the Rockies. The cold air supplied by that jet stream dip, combined with an upslope northeast surface wind flow, is producing the snow along the Interstate 25 corridor, including in Denver and Cheyenne, Wyoming, as well as parts of the High Plains of western Nebraska and eastern Colorado. \n(MORE: 2017-18 Winter Storm Names ) Forecast Timing and Impacts \nThe National Weather Service has issued winter storm warnings from southeastern Wyoming into Colorado. Winter weather advisories are also posted in other parts of Wyoming and Colorado, along with a small part of the Nebraska Panhandle. \nTiming Monday Morning/Afternoon: Snow, possibly heavy, continues to affect Colorado, along with far northern New Mexico and far southeastern Wyoming. Gusty winds continue on the plains. Monday Night: The winter storm will wind down, but some patches of light snow may linger in southeastern Colorado and northeastern New Mexico. \nForecast Snow Amounts and Impacts Up to 6 inches of total snow is possible along the Interstate 25 corridor, including in Denver and Cheyenne, Wyoming. Heavier amounts are expected in the foothills west of Denver and in the Palmer Divide, along with the Snowy Range in Wyoming. Up to a foot of total snow (locally more) will be possible in those areas. Given trees in lower elevations still have their leaves, the wet snow, in combination with gusty winds, could result in scattered power outages and some broken tree limbs. For Denver, the National Weather Service said bridges and overpasses along the Interstate 25 corridor will be most prone to slushy accumulations. \nThis will be Denver's earliest first snow of the season since 2012. Last year's first measurable snowfall in the Mile High City didn't occur until Nov. 17. The long-term average first measurable snow of the season in Denver is Oct. 18. \nThe good news: this blast of wintry weather will not hang around for long. High temperatures will warm back into the 60s and possibly lower 70s by mid- to late week in Denver. \nThe Weather Company\u2019s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

This is the first time as many as four hurricanes have made a U.S. landfall since 2005. \nHurricane Nate was the fourth hurricane to landfall in the United States in 2017, the first time that's happened in a single hurricane season in over a decade. \n(FULL COVERAGE: Hurricane Central ) \nNate made landfall around 7 p.m. CDT Oct. 7 near the mouth of the Mississippi River as a Category 1 hurricane, then made its final landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi, just after midnight Oct. 8. \nTogether with a trio of Category 4 hurricane landfalls in less than a month's time from late August through late September, this is now the first time since the record-smashing 2005 hurricane season there has been as many as four U.S. landfalls in one season, all occurring within 45 days from Aug. 25 through Oct. 8. \nThat 2005 season featured five U.S. landfalling hurricanes: Cindy, Dennis, Katrina, Rita and Wilma. \n( MORE: Ten Most Extreme Atlantic Hurricane Seasons in the Satellite Era ) \nThe previous season, 2004, also featured five U.S. landfalls, including the infamous Florida four of Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. \nAccording to NOAA's Hurricane Research Division , only 14 other years featured at least four U.S. hurricane landfalls in the same season: \n( Note: A correction was made to the statistics below to include landfalls in Hawaii since 1900, in Puerto Rico since 1898 and in the U.S. Virgin Islands since 1917, when each first became U.S. territories.) 6 landfalls: 1985, 1916, 1886 5 landfalls: 2005, 2004, 1933, 1893 4 landfalls: 1964, 1959, 1909, 1906, 1888, 1869, 1852 \nAs you can see above, 2017 was only the third season in the last 50-plus years to have this happen. The Three Category 4 U.S. Landfalls of 2017 \nHurricane Maria made landfall with winds of 155 mph on September 20 in Puerto Rico. \nIn the weeks before Maria, hurricanes Harvey and Irma made landfall at Category 4 intensity with 130 mph winds on August 25 in Rockport, Texas, and September 10 in the Florida Keys, respectively. \nWinds for a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale range from 130 mph to 156 mph. Winds of that strength are capable of causing catastrophic damage. The scale does not factor other major hazards from hurricanes such as storm surge and flooding rainfall. \nThe landfall of Harvey and Irma at Category 4 strength was already a historic event, marking the first time two Atlantic hurricanes struck the U.S. in the same year . With Puerto Rico taking a direct hit from Maria, the U.S. has now endured landfalls from three Category 4 hurricanes. \nCategory 4 or stronger Atlantic hurricane landfalls in the Lower 48 are a rare occurrence, with only 27 documented since 1851 , including Harvey and Irma. Three of those 27 landfalls were Category 5 hurricanes.

This ties the record for the most consecutive Atlantic named storms to reach hurricane strength. Ophelia is expected to brush by the Azores this weekend. Ophelia will then become a post-tropical cyclone early next week and could bring high winds to parts of Ireland and the U.K. \nHurricane Ophelia remains a Category 2 hurricane and is no threat to the United States, but is expected to brush parts of the Azores this weekend. Ophelia will then bring a blast of strong winds early next week to Ireland and perhaps the United Kingdom as a powerful post-tropical low-pressure system. \n(MORE: Hurricane Central ) \nHurricane Ophelia's forward speed has begun to increase, and it will continue to accelerate toward the east-northeast near or just southeast of the Azores this weekend. \nDepending on its exact track, tropical-storm-force winds are possible in the Azores by late Saturday or Saturday night. At a minimum, some outer rain bands and gusty winds could impact southeastern portions of the Portuguese archipelago this weekend. \nOphelia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 2 to 4 inches over the southeastern Azores through Saturday night, which could lead to flooding. \nAt the same time, a cold front and moisture associated with Ophelia is expected to produce 1 to 3 inches of rainfall over the other islands of the Azores. \n(MORE: 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season Now 8th Most Active in History ) \nOnly 15 hurricanes have passed within 200 nautical miles of the Azores since 1851, according to NOAA's historical hurricane database . All of those occurred in August or September, except for Hurricane Fran in October 1973 and Hurricane Alex in January 2016 , which made landfall shortly after weakening to a tropical storm. \nThe National Hurricane Center forecasts Ophelia to transition into a post-tropical cyclone by Monday \u2013 but with winds remaining at or above hurricane force \u2013 as it curls northeast well off the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain). \n(MORE: Where the October Hurricane Threat is the Greatest ) \nThe post-tropical cyclone is then expected to pass near Ireland on Monday. \nOphelia is expected to weaken some while it tracks near Ireland, but strong winds are becoming increasingly likely over portions of Ireland and the United Kingdom. \nThis could bring a blast of high winds to the Emerald Isle beginning Monday. Portions of the United Kingdom could also be impacted by Ophelia's strong winds. \nDetails on the severity of impacts in Ireland and the U.K. will depend on the exact track of the powerful low-pressure system in relation to those countries. \nMet Eireann has issued a yellow weather advisory for Ireland on Monday, as it notes that the remnants of Hurricane Ophelia have the potential to be a high-impact event in parts of the country. \nThe U.K. Met Office has issued a yellow warning for wind on Monday for portions of northern Ireland, western Scotland, Wales and far western England. The warning indicates that some transportation delays are possible, and there is a slight chance of power outages, damage to buildings and large waves. \nCheck back with weather.com for additional details on forecast impacts in Ireland and the U.K. Record-Tying 10th Consecutive Atlantic Hurricane \nOphelia is the 10th consecutive Atlantic named storm to become a hurricane in 2017. \nThis ties the record for the most consecutive Atlantic named storms reaching hurricane strength, which also happened in three other years : 1878, 1886 and 1893, according to Dr. Phil Klotzbach , Colorado State University tropical meteorologist. \nThere are a couple of caveats to this record, however. \n\"Lee could easily be counted as two storms,\" tweeted Brenden Moses , a University of Miami hurricane researcher specializing in the historical hurricane database. \nAfter briefly becoming a tropical storm, Lee degenerated into a remnant low on Sept. 18 about halfway between west Africa and the Lesser Antilles. Four days later, Lee sprung back to life as a tropical cyclone and eventually strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane on Sept. 27. \nMoses later tweeted that if separated, there would be a tropical storm, then a separate hurricane, which would make the 10-straight-hurricane record invalid. This type of post-analysis occurs after every hurricane season, sometimes leading to the addition of previously unnamed storms or tweaking of tropical cyclone intensities. \nThe other disclaimer about tropical cyclones before satellites were routinely used to examine the entire tropical Atlantic Basin in 1966 is that some tropical storms \u2013 even hurricanes \u2013 may have been missed that could have influenced any streaks, especially in the 19th century. \nThe Weather Company\u2019s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

Historical weather data in tandem with criteria from a winter severity index reveals when winter weather conditions typically arrive where you live. \nWinter officially begins on Dec. 21 this year, but depending on where you live, true winter weather conditions can begin well before this date or even after it passes. \nClimatologist Dr. Brian Brettschneider of the University of Alaska-Fairbanks compiled the map below which captures the median date for when the first winter weather conditions of the season have historically arrived in the United States and Canada. \nBrettschneider used an index called the Accumulated Winter Season Severity Index (AWSSI) to create the map using weather data over the past 40 years. \nFor any given location, the start date of the winter, based on the AWSSI, is defined as when the first measurable snowfall (0.1 inches or greater) occurs, or when the first high temperature 32 degrees or lower is recorded. The start date is Dec. 1 for any location that does not see either prior to that date. \nAs you would expect, the median date when northern climates historically see their first measurable snow or high temperature 32 degrees or lower is before winter officially begins. \nFor parts of northern Canada and Alaska, the median date is long before the official start of winter, occurring in September or even earlier. \nFarther south, the median date for the arrival of the first winter weather conditions of the season is before Dec. 1 in a swath from the Northeast westward through the Midwest and into parts of the Rockies and Northwest. \nWinter starts Dec. 1 in much of the South, based on the AWSSI index criteria, since the median date of the first measurable snow or first high temperature 32 degrees or lower is after that date. In some years, parts of the South never see measurable snow or a high temperature 32 degrees or lower. \n(MORE: When the First Snow of the Season Typically Occurs ) \nDuring the course of the winter season, the AWSSI tracks the severity of winter weather conditions in real-time for several cities across the U.S. \n\"The categories are site-specific ... because what constitutes a severe winter, say, in Washington D.C. or Atlanta would be considered mild in Chicago or Minneapolis ,\" said Dr. Barbara Mayes Boustead, co-creator of AWSSI and a forecaster at the National Weather Service in Omaha, Nebraska. \nThe index takes into account the \"intensity and persistence of cold weather, the frequency and amount of snow and the amount and persistence of snow on the ground ,\" said the Midwest Regional Climate Center. Wind and mixed precipitation, such as freezing rain, are not a part of the index. \nThe index uses five categories \u2013 mild, moderate and average to severe and extreme \u2013 to rate the severity of winter weather at any given point in the season. \nYou can track the AWSSI during the winter ahead at this link . \nThe Weather Company\u2019s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

Fine grains from the parched ground have helped form the sepia tinge to the air. \nForecaster Dave Reynolds, of The Weather Channel, said: \u201cWinds were strong over Iberia on Sunday, which has resulted in dust blown to the UK on a strong south to south-westerly flow. \n\u201cThis is a result of Ophelia positioned to the west of Portugal on Sunday and high pressure over the western Mediterranean. \n\u201cFurthermore, and importantly, the cold front of Ophelia moved across southern Britain this morning and was very weak - this meant there was not much rain to wash the dust out. \n\u201cUsually winds would veer away and fresher, clearer Atlantic air would come in behind a cold front - but this won\u2019t happen until later today. As fresher air moves in, expect the colouration to gradually fade. \n\u201cMuch of the cloud at the moment is also at mid-levels. Lower and upper levels are fairly clear, which allows more sunlight to penetrate and, combined with the fairly high cloud base - 3,600 ft at Birmingham Airport - allows conditions to be bright at surface. \n\u201cIt\u2019s worth checking car bonnets and car roofs for any dust - it\u2019s most noticeable if there\u2019s a little light rain.

One person was killed Monday morning after a tree fell on a car in County Waterford, according to RTE. \nIn addition to downed trees in Ireland, some roofs have been damaged or blown off . \nThe Irish Times said at least 360,000 ESB Networks customers lost power in Ireland because of the storm. \nIrish authorities have ordered all schools in Ireland to be closed again on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported. \nOphelia is striking Ireland and the United Kingdom as a post-tropical cyclone after the former hurricane lost its tropical characteristics in the northeast Atlantic Ocean on Sunday. \nMet Eireann has issued a red wind warning for all of Ireland on Monday. This is where sustained winds over 50 mph and gusts over 80 mph are expected, potentially causing structural damage and dangerous marine conditions. Downed trees and power lines are also likely. \n\"There is potential risk to lives,\" Met Eireann noted in the warning. \nThe U.K. Met Office has issued an amber warning for wind on Monday in Northern Ireland. The warning indicates that some transportation delays are possible, and there is a chance of power outages. \nA yellow warning for wind is in place across western Scotland, Wales and far western England. \nIn the United Kingdom, Saharan dust and wildfire smoke that was drawn northward by Ophelia resulted in a brilliant sunrise on Monday morning. Recap: Farthest East Major Hurricane on Record \nFor a time Saturday into early Sunday, Ophelia was a major hurricane ( Category 3 or stronger on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale ). \nThat made Ophelia the farthest east Category 3 hurricane on record for the Atlantic Basin. The previous record was Hurricane Frances in 1980. \nOphelia was also the sixth major hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season. This means 2017 is tied for the most major hurricanes through Oct. 14 with 1933, 1961, 1964 and 2004, according to Dr. Phil Klotzbach , Colorado State University tropical meteorologist. \nOphelia was also the 10th consecutive Atlantic named storm to become a hurricane in 2017. \nThis ties the record for the most consecutive Atlantic named storms reaching hurricane strength, which also happened in three other years : 1878, 1886 and 1893, according to Dr. Phil Klotzbach . \nThere are a couple of caveats to this record, however. \n\"Lee could easily be counted as two storms,\" tweeted Brenden Moses , a University of Miami hurricane researcher specializing in the historical hurricane database. \nAfter briefly becoming a tropical storm, Lee degenerated into a remnant low on Sept. 18 about halfway between West Africa and the Lesser Antilles. Four days later, Lee sprung back to life as a tropical cyclone and eventually strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane on Sept. 27. \nMoses later tweeted that if separated, there would be a tropical storm, then a separate hurricane, which would make the 10-straight-hurricane record invalid. This type of post-analysis occurs after every hurricane season, sometimes leading to the addition of previously unnamed storms or tweaking of tropical cyclone intensities. \nThe other disclaimer about tropical cyclones before satellites were routinely used to examine the entire tropical Atlantic Basin in 1966 is that some tropical storms \u2013 even hurricanes \u2013 may have been missed that could have influenced any streaks, especially in the 19th century. \nThe Weather Company\u2019s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

Overall, progress has been slow and uneven, stoking concerns about whether the unproven company is up to the task \u2013 and raising questions about the irregular way in which the territorial government awarded the contract. Ordinarily, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides money and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers oversees federally led recovery efforts after a disaster. Neither agency said it had a role in awarding or supervising the contract Puerto Rico awarded to restore its power lines. Concerns eased Monday after FEMA and the Army Corps belatedly announced a $240 million contract with Irving, Texas-based Fluor Corporation to take the lead in restoring transmission and distribution lines. But head-scratching continues over the curious and opaque manner in which heavily indebted Puerto Rico eclipsed FEMA, the Army Corps and a national network of public utilities \u2013 brimming with line workers and bucket trucks \u2013 by turning over such an immense responsibility to a two-year-old private company with few resources of its own. Typically, immediately after a disaster, the American Public Power Association \u2013 a public utilities trade group \u2013 emcees a conference call with its membership \u2013 1,100 public utilities across the country \u2013 to get all the needed line workers and bucket trucks to the stricken area as soon as possible under what are called mutual aid agreements. For instance, the public power association facilitated the rapid deployment of many thousands of workers and their equipment to Texas and Florida after hurricanes Harvey and Irma struck. But the Puerto Rico Electrical Power Authority (PREPA) took a different route after Maria\u2019s 155 mph winds decimated the island\u2019s already-failing electrical grid on Sept. 20, leaving 3.4 million residents, hospitals and businesses without electricity \u2013 possibly for months. When the power association convened its conference shortly after Maria struck, PREPA told participants it wouldn\u2019t need the network\u2019s help because it had already contracted with Whitefish Energy Holdings LLC, a two-year-old consultancy, to spearhead the restoration efforts. Whitefish, having to subcontract almost all of the work, had recruited and deployed 160 of the 1,000 workers needed to do the job \u2013 16 percent \u2013 three weeks after Maria struck. By then, coincidentally, 16 percent of the power grid has been restored. Last week, the effort saw reversals when a large number of people whose power had been restored lost it again when a transmission line tripped. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit unclear why PREPA chose to go down that route, especially considering the offer was made to them for this mutual aid from the American Public Power Association that apparently wasn\u2019t taken advantage of,\u201d said Cathy Kunkel, an energy analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a non-profit that focuses on utility issues. It might have been \u201creasonable\u201d to try to act quickly given the devastation caused by Maria, she said. However, she urged a federally appointed board overseeing Puerto Rico\u2019s finances to obtain \u201ca copy of that contract and do oversight on how that money was spent\u201d to ensure that local ratepayers and U.S. taxpayers aren\u2019t getting \u201cripped off.\u201d The slow progress and questions surrounding the contract led the public power association to confirm Monday that Puerto Rico bypassed its vast resources by awarding the contract to Whitefish. \u201cTo date, PREPA has not requested aid from the Association; rather, it has engaged Whitefish to marshal the resources required to undertake power restoration,\u201d the power authority stated. \u201cCommunications with PREPA and Whitefish have been difficult due to the telecommunications issues on the island.\u201d The contract was reportedly awarded through a phone call placed in the days immediately after Maria hit. A PREPA employee who happened to have a satellite phone and phone number for Whitefish made the call, according a story published by E&E News , an independent news organization that focuses on energy and environmental issues. The employee had the phone number for Whitefish because PREPA had issued a request for proposals several days earlier to handle far-less-extensive damage caused by Hurricane Irma. It had grazed Puerto Rico two weeks earlier. Whitefish was one of only two companies to respond to the request, and so its phone number was handy after the power grid went dark because of Maria. But the timing left PREPA almost no time to vet the company. The E&E article was based on an interview with Ricardo Ramos, PREPA\u2019s CEO, who told the publication, \u201cThe day that the Corps of Engineers showed up and offered the assistance, we immediately accepted because we knew that financially it was a better model. The benefit is that I don\u2019t have to spend the remaining dollars that are needed for recuperating the system.\u201d The Army Corps denied any role whatsoever in the awarding or execution of the Whitefish contract. Andrew Techmanski, who founded Whitefish in May 2015, told Bloomberg News in Puerto Rico that while other power companies were \u201cafraid of the question of how are we going to get paid, Whitefish Energy was the company that actually made the leap of faith and was able to get over here.\" But PREPA spokesman Carlos Monroig Aceveda told weather.com that it had paid Whitefish \u201c$2 million for the costs of mobilizing personnel and equipment,\u201d adding that its contracts \u201care evaluated and awarded by the U.S. Corps of Engineers in coordination with FEMA, which disburses the money.\u201d His statement that the Corps was supervising didn\u2019t square with what Catalina Carrasco of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers told weather.com. She said the Corps \u201cdoes not have any involvement with the contract between PREPA and Whitefish, adding in an email that the Corps \u201cdoes not know how PREPA negotiated the contract. USACE does not know how PREPA is paying Whitefish. The contract is between PREPA and Whitefish. Corps of Engineers, did not negotiate, does not have ANY involvement between PREPA and Whitefish.\u201d The emphasis was in the email. William Douglass, a spokesperson for FEMA, said the agency\u2019s databases do not show any dealings with Whitefish, although he added that FEMA gives money to agencies like PREPA and those agencies sometimes give some money to a third party like Whitefish without FEMA necessarily knowing. Both FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers have distanced themselves from PREPA\u2019s contract with Whitefish. But FEMA has given PREPA $97 million to restore the power lines and PREPA could have used some of that money to pay Whitefish. FEMA announced Monday it was approving an additional $128 million for PREPA. PREPA itself is bankrupt, $9 billion in debt and currently generating no revenue. Even before hurricanes Irma and Maria struck, the island was experiencing frequent blackouts because of its aging power infrastructure. PREPA has existed for decades on financial vapors, resulting in critical maintenance being deferred and significant deterioration of its power generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure. Whitefish\u2019s Techmanski was working in Puerto Rico and couldn\u2019t be reached for comment, according to spokesman Brandon Smulyan, who was himself unable to answer basic questions about the company because he has only been working with Whitefish under a contract for the past week. For instance, he couldn\u2019t say how many employees Whitefish has. Public records list Andrew Techmanski as the president and Amanda Techmanski, whom public records identify as a registered nurse, as the manager. Andrew Techmanski has an extensive background in power-line work, according to his LinkedIn profile and other public records. Smulyan said the young company is funded by two private equity firms \u2013 HBC Investments and Flat Creek Capital \u2013 both based in Dallas, Texas \u2013 and Brazil-based Comtrafo Transformers, which builds power transformers. \u201cTo date,\u201d Smulyan wrote in an Oct. 11 email, \u201cWhitefish has visited, assessed and created operational bases in Cayey, Arecibo, Salinas, Manati, and Ponce and San Juan. Whitefish has repaired structures, conductors and lines in Salinas and has built access roads to the southern portion of the Salinas 230kv line.\u201d It also has contracted with JEA, a public utility serving the Jacksonville, Florida, area to send 41 line workers and service personnel to Puerto Rico. New York has sent a contingent of line workers, as well. Separately, the Army Corps of Engineers has put in a purchase order for 50,000 utility poles and 6,500 miles of cable. It also awarded a $35.1 million contract to West Chester, Pennsylvania-based Weston Solutions to install a 50 megawatt generator in Puerto Rico\u2019s Palo Seco Power Plant. FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Department of Energy all have personnel on the ground coordinating power restoration efforts. Puerto Rico\u2019s power infrastructure has been a concern for decades partly because it lies in the heart of a hurricane corridor. Previously, the territory\u2019s power grid was ripped up by Hurricane Georges in 1998. After Georges, the Clinton administration gave $133 million to PREPA to fix the power grid and begin putting lines underground. In 2000, the administration issued a glowing report saying the improvements had \u201cempowered\u201d Puerto Ricans to \u201cwithstand even the most unreliable weather.\u201d When Hurricane Jos\u00e9 struck Puerto Rico in 1999, the report said, the improvements left people, including PREPA officials, \"confident\" the island would not lose power. And it didn\u2019t. But 18 years later, Maria utterly destroyed the grid and it remains unclear when \u2013 and for how long \u2013 power will be restored.

This system could also bring light amounts of rain to fire-ravaged northern California Thursday night. \nA more classic atmospheric river event is expected in the Northwest Saturday and Sunday. You can see each of these storms clearly on a Pacific-wide satellite image. \nAn atmospheric river is a thin and long plume of moisture that stretches from the tropics or subtropics into higher latitudes \u2013 in this weekend's case, from the western Pacific Ocean to the northwestern United States. Current Satellite, Pressure and Atmospheric Moisture (The light blue lines are isobars, or lines of equal pressure. The more numerous and tightly packed the isobars, the stronger the winds. Deeper atmospheric moisture is shown by yellow, orange and red contours.) At a Glance The jet stream will steer a storm tapping an atmospheric river into the Northwest this weekend. Heavy rain and mountain snow will accompany this system. Flooding could become an issue in parts of Washington and Oregon by the weekend. \nHeavy rain accumulations are expected in the Pacific Northwest through this weekend, particularly on windward slopes of the Olympics and Cascades below snow-level and coastal ranges. Some minor river flooding could develop in the most flood-prone rivers in western Washington and Oregon by this weekend. \nRainfall totals in these areas may approach 12 inches through Sunday when factoring in the rain that has already fallen plus what is to come. Rain and Snow Forecast \nAlong the Interstate 5 corridor, more than 3 inches of rain could fall through Sunday, including the Seattle and Portland metro areas. \nIn the highest elevations of the Cascades, heavy precipitation will fall in the form of snow, resulting in snowfall totals of a foot or more, particularly in Washington's North Cascades. Snow levels in these mountains may fall as low as 3,500 feet by Friday, but will then rise ahead of the next storm this weekend. \nThe U.S. National Weather Service office in Seattle recommended clearing any leaves that may be clogging your storm drain. \nA break from this barrage of stormy weather will arrive in the Northwest early next week as the jet stream lifts northward and forces the storm track into Canada.

The U.S. Virgin Islands, including the islands of Saint Croix, Saint John, and Saint Thomas, gained citizenship on Feb. 25, 1927. Residents of these territories can freely travel to the United States. \nThe post-hurricane recovery that faces Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands has brought attention to the status of the U.S. territories. According to a September poll, only 54 percent of Americans knew that people born in Puerto Rico were U.S. citizens and were not citizens of their own country. As a humanitarian crisis continues to unfold for the islands, here's a look at some frequently asked questions about Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. What about Citizenship? \nPuerto Ricans were officially recognized as citizens of the United States on March 2, 1917, when President Woodrow Wilson signed the Jones-Shafroth Act. The population of Puerto Rico is 3.4M. \nResidents of the U.S. Virgin Islands have been citizens since Feb. 25, 1927, when Congress voted to bestow U.S. citizenship on them. A little over 100,000 people live on the islands. \nPuerto Ricans are also eligible for the military draft, and thousands served in both World Wars. \nThe specific rights bestowed upon island territories is murkier. \nAccording to Slate's Doug Mack, a 1922 U.S. Supreme Court case, Balzac v. Porto Rico, found that the U.S. Constitution didn\u2019t apply in totality to the territories : \"only 'fundamental' rights were automatically in effect.\" Mack also found that the \"Sixth Amendment right to a criminal trial by jury has not been held applicable in local courts in Puerto Rico.\" When did the territories become part of the United States? \nFollowing the Spanish-American War in 1898, Puerto Rico officially became a U.S. territory . Up until that time, Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony. \nSpanning from 1754 to 1917, the islands of St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix were Danish colonies. The U.S. officially purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917 for $25 million. Why aren't they states? \nPuerto Rico has generally voted against statehood in referendums that have been taken over the years. But most recently, in June, they voted in favor of statehood, with 97 percent supporting. However, the vote was criticized for its low turnout, with fewer than a quarter of eligible voters participating. To make their vote for statehood binding would take an act of Congress. According to a recent report by Reuters, it is unlikely that the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Senate would affirm their statehood vote because the territory leans Democratic. The USVI held a referendum on political status back in 1993, with the majority voting to remain a territory. \"However, issues of voter eligibility and an excessive number of options contributed to an insufficient percentage of the electorate participating in the vote,\" according to the Pacific Island Times . Can residents vote? \nWhile both Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands residents are ineligible to vote for the President of the United States, they do participate in presidential primaries and play a role in selecting the nominee of both major political parties. Similar to U.S. states, both islands elect local government officials and governors. Do they have Congressional representation? \nPuerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands both have a non-voting delegate in the House of Representatives. This delegate has many of the same responsibilities bestowed upon voting representatives \u2013 they're able to sit on committees and debate legislation. They are currently represented by Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n (R) and USVI Delegate Stacey Plaskett (D). Do residents pay taxes? \nThe majority of Puerto Ricans don't pay federal income taxes but they do pay other federal taxes, including Social Security and Medicare , according to the New York Times. They also pay import, export and commodity taxes. \nThe Weather Company\u2019s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.

Access to clean water, electricity and medicine remains difficult. \nOne month after Hurricane Maria Puerto Rico still finds itself in the middle of a public health crisis. Nearly 30 percent of citizens don\u2019t have access to clean drinking water, 80 percent of the island is without power and dozens of hospitals are without electricity, according to the Government of Puerto Rico. \n\u201cOne of the biggest concerns is that people forget,\u201d Dabney Evans, director of the center for humanitarian emergencies at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, told weather.com. \u201c[For example,] we\u2019re not talking so much about Houston. Attention dwindles away so quickly.\u201d \nAttention may dwindle quickly, but the health crisis facing Puerto Rico likely won\u2019t. Access to Clean Water \nLast week, a leptospirosis outbreak infected at least 10 people. The bacterial disease spreads to humans through drinking water that has been contaminated by animal urine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n\u201cWithout proper sanitation, which requires power for pumps and intact pipes, remaining surface water supplies can be contaminated with fecal material and animal urine (as surmised from current reports of leptospirosis infection in humans),\u201d Barry J. Burton, D.O., visiting assistant professor, Disaster Medicine and Management, Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, told weather.com. \nThat outbreak magnifies the biggest issue facing Puerto Rico right now: A lack of access to reliable, clean water. \n\u201cAn average weight, healthy human requires 90 to 120 ounces of water daily,\u201d said Dr. Burton. \u201cThere is a lack of clean water from both packaged and native (streams and surface) water sources, because many native sources have been contaminated.\u201d \nIn addition to waterborne diseases like leptospirosis, lack of clean water can lead to dehydration, poor hygiene and unsterilized hospitals. \nDespite recent rumors, there has not been an outbreak of the foodborne illness cholera, and the CDC does not anticipate one, either. \n\u201cHospitals that are performing surgeries need clean water for three reasons: Drinking water, hand washing and surgical use,\u201d Evans said. Overwhelmed and understaffed hospitals on the island continue to treat patients, but their jobs are even more difficult without clean water. \nThe issue is compounded by another crisis: A lack of electricity throughout the territory. Access to Electricity \nLack of electricity is a primary concern right now, explained Dr. Evans. \u201cIt means that [Puerto Ricans] will have a lot of difficulty keeping their food safe.\u201d \nNo electricity means no refrigeration, and that can lead to eating unsafe and contaminated foods. \n\u201cEven if you use a generator, you may have difficulty keeping your food clean, which could lead to problems like foodborne illnesses,\u201d said Evans. \nThese illnesses can spread if residents ingest unsafe products. The CDC recommends people throw away food if it has an unusual odor, color or texture, has touched flood water or has not been properly refrigerated due to power outages \u2014 problems that are difficult to avoid in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Access to Medicine \nPower outages also provide a problem for any Puerto Ricans living with chronic conditions, and need electricity to keep their medications refrigerated, said Dr. Evans. \u201cFor example, a diabetic who takes insulin would need to keep their medication refrigerated.\u201d \nThe trouble extends beyond residential homes. It has impacted treatment centers, like dialysis centers, as well. \n\u201c[Dialysis] is really important; it\u2019s vital for the patient to continue living,\u201d said Dr. Carlos Rivera, medical director of the Renal Center of San Sebastian, in a press release. \u201cIf the patient in end stage renal disease does not receive dialysis they could die in a couple of weeks.\u201d \n\u201cThe DHHS and FEMA have been working hand-in-hand with the local providers to get them back on their feet,\u201d SGT Thomas Calvert said in the press release. \u201cThe overarching aim is to get each dialysis facility to a self-sustaining status and back to normal operations as soon as possible.\u201d \nWhile an emphasis has been placed on helping locals, especially those with chronic conditions, get back to normal, there are long-term concerns that will need to be addressed for the foreseeable future. Long-Term Threats \n\u201cOne of the biggest long term risks is a resurgence of Zika Virus,\u201d said Dr. Evans. \u201cPuerto Rico is a warm climate, and damage caused may also mean that the [leftover] water can\u2019t drain off, and is left standing for a long period of time. This is a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. We know that Zika is in Puerto Rico, and my concern now is that there could be a lot of transmission and a resurgence.\u201d \nMosquito-borne disease outbreaks are concerning, but not all long-term problems are physical. \n\u201cHurricane survivors can face mental health issues like PTSD, anxiety, depression and substance use disorders long after rescue and recovery efforts end,\u201d said Christine Guardino, psychology professor at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. \u201cFor example, one study of survivors of Hurricane Katrina found that 31 percent of respondents showed symptoms of mood or anxiety disorders several months after the storm.\u201d \n\u201cIndividuals who are personally injured or experience the death or injury of a loved one are especially likely to experience mental health issues. Forced relocation due to hurricane damage can also separate vulnerable individuals from their families, social services and health care facilities, contributing to distress and impairment,\u201d Guardino added. \u201cEarly identification of those who have experienced trauma followed by mental health intervention can help to prevent long-term mental health problems.\u201d What Needs to Be Done \nDr. Evans stressed that the problems linked to Hurricane Maria won\u2019t just go away, and that people can\u2019t forget about Puerto Rico. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s important that we take action to provide an aid package to Puerto Rico as quickly as possible, and to continue to support these people,\u201d Evans said. \nWe\u2019ve seen what these storms \u2014 Hurricanes Matthew, Irma and Maria \u2014 can do, Evans warned. \u201cIt is important to have a robust emergency response. We need to have the public health infrastructure to respond.\u201d \nThe Weather Company\u2019s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.
