File image of Ben Stokes. AFP \nBlewett, who struck a century on his test debut during the 1994-95 Ashes series, cast doubt on Stokes\u2019s chances of playing a full part in the series. \n\u201cI\u2018m sure they will (sanction him). They are having their internal investigation. That will play out,\u201d Blewett, a 46-test righthanded batsman, told Reuters in an interview in Adelaide on Tuesday. \n\u201cIt would be a shame if he\u2019s not out here. I think everyone wants to play against the strongest possible team. \n\u201cIt would be a shame if he doesn\u2019t come out because he\u2019s a bit of a drawcard, he\u2019s a world class all-rounder and will leave a massive hole in their team. \n\u201cBut even if he was (to come), I think Australia are going to be too good at home anyway. With or without Ben Stokes I don\u2019t see a different result but I think England would love to have him in their side.\u201d \nThe Sun newspaper published footage of what it said was a brawl between the player and two other people, one clutching a bottle. The authenticity of the images could not be verified by Reuters. \nMedia reports said Stokes, who suffered a minor fracture of a finger on his right hand, apologised to the ECB for his arrest on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm and described his state of mind as \u2018fragile and devastated\u2019. \nBlewett, who was Australia\u2019s fielding coach until stepping down in August, has taken on assistant roles with Sheffield Shield side South Australia and the Adelaide Strikers in the \u2018Big Bash\u2019 domestic Twenty20 competition. \nAlso coach of South Australia\u2019s men\u2019s under-19 side, Blewett said he would take a dim view of any player out drinking in the early hours of the morning and days before a match. \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be over the moon, put it that way, because I did see the footage and it\u2019s not great,\u201d Blewett said, referring to the video posted by The Sun. \n\u201dI\u2018m sure he\u2019s got his side to the story which we haven\u2019t necessarily heard yet. \n\u201cYeah, you would be disappointed, I think they were only a couple of days away from the next one-day international so I think any coach would be disappointed with that sort of behaviour.\u201d \nThe Stokes incident has revived the debate as to whether curfews should be enforced during series, but Blewett said he was against such measures. \n\u201cGenerally, you\u2019d say players these days are a hell of a lot more professional than what we used to be,\u201d said the 45-year-old. \n\u201cThese things don\u2019t pop up all that often these days, but when they do, obviously you need to address it.\u201d \nThe potential absence of Stokes would heap further pressure on England\u2019s bowlers and a batting order featuring players like opener James Vince and Dawid Malan who are yet to establish themselves. \nBlewett said Australia and the team\u2019s formidable pace attack led by Mitchell Starc would provide the toughest of initiations. \n\u201cTwo or three of those guys in the squad haven\u2019t had a great start to their careers,\u201d he said. \n\u201dIt\u2019s not going to get any easier when they come out here. \n\u201cAnd it\u2019s looking like Australia are going to be full strength with their bowling attack so (they) are going to be up against it.\u201d \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 04:15 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 04:15 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:04:49.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf53e5f7b9462e8631c07a5a5bb8c25d050eb5ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8lRp.HpcpQWXPNh1c.7QIyMmE1AXKqOAG8kus27f7CtQ96l3Cy4AvXBw77dc1HGZeVz7WsnsTpSR5Mpr2ZRay6nGK.VL5pNB6m_dKhScqtHVQpPDMSfot7QouU_VprbJ1sWb2ls3kJyOkcXLZw0r7EeK6y6qmfMezn2SC7dUfduA--", "site_full": "www.fakingnews.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/fakingnews", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Faking News", "title": "Company introduces \u2018Aditya Narayan-proof underwear\u2019, says no one can remove it once worn", "title_full": "Company introduces \u2018Aditya Narayan-proof underwear\u2019, says no one can remove it once worn", "published": "2017-10-03T13:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/WATCH-Aditya-Narayan-caught-on-camera-misbehaving-with-airline-staff.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2799, "comments": 5, "shares": 2799}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cf53e5f7b9462e8631c07a5a5bb8c25d050eb5ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8lRp.HpcpQWXPNh1c.7QIyMmE1AXKqOAG8kus27f7CtQ96l3Cy4AvXBw77dc1HGZeVz7WsnsTpSR5Mpr2ZRay6nGK.VL5pNB6m_dKhScqtHVQpPDMSfot7QouU_VprbJ1sWb2ls3kJyOkcXLZw0r7EeK6y6qmfMezn2SC7dUfduA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "@jurnoleast", "published": "2017-10-03T13:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Company introduces \u2018Aditya Narayan-proof underwear\u2019, says no one can remove it once worn", "text": "Company introduces 'Aditya Narayan-proof underwear', says no one can remove it once worn 03, Oct 2017 By @jurnoleast \nAditya Narayan, who was in the midst of an ugly spat with the staff of Indigo airlines, may have got himself into a controversy, but his outburst has inspired Amul Macho to come out with an underwear which the company claims is practically \u2018unremovable\u2019 once worn. \nSpeaking to Faking News a company executive said, \u201cWe are always in the look out for news and innovative product and we spotted a opportunity when we heard him scream \u2018 mai teri chaddi utaar doonga\u2019 .

"Amid mounting criticism, Donald Trump heads to Puerto Rico to survey damage of Hurricane Maria World AP Oct, 03 2017 16:37:27 IST Tweet \nWashington: US president Donald Trump is heading to San Juan on Tuesday to meet with some of the 3.4 million Puerto Ricans struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria, as criticism that the federal government's response has been sluggish continues. \nThe president is expected to spend more than five hours on the island, meeting with first responders, local officials and some of the residents struggling to recover from a hurricane that, in Trump's words, left the island US territory \"flattened.\" President Donald Trump speaks to reporters about Puerto Rico. AP \n\"There's nothing left. It's been wiped out,\" Trump said last week. \"Nobody has ever seen anything like it.\" \nThe trip will be Trump's fourth to a region battered by storms during an unusually violent hurricane season that has also seen parts of Texas, Florida, Louisiana and the US Virgin Islands inundated by floodwaters and whipped by winds. \nTrump and First Lady Melania Trump are scheduled to attend briefings and meet with Governor Ricardo Rossell, as well as the governor of the US Virgin Islands. They'll also meet with navy and marine corps personnel on the flight Deck of the USS Kearsarge. \nEven before the storm hit on 20 September, Puerto Rico was in dire condition thanks to a decade-long economic recession that had left its infrastructure, including the island's power lines, in a sorry state. \nMaria was the most powerful hurricane to hit the island in nearly a century and unleashed floods and mudslides that knocked out the island's entire electrical grid and telecommunications, along with many roads. \nNearly two weeks later, 95 percent of electricity customers remain without power, including some hospitals. And much of the countryside is still struggling to access basic necessities, including food, fresh water and cash. \nTrump and other administration officials have worked in recent days to reassure Americans that recovery efforts are going well and combat the perception that the president failed to fully grasp the magnitude of the storm's destruction in its immediate aftermath. \nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the trip would focus on local recovery efforts, \"which we're fully committed to.\" \n\"The top priority for the federal government is certainly to protect the lives and the safety of those in affected areas and provide life-sustaining services as we work together to rebuild their lives,\" she said. \nWhile early response efforts were hampered by logistical challenges, officials say that conditions, especially in the capital, have improved. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 04:37 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 04:37 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ricardo rossell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah huckabee sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melania trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us virgin islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:35:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d90b0480bed60e253a81c90679f880740b27d8f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWE0TUpblGkukpWUzE9vP.3xiD7iku0.7o42J.wXduA3hfVWziqjGpjegmybakTMCIcBIHt734JFnnKTP8QRB6YR1EYdoQxq5r3LCPBlzlmGtEPprutOoS2MFze9.AmfGZd", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/firstpost/xfJh?utm_source=fp_footer", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "SC to hear plea challenging deportation of Rohingya Muslims on 13 October", "title_full": "SC to hear plea challenging deportation of Rohingya Muslims on 13 October", "published": "2017-10-03T14:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Supreme_Court_Reuters.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 29, "comments": 0, "shares": 29}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d90b0480bed60e253a81c90679f880740b27d8f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWE0TUpblGkukpWUzE9vP.3xiD7iku0.7o42J.wXduA3hfVWziqjGpjegmybakTMCIcBIHt734JFnnKTP8QRB6YR1EYdoQxq5r3LCPBlzlmGtEPprutOoS2MFze9.AmfGZd", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PTI", "published": "2017-10-03T14:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "SC to hear plea challenging deportation of Rohingya Muslims on 13 October", "text": "SC to hear plea challenging deportation of Rohingya Muslims on 13 October India PTI Oct, 03 2017 20:37:31 IST \nNew Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday decided to hear on 13 October the petition filed by Rohingya Muslims challenging the government's stand to deport them back to Myanmar. File image of the Supreme Court. AP \nThe apex court said it will hear the arguments only on the points of law and asked the parties to desist from advancing emotional arguments as the matter concerned humanitarian cause and humanity, which required to be heard with mutual respect. \nA bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra asked both the parties, the Centre and the two Rohingya Muslim refugees who have filed the petition, to compile all documents and international conventions for assisting the court. \nThe bench, also comprising justices AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud, said it will hear in details various aspects arising out of the matter, including the government's stand that the petition was not justiciable in the court of law. \nSenior advocate Fali S Nariman, appearing for the petitioner Rohingya refugees, opposed the government stand and said the petition under Article 32 was maintainable as the Constitution guaranteed individual rights. \nAdditional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted that the government would not like the matter to be heard in a piecemeal manner as it has wide ramifications and added that it would prefer a day for detailed hearing. \nHe sought listing of the matters on some other date for a detailed hearing and submitted that the government would not like the matter to be heard in a piecemeal manner as it had wide ramifications. \nSenior advocate Fali S Nariman, appearing for Rohingya immigrants Mohammad Salimullah and Mohammad Shaqir, started his submission on a lighter vein, saying \"I am the original refugee from Burma\" and had migrated from \"British Burma to British India\". \nHe assailed the Centre's stand that illegal refugees cannot claim protection of their fundamental rights under the Constitution as it would adversely affect the rights of Indian citizens and that the issue was \"not justiciable\". \n\"Humanitarian concern for children, women, the sick outweigh justiciability,\" Nariman said, adding the objection that the matter was \"not justiciable\" was very serious as the Constitution protects the rights of non-citizens as well. \n\"The rights of the persons who happen to be in India deserve constitutional protection,\" he said, adding that the government was contradicting itself while referring to a past notification on ways to deal with migrants, mostly Hindus and Buddhists, from Pakistan and Bangladesh who had suffered persecution. \nHe said terrorists from any group should be dealt with as per the law but simultaneously, innocent refugees including women and children need protection. \nA terse response of senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for the National Human Rights Commission, to the Centre's objections was strongly contested by ASG Mehta who said \"one does not need to abuse to counter\". \nSumming up the arguments advanced by Nariman, the bench said the government cannot \"simply paint\" everybody as a terrorist and that India is a signatory to various international conventions. \nOn the issue of non-justiciabilty, the bench observed that the court should be \"very slow in abdicating its jurisdiction\". \nEarlier, the Centre in an affidavit had termed Rohingya refugees as \"illegal\" immigrants and said some of them were part of a \"sinister\" design of Pakistan's ISI and terror groups such as the Islamic State, whose presence in the country will pose a \"serious\" national security threat. \nThe affidavit was submitted in response to a plea filed by the Rohingya immigrants, claiming they had taken refuge in India after escaping from Myanmar due to widespread discrimination, violence and bloodshed against the community there. \nVarious other petitions, including those by former RSS ideologue and Rashtriya Swabhiman Andolan leader KN Govindacharaya, the West Bengal child rights body and BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, have been filed in the apex court on the issue. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 08:32 pm | Updated Date: Oct

were sceptical on Tuesday about their chances of ever going home to Myanmar, even though the government there has given an assurance it would accept people verified as refugees. \nMore than half a million Rohingya have fled from a Myanmar military crackdown in Rakhine State launched in late August that has been denounced by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing and placed a huge burden on Bangladesh. Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar disembark from boats as they continue their journey to Bangladesh. AP \nMyanmar denies ethnic cleansing, saying it is only fighting Rohingya terrorists who have claimed attacks on the security forces. The government has said anyone verified as a refugee from Myanmar will be allowed to return under a process agreed with Bangladesh in 1993. \nBangladesh and Myanmar agreed on Monday to work on a repatriation plan, and a Myanmar government spokesman confirmed it would go along with process, provided people could verify their status with paperwork. \nBut many refugees are scornful. \n\"Everything was burned, even people were burned,\" said a refugee who identified himself as Abdullah, dismissing the chances that people would have documents to prove a right to stay in Myanmar. \nAt the root of the problem is the refusal by Buddhist-majority Myanmar to grant citizenship to members of a Muslim minority seen by a mostly unsympathetic, if not hostile, society as interlopers from Bangladesh. \nThough Myanmar has not granted Rohingya citizenship, under the 1993 procedure, it agreed to take back people who could prove they had been Myanmar residents. \nBut a day after Bangladesh and Myanmar announced apparent progress, a Bangladeshi foreign ministry official appeared resigned to a difficult process. \n\"This is still a long procedure,\" said the official, who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media. \nThere were already about 3,00,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh before the latest exodus, but Myanmar had said it would only take back those who arrived after October 2016 - when a military offensive in response to Rohingya insurgent attacks sent 87,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh - \"subject to verification\", the official said. \n\"We said that many Rohingya refugees have no documents, so this process should be flexible. Myanmar said they will decide who will get involved in the verification,\" the official said, adding Bangladesh wanted international agencies to be involved. \nMyanmar's government spokesman said under the 1993 pact, even a hospital record was enough to prove residency, but it was only Myanmar, and not Bangladesh, that could verify citizenship. \n\"We have a policy for the repatriation process and we will go along with that policy,\" the spokesman, Zaw Htay, told Reuters . \nBreak their promise \nBut even if refugees had documents, many are wary about returning without an assurance of full citizenship, which they fear could leave them vulnerable to the persecution and curbs they have endured for years. \nAmina Katu, 60, laughed at the thought of returning. \n\"If we go there, we\u2019ll just have to come back here,\" she said. \"If they give us our rights, we will go, but people did this before and they had to return.\" \nLast month, Anwar Begum told Reuters she had now fled from Myanmar three times. The first time was to escape a 1978 crackdown, and she returned the following year. She fled again in 1991 and returned in 1994. \n\"I don't want to go back,\" the 55-year-old added. \"I don't believe the government. Every time the government agrees we can go back, then we're there and they break their promise.\" \nInvestigators appointed by Suu Kyi and led by former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan recommended in August that Myanmar review a 1982 law that links citizenship and ethnicity and leaves most Rohingya stateless. \nStatelessness was at the root of the problem, UN high commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told a meeting in Geneva on Monday. \n\"Nowhere is the link between statelessness and displacement more evident than with the Rohingya community of Myanmar, for whom denial of citizenship is a key aspect of the discrimination and exclusion that have shaped their plight,\" he said. \nGrandi also called for a two-track approach to tackle issues of citizenship and rights and inclusive development to stamp out poverty in Rakhine State. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 04:34 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 04:34 pm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "worl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "grandi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suu kyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anwar begum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "filippo grandi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zaw htay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amina katu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kofi annan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdullah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters oct", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohingya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "myanmar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rakhine state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:35:47.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "429908aa0acc19d84e1ca20953a05ff8afaed49b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWE4HhHYK1wT6s.zq2d.5wMbwvgYvbtSynaivTRpFkuzMt271tbwi4sVrOudOWab_p9WJw3NHoNOmpaT2Vp7j910CY_Exy9OwBzLYAIb8invfZ3WHyYJSSQVNSs6VFBNTi_Qk7UyNcZZoxjsdzbKkKy_Q0LYhTZ6qB2Z3OuHnD3uvY-", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/firstpost/xfJh?utm_source=fp_footer", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Narendra Modi\u2019s Bilaspur visit: PM inaugurates AIIMS in Himachal Pradesh; ushers IIITs as beginning of \u2018new era\u2019", "title_full": "Narendra Modi\u2019s Bilaspur visit: PM inaugurates AIIMS in Himachal Pradesh; ushers IIITs as beginning of \u2018new era\u2019", "published": "2017-10-03T14:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Narendra_Modi_Reuters2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 84, "comments": 0, "shares": 84}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "429908aa0acc19d84e1ca20953a05ff8afaed49b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWE4HhHYK1wT6s.zq2d.5wMbwvgYvbtSynaivTRpFkuzMt271tbwi4sVrOudOWab_p9WJw3NHoNOmpaT2Vp7j910CY_Exy9OwBzLYAIb8invfZ3WHyYJSSQVNSs6VFBNTi_Qk7UyNcZZoxjsdzbKkKy_Q0LYhTZ6qB2Z3OuHnD3uvY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PTI", "published": "2017-10-03T14:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Narendra Modi\u2019s Bilaspur visit: PM inaugurates AIIMS in Himachal Pradesh; ushers IIITs as beginning of \u2018new era\u2019", "text": "Narendra Modi's Bilaspur visit: PM inaugurates AIIMS in Himachal Pradesh; ushers IIITs as beginning of 'new era' India PTI Oct, 03 2017 16:42:42 IST Tweet \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday championed Himachal Pradesh as a tourist spot and said that access to an AIIMS hospital will make tourists visit the state more frequently while laying the foundation of a new AIIMS centre in Bilaspur.

men\u2019s under-19 side, Blewett said he would take a dim view of any player out drinking in the early hours of the morning and days before a match. \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be over the moon, put it that way, because I did see the footage and it\u2019s not great,\u201d Blewett said, referring to the video posted by The Sun. \n\u201dI\u2018m sure he\u2019s got his side to the story which we haven\u2019t necessarily heard yet. \n\u201cYeah, you would be disappointed, I think they were only a couple of days away from the next one-day international so I think any coach would be disappointed with that sort of behaviour.\u201d \nThe Stokes incident has revived the debate as to whether curfews should be enforced during series, but Blewett said he was against such measures. \n\u201cGenerally, you\u2019d say players these days are a hell of a lot more professional than what we used to be,\u201d said the 45-year-old. \n\u201cThese things don\u2019t pop up all that often these days, but when they do, obviously you need to address it.\u201d \nThe potential absence of Stokes would heap further pressure on England\u2019s bowlers and a batting order featuring players like opener James Vince and Dawid Malan who are yet to establish themselves. \nBlewett said Australia and the team\u2019s formidable pace attack led by Mitchell Starc would provide the toughest of initiations. \n\u201cTwo or three of those guys in the squad haven\u2019t had a great start to their careers,\u201d he said. \n\u201dIt\u2019s not going to get any easier when they come out here. \n\u201cAnd it\u2019s looking like Australia are going to be full strength with their bowling attack so (they) are going to be up against it.\u201d Published Date:", "highlightText": "",

secure a bail within three hours. Soon after a Westminster Court had granted him bail and the liquor King didn't waste any time to tweet out his victorious statement: \"Usual Indian media hype. Extradition hearing in Court started today as expected,\" Mallya had said in his tweet. \nRead more details here . 17:27 (IST) \nVijay Mallya arrested in London | Doordarshan \nWanted millionaire Vijay Mallya has been arrested in relation to the ongoing money laundering case, Doordarshan News said in a tweet on Tuesday. \nAccording to reports, the Enforcement Directorate had filed a fresh affidavit with a London court submitting fresh evidence on the different loans that Mallya had taken from various courts in India, and how the funds were diverted. \n\"The CBI case and the ED case is now going to be clubbed,\" CNN-News18 said. \nLiquor baron Vijay Mallya has been arrested in London in the ongoing extradition proceedings in a court, according to a report in Doordarshan . \nThe arrest comes after the Enforcement Directorate submitted an affidavit in the ongoing money laundering case being heard in the court. \nIn a bid to strengthen the evidence to extradite the business man, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate had recently prepared a charge sheet alleging he laundered a major chunk of the Rs 6,000 crore bank loans taken for Kingfisher Airlines. A file photo of Vijay Mallya. PTI \nA report in The Times of India said recently that the money was diverted through shell companies in seven countries, including the US, the UK, France and Ireland. \n\"Letters rogatory have already been sent to the US, the UK, France and Ireland and we will get complete details soon,\" an official has been quoted as saying in the report. The official has claimed that the agencies have been able to establish the links between the shell companies and bank accounts in the seven countries. \nExplaining the systematic way in which Mallya duped the banks, the official said he used to pay back some part of the loan to the banks to gain their confidence to get more funds from them. \nThe latest evidence will be submitted before the London court where the final extradition hearing will take place in December. At present, in front of the UK court, the agencies have presented the charge s in the nearly Rs 900 crore IDBI Bank loan default case. \nEarlier, in a charge sheet filed in June, the ED had alleged that Mallya had laundered amount worth Rs 1,300 crore through 13 shell companies, which he has denied. Mallya has maintained that he has not done anything wrong and huge dues to the banks have been due to the failure of the business. \nThe ED had also said that these shell companies had no actual activities and was fully contrlolled by Mallya with former employees of UB group being its directors. \nThe agency had said the only purpose of these companies were to either obtain loan or launder money and that he has huge property in the US in the name of his daughters - Leana and Tanya. \nMallya has been in self-imposed exile in the UK since March 2016. He was arrested by Scotland Yard on an extradition warrant on 18 April and is currently out on bail. \nThe Indian investigative agencies are seeking to extradite Mallya for allegedly defaulting on several bank loans amounting to nearly Rs 9,000 crore. This includes loan taken from IDBI Bank for Kingfisher Airlines. \nThe total loan sanctioned and disbursed by the IDBI Bank to KFA was Rs 860.92 crore. The ED has alleged that its \u201cmoney trail analysis revealed that out of the total loan of Rs 860.92 crore, sanctioned and disbursed by IDBI, Rs 423 crore has been remitted out of India. \nThe said payments were shown to be made towards aircraft rental leasing and maintenance, servicing and spare parts.\u201c \nThe ED had in an earlier charge sheet filed in the IDBI-KFA case said Mallya floated 20 shell companies, directors of which were either his personal staff or those who retired. \n(With inputs from PTI) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vijay mallya", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mallya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tanya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vidya ram", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cbi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "idbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westminster court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central bureau of investigation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingfisher airlines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kfa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idbi bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doordarshan news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ub", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enforcement directorate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:38:00.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a1a31da5a164df76d60366406aa528c1109f088e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEFBiIjOhFOknqtMLYofNDMdLdJ1rn9n2_YVNu3UNNHXZWE891xNhALBp9n5jYiApPlnUXDC8VCYJdoB6.zm7qndNz2eYRUbrRuutW2fPWtmrqauxbeNA0iixc8MZw_1fHPjPw.gVyBRl.MT1zqCPtD0VVer9Fmz9f", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/firstpost/xfJh", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Chennai multiplexes go on strike to protest against levying of additional tax over GST", "title_full": "Chennai multiplexes go on strike to protest against levying of additional tax over GST", "published": "2017-10-03T15:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cinema_SOCIAL.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 120, "comments": 0, "shares": 120}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a1a31da5a164df76d60366406aa528c1109f088e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEFBiIjOhFOknqtMLYofNDMdLdJ1rn9n2_YVNu3UNNHXZWE891xNhALBp9n5jYiApPlnUXDC8VCYJdoB6.zm7qndNz2eYRUbrRuutW2fPWtmrqauxbeNA0iixc8MZw_1fHPjPw.gVyBRl.MT1zqCPtD0VVer9Fmz9f", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "IANS", "published": "2017-10-03T15:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chennai multiplexes go on strike to protest against levying of additional tax over GST", "text": "Chennai multiplexes go on strike to protest against levying of additional tax over GST Entertainment IANS Oct, 03 2017 17:51:36 IST \nMultiplexes in Chennai went on strike on 3 October to protest against the levying of an additional tax over and above the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the Multiplex Association of India (MAI) announced.

He won almost 54 percent of votes in the first round of voting against three other candidates. \nAfter being named NDP leader, he tweeted , \"I\u2019m officially launching my campaign to be the next Prime Minister of Canada.\" \nSingh was born into a Punjabi Indian family in Scarborough, Ontario. He often wears a brightly coloured turban and usually wears a kirpan , a knife carried by Sikh men which is banned in certain places in Canada. Canadian leader Jagmeet Singh after his first-ballot triumph in the contest for leader of the leftist NDP. AP \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau congratulated Singh on his election. \"I look forward to speaking soon and working together for Canadians,\" he wrote on Twitter. \nSingh is a member of the Ontario provincial member parliament, not of the federal parliament in Ottawa \u2014 meaning he cannot press Trudeau during the daily question period. He hinted during his campaign he would not immediately seek a seat, which would require the resignation of an elected official to give him a place in a constituency where he could easily win. \nSingh creates the same kind of buzz that Trudeau does \nLike the photogenic prime minister, Singh has been splashed across the pages of a glossy style magazine \u2014 GQ in his case, Vogue in Trudeau\u2019s \u2014 and generates the same kind of buzz that Trudeau does despite a smaller platform as a provincial legislator in Ontario. \nHe uses Twitter (@theJagmeetSingh) to make policy announcements and statements \u2014 a series of tweets explaining why he wanted to be party leader went viral in June and was featured on BuzzFeed \u2014 while his YouTube channel showcases legislative work. \nUsing fashion to disarm people and create conversation \nSingh, who said as a young man he was subject to random stops by police, says the racial discrimination he suffered in his youth gives him an edge over his rivals. \n\u201cThere are a lot of Canadians that have faced certain struggles in their lives... they see in me someone who understands those struggles,\u201d he said at a vegan restaurant in between events. \nHis practice of wearing natty suits and turbans that vary from shocking pink to lime green dates back to his lawyer days when he was trying to dispel negative perceptions. His solution was to stand out as much as possible. \u201cIt disarms people and it creates conversations. So fashion for me has been used as a tool to engage people, to disrupt their normal notions of someone who looks like me,\u201d he said. \nViral video \nSingh catapulted to online fame after a video of his calm response to an anti-Islam tirade by a woman at a campaign event in Brampton, Ontario received much approbation. \nThe woman, who identified herself as Jennifer in the video, thrust herself in front of Singh before he was about to speak and said, \"We know you're in bed with Sharia. We know you're in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood.\" \nDespite efforts by the organisers and supporters to take her aside, Jennifer refused to be removed and threatened to call the police. \nInstead of responding aggressively to her boisterous attack, Singh calmly responded to the crowd: \"We believe in love and courage... We don't want to be intimidated by hate, we don't want hatred to ruin a positive event... So let's show people how to treat someone with love: We welcome you. We love you. We support you.\" \nA video of the exchange went viral and has received over 7 lakh views and shared over 4,000 times on Facebook. Brampton Focus , a local news outlet, caught the exchange on camera and uploaded it on its Facebook page which can be viewed here: \nThe video shows his supporters chanting \"Jagmeet\" and \"love and courage\" before breaking into applause. \nThe India (dis)connection \nSingh is known to be forthright on issues and has earlier criticised US President Donald Trump's travel ban as well as has spoken out against India's treatment of minorities, according to The Times of India . In 2013, he was denied a visa to visit India. According to Singh, he had been selected as Sikh of the Year by two NGOs and had to visit Amritsar for the award ceremony. \nIn 2016, he had moved motion in the Ontraio Assembly seeking to describe the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in India as \u201cgenocide\u201d, reported Hindustan Times . The motion in a slightly different form was passed in 2017 after it was brought by a Liberal Party MPP. Singh spoke during the debate, severely criticising the Indian government. \nIn 2017, he accused India of interfering with his campaign by using its influence to stop members of his community from backing him. \nThese reasons have garnered him support from pro-Khalistan elements as well, says Hindustan Times. In fact, when the NDP leadership results were announced, a leading separatist figure, Sukhminder Singh Hansra, was present in the room. \nElectoral chances \nWhile Singh has won the initial voting, he will have an uphill battle when he challenges Trudeau's governing Liberal Party in the next election. Singh's party has just 44 of the 338 seats in Parliament. The party lags well behind the centrist Liberals and right-leaning Conservatives in political fundraising this year, according to Elections Canada data. Singh will now focus on rallying supporters and targeting centre-left voters who helped propel Trudeau\u2019s Liberals to a decisive victory in 2015. \nThere are hurdles ahead. Singh needs to persuade voters that his party can form a government, although it has never held power federally. There are also questions over whether he will have success in Quebec, Canada\u2019s mainly French-speaking province, where overt signs of faith are frowned upon. \nSingh\u2019s most realistic hope is to take over the party and win enough seats in 2019 to deprive Trudeau of his majority in Parliament. That would leave the Liberals dependent on the NDP, who could then demand concessions in return for support. \nIpsos Public Affairs pollster Darrell Bricker calls Singh \u201ca dangerous candidate\u201d for Trudeau, especially in the Toronto region which accounts for about 20 percent of Parliament seats. \"When you look at what happens here, if he can have any impact on the vote at all it\u2019s a threat,\" he said. \nWith inputs from agencies \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 05:33 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 05:33 pm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "justin trudeau", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jagmeet singh", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sukhminder singh hansra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darrell bricker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hindustan times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brampton focus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim brotherhood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal party mpp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the times of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipsos public affairs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elections canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ndp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india tweet  canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vogue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brampton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontraio assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarborough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quebec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amritsar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ottawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontario", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:38:13.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "073373053ee9be539f0672e0ac840c5759e8fd63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWENWZ0YDKJUfaC_kJx1aXBU9g4ynnD4u7QKXpRFHipmF5XtWo26O4p0Q501XxBKNzU5bqx9KRqg7FxC3F5VesuseQPsa4rsNAmbiQ7Myn91qksZug1a1Eju1bNp0USWnqnIycMLDoX9tBTWo284lmJBMDCjNDVpb24HkFRGGv5IxKbU3ORoU7GIA--", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/firstpost/xfJh", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Three youths clicking selfies on railway tracks run over by train between Bengaluru\u2019s Hejjala and Bidadi stations", "title_full": "Three youths clicking selfies on railway tracks run over by train between Bengaluru\u2019s Hejjala and Bidadi stations", "published": "2017-10-03T14:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Railway-station_news18.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 44, "comments": 0, "shares": 44}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "073373053ee9be539f0672e0ac840c5759e8fd63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWENWZ0YDKJUfaC_kJx1aXBU9g4ynnD4u7QKXpRFHipmF5XtWo26O4p0Q501XxBKNzU5bqx9KRqg7FxC3F5VesuseQPsa4rsNAmbiQ7Myn91qksZug1a1Eju1bNp0USWnqnIycMLDoX9tBTWo284lmJBMDCjNDVpb24HkFRGGv5IxKbU3ORoU7GIA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "IANS", "published": "2017-10-03T14:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Three youths clicking selfies on railway tracks run over by train between Bengaluru\u2019s Hejjala and Bidadi stations", "text": "Three youths clicking selfies on railway tracks run over by train between Bengaluru's Hejjala and Bidadi stations India IANS Oct, 03 2017 17:27:56 IST \nBengaluru: Three youths were run over by a train on Tuesday while they were reportedly clicking selfies on the railway tracks in Bengaluru, police said. \nThe incident took place at around 8.30 am between Hejjala and Bidadi stations. \n\"The youths were run over by the Golgumbaz Express going to Mysuru from Bengaluru.

Perhaps this is the reason that the anti-hero has lured every actor ever since films existed \u2014 right from right a Paul Muni in Scarface (1932) or Edward G Robinson in Little Caesar (1931), Ashok Kumar in Kismet (1943), Dev Anand in Baazi (1951), Sunil Dutt in Mother India (1957), Dilip Kumar in Ganga Jumna (1961), Amitabh Bachchan in Namak Haraam (1973) and Deewar (1979) to Shah Rukh Khan in Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993) to Kangana Ranaut in Revolver Rani (2014) \u2014 and now with Padmavati where he portrays Alauddin Khilji, Ranveer Singh finally gets his chance at doing away with the shackles of morality. \nFollowing both his co-stars, Deepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoor, Singh\u2019s Khilji \u2018look\u2019 was finally revealed to the public. There had been a lot of speculation about the manner in which Singh would interpret the character. Looking at the image on the poster where the actor\u2019s \u201c kohled eyes \u201d and long hair suggest a rugged, and dare I say, even a metrosexual Khilji, Singh\u2019s eyes seem to reveal a sadistic streak within the anti-hero that he is said to be portraying. The actor had previously played a somewhat depraved character in Gunday (2014) but that was more of a tribute to the Hindi films of the 1970s, a decade that saw the emergence of the anti-hero in its full glory in popular Hindi cinema. Despite largely playing characters where not much would have been offered to Singh at a basic level to experiment with physically, his tenacity and near-chameleon kind of ability to physically become the character promises his Khilji to be this generation\u2019s definition of the anti-hero. Ranveer Singh's looks as Alauddin Khilji in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmavati. Images courtesy Twitter/@RanveerOfficial \nThe anti-hero in contemporary Bollywood in films like Aurangzeb (2013), Gunday (2014) or Badlapur (2015), for instance, all seem to be cut from the same fabric that was used to portray \u2018heroes\u2019 back in the era of the Angry Young Man. Before Amitabh Bachchan transformed the Angry Young Man into a hero, the \u2018anti-hero\u2019 was one of the most successful characters in the repertoire of many leading men. Ashok Kumar in Kismet would be among the first instances of a leading man exploring the anti-hero but it was only with Dev Anand that the character became a regular feature in some varying degree for them. Dev Anand enjoyed one of his biggest hits in Baazi and later portrayed the anti-hero with great panache in Jaal. Although it was Sunil Dutt who portrayed an early unapologetic anti-hero that came closest to being a villain in Mother India it was Dilip Kumar who took the anti-hero to great heights with Ganga Jumna. \nWhile many credit screenwriters Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar with the perfect anti-hero in the form of the Angry Young Man character they created with Zanjeer (1973), the seeds for this anti-hero were sown a few years earlier. It wouldn\u2019t be totally off the mark to imagine that it was perhaps Yash Chopra\u2019s Aadmi Aur Insaan (1969) that gave us the anti-hero in the form of the Jai Kishan or JK, the character portrayed by Feroz Khan, who wasn\u2019t apologetic for whatever he did. He was rich but unlike most leading men from the 1960s, far from repentant about it and never felt a moral conundrum when bending the rules. In fact, Bachchan\u2019s character in Hrishikesh Mukherjee\u2019s Namak Haraam is also in some way an upgraded version of JK and a character more worthy of the angry young man tag than Zanjeer, which released in the same year. Aadmi Aur Insaan and Namk Haraam were written by Akhtar-Ul-Iman and Hrishikesh Mukherjee respectively ( Namak Haraam \u2019s screenplay was penned by Gulzar and DN Mukherjee) and played a great role in shaping the Angry Young Man. \nAlthough it was Sunil Dutt who portrayed an early unapologetic anti-hero that came closest to being a villain in Mother India it was Dilip Kumar who took the anti-hero to great heights with Ganga Jumna. \nJaved Akhtar has often said that it was the environment of the 1970s that inspired him to come with his own version of the hero. This Angry Young Man took from the anti-heroes that preceded him but as things progressed, blurred the line between being a \u2018hero\u2019 and the \u2018villain\u2019. Was it the alacrity with which he was lapped up by the viewers that he soon became the hero despite his flaws? So, while the end of Deewar is justified in terms of the morality factor \u2014 the anti-hero Vijay (Bachchan) takes to crime and much to the dismay of his mother (Nirupa Roy) refuses to mend his ways and is finally killed by his own younger police officer brother Ravi (Shashi Kapoor) \u2014 the criminal emerges as the hero. Even though some of the biggest Angry Young Man hits were high on realism as opposed to other popular hits of the era ( Trishul , Kala Patthar , and Shakti ), the bigger a star Bachchan became, the further this template went from any semblance of reality \nBoth Ranveer Singh and Padmavati seem poised to add a new facet to the manner in which present-day Bollywood interprets the anti-hero. Traditionally, contemporary anti-heroes in Hindi cinema have all focused on the bad choices that they make \u2014 Shah Rukh Khan in Darr , Baazigar and Anjaam and more recently Varun Dhawan in Badlapur \u2014 as compared to the good that they don\u2019t want to do. In Khilji, Ranveer Singh might find a chance to play a character for whom making bad choices is the only interesting thing and yet being the \u2018hero\u2019 in terms of box office appeal would push the narrative to explore the good that his villainous Khilji believes he is doing. On the face of it, this might also be a foregone conclusion considering the manner in which Sanjay Leela Bhansali models his characters even when they are on real figures. But could a small part of this also be because the narrative appears to play on the very element that makes any anti-hero drama more potent \u2014 the inverse morality? \n 00  00 pm", "highlightText":

an innings and 26 runs to win the two-match unofficial 'Test' series 2-0, in Vijaywada on Tuesday. \nAfter scoring 211 in their first innings, the visitors managed only 210 in their second essay, courtesy another batting collapse despite starting the final day at 104 for 1. File image of India A's spinner Karn Sharma. Getty Images \nIndia A had scored 447 in their only innings. \nLeg-spinner Karn (5/78 in 20.3 overs) and left-arm spinner Nadeem (4/41 in 26 overs) ran through the opposition line-up as they added only 106 runs losing nine wickets in the process. Pacer Shardul Thakur took the other wicket. \nAfter a match haul of eight wickets in the first game, Railways' Karn once again got another eight wickets (8/129) in the second match. \nHenry Nicholls (94) played a lone hand, which incidentally wasn't enough as none of the other batsmen were able to support him. \nSave the second wicket stand of 105 runs between Jeet Raval and Nicholls, there wasn't a single partnership of more than 30 runs. \nNew Zealand A have been completely outclassed in the series having lost the first 'Test' by an innings and 31 runs. \nThe batsmen simply didn't have any clue how to negotiate Karn-Nadeem duo. While Karn ended the series with 16 wickets, Nadeem wasn't far behind with 14 in his kitty. \nBrief Scores : \nNew Zealand: 211 & 210 (Henry Nicholls 94; Karn Sharma 5/78, Shahbaz Nadeem 4/41). \nIndia A 1st Innings: 447. \nIndia A won by an innings and 26 runs.

They lie fifth in the 10-team South American group, just below Peru on goal difference. \n\u201cNow it\u2019s gotten complicated,\u201d coach Jorge Sampaoli said after they drew their last match at home to Venezuela. \u201cIt\u2019s tight.\u201d File image of Jorge Sampaoli. AP \nThe top four teams qualify automatically for next year\u2019s tournament in Russia and the fifth-placed side play New Zealand in a two-legged playoff for an additional spot. \nFormer Chile and Seville coach Sampaoli took over four months ago with the sole task of getting what is arguably the world\u2019s greatest collection of attacking talent to Russia. \nThe problem, however, has been how to get the best out of it. \nArgentina have so many options in midfield and up front that players such as Sergio Aguero, Gonzalo Higuain and Javier Pastore are not automatic choices. \nHiguain, who played in nine of Argentina\u2019s first 13 qualifiers, was dropped from the last two squads and Aguero, who will miss the next two games through injury, has started five of the last six on the bench. \nThe players chosen have struggled to reproduce their club form at international level, with Lionel Messi and Paulo Dybala among those who have been less than influential when wearing the blue and white stripes. \nArgentina lost at home to Ecuador and Paraguay and failed to beat Venezuela, a team with just one win from 16 games, both home and away. They have scored only 16 goals, with only Bolivia managing fewer. \nAnother problem has come off the field where turmoil within the Argentine Football Association has meant three coaches have led the team since the qualifying campaign began two years ago. \nThe constant chopping and changing has prevented the side from finding a settled style of play. \nSampaoli, who took over in June, has the credentials, having led Chile to the Copa America title in 2015. \nBut his selections have also been inconsistent and Argentina have used 48 different players since the 2016 Copa America. \nSampaoli this week recalled Fernando Gago after a two-year absence and called up two players who have never started a competitive international. \nIn a bid to increase the pressure on their opponents the home side have moved the game to Boca Juniors\u2019 tightly-packed Bombonera stadium from their traditional home at River Plate\u2019s Monumental. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 06:22 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 06:22 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fernando gago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paulo dybala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jorge sampaoli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergio aguero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gonzalo higuain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "higuain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sampaoli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "javier pastore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lionel messi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aguero", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fifa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boca juniors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sports reuters oct", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "argentine football association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ecuador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bombonera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paraguay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bolivia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "copa america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "river plate", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:04:01.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c26d8e9f9bb0f35690923c5f4c058c3a28ce525", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWE.Wf.XKNu.26HoH157lkHSzVknPLMH82BkpkZqgdPjSsN1KWbqIr_LgsYLnNl..EnZfcg84DHz0oVkv7DisgOdETNvPAk6RvFrNBvqFiU2CgBsTqUjXQPhf3IJGgvBrKYoO8LkJnj__qFIlSo8WD3CVGkXm.L_7vsiq4M1j5fLL0-", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Indian sports minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore announces launch of national school, college games", "title_full": "Indian sports minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore announces launch of national school, college games", "published": "2017-10-03T15:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Rajyavardhan-Singh-Rathore_opt-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 39, "comments": 0, "shares": 39}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c26d8e9f9bb0f35690923c5f4c058c3a28ce525", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWE.Wf.XKNu.26HoH157lkHSzVknPLMH82BkpkZqgdPjSsN1KWbqIr_LgsYLnNl..EnZfcg84DHz0oVkv7DisgOdETNvPAk6RvFrNBvqFiU2CgBsTqUjXQPhf3IJGgvBrKYoO8LkJnj__qFIlSo8WD3CVGkXm.L_7vsiq4M1j5fLL0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PTI", "published": "2017-10-03T15:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Indian sports minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore announces launch of national school, college games", "text": "Indian sports minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore announces launch of national school, college games Sports PTI Oct, 03 2017 18:21:09 IST Tweet \nNew Delhi: Sports minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore on Tuesday announced the launch of national school and college games in December and January next year respectively to tap talent from every nook and corner of the country. \nDelivering his speech at a felicitation function of the Indian football team for the U-17 World Cup, beginning on Friday, Rathore said the youth of this country will have to be provided platforms to show their talent. \n\"The way we looked at sports will have to be changed. All the stakeholders will have to be involved in taking Indian sports to a new level. The government will provide the platform for the young people to take up sports,\" he said.

Image courtesy: Twitter @Ra_THORe \n\"In this regard, the government has decided to start for the first time the Khelo India National School Games in December 2017 and Khelo India National College Games in January 2018. These will be annual events. This we are doing to tap talent at the school and college levels. Without doing this we will not be able to nurture talent,\" Rathore added. \nHe said the corporate houses will be involved in this endeavour and the Games will be telecast live. \nElaborating the plan of the government, the sports minister said, \"We want to hold these Games in a big way like the Asian Games or Pan American Games. From these Games, 1000 children will be selected and be given Rs 5 lakh for eight years for their training and each year 1000 children more will be added. \n\"These days miracles do not happen in sports. We have to find out young talents and nurture them so that miracles happen.\" \nRathore, who won an individual silver medal in men's double trap shooting event at the 2004 Athens Olympics, asked the India U-17 football team members to play to win in the upcoming tournament. \n\"You, the U-17 players can inspire the nation with what you do on the football field. The game you play now will be etched in memory. You (India) may have qualified automatically as the hosts, but that should not deter you from surprising the other teams by winning matches. \n\"You should play each game as the last match of your life and should never give up. Every moment counts and you are there to win and you will play the games to win. Once you step into the field you should be aggressive and play to win,\" said Rathore while speaking to the Indian players, who listened with rapt attention. \nThe Minister advised the players to motivate themselves by remembering the hardships they had to endure before reaching this stage. \n\"When you enter the field, you should remember the most ridiculous things people may have said about you in the past, all the pains you have suffered in you efforts to reach up to here and all the late night dribbles with the ball that has become a part of your life,\" said Rathore. \n\"You are not playing for Manipur or Bengal or Goa but you are playing for India. I wish you all the very best in the FIFA U-17 World Cup.\" \nAll the 21 players were introduced to the sports minister and captain Amarjit Singh Kiyam received a momento on behalf of the team. \nLater speaking to the reporters, Rathore said Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium was handed over to the Local Organising Committee according to schedule and the FIFA was happy with the facilities. \n\"FIFA is the organiser of this tournament and we have handed over the JLN to the LoC much earlier. FIFA is happy with the preparation of the facility,\" he said. \nHe also said that ticket sales of the U-17 World Cup was satisfactory. \n\"The ticket sales in all the six venues was very good. We actually held on the sale of the tickets so that we can reserve some for the children. We want children to watch the matches in large numbers,\" said Rathore. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 06:21 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 06:21 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rajyavardhan singh rathore", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rathore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amarjit singh kiyam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "khelo india national school games", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khelo india national college games", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "local organising committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jawaharlal nehru stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bengal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manipur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:04:02.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "132cdcd098c2638336bcfe1ee8774328bfecfacd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEIFOo25Xx2IR2dKaSApiNkpNEyKnPUygttPpUImPDbzglhxwiLg5ffrOvSiWbpeNEx6Bo2s2CU5AjmSTJZersJn79pHcwfH2.cMR1xrueLJouCnaoMY0nkT2KhGqO8.Z_9T45YSQxD.Dw2gSReXbZDMJE96PjYV_k", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Money laundering case: Vijay Mallya arrested on supplementary affidavit filed by ED, gets bail", "title_full": "Money laundering case: Vijay Mallya arrested on supplementary affidavit filed by ED, gets bail", "published": "2017-10-03T15:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Vijay-Mallya1_SOCIAL.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 109, "comments": 0, "shares": 109}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "132cdcd098c2638336bcfe1ee8774328bfecfacd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEIFOo25Xx2IR2dKaSApiNkpNEyKnPUygttPpUImPDbzglhxwiLg5ffrOvSiWbpeNEx6Bo2s2CU5AjmSTJZersJn79pHcwfH2.cMR1xrueLJouCnaoMY0nkT2KhGqO8.Z_9T45YSQxD.Dw2gSReXbZDMJE96PjYV_k", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FP Staff", "published": "2017-10-03T15:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Money laundering case: Vijay Mallya arrested on supplementary affidavit filed by ED, gets bail", "text": "Tweet \nBeleaguered liquor baron Vijay Mallya has been arrested after the Enforcement Directorate a filed a supplementary affidavit in the ongoing money laundering case.

The official had claimed that the agencies have been able to establish the links between the shell companies and bank accounts in the seven countries. \nThe agencies were hoping that the latest evidence once submitted before the London court where the final extradition hearing will take place in December, they will have an airtight case. At present, in front of the UK court, the agencies have presented the charges in the nearly Rs 900 crore IDBI Bank loan default case. \nThe first hearing in the case took place on June 13, when December 4 had been pencilled in as a tentative final hearing date. \nIf the Chief Magistrate rules in favour of extradition at the end of the trial, the UK home secretary must order Mallya\u2019s extradition within two months of the appropriate day. \nHowever, the case can go through a series of appeals before arriving at a conclusion. \nIndia and the UK have an Extradition Treaty, signed in 1992 and in force since November 1993, under which recently a Bangladeshi national wanted in the UK on murder charges was to be extradited from India. \n(With inputs from PTI) \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 06:18 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 06:18 pm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vijay mallya", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mallya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emma louise arbuthnot", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "enforcement directorate", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "westminster magistrates' court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingfisher airlines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central bureau of investigation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metropolitan police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idbi bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "scotland yard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:04:08.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a18b799dd4de7332621486947e2bcfe2c91cc63a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEJS2jbbCGw4V11LqnSidXtnMWYwsYqYztXVx_8i4nCkT3_2wmEv21elUyNowNTesTDA_0BHIu159wW4KRpUEr3XPGxRAJgPCwcTAzND_YNcbOkstt3MgHOUM20KZZt7OYzL8N9bnLtG0-", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Darjeeling unrest: GJM leader Binay Tamang asks BJP to clear stand on Gorkhaland", "title_full": "Darjeeling unrest: GJM leader Binay Tamang asks BJP to clear stand on Gorkhaland", "published": "2017-10-03T15:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Darjeeling-protest_PTI1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 46, "comments": 0, "shares": 46}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a18b799dd4de7332621486947e2bcfe2c91cc63a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEJS2jbbCGw4V11LqnSidXtnMWYwsYqYztXVx_8i4nCkT3_2wmEv21elUyNowNTesTDA_0BHIu159wW4KRpUEr3XPGxRAJgPCwcTAzND_YNcbOkstt3MgHOUM20KZZt7OYzL8N9bnLtG0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PTI", "published": "2017-10-03T15:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Darjeeling unrest: GJM leader Binay Tamang asks BJP to clear stand on Gorkhaland", "text": "Darjeeling unrest: GJM leader Binay Tamang asks BJP to clear stand on Gorkhaland India PTI Oct, 03 2017 18:16:43 IST Tweet \nDarjeeling: Chairman of the Board of Administrators for Darjeeling hills and expelled GJM leader Binay Tamang has asked Union minister SS Ahluwalia and West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh to clear their stand on the Gorkhaland issue before setting foot in the hills.

Gun violence is a public health crisis that has claimed thousands of innocent lives and the Congress must do everything it can to address it, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal said, hours after a gunman opened fire on a large crowd during a music concert in Las Vegas. \nThe American people are tired of being outraged, sending thoughts and prayers, seeing men, women and children die because the gun lobby does put profit over people, Jayapal said during her speech on the floor of the US House of Representatives on Monday. \n\"That is not what our founders intended by the 'right to bear arms',\" the first-time lawmaker from Washington State said, as she joined several of her Congressional colleagues calling for changes in gun control laws. Representational image. AP \n\"With rights come responsibilities: the responsibility to stop gun sales loopholes, to enact protections that make sure our children and those with severe mental illnesses don't have access to guns, to address funding for mental health, and to oppose any efforts to make it easier to purchase silencers,\" Jayapal said. \nThe first ever Indian-American women elected to the House of Representatives said 87 per cent of gun owners and 74 per cent of NRA members support those commonsense solutions like criminal background checks. \n\"I have a plea for gun owners across this country: Urge the non-resident aliens (NRA) to represent your views. Show them that you mean business by speaking out or even terminating your NRA membership. Show that you care about your fellow Americans,\" she said. \nShe added: \"Act now. Enough is enough.\" The Las Vegas shooting on Sunday night, in which at least 59 people were killed and more than 500 wounded, has rekindled the debate on gun control laws in the US. \nNearly 12,000 Americans have been killed by guns in 273 mass shootings in 2017 so far \u2014 one incident for each day, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit corporation that tracks gun-related violence in the US. \nOn an average, more than 90 Americans lose their lives to gun violence every day, a daily toll of heartbreak and tragedy in communities across the US. Other Indian-American Congressmen too joined Jayapal in condemning the incident. \nNo community should have to fear going to the movies, a concert, or dropping their child off at school, said Ami Bera, the three-term Congressman from California. \n\"In the wake of this tragedy, I hope we'll all be able to take the time to look for the helpers and that each of us, in our own way, will seek to help our nation heal, move forward, and work to prevent similar tragedies,\" Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat Congressman from 8th district Illinois, said. \n\"We must end this senseless violence,\" said Congressman Ro Khanna, Democrat Congressman from 17th district California. In a statement, UNITED SIKHS condemned the \"senseless act\" of terror. \nIts volunteers have teamed with Gurdwaras, where shelter, hot meals (langar) and other assistance is being offered to all who may need it. Sikh taxi drivers are volunteering to drive people to their destinations safely, it said. \n 07  07 pm Tags : #Gun control #Las vegas shooting #Mandalay bay #Newstracker #Route91 festival #Stephen paddock #Us gun control law Also See", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "raja krishnamoorthi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jayapal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ami bera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pramila jayapal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ro khanna", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congressional", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united sikhs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "8th district illinois", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:04:13.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce7150432e148e3ebb7a89f9dfa3c6f69d90281c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWE.Wf.XKNu.27UrT24uEyFb3INlaLwgV4Bo0RXf.mO6VBPFGBxye5ezxppoZnHHqMJI19GhqpNB6ekLGRj8pr3CETt4NKzJgpc7WgOGywozHh4b_TQfLT8kqlaHITxUVPWmPYjBP5BfC9eLFWxC.8UjhLmkTZnpVhk3j9Cmxc8M3U-", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://news.google.co.in/news?pz=1&cf=all&ned=in&hl=en&topic=s&output=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sport - Google News", "title": "FIFA U-17 World Cup 2017: Group F shapes up to be tightest with fancied England, Mexico, Chile and Iraq - Firstpost", "title_full": "FIFA U-17 World Cup 2017: Group F shapes up to be tightest with fancied England, Mexico, Chile and Iraq - Firstpost", "published": "2017-10-03T14:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1280x720-Kolkata.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 29, "comments": 0, "shares": 29}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce7150432e148e3ebb7a89f9dfa3c6f69d90281c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWE.Wf.XKNu.27UrT24uEyFb3INlaLwgV4Bo0RXf.mO6VBPFGBxye5ezxppoZnHHqMJI19GhqpNB6ekLGRj8pr3CETt4NKzJgpc7WgOGywozHh4b_TQfLT8kqlaHITxUVPWmPYjBP5BfC9eLFWxC.8UjhLmkTZnpVhk3j9Cmxc8M3U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T14:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "FIFA U-17 World Cup 2017: Group F shapes up to be tightest with fancied England, Mexico, Chile and Iraq - Firstpost", "text": "Tweet \nThe 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup is about to get underway and with all nations in the final stages of their preparation, the Group F, dubbed as the \u2018Group of Death\u2019 by pundits, throws up some intriguing contests. The fact that only top two teams from every group and four of the best third-placed teams will find their place in the knock-outs only adds interest to a group full of heavyweights. \nChile \nChile\u2019s youth team has experienced an upward curve over the last few years, keeping in tune with the attacking riches of their senior squad, and finished second in the extremely competitive previous edition of the South American U-17 Championships. \nChile, under the careful eyes of Argentina-born Hernan Caputto, has slowly but steadily flourished as they have shown a knack for grinding out results with a meagre lead. Although they have been guilty of complacency at the back occasionally, as during their 5-0 loss to Brazil in the finals of the CONMEBOL U-17 Championship, Chile are the dark horses of this year\u2019s World Cup. \nPrevious U-17 World Cup record: Chile had qualified for the last World Cup as the host nation and made it past the group stage, but were beaten by Mexico in the Round of 16. The South American nation\u2019s best performance in this competition came back in 1993 when they finished third. \nKey Players: Gaston Zuniga, Chile\u2019s right-back embodies a modern fullback and his ball-playing abilities are the perfect complement to his aggressive tackling. With match-winning goals adding to his skill set, the 17-year-old O\u2019Higgins FC U-19 player could be the breakout star of the tournament. \nEngland \nThe European heavyweights and the U-17 European Championship runners-up are one of the prime contenders for the World Cup. A squad packed with creativity and style, England can play a plethora of formations and as they showcased in the recently concluded U-17 Euros, they have what it takes to go the distance. Although Steve Cooper\u2019s side fell to Spain on penalties in the finals, only a few could argue the sheer class oozing out of the English youngsters. \nIn a stark contrast to the England senior squad, who have gained a notorious reputation of struggling on the continent\u2019s and the world\u2019s biggest stage, the U-17 side has the temperament to backup it mettle. \nPrevious U-17 World Cup record: England have never made it past the quarter-finals in this competition, having qualified for only three previous editions. The last time they qualified for the World Cup in 2013, they were knocked out after the group stage, as they failed to win even a single game. \nKey Players: Jadon Sancho, the 17-year-old winger, who became the first Englishman to ply his trade at Borussia Dortmund, is the crown jewel of the English team. His attacking prowess is well-documented, as is his natural goal-scoring ability. \nWhile Sancho (should Borussia Dortmund release him for international duty) will act as the fulcrum for the U-17 side\u2019s bid to follow up their U-20 national counterparts in winning the World Cup, the presence of Liverpool\u2019s Rhian Breswter and Chelsea\u2019s Callum Hudson-Odoi, both of whom are among the goals, ensures England have a multi-faceted approach to their attack. \nThe likes of Angel Gomes and Tashan Oakley-Boothe, who are already on the fringes of the senior squads of their respective clubs, provide England with a well-settled, dynamic midfield while the 16-year-old Chelsea defender Jonathan Panzo has already received rave reviews due to his assured performances at the heart of the defence. \nIraq \nIraq are arguably the strongest among the Asian nations participating in the FIFA U-17 World Cup. The current U-16 AFC Champions, crowned last year, have been in tremendous form heading into the World Cup, but the draw has been pretty harsh to them. \nQualifying for the knock-outs will prove to be a tough task for Ali Hadi\u2019s boys, as they will face far more accomplished nations in Chile, England and Mexico. In a war-torn nation, football has been one of the brighter spots for the younger generation, with the current crop of U-17 players boasting of spectacular talent all across the pitch. \nPrevious U-17 World Cup record: Iraq are still looking for their maiden win in the World Cup, as they lost all their group matches the last time they qualified in 2013. \nKey Players: Mohammed Dawood, the 16-year-old eclectic centre forward, is Iraq\u2019s best player and his partnership with midfielders Mohammed Ridha and Moamel Kareem will be crucial to Iraq\u2019s chances of qualification. With extensive experience at this level, Iraq\u2019s simplistic tactical approach and composure in the final third are their strong suits. \nMexico \nMexico, the current CONCACAF champions, are among the most accomplished nations at the U-17 FIFA World Cup, having won twice in their twelve appearances \u2014 their most recent triumph coming in 2011. Mario Arteaga, who has been at the helm since 2014 has a well-oiled side ready to conquer on the ultimate stage. \nMexico\u2019s consistency at the youth level is astounding, as they secured three consecutive CONCACAF championships in the last three editions. The El Tri juniors were the top seeded side during the draw and deservingly so \u2014 their possession-based playing style and high pressing has drawn applause and reverence from many stalwarts of the game. \nPrevious U-17 World Cup record: Mexico\u2019s previous three outings in the last three editions of the World Cup resulted in them finishing as the champions, the runners-up and in the fourth place. Since 1999, Mexico have always made it to the knock-outs, whenever they have qualified for the World Cup. \nKey Players: Mexico rest their hopes on Diego Lainez, the 17-year-old Club America attacking midfielder, whose tactical awareness is far beyond his age. Lainez is yet to play alongside the U-17 CONCACAF top scorer Roberto de La Rosa, but Artaega is confident that the combination of two of his star players will only enhance Mexico\u2019s proficiency in front of the goal. \nAll four teams stand a chance to qualify for the knock-outs, with no clear favorites in Group F yet. England and Mexico are likely to be the trailblazers but the pragmatic approaches of Iraq and Chile could help them spring a surprise on the European and North-American heavyweights and punch their tickets for the Round of 16 of the FIFA U-17 World Cup. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 05:11 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 05:11 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gaston zuniga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roberto de la rosa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tashan oakley-boothe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diego lainez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve cooper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sancho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan panzo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rhian breswter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angel gomes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "artaega", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jadon sancho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mario arteaga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hernan caputto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed ridha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moamel kareem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lainez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "callum hudson-odoi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed dawood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ali hadi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fifa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "o\u2019higgins fc u-19", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liverpool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "borussia dortmund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "club america", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico  mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile  chile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq  iraq", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:19:33.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e2e8373f01c86d94aeca8f61ff5862145bdccec9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWE.Wf.XKNu.27YOAVqG1vzTWjEVFzWkFLdKyvGpCjTfYTgl_PtMcuC4Elx9lwLT.ZzlotqAH7KFyVhGpeTDvSmDR7GKHmR7iONcXiENwC_9zfpFaBQ9DSDapg_qThkrPnuOLx5GtB80DkEBU11Ei4Olg--", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/firstpost/xfJh", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Premier League: Zlatan Ibrahimovic mustn\u2019t rush Manchester United return, says surgeon", "title_full": "Premier League: Zlatan Ibrahimovic mustn\u2019t rush Manchester United return, says surgeon", "published": "2017-10-03T16:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Zlatan-Ibrahimovic-Manchester-United-Getty-social.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e2e8373f01c86d94aeca8f61ff5862145bdccec9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWE.Wf.XKNu.27YOAVqG1vzTWjEVFzWkFLdKyvGpCjTfYTgl_PtMcuC4Elx9lwLT.ZzlotqAH7KFyVhGpeTDvSmDR7GKHmR7iONcXiENwC_9zfpFaBQ9DSDapg_qThkrPnuOLx5GtB80DkEBU11Ei4Olg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2017-10-03T16:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Premier League: Zlatan Ibrahimovic mustn\u2019t rush Manchester United return, says surgeon", "text": "Premier League: Zlatan Ibrahimovic mustn't rush Manchester United return, says surgeon Sports Reuters Oct, 03 2017 18:52:52 IST \nZlatan Ibrahimovic has been warned not to rush his Manchester United return by surgeon Freddie Fu Ho-keung, who operated on his knee in May.

The cost of profligacy at this stage would not only be high, it will derail much of the good work that the NDA and the RBI have done. \nHowever, slow nursing of the economy back to health is possible only if it has not been irrevocably grounded, as former finance minister Yashwant Sinha has alleged. Policymaking cannot be a theoretical exercise. It involves real people who are in real stress due to structural revamp and shoddiness on the implementation side. \nFile photo of Yashwant Sinha and Jayant Sinha. AFP \nIf too many sectors become traumatic, relaxation of fiscal deficit target might become a necessity. Therefore, fiscal discipline can be maintained only if macroeconomic fundamentals are strong and the economy is resilient enough to withstand a few more quarters of sluggish growth. In short, does Modi have time enough in his hands to normalize demand without taking a shortcut? \nCritics are saying he has run out of time. They are painting a grim picture. They allege that Modi is tipping the economy over a precipice, and accuse him of gross economic mismanagement. Some have predicted that he will pay a heavy political price for creating such a mess. \nIf economic theories are postulations minus accountability, any number of conclusions might be drawn, limited only by the theorist's political inclination and imagination. Has the economy really been grounded, as former finance minister and the critics are suggesting? Are we hurtling towards Armageddon? \nIn a rebuttal to Yashwant, civil aviation minister Jayant Sinha has pointed out that the temporary disruption is the collateral effect of deep-seated, fundamental reforms such as GST, focus on digital payments, formalisation of economy through demonetisation, rules-based, transparent policymaking across ministries, bankruptcy code to address bank NPAs, direct benefit transfer through Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile (JAM), streamlined FDI regime, massive infrastructural push, electrification of villages, increased air connectivity, effort to create innovation and entrepreneurship culture, etc., \nHe argues that these 'third-generation reforms' will take some time to bear fruit but once they do, a \"robust economy\" will be created where growth will remain sustainable. \nIn his words , \"These structural reforms are not just desirable, they are necessary to create a \u2018New India\u2019 and provide good jobs for our billion-strong workforce. The new economy that is being created will be much more transparent, globally cost-competitive, and innovation driven. Importantly, the new economy will also be much more equitable thereby enabling all Indians to lead better lives.\" \nIn so far as the need for structural reforms is concerned, the civil aviation minister has a compelling case. Indian economy needed to be rescued from the quagmire of corruption and populism of UPA years and no action that can qualify as 'reform' is without costs. It is also specious to argue that Modi has \"destroyed the economy through disruptive steps\" and simultaneously claim that the prime minister is 'all jumla' and no action. \nAnnat Jain aptly points out in Hindustan Times that \"structural reform is thankless: costs are borne upfront, and rewards come later\u2026 For years, it was the very absence of these structural reforms that armchair foxes have bemoaned. Now that the reforms are occurring, the foxes are coming out of the forest, and unwilling to pay the price, claim that these are ill-timed, ill-conceived or ill-executed.\" \nThe dispute, then, isn't that structural reforms are unnecessary. It is whether the economy is strong enough to withstand the collateral damage. The trouble with Sinha junior's argument is that instead of addressing and refuting his father's core contention \u2014 that economy is in dire straits \u2014 he paints a picture of future possibilities. Promise of a rosy future cannot mitigate the crisis at hand. So how deep is the crisis? \nAccording to Sinha senior, the former finance minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime, the Indian economy is in doldrums. He makes a series of observation in his much-quoted piece published in The Indian Express : \"Private investment has shrunk as never before in two decades, industrial production has all but collapsed, agriculture is in distress, construction industry\u2026 is in the doldrums, the rest of the service sector is also in the slow lane, exports have dwindled, sector after sector of the economy is in distress.\" \nHow sound are Yashwant's claims? To begin, let us look at export figures. Yashwant claims that \"exports have dwindled\". He didn't cite any data, so it is unclear which figure he based his argument on. The reality is that exports have risen for 12 straight months, and exporters have posted a growth of 10.29 percent to $23.81 billion during August 2017 on a year-on-year basis, according to data from ministry of commerce and industry. \nA report published in Hindustan Times , quoting a ministry statement, states: \"Exports during August, 2017 have shown growth of 10.29 percent in dollar terms valued at $23,818.83 million as compared to $21,597.09 million during August, 2016,\u201d backed by increase in exports of major commodity groups such as \"engineering goods (19.53 percent), petroleum products (36.56 percent), organic and inorganic chemicals (32.41 percent), drugs and pharmaceuticals (4.21 percent), and RMG of all textiles (0.56 percent).\" \nYashwant says that \"industrial production has all but collapsed\", but a turnaround is already visible in some indices. Automobile sales, for instance, have shot up. Vehicle sales have posted double digit growth in passenger, commercial and two-wheeler categories. Four of India's top six automakers, reports The Financial Express , have registered \"massive increase in domestic sales in September\" and this trend is expected to continue. Maruti, India\u2019s largest passenger car manufacturer, reported an increase of 10.3 percent in its domestic sales last month compared to the same period last year, top passenger car exporter Hyundai Motor India reported a growth of 17.4 percent, Tata Motors recorded sales of 17,286 units \u2014 a growth of 18 percent over September 2016 \u2014 and Honda Cars posted a growth of 21 percent, according to the newspaper. \nCiting data from Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), news agency PTI reports that total two-wheeler sales in August grew 14.69 percent to 18,91,062 units compared to 16,48,871 units in the same period last year. It quotes SIAM DG Vishnu Mathur, as saying: \"The growth in the two-wheeler segment is a reflection of the rural market coming back to normalcy with the impact of demonetisation wearing off.\" \nThere has been a 15.63 percent rise in domestic air passenger traffic in August over the same period last year, up from 12.43 percent growth registered the month previous. Overall, the picture isn't quite compatible with the image of Armageddon that Sinha and some critics have painted. \nAccording to Sinha, \"for quarter after quarter, the growth rate of the economy has been declining until it reached the low of 5.7 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal, the lowest in three years. The spokespersons of the government say that demonetisation is not responsible for this deceleration. They are right. The deceleration had started much earlier. Demonetisation only added fuel to fire.\" \nThere is some truth in his statement that demonetisation halted the economy and subjected it to a shock therapy. As this writer has argued previously , Modi prioritised transparency and formalisation over pursuit of growth. This was a conscious decision arising out of a conviction that the electorate wants him to clean up the act instead of maintaining status quo. He may well be wrong in his choice and mistaken in his conviction (and consequently will pay a political price, sooner or later), but at least Modi acted where most prefer to sit on fence. \nThe point about \"quarter after quarter\" of declining growth is an exaggeration. In the globally interconnected markets, to assume that India is insured from global upturns and downturns is impractical. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, writes in Business Standard , \"The present downturn in the Indian economy has come at a time when global growth is recovering. If global growth continues to improve and the domestic growth continues to falter, that would be a serious concern.\" \nIndia's GDP witnessed a growth for seven straight quarters since Modi came into power, and has declined in the last five quarters with the sharpest downturn coinciding with demonetisation. Allowing for the downturn introduced by currency ban, the decline in growth matches the trend in emerging markets. China has slowed down, and so has Indonesia and, as Omkar Goswami points out in The Economic Times , it may have something to do with the \"disappearance of oil bonanza.\" \nThe alarmism being peddled from some quarters seems to have a political motive which Modi critics have happily bought into. In matters of economy, however, stitching of narratives is trickier because these are subjected to data verification. India's macroeconomic stability is sound and seems strong enough to resist demonetisation and shoddy GST aftershocks. \nSajjid Z Chinoy, chief India economist at JP Morgan, had expanded in July how India's macroeconomic stability sits at odds with near-term slowdown. The writer gave high marks to the Modi government for its structural reforms in the fields of Aadhaar, bankruptcy law, GST and codification of the new monetary policy framework and had noted how India has dramatically become a \"safe haven among emerging markets\" by successfully solving a mini balance of payments crisis in 2013. \nHe also praised the government for \"dramatic reduction in inflation\" and wrote in his piece for Livemint that these reforms will \"help facilitate the much-needed 'creative destruction' of capital, and the new monetary framework will ensure that inflation never again gets entrenched at 10 percent. These are not small gains. This, then, is the first narrative governing the Indian economy: heightened macroeconomic stability combined with stronger medium-term growth prospects.\" \nChinoy also sounded a note of caution, however, on the 'twin balance sheet problem' that could create substantial \"headwinds\" for the economy. \nThe truth about economy, as always, lies somewhere in the middle. Neither has it \"crash landed\", \"tipped over the precipice\", nor is it soaring. Modi government has already ensured macroeconomic stability through some structural changes, now is the time to work hard and maintain fiscal discipline, which is already under pressure from reckless waiving of farm loans. \nAs for Yashwant's prediction, let me leave the reader with a prediction from Swaminathan Aiyar in The Times of India , where he urges finance minister Arun Jaitley not to deviate from the path of prudence. \n\"The economy has been hit by short-term shocks imposed by demonetisation and the launch of GST. But the shocks will gradually fade away, resulting in a bounce-back of growth in 2018. There is no evidence of a coming hard landing, as predicted by Yashwant Sinha.\" \nNarrative peddlers should take a much-needed break. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 06:49 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 06:51 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omkar goswami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yashwant sinha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vishnu mathur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sajjid z chinoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arun jaitley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "annat jain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swaminathan aiyar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jayant sinha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vk vijayakumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jan dhan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sinha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atal bihari vajpayee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yashwant", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hindustan times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geojit financial services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "upa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "financial express", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyundai motor india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "society of indian automobile manufacturers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "economic times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tata motors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honda cars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jp morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maruti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "business standard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "aadhaar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:32:09.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "78f907eb171b105c837427f583c6d52ca1a821ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWELQtGPOA1oUfMhPM7YLKwRmkb47W9Tad1LQUnK.8lT5n.5hgKOtV6itoc702LAvE6M4r5xIsve53Yuq_9fgrja.T7c1IHj9p4Rw9Hg4Tq_kwF4bIfURhYRQyZXEQhJudOZgNxDpUwIWn6XxVPOaJgqnGYYCGzE9S7", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/firstpost/xfJh", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Las Vegas massacre: Investigators search for motive behind deadliest mass shootout in US history", "title_full": "Las Vegas massacre: Investigators search for motive behind deadliest mass shootout in US history", "published": "2017-10-03T16:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Las-Vegas-shoot-AP.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "78f907eb171b105c837427f583c6d52ca1a821ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWELQtGPOA1oUfMhPM7YLKwRmkb47W9Tad1LQUnK.8lT5n.5hgKOtV6itoc702LAvE6M4r5xIsve53Yuq_9fgrja.T7c1IHj9p4Rw9Hg4Tq_kwF4bIfURhYRQyZXEQhJudOZgNxDpUwIWn6XxVPOaJgqnGYYCGzE9S7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AFP", "published": "2017-10-03T16:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Las Vegas massacre: Investigators search for motive behind deadliest mass shootout in US history", "text": "Las Vegas massacre: Investigators search for motive behind deadliest mass shootout in US history World AFP Oct, 03 2017 18:50:24 IST Tweet \nLas Vegas: Investigators worked feverishly on Tuesday to find out why a retired accountant gunned down at least 59 people and wounded over 500 others at an open-air concert in Las Vegas, raking the crowd with bullets from a 32nd-floor hotel room packed with weapons. A police personnel during the shooting attack in Las Vegas. AP \nAs America grappled with the deadliest mass shooting in its history, officials reacted cautiously to an Islamic State group claim that Stephen Craig Paddock, 64, had carried out Sunday night's massacre on behalf of the jihadist group. \nPolice said Paddock, who had no criminal record, smashed windows in his hotel room shortly after 10 pm on Sunday and trained bursts of automatic weapons fire on thousands of people attending a country music concert down below. \nIn footage of the massacre broadcast on CNN , the sustained rattle of gunfire is heard as people scream and bolt for cover with little idea of where the shots were coming from. \n\"We saw bodies down. We didn't know if they had fallen or had been shot,\" said Ralph Rodriguez, an IT consultant from Pomona Valley near Los Angeles, who was at the concert with a group of friends. \n\"People started grabbing their loved-ones and just strangers, and trying to help them get out of the way,\" he said. \nIn a statement on online, Islamic State claimed Paddock was one of its \"soldiers\" but the FBI said it had found no such connection so far with the local sheriff describing him as a lone \"psychopath.\" \nSheriff Joseph Lombardo said Paddock fired through the door of his hotel room and hit a security guard in the leg. \nBut when a SWAT team stormed the room where Paddock had been staying since 28 September, they found he had killed himself. \nInside the room were 23 firearms including automatic weapons, he said. \nInvestigators also found another 19 firearms along with explosives and several thousand rounds of ammo at Paddock's house in Mesquite, Nevada, some 130 km away. \nLombardo said they had discovered several pounds of an explosive called tannerite at the house as well as ammonium nitrate, a type of fertiliser, in his car. \nHe said the death toll had risen to 59, with another 527 people wounded. \nBut the gunman's motive remains unclear. \n\"We're hunting down and tracing every single clue that we can get on his background,\" the sheriff said at a late-night briefing. \nSo far, investigators had found no manifesto or anything else to explain Paddock's actions, he said. \n\"This individual is a lone wolf and I don't know how it could have been prevented,\" he said earlier. \n\"I can't get into the mind of a psychopath at this point.\" \nAs the investigation continued, details started to emerge in the media about some of the victims \u2014 a kindergarten teacher from California who married her childhood sweetheart; a Tennessee nurse; a high school secretary from New Mexico and a cheerleader, also from California. \nMonday night, there were vigils of solidarity with the dead and the wounded. \nThe Empire State Building went dark, as did the Eiffel Tower \u2014 and much of the Las Vegas strip itself. \nPresident Donald Trump denounced what he called \"an act of pure evil\" and said he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday. \nBut the White House pushed back at calls to reopen the US debate on tighter gun controls. \n\"A motive is yet to be determined and it would be premature for us to discuss policy when we don't fully know all of the facts or what took place last night,\" Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. \nLombardo said Paddock had apparently used some kind of hammer to smash the window of his hotel room before opening fire on the crowd of some 22,000 people. \nIslamic State, which provided no evidence for its claims, described him as a \"soldier of the caliphate\" saying he converted to Islam several months ago and went by the name Abu Abdel Bar al-Amriki \u2014 \"The American.\" \nBut the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had found no such link so far. \"We have determined to this point no connection with an international terrorist group,\" FBI special agent Aaron Rouse said. \nCIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said the intelligence community was aware of the claim but advised \"caution on jumping to conclusions before the facts are in.\" \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 06:48 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 06:50 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wor", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ralph rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lombardo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan liu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen craig paddock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron rouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paddock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph lombardo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu abdel bar al-amriki", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal bureau of investigation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pomona valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mesquite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eiffel tower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paddock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:32:16.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5380c964313fdbcdf24fee914f864001c3ea8a33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEnx2glIryRGAdzOJ_UhpWGeLNc5eA.lTarBpyUAa814JbrYLyr6KUfDZBstBifzHa2Q5i4CJ1t8_vgJfOndzSBpj3adQzPbr6bVyH8qCGm2I2EJXLQtMrfEqOi.dyzhD5R9tjlnPGEvQ-", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/firstpost/xfJh?utm_source=fp_footer", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "OnePlus launches its exclusive JCC-designed \u2018Callection\u2019 in India", "title_full": "OnePlus launches its exclusive JCC-designed \u2018Callection\u2019 in India", "published": "2017-10-03T16:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/OnePlus-JCC-T-Shirt-380px.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5380c964313fdbcdf24fee914f864001c3ea8a33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEnx2glIryRGAdzOJ_UhpWGeLNc5eA.lTarBpyUAa814JbrYLyr6KUfDZBstBifzHa2Q5i4CJ1t8_vgJfOndzSBpj3adQzPbr6bVyH8qCGm2I2EJXLQtMrfEqOi.dyzhD5R9tjlnPGEvQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "tech2 News Staff", "published": "2017-10-03T16:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "OnePlus launches its exclusive JCC-designed \u2018Callection\u2019 in India", "text": "The Shenzhen-based smartphone maker has announced that it launching \u2018the exclusive line of products titled, \u201cCallection\u201d in the Indian market.

File image of Aung San Suu Kyi. AP \nThe 'Freedom of Oxford' had been granted to the de facto leader of Myanmar in 1997 for her \"long struggle for democracy\" by the Oxford City Council. \nA cross-party motion was unanimously passed by the council on Monday which said it was \"no longer appropriate\" for her to hold the honour. \nOxford City Council leader Bob Price supported the motion to remove her honour and confirmed it was an \"unprecedented step\" for the local authority. \nThe city council will hold a special meeting to confirm that the honour is removed on 27 November. \nSuu Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, has close links to the city of Oxford, having lived in Park Town with her family and earlier attended St Hugh's College from 1964 until 1967. \nThe city council's move comes days after her alma mater, St Hugh's, removed her portrait from the main college entrance. \nWhile the exact reasons for the portrait's removal were attributed to a new replacement, there is a wider view that the allegations of ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya Muslims fleeing their homes to Bangladesh is likely to be behind the move. \nNearly 5,00,000 people belonging to Myanmar's Rohingya minority have been displaced after violence allegedly instigated by the country's military, causing a major humanitarian crisis. \nSuu Kyi has been Myanmar's state counsellor, a position similar to prime minister, since April, 2016. \nShe spent years under house arrest as a campaigner for democracy while Myanmar was ruled by a military dictatorship. \nShe became a worldwide icon for freedom before leading her National League for Democracy to victory in open elections in November, 2015. \nThe UK government has made repeated calls for her take a more firm stance on the violence being suffered by the Rohingyas. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 05:03 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 05:03 pm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aung san suu kyi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "st hugh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suu kyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob price", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rohingya", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "st hugh's college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford city council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oxford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "myanmar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "park town", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aung san suu kyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:37:49.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5da6e83efb4381acf88ccfa6d60b6c3372e31f92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEFBiIjOhFOkl_ZyLNhS91ARYfXn17Hfhhm55Cvkp3juI19hGRgbvPFYnsjgL0SiNoGBV40GEa7gwKJMBleTp6tmvUX3KGqKX4pKVgTwBiCRaPRcdWY.mojuuLRvZqrZxvPXfZSScKJeZRob9KPHPvyaeDT.yYrpUYxW4nM9mX8d8-", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Rapper Future slammed on Twitter for promoting upcoming Las Vegas gig day after mass shooting", "title_full": "Rapper Future slammed on Twitter for promoting upcoming Las Vegas gig day after mass shooting", "published": "2017-10-03T14:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/future-rapper-1280.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5da6e83efb4381acf88ccfa6d60b6c3372e31f92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEFBiIjOhFOkl_ZyLNhS91ARYfXn17Hfhhm55Cvkp3juI19hGRgbvPFYnsjgL0SiNoGBV40GEa7gwKJMBleTp6tmvUX3KGqKX4pKVgTwBiCRaPRcdWY.mojuuLRvZqrZxvPXfZSScKJeZRob9KPHPvyaeDT.yYrpUYxW4nM9mX8d8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T14:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Rapper Future slammed on Twitter for promoting upcoming Las Vegas gig day after mass shooting", "text": "Rapper Future slammed on Twitter for promoting upcoming Las Vegas gig day after mass shooting Entertainment IANS Oct, 03 2017 17:17:52 IST \nRapper Future was slammed by social media users for promoting his Halloween concert in Las Vegas just 12 hours after the massacre in which at least 59 people died and over 500 were injured.

Reuters \nThe Detroit automaker is promising two new EVs loosely based on the Chevrolet Bolt in the next one and a half years and more than 20 electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by 2023. The company sees its entire model lineup running on electricity in the future, whether the source is a big battery or a tank full of hydrogen. \n\"We are far along in our plan to lead the way into that future world,\" product development chief Mark Reuss said Monday at a news conference at the GM technical centre north of Detroit. \nThe event was billed as a \"sneak peek\" into GM's electric future. The company also pledged to start producing hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for commercial or military use in 2020. And it promised an increase in the number of electric fast-charging stations in the US, which now total 1,100 from companies and governments, taking a shot at electric competitor Tesla Inc. by saying the system would not be \"walled off\" from electric vehicles made by other manufacturers. \nTesla has 951 fast-charging stations globally that can only be used by Tesla owners. \nThe news helped push GM's stock up 4.4 percent to a record closing price of $42.16 on Monday, besting the old high of $40.99 set on 20 December, 2013. \nThe hastily called event was short on specifics, and it came just a day before the CEO of Ford Motor Co., GM's prime competitor, was to announce its business plan that likely will include electric and autonomous vehicles as priorities. \nThe two new GM electrics in the immediate future likely will be SUVs or a sportier car designed to compete with Tesla's upcoming Model 3 sedan, Reuss said. The Model 3, which is now in the early stages of production, will go hood-to-hood with the Bolt, starting around $35,000 (excluding a $7,500 federal tax credit) with a range of over 200 miles. The Bolt starts at $37,495 excluding the credit. \nBehind Reuss and other executives were nine vehicles covered with tarps that the company said were among the 20 to be unveiled by 2023. GM pulled away from the tarps on three of them, clay models of low-slung Buick and Cadillac SUVs and a futuristic version of the Bolt that looked like half of an airport control tower glued to the top of a car body. The rest remained covered. \nThe company wouldn't allow photographs of the vehicles, and it wouldn't say if any of the vehicles it showed were the ones coming in the next 18 months. \nReuss said the new vehicles that aren't built on the Bolt platform will have GM's next-generation electric architecture, which he said will be more efficient with longer range than the Bolt's 238 miles. Through August, GM has sold 11,670 Bolts, which is less than 1 percent of GM's total US sales so far this year. \nReuss promised that the new vehicles will be profitable as people become more accustomed to the advancing technology. \"We can't just flip a switch and make the world go all-electric,\" he said.

Representational image. Courtesy: nhp.gov.in \nHailing the Right to Information Act (RTI) as a \"great success story\", Habibullah added that there were still challenges in the implementation of the 12-year-old law. \nThe absence of updated information on websites by ministries, both at the central and state level, and the maintenance of autonomy and independence of the Central Information Commission and information commissions in states were some of the challenges, the former CIC told PTI . \nUnder the RTI Act, Habibullah said, it is expected that every ministry and department under the Centre or state government should not only develop a website but also ensure that it contains a host of routine information. \nThe websites are there and a lot of information is there but that \"information is unfortunately out of date\", he said. \nEvery ministry must be \"compelled\" to disclose all this information which can be disclosed legally, he said. The government should set up an authority to supervise ministries in declaring all disclosable information on their own, the 72-year-old former bureaucrat said. \nHabibullah, who was CIC for nearly five years from 2005, said, \"Unfortunately, the law itself carries no clause for enforcement of section 4 (of the RTI Act) which talks of computerisation of all records. There is no authority to actually enforce it, the information commission can advise but cannot enforce it.\" \nAnother challenge for the RTI, he asserted, was that information commissions were expected to \"stand alone\" and supposed to be not only autonomous in their functioning but also independent in their decision making. \n\"They take no dictates from the government. Unfortunately, that (independence and autonomy) has not happened,\" he said, adding that the performance of the Central Information Commission on this front had been much better than commissions in the states. \nAsked how the government could influence commissions, Habibullah said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had himself mentioned a way out. \nThe prime minister has said the government should treat RTI as an instrument by which it can improve itself, he noted and suggested that every ministry should have a group or a team that vets the type of information that is sought. \nIt will give the government a clear indication of the areas of concern, he said. \n\"The PM put his finger on it. Unfortunately, nothing much has happened so far, (but) since the PM himself is behind it, activists, commissioners, people working within the establishment, should work together in making this a reality,\" he said. \nAsked whether RTI was being misused by some people and was, in certain cases, putting a burden on government departments, Habibullah said there was some truth in that argument. \n\"When I was the CIC, I myself would dismiss any complaints of its misuse, saying it was being misused because of the lack of information you are putting out. If you put out all the information there is no question of misuse,\" he said. \n\"The fact that we (establishment) are not taking the trouble of suo motu disclosing information which is disclosable under the act and unnecessarily applying the Official Secrets Act where it is not really applicable, we have made it more difficult for ourselves,\" he added. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 05:21 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 07:15 pm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wajahat habibullah", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "habibullah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wajahat habibullah govt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "central information commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:09:54.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4d96b587d6f233b47490e16476ba85dca37f553", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEcySQZnjw.52MbCW2lyX70SXuWjziJHIzGxv3EC.u9zKNpcCuSckW.4iRgb5WaVacd2JWkMRNqV41ZhjQX_mkDKvPnlVN0zjv87wWG_cAIHxXJqDee4Dk9yqBj4wdxuZVENBQLmnHu3EoQ.z_KkMeAw43PUe9yXPY_uHFrET1R2E-", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Kashmir unrest: Attack on Srinagar\u2019s most secured location shows militancy will only get worse in future", "title_full": "Kashmir unrest: Attack on Srinagar\u2019s most secured location shows militancy will only get worse in future", "published": "2017-10-03T17:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Encounter_Srinagar1280PTI.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 244, "comments": 9, "shares": 244}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e4d96b587d6f233b47490e16476ba85dca37f553", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEcySQZnjw.52MbCW2lyX70SXuWjziJHIzGxv3EC.u9zKNpcCuSckW.4iRgb5WaVacd2JWkMRNqV41ZhjQX_mkDKvPnlVN0zjv87wWG_cAIHxXJqDee4Dk9yqBj4wdxuZVENBQLmnHu3EoQ.z_KkMeAw43PUe9yXPY_uHFrET1R2E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Devadas", "published": "2017-10-03T17:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kashmir unrest: Attack on Srinagar\u2019s most secured location shows militancy will only get worse in future", "text": "Tweet \nThe war by militants in Kashmir has been stepped up.

There were repeated warnings that this pattern would emerge \u2014 even in the viral recordings of the late militant commander Burhan Wani, more than two years ago. \nIt is therefore obvious that a long-planned and intensely thought-out plan is unfolding. A major step in this plan is to drive a clear divide between the local population and the armed forces, including the state police. \nMorale among these forces and their families has largely held firm so far, but those who have planned what is unfolding remain undeterred. As they step up their violence, they could target other 'mainstream' sections. \nComplacence \nThe government and the forces have shown a tendency to underestimate the challenge. They did so when mass unrest came up in 2010, more so in 2016, and again when street demonstrations complimented encounters from 2015-17. The tendency to underestimate, to pat themselves on the back, and become complacent, is visible again. \nThe most visible initiative of the state government over the past couple of weeks has been a tourism campaign on which vast amounts have evidently been spent. Those supporting the campaign do not seem to see the foolishness of trying to attract tourists at a time when conditions are extremely dangerous, even for locals. \nSome people in south Kashmir say they try not to stir out after sunset and that, even during the day, families remain extremely tense about those who go out. \nA large number of new armed forces camps have come up in south Kashmir over the past few months. Patrolling too has visibly increased. In fact, some residents of the area even say that large stretches have become akin to a cantonment. \nThe forces have no doubt had major successes in locating and killing most of the prominent local militants -- the kind that have a large price on their heads. On the other hand, scores of new recruits have been persuaded to return home. Yet, there is no avoiding the fact that large numbers of boys continue to join the militancy. Not just that, foreign militants have begun to show their hand in north Kashmir -- and now, even in the most secure parts of Srinagar. Large numbers of foreigners have lurked quietly in the north for the past few years. \nTurning a blind eye \nIt is remarkable that, apart from army operations at the Line of Control to try and stop their ingress, the forces have generally not bothered with those who do get in. Now, they are not just showing their hand in north Kashmir, they are moving into Shopian and Budgam districts in south and central Kashmir. (Srinagar airport is in Budgam district.) \nTheir choice of those locations might turn out to be strategically significant, for Shopian and Budgam lie along the western mountain flank of the Valley -- the Pir Panjal range, which separates the Valley from the Chenab basin. \nHowever, just like during the mass uprising that lasted for four months last year, the army and other forces\u2019 brass seem to have turned Nelson\u2019s eye to lurking strategic possibilities. \nThe country cannot afford this. Propaganda is worthwhile if it helps one to outflank the enemy. Deluding oneself is unforgivable. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 07:39 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 08:04 pm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burhan wani", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bsf", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "kashmir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "srinagar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hajin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chenab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "awantipora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pulwama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south kashmir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shopian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "budgam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "srinagar international airport", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:13:35.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f67ef85ae0411b0da1189863541d1b6f464deb3c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWElktV3.OQI2RQV7UUf6kXL7tIdi2QQkWBRAWdVIFoySs_c3XjN0rV7353VtKVl81.yp5r5G.i_che0XxGMVHz4QWctj7eJjl__7_82dAlr2JYq8hNoOjuvY0j8QQ.5gOKuCr28Hg2rrUQQjJvVHD4Srxwoxzugvgv1GLQQlKA2e3na_vJUxa2CTt.uq0ffiZI", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Narendra Modi\u2019s Bilaspur visit: Prime Minister takes dig at CM Virbhadra Singh, asks Himachalis to throw out \u2018govt on bail\u2019", "title_full": "Narendra Modi\u2019s Bilaspur visit: Prime Minister takes dig at CM Virbhadra Singh, asks Himachalis to throw out \u2018govt on bail\u2019", "published": "2017-10-03T16:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Narendra-Modi_PTI.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 29, "comments": 0, "shares": 29}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f67ef85ae0411b0da1189863541d1b6f464deb3c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWElktV3.OQI2RQV7UUf6kXL7tIdi2QQkWBRAWdVIFoySs_c3XjN0rV7353VtKVl81.yp5r5G.i_che0XxGMVHz4QWctj7eJjl__7_82dAlr2JYq8hNoOjuvY0j8QQ.5gOKuCr28Hg2rrUQQjJvVHD4Srxwoxzugvgv1GLQQlKA2e3na_vJUxa2CTt.uq0ffiZI", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PTI", "published": "2017-10-03T16:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Narendra Modi\u2019s Bilaspur visit: Prime Minister takes dig at CM Virbhadra Singh, asks Himachalis to throw out \u2018govt on bail\u2019", "text": "Narendra Modi's Bilaspur visit: Prime Minister takes dig at CM Virbhadra Singh, asks Himachalis to throw out 'govt on bail' Politics PTI Oct, 03 2017 19:31:48 IST \nBilaspur: Prime minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday took a swipe at Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh by asking the people to throw the Congress government, which was \"on bail\", out of the state.

Unhone kaha kaise, puri party hi zamanat pe hai: PM Modi pic.twitter.com/9KHzr9wCB7 \n\u2014 ANI (@ANI) October 3, 2017 \nModi was addressing the \"Abhar\" rally of the BJP in Bilaspur after laying the foundation of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Kothipura in Bilaspur district, Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) in the Haroli constituency in Una and dedicating a steel processing plant at Kandrori in Kangra district online from the Water Sports Complex on the banks of the Gobind Sagar dam. IIIT is not just a college but it is the beginning of a new era: PM Modi on IIIT Una, Himachal Pradesh pic.twitter.com/j2e6NlLdfb \n\u2014 ANI (@ANI) October 3, 2017 \n\"The entire family of the chief minister is facing corruption charges and is on bail. When I asked some Congress leaders why the chief minister was not being replaced, they said how could the party take action when its entire top leadership itself was on bail,\" he said. \nSingh is facing money-laundering charges and a disproportionate assets case. \nAsserting that no case of corruption had surfaced since the BJP-led NDA government came to power at the Centre three years ago, Modi said till 2014, the newspapers were full of reports about scams, be it the Coalgate or the 2G scam, and asked the people of Himachal to \"throw out the government on bail\". \nThe saffron party was fully geared up to take up the reins of power in the state and fulfil the dreams of the people of a clean and efficient government, he added. \nThe NDA government believed in development and currently, 13 major projects involving an investment of Rs 15,000 crore were under implementation, which would accelerate the economic activities and generate employment, the prime minister said. \nHe promised that all the four crore left-out families in the country and those living in \"jhuggis\" (slums) would be provided free electricity connection within the next 1,000 days and claimed that about 70-80 percent of the target had already been achieved. \nModi said roads, electricity, a clean environment and modern facilities would not only benefit the people, but also give a boost to tourism, which is a major employment-generating industry in the state. \nExpressing his \"special\" love for Himachal, the prime minister said the AIIMS, to be set up at a cost of Rs 1,300 crore, would have 30 super-speciality units, 15 to 20 operation theatres, a 750-bed hospital, a medical and a nursing college and added that the \"state-of-the-art\" institution would not only cater to the need of Himachalis, but also of those living in the adjoining areas and tourists. \nAs regards the IIIT at Una, he said it would usher in a \"new era of digitisation\" and prove to be a \"landmark in building a modern Himachal\". \nModi alleged that the Rs 70 crore steel processing plant was delayed over the last 10 years due to a \"tussle between different departments\" as there was \"a prime minister in every department and thus, decision-making suffered\", adding that he sorted out the issues and the project was through. \nModi also lauded the media for highlighting last year's surgical strikes by the Army on its first anniversary, which he said boosted the morale of the armed forces and proved that \"hum kisi se kam nahin (we are no less than anybody)\". \nHe said he wanted do a lot for Himachal, which he described as the \"land of gods, brave mothers and brave soldiers\" and added that there was hardly any village in the state which had not contributed at least a soldier to defend the borders of the country. \nThe acceptance of the One Rank, One Pension (OROP) demand of the ex-servicemen was the \"fulfillment of a promise\" made to them, the prime minister said, adding that three instalments of the arrears had already been paid and the fourth one would be released soon. \nLauding Union health minister JP Nadda for launching the 'Indradhanush' scheme with an aim to achieve total immunisation of the children in the country against dreaded diseases, he said the third phase of the drive had been launched to ensure that every child was vaccinated before Diwali. \nEarlier, Modi, who was accompanied by Union ministers Chaudhary Birender Singh and Satyapal Singh, was received by Himachal governor Acharya Devvrat, chief minister Singh, Union ministers Nadda and Thawar Chand Gehlot and former Himachal Pradesh chief ministers Shanta Kumar and Prem Kumar Dhumal among others. \nThe chief minister presented a traditional Himachali cap, a shawl and a 'thangka' painting to the prime minister. \nThe 68-member Himachal Assembly is likely to go to polls in November. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 07:25 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 07:31 pm ",

teammate Gerard Pique's outspoken stance on the independence referendum in Catalonia. \n\"As for Gerard we see him as he's always been, with the same commitment as ever and the same happiness, even in

came here to play football.\" File image of Spain's Thiago Alcantara. Reuters \nBarcelona's Pique has been an outspoken defender of the wealthy northeastern Spanish region's right to self-determination, and on Sunday cast his vote in a referendum deemed illegal by Madrid that was scarred by clashes between voters and security forces. \nAnd the player's latest declarations have once again raised the debate over his role in the Spanish national team. \nDespite playing a crucial part of the Spain sides that won the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012, Pique is routinely jeered when representing his country. \nThose jeers intensified in front of just a few hundred fans at an opening training session on Monday amid chants of \"Pique leave the national team!\" \nHe has already stated his intent to retire from international football after next year's World Cup, but insisted he could step aside sooner if Spain coach Julen Lopetegui or the federation believe his political stance to be problematic. \nThiago added: \"It's a pleasure to be in the squad, everyone is there on their sporting merits. We're sorry to not be able to speak, to not be comfortable to speak about Albania or Israel which is the fundamental thing for us now.\" \n'Everyone has own opinion' \nTeammate Koke said he was \"already tiring of the subject\" of the referendum, clashes during which left more than 90 people injured, according to Catalan authorities. \n\"It's always talking about the same thing,\" the Atletico Madrid midfielder said. \"But we're professionals and we think about what we have to do, which is playing football. \n\"The changing room atmosphere has been the same as ever, we're all focused on the important game against Albania, we want to win and all but seal our qualification\" for next year's World Cup in Russia, Koke said. \nThiago had the final word, saying: \"We'll talk amongst ourselves in the changing room, about our focus on having to be the best team, to be able to produce our best game. We'll not speak about external things, each person has opinions. \n\"We're here to speak about the team and to do the best we can to ensure our qualification for the World Cup. We're all here pulling in the same direction to get ourselves qualified.\" \nSpain lead Group G of European qualifying by three points from Italy meaning one win from their final two games, against Albania and Israel, is likely to be enough to automatically qualify for next year's showpiece thanks to their far superior goal difference over the Italians. \nTens of thousands of people took to the streets of Barcelona on Tuesday, shouting \"occupation forces out\" and \"the streets will always be ours\" in protest at police violence during the referendum. \n 22  22 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thiago alcantara", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gerard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thiago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerard pique", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julen lopetegui", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fifa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bayern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters  barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catalonia sports afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atletico madrid", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "catalonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:13:43.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50ab29023cb3ff3cc60e73e609c6f54ee443f515", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEFBiIjOhFOkl_ZyLNhS91AUx1es5CUs4EOw8dBfPdtISbWuKDHkM51m7V7sfePPW4PUkQ_XpL2wQqDNYYItj5avRPlgDLBhZuKpw5arcfV78VTsFXKBy0P7AnzoatNPygwjJH_.K9q2w-", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Roman Polanski on 1977 statutory rape case: \u2018It\u2019s over, I pleaded guilty\u2019", "title_full": "Roman Polanski on 1977 statutory rape case: \u2018It\u2019s over, I pleaded guilty\u2019", "published": "2017-10-03T17:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Roman_Polanski__1280.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 91, "comments": 0, "shares": 91}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "50ab29023cb3ff3cc60e73e609c6f54ee443f515", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEFBiIjOhFOkl_ZyLNhS91AUx1es5CUs4EOw8dBfPdtISbWuKDHkM51m7V7sfePPW4PUkQ_XpL2wQqDNYYItj5avRPlgDLBhZuKpw5arcfV78VTsFXKBy0P7AnzoatNPygwjJH_.K9q2w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FP Staff", "published": "2017-10-03T17:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Roman Polanski on 1977 statutory rape case: \u2018It\u2019s over, I pleaded guilty\u2019", "text": "Tweet \nVeteran filmmaker Roman Polanski, who in 1977 in Zurich was arrested for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl by the name of Samantha Geimer, makes an appearance at the same place decades later.

Representational image. Reuters \nThe government filed its response to the rejoinder affidavit of Rohingya immigrants Mohammad Salimullah and Mohammad Shaqir, who have filed the PIL alleging they had faced persecution in Myanmar and were forced to flee. \nIn the fresh surrejoinder (a plaintiff's reply to a defendant's rejoinder), the government submitted that though it was \"fully conscious, aware and responsible about its obligations emanating from various international instruments\", but certain views expressed by Indian representatives and the contentions, based on \"declarations/resolutions/international instruments\" were devoid of merits. \n\"As a sovereign state, India will always honour such obligations which are binding obligations. Having said that,it is reiterated that India is not a signatory to United Nation Convention of 1951 and the Protocol of 1967 issued there under. \n\"The said convention/protocol is, therefore, not binding upon India and no other declaration/resolution/convention/international treaty or instrument of any kind is in force which prohibits India, as a sovereign nation, to exercise its right of deporting illegal immigrants in accordance with laws of India and thereby protecting the fundamental rights of its own citizens more particularly in the interest of national security,\" the Centre said. \nMeanwhile, the apex court on Tuesday fixed a batch of pleas on Rohingya issue for hearing on 13 October and asked the Centre and others to file documents including international conventions for its assistance. \nThe rejoinder affidavit of the ministry of home affairs also said there was no binding legal obligation on India with respect of non-refoulement flowing from any binding international instrument. Non-refoulement means the practice of not forcing refugees or asylum seekers to return to a country where they are liable to be subjected to persecution. \n\"I submit that the illegal immigrants would not get and cannot claim any of the fundamental rights which are otherwise available to non-citizens as the term \"non-citizens\" would necessarily mean persons, not citizens of India, are in India on a valid travel document,\" Mukesh Mittal, joint secretary(foreigners) with the MHA told the court. \n\"The framers of the Constitution of India would not have envisaged a situation where thousands and thousands of people would be flowing into this country entering illegally without any valid travel documents and start claiming fundamental rights as non-citizens,\" he added. \nEarlier, the Centre had termed Rohingya refugees as \"illegal\" immigrants and said that some of them were part of a \"sinister\" design of Pakistan's ISI and terror groups such as the ISIS, whose presence in the country will pose a \"serious\" national security threat. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 07:41 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 08:45 pm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mukesh mittal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammad salimullah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammad shaqir", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sc rohingya", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sc india pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "myanmar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:26:07.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d114dc025d587f2bf8a22b2d3528bbe530e7bb5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEFBiIjOhFOkn55YgBGV0qBkvnmrnWl8dQW_JS9kJTlalv5WNR17UvjBAArrjX5N49HpdfgIJOaCdo8gPk5uo0LuYrheRtLrMNUj8CO3KRCJCQpJ0fFI3wHYfE1csFi16mkMAwuY5a1b84N6MLGpnKk4wfoPPCxdnswFWcgjjPHhv7ouLMBxJxIg--", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Prakash Raj censures Narendra Modi for silence over Gauri Lankesh murder: Why actor\u2019s words are significant", "title_full": "Prakash Raj censures Narendra Modi for silence over Gauri Lankesh murder: Why actor\u2019s words are significant", "published": "2017-10-03T17:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/prakash-raj-facebook2-12801.jpg", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 431, "comments": 7, "shares": 431}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d114dc025d587f2bf8a22b2d3528bbe530e7bb5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEFBiIjOhFOkn55YgBGV0qBkvnmrnWl8dQW_JS9kJTlalv5WNR17UvjBAArrjX5N49HpdfgIJOaCdo8gPk5uo0LuYrheRtLrMNUj8CO3KRCJCQpJ0fFI3wHYfE1csFi16mkMAwuY5a1b84N6MLGpnKk4wfoPPCxdnswFWcgjjPHhv7ouLMBxJxIg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "TS Sudhir", "published": "2017-10-03T17:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Prakash Raj censures Narendra Modi for silence over Gauri Lankesh murder: Why actor\u2019s words are significant", "text": "Tweet \nAt the Manthan Samvaad in Hyderabad (an annual event that is held on Gandhi Jayanti, where eminent people from different walks of life talk about issues concerning the nation), speaker after speaker emphasised the need for citizens in India to speak without fear. \nJust days before that (on 27 September), former Union minister Yashwant Sinha wrote in his column in The Indian Express : \"I shall be failing in my national duty if I did not speak up even now against the mess the finance minister has made of the economy. I am also convinced that what I am going to say reflects the sentiments of a large number of people in the BJP and elsewhere, who are not speaking up out of fear.\" Prakash Raj. Image courtesy Facebook/@PrakashRajOfficial \nOne person who certainly spoke without fear, on the day of Gandhi Jayanti, was National Award winning actor Prakash Raj. Raj questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's silence on journalist Gauri Lankesh's death, four weeks after she was murdered in cold blood. What is significant about Prakash Raj's outburst is both its content, and that he dared to speak out against the most powerful person in the country. \n\"We do not know who killed them (the journalists and rationalists). But we do know who is celebrating the murders. When you see that the Prime Minister of the country is following (on Twitter) those who are celebrating the murders, when he is not taking a stand against it, when he has maintained silence on the issue \u2014 that silence hurts,'' said Prakash Raj. He added, \"As a citizen of this country, I am disturbed, hurt and afraid by the silence of the Prime Minister. I am talking to my Prime Minister and I say, 'Your silence is chilling'. I have a right to say this.'' \nThese are important and strong words. Prakash Raj is saying the Prime Minister has let him down with his conduct. The actor stresses on his right to state publicly, his disappointment that Modi \u2014 a person extremely aware of what is happening around him \u2014 chose to keep mum over Gauri's murder. \nRaj's angst finds expression at a time when the rest of Bollywood, Kollywood, Sandalwood have chosen the path of silence, for they now know the price they have to pay for speaking up. Aamir Khan came under severe attack after his remarks on intolerance in 2015 and was subsequently removed as the brand ambassador of Incredible India. Shah Rukh Khan \u2014 after burning his fingers similarly \u2014 now plays it safe. The most influential voices of cinema have realised that the echo chamber that has been set up both online and offline, seeks a homogeneity of voices and any dissonant/out-of-sync voice is targeted viciously. \nHere, Raj is seeking accountability from the Prime Minister because the Gauri Lankesh case matters to him at a personal level. Gauri was his close friend and her father \u2014 the late P Lankesh \u2014 was Raj's mentor. He feels betrayed by Modi's conduct; his expression of hurt similar to that of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who advised Modi that rajdharma should be followed. \nIf the past is anything to go by, Modi will ignore Raj's barbs. That is also because Raj \u2014 despite his popularity \u2014 is not the kind of figure who would be able to make people rally around him. While his pan-India popularity will ensure for him headline space, it also diffuses the political impact he may make, for the same reason. Though he hails from Karnataka, his body of work is much more in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi. \nIn the past, Raj has refrained from making strong political statements. Is this then a one-off instance, a guest appearance of sorts? Or will the actor try to build on his disappointment by allying with other Modi and BJP detractors and be to the anti-Modi space what Anupam Kher and Madhur Bhandarkar are to the pro-Modi camp? \nIn case Raj is looking for a longer role in the political arena, 'Kamal Haasan Political Productions' could be a possible platform, given that the two actors have worked together and are known to be friends. Raj's powerful oratory could just be the ammunition a non-saffronite Kamal Haasan may be looking for. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 07:38 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 07:38 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "prakash raj", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gauri lankesh", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gandhi jayanti", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yashwant sinha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gauri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aamir khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madhur bhandarkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shah rukh khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kamal haasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atal bihari vajpayee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anupam kher", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "union", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "manthan samvaad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyderabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karnataka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:26:15.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "919ade20eca91f3b7fdbc8425018a571400e53b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWE.Wf.XKNu.25lXi0vK1IT0uUwjRW1XLIBQkGu0Eh7xxE6A3fjEBWUp1KxCFPsd6tva0PKIjDI11DD.Hw1IrF7aO4ubZ90EtFx8BZcJ29tHC8KBFdlYmYbuV7Qwahg_kYjIK6.K3hYgnqXUXIn4P2TTH.CM24f642X5Kz9rEsC1dY-", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "La Liga: FC Barcelona, especially Gerard Pique, not likely to relent on Catalan referendum despite jeers", "title_full": "La Liga: FC Barcelona, especially Gerard Pique, not likely to relent on Catalan referendum despite jeers", "published": "2017-10-03T17:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Pique-Messi-Suarez-Barcelona-Reuters-social.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 33, "comments": 0, "shares": 33}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "919ade20eca91f3b7fdbc8425018a571400e53b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWE.Wf.XKNu.25lXi0vK1IT0uUwjRW1XLIBQkGu0Eh7xxE6A3fjEBWUp1KxCFPsd6tva0PKIjDI11DD.Hw1IrF7aO4ubZ90EtFx8BZcJ29tHC8KBFdlYmYbuV7Qwahg_kYjIK6.K3hYgnqXUXIn4P2TTH.CM24f642X5Kz9rEsC1dY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Priyansh", "published": "2017-10-03T17:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "La Liga: FC Barcelona, especially Gerard Pique, not likely to relent on Catalan referendum despite jeers", "text": "La Liga: FC Barcelona, especially Gerard Pique, not likely to relent on Catalan referendum despite jeers Sports Priyansh Oct, 03 2017 19:38:56 IST Tweet \nOn Sunday evening, Gerard Pique struggled to hold the tears back as he spoke to the media about government repression. The following day, he was the target of irate fans at the Spanish national side\u2019s training sessions \u2014 not for the first time. Within 24 hours or so, the FC Barcelona defender had once again been made aware of the divisions which have existed for decades. \nPique is a rare superstar in football. There have been others who have stood out for their politics but the centre-back is in an unusual position. He plays for a national side which derives its legitimacy from the Spanish state. However, if it was an option for Pique, he would represent Catalonia. But he\u2019s proud to play for Spain too, as long as he is not seen as a disruptive presence. This is an unresolved conflict, for reasons beyond him. Gerard Pique is a soft target for fans who espouse a unified Spain. Reuters \nPique is a soft target for fans who espouse a unified Spain. Here\u2019s a footballer who is FC Barcelona royalty but somebody who has also experienced the highest highs on the international stage. Spanish fans feel cheated. How can you disrespect the very team which gave you the opportunity to become a world champion, they ask? \nWell, Pique\u2019s living a contradiction. But it\u2019s an unacceptable thing only if you chose to wilfully ignore that life, in general, is riven with contradictions. Pique\u2019s conflict is Spain\u2019s conflict. It is also FC Barcelona\u2019s conflict. The club has been historically sympathetic towards the cause of Catalan independence. But it also knows that its status as an elite team derives currency from the Spanish football system. \nJavier Tebas, who openly identifies himself as a Real Madrid fan while serving as the president of the Spanish football federation (RFEF), has already said that an independent Catalonia would mean the ouster of FC Barcelona from La Liga. The differences between the Catalan club and the RFEF have always been apparent. But the resignation by two Bar\u00e7a board members, after the side was forced to play its Liga encounter against Las Palmas on Sunday, suggests that there remains a huge appetite for struggle. \nLeft without choice, FC Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu chose to play the game behind closed doors. It was another of his decisions which did not please anybody, as has been the case throughout his tenure. Empty stands, of course, made a political statement of their own \u2014 one which the RFEF did not approve. A small respite for the federation was that there was no chanting for Catalan independence at 17 minutes and 14 seconds \u2014 done at every game to mark the year in which Felipe V took charge of the city. \nBut playing for three points did not please those who seek Catalan independence either. In their eyes, this is a bigger fight. A forfeited match was nothing in the larger scheme of things, they said. Bartomeu responded. \n\u201cWe perfectly understand that many of our members and fans would have preferred the option of calling off the match. That is why I must say that this was one of the most difficult decisions that I have ever had to make as Bar\u00e7a president. I decided to play behind closed doors because we believed that the image of a football match being played in a completely empty Camp Nou would have been a responsible action and a way of showing how we utterly reject the exceptional and inadmissible situation going on around Catalonia.\u201d \nBartomeu\u2019s statement was an indicator of the compromises which will encircle FC Barcelona in the coming days, weeks, months and possibly years. One would think the way to get out of this mess is to be \u2018apolitical\u2019 like other clubs. But of course, that creates two problems. \nFC Barcelona is not like any other club. Every fan will say so about their team, but it is impossible to understand the 'Blaugrana' without assessing its Catalan manifestation. It is a question of language \u2014 General Francisco Franco forced the official Castilian Spanish on the club during his dictatorship. It is a question of independence \u2014 Franco also oversaw the assassination of club president Josep Sunyol when he was found to support the establishment of a separate Catalan state. It is also a question of freedom \u2014 during the dark years of dictatorship, Camp Nou was one of those few public spaces where symbols and chants of catalanisme could be celebrated. \nSecondly, no club is \u2018apolitical\u2019. Las Palmas chose to stitch the Spanish flag on their jersey on Sunday. Real Madrid continues to pride itself in the role of the club of the \u2018Establishment\u2019. As someone said on Twitter, sport and politics do not mix unless it\u2019s your politics. The fa\u00e7ade wears thin. \nBut after decades of moderate nationalism in Catalonia, why has the independence movement experienced resurgence? Recent years have seen the encroachment of the Spanish state on the region\u2019s autonomy. Catalan people have always seen themselves as distinct from Spain. With the growing fear of erosion of rights and freedoms, it does not come as a surprise that the movement for independence has been re-energised. The weekend bore testimony to the apprehension. \nAnd the assertion of Catalan identity cannot be done without Bar\u00e7a. As the first president of the Catalan regional government in post-Franco Spain, Jordi Pujol, said, \u201cBar\u00e7a is like other folkloric manifestations of our people \u2014 a reserve we can draw on when other sources dry out when the doors of normality are closed to us.\u201d \nFrom Pep Guardiola to Carles Puyol to Pique, Bar\u00e7a heroes have once again spoken out. The conversation is no longer limited to Catalan independence; it is also a question of the clampdown on civil liberties. Even an avowed supporter of unified Spain, Rafael Nadal, chose to speak out against the violence. \nFor an institution which has been accused of not having its heart in the right place lately, FC Barcelona\u2019s response has been reassuring. There is the question whether the club can do more to speak out for Catalan independence. But questions over its own immediate future will wield a heavy influence. \nHundred years after adopting Catalan as its official language, FC Barcelona finds itself at a peculiar stage. If its political aspirations are to be realised, namely Catalan independence, its footballing aspirations will take a hit. Yet it cannot help but be pulled by its different priorities. \nIt is a contradiction which is alive within Pique too. He clearly wants to be a part of the Spanish setup but he\u2019s a proud Catalan as well. His politics is not the majority\u2019s politics. But his voice on Catalan independence rings loud. Pique cannot keep quiet. Not now. \nClub president Bartomeu can foresee a future where Bar\u00e7a plays in a foreign league, if not in Spain. But what about Pique? He will retire from the national side after next year\u2019s World Cup. Perhaps, he can then solely focus on the issues of Catalan pride and freedom. The conflict, though, will remain. Jeering and repression will not put the question of Catalan independence to rest. Pique and FC Barcelona will continue to be unrelenting as well, just like they often are on the football pitch. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 07:36 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 07:38 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gerard pique", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "josep maria bartomeu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bar\u00e7a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carles puyol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josep sunyol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "felipe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bartomeu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafael nadal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "javier tebas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francisco franco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pep guardiola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordi pujol", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fc barcelona", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bar\u00e7a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la liga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "real madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters  pique", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "camp nou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las palmas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catalonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bar\u00e7a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bartomeu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:26:16.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7fdeaa4881dc3e7f13544198a3c5220d5925b20c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWE.Wf.XKNu.26lajEyJVZ7cSjQp6ekqLMK8Vgnay6fRFakylWy6n8vLNlGYSM7BpMXUdn2ZDzYJ4LFi5hJxx56Ig6bbgv.7TUvgJDh7Ln9AiLBOTWgZe_.RE3BcOeyHRKko4_NtGHYw7M-", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Serie A: Lazio\u2019s Curva Nord to remain closed for 2 matches after racist chants", "title_full": "Serie A: Lazio\u2019s Curva Nord to remain closed for 2 matches after racist chants", "published": "2017-10-03T17:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/000_T01JS_opt.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7fdeaa4881dc3e7f13544198a3c5220d5925b20c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWE.Wf.XKNu.26lajEyJVZ7cSjQp6ekqLMK8Vgnay6fRFakylWy6n8vLNlGYSM7BpMXUdn2ZDzYJ4LFi5hJxx56Ig6bbgv.7TUvgJDh7Ln9AiLBOTWgZe_.RE3BcOeyHRKko4_NtGHYw7M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AFP", "published": "2017-10-03T17:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Serie A: Lazio\u2019s Curva Nord to remain closed for 2 matches after racist chants", "text": "Serie A: Lazio's Curva Nord to remain closed for 2 matches after racist chants Sports AFP Oct, 03 2017 19:35:07 IST Tweet \nMilan : Italian club Lazio's Curva Nord (North Curve) stand will be closed for two games after racist chanting by fans against rivals Sassuolo, the Lega Serie A said Tuesday. \nThe chanting aimed at Sassuolo's Claud Adjapong and Alfred Duncan led to warnings being issued over the loud speakers during Sunday's tie which the Roman side won 6-1.

Last time when he got arrested in April, it had taken some three hours for Mallya\u2019s lawyers to do the job. A file photo of Vijay Mallya. PTI \nShortly after the arrest on Tuesday, legal experts had a word of caution that it doesn\u2019t necessary mean Mallya\u2019s extradition to India will happen immediately. The bullet speed bail proved that Mallya\u2019s arrest was more of procedural and it will take a long time for India before Mallya is brought back to the country to face the law of the land in the Rs 9,000-crore Kingfisher bank loan default and alleged fund diversion case. \nNevertheless, the important point is that India\u2019s case against Mallya is now even stronger. The writing on the wall is clear for the \u2018King of Good times\u2019, whose grounded airline, Kingfisher, proved to be a nightmare to a clutch of banks. The second arrest was made after the Enforcement Directorate made a fresh affidavit with more evidence to the UK courts about the charges of fund diversion and financial irregularities allegedly conducted by Mallya. The UK court has found merit in those arguments and hence the arrest. In that sense, this is a major boost to the Narendra Modi government for which bringing Mallya back to home has become a big political issue as well. \nRemember, Modi government has been pushing for Mallya\u2019s arrest and extradition for long, asking various investigative agencies to plug the loopholes as the government seeks Mallya\u2019s extradition from the UK. But, it is now clear that the road is long for the Indian authorities before Mallya is finally brought back to the country's soil. UK laws are tough to deal with in extradition cases. There are several instances from the past. The next hearing scheduled in December will give more definitive evidence about the course of the case and Mallya\u2019s fate. So, the right way to describe Mallya\u2019s second arrest today is that it is just another step towards the target but with no certainty about the final outcome of the case. \nIn April, Mallya\u2019s arrest was made on the basis of a request by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) but this time, according to reports, the supplementary evidence submitted against Mallya has played a critical role in his arrest. In September , the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate have found evidence of Mallya laundering a major chunk of the Rs 6,000 crore bank loans taken for Kingfisher Airlines. This fresh evidence, when submitted, will add more strength to the present case before the UK court, in addition to the existing charges. \nThe Kingfisher case \nThere are multiple dimensions to the Kingfisher-Vijay Mallya case beyond being a normal corporate-bank loan default case. The tug of war between Mallya and banks began in 2012 when Kingfisher was grounded and banks began declaring Kingfisher as an NPA (non-performing asset). But, the reasons that led to an impasse between Kingfisher and some 17 banks actually started long back when banks generously assisted Kingfisher both in the form of fund and non-fund support despite no signs of financial improvement of the carrier. \nWhen Mallya approached the group of lenders for further lending in 2010, there was serious differences of opinion among the group of senior bankers in SBI, and other banks in the consortium, on why should they lend to the struggling airline, which has never made any profit in its eight-year-long life, yet again. But, the majority lenders\u2019 decision was to take a big risk again and lend to Mallya relying on his personal guarantee. \nThe Mallya-banks fight intensified dramatically after the liquor king flew away from India in March last year saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. Since then, Mallya has taken a defiant approach against the charges raised by the Indian banks and the way Indian media covered this case alleging that he is being treated in an unjust manner. For the Modi government, the case soon escalated beyond a typical corporate loan default case to a big political issue. \nTo be sure, there are a number of bank loan default cases which are far more serious than the Kingfisher case in terms of the loan amount. But, Mallya soon became the poster boy of India\u2019s bank loan defaulters, putting immense pressure on the Modi government to take action against him. A victory or otherwise against the battle on Mallya will send a strong signal to India\u2019s bank loan defaulters. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 08:15 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 08:17 pm Tags : #Aviation #Business #Connectthedots #Enforcement directorate #Kingfisher airlines #Narendra modi #Non performing asset #Vijay mallya Also See", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vijay mallya", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mallya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingfisher-vijay mallya", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central bureau of investigation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingfisher airlines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingfisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "npa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enforcement directorate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:13:55.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "71d2510d218a7860bcc294a63b37312155a01177", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEahUtcivKOb8Qo7IIeLHc4yGivxSj0Y8RFOQaSwX2ZzgPJdNgzRzzylZYa4MrZl6.JFcS4osJQS8QOSiFBx6hkXVJAKG1p.nSmEi9SBEJy7nUMOJwaNzztvk0vaR4YpICquyzdaG.qcpCUFlPNnrI2VqjXWqNQ9wUt3NbErB9oxIsrOTg7zKRWsGMGFxUJLnYiD0H6cvYuZ0-", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Ranji Trophy 2017: R Ashwin, Murali Vijay included in Tamil Nadu squad for season-opener against Andhra Pradesh", "title_full": "Ranji Trophy 2017: R Ashwin, Murali Vijay included in Tamil Nadu squad for season-opener against Andhra Pradesh", "published": "2017-10-03T18:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/000_Hkg10233552_opt.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "71d2510d218a7860bcc294a63b37312155a01177", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEahUtcivKOb8Qo7IIeLHc4yGivxSj0Y8RFOQaSwX2ZzgPJdNgzRzzylZYa4MrZl6.JFcS4osJQS8QOSiFBx6hkXVJAKG1p.nSmEi9SBEJy7nUMOJwaNzztvk0vaR4YpICquyzdaG.qcpCUFlPNnrI2VqjXWqNQ9wUt3NbErB9oxIsrOTg7zKRWsGMGFxUJLnYiD0H6cvYuZ0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PTI", "published": "2017-10-03T18:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ranji Trophy 2017: R Ashwin, Murali Vijay included in Tamil Nadu squad for season-opener against Andhra Pradesh", "text": "News Ranji Trophy 2017: R Ashwin, Murali Vijay included in Tamil Nadu squad for season-opener against Andhra Pradesh Senior pros R Ashwin and Murali Vijay were named in the 15-man Tamil Nadu squad to vie against Andhra Pradesh in Ranji Trophy lung opener starting Friday Oct, 03 2017 20:58:58 IST \nChennai : Ignored for India's Twenty20 series against Australia, off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin was on Tuesday named in the 15-member Tamil Nadu Ranji squad along with Test opener Murali Vijay for the season-opener against Andhra Pradesh, starting Friday. \nThe team, to be led by Abhinav Mukund, would miss the services of the experienced batsman-wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik and all-rounder Vijay Shankar. \nKarthik has been picked for the T20 series against Australia while Shankar features in the Board President's XI to face New Zealand.

Representational image. AFP \nHowever, he chose to play a T20 match in the Karnataka Premier League (KPL) match without taking permission from the BCCI. \nGowtham was show caused by BCCI GM (Game Development) Ratnakar Shetty and was barred from taking further part in the Duleep Trophy and his name was struck off from the India A squad that played two 'Tests' against New Zealand A. \nWhile tendering \"unconditional apology\", Gowtham gave a weird explanation as to why he played KPL game on 12 September for the Belgavi Panthers. \n\"I thought it was typhoid but it turned out to be viral fever,\" Gowtham wrote in his apology letter. \nGowtham felt that \"bowling four overs and fielding for 85 minutes\" was permissible being blissfully unaware that he is on selectors' radar having done well in the India A series in South Africa and was supposed to play against New Zealand A. \nThe BCCI disciplinary committee comprising president CK Khanna, senior politician Jyotiraditya Scindia and Niranjan Shah will now take a call on his future. \nWhen contacted, Khanna told PTI , \"Yes, I have received his apology letter. In my view, it has been a huge mistake on Gowtham's part to have disrespected a tournament of Duleep Trophy's stature. He has apologised unconditionally. He is a young cricketer and we need to look at his career ahead.

File photo of Delhi metro. PTI \nIn a statement, the Delhi government said that another fare hike, within five months of the previous one, will act as a burden on commuters and bring down ridership. \nIt claimed that metro ridership has come down five percent each in June and August, compared to the corresponding periods in 2016 and 2015, due to the first round of the fare hike, which came into effect in May. \nThe 16-member Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) Board has three Delhi government representatives: the chief secretary, principal secretary (finance) and the transport secretary. \n\"The chief minister directed the chief secretary to apprise the DMRC board about the notice for convening an emergency DMRC board meeting, on the demand of the Delhi government,\" the statement said. \nThe decision was taken in a meeting convened by the chief minister and attended by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, transport minister Kailash Gehlot, chief secretary MM Kutty, principal secretary (finance) SN Sahai, transport commissioner Varsha Joshi and other senior officials. \nDMRC's own data shows that the fare hike in May resulted in a decrease in ridership by five percent in the month of June 2017, while in the same month in the last two years the ridership had gone up by eight and nine percent respectively. \n\"Further in the month of August this year, the metro ridership showed a decrease of five percent as compared to an increase of 8 percent in the month of August for the previous two years,\" it said. \nIf the hike is effected, the fares will go up by a maximum of Rs 10. \nThe existing fare structure is: up to 2 kms \u2014 Rs 10, 2-5 kms \u2014 Rs 15, 5-12 kms \u2014 Rs 20, 12-21 kms \u2014 Rs 30, 21-32 kms \u2014 Rs 40 and for journeys beyond 32 kms \u2014 Rs 50. \nFrom 10 October, for a distance of up to two kilometres, the fare will remain Rs 10, but for a distance between two and five kilometres, it will go up from Rs 15 to Rs 20. \nFor the subsequent slabs, it will go up by Rs 10 each, which means the maximum fare will be Rs 60. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 08:34 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 08:47 pm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

who was found dead in a Gurugram school, on Tuesday approached the Supreme Court challenging the interim anticipatory bail granted to three Ryan International Group trustees in the case. \nBarun Chandra Thakur, father of Class-II boy Pradhuman Thakur, assailed the Punjab and Haryana High Court order staying the arrest of Ryan group CEO Ryan Pinto and his parents, Group's founding chairman Augustine Pinto and Managing Director Grace Pinto, in the murder case. File image of Ryan International. PTI \nThe appeal, filed through advocate Sushil Tekriwal, said the grant of interim protection against their possible arrest was illegal and unconstitutional and should be set aside. \nThe plea has made the Central Bureau of Investigation, which is currently probing the case, the accused and the Haryana government as a party. \nIt alleged that the 28 September order of the high court granting interim bail was passed without hearing either CBI or the complainant's father. \nRyan Pinto and his parents had approached the high court, seeking anticipatory bail in connection with the killing of the Class II student, who was found with his throat slit in the washroom of a school run by their group on 8 September. \nSchool bus conductor Ashok Kumar was arrested in connection with the crime the same day. \nOn 25 September, the high court had impleaded CBI as a respondent in the petition seeking bail for the three Ryan group trustees. \nThe Haryana government had recommended a CBI probe in the matter following massive outrage. The premier agency took over the probe on 22 September. \nThe Pintos, who are based in Mumbai, had earlier approached the Bombay High Court as they apprehended arrest in the case after the school was accused of negligence in the death of the seven-year-old. \nThe Bombay High Court had rejected the transit anticipatory bail applications of the three trustees but granted them interim protection from arrest for a day to enable them to file an appeal. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 08:29 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 08:36 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ryan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gurugram", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pradhuman thakur", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sushil tekriwal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan pinto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grace pinto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barun chandra thakur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "augustine pinto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashok kumar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central bureau of investigation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bombay high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan international group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haryana high court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "haryana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "punjab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:38:59.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "418de7de9b9189ddc761d33b7c15cb02251304b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEnx2glIryRGAdzOJ_UhpWGbB8YrRxoCrMYeyEfW0g0wNWe5K95F8B.xIDMsbHuwhP_Mo_bCKmcIVZApUNjc_MpOZIAvog.LFkfrL5hyye9uUagvrE6P3sgZZc6KefHJCyTQAPK1tWHRAk2nz5az184b.uq.ZFWZWlE4K0qWTyIQE-", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Posts on Facebook and Google erroneously spread false information about Las Vegas shooting", "title_full": "Posts on Facebook and Google erroneously spread false information about Las Vegas shooting", "published": "2017-10-03T17:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/facebook-getty.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "418de7de9b9189ddc761d33b7c15cb02251304b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEnx2glIryRGAdzOJ_UhpWGbB8YrRxoCrMYeyEfW0g0wNWe5K95F8B.xIDMsbHuwhP_Mo_bCKmcIVZApUNjc_MpOZIAvog.LFkfrL5hyye9uUagvrE6P3sgZZc6KefHJCyTQAPK1tWHRAk2nz5az184b.uq.ZFWZWlE4K0qWTyIQE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AP", "published": "2017-10-03T17:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Posts on Facebook and Google erroneously spread false information about Las Vegas shooting", "text": "Posts on Facebook and Google erroneously spread false information about Las Vegas shooting News-analysis AP Oct, 03 2017 20:25:45 IST Comment \nFalse news that erroneously named a suspect in the deadly Las Vegas mass shooting on Sunday spread on Google and Facebook before the services removed the posts in question, the two companies acknowledged Monday. Representational image. Getty Images \nErroneous posts on both services \u2014 one highlighted by Google's 'Top Stories' search results, the other circulated by Facebook users \u2014 falsely identified the shooter as an apparently uninvolved person. \nLas Vegas police say Stephen Craig Paddock, of Mesquite, Nevada, fired down on concertgoers from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay casino hotel, killing at least 59 people and wounding more than 500 in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Paddock killed himself as authorities closed in. \nBut a story by the pro-Trump political website ' The Gateway Pundit ' named a different person as the shooter, citing a Facebook page to claim the individual was \"a far left loon\" and \"a Democrat who liked (MSNBC host) Rachel Maddow.'' Posters on the anonymous, anarchic 4chan.org forum likewise trumpeted supposed findings that the same individual was both the shooter and a \"social democrat.'' BuzzFeed saved screenshots of the stories, which no longer turn up on either Gateway Pundit or 4chan . \nGoogle said in a statement that it highlighted 4chan 's \"Politically Incorrect'' message board, where the incorrect posts appeared, for several hours before its search algorithm replaced it with more relevant results. The 4chan result only appeared if users entered the erroneous name as a query, Google said. The listing did not appear in Google News. \n\"This should not have appeared for any queries,'' a Google spokesperson said, adding that the company would aim to prevent it from happening again. \nFacebook said its security team removed Gateway Pundit results and other similar posts from its social network, some within minutes. But because that removal was \"delayed,'' the company said, images of the incorrect story were captured and circulated online. \n\"We are working to fix the issue that allowed this to happen in the first place and deeply regret the confusion this caused,'' a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. \nBoth companies are under fire from lawmakers for promoting false stories in the lead-up to last year's election, and have been invited to testify at a congressional investigation into Russian meddling in the race. #4chan #Facebook #Fake news #Google #Las vegas #Las vegas shooting #Politically incorrect #Social media #Stephen craig paddock #Technology \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 08:25 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 08:25 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephen craig paddock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel maddow", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandalay bay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:39:04.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d770a20317639ecff1aaa0bbb324c0c3bacaee74", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEIFOo25Xx2ITh72XTnEKukixXZRhcJFk0yxDPAs_FCQpiQXHXIP7r0K6n9FpWriyLqcootT5BYb92CGR20_mF5FC74uFZpdLhh_NgaOKFkceDX7PLYiK9xw--", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Core sector growth rises to 4.9% in August; highest in 5 months", "title_full": "Core sector growth rises to 4.9% in August; highest in 5 months", "published": "2017-10-03T17:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/COAL_social1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 39, "comments": 0, "shares": 39}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d770a20317639ecff1aaa0bbb324c0c3bacaee74", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEIFOo25Xx2ITh72XTnEKukixXZRhcJFk0yxDPAs_FCQpiQXHXIP7r0K6n9FpWriyLqcootT5BYb92CGR20_mF5FC74uFZpdLhh_NgaOKFkceDX7PLYiK9xw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PTI", "published": "2017-10-03T17:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Core sector growth rises to 4.9% in August; highest in 5 months", "text": "Core sector growth rises to 4.9% in August; highest in 5 months Business PTI Oct, 03 2017 20:21:47 IST Tweet \nNew Delhi: Helped by robust performance of coal, natural gas and electricity, the eight core sectors recorded a five-month high growth rate of 4.9 percent in August, official data showed on Tuesday. \nThese eight infrastructure sectors -- coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilisers, steel, cement and electricity -- had witnessed 3.1 percent expansion in August last year. Representational image. Reuters \nThe infrastructure growth was 2.6 percent in the previous month of July. The core sector growth in August is the highest since March, when it grew by 5.2 percent. \nThe production of coal, natural gas and electricity rose by 15.3 percent, 4.2 percent and 10.3 percent, according to the official data released on Tuesday. \nHowever crude oil, fertiliser and cement recorded negative growth in the month under review. \nThe production growth of refinery products and steel slowed down to 2.4 percent and 3 percent in August as against 2.5 percent and 16.7 percent respectively in the same month last year. \nCumulatively, the eight core sectors in April-August recorded a growth rate of 3 percent as against 5.4 percent in the same period a year ago. \nHealthy growth in key sectors would have positive implications on the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) as these segments account for about 41 percent to the total factory output. \nCommenting on the data, rating agency ICRA said: \"Given the favourable base effect and the expected rebuilding of inventories prior to the festive season, we expect the IIP (index of industrial production) growth to improve in August relative to the initial estimate of 1.2 percent for July 2017\". \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 08:21 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 08:21 pm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "pti", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "index of industrial production", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icra", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "st tweet  new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:39:05.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1db6c1dd77f4ed0ea0dbb81a14c59189c1272e42", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEnx2glIryRGAdzOJ_UhpWGRUNlHwhsj9plE8siuRE6ez7KMTxewcMsUVQ1wTbl_3vfOYwq2rSzD0owa1TBqp934JvaAqfK6lBAHxN6YTE7YRQbggDC.zE2f5VPc3htkF2FRrHNa8tJvjd9BVQYnb2DdIDEjX_dOS2", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Ireland court will ask EU to take a call on the decision to ban the way internet firms transfer user data to US", "title_full": "Ireland court will ask EU to take a call on the decision to ban the way internet firms transfer user data to US", "published": "2017-10-03T17:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/hammer-court-IBNLive11.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1db6c1dd77f4ed0ea0dbb81a14c59189c1272e42", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEnx2glIryRGAdzOJ_UhpWGRUNlHwhsj9plE8siuRE6ez7KMTxewcMsUVQ1wTbl_3vfOYwq2rSzD0owa1TBqp934JvaAqfK6lBAHxN6YTE7YRQbggDC.zE2f5VPc3htkF2FRrHNa8tJvjd9BVQYnb2DdIDEjX_dOS2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2017-10-03T17:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ireland court will ask EU to take a call on the decision to ban the way internet firms transfer user data to US", "text": "Ireland court will ask EU to take a call on the decision to ban the way internet firms transfer user data to US News-analysis Reuters Oct, 03 2017 20:21:27 IST Comment Tweet Ireland\u2019s High Court on Tuesday said it would ask the EU\u2019s top court to decide whether to ban the way in which Internet firms such as Facebook transfer users\u2019 data to the United States in a case with major implications for companies. Representational image. IBNlive The case is the latest to question whether methods used by large tech firms such as Google and Apple to transfer data outside the 28-nation European Union give EU consumers sufficient protection from US surveillance. Data privacy is under the spotlight after revelations in 2013 by former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden of mass US surveillance caused political outrage in Europe. Irish High Court Judge Caroline Costello said she had decided to ask the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the case. \u201cEuropean Union law guarantees a high level of protection to EU citizens ... they are entitled to an equivalent high level of protection when their data is transferred outside of the European Economic Area,\u201d she said. The Irish Data Protection Commissioner\u2019s office initially became involved after Austrian law student and privacy activist Max Schrems made a complaint in Dublin about Facebook\u2019s handling of his data in the United States. The judge said the Irish Data Protection Commissioner \u201chas raised well-founded concerns that there is an absence of an effective remedy in US law compatible with the requirements of Article 47 of the Charter (of Fundamental Rights).\u201d She said that a newly created US ombudsperson dealing with Europeans\u2019 complaints about US surveillance did not eliminate those concerns. Costello also said she was not delivering any value judgement on the data protection laws in the EU or United States. A Facebook spokeswoman said it was essential the EU court \u201cconsiders the extensive evidence demonstrating the robust protections in place under Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and US law, before it makes any decision that may endanger the transfer of data across the Atlantic and around the globe.\u201d The company has previously said the case could lead to a breakdown in transatlantic data transfers that could knock EU economic output by up to 1.3 percent. A ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) against the common legal arrangements used by thousands of firms to transfer personal data outside the EU could cause major headaches for companies. Millions of these transfers happen every day and include credit card transactions, hotel bookings or moving employee data between countries. Schrems, speaking to reporters outside the court, said he hoped the ECJ would force the EU and the United States to finally deal with the gap between what he said were stricter privacy rules enjoyed by Facebook users in Europe compared to those that apply to its servers in California. \u201cI hope we will get a decision that ends this ping-pong and stops kicking the can down the road,\u201d he said. Schrems also said he did not expect the legal arrangements - known as standard contractual clauses - to be banned by the EU court. The Business Software Alliance lobby group, that represents the global software industry, said it hoped the ECJ would focus on how specific SCCs are used rather than whether or not they should be allowed at all, as the clauses can be adapted to provide additional protections. Law firm Linklaters said that it believed the ECJ was unlikely to halt transatlantic data transfers but that its ruling could lead to additional safeguards that could add to costs. \n\u201cThis decision will be closely watched by many businesses as it could have significant implications for their ability to transfer personal data internationally,\u201d Richard Cumbley, partner in Linklaters\u2019 technology group, said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "edward snowden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schrems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caroline costello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard cumbley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max schrems", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "business software alliance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us news-analysis reuters oct", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european economic area", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irish data protection commissioner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linklaters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european court of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "standard contractual clauses", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:39:10.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2172ce98ed2de1e2cbec58df9248f874713df446", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEUvKTe1akG5XXEehkGkvG8Y5i00GVXvEgAJaV_2uuIiDp6UsVSR.SmXGfQLG_B79EM5PuptmAlYDgsAKvkPK5KaGtkCD21THlnNad4k1wP4hjA9FupqT2Obcpvm_PiZQqkXXXZrQ7666FZIqQ39BAdLnM1lhIguwftULfTAFkqsebWRJSu4Guqw--", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "BHU registrar Neeraj Tripathi to take over as VC for two months after Girish Tripathi's goes on indefinite leave", "title_full": "BHU registrar Neeraj Tripathi to take over as VC for two months after Girish Tripathi's goes on indefinite leave", "published": "2017-10-03T16:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.151, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/BHU-PTI.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 57, "comments": 0, "shares": 57}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2172ce98ed2de1e2cbec58df9248f874713df446", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEUvKTe1akG5XXEehkGkvG8Y5i00GVXvEgAJaV_2uuIiDp6UsVSR.SmXGfQLG_B79EM5PuptmAlYDgsAKvkPK5KaGtkCD21THlnNad4k1wP4hjA9FupqT2Obcpvm_PiZQqkXXXZrQ7666FZIqQ39BAdLnM1lhIguwftULfTAFkqsebWRJSu4Guqw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "BHU registrar Neeraj Tripathi to take over as VC for two months after Girish Tripathi's goes on indefinite leave", "text": "BHU registrar Neeraj Tripathi to take over as VC for two months after Girish Tripathi's goes on indefinite leave India PTI Oct, 03 2017 19:23:27 IST \nNew Delhi: Banaras Hindu University (BHU) registrar Neeraj Tripathi will be the officiating vice-chancellor after current incumbent Girish Chandra Tripathi proceeded on indefinite leave, two months before his tenure comes to an end. \nTripathi, who is scheduled to retire on 30 November, went on leave on Monday citing personal reasons. \nAccording to sources, Girish Chandra Tripathi has handed over the charge to the registrar, who will hold the additional responsibility till a new vice-chancellor is appointed.

The lack of security arrangements outside the airport has also ensured that only a limited number of 52 flights operate in the day at the international airport. \nBut Tuesday\u2019s attack came only after militants had carried out a survey of the area and had cut a barbed wire to sneak inside the BSF camp that is located close to the \"entry gate\" of the airport. \n\"The militants were heavily armed. They appeared to be in the age group of 20-25 years and possessed knives and cutters which they used to cut the wire and sneak into the camp that lied on the left side of drop gate. A judge lives nearby the camp and the militants carried out the initial reconnaissance before striking at the camp. While two militants were killed during the night operations only, a third militant continued to fire on the forces from inside the camp before he was killed in the afternoon,\" a senior police official said. \nBesides the AK 47 rifles and pistols, some grenades were also recovered from the possession of the militants, said officials. \nSP Vaid, Director General of Police, Jammu and Kashmir, said that the three militants were of JeM outfit. \"One assistant sub-inspector of BSF was killed during the encounter while four other security personnel received injuries,\" he added. \nA senior police official said that militants came from the Friends Colony side of the BSF camp. The camp lies within the 500-metre outer area of the airport. \nBesides state police, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and BSF also provide security at the airport and the Kashmir Frontier Office of the BSF lies close by. The Srinagar International Airport facility is used after 5 pm by IAF pilots for air drills of fighter jets and houses important arsenal including the many variants of MIG aircraft. \nThe runway and the air traffic control is completely manned by the Indian Air Force and it is only the \"civil enclave area\" which is manned by AAI. \"The runway and the air traffic control is with Airforce while as apron and tunnel building is with the AAI. The airport is used for joint sorties by IAF and AAI. Due to the lack of security in the funnel area of the airport the night landing of civilian flights couldn\u2019t be carried out,\" said officials. \nThe civilian air sorties are made from 7 am to 5 pm and after that, the airport is used only by the IAF authorities for their operations. \nApart from the Srinagar International Airport, the only other strategically important airport in Kashmir is the Koil airport in Pulwama, which unlike the Srinagar airport has much heavy security arrangements. \nOfficials said that besides the inbound traffic of 26 civilian flights a day at the Srinagar airport, the outbound traffic is also an equal number of flights. Sharad Kumar, Director Airport, Srinagar, said that the \"all operations on the airport were run normally despite the militant attack\". \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 09:20 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 09:20 pm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jaish-e-mohammad", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vaid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharad kumar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bsf", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "indian air force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "border security force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central reserve police force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general of police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kashmir frontier office of the bsf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "friends colony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crpf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "airport authority of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "air force", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "firstpost tweet  srinagar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "srinagar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kashmir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pulwama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "humhuma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "srinagar international airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jammu", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:15:18.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4e608f1b8cead042e3c749d969b276dfd98e7ca5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEIFOo25Xx2IRq2xTfnMpFpVKIw7PYlXmVyvsnu0wAE9WLjfI0Rv2LtuiW83s2A4MIydGA4Nd7bZp.hq22cJhwA0i2_0sL1wzzWccdR8UZJoZiVbirzm6PcRj83W8Wch2v.lH0AVb6U3ajC_hZwvIv.g--", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Petrol, diesel prices to be cut by Rs 2 per litre from tomorrow as govt cuts excise duty", "title_full": "Petrol, diesel prices to be cut by Rs 2 per litre from tomorrow as govt cuts excise duty", "published": "2017-10-03T17:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/petrol_social.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 221, "comments": 2, "shares": 221}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4e608f1b8cead042e3c749d969b276dfd98e7ca5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEIFOo25Xx2IRq2xTfnMpFpVKIw7PYlXmVyvsnu0wAE9WLjfI0Rv2LtuiW83s2A4MIydGA4Nd7bZp.hq22cJhwA0i2_0sL1wzzWccdR8UZJoZiVbirzm6PcRj83W8Wch2v.lH0AVb6U3ajC_hZwvIv.g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T17:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Petrol, diesel prices to be cut by Rs 2 per litre from tomorrow as govt cuts excise duty", "text": "Petrol, diesel prices to be slashed by Rs 2 per litre from today as govt yields to opposition Business PTI Oct, 04 2017 08:47:16 IST Tweet \nNew Delhi: Bowing to public pressure, the government on Tuesday cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 2 per litre to moderate the relentless rise in fuel prices witnessed for the last three months. \n\"Govt of India has reduced Basic Excise Duty rate on petrol and diesel [both branded and unbranded] by Rs 2 per litre w.e.f. 4th October,2017 (sic),\" the finance ministry said in a tweet. \nPrices of petrol and diesel will be reduced by the amount of duty cut with effect from Wednesday.

while that on diesel is Rs 17.33 per litre. \nThe government, which had raised duties three years back to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices, has been criticised for not cutting excise duty despite a sustained rise in fuel prices since early July. \nPetrol price has jumped by Rs 7.8 per litre since 4 July, while diesel rates have touched an all-time high after rates went up by Rs 5.7. \n\"This (excise duty cut) has been done to cushion the impact of rising international prices of crude petroleum oil and petrol and diesel on their retail sale prices,\" it said in another tweet. \nThe duty reduction will lead to a Rs 13,000 crore loss of revenue to the government during the remaining period of the fiscal. \nThe government \u2014 which had between November 2014 and January 2016, raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices \u2014has been criticised for not cutting excise duty despite a

"text": "Youngsters sharing social cause related videos on social media are more likely to volunteer for them News-analysis IANS Oct, 03 2017 21:53:47 IST Comment \nYoungsters who share videos of social causes on Facebook might be motivated to volunteer for them in future, finds a study that challenges the popular image of them being \"slacktivists\". Social media \nSlacktivism is a derogatory term to describe young people's political activity online such as signing a petition or sharing a video on social media . \n\"Proponents of the slacktivism narrative argue that by participating in politics in easy ways on social media, young people show their network how virtuous they are, thereby excusing themselves from engaging in more difficult offline action like attending a rally or volunteering for a non-profit,\" said lead author Dan Lane, doctoral candidate at the University of Michigan, the US. \nHowever, the new findings showed that sharing social cause videos on social media might be one pathway to engagement for young people who do not typically get involved in social causes. \nFor the study, which appeared in the journal Information, Communication and Society, the team asked 178 college students to view three social cause videos and then randomly assigned them to post one of the videos either publicly on their own Facebook or anonymously on a third-party's Facebook timeline. \nThe results showed that participants who shared a video about a social cause publicly were more willing to volunteer than those who shared anonymously. \nThis is initial evidence of a \"reverse Slacktivism effect demonstrating that publicly showing support for a social cause through sharing can increase and not decrease the commitment to taking further action, said Lane. \nIn addition, the effect of public sharing on young people's willingness to volunteer was strongest for those who don't normally use social media to engage in social issues.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dan lane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lane",

Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought the responses of the government and the Election Commission of India (EC) on a PIL challenging the recent changes in laws on funding of political parties and alleging that these \"legitimise electoral corruption\". File photo of Supreme Court. AP \nA bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and justices AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud issued notice to the Centre and the poll panel on the plea, which also alleged that the changes would bring opacity into Indian politics and open the doors \"to unlimited political donations\". \nThrough the petition, an NGO has challenged the amendments made to the Reserve Bank of India Act, the Representation of the People (RP) Act, the Income Tax Act, the Companies Act and the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) by the Finance Acts of 2016 and 2017. \nThe NGO, Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), has claimed in its plea that the amendments have removed the cap on political donations by companies and legalised anonymous donations by introducing the use of electoral bonds which can be issued by any scheduled bank for the purpose of funding any party. \nIt said that by amending the RP Act, the donations made by way of electoral bonds are exempted from disclosure to the EC and claimed that this would \"adversely affect electoral transparency and encourage corrupt practices in politics\". \nThe PIL contended that the amendment to the Companies Act has not only removed the earlier cap of 7.5 percent of a company's average three-year net profit for political donations, but a corporate entity now is no longer required to name the parties to which they make contributions. \n\"The companies are no longer required to disclose the break-up of contributions made to different political parties. Removal of the statutory ceiling of 7.5 percent of average profits on donation to political parties now enables even loss-making companies to make donations of any amount to political parties out of their capital or reserves. \n\"Further, it opens up the possibility of companies being brought into existence by unscrupulous elements primarily for routing funds to political parties through anonymous and opaque instruments like electoral bonds,\" the petition has claimed. \nADR, represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan, has also said that by amending the FCRA, foreign companies with Indian subsidiaries have been allowed to fund political parties. \nIt has contended that this would expose Indian politics and democracy to international lobbyists who may want to further their agenda. \nApart from challenging the amendments, the petition has also opposed the method by which the amendments were carried out as money bills through the two Finance Acts. \nThe NGO has alleged that the Finance Acts have been enacted as money bills to bypass the Rajya Sabha. \nIt has contended that these legislations were not money bills as they provided for matters which were in addition to those enumerated in Article 110(1) of the Constitution and therefore, they were bills which had to be routed through the Rajya Sabha. \nArticle 110(1) lays down the constituents of a money bill, the NGO said and alleged that the passage of the two Finance Acts was a \"clear case of constitutional fraud violating the fundamental rights and a colourable exercise of power\". \nThe petition has sought that the amendments made to the various laws be declared as \"unconstitutional, illegal and void\" and their operation be put on hold till the PIL is finally decided. \nPublished Date: Oct 03,

slams Modi govt over 'unprepared' note ban, GST roll-out Politics PTI Oct, 03 2017 21:59:47 IST Tweet \nMumbai : Voicing concern over \"economic slowdown\" and unemployment under the Modi regime, NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday said the current situation of the country was a result of taking steps like demonetisation and GST roll-out without adequate preparedness. \n\"The investment climate in the country is not good today and hence, there are no fresh investments. The Make in India slogan seemed very attractive initially, but its hollowness has begun to show now,\" he said at a press conference in Mumbai. \n\"The decisions of demonetisation and GST taken by the prime minister without adequate preparedness has dealt a heavy blow on the country's economy,\" he said. The veteran leader also slammed the Centre over incidents of terrorism in Kashmir, and said there were loopholes in the policies adopted by the government in the Valley. File image of Sharad Pawar. Reuters \n\"The government should have demonstrated its willingness to establish a dialogue and resolve issues,\" he said. Also taking a dim view of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project, Pawar said technology and modernisation should be feasible. \"I think a bullet train is required between Mumbai and Delhi or Delhi and Kolkata or Mumbai and Chennai. A bullet train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad is impractical. I do not know what is the purpose behind this bullet train. Maharashtra has barely got 4 stations (to be touched by the bullet train), while the maximum stops are in Gujarat. But, Maharashtra has to contribute equal finance in the project,\" he said. \nThe Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, however, hastened to add that he was not against benefits to Gujarat, but only wanted to point out that the project would not benefit Maharashtra. \n\"Instead, the government should have taken steps to improve railway services in Mumbai and Maharashtra,\" he said. Taking a jibe at Railway Minister Piyush Goyal, Pawar said, \"I thought he would have more knowledge about Mumbai's local trains' issues as he belongs to the city. Lal Bahadur Shastri had resigned after a train accident. I expected the same action from the railway minister (Goyal) but it did not happen\". \nA video clip was also played at the press meet, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi was seen saying that a bullet train is to showcase the country's strength. Commenting on the issues faced by Maharashtra, Pawar said his party would take a call on launching an agitation over the loan waiver for farmers. \n\"The chief minister has said that farmers will get a loan waiver by Diwali. But, if that does not happen, we will start an agitation after 5 November. There will be a meeting in Aurangabad on 5 November in this regard. We will take the final call at the meeting,\" he said. \nThe former chief minister of Maharashtra said he has received various suggestions pertaining to the proposed agitation on loan waiver. \"It includes non-cooperation movement and whether or not farmers should pay taxes to the government,\" he said. \nThe NCP chief claimed that the total outgo due to the loan waiver announced by the government would not exceed Rs 12,000 crore because \"most farmers will not be eligible for the scheme due to the government's impractical norms\". Asked about former chief minister Narayan Rane's decision to launch a party, Pawar said, \"He (Rane) could not even induct his own son in his party. What can I say more about this\"? \nPawar declined to comment on RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's critical remarks against the LDF government in Kerala, in which the NCP is a partner. \"I do not take his comments seriously,\" he added. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 09:41 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 09:59 pm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "modi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sharad pawar", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "goyal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lal bahadur shastri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narayan rane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pawar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "piyush goyal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohan bhagwat", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ncp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ldf", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ahmedabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diwali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolkata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmedabad-mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chennai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kashmir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maharashtra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aurangabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerala", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:35:09.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e11b565d117ce24f813ddc45213bc9282e55009", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEnx2glIryRGAdzOJ_UhpWGSiADxiEP295jYsIJxA8gMYjHgcRAFsa4JWVoZpa3AXYRAnecSubgidMKUw7vU16Yw3UDMDKeJ1SjcfR9gQOHayIuhm1iroZ6ZzGrPsNgusbyPLloVDss2_ACd0AJ5FHew--", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Reliance Commodities launches country\u2019s first commodity trading application", "title_full": "Reliance Commodities launches country\u2019s first commodity trading application", "published": "2017-10-03T19:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/mobile-appReuters.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e11b565d117ce24f813ddc45213bc9282e55009", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEnx2glIryRGAdzOJ_UhpWGSiADxiEP295jYsIJxA8gMYjHgcRAFsa4JWVoZpa3AXYRAnecSubgidMKUw7vU16Yw3UDMDKeJ1SjcfR9gQOHayIuhm1iroZ6ZzGrPsNgusbyPLloVDss2_ACd0AJ5FHew--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "IANS", "published": "2017-10-03T19:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Reliance Commodities launches country\u2019s first commodity trading application", "text": "Reliance Commodities launches country's first commodity trading application News-analysis IANS Oct, 03 2017 21:38:24 IST Comment \nReliance Commodities on Tuesday said it has launched the country's first advanced intuitive commodity trading application , available both on the web and mobile.

He had suffered a stroke in 2012 and was moved to a German hospital later that year for treatment. File image of former Iraqi President Jalal Talabani. AP \nTalabani led one of Iraq's main Kurdish factions and went on to become the country's first official president after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. He was often seen as a unifying elder statesman who could soothe tempers among Iraq's Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds. \nTalabani had been absent from Iraqi politics since he was hospitalised in 2012 and his death comes amid soaring tensions between Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region and the central government following a referendum on independence held last week. \nThe referendum, spearheaded by Kurdish president Masoud Barzani, was celebrated in the Kurdish region as a declaration of independence, but the move is not expected to lead to an independent Kurdish state anytime soon and has further isolated the small land-locked region. Baghdad has banned international flights and is threatening to take control of Kurdish borders. \nDreams of statehood have been central to Kurdish politics for decades and in the lead-up to the referendum vote, Barzani repeatedly told supporters he wished Talabani could be there to see it. \nLike many senior Kurdish politicians, Talabani was a longtime guerrilla fighter. In the 1960s, he joined the Kurdish uprising against the Iraqi government and took up arms against the central government again in the 1970s. \nAfter fighting a bitter civil war against forces loyal to Barzani in the 1990s, the two Kurdish factions came together to govern their autonomous region, which boasts its own regional government, parliament and armed forces. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 09:37 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 09:51 pm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jalal talabani", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "saddam hussein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "masoud barzani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "talabani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barzani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marwan talabani", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "world ap", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baghdad", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:35:22.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "73b88ee888ba06867f9b2ed746f3387183c6c3d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEJS2jbbCGw4UB.NdNwmKMaEnhW9Irym_ZhlSDTwN7nBp9OEOL5Boaq1CiwijEMAlbm9sjgAbK_AQT_pZ9wd.JvTsTP95f.F7SQKrMghTkPNbP_PSFNquEWauewmkvh5RS6dMBZbA0co8-", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Dalai Lama expresses grief over Las Vegas massacre, calls for universal brotherhood", "title_full": "Dalai Lama expresses grief over Las Vegas massacre, calls for universal brotherhood", "published": "2017-10-03T19:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Dalai-Lama_Social_PTI.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 118, "comments": 0, "shares": 118}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "73b88ee888ba06867f9b2ed746f3387183c6c3d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEJS2jbbCGw4UB.NdNwmKMaEnhW9Irym_ZhlSDTwN7nBp9OEOL5Boaq1CiwijEMAlbm9sjgAbK_AQT_pZ9wd.JvTsTP95f.F7SQKrMghTkPNbP_PSFNquEWauewmkvh5RS6dMBZbA0co8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PTI", "published": "2017-10-03T19:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dalai Lama expresses grief over Las Vegas massacre, calls for universal brotherhood", "text": "Dalai Lama expresses grief over Las Vegas massacre, calls for universal brotherhood India PTI Oct, 03 2017 22:20:31 IST Tweet \nDharamshala: Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama on Tuesday expressed sorrow over the Las Vegas gunfire deaths and called for a world based on universal brotherhood. \nThe Nobel Peace Laureate said such violence came out of a lack of compassion and respect for life.

The Google Pixel \nGoogle first announced the Pixel and the Pixel XL last year on 4 October. Not looking to create any delays between markets, Google launched the Pixel lineup in India on 25 October, with pre-orders starting the same month on 13 October. The devices were priced extremely high, for a product coming from Google. \nIn India, Google priced the 32 GB Google Pixel at Rs 57,000, while the larger Pixel XL started from Rs 66,000. Clearly, Google had skipped on Samsung and stepped into Apple territory in terms of pricing, something that Nexus users were not too happy about. \nIt was clear on launch date itself that the Pixel and the Pixel XL were overpriced, given their underlying hardware specifications. But what every Pixel buyer was able to see was a smartphone that came from Google, got the latest updates on time, and clicked really good photos. This indeed, was reason enough for most Pixel buyers to jump ship from a smartphone that was made by Samsung, LG, HTC and the lot to a Pixel. More so, it was the first premium offering from Google, and the only choice for Nexus fans, as there wasn't really much of a choice . The Google Pixel XL \nWhile sales, rose taking up a 10 percent chunk of the premium smartphone market share from Samsung (which fell to 23 percent) Apple remained unshaken and enjoyed a 66 percent share back in November 2016 as per a report by the Economic Times . Google was happy with what it had achieved, but that jump in number was just the initial phase. Back then Morgan Stanley too wrote down as to how Google could generate a whopping $3.8 billion in the coming year. \nThe future looked bright, but it clearly, was too early to jump to conclusions. \nBy the end of January 2017, sales of the Pixel had dropped. The handsets were still selling, but sales were sluggish and not as good as the first month. Apple and Samsung had picked up pace and left Google far behind according to this report by the Economic Times . Back then the reason for the drop in interest was the price which was hard to digest even for those who wanted that pure Android experience. As per our report, the drop in sales was not just in India, but even abroad and it reiterated the fact that the idea of Google and hardware never really managed to take off. \nWhy Google is not worried \nAs opposed to what most of us had initially expected, Google's Pixel brand is not really a slap on the faces of manufacturers who had been supporting Android for almost a decade. This is clear, from the fact that the Pixel brand, neither made a big enough dent on the sales of its own ecosystem (Android) nor on others (Apple). \nFrom the way I see it Google's Pixel is about telling the world that Android is a darn good operating system if done right. The Google Pixel 2 XL in white. Image: Twitter/@evleaks \nGoogle pulling of the Pixel brand was indeed all about this. It came at a time when every single manufacturer had taken customisations to extreme levels, killing the image of Android as an OS one can rely on. \nAndroid smartphones even today come with delayed software updates thanks to the level of fragmentation involved. While security patches find their way to non-Pixel devices (eventually) they are still far behind with what has been happening with Apple's iOS platform where all devices get security patches and software updates, simultaneously. \nAnd this is what Google's Pixel is really all about. It is not here to break boundaries or change the game. It's here to simply tell fans and new consumers, that Android can be a really good choice for a mobile OS if done right. \nSo what better way to show off what Android is all about, than a brand that comes from Google itself? Google isn't bothered about sales, it never was with the Nexus program and it never will be with the Pixel either.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "economic times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "htc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google pixel  google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google pixel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgan stanley", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:57:39.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "65989ac58c85e8fa4d88f7580b5ead877dbaa26e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEcySQZnjw.51Zy0MyjJt26oiumSdsHJQPHPUuIZbAqeCTYFsYGcO97O1PPVuyYbWODWUPUW0_M1h1qJvE6DFaYD162zhvl_LnxIpLy4g8tC.LevWqboE96.Czt3mddRbgW5PE_1GUVdm1ZtZ03O4P3g--", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Kailash Satyarthi expresses concern over Rohingya children\u2019s plight, seeks UN intervention", "title_full": "Kailash Satyarthi expresses concern over Rohingya children\u2019s plight, seeks UN intervention", "published": "2017-10-03T19:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kailash-satyarthi_reuters.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 134, "comments": 1, "shares": 134}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "65989ac58c85e8fa4d88f7580b5ead877dbaa26e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEcySQZnjw.51Zy0MyjJt26oiumSdsHJQPHPUuIZbAqeCTYFsYGcO97O1PPVuyYbWODWUPUW0_M1h1qJvE6DFaYD162zhvl_LnxIpLy4g8tC.LevWqboE96.Czt3mddRbgW5PE_1GUVdm1ZtZ03O4P3g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FP Staff", "published": "2017-10-03T19:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kailash Satyarthi expresses concern over Rohingya children\u2019s plight, seeks UN intervention", "text": "Indore: Expressing concern over the plight of children of Rohingya Muslims fleeing Myanmar, Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi on Tuesday said resolving the humanitarian crisis is the moral responsibility of the world community and sought the intervention of the UN.

said on Tuesday that her third-round China Open clash with World No 2 Simona Halep will help the Russian gauge her progress since returning from a 15-month doping ban. \nThe former World No 1, on the comeback trail since April following the ban for taking the banned substance meldonium, had to dig deep as she defeated compatriot Ekaterina Makarova over three sets in the second round. \nSharapova, a lowly 104 in the world and on a wildcard at the China Open, has yet to win a tournament since returning to tennis. Maria Sharapova celebrates after defeating her compatriot Ekaterina Makarova in their women's singles match at China Open. AP \nThe five-time Grand Slam champion said she had endured \"a few ups and downs\" in seeing off Makarova 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. \nBut the 30-year-old is relishing her showdown with the Romanian Halep: \"We know each other's games very well, that's no secret. \n\"They've always been very challenging, tough, competitive, emotional.\" \nSharapova, a crowd favourite in Beijing, added: \"But I love the challenge of playing against someone that's No 2 in the world. \n\"She's a great player, she's had a great year. \n\"Any time you're able to face an opponent that's done something right and well, it's great to see where you are and where your level is.\" \nThe Halep meeting will be a replay of the first-round match between the pair at the US Open in August, when Sharapova made an impressive return to Grand Slam competition before exiting in the fourth round. \nSharapova holds a 7-0 record against Halep, who made it into the next round on the outside Beijing hard courts after Magdalena Rybarikova retired ill in the second set. \nTuesday's encounter with Makarova was the second time in four days that Sharapova had been forced into a deciding set. \nAnd the Russian believes tournaments such as the China Open are only getting harder to win. \n\"There's a lot of depth in the game, by that I mean there's maybe many years ago you'd find yourself working through the first rounds,\" she said. \n\"You knew you're going to get through those first few rounds, it will be straight sets \u2014 you might be rusty, but you'll get through it. \n\"You can't think like that any more, there's too many good players playing the first, second, third, fourth rounds.\" \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 10:12 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 10:12 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maria sharapova", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "simona halep", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "magdalena rybarikova", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ekaterina makarova", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "halep", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "makarova", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharapova", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:57:57.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9e45d90bebcceef345746fb50111c227cac1de81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEz59uzXdUFUJ8m.dqLh7T2arfkIDZdbb3kjSlQxn6GLKD8h2OKGsX_Js0g0254Rz2IzS_.hQbAMeQdyr9Hi6rCcVe8CBpx6dFk_puQ2v.Lhw9jeqQ6kAg3DdbRYVEnxqtWZ1E_qn3C9yj65w_MxjjTQ--", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "President Ram Nath Kovind arrives in Djibouti for four days on maiden overseas visit", "title_full": "President Ram Nath Kovind arrives in Djibouti for four days on maiden overseas visit", "published": "2017-10-03T19:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kovind-Djibouti1.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9e45d90bebcceef345746fb50111c227cac1de81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEz59uzXdUFUJ8m.dqLh7T2arfkIDZdbb3kjSlQxn6GLKD8h2OKGsX_Js0g0254Rz2IzS_.hQbAMeQdyr9Hi6rCcVe8CBpx6dFk_puQ2v.Lhw9jeqQ6kAg3DdbRYVEnxqtWZ1E_qn3C9yj65w_MxjjTQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PTI", "published": "2017-10-03T19:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "President Ram Nath Kovind arrives in Djibouti for four days on maiden overseas visit", "text": "President Ram Nath Kovind arrives in Djibouti for four days on maiden overseas visit India PTI Oct, 03 2017 22:11:35 IST Tweet \nDjibouti City: President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday arrived on the first leg of his four-day visit to Djibouti and Ethiopia, his maiden trip abroad since taking office. \nThe president, who is the first Indian leader to visit Djibouti, was received by Djiboutian prime minister Kamil Mohamed at the airport. President Ram Nath Kovind pays floral tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at Nelson Mandela Avenue in Djibouti on Tuesday. PTI \nDuring his visit to the two African nations, the president is expected to sign agreements on the institutionalisation of foreign office consultation and greater economic cooperation with Ethiopia, Neena Malhotra, Joint Secretary (East and Southern Africa) in the Ministry of External Affairs had said earlier. \nPress Secretary to the President Ashok Malik has said that Djibouti is an important Indian Ocean partner country with whom India's bilateral trade stands at $284 million in 2016-17. \n\"The president is looking forward to the visit. He recognises that the Africa and Indian Ocean region are central to Indian foreign policy. That is why this region was chosen as his first foreign visit,\" Malik said. \nIndia has extended a line of credit of $49 million to Djibouti, mainly for constructing a cement plant. It is a strategically located country just off the Gulf of Aden. \nKovind's visit will be the first by an Indian president to Ethiopia after 45 years. The last visit was by President VV Giri in 1972. \nIndia's bilateral trade with Ethiopia in 2016 was nearly U$1 billion. The country is among the top three foreign investors in Ethiopia with an approved investment of 4 billion dollars. \nIn both the countries, the president will also interact with the members of the Indian community. \nThe president's visit comes in the backdrop of Chinese PLA troops conducting their first live-fire military drills overseas on their base in strategically-vital Djibouti last month, in a major combat display. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 10:09 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 10:11 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

for filing an objection plea against the one-man commission of inquiry formed to probe then Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa's death. \nWhen senior advocate KM Vijayan made an appeal to cancel the

AFP \nCavani and Brazilian Neymar, the world's most expensive player, reportedly fell out over penalty-taking duties for PSG in recent league matches. \nThe despite blew up a couple of weeks ago when Cavani, PSG's regular penalty-taker, refused to let Neymar take a spot-kick against Lyon, only to then miss. \nBut then at the weekend, and after rumours Cavani had been offered a million euros to cede penalty duties to his higher-profile team-mate, Neymar took, and scored, a spot-kick against Bordeaux. \n\"These things happen in football. These are things that are sometimes blown up,\" Cavani, speaking to reporters in Caracas ahead of a World Cup qualifier against Venezuela on Thursday, said on Monday. \n\"We all know that they become bigger than they are. They are sorted out in the dressing room. Every (problem) has a solution. It's calmed down.\" \nDespite giving up spot-kick duties, which Cavani took over when Zlatan Ibrahimovic left PSG a year and a half ago, the Uruguayan has still outscored his Brazilian team-mate eight goals to six in France's Ligue 1. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 11:47 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 11:47 pm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "neymar", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "edinson cavani", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "edison cavani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cavani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zlatan ibrahimovic", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "psg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ligue", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "paris saint-germain", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caracas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bordeaux", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uruguay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:46:44.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fd39fe94be401f980b4d6562053545e8bac98aad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEFBiIjOhFOkkPP6QYjyn2Qohj4sXoZx7g9H68isQClKdvgBLaJfEPKSPVEe8QxzuLIVlo8ueOWskrTb_eqbXPX2idQokozH1ELRdrGLSqpjhMMKdJ8HJ9gKMQbGK99jBFAArt5ZXHOCipH.sF2sIWH9asNlMpt7iLo29o3YiQG54-", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Bigg Boss 11, Episode 2, 3 October 2017: Shilpa Shinde, Jyoti, Zubair, Arshi and Bandgi get nominated", "title_full": "Bigg Boss 11, Episode 2, 3 October 2017: Shilpa Shinde, Jyoti, Zubair, Arshi and Bandgi get nominated", "published": "2017-10-03T21:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/First-nomination-picture-on-Bigg-Boss-season-11.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 520, "comments": 2, "shares": 520}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fd39fe94be401f980b4d6562053545e8bac98aad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEFBiIjOhFOkkPP6QYjyn2Qohj4sXoZx7g9H68isQClKdvgBLaJfEPKSPVEe8QxzuLIVlo8ueOWskrTb_eqbXPX2idQokozH1ELRdrGLSqpjhMMKdJ8HJ9gKMQbGK99jBFAArt5ZXHOCipH.sF2sIWH9asNlMpt7iLo29o3YiQG54-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Seema Sinha", "published": "2017-10-03T21:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bigg Boss 11, Episode 2, 3 October 2017: Shilpa Shinde, Jyoti, Zubair, Arshi and Bandgi get nominated", "text": "Tweet \nBarely two days into the Bigg Boss house and contestants have started discussing who they approve of and who they can\u2019t tolerate. Jyoti Kumari faces the brunt by most as they find her \u201cmannerless\u201d and \u201cloudmouth\u201d. Sapna Chaudhary and Bandgi Kalra spell out their issues with Jyoti. Soon after, Shivani Durga is heard telling Sapna that whoever plays the divide and rule policy well in the house, will be the winner. \nThe day starts with Hina Khan and Benafsha Soonawala getting a surprise true Bigg Boss way. Bringing in their birthday with strangers, Hina and Benafsha are treated to a grand birthday cake. As the day progresses, Hina is tasked with mopping the floor, and she takes on the responsibility of cleaning the bathroom with a pocha \u2013 what a day to celebrate your birthday! Bigg Boss 11 contestants during nominations. \nFurther, padosis call the gharwales to inquire about their breakfast. Luv Tyagi, one of the padosis makes the call, and Arshi, who answers the phone, tries to seduce him and tells everyone that Luv was trying to flirt with her. Next, Arshi and other contestants discuss Vikas Gupta\u2019s sexual preferences with Shilpa, who has known him for the longest time. But Shilpa doesn't want to talk about it. Shilpa says that she doesn\u2019t want to get into any trouble by commenting on it. \nWith everyday chores being handled by gharwalas, the padosis are given their first task. Bigg Boss asks them to come together as a family and work on a backstory that binds them all together. \nAll contestants are in for a huge shock as Bigg Boss announces the first ever nomination of the season which they have to make public with a valid reason supporting their decision. Each contestant has to nominate two inmates by putting a stamp on their face. Much is revealed in this public nomination and contestants soon realize the worth of keeping their guard up. There is a face-off between reality show queen Benafasha Soonawala and commoner Jyoti Kumari; with Jyoti telling Benafsha not to order her around and mind her own business. \nAfter going through the whole process with each contestant giving their own reasons, nominated contestants include: Shilpa, Hina, Jyothi and Zubair. But there is a twist to this. The padosis are given a special power to turn things around \u2013 they have the authority to save one person from nomination and add two people to the nomination roster. \nPadosis save Hina as they find her cool and sensible. They nominate Arshi as they feel her choice of words was not correct. They also nominate Bandgi because, \u201cShe was found confident when she entered the house and she had called herself a celebrity among the commoners, but now she was not seen or heard at all\u201d. Shilpa, Jyoti, Zubair, Arshi and Bandgi finally get nominated. Later, when Luv calls for tea, Arshi, who picks up the phone, refuses to send them tea because the padosis were responsible for her nomination. \nEveryone has gathered about the dinner table and a conversation between the contestants leads to Vikas losing his temper against Akash. Things get ugly as Vikas tells Akash that he is not fit to be on the show and that he was commenting on everyone\u2019s personal life for attention. Akash was the one who was found more vocal about Vikas's preferences. Akash is also told that he needs to change his behavior. Soon, all contestants, barring Shilpa, take a stand and go against Akash. \nPublished Date: Oct 03, 2017 11:41 pm | Updated Date: Oct 03, 2017 11:46 pm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shilpa shinde", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bandgi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jyoti", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "zubair", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bigg boss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hina khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sapna chaudhary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benafsha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shilpa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luv tyagi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vikas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arshi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "padosis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jyoti kumari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shivani durga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bandgi kalra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jyothi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benafsha soonawala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benafasha soonawala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vikas gupta", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bigg boss house", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hina", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "arshi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sapna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bandgi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:46:54.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be4eb9a8163e0bba11ee488e222e33ee750dcee1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEnx2glIryRGAdzOJ_UhpWGWf6kyaNxFUmaCIBGOeQuJsl_UbS8yqaUqcIAWjT.4ss8dcl.2zavhxbs_0MN_w519q62HRQ.b9uhZ8HSW3vhkrBxEPof9.qB1mEn2scxibnHMhfQNxI4TOi.v9GksauZuO_2CosFJdJkaD0E_Kj78N3jXiEFInK0w--", "site_full": "www.firstpost.com", "site": "firstpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.firstpost.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Firstpost", "title": "Uber promises to make things right in London after \u2018constructive\u2019 meeting with the transport regulator", "title_full": "Uber promises to make things right in London after \u2018constructive\u2019 meeting with the transport regulator", "published": "2017-10-03T21:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/uber1-380p1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1168, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be4eb9a8163e0bba11ee488e222e33ee750dcee1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_iwz6VMN0gZxssDM7bUbWEnx2glIryRGAdzOJ_UhpWGWf6kyaNxFUmaCIBGOeQuJsl_UbS8yqaUqcIAWjT.4ss8dcl.2zavhxbs_0MN_w519q62HRQ.b9uhZ8HSW3vhkrBxEPof9.qB1mEn2scxibnHMhfQNxI4TOi.v9GksauZuO_2CosFJdJkaD0E_Kj78N3jXiEFInK0w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2017-10-03T21:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Uber promises to make things right in London after \u2018constructive\u2019 meeting with the transport regulator", "text": "Uber promises to make things right in London after 'constructive' meeting with the transport regulator News-analysis Reuters Oct, 03 2017 23:38:55 IST Comment Tweet \nUber promised to make things right in London after its new global boss had a \u201cconstructive\u201d meeting with the city\u2019s transport regulator to try to hold on to the app\u2019s operating license in one of its main foreign markets. Representational image. Reuters \nTransport for London (TfL), which runs and regulates the British capital\u2019s transport system, shocked Uber last month by deeming it unfit to run a taxi service and refusing to renew its license . It cited the firm\u2019s approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers. \nBoth TfL and Uber described Tuesday\u2019s meeting between the Silicon Valley firm\u2019s new Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi and TfL Commissioner Mike Brown as \u201cconstructive,\u201d with the dialogue set to continue. \n\u201cWe hope to have further discussions over the coming weeks as we are determined to make things right in London,\u201d an Uber spokesman said. \n\u201cToday\u2019s constructive meeting centered on what needs to happen to ensure a thriving taxi and private hire market in London where everyone operates to the same high standards,\u201d TfL said in a statement. \nUber\u2019s license expired on 30 September but its roughly 40,000 drivers are still able to take passengers until an appeals process is exhausted, which could take several months. \nReuters reported on Monday that Uber\u2019s top boss in Britain, Jo Bertram, would be quitting in the next few weeks to take up an undisclosed new role outside the company. \nUber\u2019s British management has been criticized by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who is also chairman of TfL. Khan said the firm needed to spend less time hiring \u201can army of PR experts and an army of lawyers\u201d and instead address issues raised by TfL. \nKhan, a center-left politician from Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party, approved Tuesday\u2019s meeting between Khosrowshahi and Brown, who is in charge of TfL\u2019s day-to-day operations. \nBoard Meeting \nKhosrowshahi was appointed Uber chief executive in August, replacing co-founder and former boss Travis Kalanick and has promised change at the $70-billion dollar firm. \nHe is battling to steer a new course for the app, which has faced regulatory crackdowns, court cases, bans and protests around the world, as well as several boardroom controversies. \nIn a sign of broader problems facing Uber, Khosrowshahi is also expected to call into a contentious board meeting in San Francisco on Tuesday which will look at cutting the influence of Kalanick, sources familiar with the matter said. \nThe meeting will consider proposals to strip early investors of super-voting power and secure a multibillion-dollar investment. Kalanick, ousted by investors in June, contends that fellow Uber board members are moving too fast on a dramatic restructuring, the sources said. \nTrying to repair relations with the authorities in London, Khosrowshahi last week struck a more conciliatory tone in an open letter to Londoners, marking a new approach for a firm that has adopted a combative style to break into closed markets around the world. \n\u201cIt\u2019s ... true that we\u2019ve got things wrong along the way. On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologize for the mistakes we\u2019ve made,\u201d he wrote in the open letter. \nUber\u2019s fate in London will be decided by a judge who will rule on the appeal after it is submitted by 13 October. \nUber\u2019s competitors are already trying to take its business. London\u2019s second-biggest private hire firm Addison Lee said last week it was planning to increase its driver numbers in London by up to a quarter. #Constructive meeting #Dara khosrowshahi #London
