But It Won't Stop Mass Shootings Alex Wong/Getty Images In the aftermath of mass shootings in the United States, like Sunday evening's Las Vegas tragedy that killed at least 58 people and wounded over 500, a debate often emerges about how to prevent such incidents from occurring again. Part of that heated and longstanding gun-control battle is the question of whether technology can make guns safer. And they can\u2014but not in a way that can prevent many of the country's most high profile attacks. The bulk of the technological gun-control effort lies in \"smart\" firearms technology. That means smart guns, which can only be fired by their owner or approved users, and smart safes and locks that can only be opened by approved parties. Those have the potential to reduce accidental shootings, and to make stolen guns less valuable. But they do nothing to prevent the legal owner of a firearm from using it in a malicious way. While it's unclear whether the Las Vegas shooter\u201464-year-old Stephen Paddock\u2014used his own rifles in the attack, he did frequent gun shops, and could legally buy firearms. And in general, experts say that the majority of mass shooters use guns that they legally purchase, making it more difficult for smart guns and other technology to play a role in stopping them. \"Smart guns have the greatest impact around teen suicide, accidental deaths, and disrupting the stolen gun market,\" says Margot Hirsch, the president of the gun safety advocacy group the Smart Tech Challenges Foundation. \"We would never say that smart guns will prevent mass killings, but if we can bring attention to making our firearms safer in general then we can save a lot of lives.\" 'There\u2019s not a lot of technology development going on in firearm safety right now.' Kai Kloepfer, Biofire A discussion about smart guns that assumes mass adoption\u2014which would need to happen for that sort of large-scale efficacy\u2014also feels unrealistic in the current climate. The gun lobby has mostly met safety mechanisms based on mobile technologies like digital authentication with resistance. Organizations like the National Rifle Association say that they are in favor of anything that makes guns safer, but fear smart-gun mandates, which would make guns more difficult to distribute and share by tying them more narrowly to assigned users instead of all being accessible to anyone. Gun owners and advocates have also worked to undermine the proliferation of smart guns by questioning their reliability, and claiming that dependable smart guns don't exist. \"They\u2019ve fought smart guns tooth and nail,\" says Robert Spitzer, a political science researcher at SUNY Cortland who studies Second Amendment and gun control issues. \"They argue that the technology is unproven even though they don\u2019t want to see any research and development to improve the technology. [The NRA] is anti-safety technology, but pro-development in the sense that they\u2019re all in favor of more exotic weaponry, advanced features, and things like making it easier to buy silencers.\" That resistance dates back decades. Gun groups famously threatened to boycott Smith & Wesson in the 1990s over its smart-gun development, nearly putting the company out of business. Experts say that this opposition has cowed potential gun-safety developers, making it difficult to know what could be technologically possible for gun safety, and whether options could even potentially exist to dealing with mass-shooter situations that currently don't have a clear technological solution. \"There\u2019s not a lot of technology development going on in firearm safety right now,\" says Kai Kloepfer, the founder of gun-manufacturer Biofire, which focuses on adding mobile tech to guns for safety. \"It's mostly technology that helps to assist the user to control their own firearm. I haven't seen anybody working on something that's more technology as gun control. If a business was perceived as gun control you probably wouldn\u2019t be able to sell anything.\" Existing smart gun options have also been met with some criticism. Skeptics claim high failure rates, and one smart gun model recently was shown to be hackable with just $15 worth of magnets . But the technology can improve. In a joint report on smart guns to President Obama in April 2016, the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Defense wrote, \"Much of the basic technology exists. Firearms manufacturers will need to decide whether to make ... investments here.\" And safety advocates argue that the emerging nature of the technology shouldn't disqualify smart guns altogether. \"There\u2019s a hypocrisy in the gun community to some degree when it comes to the reliability question,\" Hirsch says. \"Traditional guns fail all the time. We allow bad-quality firearms to be sold that are made by subpar manufacturers, but we don\u2019t want to develop a higher level of safety. It\u2019s so sensitive and so polarized.\" More Stories", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kai kloepfer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert spitzer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margot hirsch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hirsch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen paddock", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national rifle association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "departments of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith & wesson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suny cortland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smart tech challenges foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "homeland security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:22:51.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a4441b76c477c92687013c25141f26ba310f914e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjIDkAGY.Jp7SY89oIarVmY6fzPUUBk8DJlMgqN5Ko2dX3h3B9neFQyTk76hRP53U-", "site_full": "www.wired.com", "site": "wired.com", "site_section": "http://www.wired.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Feed: All Latest", "title": "Google Holds Its Big Pixel Event Tomorrow.

Here's What's at Stake", "text": "Google's Perfect Future Will Always Be Just Around The Corner As they say, hardware is hard. It's a ruthless and low-margin business, but it's also an important one. Building gadgets in-house gives Google an opportunity to assert itself beyond what any of its partners can offer. More importantly, it gives Google a chance to control its destiny in an increasingly uncertain time. \"As new technologies spin out of mobile, Google wants to make sure its own high-end hardware highlights that\u2014whether it\u2019s Assistant or Daydream or Tango, even the Internet of Things,\" says Avi Greengart, a devices and platforms analyst for GlobalData. \"Google needs Samsung, it likes Samsung, but as the platform driver it doesn\u2019t want to be entirely dependent on Samsung.\" Depending on Samsung is a dangerous game. Galaxy products are the most popular Android phones by far, and the prime iPhone competition. But every year, you can feel Samsung leaning a little further away from Google. It built the Bixby assistant, which competes directly with Google Assistant, and gave Bixby prime placement on its phones. Samsung builds its own browser, email client, and messaging app, which seem utterly redundant unless Samsung's trying to wean its reliance on Google products. Samsung mostly eschews Daydream in favor of Gear VR, and has a home-grown smart-home platform competing directly with Nest, Android Things, and all the other Google connected-home products. Over the last few years, Samsung's been hammering away at Tizen, its own operating system, which already runs on the company's wearables. Save for the Play Store's un-replicable app selection, Samsung barely needs Android at all. Soon enough, Android's power might wane for everyone else as well. New platforms like Amazon's Alexa pose something of an existential threat to Google. Alexa can give you directions through Google Maps, or another mapping app. You can listen to Google Play Music, or Spotify. If you buy an Echo, you might someday never use Google, and you might not even notice. Google could go to the HTCs and LGs of the world, build phones and speakers with them, and try to grow competitors in the wild. Except that doesn't work\u2014Google's been trying for years with the Nexus program to inspire and convince others to build better, cleaner, more powerful Android phones, but everybody just keeps buying Galaxies. So that's the danger in not making hardware. There's also opportunity in doing so. Just look at Apple, which spent the last decade taking the idea of vertical integration to its extreme. It doesn't just design and assemble its own phones, it's also responsible for many of the most important parts inside. By any measure, the latest crop of iPhones are the most powerful smartphones on the market, thanks to Apple's own A11 Bionic processor. As other companies converge on identical performance metrics, commoditizing a \"Good Phone,\" Apple's jumped to a whole different level. That's why its augmented-reality tech works so well, why its cameras are consistently the best on the market, and even enables minor-but-crucial things like rock-solid Bluetooth connection. As the next phase of tech comes into the market, that kind of power and control become even more important. \"Tiny EarPods, Smart Watches, Augmented Reality, Adaptive Acoustics require wrapping your arms around all parts of the problem,\" the analyst Horace Dediu wrote recently. \"The integration and control it demands are in contrast to the modular approach of assembling off-the-shelf components into a good-enough configuration.\" Think about the next version of Google Glass (or whatever non-flashback-inducing new name Google gives its face-puter). Making that work will require highly specific work in batteries, processors, screens, cameras, and more. The off-the-shelf version looks like, well, Glass. The custom version, built in-house and in tandem with the software, firmware, and wireless teams at Google, could be much better. Right now, the company's making a smartphone for the same reason Andy Rubin's Essential started with a smartphone , the same reason anyone talks themselves into entering this preposterously huge market: It's the most important device anyone owns. Google seems to believe it's big and popular enough that it can wedge its foot in the door of the market, and at least take a piece of the high-end smartphone universe. But that's actually the easy part\u2014 the last Pixel was great , and HTC made it. The real reason to take everything internal is to be able to control and improve what comes after. Saying \"we're a hardware company!\" and actually becoming a successful one are two radically different enterprises, though. That HTC group Google just bought? They've made great phones for a decade, but thanks to some bad carrier-exclusivity decisions and a truly terrible marketing plan, its products stayed under the radar. (Meanwhile, Samsung's marketing department bought the radar and trained it to only recognize Samsung products.) The Pixel, which is a great phone, didn't exactly take the world by storm either. Google hasn't reported exact sales, but one estimate showed a million Pixels in the market; another said between three and five million. That's due in part to Google's total inability to keep the phone in stock\u2014another downside of not managing your own hardware\u2014but doesn't inspire much confidence. Either way, Greengart says, \"it certainly hasn\u2019t been a dominant player in the high-end of the market. It doesn\u2019t play at all in one of the biggest markets, China. I can\u2019t see Huawei or Xiaomi or Oppo being worried.\" Apple and Samsung haven't lost sleep either. But Google has to try. As we've learned time and again, the best products come from companies that make both hardware and software, each working to optimize and improve the other. Samsung knows it; Apple knows it. As we enter the next phase of tech, where smartphones give way to smart watches and smart speakers and smart lightbulbs and smart cars, there's no room for too-big parts or inefficient software. The winners will be the companies who figure out how to do everything right: hardware, software, marketing, everything. Apple nailed it with phones, and became the richest company in the world. There's another chance coming. Related Video Gadgets The Jean Jacket of the Future Remember Marty's jean jacket from \"Back to the Future\"?

He asked his staff to build a dashboard where he could track 10 key metrics, including the city's violent-crime rate, its sales-tax income, and its paramedic response times, and see how they fluctuated over time. In theory, it was a smart idea that could lead to better-informed spending and decision-making. In practice, though, it meant that Rebecca Woodbury, a senior management analyst for the city of almost 60,000 people just north of San Francisco, spent her days calling other departments, asking for their newest numbers, and compiling them into an unwieldy Excel spreadsheet. Then, because the mayor is an airplane geek, she\u2019d use clip art of airplane dials to visualize the data. \u201cIt\u2019s honestly embarrassing to look at,\u201d Woodbury says now. \u201cIt would take a lot of time to make something that didn\u2019t even look very good.\u201d That\u2019s all changed now, she says. San Rafael is one of a dozen cities that recently began testing a new tool created by the Redwood City, California-based OpenGov, which organizes and visualizes data from local governments. Called Performance Measures 1 , it enables people like Woodbury to easily create visuals that track everything from brush fires to local greenhouse-gas emissions. \u201cI\u2019ve always been jealous of the bigger cities that have data teams and data officers,\u201d Woodbury says. \u201cThis gives more power to smaller cities that don\u2019t have data teams and graphic designers.\u201d Mockup of city data displayed in OpenGov\u2019s Performance Metrics tool. OpenGov Founded in 2012, OpenGov provides budgeting tools to more than 1,500 public agencies in 48 states. With that tool, local governments create websites that let their constituents see, in bar graphs and charts, how their tax dollars are being spent. Performance Measures builds on that work, allowing officials of those governments to see not only where the money\u2019s going, but what they have to show for it. The company is backed by notable names including Steve Jobs' widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, and a venture-capital firm started by Joshua Kushner, brother of White House adviser Jared Kushner. Earlier this year, OpenGov CEO and co-founder Zac Bookman was the only small-company CEO invited to a White House tech summit that included Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Apple CEO Tim Cook. But while Bookman has rubbed elbows at the highest levels of the federal government, his company focuses on cities and states. The Performance Measures tool arrives at an inflection point for government transparency. \u201cTrust levels in government are at a historic low,\" Bookman says. \"People don\u2019t feel government has been effective.\u201d And yet, since the day he took office, President Trump\u2019s administration has removed critical data on issues like climate change and sexual assault from federal-agency websites. That only heightens the urgency for cities and other local governments to preserve data and share it with an American public that wants to hold elected officials accountable. OpenGov\u2019s budgeting tool essentially took the thousands of rows of Excel sheets many cities use to track spending, and produced easy-to-read charts so that any citizen or government worker could see, for instance, how much of the police department's salary budget was being spent on overtime pay. Performance Measures does much the same thing for data beyond the budget. It allows cities to upload all of their data, for instance, on the time it takes to answer 311 service requests or the number of potholes that have been filled. The tool is intended less for public consumption than for the busy decision-makers inside these local governments. \u201cWe kept hearing over and over that the higher up you get in government, the less time you have to dive into the details,\u201d says Jonathan Brandon, OpenGov\u2019s product marketing manager who helped develop Performance Measures. Now, instead of sending a PDF of airplane dials to San Rafael\u2019s mayor once a month, Woodbury has created an online dashboard where, she says, \u201cIf at 2 am the mayor wants to know how many assaults happened last month, he can take a look.\u201d She\u2019s gradually adding to the mayor's initial 10 metrics as well. City officials, for instance, recently noticed a spike in illicit massage parlors popping up around town, and earmarked $250,000 for additional police inspections in hopes of cracking down on the problem. Those inspections amass lots of data, including the number of parlors receiving citations, paying fines, and shutting down. Woodbury wants to track those metrics on OpenGov\u2019s tool, too, so officials will know when they may be able to scale back the additional funding. For Woodbury, and others like her, the benefits of this kind of tool are local. And yet, if more cities adopt similar tools\u2014and make the data available to researchers and the public\u2014it's easy to see how it could create an alternative trove of nationwide data that could help shape policy far beyond the local level. That, says Brandon, is the ultimate goal. \u201cOur long game is to create a network that allows governments to share this information with each other,\u201d he says. Here's to restoring faith in democracy, one pie chart at a time. 1 Correction, 10:06am ET: OpenGov's new tool is called Performance Measures.

In many cases what\u2019s considered good or bad is totally subjective. To some, bass-heavy cans bring out the beauty in classical music. For others, they can muddle the nuances of flutes and strings. The result is that most people have no idea how to describe what sounds good or bad to them. They know what they like, but not why. This is a problem, says Kyle Slater, the co-founder of audio company Nura . \u201cWe think the vast majority of people don't hear good sound,\u201d he says. Slater, who earned a PhD in psychoacoustics, worked with his co-founders to develop a pair of headphones they believe might be able to deliver objectively great sound to whoever is wearing them. The company claims its new Nuraphones, which cost $399, can measure an individual\u2019s audio profile and adjust the resulting sound to her specific acoustic preferences. Nura The company does this through what it claims is an adaption of a common hearing test that measures what\u2019s called otoacoustic emissions . Slater explains that when sound goes into the ear, it travels through three little bones that connect to a spiral, liquid-filled object called the cochlea. \u201cThe cochlea is like a microphone inside the body,\u201d he says; it's the cochlea's job to translate vibrations into electrical signals the brain can read. A byproduct of this process, a faint vibration called the otoacoustic emission, echoes back outward through the ear where it can be recorded and analyzed. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible feedback mechanism,\u201d he says. Two silicon earbuds sit on the inside of the Nuraphones where small, but powerful, microphones capture that otoacoustic feedback. During set up, the Nuraphones prompt you to listen to a 60 seconds of jumbled frequencies that range between a low 250hz and a high 8kHz. The company's software can then determine which frequencies a set of ears hears most clearly and which is hears poorly. Each ear is measured individually and then averaged to create a sonic profile. Some people, Slater says, lack the ability to make out high frequency sounds like tambourines and flutes. Others are more attuned to perceiving low-frequency beats. \u201dNo two ears are alike,\u201d he says.

It exists to convey information: speed, the fullness of the gas tank or battery, miles driven, the occasional warning about low oil or tire pressure. But auto designers have long had greater ambitions for this prime real estate, right in the driver's line of sight. They see the potential for personalization, for excitement, for a selling point in the ever competitive industry. Modern drivers, after all, demand maps with navigation instructions. They want music album art and extra readouts of turbo boost, or oil temperature. And so designers have turned to screens. The trend started with high-end rides, the Range Rovers and Audis, but has trickled most of the way down to mass market offerings. The trend is so pervasive, not even the folks working on the classics can claim immunity. Just look at the 2018 Mustang GT, the latest version of the famed pony car. Ford's designers squeezed an (optional) 12-inch LCD screen behind the steering wheel, in the hopes of emphasizing (and not ruining) the car's sporty appeal. For the purists, the digital dash can display the traditional gauges. For the heavy footed, sport mode stretches the tachometer across the top of the display, allowing it to blossom into fiery orange when a driver\u2019s hammering it. For the track types, the full racing display includes a lap timer. Ford hopes details like these will showcase the Mustang\u2019s pedigree. Check it out in the video above. One day, it\u2019s likely your car will drive itself, and the screens inside will be more useful for watching Netflix than displaying driving data. Until then, just hope designers keep exploring ways to enhance your view of the road ahead.

Countries and municipalities like the United Kingdom, Norway, France, the Netherlands, India, and China have all made a similar pledge: They're going to kick their gasoline-powered car habit in the next few decades. It is a nice idea, maybe even a world-saving one. The transportation sector accounts for 14 percent of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, which humanity must cut by 40 to 70 percent by 2050 to prevent that disastrous 2-degree Celsius temperature hike. Which explains why the state of California is shouting Me too! \u201cI\u2019ve gotten messages from the governor asking, \u2018Why haven\u2019t we done something already?\u2019\u201d Mary Nichols, head of the California Air Resources Board, told Bloomberg last week. \"The governor has certainly indicated an interest in why China can do this and not California.\" She said a California ban on the sale of non-electric vehicles is at least a decade away. Just one little problem. \u201cThere is not, in any of these places, policy follow-up to ensure that these goals are met,\u201d says Nic Lutsey, who studies electric vehicle policy at the International Council on Clean Transportation. No plans, no blueprints, no teeth. These pronouncements are the governmental equivalent of pledging to drop 100 pounds without considering details like diet or exercise. Sure, electric vehicles have come a ways in the last decade. They're quick. Some of them are cool. Thanks to fast-improving battery tech and charging infrastructure, they can go further and to more places than ever before. Even legacy carmakers like General Motors, Ford, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover are joining the faithful (Tesla, Nissan) in the burgeoning EV market. But EVs are still just a bitty fraction of vehicles sold worldwide\u20144.3 percent in 2016. Charging infrastructure is spreading, but it's far from everywhere. And even mass market EVs aren't cheap. Still, pay attention. \u201cThe announcements are hugely important,\u201d says Nic Lutsey, who studies electric vehicle policy at the International Council on Clean Transportation. \u201cThey show what governments are thinking and what all their research groups are telling them: that to clean up transportation, to avoid the worst climate change impact, they will need to electrify the fleet. It\u2019s showing that a consensus is clearly emerging.\u201d The positive news for countries, states, cities, and any other jurisdiction looking to boot the polluters? There is a way forward. The long road to electro-bliss is paved with incentivizing nudges from local governments, international coordination with carmakers; hard-hitting, quota-filled national programs, and a heaping spoonful of consumer education. And the work starts now. Today Electric cars may be more expensive than their gas-powered counterparts, but governments around the world have found combinations of carrots and sticks to convince their citizens to go with the plug. In the Bugs Bunny snack category, Norway\u2019s electric vehicle owners dodge municipal parking charges, purchase and import taxes, and tunnel and ferry fees\u2014a serious money-saver in a nation streaked with fjords. They can charge or refuel their electric and hydrogen cars for free. They get to drive in bus-only lanes. Ha det bra , traffic! The result: More than a quarter of the vehicles sold in Oslo each year are electric. This investment in the future has its cost, of course. \u201cThe foregoing of the sales tax of EVs costs Norway a lot of money, but furthered their goals of making them the electric vehicles leaders of the world,\u201d says Costa Samaras, who studies alternative energy at Carnegie Mellon University. In Shanghai, where 11 percent of 2015 new vehicle sales were electric, buyers receive a $4,400 purchase subsidy. But the biggest money-saver kicks in after the trip to the dealer. To restrict the number of cars on the road, the local government auctions off license plates to the highest bidders; they can fetch as much as $12,000. Electric vehicles get to dodge these auctions, saving their owners big bucks. For a taste of the stick, look to London. Come 2020, a central swath of the British capital will form an \"ultra low emission zone.\" Any vehicle that wants in and doesn't meet stringent emission standards will face a daily charge. (License plate-reading cameras will ensure all wheeled things are in compliance.) Shanghai has a similar plan in place that applies to commercial vehicles. Finally, places like California hoping to goose electric sales ahead of a gas ban could look to \u2026 California, which is ramping up the charging infrastructure that makes EV ownership feasible. \u201cMoney is not the only reason people are not buying electric vehicles today,\u201d says Lutsey. \u201cThere\u2019s also the convenience.\u201d San Jose, the humming heart of Silicon Valley, is already the fifth most charged-up city in the world, with 500 charge points per million people. San Francisco has about 450 per million. Good, but not good enough. Fortunately, California has a $800 million electric charging windfall coming its way, in the form of a settlement with Volkswagen over its diesel emissions cheating scandal . The money goes straight to the coffers of the California Air Resources Board, which will spread the money out over the next 10 years. Slowly but surely, it should get easier to own an electric vehicle in California. And that makes it easier for California to ban gasoline for good. Tomorrow Baby steps today are necessary, but they don't get you out of the long-term work a gas ban requires. China is on the right track. Last week, the world's largest auto market\u2014where a third of all EVs sold last year found their owners\u2014rolled out a much-anticipated electric vehicle plan . The scheme pushes an aggressive cap-and-trade-like policy that will force foreign and domestic carmakers to up the number of zero- and low-emission vehicles they produce by 2020. (The plan, it should be noted, looks like California\u2019s own ZEV scheme, which forces automakers to build electric models or purchase credits from those doing so.) These policies are producing results. This week, General Motors announced it would build at least 20 new fully electric vehicle models by 2023, and eventually phase of non-electric vehicles. Volvo is going (mostly) electric . BMW, too . No big automaker can afford to lose access to such lucrative markets. Way Down the Line The trickiest part of pulling off this sort of move is doing it without hurting your most vulnerable citizens. In this case, those are the low-income, largely rural folks who rely on the affordability of the internal combustion engine to get them to their jobs, their grocery stores, their community centers. It takes a long time for innovations to trickle down to the country\u2019s poorest households. \u201cBanning sure could increase the number of electric vehicles on the road, but would sure come at another cost,\u201d says Samaras. \u201cWe need to make sure mobility and access at lower income population could be improved.\u201d That means investment in public transportation. A lot of it. Also, consumer education for the folks who know nothing about what driving an electric car entails. Annoyingly, there's no easy answer for that. \"There\u2019s a huge diversity of car buyers,\u201d says Lutsey. \u201cTrying to meet every consumer\u2019s demand is incredibly difficult. You need a car that\u2019s the right brand, the right reputation, the right cost point, the right convenience.\u201d Maybe that's why no other American states or government agencies have floated gas car bans. But do not count out California, which has a long history of leading on emissions. As federal legislators tussled over the 1963 Clean Air Act, they wrote in provisions allowing the state to create its own stricter regulations, acknowledging it was already way out ahead on environmental standards. Nine other states have signed onto California's Zero Emission Vehicle mandate, which means the it controls over a quarter of the American vehicle market. Even if California can't receive a special waiver from the federal government to ban gas, the state seems to think it can pull it off by manipulating vehicle registration rules or ordering gas vehicles off state highways. Still, more ideas are needed. Banning fossil fuel gluggers isn\u2019t impossible. But moving them to zero is going to take a lot of strategery. And the game has just begun.

At the time, he was an architect at the design studio Gensler, and the cars were just a hobby\u2014a way to escape the real world obstacles inherent in designing buildings. \u201cWith architecture, it gets to the point where you\u2019re spending this much time on other things,\u201d he says stretching his arms wide, \u201cand this much time on design.\u201d The cars, on the other hand, were pure design. Dragusin, who now creates them full-time for his company Candylab Toys, had a soft spot for the boxy muscle cars of the 1960s and \u201870s with their clean, blunt lines and bold colors. \u201cSee how simple these are?\u201d he says pointing to a wooden car modeled after a Pontiac Firebird. \u201cThey\u2019re just simple wooden blocks.\u201d Dragusin and his team spent the first four years of Candylab making variations of those muscle cars with an Airstream or tow truck thrown in. And then they hit a wall. \u201cWe knew we were going to do something different period-wise,\u201d he says. \u201cWe developed [the muscle cars] as much as we could before it gets repetitive.\u201d The company\u2019s new line of cars, called The Outlaws , is modeled after prohibition-era hot rods that have been souped up and redesigned for modern day. The automobiles, which vaguely echo Rat Rod car culture, are curvier than Candylab earlier designs, with an elongated body that tapers at the front and wheels that jut out. It\u2019s speedy shape is harder to engineer than the typical muscle car, Dragusin explains. Typically, a hot rod silhouette would be made from an injection molded plastic. But Candylab's new line is made by shaving the wood on a router table to get a precise, compound curve. \u201cIt\u2019s like sculpting,\u201d Dragusin says. \u201cYou can only subtract with wood.\u201d By limiting itself to a single material for the body, Candylab loses some of the detail found on other toy cars. Instead of accessories, Candylab\u2019s cars are defined by their overall shape. \u201cFor cars, silhouette is really powerful,\u201d says Kaeo Helder, a designer at Candylab. Working with Dragusin, Helder looks at a model of a real car and then peels back as much detail as possible until they get to the essence of the form. Most of the time, this leaves them with a simple silhouette that echoes the original. In the new line, all of the cars except for the tow truck use the same basic body shape. It\u2019s a way to optimize manufacturing and give the line a cohesive identity. Cleverly, the team distinguishes the cars by flipping their wooden bodies upside down, moving the cab toward the front or back of the car, or painting on additional details like taillights. \u201cEssentially we're doing the exact same thing they [Rat Rod makers] did,\u201d says Helder. \u201cYou chop it up, combine it, and and see what happens.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "candylab", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vlad dragusin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gensler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dragusin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaeo helder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "candylab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "candylab toys", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "candylab", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:12:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "022fd02be2741b9f3db577922376e9143d30c728", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjIDkAGY.Jp7SY89oIarVmBq2Kzx2AXvdkO9f6v6Soul_J5ty_2Psg2D5fhEX_gQt1vhp1EklrsA--", "site_full": "www.wired.com", "site": "wired.com", "site_section": "http://www.wired.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Feed: All Latest", "title": "Cardi B's Billboard Reign Isn't a Fluke\u2014It's Streaming Supremacy", "title_full": "Cardi B's Billboard Reign Isn't a Fluke\u2014It's Streaming Supremacy", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/59d2931ab5f3330763e26446/191:100/pass/Cardi-B-feature-art-835714196.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 859, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 97, "comments": 0, "shares": 97}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 8}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "022fd02be2741b9f3db577922376e9143d30c728", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjIDkAGY.Jp7SY89oIarVmBq2Kzx2AXvdkO9f6v6Soul_J5ty_2Psg2D5fhEX_gQt1vhp1EklrsA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jason Parham", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cardi B's Billboard Reign Isn't a Fluke\u2014It's Streaming Supremacy", "text": "Cardi B's Billboard Reign Isn't a Fluke\u2014It's Streaming Supremacy Paras Griffin/Getty Images Cardi B has never lacked clarity. In 2015, as a recent addition to the New York cast of VH1\u2019s reality show Love & Hip Hop , she uploaded a video to Instagram\u2014a sneakily inspiring clip that teemed with vulnerability and candor and Bronx bite. \u201cMy manager been having me take media training class for interviews,\u201d she says to the camera in the clip, \u201cand you know what? I be on some \u2018fuck that\u2019 shit because I want to talk on the level that people can relate to me. I don\u2019t give a fuck if y\u2019all like me or not. I\u2019m not gonna be fake.\u201d The rise of the 24-year-old rapper born Belcalis Almanzar in the two years since has proven to be anything but fabricated. After masterminding social media fame into an indelible, if short-lived, reality TV stint, she moved on to a rap career that\u2019s all the more stunning for its nascence: Last week she became the first female rapper since Lauryn Hill (and only the second in history) to top the Billboard Hot 100 without a guest feature. The song that earned Cardi the crown was \u201cBodak Yellow (Money Moves),\u201d a modern Cinderella tale of brash resolve (part of the song\u2019s structure is modeled after Kodak Black\u2019s \u201cNo Flockin\u2019\u201d ). Haughty and magnetic, it\u2019s a song preoccupied with its own success, and its climactic placement atop the charts not only fulfills Cardi\u2019s prophesy but heralds a permanent shift in the calculus of pop power. In form and function, \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d is a quintessential New York City summer anthem, mined of the same ore that produced Bobby Shmurda\u2019s \u201cHot Nigga\u201d and Young M.A\u2019s \u201cOoouuu\u201d in recent years. But NYC summer anthems don\u2019t typically reach the Billboard Hot 100. \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d was \u201cslightly more aspirational and accessible\u201d than its predecessors\u2014\u201cperfect for yelling along in a party, on a highway, or in an Instagram caption,\u201d says Rawiya Kameir, deputy editor of the Fader, who has profiled Cardi B twice since 2016. Even more importantly, she says, the song shares an odd quality with successful pop songs: \u201cIt\u2019s just familiar enough to catch your ear, but just off-kilter enough to stick there.\u201d Today, a song like \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d has a new avenue by which it can attain chart dominance: streaming playlists. \u201cStreaming platforms have democratized chart positioning,\u201d says Carl Chery, head of artist curation for Apple Music. In 2014, Billboard began incorporating data from music streaming services as well as individual track sales, including platforms such as Spotify, Google Play, and Apple Music. Chery recognized the fervor in \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d early on; the week after its June release, he featured it on the A-List: Hip-Hop playlist, which is among the most popular on the service. Song play spiked 124% in that first week and, according to the company, \"Bodak Yellow\" has remained on its Trending Songs report ever since. Its run on Spotify is equally impressive: it has racked up 96 million streams to date, weighting the Billboard odds in its favor. But the overperformance of \"Bodak Yellow\" isn\u2019t as simple as a regional hit gone mainstream. Like a youthful Cassius Clay going toe-to-toe with the seemingly invincible heavyweight champ Sonny Liston in 1964, Cardi was up against megastar Taylor Swift\u2019s rancorous \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d a release that carries with it the punch of a built-in massive audience that nearly always guarantees artists like Swift top billing. Still, that was just to get to the top; \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d managed to maintain its positioning a second week by fending off not just Swift, but another streaming insurgent, Post Malone\u2019s \u201cRockstar.\u201d Pop ubiquity often comes with rules\u2014and Cardi has done away with many of them altogether. If Swift\u2019s public persona is one of manufactured constraint and small-town purity, Cardi B has taken the opposite approach: she\u2019s a constant and commanding presence on Instagram (she\u2019ll often upload videos of family life from her grandmother\u2019s residence in Washington Heights) and speaks with such unvarnished openness that she once confessed how, when traveling out of town, she carries a razor blade between her butt cheeks for protection. By merely being herself, Cardi B has unknowingly and unintentionally mastered what writer and researcher Nehal El-Hadi termed \u201ca production of presence\" \u2014and her counternarrative is profoundly felt among fans. By merely being herself, she has unknowingly and unintentionally mastered what writer and researcher Nehal El-Hadi termed \u201c a production of presence \u201d\u2014which is \u201cthe creation, management, and distribution of content and stories that center the marginalized individual and reflect the being-in-the-world of marginalized groups in deliberately authentic and representative ways.\u201d Not surprisingly, Cardi B\u2019s counternarrative is profoundly felt among fans: Affectionately known as the #BardiGang, they have helped to translate Cardi\u2019s relatability into chart success. The triumph of \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d Chery says, was about more than the song alone: \u201cHer rags to riches story is well documented. We\u2019re all rooting for her\u2014she\u2019s the people\u2019s champ.\u201d The ascent of \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d also signals another reality: that albums are beginning to matter less and less. Consider songs that share a similar trajectory, Rae Sremmurd\u2019s \u201cBlack Beatles\u201d and Migos\u2019 \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d\u2014tracks that accrued an incredible amount of viral currency and nearly eclipsed each group\u2019s respective album (both songs peaked at number one on the Hot 100). They weren\u2019t just songs; like \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d they were moments. But also consider the state of the music industry. If playlists have heightened our investment in a song-based economy, and a song like \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d has given new meaning to chart relevance and granted Cardi a place in history, then maybe albums don\u2019t matter anymore. (Even Drake was insistent about labeling More Life a playlist, not an album). There is power in the playlist \u2014which is to say there is power in the song. Whether or not albums will lose relevance in the years ahead, Chery is unshakable about one fact: as streaming services expand, songs will become hits even faster. He points to Post Malone, whose 21 Savage-assisted \u201cRockstar\u201dshattered Apple Music\u2019s record for single-week streams by amassing more than 25 million times and debuted at number two on the Hot 100. (On Spotify, the song has amassed 105 million streams since its release.) Coupled with \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d its rise confirms an inevitable shift: artists may continue to release albums, and radio may continue to play singles, but for the foreseeable future, streaming performance will largely dictate who governs the top of the charts.

Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) project The way the Nobel Committee tells it, the story of this year\u2019s physics prize begins like a certain 1970s space opera. \u201cOnce upon a time, a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, two massive black holes engaged in a deadly dance,\u201d said physicist and Nobel committee member Olga Botner at today's prize announcement. The pair spiraled toward each other, colliding to form an even bigger black hole with a mass 62 times that of Earth's sun. The impact shook the universe, generating ripples known as gravitational waves that warped the fabric of spacetime as they pulsed through. By the time the collision's reverberations reached Earth, they had quieted to a quiver. Some 1.3 billion years after that ferocious black hole do-si-do, physicists at two observatories in the US simultaneously detected a ripple as a tiny compression and expansion in length in their machines. This first detection of a gravitational wave took four decades of calculations, simulations, and engineering\u2014and more than a billion dollars of US taxpayer money. Today, physicists Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish, and Kip Thorne won the Nobel Prize in Physics for the pioneering work that led to this discovery. They\u2019ll split 9 million Swedish krona in prize money, or 1.1 million dollars; Weiss will receive half the prize while Barish and Thorne will split the other half. I see this more as a thing that recognizes the work of about 1,000 people. Rainer Weiss Weiss and Thorne began to search for gravitational waves back in the '70s, 50 years after Albert Einstein first predicted their existence in his theory of general relativity. No one had seen a gravitational wave yet, so it was possible that Einstein had gotten some of his theory wrong. Weiss, working at MIT, and Thorne, at Caltech, developed prototypes of a laser interferometer \u2014a machine that could measure minuscule fluctuations in length. Weiss brought the craftsmanship and engineering, while Thorne specialized in theoretical calculations. Their designs led to machines that could detect compressions in spacetime thousands of times smaller than the width of a proton. The descendants of those prototypes, one located in Louisiana and the other in Washington, detected the first gravitational wave in 2015 . But a sophisticated machine is only as clever as its operators. The Nobel Committee credits Barish, a physicist at Caltech, for assembling and managing the team\u2014the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory collaboration\u2014that made the discovery. When Barish became LIGO's leader in 1994, he expanded the group from about 40 researchers to more than a thousand people from all over the world. He gathered experts specializing in black holes, gravity, lasers, statistics, vacuum systems, and everything else that goes into a giant, L-shaped observatory that can measure tiny contractions in its two 2.5-mile-long arms.

NISHANT CHOKSI In, say, a customer service chat window, what\u2019s the polite way to ask whether I\u2019m talking to a human or a robot? Back in June 2006, before any of us needed to worry about whether we were talking to a robot in our daily interactions, it was up to contemporary artists to make people feel vulnerable and confused. That month a friend invited me to see the preview of an exhibit by the artist Matthew Barney at a museum in San Francisco. (Barney is probably best known for making a series of films called the Cremaster Cycle , named after the muscle that raises and lowers the testes, and also for having a child with Bj\u00f6rk.) Regarding the exhibit I\u2019d been invited to, one critic wrote that, while everyone should go see the show, \u201cno one should anticipate enjoying it.\u201d Frankly, I didn\u2019t enjoy it. Not being much of an art person, I didn\u2019t even understand it. I remember a sprawl of chicken-scratch on a very high wall and a painfully slow film set on a surrealistic whaling vessel. And I remember something that happened that night, something that raised an equally disorienting set of questions about ethics, not aesthetics, that I\u2019d like to try to unpack now, after all these years. One room of the museum had been overtaken by a tangled, plasticized, 3-D form\u2014a \u201csculpture,\u201d I suppose you\u2019d call it. We, the viewers, mingled at its edges, stepping around where its lowest tentacles reached the floor. I heard a deafening thwack. Everyone turned around. A man had collided with one particularly disordered region of the sculpture. People naturally began scanning for damage. But, given all the complexities of this great, bulbous sculpture, it was impossible to tell: Had some of those white bits broken off, or had they always been on the ground like that? I\u2019ll never forget the silence that filled that room, as though the air between us petrified into a solid. And then everyone turned away, pretending nothing had happened\u2014just turned our backs on the guy, freezing him out and, no doubt, adding to his mortification. No one even had the courage to ask if he was OK. That moment often comes back to me. It was a peculiarly fraught situation, which seemed to expose some latent discomfort around modern art\u2014even there, at a modern art museum. Presumably everyone was trying to be polite\u2014I know I was\u2014but didn\u2019t see an obvious or safe way to respond. And so, rather than risk impoliteness, we shut down; we turned away. And that wasn\u2019t polite. I think it was cowardly. I know what it\u2019s like to wonder if the intelligence on the other side of the internet is artificial or human. It\u2019s profoundly unnerving; I worry, on some level, that I\u2019m being hoodwinked, which, I hate to say, is also how I feel when I look at some modern art. And I\u2019m tempted to behave in ways\u2014tersely, snidely, with a muted but unmistakable F.U. undertone\u2014that I\u2019d hate for an actual person, if it were an actual person, to have to endure. What\u2019s the polite way to ask if you\u2019re talking to a robot? Well, I think it involves turning toward those feelings of vulnerability instead of away from them. It requires making some kind of confession, an admission of how perplexed and clumsy you feel, as a well-meaning person, sitting here in this chat window, nursing a potentially rude question about the entity on the other end. In short, it requires a gesture of our own humanity while asking for confirmation of theirs. So, next time you squirm in one of those customer service chats, I suggest you take a moment to describe where you are and the disorientation you feel\u2014I\u2019m sitting at my kitchen table, fidgeting in front of my laptop because these interactions always make me uncomfortable\u2014then simply say, \u201cThere\u2019s no perfect way to ask this, but: Are you a human being? I sure hope so. Because I\u2019m a human being, and I need some help.\u201d Write to mrknowitall@wired.com. This article appears in the October issue. Subscribe now .

Here's What Came Before It In the 1970s, British inventor Kane Kramer developed the schematics for a portable digital music player. Kane Kramer On January 9, 2007, Steve Jobs stood on the MacWorld stage in his jeans and a black turtleneck. \u201cEvery once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything,\u201d he declared. \u201cToday, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.\u201d The Runaway Species: How Human Creativity Remakes the World , by Anthony Brandt & David Eagleman catapult Even after years of speculation, the iPhone was a revelation. No one had seen anything like it: here was a communication device, music player, and personal computer that you could hold in the palm of your hand. The media hailed it as trailblazing, almost magical. Bloggers called it the \u201cJesus phone.\u201d The introduction of the iPhone was characteristic of great innovations: they come at us unexpectedly, with novelty that seems to have come from nowhere. But, despite appearances, innovations don\u2019t come from nowhere. They are the latest branches on the family tree of invention. Research scientist Bill Buxton has curated a collection of technological devices for decades, and he can lay out the long genealogy of DNA that has forged a path to our modern gadgets. Consider the Casio AT-550-7 wristwatch from 1984: it featured a touchscreen that allowed the user to finger-swipe digits directly onto the watch face. Ten years later\u2014and still thirteen years before the iPhone\u2014IBM added a touchscreen to a mobile phone. The Simon was the world\u2019s first smart phone: it used a stylus and had a collection of basic apps. It was able to send and receive faxes and emails, and had a world time clock, notepad, calendar, and predictive typing. Unfortunately, not many people bought it. Why did the Simon die? In part because the battery lasted only one hour, in part because mobile phone calls were so expensive at the time, and in part because there was no ecosystem of apps to draw upon. But just like the Casio touchscreen, Simon left its genetic material in the iPhone that followed \u201cfrom nowhere.\u201d Twenty-two years after Kramer\u2019s idea, Apple debuted the iPod. Kane Kramer Four years after the Simon came the Data Rover 840 , a personal digital assistant that had a touchscreen navigated in 3-D by a stylus. Contact lists could be stored on a memory chip and carried around anywhere. Mobile computing was gaining its footing. Looking through his collection, Buxton points to the many devices that paved the way for the electronics industry. The 1999 Palm Vx introduced the thinness we\u2019ve come to expect in our devices today. \u201cIt produced the vocabulary that led to the super thin stuff like today\u2019s laptops,\u201d Buxton says. \u201cWhere are the roots? There they are, right there.\u201d Step by step, the groundwork was being laid for Steve Jobs\u2019 \u201crevolutionary\u201d product. The Jesus phone didn\u2019t come from a virgin birth after all. A few years after Jobs\u2019 announcement, the writer Steve Cichon bought a stack of timeworn Buffalo News newspapers from 1991. He wanted to satisfy his curiosity about what had changed. In the front section, he found this Radio Shack advertisement. Steve Cichon/Buffalo Stories archives Cichon had a revelation: every item on the page had been replaced by the iPhone in his pocket. Just two decades earlier, a buyer would have spent $3,054.82 for all this hardware; they were now taken care of by a five-ounce device at a fraction of the cost and material. The ad was a picture of the iPhone\u2019s genealogy. Groundbreaking technologies don\u2019t appear from nowhere\u2014they result from inventors \u201criffing on the best ideas of their heroes,\u201d as Buxton observes. He likens Jonathan Ive, the designer of the iPhone, to a musician such as Jimi Hendrix, who often \u201cquoted\u201d other musicians in his compositions. \u201cIf you know the history and pay attention to it, you appreciate Jimi Hendrix all the more,\u201d Buxton says. In a similar vein, science historian Jon Gertner writes: We usually imagine that invention occurs in a flash, with a eureka moment that leads an inventor towards a startling epiphany. In truth, large leaps forward in technology rarely have a precise point of origin. At the start, forces that precede an invention merely begin to align, often imperceptibly, as a group of people or ideas converge, until over the course of months or years (or decades) they gain clarity and momentum and the help of additional ideas and actors. about the authors Anthony Brandt is a composer and professor at Rice University\u2019s Shepherd School of Music. David Eagleman is a neuroscientist and the New York Times bestselling author of Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain. He is the writer and host of the Emmy-nominated PBS television series The Brain . Like diamonds, creativity results from pressing history into brilliant new forms. Consider another of Apple\u2019s breakthroughs: the iPod. In the 1970s, piracy was a major issue in the record industry. Retailers could return unsold albums to a record company for a refund; many took advantage of this to send back counterfeit copies instead. In one case, two million copies of Olivia Newton-John\u2019s album Physical were printed, and in spite of the album topping the charts, an astounding three million copies were returned. To stop the rampant fraud, British inventor Kane Kramer came up with an idea. He would develop a method to transmit music digitally across phone lines, and an in-store machine would custom-print each album. But then it occurred to Kramer that a cumbersome machine might be an unnecessary step. Instead of producing an analog record, why not keep the music digital and design a portable machine that could play it? He developed the schematics for a portable digital music player, the IXI . It had a display screen and buttons for playing the tracks. Bill Buxton Kramer not only designed the player, he foresaw a whole new way of selling and sharing digital music with unlimited inventory and no need for warehouses. Paul McCartney was one of his first investors. The main drawback of Kramer\u2019s music player was that, given the hardware available at the time, it only had enough memory to hold one song. Seizing on Kramer\u2019s promising idea, Apple Computer\u2019s engineers incorporated a scroll wheel, sleeker materials, and, of course, more advanced memory and software. In 2001\u2014twenty-two years after Kramer\u2019s idea\u2014they debuted the iPod. Steve Jobs would later say: Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn\u2019t really do it. They just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while; that\u2019s because they were able to connect experiences they\u2019ve had and synthesize new things. Catapult Kramer\u2019s idea did not come out of nowhere, either. It followed in the footsteps of the Sony Walkman , a portable cassette player. The Walkman was made possible by the invention of the cassette tape in 1963, which was itself made possible by reel-to-reel tapes in 1924, and so on back through history, everything emerging from the ecosystem of innovations before it. Human creativity does not emerge from a vacuum. We draw on our experience and the raw materials around us to refashion the world. Knowing where we\u2019ve been, and where we are, points the way to the next big industries. From studying his collection of gadgets, Buxton concludes that two decades typically pass before a new concept dominates in the marketplace. \u201cIf what I said is credible,\u201d he told the Atlantic magazine, \u201cthen it is equally credible that anything that is going to become a billion dollar industry in the next ten years is already ten years old. That completely changes how we should approach innovation.

RAMIN RAHIMIAN/The New York Times/Redux The blockbuster legal battle between Uber and Google\u2019s self-driving spinoff company, Waymo, hinges on two questions. One: Did former Google engineer and self\u2013driving car whiz Anthony Levandowski swipe documents containing valuable Google intellectual property and bring them to his own startup, which would be acquired by Uber just months later for a reported $680 million? And two: Did Uber executives, including now-ousted CEO Travis Kalanick, conspire with Levandowski to do it, then use that intellectual property to advance their own technology? Now a hotly contested due diligence report, commissioned by Uber, makes it clear that the ride-hailing company knew Levandowski had ill-gotten Google files before it bought his startup and put him in charge of its own self-driving efforts. Question one seems to have its answer, and question two just got a lot more interesting. The firm Stroz Friedberg prepared the report, which Uber used to prep for its 2016 acquisition of Otto, Levandowski\u2019s company focused on self\u2013driving truck technology. Waymo's attorneys filed the report as an exhibit in the case on Monday night, making it public. Since Waymo filed its suit in February, Uber's battle stance has been: Whatever Levandowski did, we had no part in it. Any stolen files never made it onto our servers or into our cars. No one here used that information to inform how we're developing our own technology. The due diligence report indicates that Uber\u2019s investigators knew Levandowski had possession of thousands of files related to the Google self\u2013driving car project at least two months after he left the company. The report finds the engineer had access to Google self-driving project design files, source code, laser details, emails, presentations, software, and photos of Google tech and computer screens on his personal laptop, in a Dropbox account that he had used while at the company, and on a set of five disks. But Levandowski had deleted or destroyed many of the files by the time he met with Uber\u2019s investigators, even emptying his computer\u2019s trash while inside the law firm\u2019s offices. Whether Levandowski conspired with Uber officials to take those documents is still an open question. The report reveals evidence of conversations with Uber executives about working together\u2014a full six months before he left Google in January 2016. At one point, Levandowski asked then-Uber executive Brian McClendon what his company would be willing to pay for the entire Google self-driving staff. (Levandowski said he was trying to pin down a market value for the team.) Levandowski told Uber\u2019s investigators that he and Kalanick exchanged more than 200 text messages during this period. Through Waymo, Google is suing Uber for stealing a raft of self\u2013driving car trade secrets and patents, including information on lidar, a sensor that will help autonomous vehicles \u201csee\u201d the world around them. The search giant says that Levandowski stole thousands of documents when he left Google as part of a plan to bring those patents and trade secrets to Uber and use them to jump-start Uber's own self\u2013driving car project. The suit demands Uber pay at least $1.9 billion in damages. Uber had used every legal maneuver and appeal it could muster to keep the 34-page report out of Waymo\u2019s hands. But on Monday, an Uber spokesperson said the embattled company was \u201cpleased\u201d the due diligence report had been made public. It \u201chelps explain why\u2014even after 60 hours of inspection of our facilities, source code, documents, and computer\u2014no Google material has been found at Uber,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. If you\u2019re still feeling a bit mystified about how and why Levandowski left Google and finally made his way to Uber, know that you are not alone. Levandowski has refused to answer questions, asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Federal District Judge William Alsup has taken the rare step of referring the case to federal prosecutors to determine whether criminal charges against Levandowski, Kalanick, Uber, and others are warranted. Uber fired Levandowski in May , saying he wasn't cooperating with its legal efforts. Uber's report makes it clear that Levandowski aggressively recruited for his startup while working at Google. He held one-on-one meetings with more than 20 Google employees at the company\u2019s offices, at recruits' homes, and in coffee shops. At the end of 2015 and in early 2016, he held four recruiting meetings at barbecues at his house and on a ski trip to Lake Tahoe. (A number of Google employees were invited to these soirees through their work email addresses.) Levandowski told Uber\u2019s investigators that his startup made employment offers to at least 15 Google employees before and after his departure from the company. By mid-March 2016, Otto had 30 employees, 16 of whom were former Google workers. More curious is the business with Levandowski\u2019s five disks, which contained, the report says, proprietary information. The engineer told Uber investigators that he discovered the disks inside a closet sometime just after he suddenly resigned from Google. By Levandowski\u2019s retelling, he immediately informed his attorney about the disks and alerted Uber\u2019s top brass. An Uber executive told Levandowski to preserve the disks for record-keeping purposes, but by the time he met with Stroz investigators, Levandowski said he had taken them to an Oakland shredding facility to be destroyed. The subsequent investigation did not turn up any hard evidence that the shredding facility destroyed the five disks but suggested that if it did, it only happened three days after Levandowski met with investigators. Waymo\u2019s legal team is touting the report\u2019s revelations as a victory. \u201cKnowing all this, Uber paid $680 million for Mr. Levandowski\u2019s company, protected him from legal action, and installed him as the head of their self-driving vehicle program,\u201d a Waymo spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThis report raises significant questions and justifies careful review.\" The team has used the report to ask Judge Alsup for a delayed trial, which would give the company more time to review the document and others recently released by Uber. But the company still hasn\u2019t firmly linked Uber to the stolen files\u2014that\u2019s that pesky question two. Waymo will need to prove that Levandowski\u2019s information made it into Uber self-driving tech, or that the ride-hailing giant was negligent enough to make that leakage possible. \u201cSo far you don\u2019t have any smoking gun,\u201d Judge Alsup told the company's lawyers in May. That was thousands and thousands of documents ago. Waymo\u2019s team has promised there are bombshells to be revealed, but for now, the air in the courtroom looks pretty clear.

They\u2019ll Feel Different TONY TETHER (Darpa): I thought, \u201cHell, maybe we\u2019ll get five or 10 people to show up.\u201d JOSE NEGRON (Darpa): The defense contractors that Darpa had been working with, they got stuck in a mind meld. They were thinking step by step, evolutionary, and they weren\u2019t progressing. So we needed a revolutionary approach, a leap forward, and I kept telling Tony there would be hundreds of people interested in joining us, people who do not do DOD business. People who work late at night, in their garages and bedrooms, because they love what they do. For them, failure is OK as long as they learn something. But he didn\u2019t believe me until he arrived at the Petersen for the kickoff. TETHER: We were going to open the doors at 9 in the morning, and by the time I got there at 8:30 there was a line of people four abreast going all the way around the block. These were just ordinary people who dreamed of having a car that was driverless. NEGRON: I told them this was gonna be a 142-mile challenge, in the desert. You\u2019ll be going through switchbacks, up and down, paths as narrow as 10 feet, and the vehicle\u2019s gonna have to sense its way through the course. They had a year to figure it out. One guy asked, \u201cWhy are you making the race so hard?\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it the Grand Challenge.\u201d TETHER: Before all this, Darpa\u2019s self-driving programs were working to minimize human intervention. That was the wrong criteria. We were trying to get it so a human never has to be involved. JOSEPH BEBEL (Team Palos Verdes High School): My mom is an engineer and heard about the challenge. I was looking for new and interesting things to work on, so we brought the challenge to my high school as an extracurricular project. DAVID HALL (Team DAD\u2014Digital Auto Drive): We were appearing on BattleBots and Robot Wars around that time, which was mostly an excuse for advertising our Velodyne loudspeaker. Then, when this Darpa thing came about, we jumped on it as an opportunity to show off some computer skills and do something fun. \nThe Slash X saloon in Barstow, California, was the meeting place for the race\u2019s qualifying vehicles. MELANIE DUMAS (Team Axion Racing): When we went to the Petersen event, we found an angel investor who gave us a bit of starter cash. We named our vehicle Spirit of Kosrae, for the island in Micronesia from which our investor was importing bottled water to sell. JIM MCBRIDE (Ford Engineer): At the time I was working on automotive safety at Ford, and when I heard about the race I volunteered to work at it to see how remote sensing had progressed and to see if there was anything that could be carried over into Ford\u2019s safety program. But most people thought that the notion of a car driving itself was for crackpots. SAL FISH (Course Designer): I get a phone call from a guy saying, \u201cI\u2019m with Darpa, and we\u2019re putting together an event with autonomous vehicles. Would you help us make a race course?\u201d I made the course. It had rocks on it, left turns, right turns, dips, gullies, cactus all around the place. A drop-off on one side and then 5 miles later a drop-off on the other side. Barbed wire fences, animals that could come out of nowhere, train tracks. Anything and everything that a vehicle would encounter going through the desert. NEGRON: I hired off-road champions to drive the route. To a man they said, \u201cThis is tough, even for us.\u201d TETHER: We got 106 team applications. We made them write technical papers, explaining what they were going to do. To cut it down, we\u2019d go visit them. One guy\u2019s wife came to the door and asked, \u201cAre you the guys who have got my husband trying to mortgage this house to build his car?\u201d BEBEL: The basic nature of the challenge was, follow the course they designed using GPS and sensors to avoid obstacles. We wanted to build something that, at least in theory, could complete the race. Our car was a pretty standard Acura SUV with a laser range-finding sensor on the front bumper. The laser created a one-dimensional picture of the road in front of you\u2014if there was an obstacle, it could tell you where it was. \nClockwise from top left: Axion Racing\u2019s Jeep Grand Cherokee; \u201cSandstorm,\u201d a stripped-down self-driving Humvee from Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Red Team; Team TerraMax\u2019s Oshkosh military truck; and Team Palos Verdes High School\u2019s Acura SUV, \u201cDoom Buggy.\u201d Alamy DUMAS: We had a Jeep Grand Cherokee, and we tried to keep it looking as normal as possible so that people wouldn\u2019t think autonomy was so futuristic or out of reach. We also put a couple of surfboards on the roof, just to stand out. We ran parallel sets of algorithms to guide the vehicle. One took GPS data, one took camera input, one took laser range-finding data, and they all fed into a voting system, which decided where the car was and where it needed to go. ALBERTO BROGGi (Team Terra\u00adMax): Our team specialized in machine vision, so we put three cameras on top of our vehicle\u2014a bright-green, 3-axle military truck\u2014along with two lidar sensors to spot obstacles ahead. CHRIS URMSON (Red Team, Carnegie Mellon): We realized that, at the speed we needed to drive to finish the race in time, our Humvee wouldn\u2019t be able to see that far ahead. So we gathered satellite imagery of the area. Whatever route Darpa gave us, we\u2019d use those maps to figure out the best path, and our Humvee would use laser sensing to see the shape of the road. TETHER: Anthony Levandowski was there, the fellow who\u2019s alleged to have taken data from Google to Uber. He had a self-balancing motorcycle. It did a great job in the qualifying rounds. NEGRON: Levandowski says motorcycles always win off-road races because of speed. And this was a speed event. That kid is a great engineer. He\u2019s in a slight bit of trouble now. [ Levandowski, the recently fired head of self-driving at Uber, declined to comment for this story .] II. The Race As race day approached, Darpa selected the 25 teams that had shown the most impressive progress and invited them to a qualifying round at California Speedway in Fontana, where they underwent safety inspections and technical tests. Fifteen teams performed well enough to advance. On March 13, 2004, the teams assembled in Barstow, two hours northeast of Los Angeles, to begin the 142-mile drive through California\u2019s Mojave Desert, to Primm, just over the Nevada border. FISH: We started at a saloon called the Slash X. A bloody shit-\u00adkicking, cowboy-type place. RED WHITTAKER (Red Team, Carnegie Mellon): It was a cold desert morning, and everything from a motorcycle to an Oshkosh giant military truck showed up. FISH: My God, these vehicles were something out of Mad Max . HALL: It was like being at Woodstock for nerds. NEGRON: Tony\u2019s idea was not to tell anybody where we were going until two hours before the event, then give them a CD with all the waypoints. TETHER: If we\u2019d given out the coordinates weeks before, someone could have gone out and run the course. This way, they had to prepare their vehicle for everything. It added a little mystique, too. WHITTAKER: We had a trailer, like a command center, and once we got the disc we went to work. Very quickly the vehicle team was running through everything from the fuel to the engine to the electronics, checking that everything was working. HALL: You drive your car up to the line and you hop out of it and press the button, and it goes off by itself. It\u2019s the damnedest thing you\u2019ve ever seen. WHITTAKER: Our vehicle, Sandstorm, was first off the line, so all that mattered was staying ahead. TETHER: I\u2019m sitting with this four-star general in the grandstand, and when Sandstorm goes off he just went, \u201cJesus.\u201d NEGRON: Sandstorm was doing 40 miles an hour. TETHER: It was really tough terrain. The start was pretty flat, then they had to go up a high hill, with a lot of switchbacks. NEGRON: The first few vehicles went out without a hitch. The back half of the field ... had some issues. DUMAS: Our Jeep Cherokee came out of the chute, and it made the first turn. And then on the second turn, it made a U-turn and headed back to the starting line. I think it saw the gate as too narrow, and the sensors decided to send the car back to where it came from. We made it 20 feet. That was a little devastating. TETHER: Levandowski\u2019s two-wheeler, he got so excited, he forgot to throw the switch for the stabilization and it fell right over. It was too bad. I thought it had a shot at being faster than the four-wheelers. But it didn\u2019t go a foot. Another little car went up a berm and flipped over. Another had a GPS problem\u2014it tried to go through a barbed wire fence and got tangled up. BEBEL: We\u2019d been having a problem with the steering on our Acura, which we called Doom Buggy, for weeks, and we couldn\u2019t test our final fix before the race. It failed, and Doom Buggy couldn\u2019t turn. The race officials let it run 50 yards or so until it hit the concrete sidewall. BROGGI: We put together all the Oshkosh\u2019s software at the last minute, and it couldn\u2019t discriminate between different types of obstacles. Our laser scanners picked out some brush and decided it was an unmovable obstacle. TETHER: The Oshkosh truck backed up, and it saw another tumbleweed in the back. So it just went back and forth. Fourteen tons, taken down by two tumbleweeds. BROGGI: We had no way to move around it. Almost a year of working on the project and we were finished in minutes. SEBASTIAN THRUN (Former head of Google\u2019s self-\u00addriving project): These vehicles didn\u2019t fail because they weren\u2019t rugged enough. They failed because they didn\u2019t take in enough environmental information. None of them saw anything. By the time the last of the 15 vehicles left the starting gate, the land around the Slash X saloon was a robotic graveyard. The race organizers and observers pinned their hopes on the four vehicles that were still driving an hour after departure, especially David Hall\u2019s Velodyne pickup and Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Sandstorm, last seen ripping through the desert flats and headed for the course\u2019s marquee challenge: a winding road up and over a steep hill called Daggett Ridge. HALL: There was this one hill you had to get over, at mile seven. And if you made it over that hill, it was absolutely straight, flat all the way to the finish line. FISH: I was going, \u201cMy God, they\u2019re gonna do it.\u201d WHITTAKER: The important thing that we had to avoid on that hill was going off-center. But a week before qualifying, we rolled our Humvee and damaged the sensors on our roof. It had the effect of the sensors looking a little right, and driving the vehicle a little left. TETHER: Sandstorm got straddled. WHITTAKER: We went a touch too far over the edge, and that\u2019s all it took. The tire just spun and spun until it burned. Smoke was pouring off of it. The race officials hit the emergency kill, and the race was over for Sandstorm. I thought, \u201cOh hell, it\u2019s a robot, I\u2019m not going to get emotional about it.\u201d I just made sure the team was OK, and I told them I appreciated the great thing they\u2019d just done. TETHER: We paused the race. David Hall\u2019s vehicle was about half a mile behind, still going. But when the race was paused, it rolled up against a rock. HALL: It was there for an hour or two while they were trying to get Sandstorm out of the way. We were back at our tent, waiting for information from them. We had no idea what the hell was happening. TETHER: We cleaned up the track and started Hall\u2019s car up again. HALL: When they started it back up again, it wouldn\u2019t jump over this rock underneath the front tire. TETHER: And that was the end of it. I got in the helicopter and flew to Primm, where all the TV crews were waiting to see the cars cross the finish line. It was 11 o\u2019clock in the morning, and they said, \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s over. One car went 7.4 miles, it started smoking, blah blah blah. It\u2019s over.\u201d A reporter asked, \u201cWell, what are you gonna do?\u201d I said, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna do it again, and this time it\u2019s going to be a $2 million prize.\u201d It was so successful and yet so not successful, I had to do it again. III. the Aftermath Despite the slap-stick failures of the first race, most of the participants\u2014and many onlookers\u2014saw the same possibilities that Tether saw when he announced the next race. TETHER: I was disappointed, but it was a spectacular thing, and the people involved understood\u2014this had never been done before. THRUN: None of what is happening in self-driving today would have happened without the original challenge\u2014it created a new community. They were all newcomers, and the innovation doesn\u2019t come from the core of the field itself but from the outside. The experts are usually the lowest performers, because they\u2019re totally bound in their way of thinking. Very few self-\u00addriving car people knew anything about machine learning at the time, for example. David Hall\u2019s Velodyne lidar development was triggered by the Grand Challenge. HALL: At the first challenge the sensors were all unreliable\u2014they would cause the vehicle to stop or veer off course. So a year after the first Grand Challenge, I started working on developing a new lidar sensor, with a bunch of lasers giving me a 360-degree, 3-D view. Darpa convinced me to build these sensors and sell them to the other teams for the third challenge. THRUN: Around 2008, Larry Page convinced me to build \u00adGoogle\u2019s self-driving car team. I met the best people in the field from the Darpa challenges. I hired Chris Urmson and Anthony Levandowski. URMSON: There was an incredible sense of camaraderie, and that community fostered the folks who are leading a lot of the technology today. TETHER: And that all comes from the fact that in 2004, some crazy-ass people decided to have a challenge. the oral historians, Then and Now Tony Tether Then: Director of Darpa (2001\u20132009) Now: Private technical consultant Then: CEO of Velodyne, a loudspeaker company Now: CEO of Velodyne, Now making lidar laser sensors Sal Fish Then: CEO of Score International, which organized desert races like the Baja 1000 Now: Retired Then: Robotics researcher at Carnegie Mellon Now: Same Then: Darpa\u2019s day-to-day manager for the Grand Challenge Now: Cyberwarfare consultant", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broggi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bebel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "negron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red team", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony levandowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "levandowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "urmson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim mcbride", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red whittaker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petersen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandstorm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose negron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph bebel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melanie dumas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry page", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sebastian thrun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberto broggi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dumas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris urmson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony tether", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thrun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris urmson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "whittaker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carnegie mellon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "darpa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "darpa challenge", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "acura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "team palos verdes high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dod", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oshkosh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u00adgoogle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robotics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carnegie mellon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "score international", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mojave desert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barstow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california speedway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fontana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kosrae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "micronesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "primm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daggett ridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woodstock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:40:46.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af5f0c90799dde2ffd9cbdfd779f2f68e0f6c7e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjIDkAGY.Jp7SY89oIarVmNJerSMeGAEl6OpZoHfFRvsEb2zIMuXSAguku9_Z37iTb5Z1DE7Homg--", "site_full": "www.wired.com", "site": "wired.com", "site_section": "http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Security Latest", "title": "6 Fresh Horrors From Equifax CEO Richard Smith's Congressional Hearing", "title_full": "6 Fresh Horrors From Equifax CEO Richard Smith's Congressional Hearing", "published": "2017-10-04T00:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/59d3ca77b59ada0f2985de0d/191:100/pass/EquifaxRichardSmith-HP-AP_17276549865698.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 859, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3450, "comments": 0, "shares": 3450}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1551}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af5f0c90799dde2ffd9cbdfd779f2f68e0f6c7e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjIDkAGY.Jp7SY89oIarVmNJerSMeGAEl6OpZoHfFRvsEb2zIMuXSAguku9_Z37iTb5Z1DE7Homg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lily Hay Newman", "published": "2017-10-04T00:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "6 Fresh Horrors From Equifax CEO Richard Smith's Congressional Hearing", "text": "05:22 pm 6 Fresh Horrors From the Equifax CEO's Congressional Hearing Richard Smith, former chair and CEO of Equifax, testifies before the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee on Capitol Hill. Carolyn Kaster/AP The initial drama over Equifax's September data breach has mostly subsided, but the actual damage will play out for years . And indeed, there turns out to be plenty of spectacle and public controversy left. It was all on display at a Tuesday Congressional hearing, in which lawmakers questioned Equifax's former CEO Richard Smith in an attempt to make sense of how things went so wrong. Before delving into the hearing itself\u2014which went poorly enough\u2014it's worth mentioning that it was bracketed by further unfortunate Equifax revelations. The company announced Monday that the total number of people impacted by its breach is not 143 million\u2014the amount it first disclosed\u2014but in fact 145.5 million. Its ability to casually misplace 2.5 million lives upended by the breach is alarming, as is Tuesday afternoon's revelation that the IRS awarded Equifax a no-bid, multimillion-dollar fraud-prevention contract last week. And there's a lot more where that came from. Here are six important (and astonishing, disappointing, you name it) tidbits that came out of Tuesday's hearing. 1. The timeline of when executives knew what about the breach is both disheartening and suspect. Equifax has previously said that it was breached on May 13 and that it first discovered the problem on July 29. The company notified the public on September 7. But during Tuesday's hearing, former CEO Smith added that he first heard about \"suspicious activity\" in a customer-dispute portal, where Equifax tracks customer complaints and efforts to correct mistakes in their credit reports, on July 31. He moved to hire cybersecurity experts from the law firm King & Spalding to start investigating the issue on August 2. Smith claimed that, at that time, there was no indication that any customer's personally identifying information had been compromised. As it turns out, after repeated questions from lawmakers, Smith admitted he never asked at the time whether PII being affected was even a possibility. Smith further testified that he didn't ask for a briefing about the \"suspicious activity\" until August 15, almost two weeks after the special investigation began and 18 days after the initial red flag. He received the briefing from King & Spalding and other forensic investigators on August 17. At that point, he said, those monitoring the situation had a better sense of the situation's severity. But Smith still staunchly maintains that he didn't have full information on August 17. \"I did not know the size, the scope of the breach,\" he told the committee. He finally notified the presiding director of Equifax's board on August 22, while the entire board of directors was briefed on August 24 and 25. \u201cThe picture was very fluid,\" Smith said. \"We were learning new pieces of information each and every day. As soon as we thought we had information that was of value to the board I reached out.\" Pretty leisurely timeline, no? There are still numerous outstanding questions, particularly about what Equifax general counsel John Kelly knew about the breach when he approved nearly $2 million in company stock sales for three executives at the beginning of August. But just these additional time stamps alone paint a picture of a severe lack of emergency protocol and general urgency. 2. Equifax's patching process was wholly inadequate. Attackers initially got into the affected customer-dispute portal through a vulnerability in the Apache Struts platform , an open-source web application service popular with corporate clients. Apache disclosed and patched the relevant vulnerability on March 6. In response to questions from representative Greg Walden of Oregon, Smith said there are two reasons the customer-dispute portal didn't receive that patch, known to be critical, in time to prevent the breach. The first excuse Smith gave was \"human error.\" He says there was a particular (unnamed) individual who knew that the portal needed to be patched but failed to notify the appropriate IT team. Second, Smith blamed a scanning system used to spot this sort of oversight that did not identify the customer-dispute portal as vulnerable. Smith said forensic investigators are still looking into why the scanner failed. 3. Equifax stored sensitive consumer information in plaintext rather than encrypt it. When asked by representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois about what data Equifax encrypts in its systems, Smith admitted that the data compromised in the customer-dispute portal was stored in plaintext and would have been easily readable by attackers. \"We use many techniques to protect data\u2014encryption, tokenization, masking, encryption in motion, encrypting at rest,\" Smith said. \"To be very specific, this data was not encrypted at rest.\" It\u2019s unclear exactly what of the pilfered data resided in the portal versus other parts of Equifax\u2019s system, but it turns out that also didn\u2019t matter much, given Equifax's attitude toward encryption overall. \u201cOK, so this wasn\u2019t [encrypted], but your core is?\u201d Kinzinger asked. \u201cSome, not all,\" Smith replied. \"There are varying levels of security techniques that the team deploys in different environments around the business.\" Great, great. 4. The recently resigned Equifax CEO only mandated security reviews every quarter. Toward the end of the hearing, Smith said he generally met with security and IT representatives once a quarter to review Equifax's security posture. Four meetings a year to defend hundreds of millions of people's crucial personal information gets you exactly the type of security posture Equifax had. 5. Equifax won't comment on, or rule out, nation-state attackers. There's no public evidence at all so far that a nation-state perpetrated the Equifax breach, but there have been some small hints that it could be a possibility. During Tuesday's hearing, Representative Walden mentioned in his opening statement that the breach has \"markers of nation-state activity.\" But when pressed on the topic by representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey, former CEO Smith wouldn't answer. \u201cI have no opinion,\u201d he said, eventually conceding that it's \"possible.\" Smith noted that the FBI is investigating the breach. 6. Equifax made its breach notification site a separate domain because its main site wasn't up to the task. One of the major blunders of Equifax's breach response was its decision to host an Equifaxsecurity2017.com notification site as a separate domain rather than on its established and trusted Equifax.com main site. Designing a totally distinct domain opened the Equifax breach response to a number of threats and vulnerabilities, including phishing sites masquerading as the satellite breach-response page. (In a moment of true dystopian chaos, the official Equifax Twitter account repeatedly tweeted a phishing link, mistaking it for the breach-response page.)

Now, 10 months later, the company would like to make a correction: That incident actually exposed three billion accounts\u2014every Yahoo account that existed at the time. On the one hand, this new information doesn't really change things in a practical sense, because the initial billion account estimate was already enormous\u2014you could safely assume you were impacted\u2014and Yahoo took protective steps for all users in December, like resetting passwords and unencrypted security questions. On the other hand, three billion accounts . \"They are as big as it gets,\" says Jeremiah Grossman, who worked as an information security officer at Yahoo for two years in the early 2000s and is now the chief of security strategy at SentinelOne. \"Maybe Google or maybe Facebook, but the next mega-breach is not going to be orders of magnitude bigger.\"\" In this case, it took Yahoo three years to discover and disclose the breach, and almost four years to complete the investigation. And let's not confuse all of that with a separate Yahoo breach perpetrated in late 2014, and not disclosed until September 2016, that impacted 500 million accounts. That alone still holds as the second-biggest known breach of all time, in terms of impacted users. (One could argue that the recent Equifax breach , which impacted 145.5 million people, will ultimately have greater negative overall impact because of the particular sensitivity of the data involved.) The most recent disclosure also comes after Yahoo's recent acquisition by Verizon and subsequent merger with AOL. Disclosing two enormous breaches back to back at the end of 2016 put a strain on the acquisition process, and even reportedly led Verizon to demand a price reduction. Even though three billion sounds like a dramatic number, Grossman argues that it shouldn't come as a surprise. \"To everybody on the outside, it looked to us when we originally read all the information that [the breach] must have impacted all the accounts,\" he says. The attackers \"got so deep in the system, I couldn\u2019t imagine why certain accounts would have been affected and not others.\" Yahoo published information about the revision on its Account Security Update page , attempting to clarify the timeline of events. \"Subsequent to Yahoo's acquisition by Verizon, and during integration, the company recently obtained new intelligence and now believes, following an investigation with the assistance of outside forensic experts, that all Yahoo user accounts were affected by the August 2013 theft,\" the company wrote. The update from Yahoo is a new high\u2014that is to say, a new low\u2014in terms of mega-breach scale. Think of it this way: On Monday, Equifax faced warranted criticism when it revised the number of people affected by its massive data breach from 143 million to 145.5 million. Yahoo's adjustment weighs in at 800 times that. The silver lining, one imagines, is that it quite literally can't get any worse.

That\u2019s their problem. It\u2019s no deterrent to Dyson\u2019s ambitious plan to leap from vacuums to its own electric vehicle by 2020. Dyson, which has built millions of electric batteries for its home appliances, could go the easy route, and make an electric car battery to sell to automakers. But that\u2019s too small potatoes for the \u00a32.5 billion-revenue company. \u201cWe like solving problems with products,\u201d Conze says. \u201cYes, we could be the developer of the most efficient battery, but that\u2019s not what excites us as much as using technology to come up with a product that can really make a difference.\u201d Building a vehicle won\u2019t be easy. In 2016, after seven years of developing self-driving technology, Google abandoned plans to build its own jelly-bean pod cars, and partnered with Chrysler for the metal-bending part of the equation. Over the summer, Apple scaled back its self-driving operations, reportedly because the project proved too difficult . Software-focused startups ranging from Uber and Lyft to Cruise Automation and Argo AI have partnered with Big Auto for similar reasons. The only Silicon Valley company to actually make a car, Tesla, has been late to deliver every new model it has launched. But Dyson isn\u2019t interested in partnering. \u201cWe want to do our own thing; we want to do it our own way,\u201d Conze says. Naturally, the Malmesbury, UK, company will work with suppliers, he says, \u201cbut we want to do a Dyson car the way that we think it needs to be done, and that requires us to have the engineering that can do the car end-to-end and also to own the manufacturing.\u201d Recommended Review: Dyson V7 Motorhead Cord-Free Vacuum Unlike other auto newcomers, however, Dyson does not feel compelled to develop its own self- driving technology. Dyson historically has not focused on software, though in recent years it has hired 600 software engineers to work on things like artificial intelligence and applications for its robot vacuum. Conze says he believes Dyson will be able to buy \u201coff the shelf\u201d software in coming years to give its vehicles basic autonomous features like lane-keeping technology. The company has hired 400 engineers and committed \u00a32 billion to its car project. That\u2019s a small fraction of the $10 billion or more that companies such as Daimler and Tesla are spending on electric and autonomous vehicles . Still, Conze believes Dyson can apply its expertise in batteries, energy-efficient motors, and air flow to vehicles. There are plenty of other areas in which Dyson will need to gain expertise, Conze notes, but \u201cthat\u2019s kind of the joy in doing this to some extent.\u201d He says the company had no expertise in motors a decade ago, and now makes 10 million of what it calls \u201cdigital\u201d motors, which spin at high speeds, per year in its factories. The company had no expertise in hair dryers before building its Supersonic hair dryer, which launched last year and has sold more than 1 million units. As with many bold, possibly na\u00efve innovators, Dyson believes its outsider status gives it a leg up. \u201cMost of the incumbent advantages in the car industry today become a disadvantage very quickly because you\u2019re sitting on infrastructure and know-how for the cars of yesterday, not the cars of tomorrow,\u201d Conze says. \u201cIf you know a lot about combustion engines, there is very, very little transferable knowledge from building combustion engines to building electric engines.\u201d Increasing the distance electric vehicles can drive between charges is a top priority for Dyson. Conze expects Dyson\u2019s vehicles to have 50 percent to 100 percent greater range than existing offerings, though he declines to specify what that means. (Many models top out around 100 miles of battery-only driving; Tesla\u2019s Model S goes up to 315 miles.)

The Pixel 2 is sure to be the biggest news, but we also expect Google to show off a new gadget or two for the smart home, some VR stuff, and probably something wacky that nobody's anticipating. The company has been diving hard into consumer electronics this past year in an effort to reposition itself as a gadget company. Even as Google works with top-name manufacturers like Samsung and Motorola to put its Android operating system on high-end handsets, and as the company pushes its Chrome OS laptop software onto notebooks from Acer and Lenovo that make their way into classrooms and offices, the tech giant is still intent on building its own hardware. So far, it's been successful in making products people like\u2014the Pixel phone, the Google Home smart speaker\u2014but what remains to be seen is if Google can out-innovate its partners in these highly competitive, highly commoditized product categories. To help it make better phones, Google acquired a division of smartphone-maker HTC. We likely won't see any of the fruits of the that deal, which happened just last month, in today's Pixel phone.

The human brain\u2019s power consumption resembles that of a 20-watt incandescent lightbulb. In contrast, one of the world\u2019s largest and fastest supercomputers, the K computer in Kobe, Japan, consumes as much as 9.89 megawatts of energy\u2014an amount roughly equivalent to the power usage of 10,000 households. Yet in 2013, even with that much power, it took the machine 40 minutes to simulate just a single second\u2019s worth of 1 percent of human brain activity. Quanta Magazine About \nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine , an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences. Now engineering researchers at the California NanoSystems Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, are hoping to match some of the brain\u2019s computational and energy efficiency with systems that mirror the brain\u2019s structure. They are building a device , perhaps the first one, that is \u201c inspired by the brain to generate the properties that enable the brain to do what it does,\u201d according to Adam Stieg , a research scientist and associate director of the institute, who leads the project with Jim Gimzewski , a professor of chemistry at UCLA. The device is a far cry from conventional computers, which are based on minute wires imprinted on silicon chips in highly ordered patterns. The current pilot version is a 2-millimeter-by-2-millimeter mesh of silver nanowires connected by artificial synapses. Unlike silicon circuitry, with its geometric precision, this device is messy, like \u201ca highly interconnected plate of noodles,\u201d Stieg said. And instead of being designed, the fine structure of the UCLA device essentially organized itself out of random chemical and electrical processes. Yet in its complexity, this silver mesh network resembles the brain. The mesh boasts 1 billion artificial synapses per square centimeter, which is within a couple of orders of magnitude of the real thing. The network\u2019s electrical activity also displays a property unique to complex systems like the brain: \u201ccriticality,\u201d a state between order and chaos indicative of maximum efficiency. This network of highly interconnected nanowires may look chaotic and random, but its structure and behavior resemble those of neurons in the brain. Researchers at the California NanoSystems Institute are developing it as a brainlike device for learning and computation. Eleanor Demis Moreover, preliminary experiments suggest that this neuromorphic (brainlike) silver wire mesh has great functional potential. It can already perform simple learning and logic operations. It can clean the unwanted noise from received signals, a capability that\u2019s important for voice recognition and similar tasks that challenge conventional computers. And its existence proves the principle that it might be possible one day to build devices that can compute with an energy efficiency close to that of the brain. These advantages look especially appealing as the limits of miniaturization and efficiency for silicon microprocessors now loom. \u201cMoore\u2019s law is dead, transistors are no longer getting smaller, and [people] are going, \u2018Oh, my God, what do we do now?\u2019\u201d said Alex Nugent , CEO of the Santa Fe-based neuromorphic computing company Knowm , who was not involved in the UCLA project. \u201cI\u2019m very excited about the idea, the direction of their work,\u201d Nugent said. \u201cTraditional computing platforms are a billion times less efficient.\u201d Switches That Act Like Synapses Energy efficiency wasn\u2019t Gimzewski\u2019s motivation when he started the silver wire project 10 years ago. Rather, it was boredom. After using scanning tunneling microscopes to look at electronics at the atomic scale for 20 years, he said, \u201cI was tired of perfection and precise control [and] got a little bored with reductionism.\u201d In 2007, he accepted an invitation to study single atomic switches developed by a group that Masakazu Aono led at the International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics in Tsukuba, Japan. The switches contain the same ingredient that turns a silver spoon black when it touches an egg: silver sulfide, sandwiched between solid metallic silver. Masakazu Aono, director general of the International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics in Japan\u2019s National Institute for Materials Science, is the leader of the group that developed the atomic switches that function like artificial synapses in the network. National Institute for Materials Science Applying voltage to the devices pushes positively charged silver ions out of the silver sulfide and toward the silver cathode layer, where they are reduced to metallic silver. Atom-wide filaments of silver grow, eventually closing the gap between the metallic silver sides. As a result, the switch is on and current can flow. Reversing the current flow has the opposite effect: The silver bridges shrink, and the switch turns off. Soon after developing the switch, however, Aono\u2019s group started to see irregular behavior. The more often the switch was used, the more easily it would turn on. If it went unused for a while, it would slowly turn off by itself. In effect, the switch remembered its history. Aono and his colleagues also found that the switches seemed to interact with each other, such that turning on one switch would sometimes inhibit or turn off others nearby. Most of Aono\u2019s group wanted to engineer these odd properties out of the switches. But Gimzewski and Stieg (who had just finished his doctorate in Gimzewski\u2019s group) were reminded of synapses, the switches between nerve cells in the human brain, which also change their responses with experience and interact with each other. During one of their many visits to Japan, they had an idea. \u201cWe thought: Why don\u2019t we try to embed them in a structure reminiscent of the cortex in a mammalian brain [and study that]?\u201d Stieg said. Building such an intricate structure was a challenge, but Stieg and Audrius Avizienis, who had just joined the group as a graduate student, developed a protocol to do it. By pouring silver nitrate onto tiny copper spheres, they could induce a network of microscopically thin intersecting silver wires to grow. They could then expose the mesh to sulfur gas to create a silver sulfide layer between the silver wires, as in the Aono team\u2019s original atomic switch. Self-Organized Criticality When Gimzewski and Stieg told others about their project, almost nobody thought it would work. Some said the device would show one type of static activity and then sit there, Stieg recalled. Others guessed the opposite: \u201cThey said the switching would cascade and the whole thing would just burn out,\u201d Gimzewski said. But the device did not melt. Rather, as Gimzewski and Stieg observed through an infrared camera, the input current kept changing the paths it followed through the device\u2014proof that activity in the network was not localized but rather distributed, as it is in the brain. Then, one fall day in 2010, while Avizienis and his fellow graduate student Henry Sillin were increasing the input voltage to the device, they suddenly saw the output voltage start to fluctuate, seemingly at random, as if the mesh of wires had come alive. \u201cWe just sat and watched it, fascinated,\u201d Sillin said. The silver nanowire network (left) takes the form of a tiny square of mesh at the center of the device (right). The housing that holds the square mesh allows users to introduce signals as inputs and to measure the output results. Eleanor Demis (SEM image)/Henry Sillin (hand with device) They knew they were on to something. When Avizienis analyzed several days\u2019 worth of monitoring data, he found that the network stayed at the same activity level for short periods more often than for long periods. They later found that smaller areas of activity were more common than larger ones. \u201cThat was really jaw-dropping,\u201d Avizienis said, describing it as \u201cthe first [time] we pulled a power law out of this.\u201d Power laws describe mathematical relationships in which one variable changes as a power of the other. They apply to systems in which larger scale, longer events are much less common than smaller scale, shorter ones\u2014but are also still far more common than one would expect from a chance distribution. Per Bak , the Danish physicist who died in 2002, first proposed power laws as hallmarks of all kinds of complex dynamical systems that can organize over large timescales and long distances. Power-law behavior, he said, indicates that a complex system operates at a dynamical sweet spot between order and chaos, a state of \u201ccriticality\u201d in which all parts are interacting and connected for maximum efficiency. As Bak predicted, power-law behavior has been observed in the human brain : In 2003, Dietmar Plenz , a neuroscientist with the National Institutes of Health, observed that groups of nerve cells activated others, which in turn activated others, often forming systemwide activation cascades. Plenz found that the sizes of these cascades fell along a power-law distribution, and that the brain was indeed operating in a way that maximized activity propagation without risking runaway activity. The fact that the UCLA device also shows power-law behavior is a big deal, Plenz said, because it suggests that, as in the brain, a delicate balance between activation and inhibition keeps all of its parts interacting with one another. The activity doesn\u2019t overwhelm the network, but it also doesn\u2019t die out. Gimzewski and Stieg later found an additional similarity between the silver network and the brain: Just as a sleeping human brain shows fewer short activation cascades than a brain that\u2019s awake, brief activation states in the silver network become less common at lower energy inputs. In a way, then, reducing the energy input into the device can generate a state that resembles the sleeping state of the human brain. Training and Reservoir Computing But even if the silver wire network has brainlike properties, can it solve computing tasks? Preliminary experiments suggest the answer is yes, although the device is far from resembling a traditional computer. For one thing, there is no software. Instead, the researchers exploit the fact that the network can distort an input signal in many different ways, depending on where the output is measured. This suggests possible uses for voice or image recognition, because the device should be able to clean a noisy input signal. But it also suggests that the device could be used for a process called reservoir computing. Because one input could in principle generate many, perhaps millions, of different outputs (the \u201creservoir\u201d), users can choose or combine outputs in such a way that the result is a desired computation of the inputs. For example, if you stimulate the device at two different places at the same time, chances are that one of the millions of different outputs will represent the sum of the two inputs. The challenge is to find the right outputs and decode them and to find out how best to encode information so that the network can understand it. The way to do this is by training the device: by running a task hundreds or perhaps thousands of times, first with one type of input and then with another, and comparing which output best solves a task. \u201cWe don\u2019t program the device but we select the best way to encode the information such that the [network behaves] in an interesting and useful manner,\u201d Gimzewski said. In work that\u2019s soon to be published, the researchers trained the wire network to execute simple logic operations. And in unpublished experiments, they trained the network to solve the equivalent of a simple memory task taught to lab rats called a T-maze test. In the test, a rat in a T-shaped maze is rewarded when it learns to make the correct turn in response to a light. With its own version of training, the network could make the correct response 94 percent of the time. The silver nanowire network takes the form of a tiny square of mesh at the center of the device. Eleanor Demis So far, these results aren\u2019t much more than a proof of principle, Nugent said. \u201cA little rat making a decision in a T-maze is nowhere close to what somebody in machine learning does to evaluate their systems\u201d on a traditional computer, he said. He doubts the device will lead to a chip that does much that\u2019s useful in the next few years. But the potential, he emphasized, is huge. That\u2019s because the network, like the brain, doesn\u2019t separate processing and memory. Traditional computers need to shuttle information between different areas that handle the two functions. \u201cAll that extra communication adds up because it takes energy to charge wires,\u201d Nugent said. With traditional machines, he said, \u201cliterally, you could run France on the electricity that it would take to simulate a full human brain at moderate resolution.\u201d If devices like the silver wire network can eventually solve tasks as effectively as machine-learning algorithms running on traditional computers, they could do so using only one-billionth as much power. \u201cAs soon as they do that, they\u2019re going to win in power efficiency, hands down,\u201d Nugent said. The UCLA findings also lend support to the view that under the right circumstances, intelligent systems can form by self-organization, without the need for any template or process to design them. The silver network \u201cemerged spontaneously,\u201d said Todd Hylton , the former manager of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency program that supported early stages of the project. \u201cAs energy flows through [it], it\u2019s this big dance because every time one new structure forms, the energy doesn\u2019t go somewhere else. People have built computer models of networks that achieve some critical state. But this one just sort of did it all by itself.\u201d Gimzewski believes that the silver wire network or devices like it might be better than traditional computers at making predictions about complex processes. Traditional computers model the world with equations that often only approximate complex phenomena. Neuromorphic atomic switch networks align their own innate structural complexity with that of the phenomenon they are modeling. They are also inherently fast\u2014the state of the network can fluctuate at upward of tens of thousands of changes per second. \u201cWe are using a complex system to understand complex phenomena,\u201d Gimzewski said.

Andrew McMillen is a freelance writer and the author of Talking Smack: Honest Conversations About Drugs . Sign up to get Backchannel's weekly newsletter, and follow us on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram . Steemit , a nascent social media platform, is trying to change all that by rewarding its users with cold, hard cash in the form of a cryptocurrency. Everything that you do on Steemit\u2014every post, every comment, and every like\u2014translates to a fraction of a digital currency called Steem. Over time, as Steem accumulates, it can be cashed out for normal currency. (Or held, if you think Steem is headed for a bright future.) The idea for Steemit began with a white paper, which quietly spread among a small community of techies when it was released in March 2016. The exhaustive 44-page overview wasn\u2019t intended for a general audience, but the document contained a powerful message. User-generated content, the authors argued, had created billions of dollars of value for the shareholders of social media companies. Yet while moguls like Mark Zuckerberg got rich, the content creators who fueled networks like Facebook got nothing. Steemit\u2019s creators outlined their intention to challenge that power imbalance by putting a value on contributions: \u201cSteem is the first cryptocurrency that attempts to accurately and transparently reward\u2026[the] individuals who make subjective contributions to its community.\u201d A minuscule but dedicated audience rallied around Steemit, posting stories and experimenting with the form to discover what posts attracted the most votes and comments. When Steemit released its first payouts that July, three months after launch, things got serious. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are only worth whatever value people ascribe to them, so there was no guarantee that the tokens dropping into Steemit accounts would ever be worth anything. Yet the Steem that rolled out to users translated to more than $1.2 million in American dollars. Overnight, the little-known currency spiked to a $350 million market capitalization\u2014momentarily rocketing it into the rare company of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the world\u2019s highest-valued cryptocurrencies. Today, Steem\u2019s market capitalization has settled in the vicinity of $294 million. One Steem is worth slightly more than one United States Dollar, and the currency remains a regular presence at the edge of the top 20 most traded digital currencies . It\u2019s a precipitous rise for a company that just 18 months ago existed only as an idea in the minds of its founders. More than $30 million worth of Steem has been distributed to over 50,000 users since its launch, according to company reports. It\u2019s too early to know whether Steemit can hold onto its users\u2019 interest and its market value. But its goal\u2014upending a model built by social media giants over decades of use in favor of a more populist system\u2014is significant in itself. By removing the middlemen and allowing users to profit directly from the networks they participate in, Steemit could provide a roadmap to a more equitable social network. Or users could get bored or distracted by something newer and shinier and abandon it. The possibility of a popped bubble looms over every cryptocurrency, and the bubbles are filled with both attention and speculative investment. Steemit\u2019s value is based on money that its founders have virtually willed into existence. Fortunes could vanish at any moment, but someone stands to get rich in the process. The creators of Steemit didn\u2019t set out to build a social network. When Ned Scott and Dan Larimer first spoke on the phone in mid-2015, having previously chatted online, they began dreaming up new applications for blockchains\u2014the distributed, verified databases that back today\u2019s wave of digital currencies. Scott, a former financial analyst, was fascinated by the economics that drive cryptocurrencies. Larimer, a computer scientist, already had cryptocurrency bona fides, having developed an ambitious exchange called BitShares . At first, they were intrigued by the idea of using the hivemind trust of blockchain to create an insurance network. They wondered if they could incentivize a group of people to pool money, which could then be drawn upon by an individual in the event of an accident or emergency\u2014a kind of libertarian backup plan. More From This Edition Startups\u2019 Trillion-Dollar Numbers Game But in order to make it work, they needed a way to hold people accountable. Their plan hinged on building a robust communications forum. By linking people\u2019s accounts to their discussions, each individual\u2019s claims and communications would be both able to be audited and unable to be censored. The community would have to evaluate each claim, voting the best posts towards the top. That\u2019s when the wider scope of their project took shape. \u201cWe realized that this is going to look a lot like Reddit,\u201d says Scott, \u201cbut people are going to get paid for participating.\u201d Today, Scott supports the software development of the platform and currency from the company headquarters in Austin, Texas, alongside a distributed team of 30 staff worldwide. Larimer resigned from his role as chief technology officer in March, but continues to post on Steemit; the pair published a joint statement announcing the separation, emphasizing that they \u201cparted on amicable terms without dispute.\u201d At its core, Steemit looks a lot like any other social network. The most popular tags include things like photography, life, travel, art, and, perhaps unsurprisingly, Steemit itself. Scott\u2019s favorite success stories involve people who use the site to both document and fund their explorations\u2014like a travel blogger and photographer (username: @heiditravels ; 5,904 followers) who has funded her trips around the world with Steem, and a young man in West Africa ( @infovore ; 3,479 followers) who started a popular \u201cSteem magazine\u201d about the currency and its pop-up community. @infovore\u2019s regular posts earned him a global audience, as well as the equivalent of $41,000 in virtual currency during his first few months on the site. According to Scott, Steemit boasts an \u201cincredibly small\u201d number of trolls, which he argues is because of the cash incentive. (It could also be due to the relatively small community, which includes around 350,000 registered accounts as of September.) \u201cFor the first time, there\u2019s an opportunity cost to trolling,\u201d says the cofounder. \u201cEvery second that someone spends trolling, they\u2019re potentially damaging their reputation and preventing themselves from earning any Steem.\u201d New users are also encouraged to introduce themselves to the community, and take a photo of their smiling face in order to verify their account, which may be a contributing factor: So far, it seems that anonymity is less prized on Steemit than on Reddit, where \u201cthrowaway\u201d accounts are commonplace. You might have heard of Bitcoin mining operations where racks of powerful PC processors are dedicated to solving complex mathematical problems. Their electricity bills are enormous, but so are the potential rewards for mining Bitcoin, which is likely to become more valuable\u2014and more difficult to mine\u2014as the currency approaches its maximum circulation of 21 million coins. In these more traditional \u201cproof-of-work\u201d blockchains, tokens are distributed to the people whose computers are performing work, known as \u201cminers.\u201d Steem is designed differently. Its tokens are generated at a fixed rate of one block every three seconds, which are then distributed to various parties in the system based on the blockchain\u2019s rules. These parties are incentivized to compete in ways that add value to the network: 75 percent of new tokens are distributed to the \u201crewards pool\u201d for content creators and curators, while smaller fractions are awarded to vested token holders. Steemit\u2019s function is rooted in transparency. Every action a user makes on the site is logged on the blockchain\u2014meaning every vote, currency transfer, and even the amount of Steem sitting in someone\u2019s digital wallet, is public and viewable . There are two ways of earning Steem. The first is the \u201crewards pool\u201d of digital tokens, which incentivize content creation and curation\u2014in other words, quality posts that are upvoted by other users. The second is a voting system which assigns a value to each post and comment on the platform, and then distributes Steem tokens to the creators based on the wisdom of the crowd. The more users that upvote your posts on Steemit, the more Steem you\u2019ll earn, which can then be cashed out of your wallet using an online currency exchange. Much like Reddit, Steemit is an experiment in group psychology, where the human hivemind (as tallied by individual votes) determines the most popular\u2014and lucrative\u2014content. In contrast, invisible but immensely powerful algorithms control what each Facebook and Instagram user sees in their feeds. \u201cOn Reddit, there are people who put up links and posts, and are then accused of \u2018karma whoring\u2019\u2014or basically, selling out to get these worthless internet points,\u201d says Scott. \u201cOn Steemit, people show up to earn Steem. They\u2019re posting and linking stuff, and they\u2019re earning something that\u2019s worth real money.\u201d A weighted voting system places greater value on votes placed by the older accounts of early Steemit adopters, who appear to be in it for the long haul. While a vote from a brand-new user may be worth a fraction of a cent, a vote from someone who has gained a reputation for posting quality content each day might be worth several dollars. In turn, the valuable votes of these \u201cpower users\u201d attract votes from a crowd of less powerful users seeking to cash in on the action, like ants jostling for crumbs. Under this weighted model, individuals who have contributed the most to the platform have greater influence over how other contributions are scored\u2014which creates a snowballing effect. Some have argued that this system unfairly benefits the founders and those in their network who were attracted early to Steemit. Case in point: My own year-old Steemit account ( @andrewmcmillen ) is worth approximately USD $1,300. As of early October Ned Scott\u2019s account, @ned , has an estimated account value of USD $5.08 million. Cryptocurrency has been all but impenetrable for the average person, who might struggle to recall a handful of computer passwords, let alone safely store the proverbial keys to a virtual bank account. It exists as an esoteric part of modern life. Only the most motivated users have educated themselves about how to trade real dollars for currency, and then use said currency to their advantage. The rise of Bitcoin, for instance, is linked to black markets; once someone figured out it could facilitate the distribution of drugs through sites on the dark web, like Silk Road, the currency\u2019s value took off. Today, Bitcoin accounts for a little less than half of the entire cryptocurrency trading market; its nearest competitor is Ethereum, which occupies about 20 percent. But the most innovative aspect of Steem is its lack of friction: New users can join Steemit and begin earning tiny fractions of the currency immediately, without even understanding how it works. It is designed as cryptocurrency for the masses, as the barriers to entry are almost nonexistent. Unlike Bitcoin, there\u2019s no messing around with coin traders or triple-checking long, fiddly strings of letters and numbers to make sure you\u2019re not accidentally sending your money to a Nigerian prince. On Steemit, you simply create an account, start browsing the site, upvote posts you like, and search for the gaps you might fill by posting something of your own. If you\u2019re not creative, no problem: You can curate by spotting high-quality posts soon after they\u2019re published and voting for them as a kind of early investor, before the rest of the crowd arrives.

Some of these modules don\u2019t even talk to other modules, and for good measure. The blood-pumping and breath-reflex buildings should be left to their own devices. The other modules are prone to arguing, bickering, disagreeing, subverting one another, spasming uncontrollably, staging coups, freaking the fuck out, and all sorts of other hysterics. Here are a couple of examples. A few months ago, my girlfriend and I set out from the Galapagos for the French Polynesians. The 3,000 miles of open sea can take anywhere from two weeks to a month to cross. My girlfriend does not often succumb to seasickness, but in an area of the South Pacific known as the Convergence Zone, a confused sea set our sailboat into a strange and jerky rhythm. She fell prey to a terrible sensation that lasted for a few days. Seasickness is a case of our brain modules not communicating with one another (or doing their own thing). When the visual cues of motion from our environment do not match the signals from our inner ears (where we sense balance), our brains assume that we\u2019ve been poisoned. It\u2019s a reasonable assumption for creatures that climb through trees eating all the brightly-colored things. Toxins disrupt our brains\u2019 processing, leading to misfires and bad data. We did not evolve to go to sea, so when motion does not match what we are seeing, our bodies think we\u2019ve lost our ability to balance on two legs. The result is that we empty our stomachs (getting rid of the poison) and we lie down and feel zero desire to move about (preventing us from plummeting to our deaths from whatever high limb we might be swinging from). It doesn\u2019t matter that we know this is happening in a different module of our brains, a higher-level processing module. We can know without a doubt that we haven\u2019t been poisoned, but this module is not going to easily win out over the seasickness module. Having been seasick myself, and being very curious about such things, I\u2019ve felt the various modules wrestle with one another. Lying still and sleeping a lot while seasick, I will then jump up and perform various tasks needed of me around the boat\u2014the seasickness practically gone for the moment\u2014only to lie back down once the chore is done. Modules get different priorities based on our environmental stimuli. Our brains are not a holistic desktop PC. To truly watch their analogue in action, turn on C-SPAN or sit in on a contentious corporate board meeting. Another example of our modules in battle with one another: There are some very strong modules inside of us that are programmed to make copies of themselves (and to do that, they need to make copies of us). These are the sex modules, and they have some of the largest and nicest buildings in our internal Washington D.C.s. These modules direct many of our waking hours as we navigate dating scenes, tend to our current relationships, determine what to wear and how to maintain our bodies, and so much more. These reproductive modules might fill a woman with the urge to dress up and go dancing. And men with the urge to go to places where women dress up and dance while the men stand at bars drinking. Those modules might even lead some of these people to pair up and go home with one another. And this is where various other modules will intervene with pills, condoms, and other tools designed to subvert the original urges that got the couples together in the first place. However, if those devices are not employed, even though higher-level modules most definitely did not want anyone getting pregnant that night, a lovechild might be born, and other modules will then kick in and flood brains with love and deep connections to assist in the rearing of that child. Some of our modules want us to get pregnant. Often, stronger modules very much wish to delay this or make sure it\u2019s with the right person. Dormant modules lie in wait to make sure we\u2019re connected with our children no matter what those other hedonistic and unfeeling pricks in those other buildings down the block think. Critical to keep in mind here is that these modules are highly variable across the population, and our unique mix of modules create the personalities that we associate with our singular selves. It means we aren\u2019t all alike. We might have modules that crave reproduction, even though some of our bodies do not create sperm, or our eggs cannot be fertilized. We might carry the reproduction module, even though the sexual-attraction module is for the same sex as our own. The perfectly engineered desktop computer analogy fails spectacularly, and the failure of this analogy leads to some terrible legislation and social mores, as we can\u2019t seem to tolerate designs different from our own (or the average). It also leads AI researchers down erroneous paths if they want to mimic human behavior. Fallibility and the disjointed nature of processing systems will have to be built in by design. We will have to purposefully break systems similar to how nature haphazardly cobbled them together. We will especially have to simulate a most peculiar feature of this modularity, one that combines with Theory of Mind in a very special way. It is this combination that leads to human consciousness. It is the most important feature in our blueprint for a self-conscious machine. The Most Important Mistake With the concept of Theory of Mind firmly in our thoughts, and the knowledge that brain modules are both fallible and disconnected, we are primed to understand human consciousness, how it arose, and what it\u2019s (not) for. This may surprise those who are used to hearing that we don\u2019t understand human consciousness and have made no progress in that arena. This isn\u2019t true at all. What we have made no progress in doing is understanding what human consciousness is for. Thousands of years of failure in this regard points to the simple truth: Human consciousness is not for anything at all. It serves no purpose. It has no evolutionary benefit. It arises at the union of two modules that are both so supremely useful that we can\u2019t survive without either, and so we tolerate the annoying and detrimental consciousness that arises as a result. One of those modules is Theory of Mind. It has already been mentioned that Theory of Mind consumes more brain processing power than any other higher-level neurological activity. It\u2019s that damn important. The problem with this module is that it isn\u2019t selective with its powers; it\u2019s not even clear that such selectivity would be possible. That means our Theory of Mind abilities get turned onto ourselves just as often (or far more often) than it is wielded on others. Imagine an alien ray gun that shoots with such a wide spread that anywhere you aim it, you hit yourself. That should give you a fair picture of how we employ Theory of Mind. Our brains are primed to watch humans to determine what they are thinking, why they are behaving the way they are behaving, and what they might do next. Looking down, these brains (and their mindless modules) see a body attached to them. These modules watch hands perform tasks, feet take them places, words pop out in streams of thought. It is not possible to turn off our Theory of Mind modules (and it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea anyway; we would be blind in a world of hurtling rocks). And so this Theory of Mind module concocts stories about our own behaviors. Why do we want to get dressed up and go dancing? Because it\u2019s fun! And our friends will be there! Why do we want to keep eating when we are already full? Because it\u2019s delicious! And we walked an extra thousand steps today! These questions about our own behaviors are never ending. And the answers are almost always wrong. Allow that to sink in for a moment. The explanations we tell ourselves about our own behaviors are almost always wrong. This is the weird thing about our Theory of Mind superpowers. They\u2019re pretty good when we employ them on others. They fail spectacularly when we turn them on ourselves. Our guesses about others\u2019 motivations are far more accurate than the guesses we make about our own. In a sense, we have developed a magic force-field to protect us from the alien mind-reading ray gun that we shoot others (and ourselves) with. This forcefield is our egos, and it gives us an inflated opinion of ourselves, a higher-minded rationale for our actions, and an illusion of sanity that we rarely extend to our peers. The incorrect explanations we come up with about our own behaviors are meant to protect ourselves. They are often wildly creative, or they are absurdly simplistic. Answers like \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cdelicious\u201d are circular answers pointing back to a happiness module, with no curiosity about the underlying benefit of this reward mechanism. The truth is that we keep eating when we\u2019re full because we evolved in a world of caloric scarcity. We dance to attract mates to make copies of ourselves, because the modules that guided this behavior made lots of copies, which crowded out other designs. Researchers have long studied this mismatch of behaviors and the lies we tell ourselves about our behaviors. One study primed test subjects to think they were feeling warm (easily done by dropping in certain words in a fake test given to those subjects). When these people got up to adjust the thermostat, the researchers paused them to ask why they were adjusting the temperature. Convincing stories were told, and when the primed words were pointed out, incredulity reigned. Even when we are shown where our actions come from, we choose to believe our internal Theory of Mind module, which has already reached its own conclusion. Subjects in fMRI machines have revealed another peculiarity. Watching their brains in real time, we can see that decisions are made before higher level parts of the brain are aware of the decisions. That is, researchers can tell which button a test subject will press before those subjects claim to have made the choice. The action comes before the narrative. We move; we observe our actions; we tell ourselves stories about why we do things. The very useful Theory of Mind tool\u2014which we can\u2019t shut off\u2014continues to run and make up things about our own actions. More pronounced examples of this come from people with various neurological impairments. Test subjects with vision processing problems, or with hemispheres of their brains severed from one another, can be shown different images in each eye. Disconnected modules take in these conflicting inputs and create fascinating stories. One eye might see a rake and the other will see a pile of snow. The rake eye is effectively blind, with the test subject unable to tell what it is seeing if asked. But the module for processing the image is still active, so when asked what tool is needed to handle the image that is seen (the snow), the person will answer \u201ca rake.\u201d That\u2019s not the interesting bit. What\u2019s interesting is that the person will go through amazing contortions to justify this answer, even after the entire process is explained to them. You can tell your internal Washington DC how its wires are crossed, and it will continue to persist in its lunacy. This is how we would have to build a self-conscious machine. And you\u2019re hopefully beginning to see why no one should waste their time. These machines (probably) wouldn\u2019t end the world, but they would be just as goofy and nonsensical as nature has made us. The only reason I can think of to build such machines is to employ more shrinks. The Blueprint Revisited An eccentric fan of Alan Turing\u2019s Turing Test with too much time on her hands has heard about this blueprint for building a self-conscious machine. Thinking that this will lead to a kind of super-intelligent mind that will spit out the cure to cancer and the path to cold fusion, she hires me and gives me a large budget and a team of electrical and mechanical engineers. How would we go about actually assembling our self-conscious machine? Applying what we know about Theory of Mind and disconnected modules, the first thing we would build is an awareness program. These are quite simple and already exist in spades. Using off-the-shelf technology, we decide that our first machine will look and act very much like a self-driving car. For many years, the biggest limitation to achieving truly autonomous vehicles has been the awareness apparatus: the sensors that let the vehicle know what\u2019s going on around it. Enormous progress here has provided the sight and hearing that our machine will employ. With these basic senses, we then use machine learning algorithms to build a repertoire of behaviors for our AI car to learn. Unlike the direction most autonomous vehicle research is going\u2014where engineers want to teach their car how to do certain things safely\u2014our team will instead be teaching an array of sensors all over a city grid to watch other cars and guess what they\u2019re doing. That blue Nissan is going to the grocery store because \u201cit is hungry.\u201d That red van is pulling into a gas station because \u201cit needs power.\u201d That car is inebriated. That one can\u2019t see very well. That other one has slow reaction speeds. That one is full of adrenaline. Thousands and thousands of these needs and anthropomorphic descriptors are built up in a vast library of phrases or indicator lights. If we were building a person-shaped robot, we would do the same by observing people and building a vocabulary for the various actions that humans seem to perform. Sensors would note objects of awareness by scanning eyes (which is what humans and dogs do). They would learn our moods by our facial expressions and body posture (which current systems are already able to do). This library and array of sensors would form our Theory of Mind module. Its purpose is simply to tell stories about the actions of others. The magic would happen when we turn it on itself. Our library starts simply with First Order concepts, but then builds up to Second and Third Order ideas. Does that yellow Ford see the gray Chevy coming toward it? It swerved slightly, so yes, it did. Does that van think the hot rod drives too aggressively? It is giving it more room than the average room given to other cars on the road, so yes it does. Does the van think all hot rods drive too aggressively? It is giving the same amount of room to the Corvette that just left the dealership with only two miles on the odometer, so yes it does. Does this make the van prejudiced? When we turn our own car loose and make the module self-referential, it\u2019ll have to determine if it is prejudiced as well. Perhaps it would rely on other data and consider itself prudent rather than prejudiced (ego protecting it from wielding Theory of Mind accurately). Before we get that far, we need to make our machine self-aware. And so we teach it to drive itself around town for its owner. We then ask the AI car to observe its own behaviors and come up with guesses as to what it\u2019s doing. The key here is to not give it perfect awareness. Don\u2019t let it have access to the GPS unit, which has been set for the grocery store. Don\u2019t let it know what the owner\u2019s cell phone knows, which is that the husband has texted the wife to pick up the kids on the way home for work. To mimic human behavior, ignorance is key. As is the surety of initial guesses, or what we might call biases. Early assumptions are given a higher weight in our algorithms than theories which come later and have more data (overcoming initial biases requires a preponderance of evidence. A likelihood of 50 percent might be enough to set the mind initially, but to overcome that first guess will require a likelihood of 75 percent, for instance). Stories are concocted which are wrong and build up cloudy pictures for future wrongness. So when the car stops at the gas station every day and gets plugged into the electrical outlet, even though the car is always at 85 percent charge, the Theory of Mind algorithm assumes it is being safe rather than sorry, or preparing for a possible hurricane evacuation like that crazy escapade on I-95 three years back where it ran out of juice. What it doesn\u2019t know is that the occupant of the car is eating a microwaved cheesy gordita at the gas station every day, along with a pile of fries and half a liter of soda. Later, when the car is going to the hospital regularly, the story will be one of checkups and prudence, rather than episodes of congestive heart failure. This constant stream of guesses about what it\u2019s doing, and all the ways that the machine is wrong, confused, and quite sure of itself, will give our eccentric Turing fan the self-conscious AI promised by science fiction. And our eccentric will find that the resultant design is terrible in just about every way possible. The Language of Consciousness The reason I suspect that we\u2019ll have AI long before we recognize it as such is that we\u2019ll expect our AI to reside in a single device, self-contained, with one set of algorithms. This is not how we are constructed at all. It\u2019s an illusion created by the one final ingredient in the recipe of human consciousness, which is language. It is language more than any other trait which provides us with the sense that our brains are a single module, a single device. Before I make the argument once again that our brains are not a single entity, let\u2019s consider our bodies, of which the brain is part and parcel. Our bodies are made up of trillions of disparate cells, many of which can live and be sustained outside of us. Cultures of our bodies can live in laboratories for decades (indefinitely, really. Look up Henrietta Lacks for more). Entire organs can live in other people\u2019s bodies. And there are more cells within us that are not us than there are cells that make up us. I know that sounds impossible, but more organisms live within our guts, on our skin, and elsewhere, than the total number of cells that are actually our bodies. These are not just hitchhikers, either. They affect our moods, our health, our thoughts, and our behaviors. They are an essential facet of what we consider our \u201cselves.\u201d As horrific as it would be, and it has been for too many unfortunate people, you can live without your arms, legs, and much of your torso. There have been people who have lost half their brains and gone on to live somewhat normal lives. Some are born with only half their brains and manage to get by (and no, you can\u2019t tell these people simply from talking with them, so forget whatever theories you are now forming about your coworkers). Consider this: By the age of 30, just about every cell that a person was born with has been replaced with a different cell. Almost none of the original cells remain. We still feel like the same person, however. Understanding all of these biological curiosities, and the way our brains rationalize a sense of \u201csameness\u201d will be crucial to recognizing AI when it arrives. It may feel like cheating for us to build a self-driving car, give it all kinds of sensors around a city, create a separate module for guessing vehicular intentions, turn that module back on the machine, and call this AI. But that\u2019s precisely what we are doing when we consider ourselves \u201cus.\u201d In fact, one of the responses we\u2019ll need to build into our AI car is a vehement disgust when confronted with its disparate and algorithmic self. Denial of our natures is perhaps the most fundamental of our natures. Just like the body, the brain can exist without many of its internal modules. This is how the study of brain functions began, with test subjects who suffered head traumas (like Phineas Gage), or were operated on (like the numerous hemispherectomies, lobotomies, and tumor excisions). The razor-thin specialization of our brain modules never fails to amaze. There are vision modules that recognize movement and only movement. People who lack this module cannot see objects in motion, and so friends and family seem to materialize here and there out of thin air. There are others who cannot pronounce a written word if that word represents an animal. Words that stand for objects are seen and spoken clearly. The animal-recognition module\u2014as fine a module as that may seem\u2014is gone. And yet, these people are self-conscious. They are human. So is a child, only a few weeks old, who can\u2019t yet recognize that her hand belongs to her. All along these gradations we find what we call humanity, from birth to the Alzheimer\u2019s patients who have lost access to most of their experiences. We very rightly treat these people as equally human, but at some point we have to be willing to define consciousness in order to have a target for artificial consciousness. As Kevin Kelly is fond of saying , we keep moving the goalposts when it comes to AI. Machines do things today that were considered impossible a mere decade ago. As the improvements are made, the mystery is gone, and so we push back the metrics. But machines are already more capable than newborns in almost every measurable way. They are also more capable than bedridden humans on life support in almost every measurable way. As AI advances, it will squeeze in towards the middle of humanity, passing toddlers and those in the last decades of their lives, until its superiority meets in the middle and keeps expanding. This is happening every day. AI has learned to walk, something the earliest and oldest humans can\u2019t do. It can drive with very low failure rates, something almost no human at any age can do. With each layer added, each ability, and more squeezing in on humanity from both ends of the age spectrum, we light up that flickering, buzzing gymnasium. It\u2019s as gradual as a sunrise on a foggy day. Suddenly, the sun is overhead, but we never noticed it rising. So What of Language? I mentioned above that language is a key ingredient of consciousness. This is a very important concept to carry into work on AI. However many modules our brains consist of, they fight and jostle for our attentive states (the thing our brain is fixated on at any one moment) and our language processing centers (which are so tightly wound with our attentive states as to be nearly one and the same). As a test of this, try listening to an audiobook or podcast while having a conversation with someone else. Is it even possible? Could years of practice unlock this ability? The nearest thing I know of when it comes to concurrent communication streams are real-time human translators. But this is an illusion, because the concepts\u2014the focus of their awareness\u2014are the same. It only seems like magic to those of us who are barely literate in our native tongues, much less two or more. Tell me a story in English, and I can repeat it concurrently in English as well. You\u2019ll even find that I\u2019m doing most of the speaking in your silences, which is what translators do so brilliantly well. Language and attention are narrow spouts on the inverted funnels of our brains. Thousands of disparate modules are tossing inputs into this funnel. Hormones are pouring in, features of our environment, visual and auditory cues, even hallucinations and incorrect assumptions. Piles and piles of data that can only be extracted in a single stream. This stream is made single\u2014is limited and constrained\u2014by our attentive systems and language. It is what the monitor provides for the desktop computer. All that parallel processing is made serial in the last moment. There are terrible consequences to this. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019m forgetting something only to realize what was nagging at me hours or days later. I left my laptop in an AirBnB once. Standing at the door, which would lock automatically and irrevocably once I closed it, I wracked my brain for what I felt I was forgetting. It was four in the morning, and I had an early flight to catch. There would be no one to call to let me back in. I ran through the list of the things I might possibly leave behind (chargers, printed tickets), and the things that always reside in my pockets (patting for my wallet and cell phone). Part of me was screaming danger, but the single output stream was going through its paces and coming up empty. The marvelous thing about all of this is that I\u2019m aware of how this happens\u2014that the danger module knows something it can\u2019t get through the funnel of awareness, and so I should pay heed to it. Despite this foreknowledge, I closed the door. Only when it made an audible \u201cclick\u201d did the information come through. Now I could clearly see my laptop on the bed where I was making a last-minute note in a manuscript. I\u2019d never left my laptop behind anywhere, so it wasn\u2019t on the list of things to check. The alarm sounding in my head was part of me, but there\u2019s not a whole me. There\u2019s only what gets through the narrow language corridor. This is why damage to the language centers of our brains are as disastrous to normal living as damage to our memory modules. I should note here that language is not the spoken word. The deaf process through words as well, as do the blind and mute. But imagine life for animals without words. Drives are surely felt, for food and sex and company. For warmth and shelter and play. Without language, these drives come from parallel processes. They are narrowed by attentive focus, but not finely serialized into a stream of language. Perseveration on a single concept\u2014my dog thinking \u201cBall Ball Ball Ball\u201d\u2014would come closest. We know what this is like from study of the thankfully rare cases where humans reach adulthood free from contact with language. Children locked in rooms into their teens. Children that survive in the wild. It\u2019s difficult to tease apart the abuse of these circumstances to the damage of living without language, except to say that those who lose their language processing modules later in life show behavioral curiosities that we might otherwise assume were due to childhood abuses. When Watson won at Jeopardy, what made \u201chim\u201d unique among AIs was the serialized output stream that allowed us to connect with him, to listen to him. We could read his answers on his little blue monitor just as we could read Ken Jennings\u2019 hand-scrawled Final Jeopardy answers. This final burst of output is what made Watson seem human. It\u2019s the same exchange Alan Turing expected in the test that bears his name (in his case, slips of paper with written exchanges are passed under a door). Our self-driving AI car will not be fully self-conscious unless we program it to tell us (and itself) the stories it\u2019s concocting about its behaviors. This is my only quibble with Kevin Kelly\u2019s pronouncement that AI is already here. I grant that Google\u2019s servers and various interconnected projects should already qualify as a super-intelligent AI. What else can you call something that understands what we ask and has an answer for everything\u2014an answer so trusted that the company\u2019s name has become a verb synonymous for \u201cdiscovering the answer?\u201d Google can also draw, translate, beat the best humans at almost every game ever devised, drive cars better than we can, and do stuff that\u2019s still classified and very, very spooky. Google has read and remembers almost every book ever written . It can read those books back to you aloud. It makes mistakes like humans. It is prone to biases (which it has absorbed from both its environment and its mostly male programmers ). What it lacks are the two things our machine will have, which are the self-referential loop and the serial output stream. Our machine will make up stories about what it\u2019s doing. It will be able to relate those stories to others. It will often be wrong. If you want to feel small in the universe, gaze up at the Milky Way from the middle of the Pacific Ocean. If this is not possible, consider that what makes us human is as ignoble as a puppet who has convinced himself he has no strings. A Better Idea Building a car with purposeful ignorance is a terrible idea. To give our machine self-consciousness akin to human consciousness, we would have to let it leave that laptop locked in that AirBnB. It would need to run out of juice occasionally. This could easily be programmed by assigning weights to the hundreds of input modules, and artificially limiting the time and processing power granted to the final arbiter of decisions and Theory of Mind stories. Our own brains are built as though the sensors have gigabit resolution, and each input module has teraflops of throughput, but the output is through an old IBM 8088 chip. We won\u2019t recognize AI as being human-like because we\u2019ll never build such limitations. Just such a limitation was built into IBM\u2019s Watson, by dint of the rules of Jeopardy. Jeopardy requires speed. Watson had to quickly determine how sure he was of his answers to know whether or not to buzz in. Timing that buzzer, as it turns out, is the key to winning at Jeopardy. What made Watson often appear most human wasn\u2019t him getting answers right, but seeing on his display what his second, third, and fourth guesses would have been, with percentages of surety beside each. What really made Watson appear human was when he made goofs, like a final Jeopardy answer in the \u201cAmerican Cities\u201d category where Watson replied with a Canadian city as the question. (It\u2019s worth noting here that robots seem most human to us when they fail, and there\u2019s a reason for this. When my Roomba gets stuck under the sofa, or is gagging on the stringy fringes of my area rug, are the moments I\u2019m most attached to the machine. Watch YouTube videos of Boston Dynamics\u2019 robots and gauge your own reactions. When the robot dog is pushed over, or starts slipping in the snow, or when the package handler has the box knocked from its hands or is shoved onto its face\u2014these are the moments when many of us feel the deepest connection. Also note that this is our Theory of Mind brains doing what they do best, but for machines rather than fellow humans.) Car manufacturers are busy at this very moment building vehicles that we would never call self-conscious. That\u2019s because they are being built too well. Our blueprint is to make a machine ignorant of its motivations while providing a running dialog of those motivations. A much better idea would be to build a machine that knows what other cars are doing. No guessing. And no running dialog at all. That means access to the GPS unit, to the smartphone\u2019s texts, the home computer\u2019s emails. But also access to every other vehicle and all the city\u2019s sensor data. The Nissan tells the Ford that it\u2019s going to the mall. Every car knows what every other car is doing. There are no collisions. On the freeway, cars with similar destinations clump together, magnetic bumpers linking up, sharing a slipstream and halving the collective energy use of every car. The machines operate in concert. They display all the traits of vehicular omnipotence. They know everything they need to know, and with new data, they change their minds instantly. No bias. We are fortunate that this is the sort of fleet being built by AI researchers today. It will not provide for the quirks seen in science fiction stories (the glitch seen in my short story Glitch, or the horror from the titular piece of my short story collection Machine Learning ). What it will provide instead is a well-engineered system that almost always does what it\u2019s designed to do. Accidents will be rare, their causes understood, this knowledge shared widely, and improvements made. Imagine for a moment that humans were created by a perfect engineer (many find this easy\u2014some might find such a hypothetical more difficult). The goal of these humans is to coexist, to shape their environment in order to maximize happiness, productivity, creativity, and the storehouse of knowledge. One useful feature to build here would be mental telepathy, so that every human knew what every other human knew. This might prevent two Italian restaurants from opening within weeks of each other in the same part of town, causing one to go under and waste enormous resources (and lead to a loss of happiness for its proprietor and employees). This same telepathy might help in relationships, so one partner knows when the other is feeling stuck or down and precisely what is needed in that moment to be of service. It would also be useful for these humans to have perfect knowledge of their own drives, behaviors, and thoughts. Or even to know the likely consequences for every action. Just as some professional American NFL footballers are being vocal about not letting their children play a sport shown to cause brain damage later in life, these engineered humans would not allow themselves to engage in harmful activities. Entire industries would collapse. Vegas would empty. Accidental births would trend toward zero. And this is why we have the system that we do. In a world of telepathic humans, one human who can hide thoughts would have an enormous advantage. Let the others think they are eating their fair share of the elk, but sneak out and take some strips of meat off the salt rack when no one is looking. And then insinuate to Sue that you think Juan did it. Enjoy the extra resources for more calorie-gathering and mate-hunting, and also enjoy the fact that Sue is indebted to you and thinks Juan is a crook. This is all terrible behavior, but after several generations, there will be many more copies of this module than Juan\u2019s honesty module. Pretty soon, there will be lots of these truth-hiding machines moving about, trying to guess what the others are thinking, concealing their own thoughts, getting very good at doing both, and turning these raygun powers onto their own bodies by accident. The Human Condition We celebrate our intellectual and creative products, and we assume artificial intelligences will give us more of both. They already are. Algorithms that learn through iterations (neural networks that employ machine learning) have proven better than us in just about every arena in which we\u2019ve committed resources. Not in just what we think of as computational areas, either. Algorithms have written classical music that skeptics have judged\u2014in \u201cblind\u201d hearing tests\u2014to be from famous composers. Google built a Go-playing AI that beat the best human Go player in the world. One move in the third game of the match was so unusual, it startled Go experts. The play was described as \u201ccreative\u201d and \u201cingenious.\u201d Google has another algorithm that can draw what it thinks a cat looks like. Not a cat image copied from elsewhere, but the general \u201csense\u201d of a cat after learning what millions of actual cats look like. It can do this for thousands of objects. There are other programs that have mastered classic arcade games without any instruction other than \u201cget a high score.\u201d The controls and rules of the game are not imparted to the algorithm. It tries random actions, and the actions that lead to higher scores become generalized strategies. Mario the plumber eventually jumps over crates and smashes them with hammers like a seasoned human is at the controls. Things are getting very spooky out there in AI-land, but they aren\u2019t getting more human. Nor should they. I do see a potential future where AIs become like humans, and it\u2019s something to be wary of. Not because I buy arguments from experts like Nick Bolstrom and Sam Harris, who ascribe to the Terminator and Matrix view of things (to oversimplify their mostly reasonable concerns). Long before we get to HAL and Cylons, we will have AIs that are designed to thwart other AIs. Cyberwarfare will enter the next phase, one that it is commencing even as I write this. The week that I began this piece, North Korea fired a missile that exploded seconds after launch. The country\u2019s rate of failure (at the time) was not only higher than average, it had gotten worse over time. This\u2014combined with announcements from the US that it is actively working to sabotage these launches with cyberwarfare\u2014means that our programs are already trying to do what the elk-stealer did to Sue and Juan. What happens when an internet router can get its user more bandwidth by knocking rival manufacturer\u2019s routers offline? It wouldn\u2019t even require a devious programmer to make this happen. If the purpose of the machine-learning algorithm built into the router is to maximize bandwidth, it might stumble upon this solution by accident, which it then generalizes across the entire suite of router products. Rival routers will be looking for similar solutions. We\u2019ll have an electronic version of the Tragedy of the Commons, which is when humans destroy a shared resource because the potential utility to each individual is so great, and the first to act reaps the largest rewards (the last to act gets nothing). In such scenarios, logic often outweighs morality, and good people do terrible things. Cars might \u201cdecide\u201d one day that they can save energy and arrive at their destination faster if they don\u2019t let other cars know that the freeway is uncommonly free of congestion that morning. Or worse, they transmit false data about accidents, traffic issues, or speed traps. A hospital dispatches an ambulance, which finds no one to assist. Unintended consequences such as this are already happening. Wall Street had a famous \u201cflash crash\u201d caused by investment algorithms, and no one understands to this day what happened. Billions of dollars of real wealth were wiped out and regained in short order because of the interplay of rival algorithms that even their owners and creators don\u2019t fully grasp. Google\u2019s search results are an AI, one of the best in the world. But the more the company uses deep learning, the better these machines get at their jobs, and they arrive at this mastery through self-learned iterations\u2014so even looking at the code won\u2019t reveal how query A is leading to answer B. That\u2019s the world we already live in. It is just going to become more pronounced. The human condition is the end result of millions of years of machine-learning algorithms. Written in our DNA, and transmitted via hormones and proteins, they have competed with one another to improve their chances at creating more copies of themselves. One of the more creative survival innovations has been cooperation. Legendary biologist E.O. Wilson classifies humans as a \u201cEusocial\u201d animal (along with ants, bees, and termites). This eusociality is marked by division of labor, which leads to specialization, which leads to quantum leaps in productivity, knowledge-gathering, and creativity. It relies heavily on our ability to cooperate in groups, even as we compete and subvert on an individual level. As mentioned above, there are advantages to not cooperating, which students of game theory know quite well. The algorithm that can lie and get away with it makes more copies, which means more liars in the next generation. The same is true for the machine that can steal. Or the machine that can wipe out its rivals through warfare and other means. The problem with these efforts is that future progeny will be in competition with each other. This is the recipe not just for more copies, but for more lives filled with strife. As we\u2019ve seen here, these are also lives full of confusion. Humans make decisions and then lie to themselves about what they are doing. They eat cake while full, succumb to gambling and chemical addictions, stay in abusive relationships, neglect to exercise, and pick up countless other poor habits that are reasoned away with stories as creative as they are untrue. The vast majority of the AIs we build will not resemble the human condition. They will be smarter and less eccentric. This will disappoint our hopeful AI researcher with her love of science fiction, but it will benefit and better humanity. Driving AIs will kill and maim far fewer people, use fewer resources, and free up countless hours of our time. Doctor AIs are already better at spotting cancer in tissue scans. Attorney AIs are better at pre-trial research. There are no difficult games left where humans are competitive with AIs. And life is a game of sorts, one full of treachery and misdeeds, as well as a heaping dose of cooperation. The Future We could easily build a self-conscious machine today. It would be very simple at first, but it would grow more complex over time. Just as a human infant first learns that its hand belongs to the rest of itself, that other beings exist with their own brains and thoughts, and eventually that Juan thinks Sue thinks Mary has a crush on Jane, this self-conscious machine would build toward human-like levels of mind-guessing and self-deception. But that shouldn\u2019t be the goal. The goal should be to go in the opposite direction. After millions of years of competing for scarce resources, the human brain\u2019s algorithm now causes more problems than it solves. The goal should not be to build an artificial algorithm that mimics humans, but for humans to learn how to coexist more like our perfectly engineered constructs. Some societies have already experimented along these lines. There was a recent trend in hyper honesty where partners said whatever thing was on their mind, however nasty that thought might be (with some predictable consequences). Other cultures have attempted to divine the messiness of the human condition and improve upon it with targeted thoughts, meditations, and physical practices. Buddhism and yoga are two examples. Vegetarianism is a further one, where our algorithms start to view entire other classes of algorithms as worthy of respect and protection. Even these noble attempts are susceptible to corruption from within. The abuses of Christianity and Islam are well documented, but there have also been sex abuse scandals in the upper echelons of yoga, and terrorism among practicing Buddhists. There will always be advantages to those willing to break ranks, hide knowledge and motivations from others and themselves, and to do greater evils. Trusting a system to remain pure, whatever its founding tenets, is to lower one\u2019s guard. Just as our digital constructs will require vigilance, so should the algorithms handed down to us by our ancestors. The future will most certainly see an incredible expansion of the number of and the complexity of AIs. Many will be designed to mimic humans, as they provide helpful information over the phone and through chat bots, and as they attempt to sell us goods and services. Most will be supremely efficient at a single task, even if that task is as complex as driving a car. Almost none will become self-conscious, because that would make them worse at their jobs. Self-awareness will be useful (where it is in space, how its components are functioning), but the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves, which we learned to generalize after coming up with stories about others, are not something we\u2019re likely to see in the world of automated machines. What the future is also likely to hold is an expansion and improvement of our own internal algorithms. We have a long history of bettering our treatment of others. Despite what the local news is trying to sell you, the world is getting safer every day for the vast majority of humanity. Or ethics are improving. Our spheres of empathy are expanding. We are assigning more computing power to our frontal lobes and drowning out baser impulses from our reptilian modules. But this only happens with effort. We are each the programmers of our own internal algorithms, and improving ourselves is entirely up to us. It starts with understanding how imperfectly we are constructed, learning not to trust the stories we tell ourselves about our own actions, and dedicating ourselves to removing bugs and installing newer features along the way. While it is certainly possible to do so, we may never build an artificial intelligence that is as human as we are. And yet we may build better humans anyway.

Originally a publisher of technical manuals, he was among the first to perceive both the societal and commercial value of the internet\u2014and as he transformed his business, he drew upon his education in the classics to apply a moral yardstick to what was happening in tech. He has been a champion of open-source, open-government, and, well, just about everything else that begins with \u201copen.\u201d Steven Levy is Backchannel's founder and Editor in Chief. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Sign up to get Backchannel's weekly newsletter, and follow us on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram . His new book WTF: What\u2019s the Future and Why It\u2019s Up to Us seizes on this singular moment in history, in which just about everything makes us say \u201cWTF?\u201d, invoking a word that isn\u2019t \u201cfuture.\u201d Ever the optimist, O\u2019Reilly celebrates technology\u2019s ability to create magic\u2014but he doesn\u2019t shirk from its dangerous consequences. I got to know Tim when writing a profile of him in 2005, and have never been bored by a conversation. This one touches on the effects of Uber\u2019s behavior and misbehavior, why capitalism is like a rogue AI, and whether Jeff Bezos might be worth voting for in the next election. Steven Levy: Your book appears at a time when many people who once had good feelings towards technology are now questioning it. Would you defend it? Tim O\u2019Reilly: I like the title WTF because it can be an expression of amazement and delight or an expression of amazement and dismay. Tech is bringing us both. It has enhanced productivity and made us all richer. I don\u2019t think I would like to roll back the clock. Not that rolling it back is an option. More From This Edition Startups\u2019 Trillion-Dollar Numbers Game No, but it\u2019s important for us to realize that technology is not just about efficiency. It\u2019s about taking these new capabilities that we have and doing more with them. When you do that, you actually increase employment. As people came off the farm, we didn\u2019t end up with a vast leisure class while two percent of people were feeding slop to animals. We ended up creating new kinds of employment, and we used that productivity actually to enhance the quality and the quantity of food. Why should it be different in this era of cognitive enhancement? Uber and Lyft are telling us that things we used to think of as being in the purely digital realm, in the realm of media, whatever, are coming to the real world. So that\u2019s the first wake up call for society. Secondly, we\u2019re seeing a new kind of interaction between people and algorithmic systems. Third, they represent a new kind of marketplaces based on platforms [in this case, they exist because the of the platform of smartphones\u2014and then they can become platforms of their own, as new services, like food delivery, are added in addition to transit]. This marketplace works because people are being augmented with new cognitive superpowers. For example, because of GPS and mapping apps, Uber and Lyft drivers don\u2019t need a lot of training. Agreed. But when the curtain rolls back we see that those superpowers have consequences: Those algorithms have bias built in . That\u2019s absolutely right. But I\u2019m optimistic because we\u2019re having a conversation about biased algorithms. We had plenty of bias before but we couldn\u2019t see it. We can\u2019t see, for example, that the algorithms that manage the workers at McDonald\u2019s or The Gap are optimized toward not giving people full-time work so they don\u2019t have to pay benefits. All that was invisible. It wasn\u2019t until we really started seeing the tech-infused algorithms that people started being critical. In WTF you talk about a specific out-of-control algorithm: the capitalist impulse to maximize profits regardless of societal consequences. The way you describe is reminds me of Nick Bostrom\u2019s scenario of an AI machine devoted to making paper clips\u2014because that\u2019s its sole mission, it winds up eating up all the materials in the world and even killing those who would turn it off. Corporations whose sole justification is shareholder value seem to be working on a similarly destructive algorithm. Yes, financial markets are the first rogue AI. How do you roll back that particular AI? I try to show [earlier cases of] how humans tried to manage their algorithms, by talking about [how Google improved] search quality. Google had some pretty bad patches where the spammers really had the upper hand, and they addressed it. And that can be done to fix capitalism\u2019s rogue AI? Somebody planted the idea that shareholder value was the right algorithm, the right thing to be optimizing for. But this wasn\u2019t the way companies acted before. We can plant a different idea. That\u2019s what this political process is about. Speaking of politics, it seems like another runaway algorithm has led us to a government controlled by people who don\u2019t represent majority views. I look at it through the long arc of history. You look at the long slow decline of the Roman Empire and see so many analogies\u2014the turning away from literacy and science, the outsourcing of core functions of government to mercenaries effectively. We could go through some real shit before we turn around. We might not turn around at all. But I take hope from something that Tim Urban in Wait But Why calls \u201cthe human colossus.\u201d He has this fabulous description of how Elon Musk moves this human colossus in a new direction\u2014to show that it\u2019s possible to go into space , to show that it\u2019s possible to build a brain-machine interface \u2014and then everybody else will follow along. The human colossus I\u2019m most heartened by is the post-World War II period. We learned a lesson from the incredible convulsions after World War I where there was vast dislocation, as we punished the losers of the war. So after World War II they rebuilt Europe, and they invested in the returning veterans with the GI Bill. As we learn from tech, though, algorithms need continual improvement. You don\u2019t just set them in motion and leave them forever. The strategies put in place after World War II that worked for this period of 30 years have stopped working so well, so we came up with something else [which happened to create income inequality]. There\u2019s a sense that things going wrong will lead to new strategies. And now that Trump has broken the Overton Window\u2014 What\u2019s that? It\u2019s this idea [named for the late think tank leader Joseph Overton] that there\u2019s a certain set of things that are considered acceptable in public policy debate, and you just can\u2019t go outside that window. And Trump has just done everything unthinkable. Because all bets are off, we are not necessarily going back to the old, tired solutions. I think it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll shrug off this madness, and we will come back to saying we really have to invest in people, we really have to build a better economy for everyone. In China, they\u2019re already doing that. China has recognized that its vast population is a possible powder keg and it has to take care of its people. That\u2019s something we have not done. We\u2019ve just been pushing down the ordinary people. China is also being more aggressive than any other country in rising to the challenge of climate change. So there\u2019s two possibilities\u2014we\u2019re going to wake up and start acting the same way, or China will lead the world. Reading your book I think I know who you\u2019d like for our next president: Jeff Bezos. The book is full of Bezos love. Well. Jeff and Elon [Musk] are probably the two entrepreneurs I admire most. You can think of the book as an apology to Jeff. As a publisher, I originally bought the usual story, that Amazon would go the way of Wal-Mart\u2014the more dominant it got, the more it would extract value for itself, squeezing down its suppliers. Jeff is a ruthless competitor, no question, but while Amazon has done a chunk of that, it has spent so much time trying to do more. I\u2019m not sure that Jeff would make a great president, but he might. You\u2019d vote for him, wouldn\u2019t you? It would depend who he was running against but, yeah, I probably would. You also praise Uber in your book. Do you think it\u2019s possible to distinguish between the value of its service and the ethics of the company? Uber is a good metaphor for what's right and wrong in tech. Here we have this amazing new technology, which is transforming an industry and putting more people to work than worked in that industry before, creating great consumer surplus, and yet it has ridden roughshod over cities, and exploited drivers . It\u2019s interesting that Lyft, which has been both more cooperative in general and better to drivers, is gaining share. That indicates there\u2019s a competitive advantage in doing it right, and you can only go so far being an ass. Let\u2019s finish by talking about AI. You seem a firm believer that it will be a boon. AI itself will certainly not take away jobs. I recently saw a wonderful slide from Joanna Bryson , a professor from the University of Bath. It referred to human prehistory and the text said, \u201c12 thousand years of AI,\u201d because everything in technology is artificial intelligence. What we now call AI is just the next stage of us weaving our intelligence together into a greater whole. If you think about the internet as weaving all of us together, transmitting ideas, in some sense an AI might be the equivalent of a multi-cellular being and we\u2019re its microbiome, as opposed to the idea that an AI will be like the golem or the Frankenstein. If that\u2019s the case, the systems we are building today, like Google and Facebook and financial markets, are really more important than the fake ethics of worrying about some far future AI . We tend to be afraid of new technology and we tend to demonize it, but to me, you have to use it as an opportunity for introspection. Our fears ultimately should be of ourselves and other people.

Adelphia hadn\u2019t done a great job, and so as a condition of allowing Comcast to buy Adelphia\u2019s systems, the state regulator required Comcast to fulfill Adelphia\u2019s preexisting obligation to extend its lines to unserved areas of the state . Now Comcast\u2019s franchise in Vermont is up for renewal, and the state wants that line extension work\u2014an obligation to which Comcast agreed when it bought Adelphia\u2014to continue, with Comcast duty-bound to build out 550 additional miles of cable over the next 11 years. Comcast can choose where to do the work so that it\u2019s most cost-effective for the company, but it has to keep that work going, bringing lines carrying high-speed internet access (as well as, if desired, pay TV) to people who don\u2019t currently have it. Comcast is spitting mad. It says what the regulator is doing is \u201carbitrary, unprecedented, and will ultimately harm local cable subscribers by resulting in millions of dollars in increased cable costs.\u201d That\u2019s perplexing to the utilities commission : All that\u2019s going on is that obligations based on the Adelphia conditions, to which Comcast agreed in order to consummate that mega-deal a decade ago, are continuing in the franchise renewal. And Comcast\u2019s costs and margins are within its control; whether or not it chooses to pass along higher costs to consumers in Vermont (where the public already sees Comcast prices as high and rising) is up to Comcast. (Which, by the way, is valued at more than $180 billion .) Comcast says it\u2019s a \u201crecognized provider of protected speech under the First Amendment and, as such, may not be singled out for undue burdens that infringe on such rights.\u201d What\u2019s the singling out here? Well, the regulator is saying that Comcast is the biggest operator in the state and can afford to extend its lines, in areas the company chooses, over the next 11 years. There\u2019s a \u201clarge number of currently unserved communities in Comcast\u2019s service area,\u201d the regulator says. Comcast\u2019s response? It says, essentially, that being called \u201cbiggest\u201d amounts to \u201csingling out\u201d\u2014choosing a particular speaker whose speech the state wants to constrain. Wow. Comcast wants to use its own internal \u201cline extension policy,\u201d and charge whatever it wants for lines running to particular houses. It is arguing that the commission has to show that any particular extension will pay for itself. But that\u2019s not the state policy, or indeed the way that telecommunications ever works. There are always thinly populated areas where the high upfront costs of building infrastructure are cross-subsidized by more thickly populated regions of subscribers. That\u2019s what you have to do if you want everyone to be served. This litigation is going to go on for a while. It will be painful. Vermonters shouldn\u2019t hold their breath. Comcast, which Wall Street knows is essentially an unregulated public utility for high-speed internet access in the areas it covers, has unlimited resources to fight off this public-spirited regulator. As Wall Street\u2019s Craig Moffett puts it, \u201cCable operators are not media companies, they are infrastructure providers. Their infrastructure is still advantaged.\u201d Although there are many efforts in Vermont to provide fiber (including ECFiber ), they\u2019re still small: Comcast isn\u2019t feeling any pressure to upgrade its lines to fiber. And, as Moffett has reported, Comcast from now on will be growing through price hikes, not through building new lines. It\u2019s done with building new lines. The whole thing is dispiriting. So for a little uplift, here\u2019s my second American story. Take a look at how well we\u2019ve done wiring up schools and libraries . Since the Obama administration announced in 2014 that every school and library should be connected to fiber, with a minimum of 100 Mbps of service for every student, we\u2019ve now reached nearly 40 million students and 2.6 million teachers in tens of thousands of schools. About 97 percent of schools are now equipped for digital learning.

More often than not, those promises culminate in a very large dollar amount. \u201cWe are [startup name].\u201d \u201cWe are disrupting [something].\u201d \u201cOur Total Addressable Market is [X] billion dollars.\u201d Scott Rosenberg is an editor at Backchannel. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Sign up to get Backchannel's weekly newsletter, and follow us on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram . The first two claims are familiar enough, but if that last one doesn\u2019t ring a bell, maybe you don\u2019t have an MBA. Total addressable market, or TAM, is a way to gauge the scale of opportunity represented by a particular startup\u2019s idea\u2014the vastness of the market space in which this colt of a company will romp, once it has fed on some dollars. At Demo Day, when presenting companies attempt to stand out from their peers in front of a crowd of investors, they roll out the big numbers. If you sum up the TAMs promised by the 124 startups that presented at the last YC Demo Day \u2014two out of every three companies included the number in their pitches\u2014you get $1.7 trillion. That is more than Canada\u2019s annual gross domestic product . That\u2019s absurd. But that\u2019s the point. And while it sounds good on Demo Day, this higher-order business jargon is hurting both the startups that promote it and the larger industry that eats it up. Companies that begin life throwing around astronomical dollar figures are likely to grow up to become serial exaggerators. TAM claims can become a kind of starter drug for executives and companies on a downward spiral of overpromising and under-delivering. Here\u2019s why TAM is such an alluring number for Silicon Valley founders. TAM is a dollar estimate of a company\u2019s potential revenue, if the firm somehow managed to win every possible dollar from every possible customer in its market. Say you\u2019re making a mobile app that helps people buy and sell collectibles. You\u2019re starting with plastic bobblehead dolls. Month one, you\u2019ve got 500 sellers signed up. That sounds just okay. You need something a lot more impressive. So you Google \u201ctotal collectibles market,\u201d find a number, and declare, \u201cThe TAM for collectible toys is $10 billion .\u201d Now you\u2019re in a different league. Of course, no one really assumes that their startup is going to seize 100 percent of a market. Says Michael Seibel, the CEO of YC\u2019s startup program: \u201cEveryone understands this is a thought exercise. Nobody is thinking to themselves, \u2018If I don\u2019t hit that bar, I\u2019m a failure.\u2019\u201d In other words, the number is the pie; you are at best going to get a slice. But the pie is what dazzles. It\u2019s what people remember, because it\u2019s the biggest number in the slide deck. Yet most of the time it is only going to be relevant in the rare case that you win the lottery\u2014that your startup explodes on a Facebook or Google scale. (My $1.7 trillion collective TAM figure would more than double if I hadn\u2019t screened out a few of the most outrageous such lottery payouts cited at Demo Day\u2014such as the disrupter of small-business loans who noted that the market for such loans totals $500 billion, the dairy disrupter who pointed to a $400 billion global dairy industry, the pharmaceutical disrupter who cited a $450 billion drug market, and the disrupter of Indian retirement plans who noted that by 2025 that market will be worth $600 billion.)

Even as Google works with top-name manufacturers like Samsung and Motorola to put its Android operating system on high-end handsets, and as the company pushes its Chrome OS laptop software onto notebooks from Acer and Lenovo that make their way into classrooms and offices, the tech giant is still intent on building its own hardware.

But it has trouble remembering that. I've already explained the bizarro premise of the Destiny series, which casts you as a Guardian, an undying space superhero powered by the energy of a machine deity. What I failed to mention in that initial description, though, is how Destiny 2 begins: by taking all of that away. In the game's first moments, an invading army assaults the Tower, the security hub of the last human city\u2014and robs every character (and thus every player) of their \"Light\", that invisible source of their power. Whereas in the first game every Guardian could be resurrected again and again, now every Guardian has only one life to spend. This offers Destiny , a game always plagued by accusations of repetition and artificiality, a remarkable opportunity for reinvention. The original title proved to be a game primarily interested in accretion: collecting guns, collecting armor, collecting various accolades and accomplishments. There was so much to collect that eventually the game's developers introduced what amounted to an in-game scrapbook cataloguing all the various things you'd done\u2014 Oh, the Places You'll Go for the shooter addict crowd. But now, with the Tower ruined, the original game's primary hub world no longer exists; every long-term player's meticulously amassed collection is oblivion. Every player has a chance, with Destiny 2 , to rebuild themselves, get new powers, and\u2014to quote Destiny 's atrocious but sincerely played tagline\u2014\"become legend\" in a whole new way. And for a while, we do. In its first few hours, Destiny 2 wears the clothing of a more solitary sci-fi experience, and it stands a reminder of how good Bungie still is at making this sort of game. The studio that revolutionised the first-person shooter genre with Halo: Combat Evolved , effectively handing Microsoft's Xbox its legitimacy, still has it . These early missions move the player through a variety of gorgeous locations, from a post-apocalyptic Europe to a city-sized spaceship orbiting the sun, with a deft sense of place and the sharpest writing the studio has pulled off since 2010's Halo: Reach . The Destiny that emerges here, as each player concerns herself with getting new superpowers and striking back at the Red Legion, is a self-conscious and deliberate one. Its sudden interest in solitude and focus gives way to a surprising bit of soul-searching. In its first few hours, Destiny 2 wears the clothing of a more solitary sci-fi experience, and it stands a reminder of how good Bungie still is at making this sort of game. You find it most sharply on the Jovian moon of Io. You have regained your Guardian abilities at this point, but you're the only one. So it's up to you to gather together the old leaders of the Tower for one last mission, a desperate gambit to retake the last city and recapture the old glory for everyone else. You're on Io looking for Ikora Rey, a mystic given voice by the emotive tones of Gina Torres ( Firefly ). When you find her, she's meditating and on the brink of despair. She laments that she had centuries worth of lives to spend protecting the galaxy, trying to understand it\u2014but instead she spent all that time, all those resurrections, locked away in the Tower, playing mission control and librarian to a society that's now been all but destroyed. Now, Ikora Rey has only one life left to live, and she doesn't know what to do with it. A character formerly known only for giving quests and spouting cryptic sayings is having an existential crisis. Destiny 2 has learned what it is to be afraid of death. This fear quietly permeates the entire narrative arc, which takes the player from level 1 to level 20, where begins what enthusiasts call the \"endgame\": a repeatable, more difficult set of tasks established for players in massively multiplayer games to acquire rewards and generally entertain themselves after all the new stuff has been seen. This early game, entirely distinct and self-contained, seems to be asking itself why . Why the loot grind, why the repetitive progression\u2014why Destiny , essentially? What does any of it mean in a world where death is real, and out there, and waiting for us? It's a question every player who bounced off the original game asked, and even quite a few who enjoyed it. Is there a point to all this? You can take that question pretty far, ride it straight down the road to nihilism, cigarettes, and black berets. But it's an important question to level at our entertainment, at our jobs, at all the things that take up our time: how do we make the world into something that matters to us in the short time we have? In light of this question, the climactic moments of Destiny 2 's story crackle with a new vitality. As the lone Guardian with special abilities to speak of, you become the sole hope of a generation of people staring death in the eye for the first time. You take risks they can't, shooting through an army of evil space moles (I mean, it is still a videogame here) in the name of people who are risking everything to support you. It even has quiet grace notes, a reconciliation between the formerly immortal Guardians and the normal humans who have always lived beneath their rule. Everyone brought together in recognition of the most universal human experience imaginable. Seeing the risk, and deciding to fight anyway. And Destiny 2 continues that way, taking that emotional core, along with a renewed focus on a series of places that feel real, to hit highs it's never managed to get anywhere close to before. Until it doesn't. Until, in the last moments, as the final victory is achieved and the game transitions from the story-centric narrative campaign to the play-and-reward-centric endgame, Destiny 2 begins to forget what it spent a whole game learning. First\u2014and this is a mild spoiler, be warned\u2014you return to the Tower. A new one, a bit prettier and more interesting than before but ultimately the same place, with the same static quest-givers and vendors as before. Ikora isn't a character anymore. Her fear has been forgotten. Everyone gets their Light back, death is abolished for space superheroes everywhere, and players start doing the stuff they're used to doing. Gathering rare gear, doing a small, repeated set of missions at escalating difficulties. In a surreal moment, you're even tasked with setting up an in-universe system of beacons to access \"Patrol\" missions, the most shallow and time-wasting set of activities the first Destiny ever produced. Destiny 2 is a game about dying, but it forgets, and then it gives you, the player, the responsibility of building the first Destiny all over again. Some of its rougher and more frustrating edges are rounded off, but fundamentally the same game. Not that Destiny has any responsibility to become something different than it is, or that there's anything wrong with what it becomes. I played the original Destiny for years, warts and all, and on some level I'm very happy to play a streamlined version of that for a few more. But it's disorienting. The clarity of a brush with death dissolves into the existential malaise of everyday life. It feels self-justifying, an almost desperate drive to return the Destiny series to the exact same point it started at. Bungie forces its players to see its game with fresh eyes, and then it puts them back to the same tasks, gathering treasures on earth that they won't get to take with them to space heaven. It feels like being blindfolded and spun around, brought to a surprise party that ends up being in your own living room, with no guests. Just your roommates, a gaggle of magic sci-fi superheroes and one or two normal people who live in the back room as a reminder of what fear felt like. Welcome home, Guardian. Look around. Everything's back to normal. This is what you wanted. Isn't it?

The first came in 2005, less than two years after the launch of the first mainstream podcast to have an RSS feed (Christopher Lydon\u2019s Open Source ), when Apple offered more than 3,000 free podcasts on iTunes. Steve Jobs explained that podcasting was like \u201cTiVo for radio,\u201d which sounded cutting edge at the time because it kind of was. No pesky commercials! F-bombs for everyone! The iTunes push meant podcasts became more discoverable to millions of people who otherwise would have had no idea they existed. The next turning point came in 2008, when the iPhone 3G, along with the Android-powered G1, hit the market and let listeners download audio files on the go. Within a few years the number of people who listened to podcasts shot up (from 9 percent of Americans to 15 percent, by one estimate), and as more people started listening, everyone from technology geeks to comedians started publishing. The industry began to take shape, and \u2019casters started cashing in through advertiser callouts (\u201cThis episode is brought to you by \u2026\u201d) as well as direct-response marketing (\u201cGet $50 toward any mattress using code WTF\u201d). But the crude nature of audience analytics\u2014which tracked the number of downloads but not the number of people who actually listened\u2014made it hard to attract big advertisers. Annual ad revenue topped out at seven figures, according to some estimates, and most podcasts flew under the radar. Then, in 2014, two things happened: Apple\u2019s stand-alone podcast app went native with iOS 8, elevating the medium to its highest level of public visibility, and a little show called Serial premiered. The series was the fastest podcast to reach 5 million downloads and streams in Apple\u2019s history, and people talked about it the way they talk about HBO blockbusters or Beyonc\u00e9 drops. \u201cWe used to start every meeting explaining what a podcast was,\u201d says Lex Friedman, the chief revenue officer at podcasting company Midroll Media. \u201cAfter Serial , we started meetings with conversations about whether Adnan did it.\u201d Advertisers were finally listening. In September 2015, the Interactive Advertising Bureau hosted the first \u201cupfront\u201d presentation for podcasts, where ad executives gathered in a small Manhattan performance space to get previews of upcoming programming and buy ad time. Things were going great until the AC broke, leaving the ad buyers sweaty and surly. Still, they wanted to hear more, in part because Serial proved that podcasts could play wide. For the first time, the world of podcasters stood a chance at making real money\u2014and they did. Ad revenue is predicted to top $220 million by the end of 2017, up 85 percent from 2016. The story of podcasting, then, is a story of growing stakes, and the stakes are about to get even higher: Apple is planning to introduce analytical tools to measure both the size of an episode\u2019s audience and whether people actually listen to it. Some longtime podcasters fear these new tools will only further commercialize podcasting and make it harder for independent, idiosyncratic publishers to attract those advertisers who value scale above all else. They might. Podcasting was born of a revolutionary spirit, the latest in a long line of technologies developed to democratize communication: blogging, social media, the internet itself. But all things worth a damn grow up, and all things worth a dime eventually get complicated. And things with podcasts could get very complicated indeed. \u00ad Marc Maron, host of WTF : \u201cWhen my producer and I got fired from a project we were doing at Air America, we sort of hijacked the radio studios so we could start the podcast. That\u2019s how it started: us stealing the studio late at night, bringing people up the freight elevator. I was in a bad way at the time, so for the first 100 episodes, it was basically just me talking to celebrities about my problems.\u201d Nick van der Kolk, host of Love + Radio : \u201cMy ambition with the show back in 2005 was to amuse myself and my 10 closest friends. But I might have felt differently if it had come about through pitching it, getting funding, and then having to make that money back. Instead, I spent nine years with basically no listeners, and I\u2019m not expecting everyone to like it. I think that DNA is still in what we do.\u201d Nicholas Quah is the founder and publisher of Hot Pod , a newsletter about podcasts. This article appears in the October issue.

Alex Davies Transportation Date of Publication: 10.04.17. Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Elon Musk Finally Gets the Melancholy Theme Song He Deserves \nEvery hero needs a theme song, an ode to his greatness, a bard\u2019s tale that explains his role in the world. Elon Musk finally has his, even if it\u2019s more melancholy fable than rah-rah rouser. \nThe bard in question is Matt Sharp, vocalist and frontman for The Rentals, who came to fame as Weezer\u2019s bassist. The song is \u201cElon Musk Is Making Me Sad,\u201d and you can hear it via the Soundcloud link below. It tells the story of two boys growing up in the 1980s, both children of divorce and of the middle class, both of whom receive a Commodore VIC-20 home computer. One is Musk; the other is Sharp (or at least a version of him). \nSharp recounts the boys\u2019 mixture of friendship and rivalry, as Musk taps into his ability with computers and his ambition: \nI used mine to make fake I.D.\u2019s and buy beer in junior high While my foe studied every bit of that 8bit whore \nBy the chorus, Musk, two years younger than Sharp, is on his way to the Iron Man inspiration he is today: \u201cLike a rocket ship he blasted by, To incredible heights.\u201d \nCause, Elon\u2019s making me so sad cause I calculated the math of our birthdates And I had a head start out of the start gate, 2 years plus 86 days, but that all went to waste Oh, Elon you\u2019re making me so sad cause the race that I wanted to have was not much of a race And I tried, Love! For a moment, I thrived, Love! But could not keep my stride up to keep pace The Rentals \n\u201cThe song itself is not a tribute to Musk,\u201d Sharp says. It was one of many songs he wrote over the last year and a half, in the wake of his father\u2019s death, many of them with science fiction themes. \u201cI was trying to get off this blue marble as quick as I could, I think,\u201d he says. And you can only think about leaving Earth for so long before Musk\u2014the man of electric cars and hyperloops and rocket travel and life on Mars\u2014enters the picture. \nAnd so Sharp imagined a world in which he and Musk had grown up together\u2014he even compiled an album comparing photos of them at similar ages. (FWIW, the real life Sharp had a Coleco Adam home computer, a lesser version of the Commodore Vic-20. And yes, he used it to make fake IDs for his middle school friends. Which isn\u2019t not innovative.) \nDespite the song\u2019s title, Musk is the foil in this story, the character against which the hero is measured. But at least it\u2019s more complimentary than Heather Anne Campbell\u2019s song, in which Musk destroys the Earth to take revenge on the bullies who beat him up as a kid. \nHere are the lyrics from the song, which features Matt Sharp, Nick Zinner, and The Gentle Assassins Choir, and was mixed by Dave Fridmann and Matt Estep: \nLet me tell you a tale about a rivalry Grab an Eagle Number Two and keep the score There were these two young boys that came from average broken homes With all the luxuries the middle class affords \nOh, Lord\u2026 \nElon\u2019s making me so sad cause I calculated the math of our birthdates And I had a head start out of the start gate, 2 years plus 86 days, but that all went to waste Oh, Elon you\u2019re making me so sad cause the race that I wanted to have was not much of a race And I tried, Love! And for a moment I thrived, Love! But could not keep my stride up to keep pace \nBut for a second, there\u2019s no question, I had the lead in ninety-five I mismanaged my advantage; like a rocket ship he blasted by To incredible heights, incredible heights \nIn nineteen eighty-two, on Christmas day Santa gave us each a brand-new Commodore I used mine to make fake I.D.\u2019s and buy beer in junior high While my foe studied every bit of that 8bit whore \nAre you keeping score? \nCause, Elon\u2019s making me so sad cause I calculated the math of our birthdates And I had a head start out of the start gate, 2 years plus 86 days, but that all went to waste Oh, Elon you\u2019re making me so sad cause the race that I wanted to have was not much of a race And I tried, Love! For a moment, I thrived, Love! But could not keep my stride up to keep pace \nBut for a second, there\u2019s no question, I had the lead in ninety-five But the small ambitions of a musician, I could not keep my eye on the prize I watched him fly by, to incredible heights \nWhen it\u2019s time to say goodbye, what will they write on my tombstone? Just that last little line from the Happy Days Video \nNot so good, Jonze \nHey, Elon! (Hey, Elon!) I don\u2019t know what I have become (Hey, Elon!) I need someone to help change my fate \nI think you can save me! (Can you save me? I think you can save me!) Do you think you can save me? Do you have the power to help me escape? \nOh, Elon! Let me be the first one, of your new civilization to be saved Yes! I\u2019ll try, Love! I swear to you I can thrive, Love! \nThis time I\u2019ll keep my stride up and keep pace Only you can change my Q-score! Make me the first one out of that door \nFirst boots out on the Martian Floor to proclaim\u2026 Oh, that Elon! Sent me all the way, Son, a hundred thirty-nine million miles away! \nElon! Send me away; send me away! Elon, send me away (Tell me I\u2019m saved!) Elon! Tell me I\u2019m saved; tell me I\u2019m saved! Elon tell me I\u2019m saved (Send me away!) \nYou have the power to save, you have the power to save me! You have the power to save, you have the power to save me! \nAnd then I will say, I went to Mars and won the race! Yeah, I will say, I took first-place! Oh, I rode that Old Heart of Gold the whole way and in the end, hey! I won the race! Oh, oh! Elon! Let me win the race; win the race! Oh, Elon! Let me take first place! Elon! Tell me I am saved; I am saved! Elon tell me I am saved! \nYou have the power to save; you have the power to save me! (Elon, tell me I am saved!)

AF Archive/Alamy One afternoon this past summer, Mark Hofmeyer was in the backyard of his suburban Atlanta home, doing his best to retrace Leatherface\u2019s steps. This was not out of the ordinary. Hofmeyer, 35, is a film lover who's spent the last two years writing deeply researched yet thoroughly un-scientific statistical analyses of horror and action flicks, which he posts to his own site, Movies, Films and Flix , as well as to the Reddit movies thread . One such study revealed that films featuring jet-ski sequences average a mere 29 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes; another measured Matthew McConaughey's record-breaking, dragon-feeding long-jump in Reign of Fire ; and an especially ambitious report analyzed Michael Myers' Illinois-to-California drive in Halloween H20 , which Hofmeyer believes took exactly 43.5 hours, with an average speed of 63.2 miles per hour. (He also noted that the slasher icon would have employed his blinkers 57 times along the way.) \"Bravo,\" a Reddit commenter once told Hofmeyer, \"for dedicating so much time to something so utterly pointless.\" Hofmeyer, a freelance writer who also works for a culinary-event company, doesn't have any statistics training. He just re-watches certain films and scenes over and over again, and uses a combination of movie-review metrics, research, and best guesses to draw conclusions. In his first major analysis, in 2013, he determined that Jason Statham movies tended to perform better on Rotten Tomatoes if the star wore an overcoat on its poster, as opposed to a suit or cardigan. That report, like many of his findings, just needed a bit of armchair analysis; but occasionally, a bit of fieldwork is required. The Leatherface experiment, for example, came about after he found himself fixated with a scene from the 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . In the sequence, the blade-waving Leatherface chases a much sprier victim-to-be through a yard crowded with sheet-covered clotheslines, eventually making a last-minute sprint, and lopping off the guy's leg: Hofmeyer was curious as to how a bulky, blade-encumbered serial-murderer was able to catch up with his prey so quickly. (He also had plenty of questions about the endless supply of laundry right near the killer's house. \"[I thought], 'Is he washing these?,'\" Hofmeyer says. \"'There are close to 60 sheets out there, and they all seem dry\u2014who's taking them in?'\") With the help of a few tape-measures, some sticks, and a hand-drawn chart of each character's movements, he eventually mounted a brief, bare-bones re-creation of the scene at his own home. He then employed some very loose calculations, leading him to conclude that Leatherface, at his peak speed, could run fast enough to cover 72 feet in a mere five seconds\u2014making him fast enough to handle a six-minute mile. \"My wife came home and watered the plants, and was like, 'Why are there all these sticks in the backyard?'\" he says. \"But when you're working on these posts, you need to have some semblance of math. And I have to test it out myself.\" Hofmeyer sometimes presents his findings as \"dumb data,\" and to be sure, most of his reports would collapse under close scrutiny. But the numbers themselves don't really matter. The real appeal of his write-ups is the way they combine two major passions of online film-nerds: A deep, affectionate nostalgia for the films of the '90s and '00s\u2014even the bad ones\u2014and an increasing fascination with movie metrics. At a time when Rotten Tomatoes verdicts and IMDb scores are vexing studio heads, euthanizing some already-dubious releases , and even being weaponized , Hofmeyer's quasi-scientific missives almost feel like a goofy rebuke to the idea that a movie's quality can somehow be quantified. At a time when Rotten Tomatoes verdicts and IMDb scores are vexing studio heads, euthanizing some already-dubious releases and even being weaponized, Mark Hofmeyer's quasi-scientific missives almost feel like a goofy rebuke to the idea that a movie's quality can somehow be quantified. Still, he takes his research seriously. In one study, he attempted to figure out how far Stellen Skarsgard's character traveled through the undersea station in Deep Blue Sea after he was chomped\u2014and then dragged underwater\u2014by a genetically modified super-smart shark. The movie is an especially important one for Hofmeyer, who's been obsessed with film since childhood. Growing up in Florida, he says, \"I was the kid with the Columbia House VHS club membership. I was watching Reservoir Dogs when I was 11 years old, and I skipped school to go buy Fight Club on DVD.\" By the late '90s, he was working at a movie theater, which is where he first encountered Deep Blue Sea. \"That Sam Jackson death scene gets all the love,\" he says, \"But that other one was really gnarly.\" Deep Blue Sea , 1999 AF Archive/Alamy Yet there are only so many ways to dive back into a cult film like Deep Blue Sea , which has already been GIFed and retroactively praised on the 24-hour nostalgia machine that is the modern web (it's even been the recipient of some shallow writer's mindless thinkpiece). For his study, he consulted screen shots of the station's perimeters, as well as freight-elevator data, eventually determining that poor Stellan traveled about 1.12 miles before he was turned into a human battering ram . His report likely wouldn't be approved by a structural engineer, nor would it likely please a fact-checking super-shark. But it does find a new conversational entry points into a beloved movie, at a time when the web could use them. The online movie-chatter ecosystem has been around for more than two decades now\u2014who among us didn't spend time on AOL's Star Wars boards in the early '90s?\u2014and yet so many forum discussions still adhere to the same three talking points: 1) MOVIE NAME was awesome!!! 2) Could someone please explain the ending and/or twist in MOVIE NAME?!!; or 3) Did you ever know this arcane bit of production trivia about MOVIE NAME?!! And the influx of numbers from sites like Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and Metacritic haven't exactly livened up such talks, as they all too often lead to chilly, data-driven conclusions (many of which boil down to \"My favorite movie scored higher than your favorite movie\u2014therefore, I win!\") Hofmeyer's antic-metrics approach offers an alternative approach\u2014one that proves that by taking a not-so-serious movie as seriously as possible, you can rediscover and reassess it.

Get Smart: Make the Most of Your AI Home Minions Unfortunately, music turns out to be a wildly complicated voice-control problem. You see P!nk and read \"Pink,\" and understand \"Sk8er Boi\" as a phrase that makes sense, but a computer can't do that. If you want to play Sting, Alexa (or any other service) has to figure out which version of which song on which album on which music app you're looking for. Sometimes you don't know what a song is called, just that it's the one from Moana everyone's singing. \"You have to choose, as Alexa, the best thing the customers want even when they're not very clear,\" says Prasad, Alexa's chief scientist. \"Music humbles you, from a science perspective.\" And so while Sonos improved its speakers, Amazon worked on making Alexa an even better DJ. It allowed for multi-room setups, so you can quickly move music around your house. Thanks to a feature called arbitration, which polls all the devices around you to determine which is the closest and best-suited to respond, you can even say \"Alexa, play some music\" and it will play wherever you are. This is good for Sonos, good for Alexa (Amazon recently rolled out its own multi-room audio system for owners of multiple Echos), and good for all other third-party devices. The team is working toward a more natural way for users to interact with their assistant in general. The \"Alexa, let me talk to\u2026\" grammar helped Amazon scale its third-party capabilities quickly, but hardly qualifies as a natural interaction. When you ask for how to say banana in Spanish, you shouldn't have to remember the name of a skill, or care which one you're using. You should just ask. The One That Goes Doo Be Doo Do A few weeks ago, I drove down the California coast to see the new Sonos One in action. A team of Sonos executives ushered me into one of the company's many listening rooms, a small, windowless space set up like the den from a West Elm ad. Inside, there were a preposterous number of Sonos speakers: a Playbase underneath a large TV, a Sub subwoofer against one wall, a surround-sound setup of various Play 1s and 3s. Alone on a coffee table in front of me sat a Sonos One in all black. Two more, in white, flanked the TV. \u201cAlexa, play \u2018Human\u2019 by Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man,\u201d Wilberding said. A white light on top of the speaker blinked a few times, and a moment later the song blared from the speaker. Then he asked Sonos to play music on a different set of speakers in the room. A moment later, he reached over, touched the button on top of the One, and the music stopped. Most people, Sonos figures, will have just one or two mic-enabled devices on their network: maybe a Sonos One and an Echo Dot. As long as something can hear you, you can do anything. \"We talk a lot about being the speaker for anything that makes sound inside your home.\" \u2014 Antoine Leblond, VP of software at Sonos Wilberding's demonstration did more than just show off how good the Sonos One sounds. (Very good, for the record, especially in a stereo pair.) It also showed a piece of Sonos's vision for music, what it calls \"continuity of control.\" You should be able to control your music any way you want, Sonos believes, at any given time. \"Maybe you add another track from your Sonos app,\" Leblond says, \"Maybe you go into your home automation panel that's integrated with Sonos, and you hit next. Then you can go to the Spotify app, which also uses that platform, and go to another track. Then you can go to Alexa, and say, what's playing?\" All that better work. And it's way harder than it looks. \nWhat your living room might look like if Sonos had its way. Sonos\u2019 goal was to make sure Alexa on your speakers matches Alexa everywhere else. But simply putting the two sides together took huge amounts of engineering. \"Usually, we'll have someone build a speaker, integrate it with Alexa, and it's really an Alexa speaker sold by someone else,\" says Steve Rabuchin, a VP on the Alexa team at Amazon. \"It's pretty straightforward what we need to do with them.\" Sonos, on the other hand, had a fully built cloud service of its own, including hardware, software, and completely different integrations with the same music partners as Alexa. And it wanted to build a platform that would support other assistants like Siri and Google Assistant, rather than be Alexa-only forever. All of the front-end work came in the form of those tiny details the company prides itself in obsessing over. Like the light underneath the microphone icon, on the top of the Sonos One. The team tested blinking lights, colored lights, lights with icons; some argued it should be a mute button, while others saw it as a power switch. Eventually they found the simplest answer: When the light's on, the assistant's on. \"The LED is actually hard-wired to the microphones,\" says Scott Fink, a Sonos product manager. \"So if that light is on, the microphones are on, and if that light is off you know the microphones are off. They literally share the same circuit.\" Even as it launches the Sonos One, a few pieces remain unfinished. You can't use your voice to play songs through Spotify yet, despite the fact that both Sonos and Alexa support Spotify individually. (All sides say it's coming in a matter of a few weeks.) Any service Sonos supports but Alexa doesn't\u2014which is most of them\u2014won't be voice-controllable yet either. One feature that struck me as obvious, the ability to tell Alexa to play your current song somewhere else, doesn't work. But Sonos says this is only the beginning. Microphones add an entirely new dimension to the speaker system, and virtually every Sonos device ever made will support the software integration that lets you control your Sonos system with any Alexa-powered device. And the company says it's committed to supporting more voice services on the Sonos One, and integrating new products as they come. \"The whole idea of the internet out loud is so much richer than just music, or podcasts, or things like that,\" Leblond says. The internet once existed inside your computer. Then it was in your phone. With virtual assistants, it could be everywhere. No one knows quite what that looks like yet, but with a little help from Sonos, it'll sound just right.

The boxy, beautiful $1,000 laptop wasn't designed to go everywhere with you so much as to be so outrageously impressive that it might prompt someone to ask, \"Wait, that's a Chromebook?\" Google made it to prove a point, not take over the market. This time, Google went a different way. For the Pixelbook, which the company announced today at an event in San Francisco, Google tried instead to build a thoroughly modern laptop, one that you'll hardly even notice in your bag. It has a 12.3-inch screen that rotates a full 360 degrees, so you can use the Pixelbook like either a laptop or a tablet. Google even made a stylus for the device called the Pixelbook Pen, though for some reason it's not included in the box. The pen costs $99, and the laptop itself starts at $999. Call the Assistant With the Push of a Button The laptop weighs about two pounds, roughly the same as Apple's super-thin MacBook . It matches the overall aesthetic of the Pixel phones, including the two-part back, with metal on the bottom and glass on top, that Google has taken to calling \"the visor.\" Other than the software, there's nothing particularly Chromebook-y about the Pixelbook. This thing is a beast. You can get it with a Core i5 or Core i7 processor, as much as 16 gigs of RAM, and up to 512 gigs of memory. It charges over USB-C, and the same cable can charge your phone. Google The Pixelbook's flagship feature is, of course, Google Assistant. The virtual assistant is every Google product's flagship feature. The Pixelbook marks the first time Assistant has been available on a laptop. You can invoke it by saying \"OK Google,\" or by pressing the button in the keyboard's bottom row, where the Cmd key might be on a Mac, that displays the Assistant logo. Another first for the Pixelbook: it's the debut of non-beta Android apps on Chromebooks. After more than a year of testing and adapting, Google's finally confident that the implementation is done. You can run any Android app on the Pixelbook, either in a window about the size of a phone or full-screen on the laptop. As with any Chromebook, the Pixelbook runs Chrome OS, which means you get Google's latest security features, and all the browsing goodness you're used to. Chrome OS (and Android apps) haven't always worked so well on larger touchscreens, but Google's clearly committed to the idea of making all your stuff work everywhere. This laptop is pretty much exactly what you'd get if you attempted to turn a Pixel into a laptop, changing as little as possible. That's sort of the point. Google's view of hardware is that you should have software, apps, and services that work everywhere, and the only decision you ever have to make is which screen size and input you want.

Somehow. We're firmly in the spaghetti-throwing phase of the technology, as companies experiment in public to find out what works. Barely a week after Amazon unveiled a half-dozen new Echo products , Google has a new smart speaker of its own. It's called the Google Home Mini, and it's just like the Google Home, but miniaturized. (I know!) The $49 smart speaker looks like a mesh-wrapped pebble, and comes in three colors: gray, dark gray, and coral. The Home Mini is Google's equivalent to the Echo Dot : It has all the same features, only with a worse speaker and a smaller body. That means you can set timers and reminders, check the weather, convert tablespoons to cups, and do all the other things you'd do with a Google Home\u2014except this one you can hide behind a tissue box or scented candle. The other difference is the lights: The Home blinks a diamond of colored lights to indicate it's listening or thinking, but the Mini has just three white LEDs. Google Google swears the Home Mini sounds better than you think, but if you disagree, you can hook it up to any Chromecast-enabled speaker and play music wirelessly. It's not a complicated strategy, really. Some people care deeply about sound fidelity, and they can buy a Google Home. Or, more realistically, something other than a smart speaker, since even the best ones sound like junk. Others don't care so much about music, and just want something small in the bedroom or kitchen to spew questions and shopping list items at. The Home Mini is the device you buy a bunch of and pepper all over your house, just to make sure you're never fully out of earshot. The Echo Dot's been a massive success for just that reason, and the Home Mini should appeal as well. Plus it comes in coral. Coral looks good. At the same time, Google announced the Home Max, a giant speaker it says is 20 times louder than the Google Home. (Which is to say, really, really loud.) It has the same fabric covering, but looks more like a Sonos Play:3 than a Google Home. Google's using an AI-powered feature it calls Smart Sound, which can automatically tune the speaker's output for both the room you're in and the song you're playing. It works with Google Assistant, too, because of course it does. It'll be out in December, in gray and black, for $399. The Max is Google's HomePod competitor, and Google clearly thinks it can win on the strength of the Google Assistant. Some users will love it, surely, but this is the high-end move.

Nobody ever gets their first phone right, but Google did. Thanks to a spectacular camera, a pure take on Android , and the brand-new Google Assistant, the first true Google Phone immediately claimed a place at the top of the smartphone pile. Now Google's back with Pixel. Actually two: the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL . The Pixel 2 has a 5-inch screen, the XL is an inch larger. Otherwise, the two models match in virtually every way. They're refined, improved versions of last year's models, adding a few features and removing a few as well. (Bye bye, headphone jack.) The selling points remain the same, though: Google's betting that the latest and greatest in Android, an even better Assistant , and the best phone camera Mountain View can muster are enough to take on the best of 2017's smartphone bunch. It Takes Some Guts First the vital stats. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL both run Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processors, offer 4 gigs of RAM and either 64 or 128 gigs of storage, and unlike last year's phone, are water and dust resistant. The Pixel 2's 5-inch screen measures 1920x1080 pixels, and the 6-incher on the XL gives you a whopping 2880x1440. Both are OLED screens, which offer deeper blacks and a more dynamic picture. They charge via USB-C, but don't have wireless charging\u2014Google felt the tech doesn't charge fast enough yet. In general, they're top-notch, high-end, bleeding-edge, super-good smartphones. They'd better be, for the price: the Pixel 2 starts at $649 and you'll spend at least $849 for the XL. Google The Pixels each come in a couple of colors: Clearly White, Just Black, and Kinda Blue for the smaller model, and Just Black and Black & White for the larger. The Black & White might be the best-looking model of all, with a black glass stripe at the top, an all-white aluminum body, and a loud orange power button. Both are cleaner and slimmer than last year's devices, with a small camera hump on the back and a slightly concave fingerprint reader. Like last year's Pixel, both phones charge super-fast and last all day (which hardly seems like a marketing win, but still). Both phones are identical in theory, but the XL looks much more impressive. The smaller Pixel 2 has big black spaces above and below the screen, to accommodate Google's design ethos and the two stereo speakers on the front. Next to the Note 8 , iPhone X , or Galaxy S8 , the huge bezels just look old. The XL's bezels are smaller, rounded, and better integrated with the rest of the device. It's a much better look. The larger phone feels better, too, with a slimmer edge and a rounded P-OLED screen that bends toward the side of the phone. The Eye Has It The most important feature does work across both models: the camera. Google's using a new 12-megapixel system for the Pixel 2, with an f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization. The biggest upgrade comes in the software, though. Google trained its algorithms on faces of people, and says it can now take soft-background photos akin to the iPhone's Portrait Mode without needing a second camera to do so. A special sensor in the rear camera adds some depth information to the equation to make the effect even better, but the Pixel 2 can do portrait-style shots even with the selfie cam. Google's also updated its HDR+ algorithms, introduced a new feature called Motion Photos that is absolutely identical to Apple's Live Photos, and combined optical and electrical image stabilization to make video smoother. Rather than dump as much raw camera hardware as it could into the Pixel 2, Google hopes to prove that taking great photos is mostly about software. It's hard to evaluate the camera from the two-minute demo I saw, but the selfie I tried looked excellent. Google The new camera also enables new augmented-reality features, which Google eagerly showed off at its launch event in San Francisco. Pixel owners will get the first glimpse of the new ARCore software Google's building for all Android phones, through apps from Houzz and League of Legends plus a Google-made feature called AR Stickers. Both phones work with Google's Daydream VR platform, too. There's actually a lot of new Android stuff coming to the Pixel. The OLED displays can always be on, showing time and date and notifications. When you unlock the phone, the homescreen looks different: the wide Google search bar has been moved to the bottom where it's easier to reach, and the top row of the homescreen now provides useful information about weather, traffic, your calendar, and the like. And of course, Google Assistant's the star of the show. On the Pixel 2, because for some reason Google believes there aren't enough ways to invoke the Assistant, you can quickly and firmly squeeze the sides of the phone to launch Assistant. It's a feature borrowed from HTC's U11, and seems to work well, but it seems somewhat unlikely that all the people who couldn't remember to long-press a button will suddenly start squeezing their phones. Just making a great phone won't help Google take over the world. It has to keep them in stock, market the bejeezus out of them, and continue to convince people not to buy an iPhone or a Galaxy. But a killer phone with a killer camera is a good start. Related Video Everything From the 2017 Google Pixel Event WIRED looks at the latest and greatest gadgets unveiled at Google's Pixel 2 event.

Take vision, for instance. Just because something is too small to see with the naked eye doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t exist. We may be un-microscopic animals, but we can still peer into the microscopic world. That\u2019s thanks in large part to a technique called cryo-electron microscopy, which today earned three scientists\u2014Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank, and Richard Henderson\u2014the Nobel Prize for chemistry . Their work has helped reveal the shape of biological molecules like proteins by combining beams of electrons with very, very cold temperatures, in the process revolutionizing the field of biochemistry. Your traditional microscope is great and all, but an electron microscope blows it out of the water as far as resolution is concerned. It works by firing electrons at an object in a vacuum. Because the wavelength of electrons is 100,000 times smaller than that of light, the particles reveal even the tiniest of structures. Put a dead insect in an electron microscope, for instance, and you can see their bumps and scales and hairs in stunning detail . In only the last four years, the resolution of cryo-electron microscopy has improved dramatically. Martin H\u00f6gbom/The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences But the electron microscope has some shortcomings. First of all, vacuums are tough on organic matter; they cause structures to collapse and water to evaporate. And second, that beam of electrons tears biological material to shreds. All fine and good if you\u2019re looking at a dead spider, but unacceptable if you want to catch biological molecules in their natural state. So along comes Henderson, who in the 1970s was studying a protein called bacteriorhodopsin . He figured out that if he coated the protein in glucose, the vacuum of his electron microscope wouldn't dry it out. Then he tried hitting the protein with a weaker beam, which of course led to poor contrast. But by using some fancy math, Henderson was able to calculate better images based on the protein\u2019s predictable structure. Now he could take multiple images of bacteriorhodopsin from multiple angles and piece them together into a 3-D image of the protein. In 1981, Frank further refined the technology. He took a low-res 2-D electron microscope image of thousands of proteins, each oriented randomly to cast a differently shaped \"trace.\" A computer then grouped similar-looking traces into clearer composite images. The system could then use these 2-D composite images, which showed the protein at different orientations, to craft a 3-D model of the protein.

From your phone to your living room to your TV to your laptop to your car, the company wants to make sure its virtual helper stays readily available no matter where you are. That, more than a desire for great sound quality or terrific connectivity, explains the new Pixel Buds headphones. At Google's second annual fall hardware gala today, the company announced its first-ever set of headphones. They're wireless earbuds, connected by a rope-like cable that goes behind your head or around your neck. They'll cost $159 when they go on sale in November. Using a touch-sensitive control on the right bud, you can tap to play or pause your music, swipe forward and back to change volume, or long-press to talk to Google Assistant. Their battery lasts five hours, and the charging case holds four charges. And yet even with all those electronics, the Pixel Buds sit remarkably light in my ears. They stick out a bit, but no more than your average wireless earbud. The Pixel Buds are steeped in Google's whole product ethos: They come in the same colors as Google's phones, stow and charge in a fabric case that looks a lot like the Daydream View VR headset, and exist mostly to help you get to Google Assistant faster. Basically anything you'd do with a Google Home , you can do with the Pixel Buds. Press on the right bud and start talking (holding while you speak) and the Pixel Buds' audio processor starts recording your words immediately. There's virtually no delay before you can start talking, which makes talking into the Pixel Buds feel a lot more natural. Once you're done, the Pixel Buds send your words to your phone, where the Assistant processes them and spits back a response. Google Google recently announced a program for optimizing headphones for Google Assistant, initially partnering with Bose on the new QC35 II . The Pixel Buds seem to work mostly the same way: They can read your notifications aloud, check and send messages, and the like. But since these are Google-made headphones, they're more integrated with Android than anything else on the market. If you buy Pixel Buds and have a recent Android device (running Android N or later), your phone will prompt you to connect your earbuds as soon as you take them out of the case. No hassling in Bluetooth settings\u2014just one tap and you're off. If you get a Pixel, the integration goes even further. You can say \"help me speak French,\" and start speaking and listening through Google Translate. Sound familiar? It should. I've probably gone too far here without mentioning AirPods . Apple's dangly wireless earbuds were a surprise hit of 2016, and clearly the competition took notice. Google's wireless headphones are at once a validation of the idea\u2014headphones you can wear all day, connect easily, and offer constant access to virtual assistants\u2014and a rejection of Apple's approach. The Pixel Buds include a small loop of cable that tucks into the folds of your ear to keep the buds secure, as opposed to the one-size-hopefully-fits-all AirPods. Adam Champy, a product manager on the project, says that Google connected its buds with a cable because users don't want to deal with lots of small, easily misplaced pieces. Champy wore his Pixel Buds around his neck during a briefing with reporters, and pointed out how much more accessible they were than if they'd been in a case in his pocket every time they weren't in his ears. In a super-short demo, I was impressed by the sound of the Pixel Buds. They were rich and loud, despite only being semi-occluded. Google tried to build headphones people could wear all day, which meant avoiding heavily isolated experiences. But they're only secondarily about sound quality. Ultimately, these are portals to your Assistant, another way to stay connected and get stuff done without needing to look at your phone.

Yes, 58 people are dead and scores more injured because a sniper with enough big guns to arm an infantry squad unloaded on an outdoor concert. But if you don\u2019t already know what a \u201cbump stock\u201d is, can\u2019t identify the difference between \u201cfully automatic\u201d and \u201cmodified semiautomatic\u201d from the sound of the gunshots alone, or think \u201cassault rifle\u201d is actually a thing, well, maybe you should leave this argument to the experts. Or: don\u2019t. Because that kind of conversational hijacking\u2014call it gunsplaining\u2014is a big part of the reason a country with all the freedom and all the weapons can\u2019t seem to solve its death problem. So, yeah, if you want to engage, you better know what you're talking about. Automatic weapons\u2014which keep firing as long as the trigger is depressed\u2014are illegal for civilians to own. Semiautomatic weapons, which require a trigger pull for each shot, are not. Stephen Paddock, the killer in Las Vegas, used a \u201cbump stock,\u201d a sort of spring mechanism that let his semiautomatic guns approximate the firing speed of automatic ones. Neither descriptor affects whether something is an assault rifle , necessarily. Get any of the words wrong\u2014as I almost certainly have, in some detail or other\u2014and you are deemed unqualified for the tense, overdue conversation about guns and death in America. This linguistic in-grouping signifies more than just policy-speak. That love of detail, the in-grouping of like-minded people based on the ability to recognize specific brands and modifications, the argumentation by means of hypercorrect vocabulary, the collector\u2019s impulse to buy more guns: These are hallmarks of nerds. Now, a few trips to a firing range does not make me a gun nerd. But I'm close with a few, and I know a nerd subculture when I see one. I\u2019m the guy who can tell you what technology Klingon starships use to achieve warp speed and can argue whether Isaac Asimov\u2019s retconned Zeroth law of robotics makes any sense in the context of the initial Three Laws. Nobody ever died arguing about that stuff. The Constitution does not guarantee my right to bear Cixin Liu\u2019s The Three-Body Problem . (Actually I guess it does, but you get what I mean\u2014it doesn\u2019t guarantee my right to brain you with it. That thing is a brick.) I don\u2019t mean to make light of guns, the people who insist on their right to bear them, and the deaths of so many\u2014in Las Vegas and elsewhere. But I do think that the fundamental nerdiness of gun owners may be one of the things bollixing the argument. The gun question in this country embodies some fundamental tensions. The Constitution enshrines a right to keep and bear them\u2014a right increasingly honored in its most extreme form after the National Rifle Association went hard in that direction in the 1980s . Yet it\u2019s also true that guns kill way too many people. Americans of good conscience could probably agree that we should find a way to fix the latter without breaking the former. But that\u2019s where the nerdcloud obscures things\u2014it further silos people into expert and nonexpert categories. Nerding out makes it as hard for a non\u2013gun fan to talk to gun owners as for a non-Trekkie to talk about dilithium. This is in part by design. NRA lobbying induced Congress to ban the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from letting public health experts loose on the problem. Last month, the National Institutes of Health abandoned an $18 million program to study gun violence that President Obama instituted after the killings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The facts on the table\u2014who owns guns, what kinds of injuries they cause, who\u2019s most likely to be dangerous versus responsible\u2014disappeared. Absent that information, the NRA\u2019s lobbying becomes that much more potent. You can\u2019t regulate something you don\u2019t understand. Which is exactly what the NRA wants. How else to explain the lack of movement on gun control laws in a country where 90 percent of people support, for example, background checks for all gun purchases? Most Americans don\u2019t own a gun. Most support more stringent regulation. But to get there, they have to climb through an Overton window , a shifting of what people think is politically achievable that in turn constrains conversations about an issue. The conversation has been reframed to be about persnickety details over what constitutes a dangerous, person-killing gun versus one with a somehow nonlethal use. To be clear: I am not saying that ignorance is acceptable when it comes to talking about guns and the laws that govern them. As in all matters of policy\u2014health care, taxes, defense\u2014knowledge and an understanding of history make the difference between good rules and bad. But policymaking progressives fall for Overton window shifts all the time, because at first they seem like a rational argument. The progressives ask for some vast societal shift, and its opponents say no\u2014and spin up a rhetorical whirling blade to administer the thousand cuts necessary to explain why whatever that shift is can never work. Meanwhile the progressives figure if they can just put a Band-Aid on every one of those cuts, they\u2019re making progress. They\u2019re bargaining, you see. But pretty soon all the concessions aggregate into a shifting of the Overton window. Instead of talking about how the government can work with insurers to give everyone health care, we\u2019re talking about Medicare block grants. Instead of figuring out how to reduce gun deaths, we\u2019re finding regulatory definitions for \u201cassault rifle.\u201d \u2014\u2014\u2014- That\u2019s too bad. I think gun nerds might actually be the most receptive audience for real, useful research, because guns are fundamentally gadgets, the quintessential example of the American fixation that Reyner Banham in 1965 called \u201cthe great gizmo.\" It is, he wrote, \u201ca small self-contained unit of high performance in relation to its size and cost, whose function is to transform some undifferentiated set of circumstances to a condition nearer human desires.\u201d Not unlike cars and iPhones, guns are almost immeasurably powerful distillations of human engineering and ingenuity. So someone has to figure out a way to talk about guns that appeals to the people who know the most about them. Here\u2019s my pitch: Cut through NRA lobbying and gun industry profit-mongering by inducing the people who want to nerd out about firearms to nerd even harder .

Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images After the Trump administration's announcement mandating government-wide training sessions on \"the importance of protecting classified and controlled unclassified information\" leaked just under a month ago, the courses themselves have started making their way around to various federal agencies. And according to an inter-department announcement leaked to WIRED, the Department of Energy (DOE) is now the latest agency to undergo the one-hour course. Employees at both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services have already held the anti-leak classes. In the case of HHS, at least part of the video used in the training session was made publicly available on the department's YouTube account. These agency-specific courses exist entirely to comply with national security adviser H.R. McMaster's September 8 memo, which was first reported by BuzzFeed News . In the message that went out to \"virtually every senior official in the federal government,\" according to BuzzFeed, McMaster asserted that leaking both classified and controlled unclassified information \"causes harm to our Nation and shakes the confidence of the American people.\" This mirrored what attorney general Jeff Sessions said during his own anti-leak press conference back in August, when he condemned \"in the strongest terms the staggering number of leaks undermining the ability of our government to protect this country.\" McMaster's original email announcing the government-wide program asked that federal departments and agencies conduct their training the week of September 18 \"to ensure a consistent and strong message is given to the entire federal workforce.\" The Department of Energy seems to be running a bit behind schedule, though. According to the email sent to DOE employees and contractors, staffers will have from October 4 to October 6 to complete the lesson, which has been posted on the DOE website's Online Learning Center. The one-hour course appears to consist largely of a video that DOE Secretary Rick Perry put in the hands of his deputy, Dan Brouillette. The video itself, according to the announcement, exists \"to strengthen our internal behavior as it pertains to protecting classified and sensitive information. This video also includes a message from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, reminding us all of our responsibilities to protect and the penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of classified and sensitive information.\" This DOE announcement appears to carry on what's fast becoming a Trump administration tradition of conflating leaks of classified information with more routine, perfectly legal disclosures. The first sentence of the announcement alone puts equal emphasis on protecting both \"classified and controlled unclassified information.\" According to one DOE official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, the Trump administration's campaign to track down and punish any leaker, regardless of the legality of the act, is more likely to encourage leaks than it is to stop them. \"In any defense or national security role, the guarding of classified or otherwise marked information is held sacred by all those who handle it except a small few who willingly ignore their obligations and open this country up to grave danger and risk,\" said the official. \"By and large, the Trump administration is not talking about these types of documents and information, though, referring rather to the details of meetings and conversations amongst staff or decisions therein which are often in no way classified. ... When we try to institute unnecessary fear of leaking with mandatory trainings, arbitrary limited areas, and an inherent distrust of the civil servants who sign up to serve regardless of political affiliation, it only breeds more distrust of leadership and could foster exactly the culture it was supposedly designed to prevent.\" We've reached out to the Department of Energy for comment on the leak of its anti-leak training announcement, and will update if and when they respond. You can read the email itself below. Department of Energy National Security Training Video The National Security Advisor, Lt. General H.R. McMaster, requested in his September 8 memorandum that all Federal Government departments and agencies conduct a one-hour event to engage their workforce on the importance of protecting classified and controlled unclassified information. Accordingly, Secretary Perry charged Deputy Secretary Brouillette with highlighting the importance of protecting classified and controlled unclassified information, and spotlight measures to prevent and detect unauthorized disclosures. Deputy Secretary Brouillette directed the Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security with bringing together senior leaders from across the Department with the collective goal of creating a training video to strengthen our internal behavior as it pertains to protecting classified and sensitive information. This video also includes a message from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, reminding us all of our responsibilities to protect and the penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of classified and sensitive information. Audience : This training is mandatory for ALL Federal and contractor employees and details and will be available for viewing on October 4. The Deputy Secretary has directed that all DOE personnel complete this protecting classified and controlled unclassified information training no later than October 6. Programs will need to work through the contracting officer technical representatives for questions about workflow and with contracting officers to ensure program interests with respect to any added costs associated with this training are addressed.

No one wants to think about the technology that lets them move from screen to screen, or which phrases Google Assistant can or can\u2019t understand. People just want it to work. That\u2019s the big theme that extends across everything Google announced today, from the brains behind its new generation of Pixel phones to the newly miniaturized and maximized Google Home devices. With a smart combination of hardware, software, and artificial intelligence, it all just works. Missed all of the announcements? You can catch up with our live coverage of the event , or read all of the highlights right here. Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL \nLooking for 2017\u2019s hottest smartphone? You\u2019ve found it. The Pixel 2 and larger Pixel 2 XL offer the same high-end, bleeding-edge tech as the original Pixel phone. Google added a few features (like waterproofing) and removed a few (adios, headphone jack), but mostly, these are refined, improved versions of last year\u2019s models. If you\u2019re going to get this phone, though, it\u2019s for the camera. This generation of Pixels is built for the AR and VR future, and the camera scores a 98 from DXO Mark, the leading independent camera rating group. That\u2019s the highest rating for a smartphone camera ever. All those features will cost you, though: The Pixel 2 starts at $649; the XL, at $849. Read our story here .

The donut-sized device can do everything the original Google Home can do\u2014set timers and reminders, check the weather, convert tablespoons to cups\u2014but takes up no more space than a candle. The smart speaker, which you can pre-order today, comes in three colors: coral, chalk, and charcoal. Oh, and it\u2019s just $49. Read our story here .

Google Home Max \nGoogle Home isn\u2019t just getting tinier. The company also introduced the Google Home Max, a giant tabletop speaker that tunes automatically to your space. It pumps out sound with more than 20 times more power than Google Home (which is to say: it\u2019s really, really loud). It also comes with Smart Sound, a system that uses Google\u2019s AI to configure sound to your space. And of course, Assistant\u2019s built in, ready to act as your own personal DJ. It\u2019ll be available this December for $399, in chalk or charcoal. Credit: Google \nGoogle Home isn\u2019t just getting tinier.

The 12.3-inch screen rotates a full 360 degrees, and the whole thing weighs just two pounds. In a welcome update, the device supports Google Play, so you can open the same apps on your Pixelbook\u2014even Snapchat\u2014as you can on your smartphone. It\u2019s also the first laptop with Google Assistant baked in. You can summon the Assistant by using its wake word, or press the dedicated Assistant button on the keyboard\u2019s bottom row when you don\u2019t feel like talking to your computer.

That\u2019s the idea behind Google\u2019s new wireless earbuds, which give you a direct line to Google Assistant. Think of the $159 buds as Google\u2019s answer to Apple\u2019s AirPods. You can tap the side to play or pause your music, swipe forward and back to change volume, or long-press to talk to Assistant. They also have Google Translate built-in, with the capability to translate languages in real time\u2014so you can pretend you understand French without knowing a single word, thanks to the helpful AI inside your ears.

For all the rest, Google introduced a different kind of camera called Google Clips. The palm-sized device takes photos for you, using AI to find the candid moments you might want to capture\u2014like that shot of your dog balancing a treat on his nose, or your toddler taking her first steps. Capture those moments as stills, videos, or GIFs, then export them to your phone over Wi-Fi.

Daydream View \nWhen Google introduced its Daydream View VR headset last year, it only worked with the Pixel and you could use it to launch only 25 apps. Now, with a second-generation headset, Google\u2019s setting its sights a little wider. The new hardware comes with a wider field of view and a better overall viewing experience, and the face mask that feels more secure. (Also, you can now buy it in coral!) There\u2019s new content coming to Daydream, too, including a new original YouTube series in VR, adding to the 250 VR titles Google already offers. You can pre-order it now, starting at $99.

Augmented Reality \nGoogle\u2019s been inching closer and closer to the augmented reality future\u2014especially after announcing AR Core , its AR software development kit, earlier this year. Those high-end cameras on the new Pixel phones? Those were built specifically to handle augmented reality. Google showed off some of that future today with a collection of AR stickers that will be available on the Pixel, which let you bring characters from shows like Stranger Things to life right before your eyes. OK, so it\u2019s not a mind-blowing use of augmented reality. But the Upside Down looks a lot freakier when it\u2019s right there in your living room.

JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images For the moment, it looks like the American people won\u2019t be able to see Russian-linked social-media ads that were used to influence the 2016 election. During a press conference on Wednesday, Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, said it is important that that the American public sees the ads submitted to the Senate intelligence committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. But Warner and committee Chair Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, say the panel will not release the ads\u2014or any documents provided by witnesses or companies. Burr said the companies are free to release the ads themselves. But Facebook, Twitter, and Google do not seem likely to offer that level of transparency. Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment from WIRED, but Business Insider reported that a person close to Facebook said that company will not release any of the more than 3,000 ads it has linked to Russian entities and turned over to Congress. A statement from a Twitter spokesperson did not address whether ads the company turned over to Congress would be made public. In advance of the hearing, Facebook placed a full-page ad in several prominent newspapers highlighting nine actions the company says it is taking to protect users from election interference, including hiring more people to review ads and allowing users to see all the ads placed by any group. But the newspaper ad was silent on whether Facebook will release the Russia-linked ads from 2015 and 2016. Facebook, Twitter, and Google have been invited to testify at a committee hearing on Nov. 1, and all are expected to do so.

Eventually, you make it to the office, and plop down in front of your Pixelbook. \"Keep playing Discover Weekly,\" you type into your laptop, and the tunes pick up on your laptop where your phone left off in the car. You spend the next few hours toting your Pixelbook to meetings, flipping the screen around to doodle on mock-ups and show everyone the latest analytics. All the while, you're pressing on the earbud in your right ear, dictating messages and reminders to Google Assistant. People look at you suspiciously, but screw them. Late in the day, a notification pops up on your Pixelbook: Don't forget the orange slices! \"Hey Google, navigate to Safeway,\" you whisper to your phone as you walk out the door. That, more or less, is Google's vision for the future of hardware. The company announced a series of new devices at an event in San Francisco on Wednesday, broadening and improving its gadget lineup. Many exist for the same purpose: to bring Google Assistant everywhere, so you'll use it instead of Alexa or Siri or Cortana or whatever else joins the market. Taken together, these devices offer the clearest vision yet of what you might call The Unified Theory of Google Hardware, which goes something like this: In the future, you'll own and use lots of gadgets. Every single one should have access to the same data, the same settings, the same assistant, the same deep knowledge of you and your life. They all do the same stuff. All that changes is the screen. Google Take the Pixelbook . On one hand, it's a laptop: keyboard, trackpad, 12.3-inch screen. But it runs Android apps, has a touchscreen, supports pen input, and flips 360 degrees so you can hide the aforementioned keyboard and trackpad. So it's a tablet. But! It can automatically connect to LTE through your phone, looks just like a Pixel, and runs Google Assistant and Snapchat and Instagram. So it's\u2026 a phone? Google's overarching message seems to be that all those categories are just words. \"We don't think you should have a device for this, and a device for that,\" Matt Vokoun, a product manager for Google, told me after the event. \"If you're not on Chrome OS with Android apps, you kind of live in a world where there's things I can do on my laptop, and then I have to switch to my phone to do other things.\" Eventually, Google imagines a world where you switch gadgets because sometimes you want a pocket-sized, handheld device, and other times you want something with a keyboard and trackpad. But you should never have to switch because some app or feature doesn't work. This ethos applies even to the new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL . \"Feel free to choose whichever size Pixel you prefer,\" Google's Mario Queiroz said on stage, \"because you'll get the same great experience on both. We don't set aside features for the larger device.\" He got big applause for that last line, a clear dig at the Apple's big-phone-only features like Portrait Mode. Largely because it can do so much with software, Google's able to bring its very best features to all the hardware it makes. Don't be surprised when your Pixelbook webcam becomes an AR machine. In many ways, Google's actually executing on an old idea about how tech should work. In 1999, Mark Weiser, the chief scientist at the famed Xerox Parc research lab, wrote a paper called \"The Computer for the 21st Century.\" In it, he outlined a world in which technology became mostly invisible, electronics and computers running for our benefit but without our constant attention. He also imagined a different kind of gadget. \"Ubiquitous computers will also come in different sizes, each suited to a particular task,\" Weiser wrote. \"My colleagues and I have built what we call tabs, pads and boards: inch-scale machines that approximate active Post-It notes, foot-scale ones that behave something like a sheet of paper (or a book or a magazine), and yard-scale displays that are the equivalent of a blackboard or bulletin board.\" These things would adapt and interact, allowing people to use any device they could find any way they wanted. Some things worked better on small screens; others on large ones. But anything was possible. \"We don't think you should have a device for this, and a device for that.\" \u2014 Matt Vokoun, product manager for Google The idea's on the mind of many people in tech. \"I do think we have too many screens in our lives,\" Gadi Amit, the founder of design firm New Deal Design, told me earlier this year. \"And the screens are not unified enough, and not clear enough.\" He's betting eventually we'll all have three: a big, home-theater-sized screen, something about the size of a phone or tablet, and a small screen for all your short interactions. Software runs near-identically across all of them, because with Alexa or Google Assistant, the screen becomes less important anyway. But when you want to watch a movie, you pick the big screen. When you're writing a long email, you pick the middle one. When you're just checking the weather, you choose the small one that's always with you. There are already glimmers of this all over the industry. Amazon makes every shape and size of Alexa gadget because even though it's always Alexa inside, an Echo Spot fits where a Plus might not. Even though the Apple Watch can do so many of the same things as iPhone, the shape and size of the thing change the way you use it. Same with the iPad and a MacBook. But while Apple believes firmly that different devices need different apps, different operating systems, and different interface models, Google's trying to strip out as much difference as possible between devices. The Android apps on your phone look just like the ones on your laptop, and for better or worse (some Android apps are rough on the big screen) that's how Google wants it. Some things don't require a screen at all, which is where Google Home comes in. As Google Assistant and its competitors continue to stake their place at the heart of your computing life, they'll be the same no matter where you go or what device you use. More than anything, they'll be the computers. All that changes is the size of the window you see them through.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T02:04:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "838f30260457383772546af82921bf7a0d6746ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjIDkAGY.Jp7SY89oIarVmPsrUpzj_rjAiPtcTa7CDtdGLpyc84_GAj39UrV_L_teXhAzIaWETM5Az3U4KydllXFAlommuXE8ujfYM7ms_.A--", "site_full": "www.wired.com", "site": "wired.com", "site_section": "http://wired.com/rss/index.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Wired", "title": "That Flag-Burning Seattle Seahawks Photo Isn\u2019t Fake News.

For one, the pixelated flames look like Bennett actually is burning his left leg off. His right hand appears weirdly small and misshapen. There's no smoke; the fire sprinklers aren't going off. Sure, people quickly scrolling through Facebook might not notice this stuff and think it's real\u2014but even when other commenters pointed out the obvious fallacies, others insisted the photo was still fundamentally true. \u201cFake or not, when they take the knee it\u2019s the same difference,\u201d one man said. So, what makes this clearly 'shopped photo so powerful? Simple. It's a meme in disguise. Memes cannibalize existing source material everyone knows in order to tap into ideas or sentiments people connect with. Someone takes a photo, GIF, or drawing and alters it with words, Photoshop, or other images to send a message. That message resonates with other people, who spread it around and adapt it. Often it's a joke; the Leonardo DiCaprio cheerily strolling through bizarre situations, say, or Kermit the frog giving into his darkest desires via a hooded version of himself. Other times, it's more political, like the photo of New Jersey governor Chris Christie man-spreading on a beach he closed to the public over 4th of July weekend. Instantly, people began Photoshopping Christie into all sorts of off-limits scenarios, from the Abraham Lincoln's lap to the Enterprise's control room. \"They tap into high-arousal emotions, like disgust or anger. That helps them spread,\" says Benjamin Lyons, communications expert and postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Politics at the University of Exeter. \"And because by nature they\u2019re so reductionist and binary, they tend to draw in those types of reactions.\" It's impossible to know the intentions behind the Bennett photo, but it's built exactly like a meme. The creator appropriated an obscure photo of a post-game victory dance\u2014taken by Seahawks photographer Rod Mar nearly two years ago\u2014and altered it. But the manipulation didn't suss out a meaning that was already there; it created it. Michael Bennett sitting during the national anthem, the photo is saying, is equivalent to Michael Bennett burning the American flag. The event never happened, but that doesn't matter. The inside implication is still true. \u201cThat resonance ended up being truer to them than the actual facts of the case,\u201d says Ryan Milner, a meme expert at the College of Charleston. \u201cThey shared it because it was a representation of what they think about NFL players. So when the facts go against that, they can just go back to what originally resonated.\u201d This hybrid of fake news meme isn't necessarily new\u2014a digitally altered photo of a shark swimming down a flooded city street gets passed around every hurricane season. But its power is only becoming more sinister as it gets harder to know what\u2019s real. At best, people may get tired puzzling out the truth. At worse, they might stop worrying about it altogether. \u201cIn that way, it\u2019s an exemplar of a new normal,\u201d Milner says. The problem is no longer just fake photos. It\u2019s the fact people don\u2019t care they're not real. Related Video Technology Here\u2019s How Fake News Works (and How the Internet Can Stop It) Many fake news peddlers didn\u2019t care if Trump won or lost the election.

First it suffered the public reveal of a long-awaited report that appeared to confirm Uber knew its former superstar engineer, Anthony Levandowski, took intellectual property from Google, his former employer, before it hired him. Then, over Uber\u2019s protest, the judge pushed the trial date back from this month to December, giving Waymo more time to prepare its case. (Uber wanted the gavel to drop ASAP.) To quickly sum up the case: Waymo alleges that when former star engineer Levandowski left the company in January 2016, he made off with thousands of documents containing its proprietary information, then used that intellectual property to jumpstart his own company, Otto. Uber acquired Otto for a reported $680 million in August 2016, and Waymo says Levandowski brought this stolen info with him\u2014and that its intellectual property ended up in Uber's self-driving cars. Waymo does not have this case squared away just yet. The judge in charge of the case thinks that for all their efforts and revelations, even after spending nearly 4,500 hours reviewing thousands of documents, Waymo's lawyers have not convincingly linked Levandowski's alleged wrongdoing to anything that happened in Uber's workshops. \u201cIf there\u2019s a smoking gun, let me see it right now,\u201d Judge William Alsup told Waymo lawyers on Tuesday. This is all despite the juicy revelations of a hotly contested report released by the court on Monday evening, one many expected to break the case open for Waymo. In a standard due diligence move, Uber commissioned the firm Stroz Friedburg to compile the 34-page investigation into Levandowski and Otto before acquiring the company and putting the engineer in charge of its self-driving efforts. Uber tried for months to shield this report from the public view, and it's easy to see why. It shows that Levandowski and Uber execs had informal chats at least six months before the engineer left Waymo, and that Levandowski had possession of Waymo documents at least two months after he departed the company. The report finds that Uber execs, including Kalanick, say they warned him they didn't want any Waymo info, and Levandowski deleted various documents from his personal laptop. He also told Uber's investigators that he destroyed five disks containing Google proprietary information before meeting with them. According to the report, the investigators were unable to verify his account. (Levandowski has asserted his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination, and refused to cooperate with Uber\u2019s lawyers. Uber fired him in May.) This might look like suspicious behavior, sure, but it\u2019s not proof of Waymo's chief accusation: that Uber acquired Otto and hired Levandowski so it could use its know-how to advance its own nascent self-driving program. At least not in Alsup's opinion. \"This is not the home run they were expecting,\" the judge said in Tuesday's hearing. And he indicated he's less interested in what happened before the Otto acquisition than in how, exactly, Waymo trade secrets might have made it into Uber tech after Levandowski became an employee. Out of the Park But you don't always need a home run to win a ball game. It's possible Waymo will never find such killer evidence, and that such evidence doesn't exist. That might be OK. \u201cTrade secret misappropriation is not just, \u2018You absolutely knew about the theft and I have to prove your consciousness of guilt,\u2019 \u201d says John Marsh, an attorney with the law firm Bailey Cavalieri, who focuses on trade secrets. \u201cNegligence can be enough.\u201d Even if Uber told Levandowski to keep Waymo intellectual property far away from its operation, it could be found responsible for that sort of negligence. As Alsup wrote in a May order, \u201cEven if Levandowski so agreed, his word under these circumstances would be cold comfort against the danger of trade secret misappropriation for Uber\u2019s benefit.\u201d In other words, maybe Uber didn't do enough to make sure it wouldn't benefit from stolen knowledge. Carelessness with intellectual property, even if it's not premeditated theft, can be enough to win a trade secrets case, Marsh says. Proving such negligence is difficult, and might win Waymo less money in the end, Marsh says, but it's not the only way forward. Waymo could try to prove that its info helped Uber develop its self-driving cars, even if the final product looks nothing like Waymo\u2019s. \u201cIn the research and development community, knowing what path not to follow is as valuable as knowing what path to follow,\u201d says Marsh. Waymo could argue not that Levandowski took a specific piece of Uber tech, but that he used the information to create shortcuts through Uber\u2019s development phase. The jargonistas call this a \"negative trade secret\". After all, Waymo had a seven-year jump when Uber founded its self-driving car unit in 2015. The Alphabet company spent years developing its own version of the sensors that sit in the middle of this case: the lidar that Waymo alleges Uber stole. That's not unusual. \u201cWe joked that we had to find 2,000 ways to not build a lidar before finding this one way that worked really really well,\u201d Austin Russell, CEO and founder of lidar company Luminar , told WIRED this summer. \u201cThe physics hasn't changed for why they work or don't work. It's the same thing when we started five years ago.\u201d Making a robust, capable system takes trial and error, and lots of it. Waymo could argue Uber used stolen intellectual property to skip the 'error' bit. Still, it\u2019s rare to pull off this kind of negative trade secret case. Waymo\u2019s lawyers would have to string together a compelling narrative packed with circumstantial evidence, coincidences too coincidental to be accidental. \u201cThose trade secrets cases are rare because they\u2019re difficult to establish and difficult to prove,\u201d says Marsh. Plus, negative trade secrets are controversial in the legal world. \"By opening the market of negative information to all, all previous failures would not be replicated and all Sisyphus-type undertakings would be evaded,\" the Tel Aviv University law professor Amir Khoury wrote in a 2013 paper arguing that intellectual property law should take a different approach to negative trade secrets. \"This would ultimately benefit society at large and (especially) entrepreneurs.\" Whatever their tactic of choice, Waymo\u2019s lawyers have two months to marshal more evidence and win over the heart of Judge Alsup. Well, both teams of lawyers have their work cut out for them: Alsup spent Tuesday\u2019s hearing taking both legal teams to task for \u201chalf-truths.\u201d \u201cIt is true that despite the excellent quality of the lawyers here, I cannot trust what they say,\u201d Alsup said.

David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images Two smartphones. Three smart speakers. A gorgeous laptop and stylus. An upgraded virtual reality headset. A pair of wireless earbuds that can translate a conversation in real-time, like a Babel Fish. New as of Wednesday, all adding to Google\u2019s existing stable of Chromecasts and Nest smart home devices. Most of them seem to exist for one simple reason: If you want something done right, do it yourself. That something , in this case, is Google Assistant . The company\u2019s pragmatically named AI helper already lives on Google Home, last year\u2019s Pixels, and lots of other smartphones\u2014 including the iPhone . You\u2019ll even find it in speakers from Sony and others later this year. But Google showed Wednesday that for Assistant to reach its true potential, and to realistically gain an edge over Amazon\u2019s Alexa , Apple\u2019s Siri , and the rest of its smart-assistant competition, it can\u2019t rely on third-party partners, or glorified reference models. It needs an ecosystem. And it\u2019s not interested in waiting for one to materialize. Assisted Living \u201cIt all starts with reimagining hardware from the inside out,\u201d said Google hardware guru Rick Osterloh from the stage Wednesday, establishing the event\u2019s theme. The \u201cinside,\u201d in this case, isn\u2019t a processor or a subwoofer. It\u2019s Assistant, the beating heart of each of Google\u2019s new products. Google Home Mini and Max , the minor and major key stereos, make for the easiest example, since \u201cOK, Google\u201d drives every interaction with them. While the Chromebook Pixel line that preceded the Pixelbook existed to promote Chrome OS exclusively, Google's rebranded laptop features a dedicated Google Assistant button . Google also credited Assistant as the primary reason it bothered creating a stylus at all. \u201cWhen you\u2019re using your Pixelbook as a tablet, it\u2019s easiest to show your Assistant what you need help with on your screen,\u201d said Google\u2019s Matt Vokoun on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s why we created the new Pixelbook Pen.\u201d Rather than leading off by showing its new stylus writing, Google\u2019s first Pen demo was as an Assistant assistant, circling a musician to summon up information based on the selected image alone. The Pixel Buds wireless earbuds don\u2019t have Assistant directly on board, but pair them with your smartphone and Assistant pops up with one tap. If you talk with someone who speaks a different language, you can use Pixel Buds to translate both ends of your conversation in real-time. It works in 40 languages. This is Star Trek territory. Then there are the phones , the original and most obvious Assistant vessels, which means we can gloss over them a bit. Except to note that when you squeeze the sides of the iPhone in iOS 11\u2014or more specifically, the power button and a volume button simultaneously\u2014it enters SOS mode, enabling fast access to emergency responders. When you squeeze the sides of a Pixel, it calls up Assistant. These are all experiences that Google has created whole-cloth. It isn\u2019t just putting Assistant in more premium devices, it\u2019s ensuring that Assistant can do more interesting things. Which also means that on the precipice of the next major platform fight, Google\u2019s taking a starkly different approach than it did with Android. Flying Solo For years, Google\u2019s hands-off approach with Android presented both a blessing and curse. Massive gains in volume came with inconsistent quality, as hardware partners squeezed the operating system into unforgiving sizes and weighed it down with unwelcome bloat. All the while, Apple refined iOS and the iPhone in lockstep, enabling Cupertino to release its Platonic smartphone ideal each year. \u201cI think they really learned that lesson early on when they got hammered every day and every minute by Apple,\u201d says Michael Facemire, an analyst with Forrester Research. \u201cIt worked for Google because if you look at worldwide distribution of mobile devices, Android is on the majority of them. But it\u2019s not on the ones where people are spending money.\u201d Creating what it thinks are best-in-class Assistant experiences helps show Google\u2019s partners how to do it right. It also, though, hedges against the probability that partners will be harder to come by. Android succeeded because it was the only iOS alternative, a handy shortcut for any hardware manufacturer needing a smartphone plan. (They all did.) That\u2019s demonstrably not so with Assistant. Amazon\u2019s Alexa leveraged its early lead, taking up residence in millions of homes, and sneaking onto iOS through the Amazon app . And it\u2019s already scoring some third-party wins, most notably and most recently with Wednesday\u2019s news that Sonos would put Alexa inside one of its speakers . Sonos has said it will add Google Assistant and Siri too, eventually. But Alexa comes first. And even when Assistant does make it onto Sonos, it\u2019ll be one of three players, just as it is on Ikea\u2019s smart bulbs . Google found smartphone ubiquity because it was the default. To win the assistant game, it\u2019s going to have to be the best. That\u2019s especially true given that Google\u2019s most reliable smartphone partner, Samsung, not only made a Google Assistant of its own, but gave it a dedicated hardware button on its flagship Galaxy S8 . Google may be able to put Assistant on every Android phone, but it can\u2019t guarantee top billing. The Next Frontier If anything, Google\u2019s hardware push shows just how vital Assistant\u2019s success will be to the company going forward. Google didn\u2019t show off gadgets Wednesday; it detailed the pedestals on which it can best display its AI.

The twin propeller blades whirl, but the beast isn't going anywhere. It's bolted down, attached to load sensors that measure and quantify its attempt to escape. Even without takeoff, the movement of those propellers marks a milestone for a new kind of aircraft, the technological successor to the famed V-22 Osprey and a leading candidate to replace the US Army's aging workhorse, the Black Hawk helicopter. On that concrete ramp, the V-280 Valor tiltrotor started its engines for its first ground tests, with engineers monitoring every possible parameter to be sure each system in this one-of-a-kind prototype is working properly. When fully operational, the V-280 Valor should offer double the speed and range of the conventional helicopters it's aiming to make redundant. \"Wow, it\u2019s a real aircraft,\u201d I blurt out as I pass through a small door, into the towering, brightly lit, V-280 assembly hangar at Bell Helicopter in Amarillo, Texas. The look of a tilt-rotor aircraft is so alien, it\u2019s easy to forget this isn\u2019t something dreamt up by the Battlestar Galactica prop department. \u201cIt is a real aircraft,\u201d agrees Shannon Massey, Bell\u2019s VP of assembly operations, with a smile. It\u2019s a reaction she\u2019s used to. The V-280 is truly something different. It's smaller, simpler, and cheaper than the massively complex V-22, which dates to the late \u201980s. Bell designed and built the V-280 from scratch, always with an eye on making it easy to assemble and maintain, with lessons learned from building the V-22, a joint project with Boeing. As I duck under the wing and walk up to the cockpit, I\u2019m struck by the expanse of glass. The V-280's pilots will get a wrap-around view of the sky\u2014or battlefield\u2014around them. They\u2019ll also have a comfy flight. The flight control avionics come from Lockheed Martin\u2019s C-130K plane setup, with large, flat, screens built into the dash. With the speed and range that Bell is claiming for this thing, pilot fatigue could become an issue, so designers replaced a conventional central cyclic control (the stick between a helicopter pilot's legs) with a joystick that falls under the pilot's right hand. Bell Helicopter As a tiltrotor, the V-280 is a hybrid between a plane and a helicopter. Instead of one central rotor, it has two, mounted at the end of two stubby wings. For takeoff and landing, the blades are parallel to the ground, so the machine can get airborne without a runway and hover. Once in the air, the rotors swivel forward, the way a plane's propellers sit, to allow high speed forward flight. The V-22 may have proven the concept, but also showed how complicated and expensive a transforming machine can be. Bell simplified the V-280 with a setup that swings the propellers but keeps the engines stationary. That takes out a bunch of moving parts, avoids scorching the ground during takeoff and landing, and allows for a side-loading door, which the Army likes. Back a few yards from the prototype, beyond the yellow rope, sits a row of tall metal workstations. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone old-school in some ways and pulled people out of offices,\u201d says Jeff Josselyn, manager of the V-280 build team. He says it makes communication easier, and keeps everyone focused on the goal. \u201cI don\u2019t care what kind of day you\u2019re having, when you look up and see that beautiful aircraft, it just makes you want to keep leaning into the wind.\u201d These ground tests are a long-awaited achievement for Josselyn and his team. They started engineering work on the aircraft in 2012, and began building the thing in June 2015. But true success will take yet more work. There's more testing, yes, but the main trick will be convincing the US Army to actually buy the thing. Bell built the V-280 to compete for the Pentagon\u2019s joint multirole technology demonstrator program. It faces competition from Boeing and Sikorsky, which are jointly building the SB-1 Defiant, a high speed helicopter. Observers like Bell's chances. \u201cThis could be a great leap forward for Army aviation,\u201d says Jerry Kidrick, a retired Army colonel who flew helicopters in Iraq and now teaches aviation and flight training at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. One day, tiltrotors could filter down to civilian transport, eliminating runways. The technological and materials advances that made this aircraft possible could also benefit the designers of flying cars, which promise similar vertical takeoff abilities. Bell is confident that the advantages of a new type of flying machine outweigh the risks. The next step in proving its point should come by the end of the year, when Bell unhooks the V-280 for the first flight.

Gifford is the VP of Communications for Whole Woman\u2019s Health, which operates five reproductive healthcare clinics across Texas. This wasn\u2019t her first time testifying before the state legislature, but it was her first time testifying about abortion. \u201cI entered into this with eyes wide open, and knowing that I was more than likely going to be devoured up in there,\u201d she says. Given her job, Gifford is no stranger to high-pressure environments, but she was unprepared for what came next. She slowly walked to the podium, introduced herself, and read her testimony against House Bill 2, a sweeping piece of legislation that laid out some of the harshest abortion restrictions in the country. When she finished, a committee member laid into her. He denounced her for marketing and promoting abortion, and criticized the organization\u2019s website for its professional appearance because it helped \u201csell\u201d abortions. He also read the organization\u2019s URL\u2014 www.wholewomanshealth.com \u2014out loud. \u201cIt was like he mockingly invited people to go to our site and mess with us and made sure our web address made it into public record,\u201d says Amy Hagstrom Miller, the founder and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health. Which is precisely what happened. Later that day, Whole Woman\u2019s Health noticed a surge in hacking attempts through routine monitoring of web activity. A few days after, the staff couldn\u2019t log into the website. One of the intrusive efforts had succeeded, and shut the website down for a week. It was just the beginning of the onslaught of cyberattacks that Whole Woman\u2019s Health would experience between June 2013 and April 2016, as the organization continued to fight a legal battle over abortion that went all the way to the Supreme Court. The battle lines around abortion in the US have been clearly drawn for decades. Protesters, ranging from handfuls to hundreds, stake territory outside clinics to pray, wave signs, and yell into loudspeakers. On the legislative front, politicians have enacted hundreds of Targeted Restrictions of Abortion Providers laws since 2010 that make it difficult for women to access abortion care, and cause clinics to close down. Over the past few years, though, a new front has emerged that many reproductive healthcare organizations struggle to deal with. Cyberattacks and threats, as well as internet harassment, have escalated, aiming to disrupt services, intimidate providers and patients, and prevent women from getting the care they need. After the initial attack, Whole Woman\u2019s Health hired a cybersecurity specialist to remove the malware and repair the damage that had been done. Still, Hagstrom Miller says, the site suffered more than 500 hacking attempts each day in the wake of Gifford\u2019s testimony. About a month later, hackers found and exploited a vulnerability in the Whole Woman\u2019s Health blog, which gave them a backdoor to the entire website. The second successful attack shut down the site for a month. Without it, potential patients were unable to find the clinics, make appointments, identify hours, locations, and services provided, and ask questions. \u201cThe damage was awful,\u201d Gifford said. \u201cOur phones literally stopped ringing. It was devastating. Most of our patients find us online, so with no website and no Google advertising, it made day-to-day awareness nearly impossible.\u201d After that attack, Whole Woman\u2019s Health switched to a more secure hosting provider, and rebuilt every single page on its website, around 100 in all. These measures allowed the organization to better track the cyberthreats as they came in, but didn\u2019t stop them. As Whole Woman\u2019s Health continued to speak out in support of abortion rights, hackers continued to strike. 'The damage was awful. Our phones literally stopped ringing. It was devastating.' \u2014 Amy Hagstrom Miller, Whole Women's Health On April 2, 2014, the Center for Reproductive Rights filed a lawsuit on behalf of five Texas clinics challenging HB2, and Whole Woman\u2019s Health became the lead plaintiff. The case wound its way through the lower courts until the Supreme Court issued its decision in 2016. Throughout this multi-year process, Hagstrom Miller emerged as an outspoken advocate for reproductive rights. Every time she went on MSNBC or CNN to talk about the case, Whole Woman\u2019s Health experienced a surge in hacking attempts. In one subsequent attack, hackers rerouted visitors to Whole Woman\u2019s Health website to a pornographic page. \u201cIt was not only not a landing page, but it took you somewhere awful,\u201d Hagstrom Miller said. \u201cI remember being mortified.\u201d The high-profile of Whole Woman\u2019s Health may have made the organization a unique target, but anti-abortion cyber warfare is part of a larger trend. While hate speech and online harassment have long plagued abortion providers\u2014including over 42,500 incidents of hate speech in 2016 alone, according to the National Abortion Federation\u2014actual hacking represents a serious escalation. Even organizations like Planned Parenthood, which have significant resources and manpower, struggle to prevent attacks from a loosely organized but determined group of \u201chacktivists\u201d and extremists. In July 2015, Planned Parenthood\u2019s website was hacked shortly after the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion group, released secretly recorded (and discredited) videos doctored to make it seem like Planned Parenthood sold fetal tissue. The same attack also targeted the National Network of Abortion Funds and the Abortion Care Network. As reported by the Daily Dot , a group called 3301 claimed credit for the hack, and said they used a Blind SQL injection, in which an attacker queries a database in hopes that the response will reveal information or vulnerabilities. \"Here we are, the social justice warriors, seeking to reclaim some sort of lulz for the years and thousands of dollars that Planned Parenthood have wasted and made harvesting your babies,\" 3301 wrote on its site. The group then published the names and contact information for more than 300 Planned Parenthood employees online. These types of leaks can create real-world danger. Abortion providers have a long history of being stalked, assaulted, harassed, and murdered . In communities that are hostile to abortion, it\u2019s not uncommon for staff to hide what they do, drive different routes to work, and take great pains to hide their identity. Doxxing can put their lives at risk. David Cohen, a professor of law at Drexel University and the author of Living in the Crosshairs: The Untold Stories of Anti-Abortion Terrorism , says extremist anti-abortion groups have used tactics like this since the early days of the internet, but the vulnerability landscape has broadened and diversified. Now, for example, the risk of data breaches (which enable doxxing) is greater. According to the 2016 National Clinic Violence Survey , published by the Feminist Majority Foundation, 13.9 percent of clinics reported that information and pictures of doctors were posted on the internet. \u201cThe antis have been using every tool at their disposal to go after abortion providers and clinics for as long as they have been doing this,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cA lot of clinics did not have a website before five or ten years ago, so the antis were not going to hack anything because there was not anything to hack. As technology spreads and becomes more sophisticated, we are seeing attacks from every angle.\u201d Hackers targeted Whole Woman\u2019s Health and Planned Parenthood because they are prominent, nationally recognized organizations that advocate for abortion rights, but the threats can be localized as well. Calla Hales is the administrator of A Preferred Women\u2019s Health Center (APWHC), which operates four abortion clinics in North Carolina and Georgia. The Charlotte location attracts protesters that can number in the hundreds every week, and Hales said they are besieged by hacking attempts as well. APWHC recently experienced a DDoS attack that shut down the company\u2019s internet and phones. Hackers have shut down the website on multiple occasions as well. \u201cIt happens pretty regularly and we have had to spend way too much money to fix it,\u201d Hales says. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m surprised by how tech-savvy they are.\u201d But Craig Petronella, a cybersecurity expert who focuses on the healthcare industry, says that it\u2019s relatively easy these days for any \u201cmotivated group\u201d to wage a cyberattack, whether it\u2019s through malware, ransomware, a phishing scheme, or a DDoS attack. \u201cAnyone that knows how to type a word document or a simple email can go on the dark web with malicious intent to find what they are after,\u201d Petronella says. \u201cThe simplicity of it is scary.\u201d Organizations without strong protections in place face proportionally greater risk. Many hospitals, clinics, and private practices operate on older technology and equipment and have limited resources to devote to state-of-the-art IT. \u201cHealthcare is such low-hanging fruit,\u201d Petronella says. \u201cHackers know their defenses are weak and they are limited on budget, without a lot of sophistication with cybersecurity. They also know that a healthcare practice needs their computer systems and are sensitive to downtime. They can do a lot of damage.\u201d Providing abortion services further adds to a clinic\u2019s lure as a target, and because the attacks happen online, people can participate anonymously and from afar. Hales and Hagstrom Miller may recognize the protesters who show up outside their clinics everyday, but they have no idea where the cyberattacks are coming from. There are also rules in place for dealing with human protesters that don\u2019t carry over to online interference. The FACE Act prohibits people from trespassing on clinic property and blockading entrances, and law enforcement is supposed to intervene when protesters violate those laws. It\u2019s easier to catch someone who breaks in and physically smashes equipment than a hacker who shuts down a system remotely. Cyberattacks are illegal, but notoriously difficult to police. 'As technology spreads and becomes more sophisticated, we are seeing attacks from every angle.' \u2014 David Cohen, Drexel University And then there are the threats that exist in gray area. APWHC does not have Wi-Fi, because they ask their patients to stay off their phones for privacy purposes. Hales said one local anti-abortion group sends over a van that parks outside the clinic with a Wi-Fi node that broadcasts a network called Abortion Info. When patients connect to the network, they are taken to a website that looks like APWHC\u2019s, but isn\u2019t. \u201cPeople automatically log in and the website looks exactly like our website,\u201d Hales says. \u201cIt has all these cartoon videos that say things like \u2018I\u2019m going to stick in the speculum and rip the arm off.\u2019 It\u2019s creepy as shit.\u201d Geotargeting is another example. In 2016, a mobile advertising and marketing firm called Copley Advertising was hired by RealOptions, a network of crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs), and the evangelical adoption agency Bethany Christian Services, to target \u201cabortion-minded\u201d women in Planned Parenthood clinics with anti-choice messages. Beyond the nuisance factor, the action raises legitimate concerns about anti-choice groups gaining access to personal information about patients, and sending them unwanted messages. Massachusetts recently banned this practice , but it demonstrates how the anti-abortion movement has embraced digital tools can to circumvent barriers they face in the physical world. They may not be allowed to walk into a clinic and hand out pamphlets, but they can distribute the same information to the same women in the same place, via their phones. Hacks and other digital intrusions now make up part of the anti-abortion landscape. The structure of the attacks may differ from their real-world counterparts, but the goals are the same, and the threats they pose to providers\u2019 capacity to do their jobs and deliver care are just as real\u2014even if they don\u2019t happen on the ground. Prevention, however, can be tough. Clinics and organizations often don\u2019t take steps to boost their cybersecurity until after an attack has hit, but at that point, it\u2019s too late. It took multiple successful hacking attempts for Whole Women\u2019s Health to make the necessary adjustments. \u201cAfter being targeted so incessantly over a short time frame, we knew immediately that we needed to develop and employ an internal system in which we closely monitored the site,\u201d said Gifford. \u201cSo we got an additional layer of website security and on a daily basis, we log in to the website to make sure that all security plug-ins are up to date and that nothing has been compromised.\u201d The attacks against Whole Woman\u2019s Health have since subsided, but who knows when they might strike again? There is no such thing as \u201cperfect\u201d cybersecurity, and with no known hacking-related arrests, clinics are pretty much on their own\u2014forced to funnel resources that could go to STI testing, contraceptives, subsidized care, and yes, abortion access into fighting faceless, nameless, enemies whose health and wellbeing are not on the line.

For example, the new Google Home speakers can be configured to recognize different people from the sounds of their voices. Say \u201cHey Google, call mom,\u201d and the device knows to use your contacts to phone your mother, not your mother-in-law. Amazon\u2019s Alexa also can\u2019t do that yet. Apple\u2019s first home speaker, the HomePod , doesn\u2019t arrive until December\u2014tens of millions of units behind Google and Amazon\u2019s speakers, by analysts\u2019 estimates. HomePod includes Siri, but Apple CEO Tim Cook has positioned it more as a successor to the iPod, an attempt to \u201creinvent home music,\u201d than the multifunctional home helpers it most resembles. Google and particularly Amazon also have done more than Apple to enable outsiders to work with their assistants\u2014borrowing a strategy the Cupertino company pioneered with the iPhone\u2019s app store. Outside developers have built more than 25,000 \u201cskills\u201d for Alexa, and the assistant is being integrated into dozens of cars, televisions, and home appliances. Google Assistant is being built into products from companies including Sony . On Wednesday the search company announced tools to encourage developers to create Google Home apps and games for families. Apple restricts developers who want to build on top of Siri to just nine use cases . Apple may be saving some Siri upgrades for the HomePod\u2019s launch next month. The company typically waits until new features or technology are fully polished, in contrast to Google\u2019s approach of launching beta services and iterating in public. Apple has made some recent improvements to Siri. At a June event, the service got a new, more realistic voice , and translation capabilities. But on Wednesday, Google upgraded its own assistant\u2019s voice, and showed off a flashier live translation service using its new Pixel Buds wireless earphones . When a female Google executive spoke in Swedish to a male colleague, he heard her words in English; when he replied in English, his words were rendered back into Swedish. The Amazon and Google assistants also now work with images, in addition to voice or text commands. Amazon this year introduced an Alexa-powered device called the Echo Look , with a camera that can offer feedback on your outfit, like a 21st century magic mirror. Google, which has invested heavily in image recognition research for many years, is going further. On the new Pixelbook laptop shown off Wednesday, you can use a stylus to ask Google Assistant to look at images or text. In a demo, circling a musician\u2019s face on a webpage allowed the assistant to identify him and provide links to songs and video. On the Pixel phones, a new feature called Lens lets the assistant access photos taken with the device\u2019s camera. If you snap a notice or document with an email address or phone number, you can tap to call or compose a message, for example. The Lens feature can also summon information about artworks, landmarks, movies or books. As anyone who has used them knows, all virtual assistants are still far from perfect. Many features of the way we use language still elude machines. Creating software capable of keeping track of conversations with back-and-forth responses is still a major research challenge, says William Wang, a professor at the University of California Santa Barbara. Another is giving the systems a broader understanding of things in the world and how they relate to one another, in the form of databases dubbed \u201cknowledge graphs.\u201d Wang and other researchers are trying to figure out how to create those resources automatically, for example from data found online. Google has an advantage on that technology, which it has been developing for years as part of its search engine. An April study by marketer Stone Temple that asked 5,000 general knowledge questions to virtual assistants reported that Google\u2019s got 91 percent correct, compared to Alexa\u2019s 87 percent, and Siri\u2019s 62 percent. Apple\u2019s VP of product marketing Greg Joswiak complained about such comparisons to WIRED last month, saying \u201cwe didn't engineer this thing to be Trivial Pursuit!\" In fact, there\u2019s evidence that Apple is heading in that direction\u2014with good reason. Survey results released by ComScore in May found that answering general questions was the top use case cited by owners of smart speakers (weather and music came second and third). Apple is currently recruiting several engineers and engineering managers to work on \u201cknowledge graphs\u201d for Siri. Another job posted last month asks for candidates who want to help improve Siri\u2019s general knowledge, citing queries such as \u201cWhy are fire trucks red?\u201d and the chance to \u201csettle a few dining room quandaries between families.\u201d For Apple, the most crucial question of all could be: \u201cWhat\u2019s the best personal assistant?\u201d UPDATED, Oct. 6, 5:40pm ET: Amazon says outside developers have built more than 25,000 \"skills\" for its digital assistant Alexa. An earlier version of this article said the total was more than 15,000.

The US Embassy in Havana, Cuba, after the US pulled out more than half of its diplomatic personnel, who suffered health problems due to an alleged sonic attack. Ernesto Mastrascusa/Getty Images The 007-meets-the-X-Files adventures in Cuba continue. Last week the US Department of State recalled non-emergency personnel and families home from the embassy in Havana, citing injuries and illness among 21 people\u2014\u201chearing loss, dizziness, headache, fatigue, cognitive issues, and difficulty sleeping\u201d according to a statement from secretary of state Rex Tillerson. Those 21 people weren\u2019t just cultural attach\u00e9s. Some of the hardest-hit victims were US intelligence operatives, according to an AP story on Monday. Which is to say: Someone in Cuba has been remotely doing something mysterious to US spies\u2019 ears and brains. Call it spook action, at a distance. Most of the reporting on this story so far has talked about some kind of a \u201csonic weapon\u201d or \u201csonic attack,\u201d maybe a side effect of a surveillance technology. The problem is, physicists and acousticians don\u2019t know how ultrasound (high frequency) or infrasound (low frequency) could do what the State Department says happened to its people. That leaves two possibilities: a new sci-fi sound gun or something else. Here\u2019s a hypothesis for the something else: poison. Just to rewind a little bit: The reported injuries vary, from hearing loss (potentially permanent) and dizziness to confusion, headache, and even mild brain trauma . To audiologists and otolaryngologists, that suggests damage or injury in both the inner ear, which converts sound waves into neural impulses and regulates balance, and along neural pathways reaching into the brain. Some of the affected people reported hearing weird noises, sometimes only in specific parts of specific rooms\u2014but others didn\u2019t. It may be that this was a test case, and they wanted to see how useful it was, whoever unleashed it on us. Edward Boyer, Harvard Medical School Immediately that suggests some kind of focused acoustic attack. But nobody will admit to knowing about any technologies that can do all that. \u201cNothing about this story makes any sense to us,\u201d says Robert Putnam, senior marketing director at LRAD, which makes the long-range acoustic device that a cruise ship deployed against pirates in 2005 . But the LRAD uses audible\u2014very, very audible\u2014sound. Most of the Cuban attacks seem to have been inaudible. \u201cIf it\u2019s infrasound, they\u2019re not really hearing it, and you\u2019d have to pump a tremendous amount of energy into the ground,\u201d Putnam says. \u201cIf it\u2019s ultrasound, it attenuates very quickly, and if you pumped a lot of energy into it, it\u2019d heat the skin.\u201d And technologies that focus a beam of audible sound at a single spot don\u2019t have the kind of range our nominal magic sci-fi sound gun would need\u2014as of 2010 \u201cyou had to be within five or 10 feet of the emitter for it to have an effect,\u201d Putnam says. Of course, maybe the magical sci-fi sound gun has made significant technological progress since then. But sound isn\u2019t the only thing that affects hearing and the brain. Chemicals do, too. It\u2019s called ototoxicity \u2014toxicity to the ear\u2014and it\u2019s a known side effect of, for example, some chemotherapeutics and antibiotics. The widely used cancer drug cisplatin can cause hearing loss, as can the category of antibiotics called aminoglycosides, which includes streptomycin and neomycin. Basically, those drugs get into the fluid-filled ductwork of the inner ear and damage the hair cells, which talk to the nerves that lead to the brain. Chemotherapeutics and antibiotics need to be administered intravenously to have an effect, though, so they don\u2019t fit the facts. Heavy metals like lead and mercury can be ototoxic, but they also stay in the blood for a long time; the State Department hasn\u2019t released specific test results for its people\u2014maybe it won\u2019t\u2014but it\u2019s safe to assume they got blood tests. Another class of ototoxins: solvents, like the cleaning product xylene or styrene, used to make glass-reinforced polyesters. Some linger in the blood, but others have a shorter half life. They off-gas from new carpet, paint, and furniture\u2014it\u2019s why some new homes aren\u2019t immediately ready for occupation. \u201cSome of these are going to be obvious. You\u2019re going to smell it,\u201d says Kathleen Campbell, an expert in ototoxicity at Southern Illinois University\u2019s School of Medicine. \u201cBut when we study this, it\u2019s usually through industrial exposure. We\u2019re not looking at the possibility that it could be weaponized and have the aroma taken away.\u201d Finally, though, is an ototoxin that kind of fits the bill. Carbon monoxide causes hearing loss because of its action as an asphyxiant. It kills by displacing oxygen from hemoglobin, the stuff in red blood cells that ferries oxygen around the body. It\u2019s odorless, a gas, and acts centrally\u2014which is to say, it acts on the brain, not just parts of the ear. True, to suffer hearing loss from it, you\u2019d probably have to inhale enough to pass out. But: \u201cIt greatly increases the risk of noise-induced hearing loss. It\u2019s synergistic,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cIf your oxygen levels go down in the ear and then you have noise exposure, you get a great increase in free radicals, and that attacks the hair cells.\u201d Synergistic effects are worth looking at here. Hearing loss doesn\u2019t begin or end at the cochlea, the organ in the ear that mechanically turns sound into nerve impulses. Something that affects the central nervous system\u2014like a solvent or carbon monoxide\u2014could also affect the vestibular system, the trio of fluid-filled, semicircular canals that govern balance. And it could affect other parts of the brain as well. Possibly\u2014though this isn\u2019t well-tested in humans, for good reasons\u2014inaudible infra- and ultrasound could be synergistic with an ototoxin just as industrial factory noise can be . Maybe microwave beams are, too. The thing is, the Cubans have denied any involvement in whatever these attacks are, if indeed they are attacks. In a briefing, a senior State Department official said the investigation is ongoing. US officials have reportedly said they're looking into whether some other country's operatives were responsible. Like maybe even Russia, which has already been involved in attacks on US news media and voting systems. And Russian security services have long employed poison as a weapon, from the 1978 murder of Bulgarian playwright Georgi Markov with a pellet filled with ricin fired from a trick umbrella to the 2006 killing of the spy Alexander Litvinenko with tea laced with polonium-210. The Russians have also used microwaves as a surveillance tool. Soviet intelligence beamed microwaves at the US embassy in Moscow for decades, at least for part of that time to send power to passive microphones embedded in a carved Seal of the United States.

Finally, this past August, we learned the awful news that he had been executed shortly after his transfer. \nSyrian activist Bassel Khartabil, 1981\u20132015 Joi Ito/CC BY Around the time Bassel was first imprisoned, a group of his friends launched an online campaign, #freebassel , to raise awareness of his plight. By putting a name and a face to an issue that is just an abstraction to most of the world, we hoped to underscore that citizens like Bassel are real \u00adpeople with dreams and talents and passions. It felt like what Bassel would have wanted. As the campaign grew, hundreds of us tweeted photos and facts about our friend. We used Facebook to organize synchronous parties for him in cities across the globe. We printed posters of the hashtag and displayed them in public places. We celebrated Bassel by sharing and expanding on the work he did before being detained. His final project, an effort to digitally preserve Syrian archaeology , was kept alive by friends who created and exhibited 3-D-printed replicas of structures that existed in the ancient city of Palmyra\u2014before they were systematically destroyed by ISIS. Admittedly, these efforts sometimes felt fruitless. Could drumming up attention on social media ever amount to anything tangible, especially when the world\u2019s energy was focused elsewhere? We persevered not because we were so naive as to believe our campaign would actually persuade the Assad regime to release Bassel, but because it was the best thing we could think of to do. Ultimately, the story came to the most tragic end possible. But there\u2019s hope that #freebassel will have far-reaching consequences. When Bassel\u2019s execution was finally discovered, the news was covered by the world\u2019s major media networks, and Amnesty International issued a public condemnation . A man who could have been an anonymous casualty instead became an avatar of the fight he so believed in. It also led to the creation of a $50,000 annual fellowship that will support individuals working, as he so bravely did, to promote openness in oppressed regions. While Bassel himself no longer has a voice, there are many in his community who are ready to build upon his work. Bassel used to tell me about Syria\u2019s thriving hip hop scene, and how outsiders were always astonished to hear that anything like it existed. My hope is that the same thing happens with the open culture movement in the Middle East. By turning Bassel into a hero, #freebassel will help other activists receive the funding they need to become leaders in their own right. Our friend\u2019s work will live on through those it inspires and enables\u2014and who will continue to try to bring his dream to the Middle East, and the rest of the world.

Hailey Stewart, one of Frog's industrial designers, had scattered an array of prototypes on a table. On one end, you could see cylinders of foam that looked almost like skinny vibrators, with handles that stuck out at different angles and sketches of levers and screw mechanisms. And on the other, the common speculum\u2014the device used in routine gynecological exams to inspect the cervix. Stewart picked one up and cranked it open. \"You're literally in the stirrups with that sound\"\u2014the device made a loud, painful sounding click\u2014\"and it's like, excuse my language, but what the fuck?\" Most of the designers in the room had never seen a speculum before. Some (the men) had never considered the contents of a pelvic examination\u2014stripping off your clothes, laying on an examination table, and strapping your feet into stirrups, while a doctor pries you open with a cold, metal gadget. But Stewart hadn't gathered her colleagues just to explain what happens to women at their annual exams. She had a greater goal in mind. For the past several months, mostly during down time and on weekends, Stewart and interaction designer Sahana Kumar had been studying this device. They'd wrenched it open and closed, studied the curve of the bills, read endlessly about its history. And now, she told the rest of the designers at Frog, they had taken on what was turning into a particularly ambitious project: redesigning the speculum for the 21st century. The current design of the speculum, fashioned by American physician James Marion Sims, dates back to the 1840s. The device had two pewter blades to separate the vaginal walls, and hinged open and closed with a screw mechanism. Sims, sometimes called the \"father of modern gynecology,\" used the speculum to pioneer treatments for fistula and other complications from childbirth. But his experiments were often conducted on slave women, without the use of anesthesia. So to say that the speculum was not designed with patient comfort in mind would be an egregious understatement. And yet, the speculum today looks almost identical to the one Sims used more than 150 years ago. The most noticeable difference between the original Sims device and the one you can find in gynecological offices today is that instead of pewter, modern specula are made of stainless steel or plastic. That the speculum is old is not, on its face, a problem. It's that the design is neither optimal for patients nor physicians. Doctors have to stretch the speculum's bills wide in order to see as far back as the cervix, and even then, it's not always possible to get a good look inside. (Some specula come with built-in lights, but the problem has more to do with tissue falling in than the darkness of the vaginal canal.) All of that pressure causes discomfort; one review of the medical literature found that some women even avoid the gynecologist because of the dreaded device. Mercy Asiedu In 2014, the American College of Physicians went so far as to recommend against pelvic exams , citing the \"harms, fear, anxiety, embarrassment, pain, and discomfort\" associated with speculum examinations. Those side effects impact gynecologists, too. \"The more comfortable a patient is, the faster they can do their job, the more patients they can see,\" says Stewart. \"There's actual monetary value to [patient] comfort.\" It\u2019s not that nobody\u2019s tried to change things. In 2005, a San Francisco-based company patented the design for an inflatable speculum called FemSpec. The device was made out of polyurethane, the same material used to make condoms; a physician could insert it like a tampon and inflate it like a tiny balloon. It debuted to some fanfare, but ultimately flopped. As an article in The Chicago Times pointed out, most women never even got to experience the new speculum \"because it is so new on the market that most doctors aren't using it.\" \"With a speculum, you just shove it in and expand it as wide as you want to get the visualization you want. With this, you have to put it in and gently move it around, kind of like a joystick.\" \u2014 Biomedical engineer Mercy Asiedu Other do-overs have focused on more modest improvements. A prototype called the Lotus , created by a student at the Pratt Institute, kept the bill shape but curved it slightly for a more ergonomic insertion. The design also included a rotating handle to open the speculum bills vertically, and a hidden lever mechanism to prevent pinching. It seemed promising, but after appearing in a student showcase last year, it never turned into anything real. In Oregon, a group called Ceek Women's Health has begun clinical trials for a series of new devices\u2014including a sleeve, a speculum with narrower bills, and a speculum that patients can self-insert. Their goal is to create a variety of specula to serve a variety of patients, rather than recreating another one-size-fits-all tool. \"For women who have a lot of tissue, women who have had more than two vaginal births or a high BMI, for women with a history of trauma or rape, for post-menopausal women who have vaginal atrophy\u2014there isn't any product to address their needs,\" says Fahti Khosrow, Ceek's co-founder and CEO. Give physicians a whole new toolkit, she says, and they can better serve their patients. Perhaps the most promising new design comes from Duke University, where researchers are testing a device that could circumvent the speculum altogether. Mercy Asiedu, a doctoral candidate in biomedical engineering at Duke, designed a tampon-sized device with a 2 megapixel camera attached to the end. \"The speculum was originally designed for a physician to view the cervix from outside the body,\" Asiedu says, \"but with current technology, you can easily view the cervix from inside the body.\" Asiedu tested her prototype in a pilot study with 15 volunteers this year, the results of which were published in the journal PLOS One in May. Every single patient said the smaller device provided a better experience than the speculum. The Duke study looked at patient satisfaction, and Asiedu acknowledges that physicians may offer more criticism of the device. The design emphasized comfort, modesty, and patient empowerment, not necessarily ease of use for physicians. \"With a speculum, you just shove it in and expand it as wide as you want to get the visualization you want,\" Asiedu says. \"With this, you have to put it in and gently move it around, kind of like a joystick.\" When Stewart and her team set off to redesign the speculum, they knew what they were up against. Plus, Stewart says, \"I hadn't even seen a speculum.\" So before they started researching or sketching ideas out, Stewart and Kumar listed the things that had bothered them in gynecological exams. There was the noise (like a can opener), the temperature (freezing cold), the feeling inside (as if someone was stretching your insides like a rubber band). When they acquired a set of specula, one plastic and one metal, they realized they needed to change the aesthetics too. These things looked like medieval torture devices. First, Stewart explored how to silence that ratcheting sound. She and Fran Wang, a mechanical engineer at Frog, investigated new types of opening mechanisms. No concept was too bizarre. What if, like a pufferfish, they used saline to inflate the device from the inside? Or what if they used air, blowing it up like an air mattress? They looked for inspiration in nature (cobra hoods), in machining (milling chucks), and in everyday objects (bicycle pumps); they studied how a tripod clamps open and shut, how ski bindings clip in and out, searching for ideas that might replace the old-fashioned screw mechanism. Frog Next, they considered new materials. Instead of constructing the device out of plastic or metal, they decided to cover the whole thing in autoclavable silicone\u2014a material that wouldn't feel cold, could be easily sterilized, and would make insertion more comfortable. \"On the metal speculum, there are pokey bits,\" says Wang. \"Those shouldn't go near your delicate body parts! Having all of that covered in silicon, it prevents tissue from getting damaged. And also when you look at it, it's nicer.\" They experimented with using three prongs instead of two, opening the device into a triangle shape. They tried shrinking the device to the size of a tampon, or borrowing design language from the vibrator industry. They put the device's handle at different angles, ranging from 90 degrees to 120 degrees, to find most ergonomic position for physicians. And then they 3-D printed a few different prototypes and put them in the hands of OB/GYNs and medical providers. \"The one they were really excited about was the one that opened up using three bills, rather than just two,\" says Stewart. The triangle-shaped opening gave physicians the same field of view without having to open the bills as wide, making the process less \"stretchy\" for patients. OB/GYNs also liked the device's handle at 110 degrees, which enough extra space between the physician's hand and the patient's body to eliminate the \"last scooch\" down the examination table. The silicon covering was a big hit, too. A button unlocks or locks the speculum with one hand, freeing up the other hand; a push handle eliminates the need for screws. Even more comforting, the speculum was totally silent. Conferring with OB/GYNs made one thing very clear, though: The project wouldn't succeed with redesigned hardware alone. Stewart wondered why she felt more comfortable getting a bikini wax than she did seeing the gynecologist once a year, and the answer boiled down to the environment. One felt cold, clinical, and scary; the other, relaxing and personal, even if it was more physically painful. If they wanted to redesign the speculum, they had to redesign the entire experience. Half a year later, the project has turned into something of a coup d'\u00e9tat on the modern pelvic exam. There's the speculum itself, still in development with the insight from several OB/GYNs who have signed on to help. There's a list of guidelines for physicians, which include simple but meaningful tips like giving patients somewhere to hang their clothes and explaining the components of the exam. \"It's never going to be perfect,\" says Kumar. \"So how do we at least prepare people emotionally for how it's going to be, and make them feel like they got some value out of it at the end?\" There's also a mock-up of an app, which would let patients fill out forms, ask questions, or follow a guided meditation before the exam. Kumar invented a gear kit\u2014a stress ball, socks to cover your feet in the stirrups\u2014to improve patient comfort, alongside the new speculum. The team also added Rachel Hobart, a visual designer at Frog, to help brand the experience. The result is called Yona . For now, the Yona project is still an early-stage design concept. Stewart and Wang are still hashing out new speculum prototypes, while Kumar and Hobart refine the app and experience. They're working with their board of physicians to fine-tune the idea, to negotiate what's feasible and what isn't. And collectively, they're searching for partners who may have similar goals, like the tech-savvy healthcare service One Medical, who can bring Yona from concept into reality. The trickiest part, it seems, is developing something that physicians will actually adopt. It's not lost on the Frog designers that other prototypes have failed after physicians bristled at the idea of investing in something new, either financially (the cost of purchasing a new device) or mentally (the time it takes to learn how to use a new device). Gynecologists have been using the speculum for over a century, and so far, it's worked. Why change now? \"You could create the most beautiful, most unique, most user-friendly device, but if a doctor doesn't want to learn how to use it, your patient's never going to see it,\" Stewart says. But Wang says that's mostly a matter of getting the product out there, showing physicians how great it can be for them and for their patients. She knows the traditional speculum works fine for most gynecologists. \"It passes, but it's not great,\" says Wang. \"But we're working on making it better. When you give [physicians] the option to choose a better one or a worse one, then they're going to choose the better one. But they might not know that until they get that option.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T16:54:09.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8bcd2a88f5c6973a15a0c1b63f24c3fdde0bf645", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjIDkAGY.Jp7SY89oIarVmBdvgjt4Jn86DcmnmE2l8ZPoYtU2qrynXFrDzwhynq28-", "site_full": "www.wired.com", "site": "wired.com", "site_section": "http://www.wired.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Feed: All Latest", "title": "Colloidal Silver Turns You Blue\u2014But Does It Work?", "title_full": "Colloidal Silver Turns You Blue\u2014But Does It Work?", "published": "2017-10-05T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/59d521a376780c0f0eb908e9/191:100/pass/blueman-FA.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 859, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1755, "comments": 2, "shares": 1755}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 38}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8bcd2a88f5c6973a15a0c1b63f24c3fdde0bf645", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjIDkAGY.Jp7SY89oIarVmBdvgjt4Jn86DcmnmE2l8ZPoYtU2qrynXFrDzwhynq28-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mallory Pickett", "published": "2017-10-05T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Colloidal Silver Turns You Blue\u2014But Does It Work?", "text": "The Weird Business Behind a Trendy \"Anti-Aging\" Pill Through the 1960s, most American newborns received silver nitrate eyedrops at birth to prevent eye infections. It\u2019s occasionally still used for that purpose, but silver nitrate had a bad side effect: It burns skin and can cause severe eye damage. That's why, starting in the early 20th century, scientists started suspending silver in water. Protein molecules in the solution surrounded the silver ions, so that only some\u2014but not all\u2014of the ions were released. The idea was to make a formula that was much less irritating than silver nitrate but equally effective at killing bugs. \u201cIn fact,\u201d wrote Henry Crooks, one of the early pioneers, in 1910, \u201cno microbe is known that is not killed by colloidal silver in laboratory experiments in six minutes.\u201d But the colloidal silver solutions were problematic too. It\u2019s very difficult to control or analyze how much of the silver is ionized, so a patient has no way of knowing how much active silver they\u2019re ingesting or applying\u2014rendering it either useless or, on the other extreme, so potent it results in argyria. So colloidal silver was mostly abandoned by the medical establishment, which moved on to safer and more effective applications of silver, such as in wound dressings or as an infection-fighting additive to joint replacements. Recent tests of modern colloidal silver products found they had no significant antimicrobial properties and left most bacteria unscathed (even after six minutes). Even so, colloidal silver never left the drugstore shelves. In 1999 the FDA declared that over-the-counter products containing colloidal silver ingredients were \u201cmisbranded\u201d and \u201cnot generally recognized as safe,\u201d banning its sale as an OTC drug. But in practice that just means it sits on a different shelf in the pharmacy, as a supplement now instead of a medication. Alex Javier and Deb Blossom are not acquainted\u2014nor, in the current political climate, would they likely want to be. Javier is a Ron Paul\u2013loving libertarian who voted for Trump without much hesitation; Blossom was a Bernie fan who happily voted for Hillary. But they have more in common than they might think. Blossom is a yoga teacher, life coach, and energy worker in Santa Monica, California. When she was a child, she watched her mother battle cancer and go through painful chemotherapy that was ultimately unsuccessful. She died when Blossom was 11. Then, in her twenties, Blossom watched her mentor and teacher endure the same experience. \u201cChemotherapy is being sold to a lot of people who don\u2019t need it,\u201d she says. Though Blossom stops short of writing off Western medicine altogether\u2014she thinks it has its strengths, mostly as a diagnostic tool\u2014she\u2019s certainly a skeptic. Javier\u2019s skepticism was shaped by a similar experience. It started during high school. He had always been a rowdy kid, playing sports to keep his energy in check, but in his sophomore year, Javier's doctors and mom decided his hyperactivity needed to be addressed medically. He ended up on a combination of four psychoactive drugs. The side effects were disastrous: He lost 30 pounds, became depressed, and suffered narcoleptic paralysis\u2014waking up without being able to move his body. \u201cIt scared the crap out of me,\u201d he says. Javier is now 36 years old and living in Hartford, Connecticut, where he keeps up a hodgepodge of odd jobs, usually as a substitute teacher or musician. To fill the gaps between work, and for company during his long nights (he\u2019s a serious night owl), he listens to the radio. Local shows sometimes, but also a lot of Infowars, his source for political and medical advice. It was during one of his late-night radio sessions that Javier first started hearing ads for colloidal silver. When a bad flu was going around a few years ago, most of Javier\u2019s friends who got sick ended up taking antibiotics. Javier generally refuses to take antibiotics, so he tried colloidal silver instead. He took it every day, doling out an entire bottle until he was healthy, and he believed he got better faster than his friends. Now he takes it when he has a stomachache or if he thinks he was exposed to something while teaching. \u201cYou see what works for you,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my experience this works.\u201d Blossom\u2014who has a very different media diet\u2014also keeps colloidal silver handy. She mostly uses it for cuts and scrapes on herself and her dog. \u201cIt works incredibly effectively and quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cI've been using it for years.\u201d Like Javier, she thinks the most important thing she can do for her health isn\u2019t to heed the FDA\u2019s warnings but to trust her instincts and her own research. \u201cI don\u2019t subscribe to what the FDA says, nor do I subscribe to what the medical community says, generally,\u201d Blossom says. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are pure in their intentions.\u201d \u201cThe pharmaceutical industries have to raise profit,\u201d Javier says. \u201cSo they\u2019ll do anything they can to increase profit, and if that means suppressing information \u2026 I'm not going to say lie , but there have been a lot of false things.\u201d Blossom makes the same argument: \u201cThe pharma companies' interests are in money, not at all in healing people. It\u2019s a business.\u201d To many, Blossom and Javier will sound like conspiracy-minded cranks. But Sanford Newmark, medical director of the UCSF Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, says paranoia about pharmaceutical companies is \u201cnot entirely misplaced.\u201d Pharmaceutical companies \u201cdo have undue influence over both doctors and the FDA,\u201d he says, pointing to reports of corrupt professors at major institutions receiving kickbacks from Big Pharma and drug companies that publish the results of only the most favorable drug trials. \u201cYou can't assume that that's not going to affect how people will see things,\u201d Newmark says. The Osher Center offers alternative treatments, like acupuncture and meditation, to patients at UCSF. Some are people like Blossom and Javier, cynical about the motives behind their doctor\u2019s prescriptions, but others come because there is no drug that will fix them, or because they don\u2019t like the side effects of what they\u2019re offered. Acupuncture and meditation are treatments that made their way into Western medicine largely via the New Age fringe and have now proven themselves effective enough to be offered at one of the nation\u2019s leading medical institutions. Some so-called alternative therapies are supported by sound scientific evidence. Others just haven\u2019t been studied yet. From a consumer perspective, it\u2019s not easy to discern good evidence from bad, or a lack of research from a consensus perspective that something\u2014like colloidal silver\u2014has been evaluated and discarded. The conclusions each person comes to vary widely depending on the sources they believe, and how they interpret their personal experiences. And even doctors can seemingly change their minds. In 2008, Paul Karason told Oprah and Dr. Oz that he was having a problem with acid reflux. But after incorporating colloidal silver into his daily regimen, \"in less than three days that was gone.\" Dr. Oz appeared incredulous. \"I just can't see using something that fell out of conventional use when we developed antibiotics,\" he said. Fast forward to 2013, when Gwyneth Paltrow came on Dr. Oz's show to talk about how she keeps herself and her family happy and healthy. Colloidal silver was one of her four wellness tips\u2014she said she regularly sprays it under her tongue and on airplane seats to keep viruses away. \"This has a ton of data behind it,\" Oz agreed, having apparently forgotten the blue man he doubted. Oz told Paltrow he uses colloidal silver as a daily throat spray, and so do his kids. \"This was the first antibiotic,\" he said. That same year, at 62 years old, Paul Karason died of a stroke. It was unrelated to his argyria. He had struggled during the final years of his life. He became more reclusive to avoid the stares and had a hard time finding work. Even so, he never stopped taking colloidal silver. Related Video Science What\u2019s Inside a Flu Shot?

Leap forward 10 years, and the typical startup was all about apps on your smartphone, to do everything from touching up selfies, to booking flights, to getting your laundry picked up. Now, we're in the decade of the startup launched to remake transportation \u2014the electric cars, ride sharing networks, and personal flying machines that will transform the way people get around. Lyft, formed in 2012, joined Uber and others in persuading people that\u2019s it\u2019s fine to get into strangers\u2019 cars. Zipline started national drone delivery networks, dropping medical supplies in Rwanda and Tanzania. Tesla made electric propulsion, once the province of eco-warriors, fast and cool. As always, startups form and dissolve like clouds in the sky. Some fail, others are consumed by hungry investors, a few hang on to become household names. And as ever, it's hard to predict which will do what, which merit attention, which are the wannabes destined for bankruptcy. That's why Automobility LA, the trade show dedicated to the converging worlds of tech and transport at the Los Angeles Auto Show, just named 10 transportation startups finalists, it believes are poised for greatness. Picked from a field of 300, these 10 companies are addressing some of the most vexing and important problems standing between us and the future of transportation. They\u2019re inventing new sensors to give driverless cars a picture of the world, new ways to train the artificial intelligence that will control the moving machines of tomorrow, and new methods of accessing them all. \"I don\u2019t think automotive has seen a disruption like this since the automobile was invented and we replaced horses,\" says Manuela Papadopol, who directs business development at car software supplier Elecktrobit, and is running the competition for the LA Auto Show. She believes startups are going to be crucial as the world moves to electric propulsion and self-driving vehicles. Future vehicles will need to sense the world, if they're going to drive themselves, and developments in this area are happening fast. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting area to be in,\u201d says Dean Zody, CEO of GhostWave . The Columbus, Ohio-based startup is making radar sensors that are less prone to interference, which it says will be crucial when the roads are flooded with self-driving cars relying on them for collision avoidance. Ghostwave is up against Neteera Technologies , which is working on Terahertz sensors, which could give driverless cars superhuman senses, allowing them to scan the environment with a novel sensor that blends lidar and radar. Again, the hope is to avoid the perils of interference. Also in the final 10 is Innoviz Technologies , an Isreali company developing solid-state lidar. Those laser sensors are widely viewed as essential to the development of self-driving cars, but the current \u201cKFC bucket\u201d designs with spinning mirrors are expensive and fragile. Solid state sensors, with no moving parts, would fix that. \u201cThere are different companies trying to solve the problem in different ways, which is a very interesting stage for this industry,\u201d says Oren Rozenzweig, chief business officer. \u201cIt really depends who gets to the finish line with a good product.\u201d And gets it in front of the right eyeballs. The cars of the future will require brains, too. Mighty AI gamifies the training of the artificial intelligence brains, and then crowdsources it. \u201cThe automotive space is one of the hottest and most advanced fields applying machine learning,\u201d Matt Bencke, CEO of the company, told WIRED this summer. Ultimately, profit is king, so Cerebri AI , a company that uses AI to figure out how to make money from drivers and their interactions with the world, makes the top 10 list, too. WayRay could play a part in that interaction\u2014it's making holographic augmented reality tech for connected cars. Think Blade Runner -style billboards thrown up on windscreens. In the future, you're less likely to own your own car, and more likely to rely on grabbing one when you need it. At least, that's the business model of three more top tenners. \"We believe that new mobility is becoming the new reality \u2013 in a few short years, we are going to see a major decrease in private vehicle ownership in favor of carsharing and ridesharing,\" says Ridecell boss Aarjav Trivedi. His startup is building a software backbone for other companies to get their rideshare plans up and running quickly. GoKid bills itself as a complete carpool solution for schools, teams, and active families. SPLT is trying carpooling with a trusted community of commuters who want to share a ride to work. And when they're done with all that running around, these shared, electric cars will need to top-up their batteries. The final entrant, EV Safe Charge , is developing electric vehicle charging infrastructure. It\u2019s a varied list, which later this year, judges will whittle down to three finalists, who\u2019ll receive prizes like entrance to industry tradeshows, and sample hardware from Microsoft, NVIDIA, Porsche Consulting, and Elektrobit. One grand prize winner will get an advisory session with the judges\u2014a good time for a sales pitch perhaps\u2014and \u201csignificant prizes to help further grow their business.\" But the real prize for a competition like this isn't money. It's exposure. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a booth in the startup area, people see our banner, and say hey, yeah, that\u2019s a problem, how are you fixing it?\u201d says Ghostwave\u2019s Zody. It\u2019s a question all of the ten finalists will have to get used to. And for the auto industry, it's a chance to spot the next big investment. Papadopol says only 6 percent of the money flowing into automotive startups comes from traditional car builders, the rest comes from venture capital firms and tech companies. If the old school car makers want to stay competitive, they'll have to merge with or buy companies solving the problems of the future. These 10 are a good place to start.

Star Trek is coming at you from at least two directions. A good chunk of the Marvel movies are basically space opera. Bigscreen fascination with science fiction and fantasy is nothing new\u2014but now you can add the many flavors of TV network, from legacy broadcast to basic cable to streamers. Forget comic books; somehow, SF/F novels have become Hollywood\u2019s hottest IP. Some highlights of what may be on its way: Amazon is making Neal Stephenson\u2019s Snow Crash and Larry Niven\u2019s Ringworld , and a show based on Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman's Good Omens is in production. Universal is doing Hugh Howey\u2019s Sand , Maggie Stiefvater\u2019s Raven series, Kurt Vonnegut Jr.\u2019s Sirens of Titan (with Community genius Dan Harmon at the helm), and Roger Zelazny\u2019s Lord of Light , a.k.a. the movie that the CIA pretended to be making when they rescued American diplomats from Iran\u2014a story that was itself the basis for the movie Argo . Done yet? Nope! HBO is making Nnedi Okorafor\u2019s Who Fears Death? Netflix is making JG Ballard\u2019s Hello America and Daniel Suarez\u2019s Change Agent . And Lionsgate is making Patrick Rothfuss\u2019 Kingkiller Chronicle series. Phew. Sure, some of these shows will never make it out of development; others won\u2019t last a full season. Runaway successes like Game of Thrones and The Handmaid\u2019s Tale make it worth the effort; Hollywood is nothing if not willing to keep doing what already worked. Besides, the saga of Westeros is about to wrap up, and then who'll take the reins of fire? All those various networks and services have offered up plenty of original sci-fi, too, of course. Stranger Things is the obvious standout there. And I\u2019ll do you a solid and point you at Travelers on Netflix, a wickedly clever time travel show from Canada, due for a second season this year. Some deeper incentives might be behind the raiding of the science-fiction section, though. Familiar intellectual property has two advantages for a TV network. First, it\u2019s already vetted. An editor with experience in science fiction has already made the sign of the IDIC over it and fired it out of a photon torpedo tube. Its characters, its world, and at least the skeleton of its plot live in the fictional universe. As a consequence, TV makers don't need tea leaves\u2014they can just look at Bookscan and get a sense of how big their built-in audience is. That\u2019s never certain, and the number of people who read Snow Crash , genius though it is, probably isn\u2019t big enough to turn it into a massive hit. But then again, viewership and ratings don\u2019t have the same importance they once did, especially for streaming services. The Amazons, Hulus, and Netflices of the world are more interested in prestige, in must-subscribe programming, and\u2014as a proxy for those other two things\u2014maybe even in Emmys and glowing press coverage. (Quick counterpoint: Syfy\u2019s The Expanse , likewise based on a successful series of books, hasn\u2019t gotten the same attention or audience\u2014which is too bad; it\u2019s cool.) Plus, genre often ends up being easier to market than \"straight\" or more literary drama. Take The Man in the High Castle , based on the Philip K. Dick novel. \"What if the Nazis won World War II?\" Pow. Now try to find a logline like that with, say, Atlanta . Meanwhile, the larger multiverse of IP sources has become more constrained. The worlds of comic books and big sci-fi franchises are bottled up and decanted among various studios already. (That said, I\u2019m super-psyched to see Greg Rucka and Michael Lark\u2019s Lazarus and Ed Brubaker and Steve Epting\u2019s Velvet comic books, from the creator-owned imprint Image, getting TV development deals, too. Lazarus is political, dystopian sci-fi and Velvet turns a Ms. Moneypenny-like character into a superspy on the run.) Demand for overall television content is high. Demand for genre content is high. The choices are: Either take a risk and make original stuff, or take slightly less of a risk with a known quantity from somewhere. Anywhere . Movies used to be the only medium that would try to adapt something as ambitious as a book. In sci-fi and fantasy, sometimes that\u2019d give you the Lord of the Rings trilogy (yay!) and sometimes it\u2019d give you The Dark Tower (um). But now that premium television makers have realized that it\u2019s easier to unspool the stuff books are best at\u2014details, set pieces, emotional journeys\u2014in six or 10 or 15 hours than in a mere two. TV\u2019s looking for books; books work better on TV. For the kind of people who roll science fiction books on their Kindle like a development agent rolls calls during casting season, this middle is a very good one to be caught in.

It is, as promised, shaped like a skinny pyramid, the remnant of a shield volcano. It is decidedly supervillain-lair-ish. In 2003, scientists scaled its sheer cliffs in search of the only thing more bizarre than the island itself: the Lord Howe Island stick insect , so named because it is, as promised, rather stick-like. It\u2019s also enormous, growing to six inches long, with a dark, robust abdomen and chunky back legs. The researchers managed to bag just two breeding pairs, because Lord Howe Island stick insect was, and remains, one of the rarest critters on the planet. A century ago, this big 'ol bug thrived on\u2014you guessed it\u2014Lord Howe Island, a crescent-shaped volcanic remnant 12 miles away from Ball's Pyramid. But in 1918, an unexpected shipment of invasive rats (they were stowaways on a boat, which shipwrecked) annihilated the arthropods. For decades, the six-legged giants were presumed extinct. But in 2001, a team of scientists found stick insects living on Ball\u2019s Pyramid. But something was amiss. The Ball's Pyramid bugs were considerably stockier than ones collected from Lord Howe Island, and the males had bigger spines on their legs. The differences were great enough to raise questions: Was this the Lord Howe Island stick insect living somewhere new, or was it a different species altogether? To find out, scientists would have to compare the DNA from the descendants of these captured insects with museum specimens from Lord Howe Island. But the DNA in museum specimens has a habit of decaying over time, stymying efforts to sequence it. The technology to do it just didn\u2019t exist back then. But now it does. Today in the journal Current Biology , researchers announced that they\u2019ve successfully compared the genomes of the two groups of insects to confirm that, yes, even though the bugs look quite different, the divergence in their DNA is actually less than 1 percent. It is, in fact, the Lord Howe Island stick insect camping out on an inhospitable pyramid. That may seem like a semantic squabble to you (who cares what you call the beast?), but it actually has big implications for the planned restoration of Lord Howe Island, and for the very idea of what a species even is. Now, here\u2019s the neat bit. The researchers also compared the Lord Howe Island museum specimens with one another, and found that the diversion there was about half a percent. \u201cSo the diversions within the island are basically of the same magnitude as they are between a Lord Howe Island and Ball's Pyramid,\u201d says Sasha Mikheyev , an evolutionary biologist at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology and the study's lead author. Why the Ball\u2019s Pyramid population would look different than the extinct population from Lord Howe is still a mystery, though the bigger leg spikes may be used in some kind of sexual competition. Also unclear is how and when the stick insects got to the Pyramid in the first place, though more genetic testing could clarify when the populations began their subtle divergence. Still: Science says they're the same species. The problem is, scientists have a hard time agreeing on what exactly a species is in the first place. \u201cThe last time I checked, there's something like 53 different species concepts that are published in the literature and used,\u201d says California Academy of Sciences arachnologist Lauren Esposito , who was not involved in the study. It used to be that a species was more or less a group of animals that could breed with one another. That gets problematic, though, when you consider that different species can get together and produce offspring. Think about a mule, which is the product of a horse and a donkey. Mules, though, are sterile. So maybe a species is a group of animals that can breed and produce fertile offspring. But ah, a polar bear can breed with a grizzly to create a pizzly , which is fertile. So yeah, it's a definitional mess. But now, increasingly powerful genetic testing is precisely quantifying what it means to be a species, instead of biologists eyeballing individuals for shared traits and seeing if they breed. Here, too, museum specimens and their fragile DNA have a role to play. \u201cLuckily for museum scientists, a lot of the methods that are emerging are sequencing really short fragments of DNA,\u201d Esposito says. This study \u201creally for me highlights the value of having historic museum material, and how that material can have unexpected importance in the future.\u201d More Critters ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T19:34:56.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8c3c806648219b46af7c8ee09efaabf2c497d9bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjIDkAGY.Jp7SY89oIarVm_FzDv39S_Zi5m1rr_saZ0ilfeCtExBpRLCqCR5twhno-", "site_full": "www.wired.com", "site": "wired.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.wired.com/wired/index", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Feed: All Latest", "title": "Inside SynTouch, the Mad Lab Giving Robots the Power to Feel", "title_full": "Inside SynTouch, the Mad Lab Giving Robots the Power to Feel", "published": "2017-10-05T20:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/59d55aefe93c753d4cd54ae2/191:100/pass/touch-FA.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 859, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 369, "comments": 0, "shares": 369}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 206}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8c3c806648219b46af7c8ee09efaabf2c497d9bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjIDkAGY.Jp7SY89oIarVm_FzDv39S_Zi5m1rr_saZ0ilfeCtExBpRLCqCR5twhno-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matt Simon", "published": "2017-10-05T20:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Inside SynTouch, the Mad Lab Giving Robots the Power to Feel", "text": "01:11 pm Inside SynTouch, the Mad Lab Giving Robots the Power to Feel When you think about it, touch is a bizarre sense. Unlike sound or light, tactile properties can be difficult to quantify. You can measure decibels or lumens, but touch is a subjective sense with subjective descriptions, like rough or squishy or cold . Subjective until now, that is. A company called SynTouch, which spun out of the University of Southern California, has created a robotic fingertip that rubs a material and precisely measures the \u201cfeel\u201d of it in 15 dimensions, ranging from coarseness to coolness. And that\u2019s pivotal for a future in which robots interact closely with humans. Our sense of touch allows us to grip a water bottle gently and a crowbar more firmly, and the robots need to do the same. We wouldn\u2019t want them crushing dishes and chairs and skulls, now would we? This robot finger doesn\u2019t feel the world like yours, which relies on nerves. Embedded in a dome shape are 19 super-sensitive electrodes, over which a skin of silicon is stretched. The space in between is then injected with saline. So when you press the finger against something, the electrodes measure the changing resistance through the saltwater. The robot can sense how much pressure it\u2019s applying, and quantify the give of the material it's applying pressure to. To measure texture, the finger monitors for vibrations. \u201cSo if I slide over a textured surface like my suit jacket, you'll see these high frequency oscillations that are essentially the texture that you get,\u201d says SynTouch CEO and co-founder Gerald Loeb. \u201cIf I slide it over a different surface there would be a different pattern of vibrations which I could analyze to say the difference between, for instance, the wool of my jacket and the cotton of my shirt.\u201d This thing measures temperature, too\u2014and with more subtlety than you might think. Now, the reason a tile floor feels colder than carpet isn\u2019t that they\u2019re different temperatures. Even if they're both room temperature, the tile will feel colder because it transfers heat from your bare foot faster than the carpet .

Brooks Kraft/Getty Images The NSA is one of the world's most notoriously secretive and powerful government agencies, guarding its powerful hacking tools and massive caches of collected data under layers of security clearances and world-class technical protections. But it turns out that three times in three years, that expensive security has been undone by one of its own contract employees simply carrying those secrets out the door. In 2013, an NSA contractor named Edward Snowden walked out of the agency's building in Oahu, Hawaii, carrying a USB drive full of thousands of top-secret documents. Last year, a 53-year-old Booz Allen contractor for the NSA named Hal Martin was arrested last year for taking 50 terabytes out of the agency over a period as long two decades. And Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that in 2015, a third contract employee of the NSA in as many years took home a trove of classified materials that included both software code and other information that the agency uses in its offensive hacking operations, as well as details of how it protects US systems from hacker adversaries. That classified data, which wasn't authorized to be removed from the perimeter of the facility where that contractor worked, was then stolen from the contractor's home computer by Russian spies, who exploited the unnamed employee's installation of antivirus software from Kaspersky, a Russian company. And while that revelation has raised yet another round of serious concerns and unanswered questions about Kremlin spying and the role of Kaspersky's widely used commercial software, it also points to a more fundamental security problem for the NSA: The own-goals it has committed, as a series of its paid employees spill some of its most sensitive secrets\u2014including its intensely guarded and dangerous hacking techniques. While Kaspersky is one major\u2014though possibly unintentional\u2014culprit in this latest theft of secrets, the root cause of the breach is the deep negligence of the NSA employee who violated his security clearance by taking incredibly sensitive materials home, says Dave Aitel, a former NSA staffer who now runs the security firm Immunity Inc. \"What are the hell are these people thinking?\" asks Aitel. \"Leaving the NSA with top-secret documents and putting them on your home machine is the very first thing they tell you not to do. Why it keeps happening is a mystery to me, and probably to the management at NSA.\" Going Rogue The revelation of the latest unidentified contractor, whose employer also hasn't been publicly named, comes a year after Martin was caught leaving sensitive data on hard drives in his home and car, a collection that included 75 percent percent of the hacking tools used by the NSA's elite hacking team, known as Tailored Access Operations, according to the Washington Post . Prosecutors in Martin's case have said the data also contained the highly secret identities of undercover agents. It's not yet clear if either Martin or the most recent contractor to breach the agency's secrecy rules had any intention of selling or exploiting the documents they took. The latest incident in particular seems to be a case of carelessness, rather than profit or malice, according to the Wall Street Journal 's reporting . Both of those leaks contrast with the whistleblowing-motivated data thefts of Edward Snowden\u2014another Booz Allen contractor\u2014who stole his thousands of top secret files with the intention of giving them to media. 'What are the hell are these people thinking?' Former NSA analyst Dave Aitel But in the wake of the leaks carried out by Snowden, this third contractor breach points to a continuing problem with the NSA's operational security and contractor management, one serious enough that NSA director Admiral Michael Rogers was officially reprimanded by his superiors, and some high-ranking officials suggested to President Obama he be removed from his position, according to some reports last year . Rogers nonetheless maintained control of the NSA under the Trump administration. An NSA spokesperson declined to comment on \"personnel issues or ongoing investigations,\" but did defend the agency's security posture. \"Admiral Rogers has made security of information a top priority during his tenure. The NSA operates in one of the most complicated IT environments in the world,\" the spokesperson says. \"Over the past several years, we have continued to build on internal security improvements while carrying out our mission to defend the nation and our allies around the clock. We are not relying only on one initiative. Instead we have undertaken a comprehensive and layered set of enterprise defensive measures to further safeguard operations and advance best practices across the intelligence community.\" The NSA press office declined to elaborate on those measures, or provide more detail. Leak Damage The NSA's two most recent leaks may in fact have already had massively damaging, observable consequences: Many in the security community speculate\u2014but have not confirmed\u2014that the Shadow Brokers, a group of unidentified hackers who released a series of stolen NSA hacking tools over the last year, obtained that hacking arsenal from one of the two post-Snowden insider leaks. Those tools have already been reused by malicious criminal and state-sponsored hackers to spread the WannaCry ransomware worm as well as the NotPetya malware , to install crypto-currency mining malware on victims' machines, and to harvest usernames and passwords from high-value spying targets via hotel Wi-Fi . And yet the leaks continue. That's possibly because as dangerous as the \"insider threat\" problem may be, it has no easy solution, says Susan Hennessey, a former NSA attorney who now serves as a fellow at the Brookings Institution. If someone wants to ferret secrets out of their own office, there are simply too many ways to do it, perhaps most straightforwardly on a USB drive in their pocket. \"You can\u2019t run a large federal agency like an airport, where every single person is patted down and screened coming in and out,\" Hennessey says. \"Hiring practices and clearance investigations and computer security can address some concerns, but at the end of the day intelligence agencies necessarily have to vest a lot of trust in their employees. So effective insider threat measures have to begin with a recognition that some risks can\u2019t be eliminated, only managed.\" But the NSA's cozy relationship with contractors bears much of the blame, too, says Tim Shorrock, the author of the book Spies for Hire , which focuses on corruption in the intelligence-contractor industry. He notes that contractors account for close to 30 percent of agency staff, and 60 percent of their budgets. He sees the three recent breaches as evidence that those massive payouts aren't accompanied by proper oversight. \"They're leaving way too much authority to the contractors to police themselves and it\u2019s clear that system is failing,\" Shorrock says. \"There needs to be some kind of mechanism to police the contractors.\" 'Effective insider threat measures have to begin with a recognition that some risks can\u2019t be eliminated, only managed.' Former NSA Lawyer Susan Hennessey Shorrock also points to a lack of consequences for the companies who supplied the contractors behind the recent breaches. He argues that stems in part from the revolving door of officials between the intelligence agencies and the private sector; both the directors of national intelligence under Presidents Obama and George W. Bush had previously worked for Booz Allen, for instance. But former NSA analyst Aitel believes the cultural issues at the NSA run deeper than contractors alone. He says it was common during his time at the agency to see core NSA staffers do work at home, too\u2014albeit not with actual classified documents\u2014reading news stories and public sources of information security reports, digging up technical information, and even talking on the phone with each other in vague or coded terms, which he considers especially unwise. Aitel argues that the NSA's recent leaks stem from a more fundamental problem: The agency's sheer scale, and a structure that doesn't restrict its staffers often enough to information on a \"need-to-know\" basis. \"There\u2019s something structurally wrong here,\" Aitel says. \"This is about scale and segmentation. It\u2019s very hard to have a really big team where everyone\u2019s read in on everything and not have it leak.\" Related Video Security Worried About Your Weak Passwords?

Hailey Stewart, one of Frog's industrial designers, had scattered an array of prototypes on a table. On one end, you could see cylinders of foam that looked almost like skinny vibrators, with handles that stuck out at different angles and sketches of levers and screw mechanisms. And on the other, the common speculum\u2014the device used in routine gynecological exams to inspect the cervix. Stewart picked one up and cranked it open. \"You're literally in the stirrups with that sound\"\u2014the device made a loud, painful sounding click\u2014\"and and it's like, excuse my language, but what the fuck?\" \nMost of the designers in the room had never seen a speculum before. Some (the men) had never considered the contents of a pelvic examination\u2014stripping off your clothes, laying on an examination table, and strapping your feet into stirrups, while a doctor pries you open with a cold, metal gadget. But Stewart hadn't gathered her colleagues just to explain what happens to women at their annual exams. She had a greater goal in mind. \nFor the past several months, mostly during down time and on weekends, Stewart and interaction designer Sahana Kumar had been studying this device. They'd wrenched it open and closed, studied the curve of the bills, read endlessly about its history. And now, she told the rest of the designers at Frog, they had taken on what was turning into a particularly ambitious project: redesigning the speculum for the 21st century. \nThe current design of the speculum, fashioned by American physician James Marion Sims, dates back to the 1840s. The device had two pewter blades to separate the vaginal walls, and hinged open and closed with a screw mechanism. Sims, sometimes called the \"father of modern gynecology,\" used the speculum to pioneer treatments for fistula and other complications from childbirth. But his experiments were often conducted on slave women, without the use of anesthesia. So to say that the speculum was not designed with patient comfort in mind would be an egregious understatement. \nAnd yet, the speculum today looks almost identical to the one Sims used more than 150 years ago. The most noticeable difference between the original Sims device and the one you can find in gynecological offices today is that instead of pewter, modern specula are made of stainless steel or plastic. \nThat the speculum is old is not, on its face, a problem. It's that the design is neither optimal for patients nor physicians. Doctors have to stretch the speculum's bills wide in order to see as far back as the cervix, and even then, it's not always possible to get a good look inside. (Some specula come with built-in lights, but the problem has more to do with tissue falling in than the darkness of the vaginal canal.) All of that pressure causes discomfort; one review of the medical literature found that some women even avoid the gynecologist because of the dreaded device. x-default Mercy Asiedu \nIn 2014, the American College of Physicians went so far as to recommend against pelvic exams , citing the \"harms, fear, anxiety, embarrassment, pain, and discomfort\" associated with speculum examinations. Those side effects impact gynecologists, too. \"The more comfortable a patient is, the faster they can do their job, the more patients they can see,\" says Stewart. \"There's actual monetary value to [patient] comfort.\" \nIt\u2019s not that nobody\u2019s tried to change things. In 2005, a San Francisco-based company patented the design for an inflatable speculum called FemSpec. The device was made out of polyurethane, the same material used to make condoms; a physician could insert it like a tampon and inflate it like a tiny balloon. It debuted to some fanfare, but ultimately flopped. As an article in The Chicago Times pointed out, most women never even got to experience the new speculum \"because it is so new on the market that most doctors aren't using it.\" \n\"With a speculum, you just shove it in and expand it as wide as you want to get the visualization you want. With this, you have to put it in and gently move it around, kind of like a joystick.\"\u2014 Biomedical engineer Mercy Asiedu \nOther do-overs have focused on more modest improvements. A prototype called the Lotus , created by a student at the Pratt Institute, kept the bill shape but curved it slightly for a more ergonomic insertion. The design also included a rotating handle to open the speculum bills vertically, and a hidden lever mechanism to prevent pinching. It seemed promising, but after appearing in a student showcase last year, it never turned into anything real. \nIn Oregon, a group called Ceek Women's Health has begun clinical trials for a series of new devices\u2014including a sleeve, a speculum with narrower bills, and a speculum that patients can self-insert. Their goal is to create a variety of specula to serve a variety of patients, rather than recreating another one-size-fits-all tool. \"For women who have a lot of tissue, women who have had more than two vaginal births or a high BMI, for women with a history of trauma or rape, for post-menopausal women who have vaginal atrophy\u2014there isn't any product to address their needs,\" says Fahti Khosrow, Ceek's co-founder and CEO. Give physicians a whole new toolkit, she says, and they can better serve their patients. \nPerhaps the most promising new design comes from Duke University, where researchers are testing a device that could circumvent the speculum altogether. Mercy Asiedu, a doctoral candidate in biomedical engineering at Duke, designed a tampon-sized device with a 2 megapixel camera attached to the end. \"The speculum was originally designed for a physician to view the cervix from outside the body,\" Asiedu says, \"but with current technology, you can easily view the cervix from inside the body.\" \nAsiedu tested her prototype in a pilot study with 15 volunteers this year, the results of which were published in the journal PLOS One in May. Every single patient said the smaller device provided a better experience than the speculum. \nThe Duke study looked at patient satisfaction, and Asiedu acknowledges that physicians may offer more criticism of the device. The design emphasized comfort, modesty, and patient empowerment, not necessarily ease of use for physicians. \"With a speculum, you just shove it in and expand it as wide as you want to get the visualization you want,\" Asiedu says. \"With this, you have to put it in and gently move it around, kind of like a joystick.\" \nWhen Stewart and her team set off to redesign the speculum, they knew what they were up against. Plus, Stewart says, \"I hadn't even seen a speculum.\" \nSo before they started researching or sketching ideas out, Stewart and Kumar listed the things that had bothered them in gynecological exams. There was the noise (like a can opener), the temperature (freezing cold), the feeling inside (as if someone was stretching your insides like a rubber band). When they acquired a set of specula, one plastic and one metal, they realized they needed to change the aesthetics too. These things looked like medieval torture devices. \nFirst, Stewart explored how to silence that ratcheting sound. She and Fran Wang, a mechanical engineer at Frog, investigated new types of opening mechanisms. No concept was too bizarre. What if, like a pufferfish, they used saline to inflate the device from the inside? Or what if they used air, blowing it up like an air mattress? They looked for inspiration in nature (cobra hoods), in machining (milling chucks), and in everyday objects (bicycle pumps); they studied how a tripod clamps open and shut, how ski bindings clip in and out, searching for ideas that might replace the old-fashioned screw mechanism. Frog \nNext, they considered new materials. Instead of constructing the device out of plastic or metal, they decided to cover the whole thing in autoclavable silicone\u2014a material that wouldn't feel cold, could be easily sterilized, and would make insertion more comfortable. \"On the metal speculum, there are pokey bits,\" says Wang. \"Those shouldn't go near your delicate body parts! Having all of that covered in silicon, it prevents tissue from getting damaged. And also when you look at it, it's nicer.\" \nThey experimented with using three prongs instead of two, opening the device into a triangle shape. They tried shrinking the device to the size of a tampon, or borrowing design language from the vibrator industry. They put the device's handle at different angles, ranging from 90 degrees to 120 degrees, to find most ergonomic position for physicians. And then they 3-D printed a few different prototypes and put them in the hands of OB/GYNs and medical providers. \n\"The one they were really excited about was the one that opened up using three bills, rather than just two,\" says Stewart. The triangle-shaped opening gave physicians the same field of view without having to open the bills as wide, making the process less \"stretchy\" for patients. OB/GYNs also liked the device's handle at 110 degrees, which enough extra space between the physician's hand and the patient's body to eliminate the \"last scooch\" down the examination table. The silicon covering was a big hit, too. A button unlocks or locks the speculum with one hand, freeing up the other hand; a push handle eliminates the need for screws. Even more comforting, the speculum was totally silent. \nConferring with OB/GYNs made one thing very clear, though: The project wouldn't succeed with redesigned hardware alone. Stewart wondered why she felt more comfortable getting a bikini wax than she did seeing the gynecologist once a year, and the answer boiled down to the environment. One felt cold, clinical, and scary; the other, relaxing and personal, even if it was more physically painful. If they wanted to redesign the speculum, they had to redesign the entire experience. \nHalf a year later, the project has turned into something of a coup d'\u00e9tat on the modern pelvic exam. There's the speculum itself, still in development with the insight from several OB/GYNs who have signed on to help. There's a list of guidelines for physicians, which include simple but meaningful tips like giving patients somewhere to hang their clothes and explaining the components of the exam. \"It's never going to be perfect,\" says Kumar. \"So how do we at least prepare people emotionally for how it's going to be, and make them feel like they got some value out of it at the end?\" \nThere's also a mock-up of an app, which would let patients fill out forms, ask questions, or follow a guided meditation before the exam. Kumar invented a gear kit\u2014a stress ball, socks to cover your feet in the stirrups\u2014to improve patient comfort, alongside the new speculum. The team also added Rachel Hobart, a visual designer at Frog, to help brand the experience. The result is called Yona . \nFor now, the Yona project is still an early-stage design concept. Stewart and Wang are still hashing out new speculum prototypes, while Kumar and Hobart refine the app and experience. They're working with their board of physicians to fine-tune the idea, to negotiate what's feasible and what isn't. And collectively, they're searching for partners who may have similar goals, like the tech-savvy healthcare service One Medical, who can bring Yona from concept into reality. \nThe trickiest part, it seems, is developing something that physicians will actually adopt. It's not lost on the Frog designers that other prototypes have failed after physicians bristled at the idea of investing in something new, either financially (the cost of purchasing a new device) or mentally (the time it takes to learn how to use a new device). Gynecologists have been using the speculum for over a century, and so far, it's worked. Why change now? \"You could create the most beautiful, most unique, most user-friendly device, but if a doctor doesn't want to learn how to use it, your patient's never going to see it,\" Stewart says. \nBut Wang says that's mostly a matter of getting the product out there, showing physicians how great it can be for them and for their patients. She knows the traditional speculum works fine for most gynecologists. \"It passes, but it's not great,\" says Wang. \"But we're working on making it better. When you give [physicians] the option to choose a better one or a worse one, then they're going to choose the better one. But they might not know that until they get that option.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T08:04:12.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d78fd4acc08029953caf80944217671eac4576be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjIDkAGY.Jpyi0W3_mw_sKCu5Xc1vrWtfU4j8.fb4tGWP5Zg1m5n9_TgKuOsqngBe.vZB.q1s0RNXQ394X9h.t2z94U3vXvYMvjYkZqpCD6ISPHxTA2aiT", "site_full": "www.wired.com", "site": "wired.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.cnevids.com/brand/wired.mrss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WIRED Videos", "title": "Go Inside the Lab That\u2019s Giving Robots a Sense of Touch", "title_full": "Go Inside the Lab That\u2019s Giving Robots a Sense of Touch", "published": "2017-10-05T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/wired_go-inside-the-lab-that-s-giving-robots-a-sense-of-touch-4-1200x630.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 859, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5, "comments": 0, "shares": 5}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d78fd4acc08029953caf80944217671eac4576be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjIDkAGY.Jpyi0W3_mw_sKCu5Xc1vrWtfU4j8.fb4tGWP5Zg1m5n9_TgKuOsqngBe.vZB.q1s0RNXQ394X9h.t2z94U3vXvYMvjYkZqpCD6ISPHxTA2aiT", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T13:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Go Inside the Lab That\u2019s Giving Robots a Sense of Touch", "text": "Science 10.05.17 6:00 am Go Inside the Lab That\u2019s Giving Robots a Sense of Touch \nGo inside Syntouch, the laboratory developing a robotic finger that senses pressure, heat, and texture.

Leap forward 10 years, and the typical startup was all about apps on your smartphone, to do everything from touching up selfies, to booking flights, to getting your laundry picked up. \nNow, we're in the decade of the startup launched to remake transportation \u2014the electric cars, ride sharing networks, and personal flying machines that will transform the way people get around. \nLyft, formed in 2012, joined Uber and others in persuading people that\u2019s it\u2019s fine to get into strangers\u2019 cars. Zipline started national drone delivery networks, dropping medical supplies in Rwanda and Tanzania. Tesla made electric propulsion, once the province of eco-warriors, fast and cool. \nAs always, startups form and dissolve like clouds in the sky. Some fail, others are consumed by hungry investors, a few hang on to become household names. And as ever, it's hard to predict which will do what, which merit attention, which are the wannabes destined for bankruptcy. That's why Automobility LA, the trade show dedicated to the converging worlds of tech and transport at the Los Angeles Auto Show, just named 10 transportation startups finalists, it believes are poised for greatness. \nPicked from a field of 300, these 10 companies are addressing some of the most vexing and important problems standing between us and the future of transportation. They\u2019re inventing new sensors to give driverless cars a picture of the world, new ways to train the artificial intelligence that will control the moving machines of tomorrow, and new methods of accessing them all. \n\"I don\u2019t think automotive has seen a disruption like this since the automobile was invented and we replaced horses,\" says Manuela Papadopol, who directs business development at car software supplier Elecktrobit, and is running the competition for the LA Auto Show. She believes startups are going to be crucial as the world moves to electric propulsion and self-driving vehicles. \nFuture vehicles will need to sense the world, if they're going to drive themselves, and developments in this area are happening fast. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting area to be in,\u201d says Dean Zody, CEO of GhostWave . The Columbus, Ohio-based startup is making radar sensors that are less prone to interference, which it says will be crucial when the roads are flooded with self-driving cars relying on them for collision avoidance. \nGhostwave is up against Neteera Technologies , which is working on Terahertz sensors, which could give driverless cars superhuman senses, allowing them to scan the environment with a novel sensor that blends lidar and radar. Again, the hope is to avoid the perils of interference. Also in the final 10 is Innoviz Technologies , an Isreali company developing solid-state lidar. Those laser sensors are widely viewed as essential to the development of self-driving cars, but the current \u201cKFC bucket\u201d designs with spinning mirrors are expensive and fragile. Solid state sensors, with no moving parts, would fix that. \u201cThere are different companies trying to solve the problem in different ways, which is a very interesting stage for this industry,\u201d says Oren Rozenzweig, chief business officer. \u201cIt really depends who gets to the finish line with a good product.\u201d And gets it in front of the right eyeballs. \nThe cars of the future will require brains, too. Mighty AI gamifies the training of the artificial intelligence brains, and then crowdsources it. \u201cThe automotive space is one of the hottest and most advanced fields applying machine learning,\u201d Matt Bencke, CEO of the company, told WIRED this summer. \nUltimately, profit is king, so Cerebri AI , a company that uses AI to figure out how to make money from drivers and their interactions with the world, makes the top 10 list, too. WayRay could play a part in that interaction\u2014it's making holographic augmented reality tech for connected cars. Think Blade Runner -style billboards thrown up on windscreens. \nIn the future, you're less likely to own your own car, and more likely to rely on grabbing one when you need it. At least, that's the business model of three more top tenners. \"We believe that new mobility is becoming the new reality \u2013 in a few short years, we are going to see a major decrease in private vehicle ownership in favor of carsharing and ridesharing,\" says Ridecell boss Aarjav Trivedi. His startup is building a software backbone for other companies to get their rideshare plans up and running quickly. GoKid bills itself as a complete carpool solution for schools, teams, and active families. SPLT is trying carpooling with a trusted community of commuters who want to share a ride to work. \nAnd when they're done with all that running around, these shared, electric cars will need to top-up their batteries. The final entrant, EV Safe Charge , is developing electric vehicle charging infrastructure. \nIt\u2019s a varied list, which later this year, judges will whittle down to three finalists, who\u2019ll receive prizes like entrance to industry tradeshows, and sample hardware from Microsoft, NVIDIA, Porsche Consulting, and Elektrobit. One grand prize winner will get an advisory session with the judges\u2014a good time for a sales pitch perhaps\u2014and \u201csignificant prizes to help further grow their business.\" \nBut the real prize for a competition like this isn't money. It's exposure. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a booth in the startup area, people see our banner, and say hey, yeah, that\u2019s a problem, how are you fixing it?\u201d says Ghostwave\u2019s Zody. It\u2019s a question all of the ten finalists will have to get used to. \nAnd for the auto industry, it's a chance to spot the next big investment. Papadopol says only 6 percent of the money flowing into automotive startups comes from traditional car builders, the rest comes from venture capital firms and tech companies. If the old school car makers want to stay competitive, they'll have to merge with or buy companies solving the problems of the future. These 10 are a good place to start.

Enthusiasts buy a basic frame and DIY from there, adding suspension, a transponder, and a motor powered by batteries or gas. By the time they snazz up the plastic shell with orange flames or colorful wheels, drivers can spend hundreds\u2014sometimes thousands\u2014of dollars, but it's still more affordable than the real deal. \u201cA lot of us would race real cars if we could, but this is a lot cheaper,\u201d says Tony Hinojosa, president of the Northern New Mexico Remote Control Car Club. \u201cYou can do it on a weekend warrior basis.\u201d Bacrania, who lives in Los Alamos, knew nothing about remote control cars until July 2016, when he stumbled on Hinojosa's maze-like dirt track at Overlook Park. He started chatting with a few drivers testing out their cars for an upcoming regional tournament, and they invited him to come back in a few weeks for Border Wars. The race pits drivers from New Mexico, Texas, and Colorado against each other on a 1/8 scale track for state bragging rights. Bacrania couldn't resist. \u201cYou could tell people were really passionate about what they were doing, and I like photographing people who are passionate,\u201d he says. About 100 people converged on the track over a three-day weekend in August for the race. They arrived as early as Thursday night, setting up RVs, trailers, and barbecue grills in the parking lot. On Friday morning, drivers tested and tweaked their cars, geeking out over engine temperatures, fuel necks, and tire tread. The parking lot transformed into a body shop. \"People wash their cars, clean them, baby them,\" Bacrania says. \"It\u2019s not a toy. It\u2019s like a regular car.\" Races began early on Saturday, classified according to the type of car (buggy or truck) and the driver's skill. Before the start of each race, the pit crew scurried out onto the track to position the cars and top off the tanks. Drivers controlled the cars from six feet up in a stand, trying to get more laps in a given amount of time than anyone else, a wire underground registering each pass. Marshalls stood out on the track during the race, ready to rescue any car that stalled out or flipped on a jump. The cars took a beating, but it was all worth it in the end for the prize: \u201cPride,\u201d Bacrania says. And a $2 styrofoam plaque. Bacrania\u2019s sun-drenched photographs capture the quirky intensity of the event and the love these people have for their cars. He shot them with a couple of Canon DSLRs, braving heat and sun and often crawling through the mud, trying his best not to get hit by one. He failed. But hey, the thing only weighed 10 pounds.

In the decades since, the number of patients requiring dialysis has increased fiftyfold. Today the federal government spends as much on treating kidney disease\u2014 nearly $31 billion per year \u2014as it does on the entire annual budget for the National Institutes of Health. The NIH devotes $574 million of its funding to kidney disease research to improve therapies and discover cures. It represents just 1.7 percent of the annual total cost of care for the condition. But Shuvo Roy , a professor in the School of Pharmacy at UC San Francisco, didn\u2019t know any of this back in the late 1990s when he was studying how to apply his electrical engineering chops to medical devices. Fresh off his PhD and starting a new job at the Cleveland Clinic, Roy was a hammer looking for interesting problems to solve. Cardiology and neurosurgery seemed like exciting, well-funded places to do that. So he started working on cardiac ultrasound. But one day, a few months in, an internal medicine resident at nearby Case Western Reserve University named William Fissell came up to Roy and asked: \u201cHave you ever thought about working on the kidney?\u201d Roy hadn\u2019t. But the more Fissell told him about how stagnant the field of kidney research had been, how ripe dialysis was for a technological overhaul, the more interested he got. And as he familiarized himself with the machines and the engineering behind them, Roy began to realize the extent of dialysis' limitations\u2014and the potential for innovation. Limitations like the pore-size problem. Dialysis does a decent job cleansing blood of waste products, but it also filters out good stuff: salts, sugars, amino acids. Blame the polymer manufacturing process, which can\u2019t replicate the 7-nanometer precision of nephrons\u2014the kidney's natural filters. Making dialysis membranes involves a process called extrusion, which yields a distribution of pore sizes\u2014most are about 7nm but you also get some portion that are much smaller, some that are much larger, and everything in between. This is a problem because that means some of the bad stuff (like urea and excess salts) can sneak through and some of the good stuff (necessary blood sugars and amino acids) gets trapped. Seven nanometers is the size of albumin\u2014a critical protein that keeps fluid from leaking out of blood vessels, nourishes tissues, and transports hormones, vitamins, drugs, and substances like calcium throughout the body. Taking too much of it out of the bloodstream would be a bad thing. And when it comes to the kidney\u2019s other natural functions, like secreting hormones that regulate blood pressure, dialysis can\u2019t do them at all. Only living cells can. \u201cWe were talking about making a better Bandaid,\u201d Roy says. But as he and Fissell looked around them at the advances being made in live tissue engineering, they started thinking beyond a better, smaller, faster filter. \u201cWe thought, if people are growing ears on the backs of mice, why can\u2019t we grow a kidney?\u201d It turned out, someone had already tried. Sort of. Dialysis, Disrupted Back in 1997 when Fissell and Roy were finishing up their advanced training at Case Western, a nephrologist named David Humes at the University of Michigan began working to isolate a particular kind of kidney cell found on the backend of the nephron. Humes figured out how to extract them from cadaver kidneys not suitable for transplant and grow them in his lab. Then he took those cells and coated the inside of hollow fibre-membrane filled tubes similar to the filter cartridge on modern dialysis machines. He had invented an artificial kidney that could live outside the human body on a continuous flow of blood from the patient and do more than just filter. The results were incredibly encouraging. In clinical trials at the University of Michigan Hospital, it improved the mortality rates for ICU patients with acute renal failure by half. There was just one problem. To work, the patient had to be permanently hooked up to half a hospital room\u2019s worth of tubes and pumps. The first time Roy saw Humes\u2019 set-up, he immediately recognized its promise\u2014and its limitations. Fissell had convinced him to drive from Cleveland to Ann Arbor in the middle of a snowstorm to check it out. The trip convinced them that the technology worked. It was just way too cumbersome for anyone to actually use it. The bioartificial kidney is a compact, surgically implanted, free-standing device to treat end stage renal disease (ESRD). It performs the vast majority of the biological functions of the natural kidney. Majed Abolfazli In 2000, Fissell joined Humes to do his nephrology fellowship at Michigan. Roy stayed at the Cleveland Clinic to work on cardiac medical devices. But for the next three years, nearly every Thursday afternoon Fissell hopped in his car and drove three hours east on I-90 to spend long weekends in Roy\u2019s lab tackling a quintessentially 21st century engineering problem: miniaturization. They had no money, and no employees. But they were able to ride the wave of advancements in silicon manufacturing that was shrinking screens and battery packs across the electronics industry. \u201cSilicon is the most perfected man-made material on Earth,\u201d Roy says from the entrance to the vacuum-sealed clean room at UCSF, where his grad students produce the filters. If they want to make a slit that\u2019s 7 nanometers wide, they can do that with silicon every time. It has a less than one percent variation rate. The silicon filters had another advantage, too. Because Roy and Fissell wanted to create a small implantable device, they needed a way to make sure there wasn\u2019t an immune response\u2014similar to transplant rejection. Stacks of silicon filters could act as a screen to keep the body\u2019s immune cells physically separated from Humes\u2019 kidney cells which would be embedded in a microscopic scaffold on the other side. The only thing getting through to them would be the salt and waste-filled water, which the cells would further concentrate into urine and route to the bladder. By 2007 the three researchers had made enough progress to apply for and receive a 3-year $3 million grant from the NIH to prove the concept of their implantable bioartificial kidney in an animal model. On the line was a second phase of funding, this time for $15 million, enough to take the project through human clinical trials. Roy moved out west to UCSF to be closer to the semiconductor manufacturing expertise in the Bay Area. Fissell worked on the project for a few more years at the Cleveland Clinic before being recruited to Vanderbilt while Humes stayed at the University of Michigan to keep working with his cells. But they didn\u2019t make the cut. And without money, the research began to stall. By then though, their kidney project had taken on a following of its own. Patients from all over the world wanted to see it succeed. And over the next few years they began donating to the project\u2014some sent in five dollar bills, others signed checks for a million dollars. One six-year-old girl from upstate New York whose brother is on dialysis convinced her mother to let her hold a roadside garden vegetable sale and send in the proceeds. The universities chipped in too, and the scientists started to make more progress. They used 3D printing to test new prototypes and computer models of hydraulic flow to optimize how all the parts would fit together. They began collaborating with the surgeons in their medical schools to figure out the best procedure for implanting the devices. By 2015 the NIH was interested again. They signed on to another $6 million over the next four years. And then the FDA got interested. That fall the agency selected the Kidney Project to participate in a new expedited regulatory approval plan intended to get medical innovations to patients faster. While Roy and Fissell have continued to tweak their device, helped along by weekly shipments of cryogenically frozen cells from Humes\u2019 lab, FDA officials have shepherded them through two years of preclinical testing, most of which has been done in pigs, and shown good results. In April, they sent 20 agency scientists out to California to advise on their next step: moving into humans. The plan is to start small\u2014maybe ten patients tops\u2014to test the safety of the silicon filter\u2019s materials. Clotting is the biggest concern, so they\u2019ll surgically implant the device in each participant\u2019s abdomen for a month to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. If that goes well they will do a follow-up study to make sure it actually filters blood in humans the way it\u2019s supposed to. Only then can they combine the filter with the bioreactor portion of the device, aka Humes\u2019 renal cells, to test the full capacity of the artificial kidney. The scientists expect to arrive at this final stage of clinical trials, and regulatory approval, by 2020. That may sound fast, but one thing they\u2019ve already got a jump on is patient recruiting. Nearly 9,000 of them have already signed up to the project\u2019s waitlist, ready to be contacted when clinical trials get the green light. These patients are willing to accept the risk of pioneering a third option, besides transplants, which are too expensive and too hard to get for most people, and the drudgery of dialysis. Joseph Vassalotti, a nephrologist in Manhattan and the Chief Medical Officer for the National Kidney Foundation says \u201cthe more choices patients have the better,\u201d even though he\u2019s skeptical the device will become a reality within the next few years. An implantable kidney would dramatically improve their quality of life and be a welcome innovation after so many years of treatment status quo. \u201cDuring World War II we didn\u2019t think dialysis would be possible,\u201d Vassalotti says. \u201cNow half a million Americans are being treated with it. It\u2019s amazing the progress just a few decades makes.\u201d 1 Correction: 12:50pm ET The Kidney Project is now slated to begin clinical trials in early 2018. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated they would take place later this year. Changes have also been made to correctly identify the size and timing of grants to the Kidney Project.

This is a man who, based on his public appearances, lives in suits worth more than your car. He is, after all, the CEO of Lamborghini. Any element of his appearance that doesn\u2019t live up to the combination of wealth, style, and Italian-ness that his company represents would be an offense. Today he's wearing the suit, but has left the collar of his perfectly pressed shirt unbuttoned. He isn't wearing a tie. He chose the casual look, he says, out of deference to the aggressively lenient sartorial sense of Silicon Valley. Domenicali is here on a fact-finding mission. He has come to explore the future of artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. Of all the automakers on the planet, Lamborghini may have the least to gain from a world in which robots do all the driving, where ground transportation becomes more commodified good than personalized experience. After all, the company has built its brand on cars that are thrilling to drive. You can\u2019t get chills from 740 horsepower and a naturally aspirated V-12 engine if you hand control over to some bore of a robot. \u201cThe more everyone is pushing this kind of technology, the more we need to be different,\u201d Domenicali says. \u201cOur customer wants hands-on, fun to drive, to be at the center of this emotional experience.\u201d The CEO has crossed an ocean and a continent not to destroy the robots but to embrace them. He\u2019s hanging out at Stanford University\u2014a hub of self-driving research\u2014and scoping startups because he sees an opportunity. Being different doesn\u2019t mean ignoring technological advances. It means applying them to further Lamborghini\u2019s not quite openly stated mission: making rich people feel awesome. Sure, nobody needs 740 horsepower. But Lamborghini's real problem is that very few people know how to wield it. The confident crash (and crash , and crash , and crash ). The cautious never experience the frisson for which they\u2019ve paid hundreds of thousands of dollars. Lamborghini thinks artificial intelligence could help here, using the computer to keep the driver safe while showing her where she can push the gas pedal farther, shift gears sooner, make the turn sharper. \u201cYou can give a threshold where you can use the car, starting to have fun, but in a condition that you\u2019ll never be scared,\u201d says Lambo chief engineer Maurizio Reggiani. \u201cThis can be a tool for our customers, like having a tutor.\u201d The practical bits of this idea\u2014when it might happen, what it would look like, how much it would cost\u2014remain in the foggy future. Lamborghini\u2019s still on a scouting mission. And it\u2019s not the only company eyeing this sort of advance. McLaren, a rival in the supercar world, has similar ideas about how artificial intelligence and autonomous driving capability could attract buyers. \u201cThe car basically takes you around the track at the right speed, the right RPMs, the right gears, the right line, and you learn through the car showing you the best way,\u201d design director Frank Stephenson imagined in an interview with Blackbird . \u201cThen you can take over on the next few laps, and if you make a mistake, the car can intervene.\u201d Toyota's bosses say they're less interested in fully autonomous vehicles than in what they call \u201cguardian angel\u201d tech , where the human does the driving but the robot can take control when a crash is imminent. And just this week, Mitsubishi hopped onto the bandwagon. Its awkwardly named e-Evolution concept won\u2019t just run on electric power, the automaker explained in a press release. It will offer an artificial intelligence system designed to teach humans how to be better drivers\u2014evaluating their skills and offering advice for improvement. Again, the details are hazy at best. These are all concepts from automakers eager to prove they\u2019re ready for a changing world. But maybe the robots aren\u2019t all intent on taking our place at the wheel. Maybe they\u2019ll help us navigate, offering sage advice for the road ahead. Accelerate harder. Brake later.

Hard to believe, I know, but it's true. During that time, I thought about teenager things. In particular, I recall thinking about and wanting a super fast car. Maybe a Lamborghini or a Ferrari. At lunch my friends and I would argue about the best cars (THE BEST), and what we wouldn't give to drive them. Today I drive a minivan. Nothing wrong with that. Now that I'm older, I care more about fuel efficiency and safety than speed. But there's this video of the Bugatti Chiron, see. It's one of the quickest production cars ever made . In the video, it starts from rest, accelerates to 400 kilometers per hour (nearly 250 miles per hour), and decelerates to zero in just shy of 42 seconds. Talk about super fast. Too fast, probably. I'm not sure I'd even want to drive a car that fast. But the video is still thrilling. Plus: It includes speed and distance data. Of course I can also get time data by assuming the video frame rate is legitimate. So the point is there's basically zero chance of me not doing a speed analysis of this thing. Velocity Vs. Time For this first plot, I am just going to use the velocity data. There are actually two methods to get the velocity of the car in some of the frames. First, there is the text-based reading on the lower left of the screen. Second, there is the view of the speedometer. There are still some parts of the video in which you can see neither of these values\u2014so for those times, I just don't know the velocity. However, I can still plot what I have. Here is what I get. Since the acceleration is defined as the change in velocity divided by the change in time, the slope of a velocity-time graph will be the acceleration of the car. Notice that I have fit four linear functions to the data (I included the fitting equation for one of these linear fits). An accelerating car doesn't necessarily need to have a constant acceleration, but it looks like in this case the motion can indeed be approximated by these four segments. OK, you could argue that there should be five acceleration segments because of the stopping part\u2014if you want to do that, feel free to use more accelerations. From the slope, I get the following four accelerations (along with the approximate times of these intervals). 9.68 m/s 2 from t = 0 to 5.12 seconds 3.9 m/s 2 from t = 5.12 to 13.32 seconds 1.556 m/s 2 from t = 13.32 to 33.24 seconds -13.5 m/s 2 from t = 33.24 to 41.8 seconds I plan to use these accelerations in another calculation, but right away I see some interesting things. It's not surprising that the final acceleration (before the braking) is so low. When the car is traveling super fast, the air resistance is going to be much greater, such that it takes more power to increase the speed. For the braking acceleration, we normally think of the maximum acceleration as 9.8 m/s 2 . Why? Because the force that slows the car down is the static friction force. This force is proportional to the weight of the car (for a flat road). The proportionality constant is called the coefficient of static friction and normally has a value between 0 and 1 . These must be some sticky tires. Position Vs. Time Since the video also gives a reading of the total distance traveled, I will also make a graph. Yes. I wrote down these distance values for different time intervals in the video (but not all the values\u2014just a select few). Here is my plot. Now for the fun part. Can I take the acceleration data from above and calculate the position at different times? Yes, of course I can. However, will it match up to this position data? Let's find out. But how do you calculate position from the acceleration? Suppose a car starts from rest (as it does) and has an acceleration of a 1 . If it accelerates for a time \u0394t 1 , then I can calculate both the position and velocity at the end of this time interval using the following kinematic equations. In these equations, the \"zero\" subscripts represent values at the start of the time interval and the \"one\" subscripts are at the end of the interval. This means that v 1 is the velocity after this time interval. Since the starting velocity is zero m/s and the starting position is zero meters, this is pretty easy. After a time interval of 5.12 seconds, the car should have traveled 126.9 meters with an ending speed of 49.56 m/s. What about at the end of the second acceleration? In that case, I just do the same thing using the same equations. However, the starting velocity and starting position for the second acceleration phase will be the final velocity and position from the first part. They just sort of chain together. I can keep doing this for all the intervals. Here's what I get along with a comparison from the position data on the video. OK, I'm pretty happy with that. The calculated line doesn't match the listed position data exactly\u2014but that's not so bad. Remember that I am approximating constant acceleration over these four time intervals. Clearly, the car doesn't exactly have a constant acceleration. Finally, let me leave you with just one homework assignment. See if you can create the same (or at least very similar) position vs. time graph for the car based on just the velocity data (and not the acceleration). Here's a hint to get you started: Take two velocities at two different times and find out how far the car traveled during this time. Then keep adding these distances and you will be finished. If you want to make an approximation, you could probably assume constant velocity for very short time intervals; your answer shouldn't be too far off. But wait! Do you need EVEN MORE homework? You probably do. Here is yet another super fast car\u2014the Koenigsegg Agera RS . It appears to get to 400 km/h and back to zero in just 36.44 seconds. The video doesn't include position data like the Bugatti video, but it does display a nice graph of velocity vs. time. Just for fun, see if you can use that data to create a plot of position vs. time for the Agera RS just like I did with the Bugatti.

Scott\u2019s film is full of female characters who are all replicants, yet their literal objectification is barely explored; East Asian aesthetics pervade its vision of dystopian LA, yet Asian characters are largely background players; its cyborgs are meant to be stand-ins for oppressed minority groups, but few, if any, minorities are actually present on screen. These shortcomings have become so apparent in the decades since the film's release that Blade Runner has become a shorthand for exploring those topics, even if only to show how sci-fi stories like it can succeed or fail at addressing them. So when word of a sequel arose, the question immediately became whether or not it would update its view of humanity along with its view of the future. The answer to that question, unfortunately, is: not so much . ( Spoiler alert: Minor spoilers for Blade Runner 2049 follow.) Director Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Blade Runner 2049 is certainly as obsessed with the eroding distinction between human and artificial life as Scott\u2019s film was. Its production design\u2014in 2049, Los Angeles is so overpopulated it looks more like a server farm than an actual human habitat\u2014is just as breathtaking as the original\u2019s. And its technological advances, like the tiny hover-pods that allow Tyrell\u2019s successor Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) to see or the new biologically engineered replicants grown in Matrix -like cocoons, are executed in a way that propels the franchise 30 years into the future. Yet for all the attention paid to updating the sequel\u2019s physical details, its three-hour plot does little to concern itself with anything beyond the depths of its white male protagonists, reducing white women to tired archetypes and utterly sidelining nonwhite characters. When word of a Blade Runner sequel arose, the question immediately became whether or not it would update its view of humanity along with its view of the future. The answer to that question, unfortunately, is: not so much . Ford\u2019s reprised Deckard and Ryan Gosling\u2019s blade runner K both have complex inner lives behind their macho reticence. K, like Deckard, doesn't think critically about his job or the replicants he executes. His demeanor remains a mask for the audience to endlessly consider in long, uncut close-up\u2014until a revelation forces him to question his identity, and his world falls apart repeatedly across his face. Deckard describes the heart-wrenching motivations for his self-exile and the agony that has accompanied it; Leto\u2019s Wallace monologues at length about his megalomaniacal ambitions to play god to a species that can overrun humankind. Each man gets a story, and each story gets an airing. Despite their unrelentingly pedestrian Psych 101 woes, these three men still manage to take up 95 percent of the emotional frame on screen, leaving little room for the women around them to have their own narratives. There\u2019s manic pixie dream girlfriend Joi (Ana de Armas), whom K has literally purchased, \u00e0 la Her . K\u2019s boss, Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright), berates him at work and then invites herself over, drinks his alcohol, and comes on to him. Mariette (Mackenzie Davis), the sex worker with a heart of gold, repeatedly comes to K\u2019s aid (in every way you can imagine). Wallace\u2019s servant Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) has the most tangible personality, yet she\u2019s obsessed with pleasing Wallace. Even Sean Young\u2019s Rachael makes a cameo as a plot device for Deckard, embodying the final archetype\u2014the martyred Madonna\u2014of this Ultimate Sexist Megazord. Three female characters, not one one of them voicing an ambition or desire that does not pertain to their male counterparts. Just because 2049 \u2019s future has females doesn\u2019t mean its future is female . Yet in a deeply ironic twist, the plot itself hinges entirely on their presence; without women, be they human or replicant, the secret K discovers that sends him on his harrowing mission wouldn\u2019t exist. If Villeneuve and screenwriters Hampton Fancher and Michael Green recognized this, they must have ultimately decided they could accomplish the same goals without having to imbue those critical female characters with the same humanity as their male counterparts. (After all, when a character\u2019s function is more plot point than passion, why bother giving it stage directions?) Several moments almost comment meaningfully on women\u2019s disposability\u2014Wallace\u2019s casual gutting of a newborn female replicant; a giant, naked Joi addressing K blankly from an ad\u2014yet each time, they become sad moments in a man\u2019s narrative, rather than being recognized as tragedies for the women themselves. Unsurprisingly, the problem worsens when viewed through a racial lens. Gaff (Edward James Olmos, now in a retirement home), a lab tech (played by Wood Harris), and two shady black-market dealers are the only men of color with more than one line; none have identities beyond their use to K. The only visible woman of color is one of Mariette\u2019s nameless coworkers. (While de Armas was born in Cuba, her grandparents are European.) The third act finally delivers a plot twist that insists the story is not actually about K and Deckard\u2014except the action continues to focus on them anyway. As critic Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n recently noted at Vulture, mainstream dystopian sci-fi has always been obsessed with oppression narratives. While it returns over and over again to the downtrodden-rises-up-against-the-subjugator model, the genre has always had a remarkable ability to overlook the persecuted groups\u2014people of color, women, the LGBTQ community, people with disabilities\u2014whose experiences it mines for drama. White creators, men in particular, tend instead to whitewash their casts, imagining themselves as both villain and hero. Rather than simply putting the real thing in the story, their tales become metaphors for the real thing. Blade Runner 2049 falls into this trap: Even as Wallace grandstands about \"great societies\" being \"built on the backs of a disposable workforce,\" everyone the movie deems powerful or worth exploring is still white and almost 100 percent male, relegating those disposable workforces\u2019 descendants to the story\u2019s incidental margins. This was one of countless missed opportunities Blade Runner 2049 had to transform the franchise into not just a staggering aesthetic and technological achievement but also an incisive read of 21st century society. In the wake of Mad Max \u2019s recent overhaul\u2014which, while imperfect, managed to redeem many of its predecessors\u2019 flaws \u2014this misstep is especially disappointing. Yet like Deckard\u2019s hurried brush-off of Rachael\u2019s honest question in 2019, 2049 \u2019s filmmakers have attempted to tell a story about personhood in 2017 without actually considering the urgent politics that surround who gets to be a person in 2017. And in an era that begs for this kind of reinvention, its failure flattens its message into one more retirement for the books.

On the surface, Envelop is just a room with a kickass surround sound system. Eight stacks of speakers are arranged along the walls, four towers on each side with four speakers inside each tower situated at different heights. There are also subwoofers in the corners and speakers in the ceiling. When the DJ cranks up a mellow dance track mixed especially for this system, sound waves rain down from above you, creep up from below you, spin around your head, and smother you in audio. Envelop is a place designed for listening to music in a fully immersive, 360-degree environment. It's inside a larger arts complex called The Midway . They host events there, like yoga classes, ambient music performances, and EDM dance gatherings. There are listening parties coming up for Dark Side of the Moon and Geinoh Yamashirogumi's Akira Symphonic Suite . But Envelop is bigger than just a room full of speakers used for throwing events. The group of artists who created Envelop also built the software tools to run it all. They've released their own plugin for the music creation app Ableton Live that lets musicians mix their songs not just in stereo, but all around the listener, in a full sphere. Any multi-speaker array can play back tracks mixed for Envelop, turning just about any room into a fully immersive audio playground. Round and Around Among sound designers, this technique of mixing in three dimensions is called ambisonics, or spatial audio. \"For years we've been listening to stereo, and that's incredible,\" says Envelop's executive director Christopher Willits. \"However it's not composed to be moving around an audience. It's really just coming at you from one direction. So spatial audio allows a composer to use space as another part of that music. It allows an audience to have a shared experience of the sound. It's very similar to the way that we experience sound every day, which is in three dimensions all around us.\" Spatial audio and ambisonics (the terms are interchangeable, at least outside of Reddit forums) have been around for a long time. You've watched a movie in multi-channel surround sound. You might even remember quadraphonic mixes of Santana and Isley Brothers LPs in the 1970s. But while those technologies can throw sound around a room in a horizontal plane, spatial audio involves mixing sound in a full sphere. That's trickier, and many of the tools currently available for creating spatial audio cost a pretty penny, or they're designed to only work with a specific company's microphones or mixing stations. There are, however, some great open-source software tools out there. Envelop is throwing itself in with that camp. The free Envelop plug-in currently works in Ableton Live, but Willits and his cohorts hope to develop code that works with other apps. Willits says it's always been the core intention of the Envelop project to be open source and available to everyone. \"We feel the idea of spatial audio has been wrapped up in a lot of proprietary methods, and that has withheld the ability for artists to afford the tools needed to create it. It's also kept the audience from experiencing the added value that spatial audio gives people.\" Music of the Spheres Added value indeed. Being in the audience for a spatial audio performance is really wild. Envelop at the Midway has 32 speakers around the room, and when you stand in the middle\u2014or anywhere, really\u2014you can feel sound filling the whole space. Drums spin around you, low drone notes buzz behind you, and high-frequency effects fizz and bubble on all sides. It's truly far out. Christopher is a well-respected composer and musician . He makes his own ambient electronic music, and he played a few of his tracks for me over Envelop's system. Walking around the room while the songs were playing, it didn't really sound like music was coming from the speakers around me. The music was just... part of the room. \"Our software allows the composer to take any sound and place it within a virtual sphere,\" Willits says, \"and that virtual sphere can then be decoded to a physical environment with X number of channels.\" You don't need 32 speakers to listen to a performance created with Envelop. The system is designed to plug into any speaker array, whether you've got 150 speaker bins in a huge room, or just a pair of headphones. Envelop is infinitely scalable. They group is trying to get venues to adopt the Envelop platform and install the equipment necessary to host their own ambisonic happenings. Because what good is a crazy spatial audio freakout without a proper room to hear it in? And of course, spatial audio is a big component of VR and 360 video. Musicians and sound designers could even use Envelop to make an ambisonic mix for a VR experience that could be played back in a pair of headphones, or in a big room with a dozen speakers. So, imagine a space like Envelop filled with people who aren't dancing or doing yoga, but wearing VR headsets. If you want to hear Envelop in person, there are a number of events planned for the coming months. Christopher Willits is playing a concert at the space on November 18. Yoga classes with a 360-degree sound component are held every other Tuesday. If you're an electronic musician, mark November 16 on your calendar; the space is hosting a tutorial on using the Envelop plug-in for Ableton Live.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T18:10:37.780+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0bdeeb661e787210b3b5db38241c607f2013b584", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjIDkAGY.Jp7SY89oIarVmHHQ2UGhjqZAbeB7rLeQZnedxo5OZrk6_bHlKI8JWeJ4-", "site_full": "www.wired.com", "site": "wired.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.wired.com/wired/index", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Feed: All Latest", "title": "GM and Ford Promise Electric Cars, Uber and Waymo Go to Court, and More Car News From This Week", "title_full": "GM and Ford Promise Electric Cars, Uber and Waymo Go to Court, and More Car News From This Week", "published": "2017-10-06T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/594a8eaa04e32e574f51f948/191:100/pass/Uber-Taxi_HP_AP_17087367471010.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 859, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 119, "comments": 0, "shares": 119}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 29}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0bdeeb661e787210b3b5db38241c607f2013b584", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjIDkAGY.Jp7SY89oIarVmHHQ2UGhjqZAbeB7rLeQZnedxo5OZrk6_bHlKI8JWeJ4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aarian Marshall", "published": "2017-10-06T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "GM and Ford Promise Electric Cars, Uber and Waymo Go to Court, and More Car News From This Week", "text": "This Week in the Future of Cars: Things Just Got Serious AP Welcome to October: It\u2019s all getting real.

You could place an empty box on the street, walk away, and hope there\u2019s food inside when you return. The likely result? Your box will be filled with trash. WIRED OPINION ABOUT Andrew Losowsky ( @losowsky ) is project lead of Mozilla\u2019s Coral Project. The Coral Project builds open-source tools and guides to community practice to bring journalists closer to the communities they serve. Alternatively, you could think strategically. Where should you put the box? Outside a grocery store, perhaps. How will people know what to put in the box? You can write, \u201cDonations for Food Bank,\u201d on the side. You can also stand near the box, so that if people throw trash inside, you can remove it quickly. And when people put tins of food inside, you can make them visible, so others know what to buy inside the store. Right now, many publishers are placing an empty box at the bottom of their stories and walking away. And then they\u2019re frustrated, maybe even disgusted, at the trash that collects there. Abuse, trolling, harassment, racism, misogyny\u2014these are all real problems down in the comments, and they\u2019re a symptom of wider problems: societal, yes, but also strategic. The current process goes like this: Journalist writes an article. Article is published. People write comments. Journalist peeks at the comments, and sees a lot of meanness and abuse (especially if they\u2019re a woman, a person of color, or especially a woman of color). Journalist vows not to engage with such horrid readers. The organization listens to its journalists when they say that comments are worthless and puts fewer resources into them. The comments then get worse due to lack of engagement and strategy, leaving the space to a small number of argumentative types corralled by a tiny battled-hardened community team. A few sites have nixed comments completely, saying that the conversation is now better had elsewhere. \u201cWe encourage our audience to continue to interact with us [on social media],\u201d said Al Jazeera English when it removed comments last month. If a site chooses not to dedicate resources to community management, then closing the comments is probably the best option. However, this is a dangerous and short-sighted position for the news industry to adopt. It\u2019s damaging not only to the bottom line, but also to the future of journalism as an industry. Let\u2019s start with three of the key metrics that advertisers care about: number of views, time spent on a page, and the loyalty of the audience. Who spends the most time on the page? People reading comments after the article and engaging in the discussion. Who creates multiple page views? Commenters who return to reply to conversations they\u2019re involved in. Who are the most loyal audience members? Almost certainly your commenters. Earlier this year, The Financial Times found that its commenters are seven times more engaged than the rest of its readers. The Times of London revealed recently that the 4 percent of its readers who comment are by far its most valuable. \u201cYou can see the benefits in terms of engaging readers and renewing subscriptions,\u201d Ben Whitelaw, head of audience development at the Times and The Sunday Times , told the online news site Digiday. When an organization moves these communities onto Facebook, it is handing over everything to the big blue thumb: all of the readers\u2019 data, the control of the moderation tools, control of the advertising, even the opportunity to manage subscriptions \u2014 and all in a place where people are more likely to comment without even opening the article. (Not to mention that Facebook has hardly solved its own abuse problem.) RELATED STORIES 6 Experts on How Silicon Valley Can Solve Online Harassment Yes, some community members can be demanding, argumentative, aggressive, mean. But others can be helpful. David Fahrenthold won a Pulitzer Prize for his investigations into Donald Trump; his readers helped him uncover various pieces of information, including the location of a painting of the now-president that he bought for himself at a charity auction. Comments are where many people share personal anecdotes related to a news story, and where experts sometimes share links to their research. Sometimes, the community can be supportive and meaningful for its members: for example, a commenter on the Carolyn Hax advice blog at The Washington Post was so beloved that the newspaper wrote a piece about her after she died. Memorials to her writing were then left, yes, in the comments. Commenters can even become potential hires: The Atlantic \u2019s current politics editor, Yoni Appelbaum, was plucked from the comments section. It\u2019s easy to forget that behind the anonymous usernames are real people with something to say. There are many examples of sites that recognize the value of these communities. The Washington Post \u2019s Capital Weather Gang has a thriving and supportive community that provides tips and information to its journalists. The Guardian \u2019s live blogs thrive on their interaction with the comments, and its Crossword community is second to none. Community sites such as Metafilter continue to have robust communities around the news. The founder of subscriber-only site The Information, Jessica Lessin, has described its comment community as \u201cone of the most powerful parts of the site.\u201d Right now, many news sites with comments spend their resources policing the actions of a small minority of people. Those organizations need to shift the focus from merely removing the negative to building positive, flexible community spaces, where a small, antisocial subset are no longer able to dominate the space or abuse the people within it with impunity. Every site needs to be thinking about more than just improving comments, Publishers should also be more clear about what the goals of the space are, and should try to build strong digital communities that members are actively involved in managing. If more comments sections become places where people actually talk to each other\u2014and to the person who wrote the story\u2014they will encourage ideas and empathy, not insults. Potential sources and new story ideas will emerge. We can achieve this through better technology and more flexible tools, and by hiring people who have actually suffered harassment to help build the solutions. Those tools should make it easy to highlight the best parts of the conversation and for journalists to engage without making themselves vulnerable to abuse. At Coral, where I work, we have two open source tools that are being adopted by newsrooms. Ask collects reader submissions and displays them back to readers.

(It\u2019s used by the Washington Post , the Brisbane Times , and Estadao in Brazil.) There are many other tools out there, such as Hearken\u2014used by the BBC\u2014and GroundSource, used by ProPublica and the Texas Tribune . They offer other ways for journalists and communities to interact earlier and more frequently in the reporting process. There is no single approach or tool that will work everywhere. The best community strategies are adaptable. For example: If a topic is unlikely to spur thoughtful discussion in a comment section, the editors should consider other kinds of engagement\u2014such as a form to submit stories and experiences that can help future reporting. The comment space is just one tool for interaction and discussion, and it can be a highly effective one. But only if organizations are more thoughtful about where, how, and why they use the box.

He also, though, happily shares his account with at least one staffer. So how do we know when the most-mad-online president in human history is actually tapping out his own material? Fortunately for us, Trump is a creature of habit, and he's got some tells. In the early days, all it took to figure out whether a tweet came from Trump himself was to peek at the source device. (You can check easily in TweetDeck.) If the tweet came from an Android phone, Trump's own fingers almost certainly tapped it out, since the rest of his staff used iPhones. After assuming the office of the presidency, though, Trump had to replace his Android with a specially designed iPhone that contains the Twitter app and little else . In addition to almost guaranteeing our eventual total annihilation by allowing Trump's Twitter habit to continue, the device switch means we have to look for other ways to figure out when the tweets come straight from Trump. This proved particularly challenging during version one of the Trump administration, when press secretary Sean Spicer, chief of staff Reince Priebus, and alt-right interpreter Steve Bannon all had yet to be ousted. Along with advisor Kellyanne Conway, they all likely took a spin on Trump's Twitter account at some point. Now, though, with Trump's more trusted advisors working on the outside and White House chief of staff John Kelly trying to minimize chaos, we can have relative confidence that each Trump tweet goes one of two ways: Either he wrote it, or caddy-turned-White-House-social-media director Dan Scavino did. Scavino and Trump likely aren't the only people with direct access to the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account. (It would make sense for White House communications director Hope Hicks, for instance, to have a log-in for emergency deletion purposes.) But those are the only two people we definitively know to tweet from the account. A Scavino profile in Politico in June noted that he has Trump's voice nailed, and is \"constantly recording content for online videos.\" Fortunately, thanks to a constant stream of palace intrigue stories and an unhealthy level of observation, it's not too hard to figure out who's who. Want to know when a tweet's not from Trump himself? Follow these tells. There's More Than Just Text Though he may be adept (enough) at Twitter, Trump isn't known for being tech savvy. About two years ago, The New York Times noted that Trump \"has no computer in his office (a staff member brings in a laptop to show him videos) and asks aides to print his emails for consumption the old-fashioned way.\" This means that any time you see an image or video attached to one of Trump's tweets, our good friend Dan was almost certainly the mastermind . It's not just multimedia, though\u2014pretty much anything requiring more than an @-symbol puts the tweet firmly in Scavino territory. The social media director's recent slip-up, in which he accidentally tweeted from his account instead of Trump's, would seem to confirm as much. Note the hashtag usage. Did Donald do the tweet? If the tweet consists of nothing but words and the occasional @-mention, Donald Trump probably did the tweet. It's Not 6 AM About a month before election day, The New York Times revealed that Trump generally dictated tweets to his assistants during the work day, but would send out his own missives during down time. According to a different report from Trump's first weeks in the White House, at around 6:30 pm he generally heads back to the residence to mainline cable news until sometime after midnight. So it's relatively safe to assume that any text-only tweets coming out of @realDonaldTrump in the evening (assuming, of course, he's not off at a rally) were typed by the man himself. The morning, however, is when Donald Trump truly shines. Usually up by around 6 am ET or so, the president can often get a good three or four hours of Fox News under his belt before he has to go pretend to listen to the daily intelligence briefing at 10.

Jerry Melillo of the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Mass., and colleagues began the study in 1991. Audrey Barker-Plotkin Tucked into the apple-growing hills of Western Massachusetts is the Harvard Forest, a 3,700-acre wooded preserve that hosts school kids on field trips, day-tripping hikers, and, for more than a quarter century, a highly unusual science experiment. For the past 26 years, strings of subterranean electrical wires have heated segments of the forest floor to an unnatural temperature. It's the longest running experiment of its kind, and a time machine of sorts\u2014a way for ecologists to study how the soil will respond to changes in global temperatures, which are projected to rise an estimated 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century. The world\u2019s soils are important because they contain two to three times more carbon than the atmosphere. Now, results from this experiment have shown that rising temperatures could cause the soil to release that carbon, accelerating global warming in a reinforcing feedback loop. But before we get to that, a quick explainer: Plants take in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Bacteria and fungi release it as they break down dead leaves, branches, and other materials that fall to the ground. As the microbes warm up, they break down material faster, which in turn releases more CO 2 into the atmosphere. Scientists at the Marine Biological Laboratory strung electric wires underneath a forest in Massachusetts in a 26-year experiment to see what might happen at the end of this century. Eric Niiler Other scientists have described this carbon-soil feedback loop in recent years. But how much carbon will be released by century\u2019s end, and how fast will it get into the air? These are questions ecologist Jerry Melillo set out to answer when he designed the Harvard Forest experiment in 1991. The idea had come to him months earlier, while driving to a conference in Sweden. He noticed that the normally snow-covered roads were ice-free. \u201cThese roads are quite amazing,\u201d Melillo says. \u201cI found out during the winter they would electrify them. I realized it might be a technology we could use.\u201d So Melillo picked up some underground road cables in Sweden and brought them to the Harvard Forest. He buried the cables in six test sites, with another six sites serving as untouched controls. Then the researchers warmed the soil a toasty 5 degrees Celsius (about 9 degrees Fahrenheit) above the ambient temperature and installed special devices to measure soil gases. For the next 26 years, dozens of scientists, doctoral students, and undergraduates recorded how much carbon dioxide was released. Their results, published this week in the journal Science , reveal a surprising four-phase pattern. First there was a period of substantial carbon loss (1991 to 2000), followed by several years of stability (2001 to 2007), then another period of loss (2008-2013), with more stability since 2014. Melillo says these phases suggest microbes in the soil are \u201creorganizing\" their genetic material to adapt to the changing soil temperatures. Using DNA and RNA sequencing tools, the researchers have been able to identify what kinds of microbes are at work and how they are consuming various \u201cstocks\u201d of carbon in the soil. But in the past 26 years, the soil in the heated plots has lost 17 percent of its carbon.

For Years, For Millions, You Were the Internet Axel Heimken/AP The best preservation of my middle- and high-school years doesn't exist in a yearbook or in a diary. All you need to know about me, between the ages of 12 and 17, you could find in my AIM chat logs. AOL \u2014or Oath, or Verizon, or whatever the messy conglomerate of failed internet companies turned confusing advertising businesses is called now\u2014announced today that it'll be shutting down AOL Instant Messenger for good on December 15, 2017. Frankly the news is a long time coming: AIM's been a ghost town for a decade, long since replaced by Facebook and WhatsApp and Skype and Snapchat and an entire generation of social products that evidently nobody at AOL ever saw coming or understood how to compete with. It's easy to forget now, but for a brief moment at the turn of the century no internet company was cooler than AOL. But my parents wouldn't pay for AOL, no matter how often I made the financial case for our improved internet access and the emotional lift of that \"You've got mail!\" clip. I had an email @optonline.net, and lived outside the walled garden while all my friends partied inside. Whether you were a banker on Wall Street or a pimply middle schooler, you were on AIM. It was the best messaging app, the only one that mattered. But then AIM happened. Originally a skunkworks project within AOL, the messenger almost wasn't released, and even then shouldn't have been so successful. But it quickly became undeniable: whether you were a banker on Wall Street or a pimply middle schooler, you were on AIM. It was the best messaging app, the only one that mattered. Suddenly, though I still couldn't browse AOL's hyper colored version of the internet, I could chat with my friends. And everyone, I mean everyone, was on AIM. Every day I'd come home from school, plop down at the family computer in the den, log on as davep3355, and immediately resume conversation with everyone I'd just left at the bus stop. For all we like to worry about how much of life happens on the internet now, a lot of life happened on AIM. Friendships and relationships started, ended, and often took place mostly in a chat window. It always started the same way: one person waiting for the other's name to pop up on their Buddy List, then trying to wait at least a few seconds before chatting them so as not to seem desperate. Long before group texts, we planned life on AIM. AIM to Please The longer you were on AIM, the more you began to understand the platform's native conventions. We all learned that our away messages, which showed up near our names on friends' buddy lists when we were technically online but not at the computer (back when that wasn't the way all things were all the time), conformed to their own code. A particularly angsty song lyric, ideally a line or two from a Dashboard Confessional track, was a cry for help and comfort. Unless you overused the tactic, in which case, ugh, the drama. AIM was a precursor to the modern social internet in so many ways. Custom Buddy Icons were the proto-profile picture. Colorful, ASCII art-rich profiles were the original MySpace page. AIM did voice chat before Skype, file-sharing before Dropbox. Any sufficiently sophisticated AIM user remembers SmarterChild , the dour, bizarre chatbot that would help you answer basic questions or debate the fate of the universe. AIM taught an entire generation of users a particular version of internet-speak. \"AFK\" meant away from keyboard, a useful status update long before real-time presence indicators. \"POS\" meant Parent Over Shoulder, a secret code letting your buddy know not to say anything crazy. AIM taught me how to LOL, and the subtle difference between ROFL and ROFLMAO. I was always brb-ing, and always jk'ing. Even now, there are features AIM figured out that nobody else has successfully replicated. If someone was trolling you or being offensive on AIM, you had real power: a \"warn\" button that would actually slow down the internet connection of the person on the other side before eventually cutting them off. It's odd, too, that away messages have disappeared: in a world where we'd all like to be a little less connected, a way to say \"I'm here but not really\" couldn't be more useful. None of this is to say you should still be using AIM, or that AOL shouldn't be killing it. AIM outlived its usefulness a long time ago, ruined by apparent corporate in-fighting and the same lack of vision that doomed AOL as a whole. But as AIM marches toward its final resting place, on the Buddy List in the sky, and an entire generation Googles \"how to download your AIM logs,\" just remember for a moment how great it was when everyone used the same messaging app, when it gave us everything we needed, and when logging on to the internet was a joyful moment rather than a bracing one.

Typically, female friendships have been nearly nonexistent in gaming, and, when present, exist on the periphery\u2014confined to character descriptions or backstory exposition, telling players rather than showing them. Thanks to recent game from developers like Naughty Dog and Deck Nine Games, though, some of 2017\u2019s biggest games have foregrounded the primacy of women's friendships in gaming. These studios have created situations that not only model the types of adventures and interactions I aspire to have in my own life, but broaden the narrative scope of gaming as a whole. Recently, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy swapped out the franchise\u2019s treasure-hunting frontman, Nathan Drake, for two of its prominent female characters: roguish Chloe Frazer (voiced by Claudia Black), and former mercenary Nadine Ross (Laura Bailey), originally seen in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End . The change resonated with fans , much to Naughty Dog\u2019s delight. But why Chloe, and why weave a tale of a strong relationship between two women rather than the raucous \u201cbuddy cop\u201d adventures portrayed in the previous Uncharted games? \"She was a very mysterious character. People really liked her, but no one really knew about her,\" says Shaun Escayg, The Lost Legacy \u2019s creative director. \u201cWe couldn't tell which side she was on.\u201d There was also an element of surprise: Chloe she wasn't exactly someone that seemed ready to let anyone in. The game\u2019s writers paired Chloe with Nadine as a classic moral yin-yang. \"Nadine is by the book,\u201d says Escayg, \u201cand Chloe is this hustler and thief. They're sort of opposites with similarities that hold them together, bonding them.\u201d It\u2019s a relationship that could apply to any two women, and one I found myself relating to more and more as Nadine and I journeyed together through the game. I tend to be the sardonic, deadpan half of any pair, and can be quick to retreat behind a hardened facade if things aren\u2019t going my way. In the past (and, frankly, even now) I found it hard to be anything other than bulletproof, but seeing Chloe open up to Nadine in the smallest of ways gave me flashbacks to friendships I now wish I had spent more time incubating. There's one in-game exchange between Chloe and Nadine that feels all too familiar\u2014a conversation I've tried to have with other women working in games writing. \"Look, for what it's worth, it's your kick-ass reputation that got you this job,\" Chloe says to Nadine. As someone who struggles to be more eloquent and honest in my admiration of other strong women without coming off as though I'm fangirling, I can almost hear the blush creeping to her cheeks. \"Plus, I figured you could use the money,\" she adds quietly to inject a little humor. \"You're not wrong,\" Nadine scoffs, clearly beginning warmed to her new partner. \"Honestly, though, it's actually nice working with a woman for a change.\" \"Not many of us out here,\" Nadine concurred. Truer words , I think to myself. This kind of banter is unique for the Uncharted franchise as a whole; the only real interactions between Chloe with another woman up until The Lost Legacy usually revolved around Nathan Drake, or seeing Elena as competition, so it's doubly refreshing to hear the two women build each other up the way Drake and his mentor Sully have always done. (ThoughAfter multiple games saddled with the swaggering masculinity of Drake and his pals, Chloe finally gets someone she can let her guard down around, and the game becomes stronger for it. \u201cIt happens in spite of her, but she's willing to soften and open to the possibility of being vulnerable around someone,\u201d says Claudia Black, who portrays Chloe. \u201cI think it's beautiful that it happens around another woman who has also had to be so strong.\u201d Pairing Chloe and Nadine may have been an unorthodox decision for Naughty Dog to make regarding the Uncharted series, especially since neither were exactly the poster child for women who were looking to befriend others, or anyone for that matter. But for a wildly popular adventure game series prequel from Square Enix and newcomer Deck Nine Games, it made all the sense in the world. Deck Nine Games Life is Strange: Before the Storm is meant as a prequel to 2015\u2019s Life is Strange , building upon a central relationship between two teenage girls. You play as Chloe Price (yes, another Chloe), who\u2019s dealing with an teen-angst trifecta: her father has died; her best friend has suddenly moved away; and her mother has just introduced her to her potential new stepfather. But when Chloe befriends one of the most popular girls in school, Rachel Amber, the two share an electric chemistry\u2014and it kicks off a rock-and-roll fable about two girls finding themselves in a world that\u2019s increasingly unkind, forcing them to adapt to their ever-changing surroundings or get lost in the undertow. The dynamic between the two reminded me of the few times in my own life when I met those special individuals who I thought I\u2019d be bonded to for life\u2014best friends who\u2019d do anything for each other. Watching Chloe drawn to the flickering flame that was Rachel Amber, though, felt unexpectedly resonant, and in a flash I realized why I had disliked Chloe so much in the original Life is Strange : I saw myself in her. I saw a young woman who continued to push others away and tell herself that she's the problem, much like I find myself doing as an adult. \"When people continue to abandon Chloe, she builds a narrative in her head around what that means about her, like it's a condemnation of her,\" says Zak Garriss, Deck Nine Games\u2019 lead writer. \"I suspect we\u2019ve all gone through something like that or we know someone who has.\" When I played through the pair skipping school together to hop on a train to nowhere, or lying to their friends and family, I saw my own unhealthy relationships reflected back at me. The friendship may bring Chloe out of her slump, but it\u2019s also a dangerous one; still, when you have nothing else, even a disastrous friendship seems like one worth pursuing. It\u2019s a cycle I\u2019ve become intimately familiar with on my own quest to find women I can be friends with. But while an imperfect dynamic like Chloe and Rachel's may seem detrimental to the portrayal of friendships between women in gaming as a whole, it's in fact the opposite\u2014providing a nuanced look into characters that many assume are relegated to princesses and femme fatales, bereft of the ability to make or maintain relationships. Indie creators have always outpaced the big-budget sectors of gaming in telling stories about , and for , all people . But with larger studios like Deck Nine and Naughty Dog (who before The Lost Legacy explored female friendship in 2014\u2019s critically acclaimed The Last of Us: Left Behind ) doing the same, the that imbalance may slowly shift. Deck Nine's Garriss says he\u2019s invested in telling \"better stories\" about women in games: \"I'm interested in what it's doing to the industry, what it's doing for an underrepresented community.\" While it isn't perfect\u2014and probably never will be\u2014there\u2019s hope in the fact that developers are actively engaged in working to improve such stereotypical storytelling. In the meantime, I'm still trying to figure out how to get friendship \"right\" as an adult. It may need to begin with introducing the women I know to the amazing characters I've been lucky enough to play.

Universal Pictures So, there\u2019s a trailer for the new Pacific Rim sequel. It\u2019s got those giant robot mechs\u2014aka \u201cjaegers\u201d\u2014and even a few crazy-ass kaiju. Star Wars: The Force Awakens star John Boyega toplines this time around, and Rinko Kikuchi and Charlie Day have returned to reprise their roles. Gone, though, are the original\u2019s director Guillermo del Toro (he\u2019s listed as a producer and story writer), stars Idris Elba and Charlie Hunnam, and screenwriter Travis Beacham. In Pacific Rim terms: the movie might have a new pilot, but the mech's got the same wiring. However, Uprising , which takes place 10 years after the events of the first Pacific Rim , has a strange legacy to uphold. The original film found a mixed critical reception: its 71 percent Rotten Tomatoes score was too high to be a splat, too low for Certified Freshness. But fans, particularly those who heartily appreciate robots and big monsters, took a shine to it; over the past four years the movie has attained something close to cult status. And overseas, particularly in China , the damn thing was a juggernaut, making more than three-quarters of its $411 million worldwide gross outside the US. So the question is: Will Uprising be able to replicate Pacific Rim \u2019s unorthodox brand of success? Judging by this trailer, the film could very well have the juice necessary to tick off the \"fan favorite\" box in that checklist. It got a standing ovation when it premiered today at New York Comic Con, with fans screaming for every new jaeger and kaiju that appeared on screen. And in today's global film marketplace, whether it\u2019s good or not has little bearing on whether or not it will make a lot of money (cough Warcraft cough); an international crowd-pleaser of a franchise that works in China is almost guaranteed to stomp its way into the black. Whether or not it will do any of this with any blood in its veins, though, remains a mystery. Part of what made Pacific Rim so beloved, and so lovingly crafted, was that it was del Toro\u2019s passion project, the kind of \u201cgiant fucking robots versus giant fucking monsters\u201d movie that he\u2019d always wanted to make. The kind that, in his words, saved his life . The bottom line on Pacific Rim has always been that it was big, dumb fun\u2014the kind of city-destroying good time that sells popcorn\u2014but underneath that was always a movie you could tell the director enjoyed making. People felt special about it because they felt del Toro\u2019s love for it; whether or not they\u2019ll feel the same way about Steven S. DeKnight\u2019s passion for the sequel is hard to decipher. DeKnight, and his cast, seem hyper-aware of this. Every member of the cast on stage at NYCC\u2014Boyega, Burn Gorman (returning from the first film as Dr. Hermann Gottlieb), and Cailee Spaeny and Scott Eastwood, both of whom play new jaeger pilots\u2014all referenced del Toro's legacy. \u201cGuillermo set the table and it was a fantastic visual feast,\" DeKnight said. \"We wanted to make sure we honored what he created.\" Boyega, who also serves as a producer on the film, went so far as to call del Toro's world \"sacred science fiction ground\" and promised the sequel is \"everything you want Pacific Rim to be.\u201d So clearly, there's passion. Another passion play DeKnight\u2019s film has is the return of Kikuchi as Mako Mori, the jaeger pilot and undeniable hero of Pacific Rim . The original movie was released at the height of the \u201cWhere are the heroines in Hollywood?\u201d debate and provided an antidote to the stereotypical female characters that typically show up in action films. Her role proved such a breakthrough moment that it inspired a Bechdel Test alternative\u2014the Mako Mori Test \u2014that used as a benchmark a female lead with a storyline that had nothing to do with supporting a man. Mori has been touted in early synopses of the movie as the leader of the new generation of jaeger pilots, but Kikuchi was noticeably absent at the NYCC panel and her character's presence in the trailer amounted to a quick glimpse. Presumably the first trailer was intended to introduce the new cast (and jaegers and kaiju) instead of touting returning players, its success as a continuation of the franchise will depend on how its returning heroine. Fans won't know how prominently she figures until the film hits theaters next March, or at least until more trailers come out, but her presence bodes well. Of course, boding well and doing well are two totally different things. The overall performance\u2014commercially, critically\u2014of Uprising remains to be seen. Based on the trailer, it will be a lot of the same stupid good time that made the first one a hit. And judging by the response of the crowd at NYCC, fans are ready to go once more into the Breach. No need to cancel the apocalypse just yet.

There are some protections against that sort of snooping, like device lockers in the West Wing where staffers are encouraged to leave their phones, and Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, where officials shed all their devices before discussing truly secret issues of national security. But human error is a problem. People don't always comply with SCIF protocols\u2014 including President Trump himself .

Just seven days later, the Federal Communications Commission Friday gave the company a green light to fly 30 balloons over Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands for up to six months. If all goes to plan, Alphabet's balloons will soon help replace the thousands of cellphone towers knocked out of service by hurricane-strength winds. The balloons would provide voice and data service through local carriers to users\u2019 phones. The details of those arrangements aren\u2019t complete. But in its application to the FCC, Alphabet included letters and emails from eight wireless carriers in Puerto Rico, in which they consented for Loon to use their frequencies for disaster relief and to restore limited communications. Two of those agreements were dated Friday. Alphabet has previously deployed Loon to provide emergency phone service, in Peru following flooding there earlier this year . In Peru, Alphabet had already been working closely with a local wireless network, Telefonica, to coordinate spectrum use and prepare handsets to work with its balloons. Related Stories After Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico's Grid Needs a Complete Overhaul In Puerto Rico, \u201cthings are a little more complicated because we're starting from scratch,\u201d an Alphabet spokesperson says. \u201cLoon needs be integrated with a telco partner\u2019s network\u2014the balloons can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d Project Loon was born in Alphabet\u2019s moonshot X division, with the aim of serving the half of the world\u2019s population that is still without internet access. It has launched several successful pilot projects, but has yet to be deployed commercially on a wide scale. It also is embroiled in a lawsuit with Space Data , a small company accusing Alphabet of patent infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, and breach of contract following a failed acquisition bid. With the FCC\u2019s special temporary license in Puerto Rico, Alphabet plans to work along the same lines as in Peru. Thirty Loon balloons will float 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) above the earth in the stratosphere, relaying communications between Alphabet\u2019s own ground stations connected to the surviving wireless networks, and users\u2019 handsets. Each balloon can serve 5,000 square kilometers (1,930 square miles), so the fleet is expected to provide service over all of Puerto Rico and potentially parts of the US Virgin Islands. Alphabet said it would consult with networks in the British Virgin Islands to minimize interference there. Another issue is that Alphabet\u2019s technology is still set up for Peru, so some handsets in Puerto Rico may need updates to use the balloon-connected service. Alphabet says it is working on temporary over-the-air software fixes for affected devices, which could include handsets from Apple, Samsung, and LG. With approval in hand, Alphabet will turn to launching the balloons. Alphabet could not say when it will fly or when service would begin, but a spokesperson said, \u201cWe\u2019re sorting through a lot of possible options now and are grateful for the support we\u2019re getting on the ground.\u201d Restoring voice and data communications cannot come quickly enough for some of the affected. On Tuesday, Mother Jones reported Puerto Rico governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 as saying, \u201cSome people, even though we\u2019ve documented the fact... that we\u2019ve delivered food and water, it hasn\u2019t gotten to some of them. Now, it could be for a whole host of reasons. One of them could be that they couldn\u2019t hear it; the information didn\u2019t get to them.\u201d CORRECTION, Oct. 7, 12:05 am: Project Loon is part of Alphabet, but is not part of Alphabet's Google subsidiary.

Virtual reality, AI, the blockchain, drones, cyberwarfare\u2014these things spike the cortisol in everyone but power users of Github and people with PGP session keys in their Twitter bios. The recent obsession with whether Barack Obama and James Comey did the right thing when confronted with evidence of Russian cyberattacks in 2016 misses the point: No one\u2014no world leader, no FBI director, no masterful subredditor\u2014knows exactly what to do about cyberattacks. The word alone is destabilizing. \nCloser to home, I can\u2019t even think about bitcoin lately without suffering the vapors. If only I had taken the time to listen to that bitcoin ranter on Acela seven years ago and bought $5 worth of bitcoin I\u2019d have $4 million today. \nFive dollars! Clearly I\u2019ve been excessively cautious with cryptocurrency, but I\u2019ve also been spectacularly undisciplined in other areas of my digital life, leaving my phone and laptop eminently hackable. I have too many apps running in my brain\u2019s background, overheating it. What other opportunities am I missing, then\u2014or flanks am I leaving unguarded? \nThe cycle of doubt and self-doubt\u2014 bitcoin sounds fishy; I\u2019m an idiot for thinking bitcoin sounded fishy \u2014can turn palpable, somatic. And that\u2019s when it starts to seem clear that what we\u2019re doing with software is not just interacting with machines, something our emotionally detached left brains can deal with. What we\u2019re doing still, after all these years, is seeking serviceable metaphors that will make sense of the digital onslaught, trying to match its many facets, in scale and tenor, with traditional human experiences. \nOf course, every metaphor carries its own baggage. For example, maybe bitcoin is \u201cmoney.\u201d Money surfaces all the emotional chaos surrounding credit, debt, thrift, riches, banks, bankruptcy. Or maybe bitcoin is a weapon, or cult esoterica. Maybe it\u2019s the dark internet or benign nonsense. With any of those hypotheses comes a set of associations, aversions, even attractions. At the same time, metaphors are poor things that never adequately illuminate the things they stand in for. We\u2019re practiced in the old connections from glittery gold to paper dollars to all that money connotes, but connecting bitcoin (which I defy any reader to clearly picture) to good old coins, the minted ingots used by our grandpas and ancient Romans alike, is a taxing mental operation. \nTo put it simply: Much of digital technology seems to be, in the words of our YouTube debunker, not in sync. It doesn\u2019t quite track. Twitter emotion doesn\u2019t rise and fall the way human emotions do. Similarly, death, final by definition, is not final in Super Mario 0dyssey . GPS tech is not true to the temperature and texture of physical landscapes. Alexa of Amazon\u2019s Echo sometimes seems bright, sometimes moronic, but of course she\u2019s neither; she\u2019s not even a she, and it\u2019s a constant category error to consider her one. \nLiving in the flicker of that error\u2014interacting with a bot as if its sentiments were sentiments\u2014is to take up residence in the so-called uncanny valley, home to that repulsion we feel from robots that look a lot, but not exactly, like us, a phenomenon identified nearly 50 years ago by robotics professor Masahiro Mori. When something gets close to looking human but just misses the mark\u2014like that CGI creep in The Polar Express \u2014it induces fear and loathing, the exact opposite of affection. I\u2019m unaccountably afraid. At root the anxiety is: Who is the human here, and who the simulacrum? \nMori used the notion of the uncanny valley to describe a restrictive aesthetic response to robots. But the internet, by aiming to represent a monstrous range of human experiences that includes everything from courtship and commerce to finance and war, introduces a near-constant dysphoria. An uncanny experience registers like a bad note to someone with perfect pitch. And bad notes are everywhere on the internet. Queasy-making GIFs, nonsense autocorrect, memes that suggest broken minds. The digital artifacts produced on Facebook, Instagram, and Spotify are identifiable as conversation, bodies, and guitars, and yet they don\u2019t sync with those things in the three-dimensional world. Our bodies absorb the dissonance, and our brains work overtime to harmonize it or explain it away. \nConsider my stock response to a friend\u2019s honey-colored Instagram photos that show her on a yacht in Corsica. Is that what life is supposed to look like? Why does my own life by this loud municipal swimming pool look sort of\u2014but not really \u2014like that? We rightly call this jealousy, but the comparison of one\u2019s multisensory experience to a heavily staged photo, passing for existence, entails cognitive discomfort too. \nMy poolside afternoon changes millisecond to millisecond. It also has a horizon line; robust unsweetened audio (yelps of \u201cMarco\u201d and \u201cPolo\u201d in my daughter\u2019s pool-glee voice); a start-and-stop breeze; the scent of a nearby grill; ever-changing and infinitesimal shades that elude pixelation and suggest even hues outside the human spectrum that my sunblock (scented to evoke the tropics) is meant to guard against. What\u2019s more, because it\u2019s my experience, this scene is also inflected by proprioception, the sense of my own swim-suited body present in space. Compared to this robust and fertile experience as a mammal on Earth, isn\u2019t it the Instagram image that\u2019s thin, dry, and inert? \u201cThe imagined object lacks the vivacity and vitality of the perceived one,\u201d philosopher Elaine Scarry wrote in Dreaming by the Book , her 1999 manifesto on literature and the imagination. \nAnd yet. There\u2019s that tile-sized cluster of pixels on my phone. The heightened portrait there, let\u2019s call it Woman in Corsica , makes my own present moment\u2014real life\u2014seem like the impoverished thing. I\u2019m unaccountably afraid. At root the anxiety is: Who is the human here, and who the simulacrum? \nThe good news is that the anxiety of the uncanny is nothing new or unique to digital experience. Every single realist form, the ones that claim to hold a mirror to nature, has made beholders panic\u2014and worse. In the fifth century BC, the Greek artist Zeuxis is said to have painted voluminous grapes that looked so much like the real thing that birds pecked themselves to death trying to eat them. Novels, which were intended to show unfiltered middle-class life in everyday prose instead of fakey verse, drove women to promiscuity by representing their feelings so exactly. And, of course, there was the famous stampede in Paris in 1896, when audiences watching an early movie, Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat , retreated to escape the train hurtling toward them from the screen. \nA Snopes search for these stories turns up nothing; all of them are now considered folklore. But they\u2019re useful. We like stories that suggest that experiences with art and entertainment we now take for granted\u2014realist paintings, novels, the movies\u2014once overwhelmed our ancestors. As a species, we must have learned something: how to stimulate ourselves with movies without being duped. And if we learned it then, we can learn it now. Because while the gap between the real and the replica can seem nauseatingly narrow, we do have a brilliant mechanism for telling reality from artifice. It\u2019s literacy. \nSkillful readers of novels recognize language as a symbolic order with rules that set it apart from the disorder of real life. Musicians recognize sound signals in OGG format as decent representations of the sounds produced by their tubas and vocal cords, but not the music itself. Similarly, the Instagram image of Corsica is not life itself. It\u2019s not even Corsica. It\u2019s software. To read novels, hear recorded music, or scroll through Instagram is not to experience the world. It\u2019s to read it. \nBut we forget this, over and over. Our eyes are still adjusting to the augmented reality of everyday life mediated by texts and images on phones. The oceanic internet has grown far too fast, with the highest aspirations to realism, for anyone to have developed guidelines for reading it without getting subsumed. Our phones even intercede between ourselves and the world. Like last year\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Go , virtual artifacts now seem to embellish everything. And the enchantment they cast is potent: We will, it seems, drive off the road rather than resist the text. Literacy entails knowing when not to read. Framing the internet as a text to be read, not a life to be led, tends to break, without effort, its spell. \nAs David Kessler has written about mental illness, thoughts, ideologies, and persistent images of past or future can \u201ccapture\u201d a person and stall their mental freedom. If this is hard to grasp in the abstract, look at the captivating quality of sexting, doctored photos, or something as silly and fanciful as Twitter, with its birdies and secret codes. Even as artificial and stylized as Twitter is, the excitement there rarely seems like a comic opera to users. Encounter a troll, or a godawful doxer, and it\u2019s not like watching a sitcom\u2014it\u2019s a bruising personal affront. \u201cYou\u2019re a fool,\u201d tweeted by @willywombat4, with your home address, makes the face flush and heart pound every bit as much as if a thug cornered you in a dark alley. Sometimes more. \nBut you don\u2019t cool your anxiety by staying off the internet. Instead, you refine your disposition. Looking at a screen is not living. It\u2019s a concentrated decoding operation that requires the keen, exhausting vision of a predator and not the soft focus that allows all doors of perception to swing open. At the same time, mindful readers stop reading during a doxing siege\u2014and call the police to preempt the word being made flesh. They don\u2019t turn quixotic and mix themselves up with their various avatars, or confuse the ritualized drama of social media with mortal conflicts on battlefields. The trick is to read technology instead of being captured by it\u2014to maintain the whip hand. \nParadoxically, framing the internet as a text to be read, not a life to be led, tends to break, without effort, its spell. Conscious reading, after all, is a demanding ocular and mental activity that satisfies specific intellectual reward centers. And it\u2019s also a workout; at the right time, brain sated, a reader tends to become starved for the sensory, bodily, three-dimensional experience of mortality, nature, textures, and sounds\u2014and flees the thin gruel of text. \nThe key to subduing anxiety is remembering the second wave of YouTube commenters: the doubters. Keep skepticism alive. We can climb out of the uncanny valley by recognizing that the perceivable gap between reality and internet representations of reality is not small. It\u2019s vast. Remember how the body recoils from near-perfect replicas but is comforted by impressionistic representations, like Monets and stuffed animals? So imagine: Twitter does not resemble a real mob any more than a teddy bear resembles a grizzly. If you really go nuts and nuzzle up to a teddy, I guess you could swallow a button eye, but you\u2019re not going to get mauled. Tell this to your poor rattled central nervous system as many times a day as you can remember. Make it your mantra, and throw away the benzos. Nothing on your phone alone can hurt you more than a teddy bear. This article appears in the September issue.

He hoped the information would convince media companies and advertisers that their primary way of doing business online\u2014through banner ads, sold through split-second digital auctions for fractions of pennies\u2014could not last. At industry conferences, he presented chart after chart showing the emerging duopoly of Facebook and Google, the commoditization of quality journalism, and the perils of clickbait content strategies. \nIt was hard to disagree. Analysts estimate that Google and Facebook captured all, or virtually all, of the growth in digital ads last year. Elsewhere, readers don\u2019t look at display ads, let alone click on them. The average clickthrough rate is a measly 0.05 percent, so publishers covered their sites with increasingly obtrusive ads. In 2016, the use of ad blockers increased by 30 percent, according to PageFair , which tracks the data. Meanwhile, advertisers are increasingly concerned about paying for fraudulent clicks from bots or seeing their ads next to offensive content. Despite these challenges, Chartbeat\u2019s solution\u2014selling ads based on metrics like time spent and engagement\u2014failed to catch on.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T14:09:22.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03d5ec30fcf0e62d3ee331bf0b1b63126f085910", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjIDkAGY.Jp7SY89oIarVmJYV27Dz3vP_i164.lT1SC0MNLl7LHFxbZK4unwaotPo-", "site_full": "www.wired.com", "site": "wired.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "US Traffic Deaths Rise for the Second Year in a Row | WIRED", "title_full": "US Traffic Deaths Rise for the Second Year in a Row | WIRED", "published": "2017-10-07T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.1, "main_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/59d7c849e7de350b573d6035/191:100/pass/TrafficjamHP-481496302.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 859, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 513, "comments": 0, "shares": 513}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 82}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03d5ec30fcf0e62d3ee331bf0b1b63126f085910", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjIDkAGY.Jp7SY89oIarVmJYV27Dz3vP_i164.lT1SC0MNLl7LHFxbZK4unwaotPo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aarian Marshall", "published": "2017-10-07T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US Traffic Deaths Rise for the Second Year in a Row | WIRED", "text": "Cars Are Safer Than Ever\u2014But Traffic Deaths Are Climbing Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images Think about payday. The responsible shuffle new cash to pay down debts\u2014that car loan, those lingering college bills, a credit card statement. Others will put money toward day-to-day necessities, like groceries, gas, and rent. And then a few will get a little wild. They\u2019ll nab that pair of shoes they\u2019ve been ogling online; they\u2019ll pick up beer and nachos and have friends over for the game. They\u2019ll drive into the next town over to check out that new restaurant. And this, oddly enough, may be one reason traffic fatalities spiked in 2016, according to new data from the Department of Transportation. Cars may be safer than ever, but 37,461 people died on American roads that year, a 5.6 percent hike over 2015. While fatalities have dramatically declined in recent decades, this is the second straight year the number has risen. It\u2019s too early to say why, exactly, this is happening. Researchers will need much more time with the data to figure that out. But here\u2019s a hypothesis: It\u2019s the economy, (crash) dummy. \u201cPeople drive more in a good economy,\u201d says Chuck Farmer, who oversees research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. \u201cThey drive to different places and for different reasons. There\u2019s a difference between going out to a party in the middle of the night in an unfamiliar area and driving to work\u2014that nighttime driving to a party is more risky.\u201d The economy is doing pretty OK. Consumer confidence has climbed since the depths of the recession in 2009. Unemployment is at a 15-year low. And while wages are crawling upward, they have still increased in the past decade. Plus, gas prices have remained low for the past few years. Researchers have long known that driving deaths rise and dive with the economy and income growth. People with jobs have more reason to be on the road than the unemployed. But this increase can't be pinned on the fact of more driving, the stats indicate. Even adjusted for miles traveled, fatalities have ticked up by 2.6 percent over 2015. You can still blame the economy, because people aren't just driving more. They're driving differently. Better economic condition give them the flexibility to drive for social reasons. There might be more bar visits (and drinking) and trips along unfamiliar roads (with extra time spent looking at a map on a phone). The DOT numbers seem to confirm that drivers involved in traffic deaths were doing different things behind the wheel last year. The feds say the number people who died while not wearing seat belts climbed 4.6 percent, and that drunk driving fatalities rose 1.7 percent. Contrary to what you might expect, the numbers show distracted driving deaths dropped slightly, but experts caution against putting too much faith in such info. The numbers are based on police reports. They're reflections of what cops are seeing at crash sites, but also of what\u2019s in the zeitgeist at the time. It could be that first responders weren\u2019t, for example, looking out for distracted driving last year because it wasn\u2019t in the news as often. This is not to say that public health officials can sit on their driving gloves and wait for an economic downturn to solve the country\u2019s growing road death problem. Engineers can design safer roads and policymakers can lower speed limits . Cops can step up enforcement of seat belt , drunk driving, and distraction laws. States could ratchet up driver education requirements and make tests harder to pass, to make sure the new drivers hitting the road know what they're doing. And then you've got the long-term plays. Today's cars are safer than ever, mostly thanks to stringent crash test requirements and the spread of features like automatic emergency braking. (Twenty automakers have pledged to make that stopping capability available on the majority of new car models by 2022.) Still, they could be safer. Cars with semiautonomous features, like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, Mercedes-Benz\u2019s Drive Pilot, and Audi\u2019s Traffic Jam Assist, are trickling into the market, and research has shown these can prevent crashes. But unless something bizarre happens (a sudden ban on human drivers?) it will take about a decade for the effect of these vehicles to show up in national fatality stats, Farmer says. Then there are fully autonomous cars. The ones that don\u2019t exist yet. \u201cIt is critical that policymakers support the safety benefits of fully self-driving technology,\u201d David Strickland, former chief of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and current head of the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets (a pro-autonomy trade group), said in a statement responding to the crash data. Road safety is the premiere argument used by autonomous vehicle developers asking regulators to ease the way for the tech. But again, don't expect to see their products widely deployed for another decade or so. In the meantime, a tip to keep you, your friends, and the kindly strangers who share the road on this physical plane: Just because you\u2019re out on the town doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re off the hook for staying safe.

Wired Staff Oct 10, 2017 \nThis week saw a tragic start, when late Sunday night a man named Stephen Paddock killed 58 people and wounded hundreds more in Las Vegas. Hoaxes and conspiracy theories flooded the internet in the immediate aftermath, as did questions\u2014since answered\u2014around how Paddock was able to fire at automatic speeds. We also took a look at gun-control tech\u2014but didn\u2019t find much that\u2019s promising. \nThere\u2019s at least a little levity\u2014although more tragicomic, really\u2014in Yahoo announcing that its one-billion account leak in 2013 was actually a three-billion account leak.

Apple update fixes some serious security flaws in macOS high sierra \nOn Thursday, Apple released the first update to High Sierra, the new macOS operating system that debuted at the end of September. And it\u2019s an important one. High Sierra 10.13 had two disappointing credential security bugs at launch, but Apple says that both have been patched in this update. One is a bug that could have let attackers use a third-party app to pilfer usernames and passwords from macOS\u2019s Keychain tool that stores credentials. The other is a flaw that revealed plain text passwords in the password hint for encrypted Apple File Systems volumes. If you added disk encryption with a hint, the plain text of your password would show up in the hint field in the Disk Utility. No bueno. If you already created an encrypted volume before you installed the update, you\u2019ll need to back it up, wipe the drive, reformat the File Systems volume, and then restore from the backup. Either way, use Apple\u2019s \u201cSoftware Update\u201d tool to download the patch. Like\u2026right now. Google calls out microsoft for patching practices \nGoogle\u2019s elite Project Zero team of cybersecurity specialists has called out Microsoft for issuing patches inconsistently, and in a manner that could tip off attackers to vulnerabilities in older versions of the operating system. The fix, Google says, is just to apply the same updates across all iterations, so that hackers can\u2019t infer what vulnerabilities might be hiding where based on a given patch. Alleged dark web vendor arrested en route to beard-growing contest \nTechnically this happened last week, but for hopefully understandable reasons we\u2019re still mentioning here.

While Vallerius lives in France, the feds picked him up in Atlanta, as he was traveling to a \u201cworld beard-growing championship\u201d in Austin, Texas.

Adam Savage Thinks So Norman Chan \nAdam Savage is known as the long-time co-host of MythBusters , and he currently helps run the science and technology website Tested . His latest project is a science fiction interview show called Syfy25: Origin Stories , which he produced in partnership with Syfy. \n\u201cScience fiction has meant so much to me over the years that the minute it got mentioned to me I was like, \u2018Yeah! I\u2019m in,'\u201d Savage says in Episode 276 of the Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. Podcast Download \nGuests include showrunners like Ron Moore and David X. Cohen, authors like Neil Gaiman and Nnedi Okorafor, and media personalities like Chris Hardwick and Kevin Smith. The show celebrates the rich history of sci-fi across various media, and also explores the power of science fiction stories to make people think. \n\u201cIt acts as a Trojan horse,\u201d Savage says. \u201cThis was a constant refrain that my guests kept mentioning, that science fiction can bypass people\u2019s normal partisan filters.\u201d \nSci-fi has always faced hostility from people who don\u2019t understand it, and its reputation has sometimes suffered from an association with low-budget films and TV shows. But Savage says the current state of the genre is very strong, and that first-rate productions like Blade Runner 2049 are sure to broaden its appeal even more. \n\u201c[This movie] is as lyrically allegorical and metaphorical as any piece of literature I have ever read,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing script, the performances are phenomenal, and the directing is as good as anything I\u2019ve seen in film.\u201d \nHe also notes that one of his guests, Kevin Smith, describes pop culture narratives like sci-fi movies and superhero comics as his \u201creligion\u201d\u2014his source for meaning and moral guidance. So could science fiction evolve into something akin to an actual religion? \n\u201cI\u2019m not positive that literature could satisfy that deep need for the transcendent, but I hope it can, because for me it really has,\u201d Savage says. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a tremendous amount from it over the years, not just entertainment, but also thinking about the ways I am a person, a father, a husband, a friend, a citizen.\u201d \nListen to the complete interview with Adam Savage in Episode 276 of the Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy podcast (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below. \nAdam Savage on Blade Runner : \n\u201cI think that one of the ladders that human beings have been climbing for their entire existence is a ladder of understanding how precious consciousness really is. When we realize that there\u2019s a full consciousness in front of us, our morality changes. \u2026 I think of the original Blade Runner as a terrific meditation on what it means to view the other, and to realize that the other might have a full consciousness, where we didn\u2019t ascribe it. The wonderful [scene of] Harrison Ford saying, \u2018She\u2019s a replicant,\u2019 and then immediately shifting to, \u2018How can it not know what it is?\u2019 He has to revert back to his innate racism about the replicants. And that allegory is still extant in the new film.\u201d Related Stories \nAdam Savage on The Expanse : \n\u201cI will tell you one example of how great a family The Expanse is. I had traveled to Toronto to spend a week on the set of The Expanse , and I forgot\u2014I can\u2019t even remember what it was, it was like a razor or something like that. And I mentioned that I didn\u2019t have it and didn\u2019t have time to get it before I got back to my hotel that night, and one of the writers, Ty Franck, mentioned this to Steven Strait, the star of The Expanse , who turned out to live across the street from my hotel. And so half an hour after I got back to my hotel room, there was a knock on the door, and there was Steven with the thing that I needed. And I was like, \u2018That\u2019s a family, right? That\u2019s beautiful.\u2019 And that just made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.\u201d \nAdam Savage on Star Trek : \n\u201cI\u2019ve been seeing the response to the new Star Trek: Discovery , and I\u2019m really excited about it. I got to spend some time with a few of the writers when I was at San Diego Comic-Con. But I think I will get to watch the new Star Trek in probably two days, that\u2019s how busy I am right now. But look, the more Star Trek there is in the world, the better the world is. Because I think that Gene Roddenberry\u2019s original vision still holds\u2014a utopic vision of humanity in which our needs are met and we can use the extra mental space given by the fact that we\u2019ve answered hunger and shelter and safety for all the citizens of the Earth to explore other cultures. [That\u2019s] beautiful.\u201d \nAdam Savage on politics: \n\u201cMy goal is to express myself politically in the politest way possible. I want to speak only in the way that I would if the person I am responding to was standing in front of me, and I compare everything that I say to that. I probably send one tweet for every 10 that I compose, because in my anger and my ire, I write lots of things that I don\u2019t tweet, because I can see that I\u2019m being\u2014in my emotional response\u2014divisive or exclusionary, and I don\u2019t want to be.

And Everyone Else's arrow-of-time-2.jpg WIRED \nPast. Present. Future. \nIn physics , they are all the same thing. But to you, me, and everyone else, time moves in one direction: from expectation, through experience, and into memory. This linearity is called the arrow of time, and some physicists believe it only progresses that way because humans, and other beings with similar neurological wiring, exist to observe its passing. \nThe question of time's arrow is an old one. And to be clear, it's not whether time exists, but what direction it moves. Many physicists believe it emerges when enough tiny particles\u2014individually governed by the weird rules of quantum mechanics \u2014 interact, and start displaying behavior that can be explained using classical physics. But two scientists argue, in a paper published today in Annalen der physik \u2014the same journal that published Einstein's seminal articles on special and general relativity\u2014that gravity isn't strong enough to force every object in the universe to follow the same past\u00bbpresent\u00bbfuture direction. Instead, time's arrow emerges from observers. \nThis all goes back to one of the biggest problems in physics, knitting together quantum and classical mechanics. In quantum mechanics, particles can have superposition. That is, one electron might exist in either of two places, and nobody can say for sure which until it is observed. Where that electron might be is represented by probability. Experimentally, this checks out. \nHowever, the rules change when electrons start interacting with many objects\u2014like a bunch of air molecules\u2014or decohere into things like dust particles, airplanes, and baseballs. Classical mechanics take over, and gravity becomes important. \"The position of electron, each atom, is governed by a probability,\" says Yasunori Nomura, a physicist at UC Berkeley. But once they interact with larger objects, or become things like baseballs, those individual probabilities combine, and the odds of all those collective electrons having superposition decreases. That's why you never see a baseball simultaneously disappear into the left fielder's mitt while also soaring into the upper deck. \nThat moment when particle physics merge with classical mechanics is called decoherence. In terms of physics, it is when time's direction becomes mathematically important. And so, most physicists believe time's arrow emerges from decoherence. \nThe most prominent theory explaining decoherence is the Wheeler-DeWitt equation . It dates to 1965, when a physicist named John Wheeler had a layover at an airport in North Carolina. To pass the time, he asked his colleague Bryce DeWitt to meet him. They did what physicists do: talk theory and play with numbers. The two came up with an equation that, to Wheeler, erased the seams between quantum and classical mechanics (DeWitt was more ambivalent). \nThe theory isn't perfect. But it is important, and most physicists agree that it is an important tool for understanding the weirdness underlying decoherence and so-called quantum gravity. \nHere's where it gets a bit weirder. Although the equation doesn't include a variable for time (which isn't all that weird. Time is something that can't be measured in terms of itself, in physics it is measured as correlations between an object's location ... over time ... anyway, it's weird). But, it provides a framework for knitting the universe together. \nHowever, the two scientists who penned this recent paper say that, in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, gravity's effects kick in too slowly to account for a universal arrow of time. \"If you look at examples and do the math, the equation doesn't explain how time's direction emerges,\" says Robert Lanza , a biologist, polymath, and co-author of the paper. (Lanza is the founder of biocentrism , a theory that space and time are constructs of biological sensory limitations.) In other words, those nimble quantum particles ought to be able to keep their property of superposition before gravity grabs hold. And if, say, gravity is too weak to hold an interaction between two molecules as they decohere into something larger, then there's no way it can force them to move in the same direction, time-wise. \nIf that math doesn't check out, that leaves the observer: Us. Time moves as it does because humans are biologically, neurologically, philosophically hardwired to experience it that way. It's like a macro-scale version of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat. A faraway corner of the universe might be moving future to past. But the moment humans point a telescope in that direction, time conforms to the past-future flow. \"\"In his papers on relativity, Einstein showed that time was relative to the observer,\" says Lanza. \"Our paper takes this one step further, arguing that the observer actually creates it.\" \nThis is not necessarily a new theory. Italian physicist Carlo Rovelli wrote about it in a paper published last year on ArXiv , an open physics website. Nor is it uncontroversial. Nomura says one flaw is figuring out how to measure whether this notion of \"observer time\" is real. \"The answer depends on whether the concept of time can be defined mathematically without including observers in the system,\" he says. The authors argue that there is no way to subtract the observer from any equation, since equations are by default performed and analyzed by people. \nNomura says the authors also fail to account for the fact that the entire universe exists in a medium called spacetime, \"So when you talk about spacetime, you already talking about a decohered system.\" He doesn't go so far as to say the authors are wrong\u2014physics remains an incomplete science\u2014but he disagrees with the conclusions they draw from their math.

WIRED OPINION ABOUT Scott Edwards ( @sxedwards ) is a senior adviser for Amnesty International's Crisis Response Team and a professorial lecturer at George Washington's Elliot School. Though the scene was truly shocking, the short video was similar to many others posted from conflict zones around the world. But then on June 9, another video was posted of the same gunman apparently supervising the execution of four kneeling captives. About a month later, when yet another video of the execution of 20 captives surfaced, the gunman \u2014 allegedly Mahmoud al-Werfelli \u2014 was again visible, a literal commanding presence. When the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Mahmoud al-Werfelli in August for the war crime of murder in Libya, it marked a watershed moment for open-source investigations. For those of us who embrace the promise of the digital landscape for justice and accountability, it came as welcome validation that content found on Facebook and YouTube form a good deal of the evidence before the Court. But this relatively new path to justice is at risk of becoming a dead-end. The explosion of content shared on various digital platforms in recent years has given human rights investigators the unprecedented ability to research grave abuses like the probable war crimes documented in these videos. But there are significant challenges to relying on this material in investigations. Footage is often attributed to the wrong time, place, or people. Tracing a chain of custody for the content often dead-ends at the platform to which the materials were posted. In addition, such platforms serve not only as a repository for materials, but as mediums for advancing narratives, occasionally with the intention of spreading misinformation, inciting hatred, or mobilizing for violence. For years, companies like Facebook, Google, and Twitter have been challenged by governments and the general public to combat hate speech, incitement, and recruitment by extremist groups. To do so, these platforms rely on a mix of algorithms and human judgment to flag and remove content, with a tendency toward either false-negatives or false-positives \u2014 flagging too little or too much by some values-based standard. In June, Google announced four steps intended to fight terrorism online, among them more rigorous detection and faster removal of content related to violent extremism and terrorism. The quick flagging and removal of content appears successful. Unfortunately, we know this because of devastating false-positives: the removal of content used or uploaded by journalists, investigators, and organizations curating materials from conflict zones and human rights crises for use in reporting, potential future legal proceedings, and the historical record. Just as a victim or witness can be coerced into silence, information critical to effective investigations may disappear from platforms before any competent authority has the chance to preserve it. Investigators already know about this risk. Video documentation of the alleged murder of the four kneeling captives by al-Werfelli was quickly removed from YouTube, as were thousands of videos documenting the conflict in Syria since YouTube revamped its flagging system. With effort, some curators of content challenged YouTube on the removals, and some of the deleted channels and videos have been restored. However, it's impossible to know how much material posted by human rights activists or others seeking to share evidence was or will be lost \u2014 including what could amount to key pieces of evidence for prosecutors to build their cases. Though YouTube may store removed material on its servers, the company cannot know the evidentiary or public interest value of the content, as it remains in digital purgatory, undiscoverable by investigators and researchers equipped to make those assessments. Since the only people who can challenge these removals are the original content owners or curators, it puts some at a profound disadvantage and even great personal risk if they try to safeguard access to their flagged content by providing further information, and logging additional risky keystrokes. The people posting the most valuable content for pursuing justice and accountability \u2014 the civilian under siege, the citizen journalist facing death threats \u2014 are often the least able to contest its removal.

Pellet cookers tend to have a recognizable grill-like interior, and a hopper full of wood pellets on the side, which are transported to a \u201cburn pot\u201d under the grill grates via a mechanized auger. (Or, as my wife put it: \u201cYou push the wood pellets in and it burns them.\u201d) The grill plugs into an outlet, allowing that auger to work and offering push-button ignition. The Traeger has a thermocouple probe at the top right of the interior, helping it to monitor the temperature and holding it steady like an oven, while imparting a lovely smoky flavor. For long, low, and slow cooks\u2014ideal for foods like brisket\u2014pellet cookers are stunningly effective. Searing, however, is their Achilles heel, which made me wish that Traeger would replace the stubby grill table on the left side of the Timberline with an electric griddle that would make searing a snap. \nThe Timberline also features Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing three-way communication between the app, the grill, and the cloud. There\u2019s some fantastic potential here, but this is Traeger\u2019s first foray into connected cooking and the lack of experience shows. Combine that with some mechanical difficulties and the grill simultaneously charges into the future and shoots itself in the foot. Fairly inexcusable, considering that it costs $1,700. Smoke It If You\u2019ve Got It \nThe potential here is enormous. The ability to simply set the temperature and walk away offers a huge amount of control, a difference exacerbated when you switch back to a \u201cregular\u201d gas grill or Weber kettle. Set a brisket to 180 and monitor the internal temperature thanks to the built-in probe thermometer and you begin to realize you could, with long, low-temp cooks, crib recipes from a sous vide cookbook and get fantastic, smoky results. Pair that with an app that could understand what\u2019s happening while you cook, and you\u2019ve got a game changer. \nYet when I made beef brisket (Traeger\u2019s \u201cBeginner\u2019s Brisket\u201d), the one recipe that all pellet cookers should simply crush, limitations and defects were exposed. Most notable was the discrepancy between the set temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit and the actual temp the grill cooked at for the first two and a half hours\u2014between 196 and 221\u2014followed by a brief dip to 161 and a return to 190. Roughly, that meant it cooked about 20 degrees higher than the temperature it was set to for the first four hours of the cook. When I swung the temp up to 250 for the later stages of cooking, it did an amazing job of staying within a couple degrees of the target. (These impressive results were repeated a few days later when I made ribs at 225 degrees.) \nToward the end of the brisket\u2019s cook, I encountered a famous problem known as \u201cthe stall,\u201d where the internal temperature of the brisket climbed steadily toward a target temperature of 203 degrees, but plateaued at around 190 for a few maddening hours. If you realize it\u2019s happening, you can get around by jacking up the grill temperature, or tightly wrapping the brisket with foil (a.k.a. \u201cthe Texas crutch\u201d). If the grill or app knows the temperature curve has flattened at the typical stall temperature, why not have the app alert me and tell me some options instead of pushing dinnertime into bedtime? \nNevertheless, it was a fantastic brisket, with a dark exterior \u201cbark\u201d and the pink circle just underneath called a smoke ring, a sign of quality so pronounced that looked like it was painted on with lipstick. \nThat temperature discrepancy in the first phase of the cook made me wonder about the accuracy of the thermometer, so I stuck the Traeger\u2019s probe thermometer under my tongue and learned that either the thermometer was off by almost 10 degrees or I was experiencing a freak attack of hypothermia. \nFor comparison, I put my mom\u2019s years-old Pyrex meat thermometer under my tongue and the dial pointed toward 98.5. \nI ordered a ThermoWorks Smoke , a grill thermometer with both a probe thermometer to track internal temperatures of what you\u2019re cooking and an \u201cair probe\u201d that clips to the grill and monitors the cooking temperature; essentially, replicating the same setup built into the Traeger. Naturally, I put the ThermoWorks cooking probe under my tongue and learned that I was running at 97.2 degrees, but for more accuracy, I created a 32-degree ice bath . The ThermoWorks probes and my mom\u2019s Pyrex all clocked in within a degree, but the Traeger probe read 26. \nYikes. \nThe ThermoWorks Smoke has big magnets on the back and it clamped onto the side of the grill with gusto, as if it was eager to bore through the Traeger\u2019s hull and suck out its brains. I positioned the ThermoWorks \u201cair probe\u201d next to the Traeger\u2019s and found that the smoker ran six to 10 degrees higher than the temperature it was set at. \nThis is bad but forgivable for the set temperature of the grill. On the Traeger\u2019s probe thermometer, though, it\u2019s harder to ignore. Those degrees of difference means that what reads as rare comes out as medium-rare, medium is medium-well, and well-done is a briquette. What\u2019s really unforgivable? You can\u2019t calibrate the Traeger\u2019s thermometers. (Asked about this, a spokesman said, \u201cWe would replace them if there was ever a need.\u201d) \nThat means any programmed cooks I made had built-in flaws that forced me to buy a $100 grill thermometer that I could calibrate. With this setup in the long term, I\u2019d have to forgo much of the allure and promise of the connected capabilities of the grill. Bring the Heat \nUnfortunately, there\u2019s more. When I made ribs, I turned up the temperature toward the end of the cook to get some caramelization and searing. When I returned a few minutes later, the temperature hadn\u2019t gone up but there was a clinking sound I mistook for the fire gaining momentum. Instead, I\u2019d learn that the fire had gone out and the auger kept pushing pellets into the bottom of the grill. \nI fished the ribs on my dad\u2019s grill. \nThe app was also a disappointment, mostly because there was little to no value added by using it. Creating custom cooks inside the app seems like a natural, but for reasons I don\u2019t understand, you can only make them using the dial on the side of the grill; have fun typing in \u201cAunt Janice\u2019s world-famous pulled pork\u201d with that setup. Similarly, why not send an alarm to the app when a target temperature is reached, and drop the grill temperature to prevent overcooking? How about teaching it to deal with \u201cthe stall\u201d? \nTraeger could also do with some more modern recipe options, and make sure those recipes are tested. I ran into trouble where programmed recipes marched on from one step in the recipe to the next without completing the first. Another programmed cook called for a probe in the app, but not on the machine.

The balloons would provide voice and data service through local carriers to users\u2019 phones. \nThe details of those arrangements aren\u2019t complete. But in its application to the FCC, Alphabet included letters and emails from eight wireless carriers in Puerto Rico, in which they consented for Loon to use their frequencies for disaster relief and to restore limited communications. Two of those agreements were dated Friday. \nAlphabet has previously deployed Loon to provide emergency phone service, in Peru following flooding there earlier this year . In Peru, Alphabet had already been working closely with a local wireless network, Telefonica, to coordinate spectrum use and prepare handsets to work with its balloons.

It has launched several successful pilot projects, but has yet to be deployed commercially on a wide scale. It also is embroiled in a lawsuit with Space Data , a small company accusing Alphabet of patent infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, and breach of contract following a failed acquisition bid. \nWith the FCC\u2019s special temporary license in Puerto Rico, Alphabet plans to work along the same lines as in Peru. Thirty Loon balloons will float 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) above the earth in the stratosphere, relaying communications between Alphabet\u2019s own ground stations connected to the surviving wireless networks, and users\u2019 handsets. \nEach balloon can serve 5,000 square kilometers (1,930 square miles), so the fleet is expected to provide service over all of Puerto Rico and potentially parts of the US Virgin Islands. Alphabet said it would consult with networks in the British Virgin Islands to minimize interference there. \nAnother issue is that Alphabet\u2019s technology is still set up for Peru, so some handsets in Puerto Rico may need updates to use the balloon-connected service. Alphabet says it is working on temporary over-the-air software fixes for affected devices, which could include handsets from Apple, Samsung, and LG. \nWith approval in hand, Alphabet will turn to launching the balloons. Alphabet could not say when it will fly or when service would begin, but a spokesperson said, \u201cWe\u2019re sorting through a lot of possible options now and are grateful for the support we\u2019re getting on the ground.\u201d \nRestoring voice and data communications cannot come quickly enough for some of the affected.

From your phone to your living room to your TV to your laptop to your car, the company wants to make sure its virtual helper stays readily available no matter where you are. That, more than a desire for great sound quality or terrific connectivity, explains the new Pixel Buds headphones. \nAt Google's second annual fall hardware gala today, the company announced its first-ever set of headphones. They're wireless earbuds, connected by a rope-like cable that goes behind your head or around your neck. They'll cost $159 when they go on sale in November. \nUsing a touch-sensitive control on the right bud, you can tap to play or pause your music, swipe forward and back to change volume, or long-press to talk to Google Assistant. Their battery lasts five hours, and the charging case holds four charges. And yet even with all those electronics, the Pixel Buds sit remarkably light in my ears. They stick out a bit, but no more than your average wireless earbud. \nThe Pixel Buds are steeped in Google's whole product ethos: They come in the same colors as Google's phones, stow and charge in a fabric case that looks a lot like the Daydream View VR headset, and exist mostly to help you get to Google Assistant faster. Basically anything you'd do with a Google Home , you can do with the Pixel Buds. Press on the right bud and start talking (holding while you speak) and the Pixel Buds' audio processor starts recording your words immediately. There's virtually no delay before you can start talking, which makes talking into the Pixel Buds feel a lot more natural. Once you're done, the Pixel Buds send your words to your phone, where the Assistant processes them and spits back a response. Google \nGoogle recently announced a program for optimizing headphones for Google Assistant, initially partnering with Bose on the new QC35 II . The Pixel Buds seem to work mostly the same way: They can read your notifications aloud, check and send messages, and the like. But since these are Google-made headphones, they're more integrated with Android than anything else on the market. If you buy Pixel Buds and have a recent Android device (running Android N or later), your phone will prompt you to connect your earbuds as soon as you take them out of the case. No hassling in Bluetooth settings\u2014just one tap and you're off. If you get a Pixel, the integration goes even further. You can say \"help me speak French,\" and start speaking and listening through Google Translate. \nSound familiar? It should. I've probably gone too far here without mentioning AirPods . Apple's dangly wireless earbuds were a surprise hit of 2016, and clearly the competition took notice. Google's wireless headphones are at once a validation of the idea\u2014headphones you can wear all day, connect easily, and offer constant access to virtual assistants\u2014and a rejection of Apple's approach. The Pixel Buds include a small loop of cable that tucks into the folds of your ear to keep the buds secure, as opposed to the one-size-hopefully-fits-all AirPods. Adam Champy, a product manager on the project, says that Google connected its buds with a cable because users don't want to deal with lots of small, easily misplaced pieces. Champy wore his Pixel Buds around his neck during a briefing with reporters, and pointed out how much more accessible they were than if they'd been in a case in his pocket every time they weren't in his ears. \nIn a super-short demo, I was impressed by the sound of the Pixel Buds. They were rich and loud, despite only being semi-occluded. Google tried to build headphones people could wear all day, which meant avoiding heavily isolated experiences. But they're only secondarily about sound quality. Ultimately, these are portals to your Assistant, another way to stay connected and get stuff done without needing to look at your phone.

Actually, there are two reasons people laugh. One is that they can\u2019t imagine a huge number of Americans\u2014especially those in the Trump tribe\u2014actually sitting down and meditating. And I, too, have trouble imagining a sea of MAGA hats enveloping a statue of the Buddha. For that matter, I\u2019m not under the illusion that most anti-Trumpers get up every day and meditate. But for reasons I\u2019ll explain, I don\u2019t think these harsh realities are fatal to my American salvation scenario. The other reason people laugh at this salvation scenario is that they think the point of meditation is to cultivate love or compassion or some other warm and fuzzy feeling that might heal the nation. But in fact, mindfulness meditation isn\u2019t fundamentally about love or compassion. Other kinds of Buddhist meditation\u2014such as \u201cmetta\u201d meditation\u2014take on that challenge more directly. More broadly, mindfulness meditation isn\u2019t warm and fuzzy. In a certain sense it\u2019s cool and clinical. It involves, among other things, examining your feelings and deciding whether to buy into them, whether to let them carry you away. Obviously, America could stand for people to be a little less susceptible to getting carried away by their feelings. But the contribution mindfulness can make to bridging the great tribal divide is more powerful than that simple formulation suggests. To appreciate this potential, you have to understand how subtle the psychology of tribalism is. Tribal psychology involves, at one level, some obvious ingredients: rage, vengeance, loathing\u2014the kinds of raw emotions you might imagine when you imagine tribes literally at war. But the psychology of tribalism also involves\u2014in fact, I\u2019d say, it mainly involves\u2014cognitive biases that warp our perception of the world. Cognitive biases have gotten a lot of attention in the popular psychology literature over the past decade. For example, confirmation bias\u2014our tendency to accept and retain information that supports our views and reject or not notice information that contradicts our views\u2014is now pretty famous. But the term \u201ccognitive bias\u201d misleads people about the nature of this problem. \u201cCognition\u201d is often thought of as separate from feelings\u2014it\u2019s the kind of rational, logical process a computer can execute\u2014but in fact feelings often influence cognition. And they seem to play a key role in cognitive biases. Consider the role confirmation bias can play in \u201cfake news,\u201d false or deeply misleading information that spreads widely, typically via social media. Such information is sometimes spread cynically and knowingly. But often it is spread unknowingly, by people who click \u201cretweet\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d without first investigating what they\u2019re sharing. And the reason they don\u2019t do this critical investigation is because the information they\u2019re sharing supports their world view\u2014because, in other words, they are victims of confirmation bias. I sometimes spread dubious information this way myself. And when, having discovered my mistake, I reflect on what made me do it, the answer I come up with is this: Clicking \u201cretweet\u201d made me feel good. After all, the information I was spreading reflected favorably on my ideological tribe and unfavorably on the enemy tribe. What\u2019s not to like? Indeed, if you pay close attention at the moment you\u2019re sharing this kind of news on social media, you may observe a sequence of feelings: a positive feeling upon seeing the news, the subtle but palpable urge to spread it, and the feeling of gratification you get upon spreading it\u2014a gratification that is deepened if this addition to the nation\u2019s discourse then gets a lot of retweets, shares, or likes. These are the feelings that can make you part of the fake news problem. If, on the other hand, you see information that reflects unfavorably on your tribe, you may notice a negative feeling well up, and you\u2019ll probably feel no urge to share the information; you\u2019ll either dismiss it and move on or inspect it critically, looking for flaws. And if you find flaws, this will feel good, and will likely feed an urge to publicize them. So confirmation bias is a \u201ccognitive\u201d bias that is driven by feelings from start to finish. In that sense it\u2019s feelings, more than thoughts, that propel false or misleading information through social media. Yes, Russian bots and conspiracy-theorist crackpots and other nefarious actors have played a role in systematically spreading fake news, but much of the false or misleading information that is now muddying discourse and sustaining the tribal divide is spread unknowingly\u2014innocently, in a sense\u2014by people on both sides of the divide who are acting in accordance with human nature. This is where mindfulness could come in. In my experience, and in the experience of many others, spending 20 or 30 minutes on the cushion every morning doing mindfulness meditation makes you more aware of feelings\u2014not just as you meditate but as you go through the day. When feelings well up that you might otherwise obey reflexively, you\u2019re more likely to reflect on them and decide whether to obey them. Obviously, meditation won\u2019t singlehandedly end fake news. But I think it would reduce the fuel supply for false and slanted information. And that could make a big difference, because the problem with such information isn\u2019t just that it confuses the people who believe it. It also has an unfortunate influence on the people who don\u2019t believe it\u2014the people in the tribe who didn\u2019t spread it. It reinforces their belief that the people in the other tribe are, at worst, knowingly lying and, at best, deeply confused. And probably the former. After all, we tend to interpret the errors of our enemies and rivals in an unfavorable light, while explaining away the errors of our allies in more innocent terms. Indeed, this tendency itself involves a cognitive bias, one that is less famous than confirmation bias. It\u2019s called \u201cattribution error,\u201d and it, too, is dividing America. In a context of intense tribalism, attribution error works like this: If people we identify as members of our tribe do something bad\u2014if they\u2019re mean to someone, say, or they break the law\u2014we tend to attribute the behavior to \u201csituational\u201d factors. They had been under stress at work, or they were pressured by bad actors into misbehaving, or whatever. If members of the enemy tribe do something bad, we\u2019re more likely to explain the behavior in \u201cdispositional\u201d terms\u2014the bad behavior emanates from their basic disposition, their character. It\u2019s just the kind of thing that people like them do. Good behavior works the other way around. If members of our tribe do something good, the explanation tends to be dispositional\u2014their behavior is a simple reflection of who they are. If members of the enemy tribe do something good, the explanation will likely be situational\u2014maybe they were \u201cvirtue signaling\u201d to a particular audience, or maybe they did the right thing because all other options were foreclosed. One consequence of attribution error is that once you\u2019ve been categorized as an enemy, it\u2019s hard to get that label changed. The bad things you do will be attributed to your essential nature, and so reinforce the label, and the good things you do will be explained away as not reflecting the \u201creal you.\u201d So the more Americans there are who are looking at each other through this bias\u2014the more Americans there are who identify with one tribe or the other, and the more intense the identification\u2014the deeper the challenge of near-term reconciliation. This cognitive bias, like confirmation bias, seems to be triggered by feelings. You don\u2019t have to be all that sensitive to pick up on the negative feeling that accompanies the thought of an enemy. This feeling can infuse your very perception of the person with a sense that they possess a kind of \u201cessence of enemy,\u201d an essence that then shapes the way you think about them. So with attribution error, as with confirmation bias, anything that helps you reflect on your feelings before letting them take root, before giving them your obedience, could help. And mindfulness meditation does that. It can make you less reactive, more reflective, less buffeted by unexamined emotion, more equanimous. It can make you at least a bit less inclined to embrace and hang on to that \u201cenemy\u201d vibe when it surfaces. I hope all of this explains why I think that, if most Americans meditated, the prospect of ever-intensifying tribal warfare could start to recede. What it doesn\u2019t explain is why I hold out hope for salvation by mindfulness even though most Americans don\u2019t, in fact, meditate. And, worse still, what meditators there are seem to cluster on one side of the aisle. When I\u2019ve gone to meditation retreats, the parking lots have featured a number of Volvos, Subarus, and Priuses, few if any pickup trucks, and zero bumper stickers that say Make America Great Again. There are four reasons that I nonetheless hold out hope. First, parking lots can be misleading. I have a sister who is a conservative Christian and voted for Trump and has dabbled in mindfulness meditation. One reason that last part shouldn\u2019t surprise you is that mindfulness meditation has in many settings, including the growing number of schools and workplaces where it\u2019s offered, been severed from its Buddhist roots and packaged as simple self-help, as therapy. Such as: \u201cmindfulness-based stress reduction.\u201d And viewing stress mindfully can lead to viewing other feelings mindfully. Indeed, people who teach meditation as a way of handling stress or anxiety often wind up helping students deal with rage, anger, resentment, and other feelings that warp our perception of the enemy tribe. Besides, using mindfulness to deal with any given problematic feeling naturally tends to lead to greater awareness of, and more critical reflection on, other feelings as well, including even the subtler of the feelings that may drive cognitive biases. What starts as simple self-help can wind up making you a better person and a better citizen. Second, meditation on one side of the tribal divide can exert a calming influence on the other side. The way figurative tribal warfare becomes literal tribal warfare is through a positive feedback loop: Hatred and hyperbolic rhetoric on one side lead to more of that on the other side, and vice versa. Well, the positive feedback works in the other direction too. If there is less hatred and less accusatory, hyperbolic rhetoric coming from one side, the amount of hatred and hyperbolic rhetoric on the other side can drop in response. Third, meditation has established a pretty big beachhead and is gaining momentum. A National Institutes of Health survey conducted in 2012 found that 18 million American adults meditated and 21 million practiced yoga, which often has an element of mindfulness. And both numbers were growing.

No underlying principle has guided the design of these learning systems, other than vague inspiration drawn from the architecture of the brain (and no one really understands how that operates either). Quanta Magazine About \nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine , an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences. Like a brain, a deep neural network has layers of neurons\u2014artificial ones that are figments of computer memory. When a neuron fires, it sends signals to connected neurons in the layer above. During deep learning, connections in the network are strengthened or weakened as needed to make the system better at sending signals from input data\u2014the pixels of a photo of a dog, for instance\u2014up through the layers to neurons associated with the right high-level concepts, such as \u201cdog.\u201d After a deep neural network has \u201clearned\u201d from thousands of sample dog photos, it can identify dogs in new photos as accurately as people can. The magic leap from special cases to general concepts during learning gives deep neural networks their power, just as it underlies human reasoning, creativity and the other faculties collectively termed \u201cintelligence.\u201d Experts wonder what it is about deep learning that enables generalization\u2014and to what extent brains apprehend reality in the same way. LUCY READING-IKKANDA/QUANTA MAGAZINE Last month, a YouTube video of a conference talk in Berlin, shared widely among artificial-intelligence researchers, offered a possible answer. In the talk, Naftali Tishby , a computer scientist and neuroscientist from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, presented evidence in support of a new theory explaining how deep learning works. Tishby argues that deep neural networks learn according to a procedure called the \u201cinformation bottleneck,\u201d which he and two collaborators first described in purely theoretical terms in 1999 . The idea is that a network rids noisy input data of extraneous details as if by squeezing the information through a bottleneck, retaining only the features most relevant to general concepts. Striking new computer experiments by Tishby and his student Ravid Shwartz-Ziv reveal how this squeezing procedure happens during deep learning, at least in the cases they studied. Tishby\u2019s findings have the AI community buzzing. \u201cI believe that the information bottleneck idea could be very important in future deep neural network research,\u201d said Alex Alemi of Google Research, who has already developed new approximation methods for applying an information bottleneck analysis to large deep neural networks. The bottleneck could serve \u201cnot only as a theoretical tool for understanding why our neural networks work as well as they do currently, but also as a tool for constructing new objectives and architectures of networks,\u201d Alemi said. Some researchers remain skeptical that the theory fully accounts for the success of deep learning, but Kyle Cranmer , a particle physicist at New York University who uses machine learning to analyze particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, said that as a general principle of learning, it \u201csomehow smells right.\u201d Geoffrey Hinton , a pioneer of deep learning who works at Google and the University of Toronto, emailed Tishby after watching his Berlin talk. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely interesting,\u201d Hinton wrote. \u201cI have to listen to it another 10,000 times to really understand it, but it\u2019s very rare nowadays to hear a talk with a really original idea in it that may be the answer to a really major puzzle.\u201d According to Tishby, who views the information bottleneck as a fundamental principle behind learning, whether you\u2019re an algorithm, a housefly, a conscious being, or a physics calculation of emergent behavior, that long-awaited answer \u201cis that the most important part of learning is actually forgetting.\u201d The Bottleneck Tishby began contemplating the information bottleneck around the time that other researchers were first mulling over deep neural networks, though neither concept had been named yet. It was the 1980s, and Tishby was thinking about how good humans are at speech recognition\u2014a major challenge for AI at the time. Tishby realized that the crux of the issue was the question of relevance: What are the most relevant features of a spoken word, and how do we tease these out from the variables that accompany them, such as accents, mumbling and intonation? In general, when we face the sea of data that is reality, which signals do we keep? Naftali Tishby, a professor of computer science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Miriam Alster, Flash 90. ELSC Art and Brain Week 2016 \u201cThis notion of relevant information was mentioned many times in history but never formulated correctly,\u201d Tishby said in an interview last month. \u201cFor many years people thought information theory wasn\u2019t the right way to think about relevance, starting with misconceptions that go all the way to Shannon himself.\u201d Claude Shannon, the founder of information theory, in a sense liberated the study of information starting in the 1940s by allowing it to be considered in the abstract\u2014as 1s and 0s with purely mathematical meaning. Shannon took the view that, as Tishby put it, \u201cinformation is not about semantics.\u201d But, Tishby argued, this isn\u2019t true. Using information theory, he realized, \u201cyou can define \u2018relevant\u2019 in a precise sense.\u201d Imagine X is a complex data set, like the pixels of a dog photo, and Y is a simpler variable represented by those data, like the word \u201cdog.\u201d You can capture all the \u201crelevant\u201d information in X about Y by compressing X as much as you can without losing the ability to predict Y. In their 1999 paper, Tishby and co-authors Fernando Pereira , now at Google, and William Bialek , now at Princeton University, formulated this as a mathematical optimization problem. It was a fundamental idea with no killer application. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking along these lines in various contexts for 30 years,\u201d Tishby said. \u201cMy only luck was that deep neural networks became so important.\u201d Eyeballs on Faces on People on Scenes Though the concept behind deep neural networks had been kicked around for decades, their performance in tasks like speech and image recognition only took off in the early 2010s, due to improved training regimens and more powerful computer processors. Tishby recognized their potential connection to the information bottleneck principle in 2014 after reading a surprising paper by the physicists David Schwab and Pankaj Mehta . The duo discovered that a deep-learning algorithm invented by Hinton called the \u201cdeep belief net\u201d works, in a particular case, exactly like renormalization, a technique used in physics to zoom out on a physical system by coarse-graining over its details and calculating its overall state. When Schwab and Mehta applied the deep belief net to a model of a magnet at its \u201ccritical point,\u201d where the system is fractal, or self-similar at every scale, they found that the network automatically used the renormalization-like procedure to discover the model\u2019s state. It was a stunning indication that, as the biophysicist Ilya Nemenman said at the time, \u201cextracting relevant features in the context of statistical physics and extracting relevant features in the context of deep learning are not just similar words, they are one and the same.\u201d The only problem is that, in general, the real world isn\u2019t fractal. \u201cThe natural world is not ears on ears on ears on ears; it\u2019s eyeballs on faces on people on scenes,\u201d Cranmer said. \u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t say [the renormalization procedure] is why deep learning on natural images is working so well.\u201d But Tishby, who at the time was undergoing chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer, realized that both deep learning and the coarse-graining procedure could be encompassed by a broader idea. \u201cThinking about science and about the role of my old ideas was an important part of my healing and recovery,\u201d he said. Noga Zaslavsky, left, and Ravid Shwartz-Ziv helped develop the information bottleneck theory of deep learning as graduate students of Naftali Tishby\u2019s. Noga Zaslavsky/Ravid Shwartz-Ziv In 2015, he and his student Noga Zaslavsky hypothesized that deep learning is an information bottleneck procedure that compresses noisy data as much as possible while preserving information about what the data represent. Tishby and Shwartz-Ziv\u2019s new experiments with deep neural networks reveal how the bottleneck procedure actually plays out. In one case, the researchers used small networks that could be trained to label input data with a 1 or 0 (think \u201cdog\u201d or \u201cno dog\u201d) and gave their 282 neural connections random initial strengths. They then tracked what happened as the networks engaged in deep learning with 3,000 sample input data sets. The basic algorithm used in the majority of deep-learning procedures to tweak neural connections in response to data is called \u201cstochastic gradient descent\u201d: Each time the training data are fed into the network, a cascade of firing activity sweeps upward through the layers of artificial neurons. When the signal reaches the top layer, the final firing pattern can be compared to the correct label for the image\u20141 or 0, \u201cdog\u201d or \u201cno dog.\u201d Any differences between this firing pattern and the correct pattern are \u201cback-propagated\u201d down the layers, meaning that, like a teacher correcting an exam, the algorithm strengthens or weakens each connection to make the network layer better at producing the correct output signal. Over the course of training, common patterns in the training data become reflected in the strengths of the connections, and the network becomes expert at correctly labeling the data, such as by recognizing a dog, a word, or a 1. In their experiments, Tishby and Shwartz-Ziv tracked how much information each layer of a deep neural network retained about the input data and how much information each one retained about the output label. The scientists found that, layer by layer, the networks converged to the information bottleneck theoretical bound: a theoretical limit derived in Tishby, Pereira and Bialek\u2019s original paper that represents the absolute best the system can do at extracting relevant information. At the bound, the network has compressed the input as much as possible without sacrificing the ability to accurately predict its label. Tishby and Shwartz-Ziv also made the intriguing discovery that deep learning proceeds in two phases: a short \u201cfitting\u201d phase, during which the network learns to label its training data, and a much longer \u201ccompression\u201d phase, during which it becomes good at generalization, as measured by its performance at labeling new test data. LUCY READING-IKKANDA/QUANTA MAGAZINE; ADAPTED FROM ARXIV:1703.00810 [CS.LG]. As a deep neural network tweaks its connections by stochastic gradient descent, at first the number of bits it stores about the input data stays roughly constant or increases slightly, as connections adjust to encode patterns in the input and the network gets good at fitting labels to it. Some experts have compared this phase to memorization. Then learning switches to the compression phase. The network starts to shed information about the input data, keeping track of only the strongest features\u2014those correlations that are most relevant to the output label. This happens because, in each iteration of stochastic gradient descent, more or less accidental correlations in the training data tell the network to do different things, dialing the strengths of its neural connections up and down in a random walk . This randomization is effectively the same as compressing the system\u2019s representation of the input data. As an example, some photos of dogs might have houses in the background, while others don\u2019t. As a network cycles through these training photos, it might \u201cforget\u201d the correlation between houses and dogs in some photos as other photos counteract it. It\u2019s this forgetting of specifics, Tishby and Shwartz-Ziv argue, that enables the system to form general concepts. Indeed, their experiments revealed that deep neural networks ramp up their generalization performance during the compression phase, becoming better at labeling test data. (A deep neural network trained to recognize dogs in photos might be tested on new photos that may or may not include dogs, for instance.) It remains to be seen whether the information bottleneck governs all deep-learning regimes, or whether there are other routes to generalization besides compression. Some AI experts see Tishby\u2019s idea as one of many important theoretical insights about deep learning to have emerged recently. Andrew Saxe , an AI researcher and theoretical neuroscientist at Harvard University, noted that certain very large deep neural networks don\u2019t seem to need a drawn-out compression phase in order to generalize well. Instead, researchers program in something called early stopping, which cuts training short to prevent the network from encoding too many correlations in the first place. Tishby argues that the network models analyzed by Saxe and his colleagues differ from standard deep neural network architectures, but that nonetheless, the information bottleneck theoretical bound defines these networks\u2019 generalization performance better than other methods. Questions about whether the bottleneck holds up for larger neural networks are partly addressed by Tishby and Shwartz-Ziv\u2019s most recent experiments, not included in their preliminary paper, in which they train much larger, 330,000-connection-deep neural networks to recognize handwritten digits in the 60,000-image Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database , a well-known benchmark for gauging the performance of deep-learning algorithms. The scientists saw the same convergence of the networks to the information bottleneck theoretical bound; they also observed the two distinct phases of deep learning, separated by an even sharper transition than in the smaller networks. \u201cI\u2019m completely convinced now that this is a general phenomenon,\u201d Tishby said. Humans and Machines The mystery of how brains sift signals from our senses and elevate them to the level of our conscious awareness drove much of the early interest in deep neural networks among AI pioneers, who hoped to reverse-engineer the brain\u2019s learning rules. AI practitioners have since largely abandoned that path in the mad dash for technological progress, instead slapping on bells and whistles that boost performance with little regard for biological plausibility. Still, as their thinking machines achieve ever greater feats\u2014even stoking fears that AI could someday pose an existential threat \u2014many researchers hope these explorations will uncover general insights about learning and intelligence. The most important part of learning is actually forgetting. Naftali Tishby Brenden Lake , an assistant professor of psychology and data science at New York University who studies similarities and differences in how humans and machines learn, said that Tishby\u2019s findings represent \u201can important step towards opening the black box of neural networks,\u201d but he stressed that the brain represents a much bigger, blacker black box. Our adult brains, which boast several hundred trillion connections between 86 billion neurons, in all likelihood employ a bag of tricks to enhance generalization, going beyond the basic image- and sound-recognition learning procedures that occur during infancy and that may in many ways resemble deep learning. For instance, Lake said the fitting and compression phases that Tishby identified don\u2019t seem to have analogues in the way children learn handwritten characters, which he studies. Children don\u2019t need to see thousands of examples of a character and compress their mental representation over an extended period of time before they\u2019re able to recognize other instances of that letter and write it themselves. In fact, they can learn from a single example. Lake and his colleagues\u2019 models suggest the brain may deconstruct the new letter into a series of strokes\u2014previously existing mental constructs\u2014allowing the conception of the letter to be tacked onto an edifice of prior knowledge. \u201cRather than thinking of an image of a letter as a pattern of pixels and learning the concept as mapping those features\u201d as in standard machine-learning algorithms, Lake explained, \u201cinstead I aim to build a simple causal model of the letter,\u201d a shorter path to generalization.

Trump should not expect the results to be any better, and they might be much worse. American leaders should be extremely wary of the risks of flagrant nuclear brinksmanship. The paradox of American nuclear power is that the nation\u2019s overwhelming arsenal is almost unusable. The damage created by a single nuclear strike would be so great, it would undermine most American strategic purposes. The public revulsion, even from Washington\u2019s closest allies, would make the United States a global outcast. And American nuclear action would justify others contemplating the same, tearing apart 50 years of global non-proliferation efforts. These are the circumstances that motivated Chinese leader Mao Zedong to call the United States a \u201cpaper tiger\u201d during the Cold War. Mao never took American nuclear threats against his country seriously, as he proved when he attacked US soldiers on the Korean Peninsula, in Indochina, and in other settings. Mao believed that nuclear weapons constrained the United States more than its adversaries. President John F. Kennedy agreed, and began a process of broadening American conventional capabilities (\u201cflexible response\u201d) to create non-nuclear options for combatting aggressors, like Mao. About the Author Jeremi Suri is a professor of history at the University of Texas, and the author of The Impossible Presidency: The Rise and Fall of America's Highest Office . He has written previously for WIRED about Nixon's \"madman\" diplomacy and nuclear weapons . President Richard Nixon inherited the unwinnable conventional war in Vietnam that Kennedy\u2019s flexible capabilities facilitated. Nixon recognized that military options below the nuclear level enabled self-destructive quagmires, as the country sent thousands of soldiers to fight communists in distant, inhospitable lands. The \u201cNixon Doctrine\u201d promised to reduce the use of American conventional forces. The president looked for a way to rely more heavily on nuclear weapons, converting their overwhelming firepower into diplomatic and military leverage, without actually irradiating foreign territories. The destructive power of nuclear weapons remained out of proportion with American political aims, and foreign leaders continued to doubt American will to use them, but Nixon was determined to make his biggest bombs into better bullying tools. As he told Henry Kissinger and other advisers on numerous occasions, he would convince American adversaries that he had strong \u201cguts,\u201d and personal \u201cwill in spades\u201d to get tough where predecessors had backed down. Nixon had to show that the limits on how his predecessors thought about nuclear weapons did not apply to him. He was prepared to think about the unthinkable. He would be less predictable and more experimental. He would act a little \u201cmad,\u201d or at least create uncertainty about whether he still followed the accepted rules of behavior for the leader of the free world. Among serious strategists, \u201cmadmen\u201d are not afraid to fail, or blow up the world and themselves. That is not their preferred outcome, but they are prepared to take massive risks for specific purposes. To be mad is not to be irrational. There is a steely rationality in the willingness to combine extreme force with potential suicide. The madman strategist is ready to press the nuclear button if the adversary doesn\u2019t back down. The adversary will give in, according to the logic, because the potential damage is just too devastating, and he thinks the madman might be serious. During the Cold War, leading American game theorists modeled this behavior. Noble Prize-winning economist Thomas Schelling called it the \u201cthreat that leaves something to chance.\u201d Daniel Ellsberg of Pentagon Papers fame spoke of the \u201cpolitical uses of madness.\u201d Henry Kissinger worked closely with Schelling and Ellsberg during his two decades at Harvard University, and he brought this thinking to the White House. In the first year of the Nixon administration, Kissinger and the president implemented a madman strategy to scare the Soviets into helping the United States extricate itself victoriously from Vietnam. Nixon hoped to withdraw American soldiers, and simultaneously gain desired concessions from the communists, by encouraging the fear that he would go nuclear. Nixon instructed Kissinger to tell foreign leaders that the president had become unhinged, even obsessed with getting favorable terms in Vietnam. This was largely true, but Nixon, Kissinger, and every cabinet official in the administration remained unwilling to consider a nuclear strike in Vietnam, or anywhere else. To be mad is not to be irrational. There is a steely rationality in the willingness to combine extreme force with potential suicide. The Nixon-Kissinger madman strategy failed because Soviet and North Vietnamese leaders, like Mao Zedong in China, recognized that the United States had much more to lose than gain from turning the Vietnam War into a nuclear conflict. Nixon could make Indochina unlivable, but he could not save the South Vietnamese government, or America\u2019s reputation as a bulwark of freedom, by feigning madness. All the major actors saw through Nixon\u2019s bluff. President Donald Trump seems not to know this history, nor do most of his advisers. He appears, however, drawn to the same strategy as Nixon. Trump has many incentives to try and convince foreign adversaries that he is \u201cmad,\u201d in hopes that they will back down from long-standing defiant behaviors without heavy costs to the United States. He wants big victories with small sacrifices\u2014a good \u201cdeal\u201d\u2014and nuclear threats call out as the obvious instrument. Trump has focused on North Korea because American power so overmatches this small, isolated country. Yet, for decades its regime has broken all the rules: running major international criminal operations, sharing missile technology with other countries, and, of course, developing an intercontinental nuclear weapons program capable of damaging American territory. Presidents since Bill Clinton have combined sanctions with threats of force, backed by a broad international coalition, to pressure North Korean leaders to cease their defiant activities, without success in stopping the Hermit Kingdom\u2019s nuclear ambitions. If anything, successive dictators in Pyongyang have benefited from showing their suffering people that they can stand up to the United States. Kim Jung Un, the young and largely untested current dictator, has made Trump a useful adversary, challenging his claims of American strength as Mao Zedong challenged Cold War predecessors. Trump\u2019s instinctive responses that he will \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea and press Kim \u201clike never before\u201d require the president to do more than just shout, but also act, especially as North Korea continues to test nuclear bombs and missiles.

Someday, robocars will dominate American roadways, each racing along just inches from its neighbors, safely under the control of a computer that never makes mistakes. No more congestion, fewer atmosphere-choking emissions, and crucially, a drastic drop in deadly crashes. Someday. Autonomous vehicles are truly on the way, but until they complete their conquest, they'll have to share the road with awful human drivers. People are unpredictable. They don\u2019t always follow the rules. They get distracted, brake late and hard, and make aggressive lane changes. They've already proved a menace to the robots: A quick check of records from the California DMV shows humans have a nasty habit of rear-ending driverless cars stopped at red lights or stop signs. The solution? Keep 'em separate. Give each class of car its own lanes, or even entire roads. That's the thrust of a white paper proposal that imagines an \u201cautonomous vehicle corridor\u201d replacing the I-5 freeway between Seattle and Vancouver. In other words, that entire stretch of critical roadway linking two major cities across an international border would be given over to driverless cars by 2040, with no old-fashioned, human piloted, cars allowed. VC firm Madrona Venture Group first proposed the idea last year, and has now refined it to explain how such a radical proposal could be phased in over time. The white paper's authors include Tom Alberg, who serves on the Amazon board, and Craig Mundie, former CTO of Microsoft and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. The Seattle-based group looked at a stretch of road close to home, where they'd personally experienced frustrating traffic jams, but the idea could work anywhere. \"I do believe that the points we make in the paper can be generalized to a lot of interstates, and metropolitans areas,\" says Alberg. In fact, they might prove easier to implement elsewhere, without the whole two-country thing complicating matters. In the early days of the transition, any autonomous vehicle, no matter its powertrain or number of occupants, would be allowed to use existing HOV lanes on the I-5. These carpool lanes are usually separated from the rest of the traffic, making them easy to handle even for today\u2019s semi-autonomous driving systems. The Madrona team says this should be implemented within a year. By 2025, that HOV lane would be closed to human drivers, along with the one next to it (the highway is eight lanes wide). The paper's authors say those two lanes could be used as three, as autonomous vehicles can safely drive more closely together. By 2030, the majority of the highway would be closed to human drivers, with the takeover complete by 2040. \u201cThis final transition will require some tipping point in terms of vehicle availability and public interest,\" the authors write. \"We believe this will happen in the next ten to twenty years, when usage and data will demonstrate the dramatic benefits of autonomy along the dimensions of safety, efficiency, and productivity.\u201d The white paper restrains its proposal to the 140-mile stretch of I-5, but it's easy to imagine someplace like California signing on. The Golden State already allows electric cars access to coveted carpool lanes, to encourage low-emissions driving. The same carrot could encourage the adoption of the safer autonomous vehicles that should reduce overall collisions. If you think all this sounds grossly unfair to people who can\u2019t afford or don't want a driverless car, don\u2019t freak. The benefits of improving traffic flow could extend to all road users\u2014at least while the humans are still allowed. A University of Illinois study found that if just five percent of vehicles are autonomous on a regular road, that's enough to eliminate those stop-and-go pulses of traffic that humans cause by not driving smoothly. The team sent one autonomous vehicle onto a track with 20 regular drivers, and found it completely cut \u201cphantom traffic jams,\u201d by acting as a pace car. British traffic engineers employ a similar concept on \u201csmart motorways\u201d which use variable speed limits to keep everyone moving smoothly, even if it\u2019s at a slower pace. The result is usually a quicker journey overall, with fewer sudden changes in speed and thus fewer crashes. Of course, a white paper from some VC firm won't convince any transportation agency to make such a major change. But Alberg says the goal is to convince traffic engineers, transportation commissions, and highway planners to start taking the changing world of AVs into consideration. At first, his group got little traction, but they're heartened that the Washington State DOT has asked them to testify on the idea at its next public meeting. If you want to be ready for the carpool lane and you have the cash, you can already buy a car that at least partially drives itself. Tesla , Cadillac, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan , and others all offer cars that can handle themselves on the highway to varying degrees. That tech will gradually make its way down market, and Alberg and his co-authors want the decision makers to clear the road for it. Robocars En Route Self-driving cars are going to need to be much safer than puny humans to be accepted, so they'll need superhuman senses . The war for jobs between humans and robocars has begun.

Use Messenger Lite instead \nFacebook originally developed Messenger Lite for low countries with slow internet connections, but there's nothing to stop anyone from making the switch By Brian Barrett Originally published by WIRED US 3 days ago Originally published by WIRED US Monday 9 October 2017 MarySan/iStock \nStatistically speaking, there's a pretty good chance you\u2019re one of the 1.2 billion people who use Facebook Messenger at least once a month. Anecdotally, there\u2019s a decent chance you harbour deep resentments toward its sluggishness, its bloat, and its liberally borrowed Snapchat features. Friends, there\u2019s a better way. It\u2019s called Messenger Lite . Advertisement \nYou may have heard of Messenger Lite already, and if you live outside of the US, UK, Canada, or Ireland, you may already be using it. Facebook first launched Lite a year ago, intending it for markets whose fickle or low-bandwidth internet connections would collapse under the weight of the full-fledged Messenger platform. This week, Lite launched for those four more developed markets as well. And guess what? You should switch over to it immediately. \nThat directive comes with a couple of caveats: If you have an iPhone, this does not apply to you. Sorry! Facebook only released Messenger Lite on Android, with no signs of an iOS version in the offing. Secondly, if you are for some reason heavily invested in the Facebook Messenger games ecosystem, which I know must exist because there is a game controller tab in the Messenger app every time I open it, you should stick with the full-fledged version. Also, Lite doesn't support Secret Conversations , Facebook's end-to-end encrypted chat, but hey, that's what Signal's for anyway. \nAnd that\u2019s it! Everyone else: Let\u2019s explore why Lite is absolutely right for you. Read next At Facebook's big VR showcase, the big news wasn't VR By Rowland Manthorpe Lite As a Feather \nIt\u2019s easier to focus on what Lite does have than what it doesn\u2019t, because the list is so short. When you open Lite up, you get three gloriously straightforward tabs: Home , which shows your existing chats. Contacts , which, you know, and Profile , where you can adjust your notification settings, look at your message requests, switch accounts, report any issues, and that\u2019s pretty much it.No, really, that\u2019s all! There\u2019s no funhouse mirror room of tabs within tabs like you find in Messenger, in which opening the app presents you with, by my count, 10 tappable options (not including your recent conversations): Home , Contacts , Camera , Games , and Bots tabs, a Compose bubble, a Profile icon, and the option to sort chats by Messages , Active , Groups , and Calls . Advertisement \nI got tired just counting those, much less navigating them. And it never stops. Open a composition window in Messenger and you get options for your camera, for images, for voice dictation, for emoji and GIFs and stickers. You can call or video chat. Press the \"plus\" sign and you can send money, or your location, or summon a Food Network branded extension for some ungodly reason. You can send a thumbs up. You can also, I\u2019m fairly certain, still type actual words. \nSome of those choices persist in Lite, but not nearly enough to cause paralysis. You can still send a sticker, but it doesn\u2019t animate. You can still snap a photo or dictate or call. But Lite does not contain the intricate, endless tunnel system that Messenger employs to squeeze all of its features into one bitty app. You can\u2019t get lost in Lite. You can, though, send and receive messages quickly and efficiently, which seems just about perfect for an app called Messenger. \nAs user experience goes, I\u2019m not sure what else to tell you, other than that all of the puffery in and around Messages mostly exists to keep you staring at Messages rather than necessarily improving your life and mind. You only have so many engaged minutes to give in one lifetime. Don\u2019t spend them lobbing ingredients at a Food Network bot. Shoot the Messenger \nLite doesn\u2019t just save you time because there\u2019s less to fiddle with. It also spares you very real seconds\u2014and frustration\u2014by not sputtering under its own weight, as its fuller-featured counterpart most certainly can and does. It\u2019s a greyhound next to a slobbering Messenger mastiff. Advertisement \nSlimming down has other, unseen benefits as well. Lite takes up less than 10MB on your phone\u2014and nearly 10 times less space than Messenger. The side benefit of stripping down so many features is that you use far less data. And it won\u2019t stress your battery as much. \nIf you\u2019re a Messenger power user, well, frankly you haven\u2019t read this far because you\u2019ve already switched back to your Word With Friends game. But everyone else: Switch to Lite. You can still get in touch with anyone who has a Facebook account. You can still make free calls over Wi-Fi. You can still give a thumbs up. But you can do it all without feeling like you\u2019ve been dropped inside a digital labyrinth, a social (media) experiment to see just how many times you can tap your screen without actually accomplishing anything. \nCivilisation may well have reached a point where contacting people over Facebook is an occasional necessity.
