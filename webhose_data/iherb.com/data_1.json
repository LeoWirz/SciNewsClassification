WPIs are costly to use, but rate among the best proteins that money can buy. That\u2019s why they\u2019re the first ingredient you read on the Gold Standard 100% Whey label. By using WPI as the primary ingredient along with premium ultra-filtered whey protein concentrate (WPC), we\u2019re able to pack 24 grams of muscle-building protein into every serving. ON\u2019s attention to detail also extends to mixability. This super quality powder has been instantized to mix easily using a shaker cup or just a glass and spoon. There\u2019s no doubt that this is the standard by which all other whey proteins are measured. \nBeyond The Basics Nearly 79% Protein by Weight (24 g of protein per 30.4 g serving size) Whey Protein Isolates (WPI) Main ingredient. Whey Protein Microfractions from Whey Protein Isolate and ultra-filtered whey protein concentrate. Over 4 grams of glutamine & glutamic acid in each serving More than 5 grams of the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine in each serving The \u201cGold Standard\u201d for protein quality. Suggested Use \nDirections: \nSpoon Stirred: Gold Standard 100% Whey is instantized. That means if you forgot your shaker cup or don\u2019t have time to get out the blender, just add one rounded scoop of Gold Standard 100% Whey to a glass filled with 6-8 oz of water or your favorite beverage. Then mix it up with a spoon. Stir for 30 seconds or until powder is completely dissolved. Tip: Adjust the taste for your Gold Standard 100% Whey by varying the amount of liquid that you use to prepare it. For a bolder flavor with slightly more body and sweetness, mix each scoop with 4-6 oz of water, milk, or your favorite beverage. For a milder tasting, less sweet shake, use 8-10 oz of liquid per scoop. \nShaker Cup: Bringing a shaker cup with you to the gym is the best way to get a dose of protein immediately after you work out. Just pour in 6-8 oz of your preferred beverage and then add one rounded scoop of Gold Standard 100% Whey to your shaker cup. Cover and shake for 25-30 seconds. \nBlender: Add one rounded scoop of Gold Standard 100% Whey to a blender filled with 6-8 oz of water or your favorite beverage. Blend for 20-30 seconds. Then add 1 or 2 ice cubes and blend for an additional 30 seconds. Shake Up Your Shake: By adding fresh or frozen fruits, peanut butter, flaxseed oil, coconut and other ingredients, you can make an even more delicious shake. Stack Your Shake: You can make Gold Standard 100% Whey an even better post workout product by adding supplements like creatine, glutamine, BCAA, and concentrated carbohydrates powders. \nThink Outside The Glass: Gold Standard 100% Whey can be used for more than just protein shakes. Try mixing a scoop into oatmeal, yogurt, or the milk that you pour over your morning breakfast cereal. Better yet, increase the protein content of muffins, cookies, brownies, etc. by adding a scoop or two to your baked goods recipes. \nSuggested Use: Consume enough protein to meet your daily protein requirements through a combination of high protein foods and protein supplements. For the best results, consume your daily protein allotment over several small meals spread evenly throughout the day. \nServing scoop included, but may settle to the bottom during shipping Other Ingredients \nProtein blend (whey protein isolates, whey protein concentrate, whey peptides), cocoa (processed with alkali), lecithin, natural and artificial flavors, acesulfame potassium, aminogen, lactase. \nAllergen Information: Contains milk and soy (lecithin) ingredients.
