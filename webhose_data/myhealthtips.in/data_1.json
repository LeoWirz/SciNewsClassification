Each kidney contains millions of filtering units that are known as nephrons. They work as efficient filters and help to keep the composition of the blood stable, which in turn helps the body function properly. The kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood daily and produce 1 to 2 quarts of urine, which mainly contains extra fluid and waste material. \nKidney infection can happen to anybody but women are more prone to this in comparison to men as women have shorter urethra which makes the bacteria reach the kidneys easily.
