This process of adding up the wasted votes in each district is a little cumbersome. But this formula can be simplified to a theoretical relationship between vote share and the number of seats that a party should win. Over all, it\u2019s a simple measure that elegantly follows the logic of partisan gerrymandering. And it satisfies many of Justice Kennedy\u2019s requirements for a gerrymandering test. It does not, for instance, require an analysis of hypothetical elections, and it\u2019s straightforward enough to understand. What Works Well Does it work? Well, the results do look about right. The congressional and state legislative maps that have been considered most notorious are found to be in violation using this standard. Exactly which states violate the efficiency gap depends a bit on the details. Wisconsin\u2019s state legislative districts are in question in the case, but the basic issues are the same for congressional maps, and we\u2019ll focus on those here. There are two potential standards for whether a state\u2019s congressional map is in violation: the 7 percent threshold suggested earlier, or if the plan costs a party two seats in a state. Small states are likelier to fail the percentage threshold test, while the two-seat threshold is more likely to trip up big states. There are also judgment calls needed on how to handle uncontested elections \u2014 here, we impute the results and turnout using a model based on recent congressional and presidential election results. But the conclusion is basically the same no matter the approach. In looking at the 2016 congressional elections, there are five states in violation by both the seat and percentage measures: Pennsylvania, Texas, North Carolina, New York and Michigan. With the exception of New York, no one would dispute that these lines were ruthlessly drawn to favor the Republicans. In addition, there\u2019s a longer list of medium-size states that violate the percentage measure but don\u2019t quite hit a two-seat threshold. Ohio, Georgia, Maryland, South Carolina, Virginia and Alabama all have efficiency gaps over 10 percentage points in favor of the party that controlled redistricting, while Indiana has a 9 percent efficiency gap. All of these congressional maps could be vulnerable to a legal challenge under the proposed standard. These results would largely pass the \u201cgut-check\u201d test for most fair-minded observers. But they\u2019re not quite perfect either, and they hint at some of the limitations of the test. Illinois, where Democrats plainly used the redistricting process to their advantage, is considered well balanced by this measure. It actually has a Republican-leaning efficiency gap. And New York, drawn by a court-appointed magistrate, is considered a Republican gerrymander with a 10 percent efficiency gap in favor of the Republicans. But in truth, few would argue that New York\u2019s map is balanced against the Democrats at all, let alone by so much. So what\u2019s going on? Political geography. What Doesn\u2019t Work Well Gerrymandering isn\u2019t the only reason one party might \u201cwaste\u201d many more votes than the other. Parties can naturally \u201cpack\u201d or \u201ccrack\u201d themselves, simply because of how their voters are distributed geographically. The efficiency gap doesn\u2019t distinguish between votes wasted by gerrymandering or by natural causes. That\u2019s probably the biggest practical limitation of the measure. It\u2019s not a small issue. Democrats routinely win major cities with more than 80 percent of the vote. Nationally, virtually all of the seats with the most wasted votes in victory are Democratic-held urban districts. For the most part, they\u2019re not gerrymandered at all. Number of wasted votes in victory by congressional district 2016 presidential election The effect of all of these wasted Democratic votes in urban areas is considerable. It\u2019s enough, for instance, to make a fair map in New York look like a partisan gerrymander. There, Hillary Clinton won more than 75 percent of the major party vote in 10 of the state\u2019s 27 districts. But no gerrymandering was required as Mrs. Clinton won 81 percent of the major party vote in densely populated New York City. Similarly, the efficiency gap measure makes Illinois\u2019s Democratic gerrymander look like a balanced map. Mrs. Clinton won 78 percent of the major party vote in Cook County, which includes 40 percent of Illinois\u2019s population. The Democrats made a herculean effort to undo this disadvantage. They unpacked Chicago and Cook County as best they could, spoking the city\u2019s districts out to the suburbs, exurbs and even the countryside. But even this was insufficient to give the Democrats a real advantage. Republicans and Donald J. Trump still won seven of Illinois\u2019s 18 congressional districts, even in a state Mrs. Clinton carried easily. Geography is probably the biggest reason Republicans are skeptical of the efficiency gap. Various amicus briefs contend that the measure is biased against Republicans. They argue that a remedy could even require maps that violate nonpartisan criteria, like those districts that spoke out of Chicago. There\u2019s some merit to the Republican argument. If Democrats are at a geographic disadvantage compared with the Republicans, Democrats would generally have more flexibility to draw maps that deviate from nonpartisan standards, like compactness or following jurisdictional lines, without generating a 7 percent efficiency gap violation as they have in Illinois. Republicans, meanwhile, might draw relatively fair maps that might seem to disadvantage Democrats. Indiana is a good example. One could argue that the courts shouldn\u2019t view Democratic gerrymanders as especially troubling if they don\u2019t create the same burden on Republican voters to translate their votes to seats, but Republicans are unlikely to see it that way. Making matters worse for the Republicans: The efficiency gap isn\u2019t great at measuring the one big Democratic geography advantage: Hispanic districts. Here, the Democrats\u2019 advantage is that they can translate votes to seats at an efficient rate, thanks to the extremely low turnout-to-population ratio of Hispanic areas, which, for good measure, are not always overwhelmingly Democratic. The efficiency gap, if anything, gets this backward. It\u2019s measuring wasted votes, after all, and the low turnout of these districts means that the Republicans waste very few in Hispanic districts. Right now, Illinois and New York are probably the only two states where the efficiency gap is misled by geography. But it could be a much bigger issue in the future. An easy way to tell is to look at the 2016 presidential race rather than U.S. House races. Based on presidential results, efficiency gap violations would spread to 18 of the 26 states with more than five congressional districts. The nonpartisan maps in Arizona and Minnesota, the bipartisan map in New Jersey, and, incredibly, the Democratic-drawn map in Illinois would all violate the 7 percent threshold in favor of the Republicans. It\u2019s worth noting that there isn\u2019t much danger that \u201cfair\u201d maps will be found to be unconstitutional gerrymanders, even if they fail the efficiency gap. Under the test proposed by the plaintiffs, the courts would have to find motive as well. Similarly, the state would have the opportunity to show that the imbalance was because of political geography. But the presidential election results nonetheless show how significant the Democratic geography disadvantage has become. It can easily create the appearance of a partisan gerrymander. It is directionally consistent with the notion that the Democratic geography disadvantage would somewhat bias the efficiency gap measure against the Republicans. And it hints at a core challenge for the plaintiffs: The efficiency gap isn\u2019t as easy as it looks. The Role of the Courts The courts would have to assess whether geography explains the \u201cefficiency gap\u201d in just about every case. In the Wisconsin case, the federal court concluded that political geography did not explain the entirety of the Republican edge because there were alternative plans with a smaller Republican advantage. If this ultimately becomes a standard way to rebut the geography argument, as it has in racial gerrymandering cases, gerrymandering opponents will probably be well off. It is usually possible to draw a relatively fair map, even in states where geography really does significantly burden one party. But things get more complicated if the courts don\u2019t simply accept the presence of an alternative, fair plan as proof that geography isn\u2019t responsible. After all, the fact that a more balanced map was possible doesn\u2019t prove that a less balanced map was a result of partisan gerrymandering, as the New York and Minnesota maps plainly show. The difference between the presidential election results and congressional election results hints at another problem: The efficiency gap is very noisy. It can shift back and forth from cycle to cycle. That's mainly because the efficiency gap emphasizes the difference between winning and losing a district. If you win by one vote, all of your opponents\u2019 votes are wasted, and just one of yours; lose by one vote and the opposite is true. As a result, the courts would probably need to look across many elections to assess whether a map is in violation. They would also probably check to see whether the result would be very different if the election had gone a little differently. The courts will undoubtedly consider other potential measures of partisan symmetry or gerrymandering, including whether the map violates nonpartisan criteria like compactness or violating jurisdictional lines. None of this represents an insurmountable challenge to the efficiency gap. But it means that the efficiency gap isn\u2019t really what it seems. It is not a test of partisan gerrymandering. It is a test of whether a congressional map burdens the voters of a political party to an extent that is likely to be persistent for a decade. Whether voters were burdened because of an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, geography or bad luck is another matter. It\u2019s the sort of matter that the courts have been resolving for decades in racial gerrymandering cases, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy or clear. What Might Be Coming in 2020 The efficiency gap has real limitations. But from a practical standpoint, this is not necessarily a deal breaker. The efficiency gap is not the entirety of the plaintiff\u2019s proposed legal test. The standard of motive would probably prevent fair, nonpartisan maps from being struck down. The opportunity to show that geography, not gerrymandering, was responsible for the bias would most likely protect those states as well. And the courts could consider other measures, as the federal courts did in the Wisconsin case. There is a better chance that the efficiency gap will fail to capture some maps that deviate considerably from nonpartisan standards like preserving communities of interest . These maps are likelier to be Democratic-led gerrymanders, given the party\u2019s distinct geographic disadvantage. But anyone afraid of letting, say, the Democratic gerrymander in Illinois get by should be concerned about what might be coming in 2020. In 1986, Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor wrote that gerrymandering was a \u201cself-limiting\u201d enterprise. A majority party must weaken some of its safe seats to win additional seats; therefore, gerrymanders can wind up increasing the number of vulnerable seats. This was probably right in 1986. The country\u2019s political geography wasn\u2019t so reliably and deeply polarized, and that limited what a gerrymander could accomplish. But this wasn\u2019t so true by 2010, and it is even less true today. There are now strong incentives for parties to pursue gerrymanders that go much further than they did in 2010. In 2020, many states could all but end competitive congressional districts in their state. Take Pennsylvania. Today, Democrats hold only five of the state\u2019s 18 congressional districts. It\u2019s hard for Democrats to imagine that it could be worse. But it could be. After all, there are still five competitive, Republican-held districts in southeastern Pennsylvania outside Philadelphia. Why are there competitive districts in southeast Pennsylvania? At the time Pennsylvania Republicans redrew the map, Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s point about self-limiting gerrymandering was quite relevant. Democrats had a record of competing across rural and post-industrial Pennsylvania, even though President Obama didn\u2019t fare especially well on traditionally Democratic turf. Republicans had little incentive to dilute the Philadelphia suburbs further, and they would have been endangering their central Pennsylvania seats anyway. That logic may not hold today. In fact, it\u2019s not a given that there have to be competitive districts in the Philadelphia suburbs anymore. Mrs. Clinton won 41 percent of the major party vote in the 14 districts outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, including the fifth Democratic district in northeast Pennsylvania. Republicans could probably figure out a way to make several or even all of the competitive districts in southeastern Pennsylvania safely Republican. There would be a practical challenge in spoking the Philadelphia suburbs to such an extreme extent, but it could probably be done, and even if it couldn\u2019t they could still greatly improve on the map they have now. It\u2019s not wholly different from the way Republicans currently treat the Philadelphia suburbs, or how they treat Salt Lake City or Austin, Tex. \u2014 the latter of which is split among a staggering six congressional districts. If Democrats adopted a similar approach, they could easily erase the last Republican districts in states like Maryland or Oregon. The Republicans could end the Democratic districts in Kansas City, Mo; Louisville, Ky.; or Indianapolis. Absent a Supreme Court affirmation of a measure like the efficiency gap \u2014 and there\u2019s no telling how the court will decide \u2014 the Voting Rights Act would be the only meaningful limit on partisan gerrymandering. Otherwise, only a vague, lingering attachment to the norms of the past might hold states back.

That document became public late Monday, adding to the intrigue of whether Uber may have known it was getting stolen information for its autonomous vehicles operation. The document that became public was a due diligence report that Uber commissioned last year before buying an autonomous truck start-up, Ottomotto, for $680 million.\nThe start-up was founded by Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer who had worked at Google\u2019s self-driving unit before it became Waymo. Mr. Levandowski left Google six months before Uber\u2019s acquisition of Ottomotto, and has been at the center of accusations that he stole information about Google\u2019s self-driving technology and used it at Uber.\nThe due diligence report, conducted by the cybersecurity firm Stroz Friedberg from March 2016 to August 2016, paints one of the clearest pictures of the timeline of events leading up to Uber\u2019s acquisition of Ottomotto and exactly how much Uber knew of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s attempts to retain and access information taken from Google.\n The document\u2019s release is the latest salvo in the lawsuit between the two biggest players in the nascent self-driving car industry. Waymo filed suit against Uber in February , spurring a chain of events that ultimately resulted in the removal of Mr. Levandowski from his position at Uber. The suit, which has implications for which company may take the lead in the race around autonomous vehicles, is set to go to trial this month.\n The Stroz report was kept sealed for months as Uber fought to keep it private. Waymo is using the report\u2019s inclusion into the record to show Uber was aware of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s actions. Waymo has asked for the court to postpone the trial, scheduled for Oct. 10, as it looks into the report and other recent disclosures from Uber.\n Interested in All Things Tech? The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.\n But the report does not appear to clearly answer a main question in the case: Whether or not Uber used any of the designs or technology Mr. Levandowski took with him from Google in Uber\u2019s own self-driving car project.\nWhat the report details instead is a history of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s meeting with Uber executives while he was still employed at Google but suggesting working together in some capacity. Mr. Levandowski eventually partnered with Lior Ron, a Google colleague, and pitched the idea for Ottomotto to a group of Google employees over barbecues and a ski trip to Lake Tahoe. The pair convinced roughly a dozen of the Googlers to join their effort, and the group eventually split off from Google to start Ottomotto.\nAfter leaving Google, Mr. Levandowski said he found a data storage container in his house containing \u201csource code, design files, laser files, engineering documents, and software related to Google self-driving cars,\u201d according to the report, information that Mr. Levandowski said he downloaded as a matter of \u201chis departure from ordinary course of business.\u201d\nInvestigators also found evidence of photos of Google self-driving car designs, whiteboard sketches and pictures of hardware and electronic components stored on Mr. Levandowski\u2019s iPhone.\n\u201cThe Stroz Report unequivocally shows that, before it acquired his company, Uber knew Anthony Levandowski had a massive trove of confidential Waymo source code, design files, technical plans and other materials after leaving Google; that he stole information deliberately, and repeatedly accessed it after leaving Waymo; and that he tried to destroy the evidence of what he had done,\u201d said Johnny Luu, Waymo spokesman.\nMr. Levandowski has invoked the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination. He had previously asserted, after realizing what information he had from Google, that he took the data storage disks to a shredding facility to have them destroyed.\n\u201cEven after 60 hours of inspection of our facilities, source code, documents and computers \u2014 no Google material has been found at Uber,\u201d Matt Kallman, a spokesman for Uber, said in a statement.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "waymo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stroz friedberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lior ron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony levandowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt kallman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "levandowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnny luu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waymo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "waymo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lake tahoe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:01:26.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2bf30a3a8df21cf48f68e11a99fc1819f87671a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8BJ_iTY5.BKrnOSAWHaNnsnSRLS6oXDTN.HYxBxKE8x642ArmpAwtPcZ5NOv5OTzfjSEEmM7uTSHI8fSdNOd76sbu6dPKKWjlTYowKORe5y7feTtMyRJza", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/dealbook/index.html", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "DealBook - The New York Times", "title": "The Electric Future, Waymo Documents, Uber: DealBook Briefing", "title_full": "The Electric Future, Waymo Documents, Uber: DealBook Briefing - The New York Times", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.015, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/04/business/04db-newsletter/04db-newsletter-facebookJumbo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2bf30a3a8df21cf48f68e11a99fc1819f87671a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8BJ_iTY5.BKrnOSAWHaNnsnSRLS6oXDTN.HYxBxKE8x642ArmpAwtPcZ5NOv5OTzfjSEEmM7uTSHI8fSdNOd76sbu6dPKKWjlTYowKORe5y7feTtMyRJza", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AMIE TSANG", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Electric Future, Waymo Documents, Uber: DealBook Briefing", "text": " count=\"132\" data-total-count=\"132\">China has said it will eventually ban gasoline-powered cars.

But he cautioned that there was not enough evidence for many of the genetic claims being made about exercise and nutrition, and worried that many people would not be able to distinguish the services that are scientifically rigorous from those that are not. \u201cThere\u2019s this mixture of some that have real solid footing and then some that have zero footing,\u201d Dr. Topol said. Joel C. Eissenberg, a professor and associate dean in the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine, said that unlike some direct-to-consumer tests, like whole-body CT scans, which can expose consumers to potentially harmful radiation, personal genetic tests pose no risk of physical harm. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of the democratization of health care delivery, wherever it\u2019s not a risk for the patient,\u201d he said. A negative side effect from genomics testing is distress when people discover they have a mutation linked to a disease, studies have shown, though the anxiety tends to be short-lasting. In April, 23andMe received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to market the first direct-to-consumer genetic tests for 10 diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s, with no doctor involved. The company, however, does offer links to genetic counselors on its website for those who desire follow-up. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Unlike 23andMe, most companies require some sort of approval from a doctor for personal genetic tests. When customers order a test from Sema4 through Helix, for example, a physician \u201creviews their report, signs off on it, and then you\u2019re genetically counseled around that report,\u201d said Eric Schadt, the company\u2019s chief executive. Invitae has a similar protocol in place for its cardiac disease test. Customers will have to fill out a health questionnaire, and those with a strong family history of heart disease will be referred to a doctor for more in-depth diagnostic testing. \u201cYou have to have a physician involved in ordering this test,\u201d said Dr. Nussbaum, Invitae\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cBut it\u2019s really designed for the motivated and educated consumer to initiate the process.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on October 10, 2017, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Test Your Own Genetics, With Care.

Credit Courtesy of Amy Silverman I cracked at ToonTown. We had been at Disneyland for just two hours and this woman was staring at my younger daughter, Sophie, who was 3 at the time. Sophie has Down syndrome \u2014 and has always attracted attention, usually of the sidelong variety. But this was head-on. \u201cO.K.,\u201d I said to my husband, Ray, through clenched teeth. \u201cIf that woman doesn\u2019t stop staring at Sophie I\u2019m going to walk over and tell her: Yes. She has it. Why don\u2019t you take a picture?\u201d Ray looked at me, then at the woman, who was by then tending to several kids under 5. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really seem to me that she\u2019s staring at Sophie,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyhow, so what if she is? I always stare at people with Down syndrome.\u201d \n  It\u2019s true. He did. And so did I. Long and hard, any time I got the chance. In the checkout line at the grocery store, on the carousel at the mall. At the doctor\u2019s office. And definitely at Disneyland. For years, we\u2019ve made an annual family trip there and I\u2019ve looked forward to several things: the Peter Pan ride, a Mickey-shaped soft pretzel and some really good staring opportunities. I\u2019m not proud of my staring habit, but I don\u2019t mind admitting it. Even though about 6,000 babies with Down syndrome are born every year in the United States, and more and more people with the condition marked by an extra 21st chromosome are mainstreamed in society all the time, I just don\u2019t see people with Down syndrome out in public on a regular basis. Neither does Rosemarie Garland-Thomson. A professor of English and bioethics at Emory University in Atlanta, she wrote a 2009 book, \u201cStaring: How We Look,\u201d about why we stare at people who are different from us. She argues that people stare at people with physical and intellectual disabilities for many reasons \u2014 including to educate themselves about the unfamiliar. \u201cStares are urgent efforts to make the unknown known, to render legible something that seems at first glance incomprehensible,\u201d writes Dr. Garland-Thomson, who has a disability and has been on the receiving end of staring. Her own disability is not easy to describe, she said. \u201cMost of the time,\u201d she explained, \u201cI say I just have unusual hands and arms that I\u2019ve had since birth.\u201d Ultimately, Dr. Garland-Thomson told me when we talked, \u201cwhat we want is for there to be so many people with disabilities out and about in the public world that we become a completely unremarkable sight.\u201d For now, there\u2019s Disneyland. On that first trip to Disneyland when Sophie was 3, my husband and I spent three solid days staring. There was only one other child at Sophie\u2019s school with Down syndrome, and in our town in Arizona we weren\u2019t used to seeing other people exhibiting the gait and facial features that often characterize having an extra 21st chromosome. But Disneyland draws all kinds of people, and it seems to have a special magic for people with special needs; it\u2019s clean, contained, accessible and fun. And there always seem to be several people there with Down syndrome. Each time I\u2019d see someone with it, I\u2019d immediately project into the future, and imagine Sophie becoming that person. \n  At the end of our trip, Sophie and I went for a final spin on the carousel. I was so focused on getting her safely buckled in that I almost didn\u2019t notice the woman in the navy blue windbreaker. She was older than the others I\u2019d seen that week, her scrunched up face with a tiny nose and almond-shaped eyes unmistakable under a tangle of dark hair. Her face was beaming with rare joy. She ran past us and I lost track of her. The ride began and Sophie squawked, then laughed. I laughed, too. As we left the carousel, I hugged Sophie hard. I wanted to show Ray the woman in the navy windbreaker, but she was gone. Newsletter Sign Up Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

The house where I lived as a child was equally foreign, and seemed tiny, like a dollhouse.\nThe other side of this mild nostalgic angst is the joy of discovery: The privilege of being able to explore old stamping grounds with fresh eyes (and a few decades under the belt). That\u2019s exactly how I spent the better part of a week in Chicago, a city defined by its 77 distinctly demarcated community areas , which in turn houses dozens of additional neighborhoods, each with its own particular nuance and local spirit.\nI chose three \u2014 Beverly, as well as Lincoln Square and Roscoe Village \u2014 as the lenses through which I would rediscover the city that played such a large part of my childhood. The best part? Keeping expenses low without sacrificing enjoyment. My time in the Windy City, which included a historical walking tour, free dance classes and delicious food and drink, cost me a pittance.\nPhoto The gate to Lincoln Square in Chicago. Credit Michelle Litvin for The New York Times Lincoln Square I started in the northernmost destination of my Chicago adventure, the epicenter of which is where Western meets Lincoln and Lawrence Avenues. That confluence is made blessedly less hectic by Lincoln becoming a narrow one-way street, creating a small oasis in the city lined with businesses focused on serving the neighborhood as well as plenty of green spaces. A focus on local ownership \u201creally makes Lincoln Square feel like its own small town,\u201d said Elizabeth Bracken, a scenic designer and neighborhood resident I met through Barrel of Monkeys , a nonprofit theater we\u2019ve both worked with.\n Cafe Selmarie , which opened in 1983 as a small bakery and coffee shop, has grown along with the neighborhood, which has come into its own as a destination for artists and young families. It\u2019s a cute, all-day cafe (closed Mondays) but the ideal time to pay a visit is burger nights on Wednesdays. I downed a thoroughly enjoyable burger dressed with Brie, bacon and caramelized onion, alongside a nutty, deep-amber Domaine DuPage French-style country ale, all for $15. I picked up a loaf of banana bread ($4.15) for the road, and wasn\u2019t disappointed.\n Nearby is Gene\u2019s Sausage Shop , a big, bright market and deli that\u2019s hiding a secret: a wonderful rooftop where you can enjoy different beers, wines and snacks. It was a secret to me, anyway. I arrived there one weekend to meet up with some friends and it was packed with hungry revelers enjoying a sunny, breezy afternoon. \u201cNumber 46!\u201d bellowed the young man behind the counter and I picked up my order of crispy potato pancakes ($6), S\u00e3o Paulo Sandwich ($9) and pasta salad ($3) to go along with a refreshing Wittekerke Belgian white beer ($6). I\u2019d recommend everything but the sandwich, which was a sad couple of pieces of fried mortadella and provolone cheese. The food (cash-only on the rooftop, by the way), though, is incidental \u2014 it\u2019s more about the good vibes and camaraderie of drinking on a rooftop with friends, and there was plenty of that to go around.\nOther highlights of that stretch include a cute toy store, Timeless Toys, with a weekly kids\u2019 story time, and a cozy book store called The Book Cellar . Beyond plenty of books and multiple events and readings every week, the independent seller has beverages, including beer and wine, to accompany your browsing. I got an iced coffee for $2.20.\nIf you\u2019re feeling crafty, it\u2019s worth stopping into the Gallimaufry Gallery , which has been run by Pat Rodarte and Michael Merkle for over 40 years (15 in its current location). They source pieces from artists both local and throughout the country. I picked up an attractive oversized market bag printed with a colorful map of Illinois for $19.50. \u201cIt\u2019s like a little hamlet,\u201d Ms. Rodarte said about the neighborhood. \u201cThe community is very supportive.\u201d (She was somewhat less glowing when our conversation turned to local politics.)\nFurther down Lincoln, past the beautiful old Davis Theater (where I caught a matinee showing of \u201cDunkirk\u201d one afternoon for $9), is the Old Town School of Folk Music . The Chicago arts institution, founded in 1957, has been in its Lincoln Square location since the \u201990s and has become the artistic hub of the community. Thousands attend the school\u2019s music classes every week \u2014 over half of them adults. From dulcimer to mandolin, from jazz to Celtic, Old Town casts a wide net.\nI was lucky enough to stumble in on National Dance Day and a series of free classes. I joined Boogie McClarin in his House Dance class and received an education in house culture, which has strong Chicago roots, as well as a good workout. \u201cFind whatever works for you: Find your Afro world house, or your vocal queer anthem house and listen to it!\u201d a smiling Ms. McClarin directed our class of about 25 people. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a 4/4 beat, any more than your heart beating is just expansion and contraction.\u201d Clad in a flowing, all-white outfit and with an eye-catching streak of blond in her black curls, the Chicago native then gave a couple dozen of us an invigorating crash course in movement.\nPhoto Shangri-La in Roscoe Village. Credit Michelle Litvin for The New York Times Roscoe Village I was energized enough to walk a mile and a half south to Roscoe Village. The \u201cvillage\u201d in the name says a lot; on the train overpass at the Ravenswood intersection are painted the words \u201cThe Village Within the City.\u201d Its main drag, along Roscoe Street between Western and Ravenswood Avenues, is less than a mile and can be traversed in about 10 minutes \u2014 past small businesses, cute wood-framed and brick houses and plenty of families and pets strolling the main commercial drag. A self-guided garden walk (organized by the neighborhood association), where locals opened up their backyards to curious wanderers with green thumbs, was a great way to explore the area by foot.\n5 miles\nLincoln Square\n90\nRoscoe Village\nLake\nMichigan\nChicago\nILLINOIS\nBeverly\nINDIANA\n57\nOCT. 4, 2017\nBy The New York Times Those small businesses include some great vintage and thrift shopping. Shangri-La Vintage gives a sense, unlike many other stores I\u2019ve visited, of actually being carefully curated by the owner. \u201cWe\u2019re dressing up like the \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 kids for ComiCon!\u201d one shopper explained as she was pawing through some \u201970s- and \u201980s-era shirts. I found a great Chicago Bulls hat from the glory days of the late \u201990s for $13.\nFor those on a slightly tighter budget, and with a lot more patience, there\u2019s Village Discount Outlet just down the street. While sections of the store looked like an earthquake had hit it, there are treasures and deals to be found throughout the considerable sprawl. I needed a pair of athletic shorts, and picked up one for a few bucks.\n There\u2019s quality sustenance to be found, too, when you need a break from shopping and garden-hopping. Turquoise Restaurant was marred by slow and indifferent service when I visited with my family but offered an incredible deal on brunch. For $20, diners get fresh bread served with honey and butter, hash browns, two kinds of omelets, sucuk (Turkish sausage) with eggs, meatballs, a cheese platter, crepes and fresh fruit. It\u2019s an astounding amount of food, most of it quite good, so come hungry. (Did I mention you get tea or coffee, too?)\nIf you\u2019re in the mood to go in a slightly different direction, The Region offers Northwest Indiana-style hamburgers \u2014 a style I wasn\u2019t even aware existed. The distinguishing characteristic is that the burger is pressed thin on the hot griddle until its edges become crispy and caramelized. The 4-ounce Regionette ($5.50; a 7-ouncer is $8.50) made me wish I\u2019d found out about this style sooner. The chili cheese fries ($5.50) with homemade chili were a delectable mess.\nPhoto Janson\u2019s Drive-In in Beverly. Credit Michelle Litvin for The New York Times Beverly That wasn\u2019t the only revelation of the trip. When I went down to 95th Street to explore my old Beverly neighborhood, the discoveries kept coming. The Purple Cow, a bovine-themed ice cream parlor I remember as a favorite birthday party destination for neighborhood kids, was long gone. But Top Notch Beefburgers , opened in 1942, was still alive and kicking; the $5.67 cheeseburger with a thick slice of tomato and raw onion hit the spot.\nI was also happy to see that Rainbow Cone , another South Side institution, opened by the Sapp family in 1926, was still scooping their signature multichromatic treats. The colorful orange sherbet, pistachio, chocolate, strawberry, and Palmer House (vanilla with cherries and walnuts) cones are reason enough to make the trek south. (Don\u2019t go in the winter, though \u2014 they close for the season.) A large cone ran me $5.39.\nPhoto A house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in Beverly. Credit Michelle Litvin for The New York Times The best discovery, though, was a wealth of architectural gems and beautiful homes I was too young to appreciate (or even notice) as a child. On Longwood Drive, Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Raymond W. Evans house lords over the area atop a modest hill. The 1908 Prairie School structure (and its neighbors) are well worth a peek \u2014 just be respectful as it is a private residence.\nI found a wealth of local architectural information at the Ridge Historical Society on South Seeley Avenue. The Tudor Revival-style Graver-Driscoll house, in which the Society is located, is worth checking out in its own right. But the real find was a copy of a hand-scrawled architectural tour, available in printouts on oversized pieces of paper. I spent the better part of an afternoon exploring not just the Frank Lloyd Wright landmarks (the H. Howard Hyde and Guy C. Smith houses on South Hoyne Avenue) but also those of Walter Burley Griffin, a one-time Wright employee who designed the Australian city of Canberra. Griffin\u2019s Prairie School contributions are visible throughout the area, but are mostly focused on West 104 Place \u2014 a small street with at least a half-dozen structures bearing his design.\nMost eye-opening of all was the Vanderpoel Art Association , an astonishing (and free) assortment of American impressionist art crammed into a modest-sized room in the field house at Ridge Park. Full of day-campers and running kids, the rec building seemed an unlikely place to hold a priceless art collection, including works by Grant Wood, Ernest Hennings and John H. Vanderpoel himself. But, after straying into the gymnasium a couple of times, I finally found it: a plain room packed to the gills with striking art pieces.\nAlone, I pondered the works, and particularly enjoyed ones by Chicago artists like Wallace DeWolf and George Frederick Buehr. It was stunning \u2014 but not entirely surprising \u2014 that such treasures were modestly displayed and out in the open, available to all, yet scarcely noticed. It reminded me of Chicago itself, and why I\u2019ll always adore it.\n We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page.

Back Story Work began last week on prototypes of President Trump\u2019s proposed border wall with Mexico, but no matter how big or beautiful it might eventually be, a barrier in Australia would still be longer. The Dingo Fence stretches about 3,500 miles, from eastern Queensland to the South Australia coastline. (By comparison, the U.S.-Mexico border is less than 2,000 miles.) Unlike some of Australia\u2019s more gaudy \u201cbiggest things in the world\u201d (see: the pineapple; the prawn), the fence serves a purpose: to protect livestock from dingoes, the wild dogs that roam the continent. The fence stands about six feet tall, but it\u2019s easier to forgive its shortcomings when you realize that it was completed in 1885. Aside from the odd hole, the fence, made mostly of mesh, has served its purpose: Sheep and cattle are notably safer. As you\u2019d expect, a structure so large requires substantial (and expensive) upkeep. Maintenance and patrol workers are employed across the three states that it crosses. The farmers pay for it, of course. Adam Baidawi contributed reporting . Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated all morning. Browse past briefings here.

The number of unemployed stood at 133,200 in September, down 200 compared with August and 31,600 lower compared with a year ago, the Central Statistics Office said. Employment has grown strongly since the jobless rate peaked at 15.1 percent in 2012 when Ireland was midway through a three-year international bailout, and expanded at its fastest rate since the financial crisis in the first quarter of the year. Ireland's finance department forecasts that the unemployment rate will dip below 6 percent by the end of this year, meaning the economy could reach full employment next year with the rate forecast to remain at 5.5 percent from 2018 onwards.

Mohammad Javad Zarif's visit is likely to further inflame officials in Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which began their boycott nearly four months ago, on June 5. It also comes as a new academic survey published this week suggests that the average citizens in the Arab nations of the now-fractured Gulf Cooperation Council do not see Iran as an existential threat in the same way their leaders do. Zarif on Monday met with Omani officials, including Sultan Qaboos bin Said, who has ruled Oman since 1970 and has served as an interlocutor between the West and Iran. \nAdvertisement \"None of the regional crises have a military solution,\" Zarif said at the meeting, according to Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency. All sides should \"give priority to regional initiations for restoring collective stability and security.\" Qatari officials offered no immediate comment on the meeting. Qatar pulled its ambassador from Tehran in early 2016, after Saudi Arabia's execution of a prominent Shiite cleric sparked attacks on Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran. The pullout was a Qatar move offering solidarity with the kingdom, which has long expressed concerns over Doha's pursuit of its own maverick foreign policy supporting Islamists, as well as being the home of the Al-Jazeera satellite news network, which ranks among the Arab world's most influential TV channels. The boycotting nations have cut off land, sea and air routes to Qatar, a small peninsular nation that sticks out like a thumb in the Persian Gulf. In August, Qatar restored diplomatic ties after Iran sent food to Doha and allowed Qatari planes to increasingly use the Islamic Republic's airspace. Iran and Qatar have strong shared commercial interests, namely a massive offshore natural gas field, called the South Pars Field by Tehran and the North Field by Doha. That gas field's vast reserves have made Qataris have the highest per capita income in the world. Those reserves have also funded Al-Jazeera and helped secure hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Opt out or contact us anytime The crisis has split the hereditarily ruled nations of Gulf Cooperation Council, a regional bloc representing Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE that formed in part as a counterbalance to Iran. Kuwait has tried unsuccessfully to mediate the crisis, as has the United States, which has a major military base in Qatar. Leaders in the Sunni Arab countries of the Gulf, those in Saudi Arabia and the UAE especially, view Iran with suspicion after its advances on the battlefields of Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State group. They also worry about Iran's nuclear program and the 2015 deal that Tehran struck with world powers over it. But face-to-face surveys of over 4,000 GCC citizens conduced in recent months found that with the exception of Bahrain, the spread of extremist organizations like the Islamic State group and al-Qaida represented their biggest worry, said Justin Gengler, a senior researcher at the Social and Economic Survey Research Institute at Qatar University. Gengler said the survey, funded by the Qatar National Research Fund before the diplomatic crisis began and conducted along with researchers from the University of Michigan, was conducted in every GCC country except the UAE. Gengler first published his results Monday in Foreign Affairs. The margin of error was below 4 percent among the surveys in each country. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Asked about the results, Gengler said Iran offered a convenient foe for Gulf nations struggling with internal problems and low global oil prices. \"If it's not the case that people feel threatened militarily by Iran, how is it that governments continue to talk about it?\" Gengler told The Associated Press. \"At the end of the day in the Gulf, regime stability is the No. 1 priority guiding every decision rulers make. ... Elites have their objectives and citizens have their own priorities in daily life and they don't always match up.\" ___ Associated Press writer Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report. ___ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gengler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sultan qaboos bin said", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasser karimi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammad javad zarif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin gengler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zarif", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york times iran", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "university of michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al-jazeera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gcc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united arab emirates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social and economic survey research institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tasnim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al-qaida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf cooperation council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar national research fund", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "persian gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united arab emirates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bahrain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuwait", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:55:01.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "56c3761fcc5d5cea27a29c9c0a131b82486fde3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxxQbOF6qH5Z2saBKiR.hUcMf5gxJE7aATE.Jwo_NJFNcZ8_txuf5CmWlknCy_9rusMnGMmiskdSk-", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://nytimes.com/timeswire/feeds/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NYT > Most Recent Headlines", "title": "Onora O\u2019Neill Wins $1 Million Berggruen Prize for Philosophy", "title_full": "Onora O\u2019Neill Wins $1 Million Berggruen Prize for Philosophy", "published": "2017-10-03T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/03/arts/03berggruen-1506983577430/03berggruen-1506983577430-facebookJumbo.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4647, "comments": 0, "shares": 4647}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 23}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "56c3761fcc5d5cea27a29c9c0a131b82486fde3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxxQbOF6qH5Z2saBKiR.hUcMf5gxJE7aATE.Jwo_NJFNcZ8_txuf5CmWlknCy_9rusMnGMmiskdSk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JENNIFER SCHUESSLER", "published": "2017-10-03T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Onora O\u2019Neill Wins $1 Million Berggruen Prize for Philosophy", "text": " Photo The philosopher Onora O\u2019Neill, who received the Berggruen Prize for her thoughts on interpersonal trust, among other ideas. Credit Onora O'Neill The British philosopher Onora O\u2019Neill has been named the winner of the 2017 Berggruen Prize , which is awarded annually to a thinker whose ideas \u201chave profoundly shaped human self-understanding and advancement in a rapidly changing world.\u201d\nThe prize, which carries a cash award of $1 million, will be given in a ceremony in New York City in December. It was inaugurated last year by the Berggruen Institute , a research organization based in Los Angeles and dedicated to improving governance and mutual understanding across cultures, with particular emphasis on intellectual exchange between the West and Asia.\nMs. O\u2019Neill, 76, is known for her work in ethics, which builds on the work of Immanuel Kant. The prize jury, which was led by the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah, praised her for providing insight on \u201cthe central questions of our time, from the tension between universal rights and national sovereignty to the role of interpersonal trust in enabling autonomy to the moral obligation to take action across borders to relieve famine.\u201d\nTrust, in particular, has been a major theme of Ms. O\u2019Neill\u2019s work, elaborated in scholarly works like \u201cJustice, Trust and Accountability\u201d (2005), as well as in a 2013 TED Talk called \u201cWhat We Don\u2019t Understand About Trust,\u201d which challenged the frequent call to \u201crebuild trust\u201d across society.\n\u201cFrankly, I think that\u2019s a stupid aim,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Neill said in that talk. \u201cI would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy. In fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy.\u201d The call to rebuild trust, she said, \u201cgets things backwards.\u201d\nThis is not the first major international prize for Ms. O\u2019Neill, a crossbench member of the House of Lords and a professor of philosophy at the University of Cambridge, who has also served as the chair of Britain\u2019s Equality and Human Rights Commission. She was the winner of this year\u2019s Holberg Prize , which is awarded by the Norwegian parliament and carries a cash prize of about $525,000. She also won the 2015 International Kant Prize.\nThe winner of last year\u2019s Berggruen Prize was the Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "berggruen priz", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "onora o\u2019neill", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "onora o'neill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "immanuel kant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o\u2019neill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kwame anthony appiah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "house of lords", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equality and human rights commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berggruen institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:03:21.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8fbb95891e39efb2cd68eb2c627d91cc3d59492", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxxQbOF6qH5Z3e347DlbbrZqDucXKSlnt04qqHYXfhenORHgiGw0emrKHqte_rsIaA2ywa9P7K50aLAbrbG8d1ZxsOw3F_uPC_", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://nytimes.com/timeswire/feeds/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NYT > Most Recent Headlines", "title": "California Today: No Easy Answers After Las Vegas", "title_full": "California Today: No Easy Answers After Las Vegas", "published": "2017-10-03T19:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/03/us/03California-Today-shooting/03California-Today-shooting-facebookJumbo.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 233, "comments": 0, "shares": 233}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 19}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f8fbb95891e39efb2cd68eb2c627d91cc3d59492", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxxQbOF6qH5Z3e347DlbbrZqDucXKSlnt04qqHYXfhenORHgiGw0emrKHqte_rsIaA2ywa9P7K50aLAbrbG8d1ZxsOw3F_uPC_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MIKE McPHATE", "published": "2017-10-03T19:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "California Today: No Easy Answers After Las Vegas", "text": " Mourners in Las Vegas attended a vigil Monday night for the victims of a mass shooting.

Davis.\nCreated with state funding in July, the center is aimed at bringing science to the gun violence debate by studying its underlying causes along with strategies of prevention.\nWe caught up with Dr. Wintemute, 65, by phone on Monday. Some excerpts:\nQ. What went through your mind when you saw the news out of Las Vegas?\nA. As always, my first experience is grief. I worked a shift in the [emergency department] yesterday. We never get used to this. We get used to not getting used to it.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story How do we stop it?\nThere isn\u2019t an easy answer. These events are all different and if we devise narrowly crafted policies to prevent the last one, we might not affect the next one.\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story There are some commonalities. One is that weapons designed to kill large numbers of people in a small period of time are more readily available than they should be.\nPhoto Garen Wintemute, an emergency room physician, directs research on gun violence at U.C. Davis. Credit Jos\u00e9 Luis Villegas/U.C. Davis Health Does California have the right mix of gun-control laws?\nNobody has it right.\nBut I will say California does have more stringent requirements than most states. Our homicide rates are below average. Our suicide rates are well below average. And beginning about 10 years ago, as rates across the country either stabilized or tended to drift up, California\u2019s have been drifting down.\nHow do you explain that?\nI suspect it\u2019s a lot of things. Some of them have nothing to do with guns. We have a pretty good health care system. We have a pretty good mental health care system. We have more economic equity than a lot of states have.\nThis is a fundamental point: preventing gun violence just by focusing on guns themselves won\u2019t be sufficient.\nDo shootings of the kind in Las Vegas take up too much oxygen in the gun debate?\nI have very mixed opinions. On the one hand, yes, they do take up the oxygen. They account for no more than one maybe two percent of all the deaths from firearm violence in the United States.\nBut the flip side is these events, for good or for ill, give people the sense of a personal stake in the issue. That can have effects in opposite directions. I suspect we will see a spike in gun purchasing after this shooting. But one hopes that people\u2019s increasing sense of personal risk will translate into effective action on the problem.\nWe just have to wait and see.\nThis interview was condensed and edited for clarity.\nThe Shooting in Las Vegas Photo The authorities said Rachael Parker, a records technician for the Manhattan Beach Police Department, was among those fatally shot in Las Vegas on Sunday night.

Until Sputnik, Washington hadn\u2019t considered how much propaganda value lay in science and technology. Credit Pravda/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images CHICAGO \u2014 On Oct. 4, 1957 \u2014 60 years ago \u2014 millions of bewildered Americans raised their heads to the sky to observe a moving object that looked like a star and appeared every 90 minutes. It was Sputnik, the first artificial earth satellite, launched that day by the Soviet Union. It opened a new era of space exploration and a new front in the Cold War. Its story begins in March 1950, when a group of American scientists decided to declare an International Geophysical Year to promote an exchange of ideas and discuss international scientific projects. The \u201cyear\u201d ran from July 1, 1957, to Dec. 31, 1958, because that was expected to be a period of a maximum solar activity. In July 1955, the Eisenhower administration announced that the American contribution to the effort would be launching several small, earth-orbiting satellites. Four days later, the Soviets announced that they, too, would launch a satellite soon. Within a month, Moscow had a commission developing a program that would beat the Americans into orbit. Washington may not have realized it yet, but the space race had just begun. Focused on maintaining an edge in the military application of rocket science, the Eisenhower administration had little interest in a satellite launch and considered it a purely scientific affair. It proceeded cautiously, studying the legality of a satellite flight over Soviet territory and avoiding the use of military rockets to avoid giving Moscow any pretext for accusing the United States of a provocation. As a result, the administration chose the untried Vanguard rocket, designed for research launches, rather than a tested Jupiter-C military rocket. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The Soviets had no such restraints and quickly understood the propaganda value of such a launch. In contrast to Washington, Moscow quickly prioritized the launch, devoted enormous resources to the project \u2014 and made the space program a closely guarded state secret. An initial design for a more ambitious satellite with several scientific instruments aboard proved too much of a challenge, and the Soviets moved toward developing the simplest possible satellite. Continue reading the main story The original launch was scheduled for April 1958. But when it became known that the Americans were scheduled to make public a paper titled \u201cSatellite Over the Planet\u201d at the International Geophysical Year conference in Washington on Oct. 6, 1957, the Soviets assumed that the Americans would launch their satellite a few days ahead of the gathering.

On Oct. 4, despite a touch-and-go launch with some nerve-racking malfunctions, the Soviet rocket lifted off and placed the first artificial satellite into the earth\u2019s orbit. Sputnik (\u201csatellite\u201d in Russian) was a small ball about two feet in diameter and weighing less than 200 pounds. It was equipped with a radio transmitter emitting distinct beeping sounds that quickly captured the attention of the entire world. In particular, it was a wake-up call for the United States. The Soviets had kept their intentions secret to the very end. On the day of the launch, the Soviet Embassy in Washington held a reception for the participants of the international conference aimed at coordinating the satellite launches. During the reception, the head of the American delegation suddenly announced that The New York Times had just informed him that a satellite had been sent into orbit. He congratulated his Soviet colleagues, who had broken into triumphal wide grins when just a moment earlier they had professed ignorance of any Soviet launch. President Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s response was to expedite the original project, still relying on nonmilitary rockets. On Dec. 6, 1957, the first rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., but two seconds later lost thrust and fell back ignominiously. Only after the Eisenhower administration switched back to a more reliable military rocket was the first American satellite launched into orbit on Jan. 31, 1958. Named Explorer 1, it carried several scientific instruments and weighed just over 30 pounds. Washington always had realized that the Cold War was more than a military competition. But before Sputnik, it hadn\u2019t figured on how much propaganda value lay in science and technology. Sputnik changed that. In April 1958, Eisenhower recommended to Congress the establishment of a civilian agency for the nonmilitary use of space. Several months later, Congress, led by Lyndon Johnson, the Senate majority leader and future president, established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In the same year, it passed the National Defense Education Act, which provided low-interest loans to students majoring in math and the sciences. The Cold War competition in science, civilian technology and education was in full flight. Six decades after Sputnik, and after a short pause during the 1990s, Moscow has resumed its Cold War tactics. No longer able to compete with America in science and technology, Russia now deploys the American-conceived internet and its social platforms for the same nefarious purpose \u2014 subverting Western democracies. America\u2019s response in 1957 was a huge investment in space technologies; within 12 years, it had put the first men on the moon. Today, too, a major investment in cybersecurity by a much wealthier and more innovative West might remind Moscow that it cannot afford or win a digital information war, just as it could not, in the long run, win \u2014 or afford \u2014 a space race. \nMichael Khodarkovsky, a professor of history at Loyola University Chicago, is at work on a book about Russia in the 20th century. \nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .

Podcast makers are trying to create an entirely new form \u2014 one that needs to train kids and parents to follow entirely new family traditions. Sticking a kid in front of the morning cartoons may carry a whiff of stigma now, but it\u2019s just as easy as it ever was. Also, it\u2019s free. Partly because children\u2019s podcast creators are claiming the moral high ground on screen time, advertising is controversial for the medium. Pinna is charging $7.99 a month for its ad-free offerings. Whether parents will pay up remains to be seen. Photo The favorite podcast of Donshea Hopkins, pictured here during a taping of \u201cThe Ghost of Jessica Majors,\u201d is Neil deGrasse Tyson\u2019s \u201cStarTalk.\u201d Credit Bryan Anselm for The New York Times Andy Bowers, Panoply\u2019s chief content officer, has been puzzling over how to turn children\u2019s audio into a sustainable enterprise for a couple of decades. Before he created Slate\u2019s podcast network and spun it off into its own business, Panoply, he spent 17 years in public radio, where he tried unsuccessfully to evangelize for kids\u2019 programming. The conventional wisdom for radio stations was to stick with just one format \u2014 music or news. Producers were loath to abandon their dedicated adult audiences and try to wrangle children in front of the radio for an hour a day. So in 2005, just as the podcast was emerging as a form, Mr. Bowers started his own homemade kids\u2019 show with his 5-year-old daughter, Emma, taping episodes in a closet of their house. \u201cMolly and the Sugar Monster\u201d is a charming a bit of reverse psychology: It features Mr. Bowers as an ornery monster who urges kids to eat junk food, and Emma as a wily kid who taunts him with tales of her vegetable consumption until he explodes in frustration. Now the series has found a home on Pinna, where it\u2019s been packaged along with a trove of exclusive audio content. Emma Bowers, now 17, collaborated with Mr. Bowers on an original \u201csound picture book\u201d for the app, \u201cKid Wash,\u201d which used a binaural recording system \u2014 a mold of a human head outfitted with microphones \u2014 to create a 3-D listening experience that feels unlike anything children can read or watch. In addition to snackable audio for younger children, Pinna offers longer, serialized narratives like \u201cRemy\u2019s Place,\u201d an \u201cEloise\u201d-style series about a boy who lives above a Brooklyn juke joint (created by \u201cBlue\u2019s Clues\u201d composer Michael Rubin), and \u201cSeason Isle,\u201d a fantasy series about twins living on an enchanted island. Pinna also snagged Gen-Z Media\u2019s follow-up to \u201cMars Patel,\u201d the paranormal mystery \u201c The Ghost of Jessica Majors .\u201d \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Nonfiction content includes the kid\u2019s trivia game show \u201cExtraBLURT,\u201d the sports talk show \u201cGood Sport!\u201d and \u201cThe Show About Science.\u201d Come November, Pinna will debut a choose-your-own-adventure podcast and, in December, a series styled like an advent calendar, with an episode dropping each day leading up to Christmas. Podcasts creators aren\u2019t just selling content; they\u2019re pitching a lifestyle shift. \u201cBecause kids weren\u2019t valued as an audience in radio, I think there\u2019s an assumption that kids don\u2019t listen to audio, or they can\u2019t stay engaged by it,\u201d said Lindsay Patterson, co-chair of Kids Listen and the host of the children\u2019s science podcast Tumble . Even NPR\u2019s first podcast for kids, \u201c Wow in the World ,\u201d was personally financed by its hosts, Mr. Raz and Mindy Thomas, who record the show on nights and weekends in Ms. Thomas\u2019s basement studio in Fairfax, Va. (It\u2019s paid off: Since its launch in May, \u201cWow and the World\u201d has sat at the top of podcast rankings for kid and family content , racking up more than 3.6 million downloads.) \u201c The Unexplainable Disappearance of Mars Patel ,\u201d which debuted last year, was the \u201cSerial\u201d of children\u2019s podcasts and proved that serialized audio narratives could catch on among younger audiences. Photo Rileigh McDonald plays the titular character in \u201cThe Ghost of Jessica Majors.\u201d Credit Bryan Anselm for The New York Times Podcast makers are hoping that as more and better content is made available, audio listening will become another family ritual, like reading books at bedtime or listening to kids\u2019 albums in the car. One of Pinna\u2019s marketing pitches is an attempt to establish new habits: \u201cIt\u2019s for car time, play time, family time, chore time, bed time, any time.\u201d But unlike with YouTube channels or mobile games, children don\u2019t yet have an easy way to discover podcasts on their own. Even the \u201cKids & Family\u201d section of iTunes is peppered with often-inappropriate content for couples and parents. Dedicated apps for children\u2019s podcasts \u2014 in addition to Pinna, Kids Listen offers its own app for surfacing children\u2019s content, as does a new app called Leela Kids \u2014 seeks to streamline that discovery process. \u201cFour-year-olds, these days, will be very fluent in their use of the app,\u201d Ms. Shapiro said. To help encourage the new habit, podcasters are leaning on some light shaming. As Matt Lieber, co-founder of the podcast company Gimlet Media, said at a panel on the state of podcasting last year, \u201cThe guilt of a parent who puts the television on to pacify their children is one of the most powerful emotional forces in existence.\u201d (Gimlet, too, has a show for kids in the works.) Mr. Raz and Ms. Thomas have started their own company, Tinkercast , to expand their podcasting brand under the tagline: \u201cEyes Up. Screens Down. Jaws Dropped.\u201d Panoply bills Pinna as \u201cScreen free. Ad free. Guilt free.\u201d It\u2019s a tantalizing idea: a technological fix that feels like a throwback. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is not groundbreaking,\u201d Mr. Raz said. \u201cThis is old-fashioned, old-school technology.\u201d Partly because kids\u2019 podcasts are trying to situate themselves as a more virtuous alternative to screen time, advertising to kids is a sticky issue. In the grown-up world, podcasters typically appeal to advertisers with boundless editorial flexibility; marketing pitches are often written, produced and performed by the hosts themselves. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But research suggests that children respond to ads differently than adults do; they are less likely to differentiate between ads and other forms of entertainment, and they implicitly trust marketers\u2019 claims. \u201cYou just can\u2019t shove as much advertising into a kids\u2019 show as you can into a show for adults,\u201d said Ms. Patterson of Kids Listen. \u201cToo many ads will turn parents off.\u201d On \u201cWow in the World,\u201d Mr. Raz and Ms. Thomas have opted to aim commercials at the parents who are listening in. Before a break, a child\u2019s voice announces: \u201cGrown-ups, this message is for you,\u201d and then an adult voice-over artist reads ads for parent stuff like a meal-kit service or a sock start-up. Meanwhile, Panoply is hoping that parents will pay $7.99 a month for the ad-free Pinna. \u201cI just think it\u2019s coercive,\u201d said Mr. Bowers of advertising to kids. To reach a broader audience, Pinna will also offer select episodes of its shows for free; those won\u2019t have ads, either. If podcasters manage to capture the kids\u2019 market, they stand to create podcast listeners for life. James Kee, the 7-year-old fan of \u201cWow in the World\u201d, has already started branching out to more advanced fare. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to a little bit of \u2018Pod Save America,\u2019\u201d he said. \nFollow Amanda Hess on Twitter @amandahess .

Credit Rick Diamond/Getty Images This article has been updated to reflect news developments.\nI\u2019ve been a gun-control activist for 20 years. Every time I speak out on the need for stricter gun laws, I get a new profusion of threats. There\u2019s always plenty of the garden-variety \u201cyour dad would be ashamed of you\u201d sexist nonsense, along with the much more menacing threats to my family and personal safety.\nLast year, I performed at the Concert Across America to End Gun Violence with Jackson Browne, Eddie Vedder, Marc Cohn and the Harlem Gospel Choir, and we got death threats. People wanted to kill us because we wanted to end gun violence. That\u2019s where we are: America, 2017.\nFor the past few decades, the National Rifle Association has increasingly nurtured an alliance with country music artists and their fans. You can see it in \u201c N.R.A. Country ,\u201d which promotes the artists who support the philosophical, and perhaps economic, thrall of the N.R.A., with the pernicious tag line \u201cCelebrate the Lifestyle.\u201d\nThat wholesome public relations veneer masks something deeply sinister and profoundly destructive. There is no other way to say this: The N.R.A. funds domestic terrorism.\n A shadow government exists in the world of gun sales, and the people who write gun regulations are the very people who profit from gun sales. The N.R.A. would like to keep it that way.\n The laws we have in place to prevent the procurement of military-style weapons by mentally ill citizens are laughable by the standards of any civilized society. But even those pathetic restrictions would be eased if the N.R.A. had its way. Just this week, the House of Representatives was scheduled to vote on a measure that would loosen restrictions on gun silencers and armor-piercing bullets (the vote was indefinitely postponed after the Las Vegas massacre). It\u2019s not hard to learn about how millions of N.R.A. dollars have spread throughout Congress to influence that vote.\n Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n If the proposed law had passed before the mass shooting in Las Vegas on Sunday, and the rifles in the assailant\u2019s hotel room had been fitted with silencers, one could safely assume that the death toll would be much, much higher. Those who ran from the concert and survived did so because they heard the gunfire. None of that matters to the N.R.A.\nI encourage more artists in country and American roots music to end your silence. It is no longer enough to separate yourself quietly. The laws the N.R.A. would pass are a threat to you, your fans, and to the concerts and festivals we enjoy.\nThe stakes are too high to not disavow collusion with the N.R.A. Pull apart the threads of patriotism and lax gun laws that it has so subtly and maliciously intertwined. They are not the same.\nI know you\u2019ll be bullied for speaking out. This is how they operate. Not everyone will like you for taking a stand. Let it roll off your back. Some people may burn your records or ask for refunds for tickets to your concerts. Whatever. Find the strength of moral conviction, even if it comes with a price tag, which it will. Don\u2019t let them bully you into silence. That\u2019s where their power lies \u2014 in the silence of rational voices and in the apathy of those who can speak truth to power.\nThis is a moment in American history that can\u2019t be met with silence. According to PolitiFact , from 2005 to 2015, some 300,000 people were killed by gun violence. That\u2019s roughly the population of Pittsburgh. The grief that extends through the affected families is endless.\nThose of us who make our living in \u201cthe tower of song,\u201d as Leonard Cohen so eloquently put it, must let our voices ring out. The N.R.A. will stick to its post-shooting playbook. It will say that we shouldn\u2019t \u201cpoliticize\u201d the Las Vegas carnage by talking about gun control at this time, and that this isn\u2019t about guns, it\u2019s about people, and that even more of us should be armed to protect ourselves. Enough.\nPatriotism and a belief in strong gun control are not antithetical. We need common-sense gun laws, and I hope my fellow occupants of the tower of song will join me in saying so.

Credit Jay Biggerstaff/USA Today Sports, via Reuters Heading into N.F.L. Week 5 , only one team stands undefeated: It\u2019s the Kansas City Chiefs, after their 29-20 win over the Redskins on Monday night.\nLast season, the Chiefs were 12-4, and the season before that 11-5. Still, their lack of postseason success (a playoff win in 2015 is their only one since 1993) makes it a little hard to think of them among the N.F.L. elite. Their last Super Bowl appearance came with Len Dawson under center.\nYou certainly cannot credit their record to beating up solely on patsies. The Chiefs stated a case for themselves in Week 1 with an upset of the Patriots in New England. Wins over the Eagles and Chargers followed before Monday\u2019s game. Pro Football Reference rates their schedule so far as the fourth toughest in the league.\nAlex Smith has led the way at quarterback. After years of reliability, if not excellence, he is having a career season so far at age 33. His adjusted yards per attempt figure is 10.1, ranking behind only Tom Brady; his previous high was 8.1.\n He is helped by not having yet thrown an interception. He leads the league in completion percentage (76), touchdown percentage (6.6), game winning drives (3), and quarterback rating (124.2). The numbers come in spite of his being sacked 16 times, second only to Carson Palmer of the Cardinals.\n SportRadar stats show that Smith has been uncanny when facing a blitz: 9-for-10, easily the best in the league, for 184 yards. He has mostly enjoyed throwing to the right so far, where he is 33-44 for 489 yards and four touchdowns, with Tyreek Hill a favorite target. Though still accurate going left, he tends to throw shorter that way and has just one TD.\nDrawing even more attention has been the astonishing rookie Kareem Hunt. On opening night , he tore up the Super Bowl champions for 246 yards from scrimmage, a record for a first career start. He has kept it up, and leads the league in rushing by more than 100 yards.\nNewsletter Sign Up\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

They won Monday night on a game winning 43-yard field goal by Harrison Butker, who was picked up from the Panthers\u2019 practice squad because of an injury to Cairo Santos.\nThe game ended on a strange note: The Redskins, trailing by 3 after the field goal, with four seconds left at their own 25, tried a desperate series of laterals hoping for a miracle touchdown. They fumbled, and Justin Houston ran in a touchdown to increase the Chiefs\u2019 margin to 9 with the clock at zero. No big deal, except to gamblers, who had wagered on either the Chiefs minus-7 or the Redskins plus-7.\n(Besides the disappointment of the loss, the Redskins got bad injury news: Cornerback Josh Norman has a rib injury and will miss several weeks.)\nThe Chiefs\u2019 win came after being down 10 points early. They also trailed the Patriots by 10 and the Eagles by 4.\nThe flip side of the Chiefs\u2019 success are the four teams that haven\u2019t yet won: a motley crew of the Browns, Chargers, Giants and 49ers. While of course not mathematically eliminated, they are already in deep trouble. At online bookmakers their Super Bowl odds range from 100-1 (Giants) to 1,000-1 (Browns and 49ers).\nDon\u2019t award this year\u2019s Super Bowl to the Chiefs yet. Most bookies are listing them as only third favorite behind the 2-2 Patriots and 3-1 Packers. And the records of the last unbeaten team in recent seasons are a mixed bag. In 2016, the Vikings were the last perfect team, winning their first five, but staggered to an 8-8 record. In 2015, the Panthers won 14 in a row to start the season, then lost in the Super Bowl to the Broncos. And who remembers that 2014\u2019s last unbeaten was the Bengals?

Credit Yahya Arhab/European Pressphoto Agency Last month marked the third anniversary of the war in Yemen. In September 2014, rebel forces from Yemen\u2019s Houthi community abandoned a transitional political process in Yemen that was sponsored by the Gulf Cooperation Council and the United Nations. The mediation had begun after a 2011 uprising toppled President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who had ruled Yemen with an iron fist for more than three decades. Instead of continuing to talk, the rebels overran Amran, a city in northwest Yemen, and occupied the capital, Sana. They held hostage Mr. Saleh\u2019s transitional successor, President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, and effectively took over all government functions. When President Hadi managed to flee for his life, the rebels chased him to Aden and ultimately forced him to seek refuge and help from Saudi Arabia. Six months later, in March 2015, a coalition of nations led by Saudi Arabia started military operations with the goals of restoring the legitimate government of Yemen and reopening peaceful negotiations between it and the Houthis. A month later, the United Nations Security Council issued Resolution 2216, calling for the restoration of the government of President Hadi, the withdrawal of Houthi forces from Sana and other cities, and the handover of all heavy weapons to Yemen\u2019s Army. The resolution also called for the resumption of the transitional political process. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Three years later, the situation in Yemen remains appalling. In the face of the worldwide condemnation declared in Resolution 2216, and with cholera and famine inflicting unimaginable suffering on the Yemeni people, the Houthis and their allies, who are supplied by Iran, remain defiant and insist on retaining their unlawful hold on power. Continue reading the main story Efforts by the United Nations envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed to bring about peace and resume the peaceful political evolution that started in 2011 remain stalled. Civilians continue to bear the brunt of the war. While the coalition forces have exercised maximum vigilance in their conduct of the air campaign, collateral damage inevitably takes place, aggravating the problems caused by famine and cholera. At the same time, the Houthis continue their relentless shelling of civilian targets, their recruitment of child soldiers and their frequent missile attacks against Saudi territory.

You are already subscribed to this email. Opt out or contact us anytime Throughout the world, concerned and sincere people are asking: What if the guns fell silent in Yemen? Wouldn\u2019t we all be happy that peace had prevailed in this desperate land? I wish I could say yes, but that question assumes the first of three fallacies about Yemen. If a cease-fire was implemented in Yemen, unconditionally and indefinitely, it would effectively consolidate the de facto partition of Yemen. We would have a theocratic regime modeled on Iran in the north, with a Hezbollah-type militia holding the reins of power. That part of Yemen would be isolated, at odds with Saudi Arabia, its biggest neighbor, and out of step with the region to which it claims to belong. And in southern Yemen, a weak government would take over, giving Al Qaeda and Daesh, another name for the Islamic State, a chance to expand and take root. This part of Yemen would be deprived of natural and human resources, the bulk of which lie in the North. This is not a recipe for sustained peace. A cease-fire without full implementation of Resolution 2216, which aims to establish democracy in a federally united Yemen, would be only a pause before a more violent phase of the conflict erupts. What if all parties came together and sat around a table to negotiate their differences? Wouldn\u2019t that be nice? Of course it would; however, this second fallacy ignores the fact that we have had no shortage of talks. We have had direct talks, indirect talks, public talks, private talks \u2014 talks in Yemen, in Saudi Arabia, in Oman, in Switzerland and for more than 100 days in Kuwait. We have had plenty of talks. The missing ingredient in all of them has been political will on the part of the Houthis to share power, hand over heavy weapons and withdraw from the capital and other major cities. The Houthis, unfortunately, are guided by mystical beliefs that power must be held by a specific dynasty. It is the same belief that concentrates power in the hands of the supreme leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran and that brought the Houthis to war six times in the past decade against Yemen\u2019s central government. The third fallacy is the assumption that Yemen is cholera-infested and famine-threatened. Yes, there is cholera, and yes there are famine-like conditions; but they are concentrated in an area, no larger than 20 percent of Yemeni territory, that is controlled by the Houthis. The problem in this area arises more from failures of management and distribution than from any lack of available humanitarian aid and supplies. The Houthis refuse to use all of the ports available there or the roads for the transfer of aid. They have even stopped paying salaries to doctors, nurses and civil servants in areas under their control. So where do we go from here? Three simple steps are needed. The international community must insist on the full and immediate implementation of Resolution 2216. Iran must refrain from supplying weapons and materials to the Houthis. Humanitarian aid must be given unfettered access to all parts of Yemen, and access should be granted to the thousands of volunteers who are ready to risk their lives to save the lives of the proud and long-suffering Yemeni people. The road to peace in Yemen is clear. The Houthis must choose between being an outlaw militia group or a legitimate political party. If they choose the second option, they would have a place at the negotiating table and in government. They could contest the forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections. But at the same time, they would have to withdraw from Sana, hand over their heavy weapons to the national army and engage seriously in negotiations leading to a peaceful transition to a political solution for a united Yemen. \nAbdallah Y.

The company previously said that an unpatched software flaw had been to blame for the massive security breach, but on Tuesday, Mr. Smith went a step further, describing the \u201chuman error and technology failures\u201d that turned a single oversight into a data breach that allowed attackers to obtain personal details on nearly half of America\u2019s population .

Credit Susana Vera/Reuters There was uncertainty about whether Mr. Puigdemont would unilaterally declare Catalonia\u2019s independence, a move that would raise tensions even further. Separatist leaders did not react immediately to the Felipe\u2019s message on Tuesday evening, which carried an implicit warning that Madrid could take full control of Catalonia if separatists pushed their civil disobedience further. Felipe\u2019s intervention, while unlikely to smooth relations between Madrid and Barcelona, could help rally Spain\u2019s opposition parties around Mr. Rajoy, at a time when the Socialists have been ambivalent about how far the crackdown on Catalonia\u2019s government should stretch. The Catalan government announced that the independence referendum had been approved by 90 percent of almost 2.3 million voters, but it said that it would await complete returns before declaring the final result. The preliminary figures could not be independently confirmed, and further doubt will be cast on the meaningfulness of the result because the referendum was held without an agreed census \u2014 making it unclear how many people were entitled to vote \u2014 and because most of Catalonia\u2019s electorate did not take part. Madrid had asked potential voters to boycott the referendum. \nFollow Raphael Minder on Twitter @RaphaelMinder .

Since he began this kind of production \u2014 building carousels, bistros and airplane terminals (and, last season, a rocket that took off ) \u2014 guests have ogled and chafed and debated: Is this the grossest expression of fashion\u2019s self-involvement, or a genuine moment of escapism, proffered by one who can? Is it an example of extreme bombast or generosity?\nContinue reading the main story Photo Giambattista Valli, spring 2018.

And roses.\nNot just at Chanel, where Mr. Lagerfeld flounced chiffon and crinolines and lacy white blouses, but also at Giambattista Valli, where ultra-minis had a cancan kick and an interesting partner in cotton shirting and shrunken knit vests (an opposites-attract approach that is new for Mr. Valli), and dresses floated flower-strewn to the floor. And at Alexander McQueen.\nThere are exceptions, of course, most notably Herm\u00e8s, where the work of the designer Nad\u00e8ge Vanhee-Cybulski is generally an exception to every trend, just as the brand positions itself beyond fad \u2014 for spring, she was preoccupied by plaid (also known as tartan, and madras), in assorted perpendicular lines \u2014 but generally the Pavlovian cues of romance or perhaps wishful thinking are in the ascendant.\nContinue reading the main story Photo Alexander McQueen, spring 2018.

Who is the italicized she of Lily Tuck\u2019s clever new novel, \u201cSisters\u201d? As the object of the unnamed narrator\u2019s fixed regard, she has consumed the identity of her beholder to the point that the narrator defines herself in opposition to a woman she believes to be her sexual rival: her husband\u2019s ex-wife. She is \u201cblond, fair-skinned, big boned.\u201d An accomplished classical pianist, she likes cats. By contrast, the narrator describes herself as \u201cdark and petite,\u201d a dog person with a \u201ctin ear.\u201d Driven by jealousy, the narrator stalks her husband\u2019s ex-wife and mother of his two children, making silent phone calls from untraceable numbers, inventing reasons to \u201ctake the crosstown bus to shop in her neighborhood,\u201d extracting whatever information she can from the teenage son and daughter, who divide their time between their mother\u2019s and stepmother\u2019s households. With few opportunities to observe her prey directly, she obsessively sifts through what passes for tangential evidence, looking for means of penetrating the woman who, the narrator calculates, has had sex with her husband about 2,000 times. A recipe, a book about mathematics, the kind of wood used to make clogs, a Bertolucci film, a realtor\u2019s description of a castle for rent in Dordogne, \u201cChopin\u2019s Nocturne in F Sharp Major, Op. 15, No. 2\u201d \u2014 can any of these inform the frustrated voyeur? Underlying her entire narrative is a question she can\u2019t bring herself to ask out loud: Whom does her husband love best, his first or second wife? Photo Clues abound. As do red herrings. Having learned that she spent two years studying at \u201cone of the most competitive and storied piano performance departments in the world,\u201d the narrator questions a former classmate and finds out esoteric information of interest only to a stalker. She also discovers the names of her rival\u2019s illustrious mentors, Eleanor Sokoloff and Seymour Lipkin, the latter whose career the narrator subsequently follows. Upon discovering Lipkin\u2019s obituary, she resists calling her nemesis to ask if she knows her old teacher is dead, and instead goes to YouTube to watch and re-watch a video of the 86-year-old maestro performing Chopin. Artists and muses who suffered love affairs splintered by infidelity are summoned to bear witness to the narrator\u2019s obsession: Auguste Rodin and his mistress Camille Claudel; Vaclav Havel and his wife, Olga Splichalova; Simone de Beauvoir and Nelson Algren (after whom she has named her two cats). Pertinent works of literature are revisited in the hopes they may cast light on the narrator\u2019s position. Recounting a nightmare, she takes the opportunity to reflect that she did not, like the narrator of Daphne du Maurier\u2019s \u201cRebecca,\u201d dream that she \u201cwent back to Manderley,\u201d a reference to the first line of a gothic novel also told from the point of view of an unnamed second wife.

In more unequal societies, the disadvantaged will have less access to many of the things that improve productivity, like education, health and the internet. Rising inequality can hamper consumption by weighing on the income of the middle class . Douglas W. Elmendorf, former head of the Congressional Budget Office and now dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, once said that to assess the macroeconomic impact of cutting taxes and spending, it is indispensable to assess which taxes are cut and what spending is affected. \u201cMajor changes to benefits for lower-income people could have notable effects on the economy by altering labor supply, and those effects could be an important criterion in evaluating such changes,\u201d he argued. In more unequal societies, the rich have more power to distort policy making to channel more of the fruits of growth in their direction by, say, cutting taxes and government spending that might improve productivity and growth. Politics becomes more polarized . And it becomes more difficult to recover from economic shocks: Citizens in unequal societies are less likely to buy government promises that sacrifice today will lead to gains tomorrow. \u201cWe have not paid enough attention to macro distributional linkages,\u201d said Jonathan D. Ostry, deputy head of research at the International Monetary Fund, who has published groundbreaking research linking inequality and growth. \u201cEven if you are only interested in the aggregate gains, you are forced to think about equity, because equity matters for the aggregate. The distribution might come back to bite you.\u201d Mr. Laffer may still be calling to cut tax rates, to provide an incentive for executives to earn even more. But tax policy today calls for a new napkin, one with a place for equity. Correction: October 3, 2017 An earlier version of this column rendered one word incorrectly in a quotation from Jonathan D. Ostry of the International Monetary Fund.

Credit Carlos Barria/Reuters WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday expelled 15 Cuban diplomats, escalating his response to a mysterious affliction that has stricken American Embassy personnel in Havana in a move that cast a Cold War chill over relations between the two countries.\nThe order to the diplomats to leave the United States constituted the latest in a series of actions by Mr. Trump to unwind the d\u00e9tente between the United States and Cuba undertaken by his predecessor , President Barack Obama. Mr. Obama sought to end the hostility and mistrust that had characterized the relationship between the two countries for more than a half-century, and regarded the resumption in relations as one of his foreign policy legacies.\nThe Cuban government condemned what it called a \u201chasty, inappropriate and unthinking\u201d decision motivated by politics, and warned that the diplomatic dispute would sour relations already imperiled by Mr. Trump\u2019s move to crack down on travel and commerce with the island nation.\nThe State Department said the expulsion of the diplomats was intended to force Cuba to place its embassy in Washington, where the diplomats were stationed, on the same emergency status that the United States is now operating under in Havana after it decided last week to pare its staff there down to a skeletal group of just 27 people.\n Still, taken together with a policy directive that Mr. Trump issued in June and a State Department warning last week admonishing Americans not to travel to the island nation, the embassy drawdowns have the potential to freeze the normalization process in its tracks.\n They make it more difficult for citizens of both countries to engage with each other, imperiling already narrow channels of trade and commerce that opened after the 2014 rapprochement, and all but shutting down the immigration pipeline that allows Cubans to reunite with their families on American soil.\nA State Department official said the action did not signal a change in policy or an official determination that Cuba was responsible for the illnesses, which have confounded American investigators trying to locate their cause.\nBut the official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues, said the Cuban government had not done enough to protect Americans on its soil, and would need to ensure that the illnesses would not continue before personnel in either embassy could return.\nAmerican diplomats and their spouses began reporting symptoms that included hearing loss, dizziness, balance and visual problems, headaches and cognitive issues last December. By late January, the State Department realized that the illnesses were related and might have resulted from some sort of attack, perhaps by a sonic device , toxin or virus.\nThe number of personnel thought to have been affected has gradually grown over the months, and on Tuesday the State Department added one more to the list, bringing it to 22.\nIn a statement, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said the United States was expelling the Cuban diplomats \u201cdue to Cuba\u2019s failure to take appropriate steps to protect our diplomats in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention.\u201d Mr. Tillerson added that \u201cthis order will ensure equity in our respective diplomatic operations.\u201d\nIn a briefing with reporters Tuesday morning, a State Department official said the Cuban ambassador in Washington was informed of the expulsions in a 9 a.m. phone call from Francisco Palmieri, the top State Department official for the Western Hemisphere. The expelled embassy personnel were given seven days to leave the United States. The American Embassy in Havana will have completed its own drawdown by Friday.\n \u201cWe continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said, \u201cand will continue to cooperate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks.\u201d\nThe Cuban government accused the Trump administration of using the health crisis as an excuse to drive out Cuban diplomats without any proof that Havana was responsible. At a news conference in Havana, Bruno Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla, Cuba\u2019s foreign minister, said the move was \u201ceminently political\u201d as well as \u201cunwarranted and unjustifiable.\u201d\nNewsletter Sign Up Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy Opt out or contact us anytime Mr. Rodr\u00edguez faulted the American government for not reporting the ailments its diplomats suffered earlier to authorities in Cuba. The Cuban government, he said, has been denied access to the affected American personnel and the doctors who treated them, which has stymied Cuba\u2019s ability to help with the investigation.\n\u201cCuba has never perpetrated, and will never perpetrate, any type of attacks against diplomats or their relatives \u2014 no exception,\u201d Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said. Nor, he added, would it allow a third party to do so. He dismissed accounts of hearing loss and other symptoms as \u201cscience fiction.\u201d\nDaniel Erikson, who as a White House and State Department adviser on Latin America during the Obama administration was deeply involved in the 2014 rapprochement with Cuba, said the severe cutback in diplomats in Havana could blind the United States during Cuba\u2019s crucial political transition next year, when President Ra\u00fal Castro is expected to retire and a new generation of leaders take over.\n\u201cIt looks like what began as a legitimate effort to protect American diplomats from harm is moving to a broader breakdown in U.S.-Cuban relations,\u201d Mr. Erikson said.\nThe expulsions were cheered by opponents of the normalization, including members of the Cuban exile community, historically hostile to a Castro government, and condemned by supporters of warmer relations between Cuba and the United States, who said the move threatened to create a new chapter of hostility and play into the hands of those who wish to drive the two countries apart.\nIt would be especially damaging, proponents of engagement argued, if \u2014 as many current and former officials suspect \u2014 the Cuban government is not behind the attacks.\n \u201cIf this is not the government, but rather other forces seeking to undermine the U.S.-Cuba relationship, a permanent downgrade would accomplish that objective for them,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the former Obama administration deputy national security adviser who helped to negotiate the move toward normalization.\nBut Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a leading foe of closer relations between the two countries, said the expulsions were a fitting response to Cuba\u2019s misbehavior. He and other Republicans had called on Mr. Tillerson in a letter last month to go a step further, declaring all Cuban diplomats in the United States \u201cpersona non grata,\u201d a dramatic diplomatic stigma that results in banishment with no right to return.\n\u201cThe idea that over 20 American Embassy personnel could be severely injured in Cuba & the Cuban govt. not know about it is ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Rubio wrote Tuesday on Twitter.\nSome of those who were affected reported hearing odd sounds in particular rooms of their homes, leading some experts to speculate that some kind of sonic weapon or faulty surveillance device may have been at fault. F.B.I. agents investigating in Cuba have not been able to find the causes of the ailments.\nWith little hard evidence in hand, former American officials who follow Cuba closely have entertained a handful of theories that involve a third country, such as Russia \u2014 which would have an interest in driving a wedge between Cuba and the United States as the election approaches \u2014 or North Korea, which has en embassy in Havana. Neither scenario seems plausible without some level of Cuban government complicity, these officials say, considering how rigorously Cuba\u2019s intelligence service tracks diplomats on the island.\nThe administration expelled two low-level Cuban diplomats in May in response to the illnesses, but with more diplomats and their spouses becoming ill, calls grew on Capitol Hill for a more forceful response.\nIn the meantime, Mr. Trump in June announced he was \u201ccanceling the last administration\u2019s completely one-sided deal with Cuba,\u201d although the stricter travel and commercial regulations he ordered would fall well short of doing so, and have yet to materialize.\nCareer American diplomats leaving Havana expressed regret on Tuesday that their missions were coming to an end.\n\u201cI am an optimist and hope we will return one day, before too long,\u201d Scott Hamilton, the top American official in Cuba, wrote on Facebook. \u201cHasta la pr\u00f3xima, Cuba.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "heather nauert", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cuban diplomats from embassy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump administration", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "f.b.i.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cuba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "havana", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:14:12.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dcf3171710beaf06dc9378ca4fdef030a26208e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxxQbOF6qH5Z0NB45TyPV1nAyzbuzY0RrO60FZb6.ftBnRQR08mT0ZO_ZRwo5ZHz0YFEpornGVtHzN_.s2JuFLRQ--", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://nytimes.com/timeswire/feeds/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NYT > Most Recent Headlines", "title": "If Only Stephen Paddock Were a Muslim", "title_full": "If Only Stephen Paddock Were a Muslim", "published": "2017-10-03T21:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/04/opinion/04friedmanWeb/04friedmanWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dcf3171710beaf06dc9378ca4fdef030a26208e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxxQbOF6qH5Z0NB45TyPV1nAyzbuzY0RrO60FZb6.ftBnRQR08mT0ZO_ZRwo5ZHz0YFEpornGVtHzN_.s2JuFLRQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "THOMAS L.

Then Donald Trump would be tweeting every hour \u201cI told you so,\u201d as he does minutes after every terror attack in Europe, precisely to immediately politicize them. Then there would be immediate calls for a commission of inquiry to see what new laws we need to put in place to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again. Then we\u2019d be \u201cweighing all options\u201d against the country of origin.\nBut what happens when the country of origin is us?\nWhat happens when the killer was only a disturbed American armed to the teeth with military-style weapons that he bought legally or acquired easily because of us and our crazy lax gun laws?\n Then we know what happens: The president and the Republican Party go into overdrive to ensure that nothing happens. Then they insist \u2014 unlike with every ISIS-related terror attack \u2014 that the event must not be \u201cpoliticized\u201d by asking anyone, particularly themselves, to look in the mirror and rethink their opposition to common-sense gun laws.\n So let\u2019s review: We will turn the world upside down to track down the last Islamic State fighter in Syria \u2014 deploying B-52s, cruise missiles, F-15s, F-22s, F-35s and U-2s. We will ask our best young men and women to make the ultimate sacrifice to kill or capture every last terrorist. And how many Americans has the Islamic State killed in the Middle East? I forget. Is it 15 or 20? And our president never stops telling us that when it comes to ISIS, defeat is not an option, mercy is not on the menu, and he is so tough he even has a defense secretary nicknamed \u201cMad Dog.\u201d\nBut when fighting the N.R.A. \u2014 the National Rifle Association, which more than any other group has prevented the imposition of common-sense gun-control laws \u2014 victory is not an option, moderation is not on the menu and the president and the G.O.P. have no mad dogs, only pussycats.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

On asking the N.R.A. for even the tiniest moderation, they are AWOL. No matter how many innocents are fatally shot \u2014 no matter even that one of their own congressional leaders was critically wounded playing baseball \u2014 it\u2019s never time to discuss any serious policy measures to mitigate gun violence.\nAnd in the wake of last month\u2019s unprecedented hurricanes in the Atlantic \u2014 that wrought over $200 billion of damage on Houston and Puerto Rico, not to mention smaller cities \u2014 Scott Pruitt, Trump\u2019s head of the Environmental Protection Agency, also told us that it was not the time to discuss \u201cthe cause and effect\u201d of these superstorms and how to mitigate their damage. We need to focus on helping the victims, he said. But for Pruitt, we know, it\u2019s never time to take climate change seriously.\nTo take ISIS seriously abroad, but then to do nothing to mitigate these other real threats to our backyards, concert venues and coastal cities, is utter madness.\nIt\u2019s also corrupt. Because it\u2019s driven by money and greed \u2014 by gunmakers and gun sellers and oil and coal companies, and all the legislators and regulators they\u2019ve bought and paid to keep silent. They know full well most Americans don\u2019t want to take away people\u2019s rights to hunt or defend themselves. All we want to take away is the right of someone to amass a military arsenal at home and in a hotel room and use it on innocent Americans when some crazy rage wells up inside him. But the N.R.A. has these cowardly legislators in a choke hold.\n What to do?\nForget about persuading these legislators. They are not confused or underinformed. They are either bought or intimidated. Because no honest and decent American lawmaker would look at Las Vegas and Puerto Rico today and say, \u201cI think the smartest and most prudent thing to do for our kids is to just do nothing.\u201d\nSo there is only one remedy: Get power. If you are as fed up as I am, then register someone to vote or run for office yourself or donate money to someone running to replace these cowardly legislators with a majority for common-sense gun laws. This is about raw power, not persuasion. And the first chance we have to change the balance of power is the 2018 midterm elections. Forget about trying to get anything done before then. Don\u2019t waste your breath.\nJust get power.

SPITZER Continue reading the main story Photo Crime scene tape surrounded the area of the mass shooting in Las Vegas. Credit Mark Ralston/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images IN the immediate aftermath of one of the worst mass shootings in American history, I sought information about what happened by googling \u201cfully automatic weapons\u201d and \u201cLas Vegas.\u201d Audio recordings from the scene had picked up the utterly distinctive sound of fully automatic gunfire. (It appears the gun was a modified semiautomatic weapon.) But instead of turning up details of the massacre, the top search results yielded multiple advertisements for sites like \u201c Battlefield Vegas \u201d (\u201cBook Now!\u201d) and M.G.V. (\u201cMachine Guns Vegas\u201d), where customers can purchase firing-range time with fully automatic \u201cexclusive Las Vegas gun range packages ,\u201d according to the second website. But what happens in Vegas doesn\u2019t always stay in Vegas, and sometimes the line between fantasy violence and the real thing disappears. The horror of the mass shooting in Las Vegas is demarcated by the sheer number of casualties inflicted by a single individual \u2014 more than 50 dead and more than 500 injured \u2014 made possible by the use of a modified semi- automatic weapon or weapons, meaning those that fire a continuous stream of bullets by depressing the trigger. Semiautomatic weapons fire one bullet with each pull of the trigger. The Vegas shooting stands out because, for all of the gun crimes committed annually in America, fully automatic or modified semiautomatic weapons virtually never play a role, thanks to America\u2019s first significant national gun law. America\u2019s close-up experience with automatic weapons nearly a century ago culminated in the adoption of the National Firearms Act of 1934. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Prohibition and later the Great Depression fueled the rise of gangsterism that spread unregulated but powerful weapons developed for warfare, including the Tommy gun (\u201cthe gun that made the twenties roar\u201d) and the Browning automatic rifle. By the start of the 1930s, more than half of the states had sharply regulated or barred such fully automatic weapons. In the summer of 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law a measure to bring these and other gangster weapons and equipment, like sawed-off shotguns and silencers, under federal control. The new law required an extensive and intensive background check, fingerprinting, registration with a national database and payment of a $200 fee. Continue reading the main story The effectiveness of this measure, amended slightly in 1968 and 1986 to ban possession of full automatic weapons, or machine guns, manufactured after that year, put a lid on the spread of these weapons. According to government records, today only about a half-million such guns are in civilian hands. (To comply with the 1986 law expanding the 1934 Firearms Act, citizens are barred from purchasing any fully automatic weapon made after 1986. That includes weapons manufactured to fire in full auto mode and those altered to fire in full auto.) Of guns used in crimes subject to law enforcement tracing, only three of every 1,000 were machine guns.

Opt out or contact us anytime This success story notwithstanding, mass shootings are on the rise, facilitated by weapons that can still deliver plenty of destructive power. In a study of mass shootings over a 30-year period, more than a third were committed with semiautomatic assault weapons (there are perhaps five million such weapons legally owned as of 2016). Yet even as mass shootings rise, most of the nation has gone in the opposite direction, following the contrary notion that somehow we would be better off with fewer gun laws and more guns. For example, at the start of the 1980s, 19 states banned concealed gun carrying by civilians entirely, and 29 states had great discretion over whether to grant carry permits. Only one state, Vermont, imposed no permitting restrictions. As of this year, only nine states retain discretion over whether to grant permits (New York is one). In 29 states, permits must be issued to applicants unless they are felons or mentally incompetent, and 12 states have abolished permitting entirely. In 24 states, no gun training is required to carry a gun. Congress is now considering a bill, called concealed carry reciprocity, to require that every state\u2019s concealed-carry standard be accepted by every other state. This would have the effect of undercutting states with stricter laws since it would impose a national lowest-common-denominator standard. A different effort to thwart a successful gun law is afoot in Congress: The House of Representatives was poised to pass a bill to remove the 1934 N.F.A. background check, registration and fee requirements one must satisfy to own a gun silencer (also called \u201csuppressors\u201d). Because of the Las Vegas shooting, that bill is now shelved , but when things die down, expect its progress to resume. The reason for the change? Advocates argue that silencers are almost never used in crimes, and that silencers help protect the gun users\u2019 hearing. Yet the very reason silencers were originally subject to registration regulations was because they were used in crimes, and because their chief utility was to conceal gun crimes and illegal hunting with guns. And while the modern idea of protecting the shooter\u2019s hearing is laudable, the more effective method for doing so would be to subsidize gun owners\u2019 ownership of proper hearing-protection devices, precisely so that innocent bystanders can tell where hostile fire is coming from \u2014 whether in the woods during hunting season or in the killing grounds of downtown Las Vegas. The gun issue is virtually the only one where the default response is increasingly to shrug and say that laws don\u2019t matter, since bad people do bad things, so why bother with new ones? That facile and false logic jumps over an obvious question: Shouldn\u2019t the government do more to keep highly destructive weapons from the wrong hands? Sure, it\u2019s a politically fraught question, but it\u2019s no less important. Admittedly, mass shooters tend to be individuals with little or no serious criminal past, making them hard to identify before they commit these acts. Recent research has suggested a high correlation with their abuse of intimate partners or family members, but a vast majority of abusers will never pick up a gun and shoot a bunch of people. Still, many mass shooters do give indications of impending violence to those around them, and only a few states have any measures in place to pick up on that. New York, as it happens, is one, with its extensive character background investigation for pistol permit applicants (a process I underwent). Other states would do well to follow its lead. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story If we can\u2019t settle on sensible gun regulations in the wake of Sandy Hook or San Bernardino or Orlando or now Las Vegas (or Aurora or Columbine or Virginia Tech before them), when will we?

Uber and Transport for London, which oversees much of the city\u2019s public transport system, issued separate brief statements after the meeting between Mr. Khosrowshahi and Mike Brown, London\u2019s transport commissioner. Both described the talks as \u201cconstructive\u201d and said they would have further discussions in \u201cthe coming weeks.\u201d\n  Advertisement\n  Mr. Khosrowshahi visited London as the company he was chosen to lead just weeks ago continued to grapple with a new set of issues. Uber\u2019s board is considering proposals to limit the power of its co-founder and former chief executive, Travis Kalanick, as it courts a major new investment.\nAdvertisement\n  The push to win back London is also part of a wider effort to move past Mr. Kalanick\u2019s often-combative style and change Uber\u2019s reputation from ruthless disrupter to responsible corporate citizen.\nNo one expects a quick resolution to the dispute between Uber and Transport for London.\nThe regulator revoked Uber\u2019s taxi license last month, citing an array of issues in deciding that the company was not \u201cfit and proper\u201d to operate in the city. Uber\u2019s appeal of the ban could take months to resolve, and even if the company lost a second appeal, it could take the case to the highest court in the country. It can continue to operate in London throughout that process.\nIn the meantime, the ruling has highlighted divisions within the city.\nCritics are led chiefly by London\u2019s black-cab drivers. They must earn their licenses by memorizing 100,000 landmarks across 25,000 streets in London, an extremely difficult test known as The Knowledge . They argue that Uber drivers are underregulated and that the service systematically underprices competitors to win customers.\nHow Uber\u2019s Brash Approach Backfired A series of scandals have toppled executives, including Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder. \n\u201cTheir entire business model is based on predatory pricing,\u201d said Steve McNamara of the powerful Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association, which represents the British capital\u2019s centuries-old black-cab sector. \u201cUber wants to undercut competitors, establish a monopoly and then raise prices when they have a monopoly.\u201d\nSupporters of Uber, however, are plentiful. The company has garnered nearly 850,000 signatures for a Change.org petition called \u201cSave Your Uber in London.\u201d Proponents argue that satellite navigation has rendered The Knowledge obsolete, that black cabs are too expensive and that Uber\u2019s detailed tracking of drivers enhances passenger safety.\nThat most black-cab drivers are white, native-born Britons and many Uber drivers are immigrants serves only to complicate matters.\nMeetings between Uber and Transport for London have long been controversial affairs. Under Mr. Kalanick, Uber responded to regulators\u2019 concerns by mobilizing consumers to drown them out and by lobbying politicians at the highest level.\nWhen the previous mayor of London, Boris Johnson, a Conservative, tried to clamp down on Uber two years ago, he was told to stand down by the prime minister at the time, David Cameron, and his chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, also Conservatives.\nAdvertisement\n  One of Mr. Cameron\u2019s senior advisers at the time, Steve Hilton, is married to Rachel Whetstone, who was the head of communications for Uber. The couple are godparents to one of Mr. Cameron\u2019s children. The meetings often took place at 10 Downing Street and were chaired by Daniel Korski, Mr. Cameron\u2019s technology adviser.\n  \n  If there have been changes at the highest level at Uber, the dynamics in London have changed, too. The new mayor, Sadiq Khan, is a member of the opposition Labour Party and not beholden to the Conservative government of Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr. Cameron\u2019s successor.\nFor Uber, the London ban is but one of several headaches around the world that the company\u2019s leadership must confront.\nWhile Mr. Khosrowshahi is on his diplomacy mission, Uber\u2019s board is scheduled to discuss proposals that would limit Mr. Kalanick\u2019s power. That meeting will include two new directors named by Mr. Kalanick late last week, a surprise move that escalated tensions with other board members.\nPhoto Mr. Khosrowshahi in July. Credit Rob Latour/REX, via Associated Press Images The proposals are tentatively linked to a pending $10 billion investment in the company from a group led by SoftBank of Japan, a potential deal that Uber\u2019s board has worked on for weeks.\nIt is a sign of the importance of the London ban that, even with Uber\u2019s board meeting set to take place, Mr. Khosrowshahi flew here to meet with the authorities. With 40,000 drivers and 3.5 million customers, the city is Uber\u2019s biggest market in Europe, and one of its largest in the world.\n\u201cLondon is the Champions League of transportation,\u201d Mr. Kalanick told the British newspaper City A.M. three years ago, referring to a top European soccer tournament. \u201cIt has got a more dynamic, more competitive transportation system than any other city in the world.\u201d\nThe effort on Tuesday is meant to show that Uber is adopting a more conciliatory approach to working with cities. Such a change in attitude is important as Uber continues to expand globally and justify its sky-high $68.5 billion valuation ahead of an initial public offering that Mr. Khosrowshahi has said could come in 2019.\nThere are plenty of challenges, though.\nThe company\u2019s most senior executive based here, Jo Bertram, recently resigned . And elsewhere, Uber continues to face pressure from both governments and competitors. It gave up its ambitions to expand in China last year when it sold its operations there to a venture run by Didi Chuxing, a homegrown rival. It also sold its Russian business this summer to a new joint venture run by its main competitor in that country, Yandex.\nAdvertisement\n  Uber has also faced criticism over the treatment of its drivers. Last month, the company appealed a British court decision in which judges ruled that Uber drivers should be classified and treated as employees. The company argues that its drivers are self-employed contractors.\nThat claim has come in for scrutiny from Europe\u2019s highest court as well.

But he submerged many of those aspirations in his later years as he worked to unify the factions that contested for power after the fall of Mr. Hussein in 2003. Photo Kurdish pesh merga soldiers with an image of Jalal Talibani in 2014. Credit Andrea Bruce for The New York Times Mr. Talabani was a member of the Iraqi Governing Council, which drafted the country\u2019s interim Constitution after the war. The National Assembly named him interim president in April 2005, to succeed Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer. A year later he became the first president to be elected under the new Constitution. As the war in Iraq wound down in 2010, Mr. Talabani figured in the Obama administration\u2019s plans for a postwar government there. In their 2012 book, \u201cThe Endgame: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Iraq, from George W. Bush to Barack Obama,\u201d Michael R. Gordon, a former correspondent for The New York Times, and retired Lt. Gen. Bernard E. Trainor wrote that Mr. Obama made a confidential call to Mr. Talabani asking him to give up the Iraqi presidency so that a more inclusive government might be formed under Ayad Allawi, a Shiite with broad Sunni support. The administration\u2019s aim, the authors wrote, was to counter what the White House saw as a drift toward authoritarianism under Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. Mr. Talabani refused. He was re-elected a week later. Mr. Talabani, widely known as Mam Jalal or Uncle Jalal, cut a Falstaffian figure, typically in bespoke suits. A rotund, gregarious gourmand, he enjoyed nothing so much as a bountiful table and Cuban cigars as he grew wealthy from duties on oil exported illegally through Turkey. His health was not as robust. He collapsed from exhaustion in February 2007, and an American military plane took him to a hospital in Amman, Jordan. He returned home after 17 days, but that May he went to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for rest and treatment for what he called \u201cmy obesity.\u2019\u2019 In the summer of 2008, he returned to the Mayo Clinic for an operation to repair a heart valve. Then came the stroke, at the end of 2012, when he was flown to Germany for treatment. Mr. Talabani was a consummate political survivor and an openhanded pragmatist, if not an ideological chameleon, adept at maintaining his equilibrium in the sectarian, often ruthless environment of postwar Iraq. He was quite capable of startling marriages of political convenience, some ending in equally expedient divorce. After the Islamic revolution brought Ayatollah Khomeini to power in Iran in 1979, for example, Mr. Talabani backed the Iranian Kurds against the regime in Tehran. Later, he allied himself with the Tehran government in its war with Baghdad. Photo Mr. Talabani during a visit to France in 2009. Credit Christophe Ena/Associated Press In a 2007 profile in The New Yorker by Jon Lee Anderson, Iraq\u2019s national security adviser, the Shiite politician Mowaffak al-Rubaie, was quoted as calling Mr. Talabani \u201cvery difficult to define.\u201d \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIf you are an Islamist, he brings you Koranic verses; if you\u2019re a Marxist, he\u2019ll talk to you about Marxist-Leninist theory, dialectics and Descartes,\u201d the article quoted Mr. al-Rubaie as saying. \u201cHe has a very interesting ability to speak several languages, sometimes with a very limited vocabulary. He has a lot of anecdotes and knows a lot of jokes. He is an extraordinarily generous person, and he spends like there\u2019s no tomorrow.\u201d Jalal Talabani was born on Nov. 12, 1933, in the northeastern Kurdish village of Kelkan, near Suleimaniya. The Talabani clan was a powerful one, and his father was one of its leaders. Jalal\u2019s political life started early. At 13 he joined a clandestine group of Kurdish students in what was then British-ruled Iraq. At 18 he was among the ranking members of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, led by Mustafa Barzani. Mr. Talabani attended law school at Baghdad University but withdrew to evade arrest for his role in founding the Kurdistan Student Union. He traveled to China in 1955, met Premier Zhou Enlai and translated writings of Mao Zedong \u2014 his political role model \u2014 into Kurdish. He returned to Iraq after the fall of the Hashemite monarchy in 1958 and graduated from law school the next year. In 1961, after his compulsory service in the Iraqi Army, he joined a Kurdish independence uprising led by Mr. Barzani. Mr. Talabani served Mr. Barzani as an overseas envoy, living first in Lebanon and later in Syria. He also traveled through Europe and the Mideast, establishing political friendships with Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, King Hussein of Jordan and Hafez al-Assad of Syria. Photo Mr. Talabani spoke at the opening of the United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York in 2010. Credit Jason Szenes/European Pressphoto Agency Mr. Talabani quit and rejoined the Kurdistan Democratic Party several times before splitting with Mr. Barzani and switching his allegiance to a splinter group led by the politician and novelist Ibrahim Ahmed. Mr. Talabani married Mr. Ahmed\u2019s daughter, Hero, in 1970. In 1975, he united several Kurdish groups into a new party, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. An avowed Marxist and Maoist, Mr. Talabani was angry that the United States had initially sided with Iraq, and Mr. Hussein, during the Iran-Iraq War, which lasted from 1980 to 1988. \nAdvertisement With the war winding down in the spring of 1988, Mr. Talabani slipped out of Iraq through Iran to make his first trip to the United States.

Photo by Doug Mills/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump ventured on Tuesday to a storm-ravaged American island territory where residents have felt neglected by their government, telling Puerto Rican officials that they should be proud that only 16 people were known to have died in Hurricane Maria.\n\u201cSixteen versus in the thousands,\u201d Mr. Trump said, comparing the storm\u2019s certified death toll to the 1,833 killed in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina, which he described as a \u201creal catastrophe.\u201d\n\u201cYou can be very proud of all of your people, all of our people working together,\u201d he said. \u201cSixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud.\u201d\nShortly after Mr. Trump departed the island, Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 told a news conference in San Juan that deaths related to Hurricane Maria had risen to 34.\nAdvertisement\n Except for that sad adjustment, the trip marked a well-worn routine for a president on his fourth visit to a disaster zone in two months: a pep rally-like briefing with officials in an aircraft hangar, a quick drive past twisted houses and uprooted trees and a brief, friendly encounter with victims of the destruction.\n Advertisement\n And like his earlier travels, it had its peculiar moments: He also gently tossed rolls of paper towels into a crowd that gathered to see him at Calvary Chapel, outside the island\u2019s capital, San Juan.\nPhoto Mr. Trump shook hands with Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, right, the mayor of San Juan, but did not ask her to speak on Tuesday during a briefing held at an air base.

Over the weekend, the president lashed out at the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, after she complained that the federal response in Puerto Rico had fallen short of the responses in Texas and Florida . She was not mollified after meeting him.\n\u201cThe first part of the meeting was a public-relations situation,\u201d Ms. Cruz said in an interview with CNN about the briefing she attended with the president. While she said the White House staff was helpful and receptive, Mr. Trump\u2019s communications style sometimes \u201cgets in the way.\u201d\n\u201cI would hope that the president of the United States stops spouting out comments that really hurt the people of Puerto Rico,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause, rather than commander in chief, he sort of becomes miscommunicator in chief.\u201d\nMr. Trump greeted the mayor but did not invite her to speak, recognizing instead Mr. Rossell\u00f3, who the president said \u201cdid not play politics,\u201d and Puerto Rico\u2019s congressional representative, who lavishly applauded the administration\u2019s performance.\n\u201cThank you, Mr. President, for all you have been doing for the island,\u201d said Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, the territory\u2019s nonvoting representative, who declared that Washington had sent everything Puerto Rico needed.\n\u201cYou were really generous,\u201d Mr. Trump replied. \u201cIt\u2019s so important when you have men and women that have worked so hard and so long, and many of them came from two other catastrophic hurricanes.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n The president then went around the briefing table, praising the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, military commanders and a half-dozen members of his cabinet who accompanied him to Puerto Rico \u2014 which was already facing about $74 billion in debt even before the hurricane hit.\nNewsletter Sign Up Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Kelly, who was standing in the back, Mr. Trump said, \u201cBoy, is he watching.\u201d\nBefore leaving the White House on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters he believed Ms. Cruz was now mostly satisfied.\n\u201cI think she\u2019s come back a long way,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s now acknowledged what a great job we\u2019ve done.\u201d He asserted that the relief effort was as effective as those in Texas and Florida, and he added, \u201cIt\u2019s actually a much tougher situation.\u201d\nMr. Trump, however, repeated his earlier criticism that some Puerto Ricans were not doing enough to help themselves. Despite the roads being cleared and communications being re-established, he said, truck drivers were not transporting enough supplies. \u201cWe need their truck drivers to start driving trucks,\u201d he said. \u201cOn a local level, they have to give us more help.\u201d\nOn Saturday, after Ms. Cruz angrily disputed the administration\u2019s assertion that the relief effort was going well, the president fired back in a Twitter post that she had been instructed by Democrats to be \u201cnasty to Trump,\u201d and added that Puerto Ricans \u201cwant everything to be done for them.\u201d\nWhite House officials were nervous that Mr. Trump would be set off again if he were greeted by protesters in Puerto Rico. As late as Monday afternoon, some aides were urging the president to delay the visit, which came a day before he was scheduled to fly to Las Vegas to meet with law enforcement officials and victims of Sunday\u2019s mass shooting there.\nThere were a few other signs of discontent on Tuesday. As Mr. Trump\u2019s motorcade drove from an air base to a church \u2014 passing hundreds of downed trees \u2014 it also passed a woman clutching a placard that said, \u201cYou are a bad hombre ,\u201d according to a pool report.\nVideo Amid Promises of Aid, a Puerto Rico Still in Ruins President Trump said Puerto Ricans should be \u201cproud\u201d of the low death toll after Hurricane Maria. But a tour of the island by New York Times reporters showed that vast humanitarian and logistical challenges remain.\nBy DEBORAH ACOSTA and NATALIE RENEAU on Publish Date October 3, 2017. Photo by Deborah Acosta/The New York Times. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed Sitting in a traffic jam near the San Juan airport before the arrival of Air Force One, a resident, Jaime Vega, disputed Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that Puerto Ricans should be doing more to help their own recovery. \u201cWe are doing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only now that they are doing something.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n \u201cLet him come so he can see what there really is, and so nobody can tell him made-up stories,\u201d said Mr. Vega, an accountant.\nOutside a bar in the Santurce neighborhood of San Juan, an hour after Air Force One departed Tuesday afternoon, people debated what Mr. Trump\u2019s visit might have accomplished.\n\u201cHe was just measuring Puerto Rico by the amount of dead compared to Katrina,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Tormos, 62, an employee of the local government in Guaynabo. \u201cFEMA\u2019s response has been too slow.\u201d\nEven before the death toll was increased on Tuesday evening, others noted that the actual number of people killed by Hurricane Maria may rise significantly, given that the earlier, certified tally was outdated and that the island government\u2019s record-keeping ability has been damaged by the storm. Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said 19 of the total 34 deaths so far were directly related to the storm, like drownings. The others included electrical failures of oxygen tanks, suicides and natural causes like heart attacks, he said.\nMarlene Martinez, 51, an accountant, said, \u201cIt\u2019s just an example of how we\u2019re treated like second-class citizens.\u201d\nOthers were more concerned about the reconstruction of the island and their own precarious situations than Mr. Trump\u2019s comments.\nPhoto Mr. Trump tossed rolls of paper towels to storm victims on Tuesday at a church outside San Juan. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times \u201cThe people of Puerto Rico don\u2019t care whether Trump is the god or the devil,\u201d said Edgardo Tormos, 58. \u201cThis is about the recovery of Puerto Rico.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n Still, others seemed happy just to have the president in their midst. In a 20-minute visit to Calvary Chapel, an English-speaking evangelical church that has become a collection center for supplies, Mr. Trump shook hands, took selfies and offered encouragement in the chapel\u2019s sanctuary.\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s really nothing political,\u201d said Naitsa Marrero, an administrative assistant who helped organize the stop. \u201cPuerto Rico needs help, and often this type of thing sheds light on what\u2019s happening here \u2014 a crisis.\u201d\nJason Dennett, the church\u2019s pastor, said he welcomed the idea of a visit when the Secret Service contacted him five days ago. \u201cHe offered his help to the people of Puerto Rico,\u201d Mr. Dennett said. \u201cHe said he was here to help and that the support would continue.\u201d\nMr. Trump boarded a Navy amphibious assault ship for meetings with the governors of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. The White House asked the Virgin Islands\u2019s governor, Kenneth E. Mapp, to fly to Puerto Rico because of the logistical complications of flying the president to those islands, parts of which have been severely damaged.\nStill, Mr. Mapp told him, \u201cbecause of your commitment, Mr. President, we\u2019re talking about opening schools and welcoming cruise ships back.\u201d\nMr. Trump has gotten used to being a kind of second responder, having traveled to Texas and Florida after two other hurricanes over the past two months. Since the weekend, Mr. Trump has sharply scaled back his Twitter posts about the hurricanes or other potentially charged issues.\nBut speaking to reporters on Tuesday, he continued to emphasize the government\u2019s performance rather than the plight of the victims.\n\u201cIn Texas and in Florida, we get an A-plus,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you what, I think we\u2019ve done just as good in Puerto Rico.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cruz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenneth e. mapp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melania trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump lands", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states virgin islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the virgin islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luis muniz air national guard base", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:54:36.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "17ee2b72d729a1e6f4c394e92f43d745126533ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjx94kgkhx2boya8K.ovRfemgl_qBQPbC1NaFKRU0EKUSYofRy7asaXrrG8U3lrFE5Fzym5E2hp6Vsww1z8fL5E4g--", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Britain Is Ready to Walk Away With No Deal on Brexit, Davis Says - The New York Times", "title_full": "Britain Is Ready to Walk Away With No Deal on Brexit, Davis Says - The New York Times", "published": "2017-10-03T17:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.177, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "17ee2b72d729a1e6f4c394e92f43d745126533ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjx94kgkhx2boya8K.ovRfemgl_qBQPbC1NaFKRU0EKUSYofRy7asaXrrG8U3lrFE5Fzym5E2hp6Vsww1z8fL5E4g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T17:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Britain Is Ready to Walk Away With No Deal on Brexit, Davis Says - The New York Times", "text": "Britain Is Ready to Walk Away With No Deal on Brexit, Davis Says By REUTERS Continue reading the main story MANCHESTER, England \u2014 Britain wants to negotiate a Brexit agreement with the European Union, but is ready to walk away with no deal, Brexit minister David Davis said on Tuesday, warning that any error in the talks could cost them billions of pounds. At the annual conference of the Conservative Party, Davis told members the government did not want to fail in the talks to unravel more than 40 years of union, but officials were \"contingency planning\" to make sure all scenarios were covered. British Prime Minister Theresa May has tried to unblock the talks with EU leaders, after they stalled over disagreements on the final divorce bill, by making concessions on the role of the European court and the financial settlement. But earlier on Tuesday, the European Parliament passed a non-binding motion calling on EU leaders to conclude at a summit on Oct. 19-20 that Brexit talks had not made sufficient progress to justify opening trade negotiations with Britain. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story \"On the negotiating front, we are aiming for a good deal. And that is what we expect to achieve. However, if the outcome of the negotiation falls short of the deal that Britain needs we will be ready for the alternative,\" Davis said.

Credit Juliana Sohn for The New York Times Two new Manhattan hotels feature one of the hottest and most highly coveted amenities in the hospitality industry: rooftop venues that offer food, drink, entertainment and spectacular views.\nThe 189-room Mondrian Park Avenue, at 30th Street and Park Avenue South, occupies what was once a 15-story office building, to which five stories have been added. The hotel\u2019s former rooftop is now a lounge called Fifteen Stories, with a 3,000-square-foot space enclosed by a glass structure and a 2,000-square-foot wraparound terrace overlooking both Park Avenue South and 30th Street. Stephen Brandman, co-owner and chief executive of Journal Hotels, which operates the Mondrian Park Avenue, has teamed up with Richie Akiva of the night life company Butter Group to operate Fifteen Stories.\nEven more elaborate is the Magic Hour Rooftop Bar and Lounge, a 10,000-square-foot \u201curban amusement park\u201d atop Marriott International\u2019s Moxy Times Square, which occupies a 1906 building at Seventh Avenue and 36th Street. Originally a hotel for immigrant construction workers, the building was converted to commercial office space. Its owner, the Lightstone Group, worked with the Rockwell Group to develop the rooftop\u2019s amenities, including views of the Empire State Building, an all-season bar, topiaries of bears in naughty poses, a carousel for up to 16 guests and a miniature golf course. The TAO Group, the operator of several popular restaurants and nightclubs in New York and Las Vegas, is Lightstone\u2019s partner on food, beverage and entertainment.\n Hotel rooftop development is not a new phenomenon. Earlier examples in New York include the Salon de Ning rooftop bar and terrace at the Peninsula on Fifth Avenue and the Plunge Rooftop Bar and Lounge at the Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC hotel. And in San Francisco, there is the Top of the Mark at the Intercontinental Mark Hopkins.\n What is spurring the latest incarnations, said Henry Harteveldt, travel analyst for Atmosphere Research, is the marketing potential of the picture-taking opportunities that rooftops afford guests, who post their photos on social media, particularly Instagram.\nPhoto The alleyway entrance to Moxy Times Square\u2019s rooftop. Credit Juliana Sohn for The New York Times Developers are taking those social media moments into consideration when building a rooftop experience, said Jonah Chusid, vice president of hotel operations for Espresso Hospitality.\n\u201cPeople will pay a premium to be able to take a photo from a rooftop restaurant with a phenomenal view,\u201d Mr. Chusid said.\nHis company manages the William Vale, a 183-room hotel that opened last fall in Brooklyn\u2019s popular Williamsburg neighborhood. Its Westlight rooftop bar offers 360-degree views of the city and is operated by the NoHo Hospitality Group with food by Andrew Carmellini.\nIndeed, food and beverage revenue generated on rooftops can be significant, said Bjorn Hanson, clinical professor at the Jonathan M. Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism at New York University. Beverage sales are the second-most profitable part of hotel operations in the United States, after room revenue, he said, adding that hotels can charge a premium for rooftop drinks, making them even more profitable.\nRooftop amenities have become so popular that many hotels use dedicated elevators for them and often give hotel guests priority access. Moxy\u2019s rooftop, for example, is accessible through a separate alleyway on Seventh Avenue with a \u201cspeakeasy feeling,\u201d said Mitchell C. Hochberg, president of Lightstone.\nPhoto The Westlight rooftop at the William Vale, a 183-room hotel that opened last fall in Brooklyn.

Shah, president of Hersha Hospitality Trust, the Envoy\u2019s owner. On weekends, he said, many of the hotel\u2019s guests \u201cstay only to get to the rooftop.\u201d\n Mr. Brandman of Journal Hotels said hotel rooftop amenities \u201ctruly create a connection.\u201d\n\u201cThe rooftop is really about an extension of the community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can create experiences that didn\u2019t exist before.\u201d\nNewsletter Sign Up\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy Opt out or contact us anytime Hotels cater to locals with a variety of entertainment and classes, some free, on their rooftops. This month, for example, the William Vale is offering a \u201csunrise silent disco,\u201d where music is broadcast to guests wearing wireless headphones, and the Moxy has Friday morning exercise classes taught by modelFIT, a Manhattan gym. The Ace Hotel Downtown Los Angeles, which opened in 2014, offers a wide range of activities, including stand-up comedy sessions, D.J. residencies and a flower dyeing workshop.\nFred Dixon, president and chief executive of NYC & Company, the marketing organization of the city\u2019s tourism industry, suggested that rooftops had begun to replace nightclubs in New York.\n\u201cThey are multigenerational, not intimidating like a nightclub, and are much more casual than a nightclub,\u201d he said.\nPhoto A walkway into the bar area at the Moxy Times Square\u2019s rooftop. Credit Juliana Sohn for The New York Times Of the almost 650 hotels that the industry tracker STR estimates occupy the city\u2019s five boroughs, some 70 offer a rooftop experience, Mr. Dixon said.\nCertain hotel rooftops have been developed for specific purposes. The $370 million Marriott Marquis Houston, which opened in December, is made up of a tower with 1,000 guest rooms and a podium that contains the hotel\u2019s ballroom, among other facilities. A $10 million amenity deck, including a \u201clazy river\u201d water feature in the shape of Texas, was built on the podium\u2019s rooftop specifically to attract local residents.\nIn fact, the lazy river has attracted both families and meeting and convention groups to the hotel, which is connected to the city\u2019s convention center, said Luke Charlton, chief operating officer of the hotel\u2019s co-owner, the RIDA Development Corporation. He predicted that food and beverage revenue this year from the podium\u2019s rooftop \u2014 which also features a 75-foot lap pool and a bar and grill and is open only to hotel guests \u2014 would exceed projections.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing double what we and Marriott thought we would do,\u201d he said. He added that the effect of Hurricane Harvey on the hotel had been \u201crelatively minor.\u201d\nCold or inclement weather can, of course, pose a challenge to hotel rooftop operators. The Envoy, for one, has come up with a novel way to handle this: In February, it installed on its rooftop six heavy plastic igloos, each seating up to 10 people and containing carpeting, chairs, blankets, and electrical outlets for lighting and heaters.\nNoisy rooftop patrons can also be problematic, potentially alienating both hotel guests and neighbors. Mr. Brandman said Journal Hotels would strive to \u201cmaintain a certain type of environment reflective of the hotel, not looking to be overcrowded or noisy,\u201d on the rooftop of the Mondrian Park Avenue. Similarly, the Envoy\u2019s Lookout closes one hour earlier than most Boston bars, in deference to its guests and neighbors, Mr. Shah said.\n And he, like no doubt many other hotel owners, will continue to forge ahead with more rooftop development.

Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times Nine weeks ago, Anthony Scaramucci was still the communications director to the president, flying on Air Force One and steering the public relations strategy of the White House.\nOn Monday evening, he was a man with his arm in a sling, explaining how the moon landing led to the invention of Tang and Velcro ( it didn\u2019t ) to reporters in the mirrored basement of a Midtown Manhattan steakhouse that he partially owns.\nThe arc of Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s career is long and strange, and lately it has bent toward ignominy. After being fired by President Trump , sued for divorce and turned into a late-night pi\u00f1ata for his foul-mouthed speaking habits, Mr. Scaramucci is trying to mount a comeback with a media venture he is calling The Scaramucci Post.\nSo far, the project\u2019s contours are vague. \u201cIt\u2019s going to start out experiential on the net,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci, an American flag pinned to his lapel, said during a launch party at the Hunt & Fish Club on West 44th Street.\n He was invited to elaborate.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to create traffic and content and an experience using Facebook, Instagram and Twitter,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said. (The @ScaramucciPost Twitter account, with its caveat that \u201cFollows \u2260 Job Offers,\u201d has been something of a mystery in political circles.)\n The publication is so devoted to its social media strategy that it has no journalists, no articles and no website \u2014 apparently by design. \u201cYou\u2019ll find that if you don\u2019t have a website, guess what? You don\u2019t have any server charges,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said.\nPhoto Members of the press and guests at a launch party for The Scaramucci Post. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times Later, he conceded that he had \u201cno idea what the Scaramucci Post is.\u201d\nHis partner in the venture, a former hedge fund manager turned social media consultant named Lance Laifer , stood nearby, urging Mr. Scaramucci to speak into an iPhone that was transmitting the proceedings via streaming video.\nMr. Laifer, a friend of Mr. Scaramucci for years, founded Old Forge Media Management and is probably best known as the man who persuaded the actor Taye Diggs to follow tens of thousands of people on Twitter. He said the idea for the Scaramucci Post was hatched during a 1 a.m. phone call while he was visiting Disney World with his family. \u201cWhat I think we can do here is take people and get them to work together to make the world a better place,\u201d Mr. Laifer said.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a wide open space in the middle that\u2019s not being served the way it was served when I was a kid,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci added. \u201cIt\u2019s the Walter Cronkite space, the space in the middle where there\u2019s a level of objectivity.\u201d\nGuests at the party, held beneath a mirrored ceiling dotted with festive red lights, included a number of Scaramucci supporters, among them employees of his hedge fund, SkyBridge Capital. A buffet featured giant popovers and penne mushroom ragu. Mr. Scaramucci wore a sling, the result of a recent shoulder injury, which he attributed to horseplay with one of his children on the basketball court.\nLong a minor celebrity on Wall Street, Mr. Scaramucci came to prominence as the silver-tongued Trump confrere whose brief run at the White House culminated in an expletive-laced tirade to a New Yorker correspondent. Recently, he hired a Hollywood publicist and has appeared on TMZ, \u201cThe View,\u201d and \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\u201d\nOn Monday, he announced that the Scaramucci Post has signed its first advertiser: the Knockout Times , a website about female athletes started by a woman named Jamie Lewis who said she knew Mr. Scaramucci from her time working on Wall Street. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to bring a voice to strong female women, specifically related to athletics,\u201d Ms. Lewis said.\nOne reporter began a question by noting that Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s White House tenure had lasted only 10 days. The host interrupted.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said, a glint in his eye. \u201cEleven days.\u201d\nCorrection: October 3, 2017\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of the creator of the web site Knockout Times.

Credit Michael Reynolds/European Pressphoto Agency Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive, Timothy J. Sloan, on Tuesday faced blistering attacks from Republican and Democratic senators, who voiced frustration with his response to a series of scandals that have rocked the bank.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, accused Mr. Sloan of promoting an aggressive sales culture that led bankers to create millions of fake accounts. She called for his ouster.\n\u201cAt best you are incompetent, at worst you were complicit,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cEither way you should be fired.\u201d\nShe added that all Wells Fargo directors who served on the board during the years of the fake account scandal should be removed.\n Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, also questioned whether Mr. Sloan had done enough to change the culture of Wells Fargo. Since the existence of fake accounts was revealed just over a year ago , other scandals have been uncovered, including instances in which auto insurance customers were charged excess fees and active duty service members had their cars seized.\n \u201cThe changes Mr. Sloan and his team have made are not sufficient to reform a corporate culture that is willing to abuse its customers and employees in an effort to pad its numbers and increase executive compensation,\u201d Mr. Brown said.\n Mr. Sloan defended his actions, both during his decades at the bank before he was named chief executive last year , and during his year as chief executive.\n\u201cI am deeply sorry for letting down our customers and team members,\u201d he said. \u201cI apologize for the damage done to all the people who work and bank at this important American institution. When the challenges at Wells Fargo demanded decisive action, the bank\u2019s leaders acted too slowly and too incrementally. That was unacceptable.\u201d\nMr. Sloan said he was still working to fix the bank\u2019s aggressive sales culture.\n\u201cI also want to be clear about another thing: Wells Fargo is a better bank today than it was a year ago,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd next year, Wells Fargo will be a better bank than it is today. That is because we have spent the past year determined to earn back the public\u2019s trust.\u201d\nThe remarks did not satisfy the senators.\nSenator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, asked Mr. Sloan: \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name were you thinking?\u201d\nContinue reading the main story We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page.

Major automakers posted higher U.S. new vehicle sales in September as consumers in hurricane-hit parts of the country rushed to replace flood-damaged cars. General Motors' shares rose 3.1 percent and hit a record intraday high, while Ford's stock was up 2.1 percent. Airline shares were among the biggest positives in the S&P 500. Delta Air Lines, also the S&P 500's top percentage gainer, jumped 6.6 percent after it reported that its \"cargo ton miles\" metric rose 9.4 percent in September from a year earlier. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Shares of United Continental gained 6.1 percent while the S&P 1500 airlines index was up 5.5 percent The news was the latest evidence of economic growth. The signs, including factory data on Monday, have helped lead the market to recent record highs and boosted shares of economically sensitive companies including in materials and industrials. Continue reading the main story \"We're seeing moves into economically sensitive stocks, which is an indication that investors believe some of the favorable economic data that's coming out,\" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. At the same time, investors have put aside some of their recent concerns, such as tensions between the United States and North Korea, he said. The S&P industrials index was up 0.5 percent and among sectors with the biggest gains on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 84.07 points, or 0.37 percent, to close at 22,641.67, the S&P 500 gained 5.46 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,534.58 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.00 points, or 0.23 percent, to 6,531.71. All three hit record closing highs, along with the Russell 2000 small-cap index, which has been lifted recently by optimism about tax law overhaul prospects.

Credit Louisa Marie Summer for The New York Times Renate Langer, a 61-year-old former German actress, has reported to the Swiss police that the film director Roman Polanski raped her at a house in Gstaad in February 1972, when she was 15.\nMs. Langer is the fourth woman to publicly accuse Mr. Polanski of sexual assaulting her when she was a teenager.\nThe police in St. Gallen, Switzerland, confirmed that they met with Ms. Langer on Sept. 26. Ms. Langer provided The New York Times with a copy of an email \u2014 sent by a Swiss police officer \u2014 saying that another office would make the determination as to whether she could pursue a criminal complaint.\nSwitzerland has eliminated its statute of limitations on child sex abuse cases, but the law limits prosecution in cases that happened many years ago. Ms. Langer said in an interview that she had approached the Swiss police because she believed the statute of limitations would allow her complaint to be investigated.\nAdvertisement\n In an email sent to her lawyer and to a friend of Ms. Langer, the officer who spoke to her in St. Gallen said an interpretation of the law in this instance would be made by the public prosecutor\u2019s office in Bern.\n Advertisement\n Ms. Langer said in the interview that she had not previously reported anything to the police \u2014 and did not confide in friends and family at the time \u2014 largely out of concern for her parents. She said she told a boyfriend years later.\nPhoto Roman Polanski at the Cannes Film Festival in May.

Mr. Polanski pleaded guilty in 1977 to unlawful sex with Samantha Geimer when she was 13, but his lawyer has disputed other similar accusations in the past.\nIn August, a woman in Los Angeles, identified only as Robin M., came forward at a news conference to report that Mr. Polanski had sexually assaulted her in 1973 when she was 16.\nAt the time, Mr. Braun said in a statement that Mr. Polanski\u2019s reaction had been \u201cI don\u2019t know what this is about.\u201d\nIn 2010, the British actress Charlotte Lewis also accused Mr. Polanski of abusing her sexually when she was 16.\nMr. Polanski has been living in exile from the United States since fleeing the country in 1978 on the eve of his sentencing in the Geimer case.\nAdvertisement\n He has since resided in France but has spent time in Poland and Switzerland. France does not extradite its citizens, and judges in Poland and Switzerland have declined to extradite Mr. Polanski to stand trial in the United States. His lawyers have been fighting for his international arrest warrant to be lifted.\nPhoto Renate Langer in the mid-1980s. In August, a Los Angeles judge declined to drop the case against Mr. Polanski in the United States for the second time.\nOn Monday, The Hollywood Reporter published an interview with Mr. Polanski in which he said he considered the Geimer case to be closed.\n\u201cAs far as what I did: It\u2019s over. I pleaded guilty,\u201d he said.\nMs. Langer said she is speaking out now because she had read the account of the woman who came forward in August and because her parents are no longer alive.\nNewsletter Sign Up\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

She left the next day, full of shame and confusion, and said she chose not to tell her parents because it would devastate them.\nAbout a month later, she said, Mr. Polanski called her to apologize for what had happened and offered her a role in his movie \u201cChe?\u201d She said that she accepted after he indicated he would treat her professionally.\nShe flew to Rome alone and was given a small part in the movie.

Credit Michael Stravato for The New York Times Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, has a feel for evaluating prospects and identifying talent.\nBut this was different.\nLast year, during a brief hiatus from his day job scrutinizing jab steps and jump shots, Morey was able to partake in another interest \u2014 by sizing up love ballads submitted by composers who were vying to work on a musical comedy that he is producing. He later huddled with the show\u2019s writer and director.\n\u201cI made them follow our pre-draft process,\u201d Morey said. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018We all have to rank the players. And we can\u2019t talk before we rank them because you have to eliminate group think.\u2019 And then after we did all the rankings, we talked about it.\u201d\nThe musical, called \u201cSmall Ball,\u201d which is now bound for rehearsals and a six-week run in Houston, bridges two of Morey\u2019s great loves: basketball and Broadway. Known for his savvy, analytics-laced way of leading the Rockets , Morey \u2014 former high school trombonist, current theater obsessive \u2014 has relished the chance to sneak behind the curtain.\n \u201cSomeday,\u201d Morey said, \u201cI want to live in New York and just go to shows.\u201d\nFor now, he will settle for moonlighting as a producer.\n\u201cDaryl has as much of a passion for musicals as anybody I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d said Mickle Maher , a Chicago-based playwright who wrote the book and lyrics for \u201cSmall Ball,\u201d which is set to start in April at the Catastrophic Theater.\nMorey, who teamed with Maher and Jason Nodler , the artistic director at Catastrophic, to select Merel van Dijk and Anthony Barilla as the composers for \u201cSmall Ball,\u201d has had a hand in the project throughout \u2014 offering feedback as Maher developed the story, making appearances at a recent workshop \u2014 even as he plays down his direct involvement. He does have a basketball team to run.\n\u201cNew World\u201d Audio \u201cWe\u2019re just a bunch of friends doing this at this point,\u201d Morey said in a recent telephone interview. \u201cI guess we do have official titles: book writer, composer, director. So I\u2019m a producer of some ilk, whether that\u2019s executive producer or just producer.\u201d\nHe paused to consider his role.\n\u201cI provide the money,\u201d he said.\nThe story that Maher wrote tells of a newly discovered island nation that decides to join the modern world by fielding a team for an international basketball league. The country \u2014 Lilliput, from \u201cGulliver\u2019s Travels,\u201d which, lo and behold, exists in Maher\u2019s fantasyland \u2014 proceeds to sink its entire treasury into building a court and signing Michael Jordan, a journeyman point guard who just happens to have the same name as the iconic star. But that is all they share.\n \u201cHe\u2019s not a very good basketball player,\u201d Maher said.\nThere are other problems: Lilliput is a land of small people, so all of Jordan\u2019s teammates are 6 inches tall. Also, the country has no concept of the number five, so the coach is limited to sending just four players onto the court at a time. When Morey learned that Maher had included this plot twist, it bugged him.\n\u201cI\u2019m very logical,\u201d Morey said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t get it: How would these people not know that you need five players? And Mickle is like, \u2018Look, I\u2019ve done 40 plays. This is going to work.\u2019 And he was 100 percent right.\u201d\nBut the driving force behind the musical is none other than Jordan \u2014 the other Jordan, a basketball vagabond who bounces around at the margins before landing in Lilliput. The story addresses big themes: how a man without a true home finally finds one, how a small community tries to marry itself to the larger world.\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s a love story,\u201d Maher said.\nLong before he became one of the most respected executives in the N.B.A. , Morey was a band geek at Highland High School in Medina, Ohio. After performing excerpts from \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d he was hooked. He recalled coming across a rare cassette recording of \u201cJoseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,\u201d a thrill for a young fan of the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.\nPhoto Playwright Mickle Maher is collaborating with Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, on a musical about basketball. Credit Joshua Lott for The New York Times Today, Morey\u2019s appreciation for Stephen Sondheim runs so deep that he recently paid an artist to re-create \u201cA Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,\u201d the seminal work by the painter Georges Seurat that became the same work upon which Sondheim based his musical, \u201cSunday in the Park with George.\u201d\nWhenever Morey visits New York for work, he tries to find time for a show.\n\u201cYou can walk up 15 minutes beforehand and ask for a deal on a single,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one else is lame enough to do this, but I\u2019m lame enough to do it.\u201d\nNewsletter Sign Up\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy Opt out or contact us anytime The genesis of \u201cSmall Ball\u201d dates to a scouting trip that Morey took to France a few years ago. To pass the time while traveling from Paris to Marseilles, Morey answered questions from fans on social media . Someone asked Morey what he would be doing if he were not involved with basketball. Morey wrote that he would probably be working in theater.\nNodler, the artistic director at Catastrophic, learned of Morey\u2019s response from a fellow denizen of ClutchFans.net , a popular online forum for fans of the Rockets. (Nodler is so devoted to the team that he records games that overlap with evening rehearsals.) Nodler reached out to Morey by sending him a message on Facebook. He did not necessarily expect to hear back from him. Morey responded within a half hour.\n\u201cAnd it was just this wall of text,\u201d Nodler said. \u201cHere I was, thinking that I was contacting this great hero of mine. It turns out he was so excited to hear from somebody in the theater.\u201d\n Nodler invited Morey to see one of his plays at Catastrophic, and a friendship developed. Morey soon joined the theater\u2019s board of directors.\n\u201cDon\u2019t Drown\u201d Audio \u201cI didn\u2019t think the worlds of theater and basketball intersected,\u201d Morey said. \u201cI thought the Venn diagram would be one person: me. As it turns out, there are a few of us.\u201d\nEventually, Nodler pitched the idea of collaborating on a basketball musical. Morey sketched out a few ideas. Knowing they would need a writer, Nodler gauged Maher\u2019s interest; Catastrophic had staged several of his plays. Plus, Nodler knew that Maher was a fellow basketball fan.\n\u201cI think I said, \u2018That\u2019s the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard,\u2019 \u201d Maher said.\nMaher had his reasons for being apprehensive. A lot of sports-themed musicals have tanked. But the more that Maher considered the project, the more he wanted to take on the challenge.\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d Maher said.\nThis July, at a weeklong workshop at Catastrophic, the \u201cSmall Ball\u201d team \u2014 Nodler, Maher and Morey, along with the songwriters van Dijk and Barilla \u2014 developed the material with the help of a group of actors.\n\u201cDaryl\u2019s the person who could come into the room and suck up all the oxygen and boss everyone around,\u201d Maher said. \u201cBut he\u2019s just not that way at all. He has a great deal of respect for everyone who\u2019s involved in the process and gives notes and ideas in the most welcome way.\u201d\nMorey said his role at the workshop was minor.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything but sit and clap,\u201d he said.\nStill, Morey said he came away feeling energized. He also gained an appreciation for the talent of the actors and for his theater colleagues\u2019 managerial skills.\n\u201cLet\u2019s keep it vague,\u201d Morey said, \u201cbut I\u2019m like, \u2018Geez, they deal with more stuff than I do.\u2019\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daryl morey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "scott cacciola", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "jason nodler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daryl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merel van dijk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mickle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen sondheim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mickle maher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joshua lott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sondheim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew lloyd webber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael stravato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony barilla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georges seurat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael jordan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "elite n.b.a. team", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rockets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catastrophic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "highland high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston rockets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.b.a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times today", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lilliput", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broadway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catastrophic theater", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:32:24.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db1366de69ccb852e34299314cf0edfe0cb510a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxxQbOF6qH5Z0k4iUky4Tmh_ShnZPgWhYc18vKlmJiUBXUTW5IC1a79k4kJlnm1OGk.QXB9ZAHLAcIkSRA3CUDC06RAJttkY49aai3Sp1k7cdMPztvj3mPTg--", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://nytimes.com/timeswire/feeds/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NYT > Most Recent Headlines", "title": "Democrats Lament Inability to Pass Gun Restrictions: \u2018We are Stuck\u2019", "title_full": "Democrats Lament Inability to Pass Gun Restrictions: \u2018We are Stuck\u2019", "published": "2017-10-03T23:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5982, "comments": 0, "shares": 5982}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 58}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "db1366de69ccb852e34299314cf0edfe0cb510a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxxQbOF6qH5Z0k4iUky4Tmh_ShnZPgWhYc18vKlmJiUBXUTW5IC1a79k4kJlnm1OGk.QXB9ZAHLAcIkSRA3CUDC06RAJttkY49aai3Sp1k7cdMPztvj3mPTg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "SHERYL GAY STOLBERG", "published": "2017-10-03T23:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Democrats Lament Inability to Pass Gun Restrictions: \u2018We are Stuck\u2019", "text": " Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, called on the president to bring the leaders of Congress together on gun safety. Credit Pete Marovich for The New York Times WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, was at a loss on Tuesday.

The Las Vegas gunman apparently used so-called bump stocks \u2014 legal modifications to semiautomatic rifles \u2014 to help them fire more like automatic weapons.\n \u201cThis is the least we should do in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said. \u201cIt should be our highest priority.\u201d\nThat tactic mirrored the Democrats\u2019 tailored approaches of the past: After the Newtown shooting, they called for background checks for all gun purchases, including those at gun shows and from online sellers. After the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., last year, they tried to ban gun sales to people on federal no-fly or terrorism watch lists. After the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech, it was improving background checks to catch mental illness.\nAnd as they have done in the past, Republicans tried to steered the conversation in another direction, this time spotlighting the work of emergency medical workers. President Trump praised the swiftness of the Las Vegas law enforcement response, calling it \u201cin many ways, a miracle.\u201d\nIn the Capitol, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, rebuffed questions about potential legislative action during his regular news conference Tuesday afternoon, saying that he thought it \u201cparticularly inappropriate\u201d to politicize the massacre so soon. Republicans, he said, would instead remain focused on advancing a tax overhaul.\n\u201cLook, the investigation\u2019s not even been completed,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cAnd I think\u2019s it\u2019s premature to be discussing legislative solutions, if there are any.\u201d\nIndeed, the only gun legislation on the Republicans\u2019 agenda appears to be the so-called Hearing Protection Act \u2014 a gun rights measure that would eliminate a $200 tax on firearm silencers, refund silencer-tax payments back to October of 2015, and ease registration requirements.\nThat measure has been working its way through the House, though Speaker Paul D. Ryan said on Tuesday that he has no plans at the moment to bring it up for a vote. House Democratic leaders have called for Mr. Ryan to withdraw the gun silencers bill, and to create a special committee to investigate gun violence in America, which would report back with legislative solutions.\nPhoto Gabrielle Giffords, the former Democratic congresswoman from Arizona who was left brain damaged after a 2011 mass shooting, appeared on Capitol Hill on Monday with a pointed message for her colleagues in Congress, which she delivered with a raised fist: \u201cThe nation is counting on you.\u201d Credit Jonathan Ernst/Reuters \u201cWe are stuck,\u201d said Representative Linda T. S\u00e1nchez of California, the vice chairwoman of the House Democratic caucus. \u201cWe have asked time and time again of our Republican counterparts to please engage in this discussion of how do we stop gun violence, and they are completely unwilling to do anything to help us out on that issue.\u201d\n Congress is, in fact, not completely stuck \u2014 even on difficult issues framed in terms of life and death. House Republicans on Tuesday took up legislation to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The House just passed legislation 237-189.\nThe contrasting action and inaction \u2014 on abortion and gun control \u2014 spotlighted the stark politics of \u201clife\u201d in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting. As they debated the abortion bill, members of both parties juxtaposed the two issues.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy Opt out or contact us anytime Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, who was at a congressional baseball practice in June when a gunman opened fire, nearly killing a senior Republican, said that the gun issue was \u201cseparate\u201d from the abortion debate.\nBut Republicans who praised emergency medical workers in Las Vegas also repurposed that praise in the abortion debate. \u201cThese are little boys and little girls waiting to be born,\u201d said Representative Mike Kelly, Republican of Pennsylvania, in a speech in the House defending the abortion ban. \u201cIf we do not stand for them, who will stand for them? If we are not the first responders, who will be the first responders?\u201d\nRepresentative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, was incredulous.\n\u201cThere is this absolute silence on the deaths that have been created through guns and irresponsible gun ownership and yet here we are somehow talking about the sanctity of life when it relates to abortions,\u201d she said.\nRepresentative Louise Slaughter, a Democrat of New York, put in bluntly. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything else to call it but pure hypocrisy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe love it until it\u2019s born and then it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s problem.\u201d\nSo far, Republicans in the House have shown no interest in any additional legislation that would limit guns. Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the third-ranking House Republican nearly killed by a gunman in June, reappeared Tuesday at a House Republican leadership news conference. He said nothing about gun legislation.\nIn an interview with Fox News, Mr. Scalise said that what he saw in Las Vegas \u201cfortified\u201d his stance in support of the Second Amendment.\n Senator John Thune, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, did tell an NBC News reporter that lawmakers \u201cought to take a look at\u201d conversion kits that can make guns more lethal. But Mr. Thune also suggested little could be achieved through legislation.\n\u201cI think people are going to have to take steps in their own lives to take precautions,\u201d he said. \u201cTo protect themselves. And in situations like that, you know, try to stay safe. As somebody said \u2014 get small.\u201d\nSome gun safety advocates acknowledged that expanding background checks would not have prevented the massacre in Las Vegas. Among them was Lori Hankey Haas, whose daughter was wounded in the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007.\n\u201cIs there a single policy that would have prevented this particular mass shooting?\u201d asked Ms. Haas, who is now the Virginia state director for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, an advocacy group. \u201cI doubt it seriously. But it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t try.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve scalise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giffords", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabrielle giffords", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lori hankey haas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "responsible solutions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coalition to stop gun violence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house republican", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:32:36.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "82e15f52ffe80becb4217b0802ebc92fb00a23f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxxQbOF6qH5Z1GcVFhIXB4QLagsER4kKdPQSqN3.RbsK3E_iPTVbpzbXXNPo1ltDABxsG34BHuBDM-", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://nytimes.com/timeswire/feeds/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NYT > Most Recent Headlines", "title": "Krugman on Cholera Tweet: \u2018I Got Sloppy\u2019", "title_full": "Krugman on Cholera Tweet: \u2018I Got Sloppy\u2019", "published": "2017-10-03T22:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/26/us/04bulletin_krugman/27xp-help-facebookJumbo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 64, "comments": 0, "shares": 64}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "82e15f52ffe80becb4217b0802ebc92fb00a23f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxxQbOF6qH5Z1GcVFhIXB4QLagsER4kKdPQSqN3.RbsK3E_iPTVbpzbXXNPo1ltDABxsG34BHuBDM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T22:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Krugman on Cholera Tweet: \u2018I Got Sloppy\u2019", "text": "Krugman on Cholera Tweet: \u2018I Got Sloppy\u2019 OCT. 3, 2017 Continue reading the main story Photo Members of the National Guard distribute water and food after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.

Dear Watchers, Hulu recently added the former TGIF lineup to its streaming options, so if you\u2019ve been dying to return to an early \u201990s head space, well, it\u2019s time to do your dance of joy: \u201cBoy Meets World,\u201d \u201cDinosaurs,\u201d \u201cFamily Matters,\u201d \u201cFull House,\u201d \u201cHangin\u2019 With Mr. Cooper,\u201d \u201cPerfect Strangers,\u201d \u201cSabrina the Teenage Witch\u201d and \u201cStep by Step\u201d are all available. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve thought about \u201cStep by Step\u201d since I was also filling out Scholastic Book Club orders, but it\u2019s nice to know the archive is available. Also available: More than 1,000 handpicked movie and TV recommendations on Watching . We add new ones all the time. Not sure what you\u2019re in the mood for? Perhaps you\u2019d like something about historical women taking care of business . Have a robust week. See you Friday. Tuesday When to watch: 8:30 p.m., on ABC. Save To Watch Like Heart Shape \u201cFresh Off the Boat\u201d has the rhythms of more cartoonish shows, even as it has the setting and ambience of a single-camera family comedy. Its fourth season premiere is an accessible spot for jumping in, especially if you like \u201990s pop culture. 0 The episode includes some good \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d material, but my favorite line comes at the expense of a \u201cBaby-Sitters Club\u201d book. The embittered, erudite youngest brother, Evan, picks one up off a bookshelf. \u201c\u2018Logan Likes Mary Anne\u2019?\u201d he says derisively. \u201cSo?\u201d I strongly believe that this show would make so many more people happy for 22 minutes a week if only they would give it a try. \u2018The Mayor\u2019When to watch: 9:30 p.m., on ABC. Save To Watch Like Heart Shape In a year of miserable pilots, a \u201cHey, not bad!\u201d is king. Or in this case, mayor. This new single-camera comedy from ABC starts with an episode that\u2019s almost all setup, explaining how the aspiring rapper Courtney (Brandon Micheal Hall) became mayor of his California town. Despite this case of pilot-itis, the show\u2019s sunny demeanor shines through. If you like \u201c black-ish \u201d or \u201c Speechless ,\u201d give this a go. \u2018Kevin (Probably) Saves the World\u2019When to watch: 10 p.m., on ABC. Save To Watch Like Heart Shape ABC has a long legacy of giving shows dreadful names (\u201cCougar Town,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Trust the B \u2014 in Apt. 23,\u201d \u201cG.C.B.\u201d), and this season is no different. This show was once known as \u201cThe Gospel of Kevin,\u201d and that seems a little closer, but too late now. Jason Ritter stars as the mopey Kevin, who returns to his Texas hometown after a suicide attempt in order to live with his recently widowed sister (JoAnna Garcia Swisher) and her salty teen daughter (Chloe East). But mid-moping, he\u2019s suddenly contacted by a guardian angel who tells him he as a special mission, from (a nondenominational) God, to restore a kind of goodness in the world. The pilot is a little all over the place, and many of its beats are too predictable, but there are glimmers here of a sweet, occasionally cheeky supernatural dramedy. There\u2019s an \u201cEli Stone\u201d vibe, with tiny twinkles of \u201cBeing Erica\u201d or \u201cWonderfalls.\u201d Throw in a dash of \u201cMy Name Is Earl,\u201d because, like Earl, Kevin is trying to better himself after a not-great run. And sprinkle liberally with some \u201cReaper\u201d (which hails from the creative team that made \u201cKevin\u201d), a show in which an audacious premise gets folded into an otherwise mostly ordinary existence. Against my better judgment, I liked it. Also Tuesday : The rest of the ABC comedy block is back, too: \u201c The Middle,\u201d at 8 p.m., and \u201c black-ish ,\u201d at 9. \u201c Queen Sugar \u201d is back at 10 p.m., on OWN.

But it's on the schedule for the new season as The National, and PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan says it's not coming off. \"We made the commitment,\" Monahan said. \"Our players are going to be showing up there and we're going to be playing for that amount of money ($7.1 million). The tournament, run by the Tiger Woods Foundation, originally was scheduled to return to Congressional for 2018. But with uncertainly over title sponsorship, the PGA Tour decided to opt out its contract with the club for 2018 and 2020. Why opt out with such certainty of playing in 2018? Monahan said there is no guarantee the National will be played in 2019 and beyond. Being tied to a golf course \u2014 even one as storied as Congressional \u2014 might limit any negotiations. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story \"Let's say we didn't renew with Quicken and there was another sponsor and they had a different objective. They wanted to be at a different golf course, a different part of town. They wanted to do something different,\" Monahan said. \"You can't be wed to one golf course that might limit your ability to get a deal done.\" Continue reading the main story The tournament remains in contact with Quicken Loans, and there are conversations with other potential sponsors. Still on the table is a scenario in which Detroit-based Quicken Loans might be interested in having the PGA Tour closer to its headquarters. But that would be after 2018. Monahan went from \"highly, highly likely\" to \"it's for sure in D.C. \u2014 I can say that\" for the National to be held in Washington this season, with or without a title sponsor. The course has not been determined. It was played last year at TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm. The Houston Open also is without a title sponsor. Finding replacements is a priority for the PGA Tour, along with concern that Bridgestone might not renew its title sponsorship after next year of the World Golf Championship event at Firestone. ___ PRESIDENTS CUP DOWN UNDER: The PGA Tour announced that the dates for the 2019 Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne will be Dec. 12-15, two days later than the conclusion of the matches the first time it went to Australia in 1998. Still to be determined is the cutoff for qualifying for the team, and when to announce the captains' picks. This will be the fourth time the Presidents Cup goes to the Southern Hemisphere, but the first since the PGA Tour went to a wraparound season. This year, the 10 automatic spots were determined on Sept. 4 after the second FedEx Cup playoff event \u2014 three weeks ahead of the matches. If the cutoff is the Tour Championship in 2019 \u2014 that presumably will be Labor Day \u2014 then the U.S. team would be set three months before the opening tee shot. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story When the PGA Tour first took the Presidents Cup to Australia, the cutoff for qualifying was the Tour Championship. But that was on Nov. 1, just five weeks ahead of the Presidents Cup. The cutoff for qualifying again was the Tour Championship when the matches were at Royal Melbourne in 2011. That was Sept. 25, two months before the Presidents Cup (Nov. 22-25). That was when the tour had the Fall Series to allow players a chance to earn their card. Tiger Woods was a captain's pick and wound up playing the Frys.com Open to get his game sharp. Several Americans also played the week before in either the Singapore Open or Australian Open.

It wouldn't make any sense to decide a team three months before the Presidents Cup. Then again, it could lead players to add fall events to the schedule to avoid being left off. ___ PERFECT STORM: Ben Crane rolled the dice by staying home from the Web.com Tour Championship and wound up losing. Until he realized he didn't lose much at all. Crane already had a bizarre time in the Web.Com Tour Finals when he was penalized eight shots and eventually disqualified for having practice stickers on his clubs that he forgot to remove. He was No. 18 on the Finals money list and seemingly in good shape to finish among the top 25, which are awarded PGA Tour cards. So he pulled out of the final event, spending his weekend at the Presidents Cup for Citi. Jonathan Byrd won. Sam Saunders and Shawn Stefani tied for second. Before he knew it, eight players did well enough to move past him. And it didn't help that eight others withdrew because they already had cards locked up. When the Tour Championship was pushed to Monday, they wanted to get to California for the Thursday start of the new season at the Safeway Open. Bad news? Not really. With his conditional status \u2014 Crane finished 147th in the FedEx Cup \u2014 he figured he would miss only a couple of tournaments he normally plays. And then it got better. Four players ahead of him in the FedEx Cup earned cards at the Web.com Finals. Five others already were exempt through winning within the last two years. Now, he's not in much different position than if he had gone to Florida for the final event and earned his card. ___ LPGA MANTRA: The slogan for the LPGA Tour is \"See Why It's Different.\" But there's another one at LPGA Tour headquarters, mainly used internally, that might be even more meaningful. Heather Daly-Donofrio, the chief communications and operations officer, signs off her emails with \"Act Like a Founder.\" \nAdvertisement \"It's part of our internal culture,\" he said. \"We're here because of our 13 founders, and our job is to carry that forward with the same grit and determination. Everyone has really latched onto it.\" It's more than just a motto. For the last four years, the staff nominates an employee for the \"Act Like a Founder\" award, and the management team chooses the winner. The staff member is honored at the holiday party, gets a plaque signed by the living founders and wins a trip to the Founders Cup, where they go to the dinner honoring pioneers. \"For the people who have won it,\" Daly-Donofrio said, \"it's emotional when they get it.\" ___ DIVOTS: Michelle Wie is sufficiently healed from her appendectomy and plans to play the final six LPGA Tour events. Five of them are in Asia, starting next week in South Korea, wrapped up by the CME Group Tour Championship in Florida. ... Dustin Johnson finished at No. 3 on the PGA Tour money list last season. But he led the tour in average earnings per start at $436,610 in his 20 tournaments. ... Thomas Bjorn and Arjun Atwal will be captains at the EurAsia Cup, to be played Jan. 12-14 in Malaysia. Europe won 18\u00bd-5\u00bd in 2016. The first event in 2014 ended in a tie. ... Americans won 33 of the 48 events on the PGA Tour this year, up from 24 out of 47 the previous year. ___ STAT OF THE WEEK: Since the start of the wraparound season in October 2013, Brendan Steele last year is the only player to win the season-opening tournament and not reach the Tour Championship. ___ FINAL WORD: \"They got better at doing what Europe does than what Europe did. And we paid the price.\" \u2014 Geoff Ogilvy on the U.S. team spirit at the Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup in recent years.

The suppliers, in turn, agreed to pay the legal minimum wage and to ensure workers\u2019 rights and safety. The program has been widely credited with improving working conditions in an industry where human trafficking flourished until recently.

Credit Caleb Kenna for The New York Times The 1,200 to 1,500 workers in Vermont\u2019s dairy industry have been laboring under their own grim circumstances. A 2014 survey of about 170 dairy workers in the state by Migrant Justice, the farmworkers\u2019 advocacy group that signed the agreement with Ben & Jerry\u2019s, found that in addition to a scarcity of days off, workers had schedules that frequently kept them from sleeping more than a few hours at a time. Many of the migrants, who typically work year round for low wages and live on the farms that employ them, also had substandard housing. \u201cOne of the biggest issues was housing conditions, the need for workers to be provided with basic amenities, like electricity, water, and housing that is free from pest infestations,\u201d said Enrique Balcazar, a former dairy worker who has helped lead the organizing effort, speaking through a translator. The workers tend to be undocumented, making it difficult for them to speak out. Under the program, called Milk With Dignity, workers at dairy farms that supply Ben & Jerry\u2019s will have the right to one day off a week and will earn at least the state minimum wage, currently $10 an hour . Workers will also be guaranteed at least eight consecutive hours of rest between shifts and housing accommodations that include a bed and access to electricity and clean running water. The agreement requires Ben & Jerry\u2019s to acquire its milk from farms that adhere to the standards. It will be enforced in part by the affected workers, who will be informed of their rights and encouraged to report violations to a 24-hour hotline. Compliance will be monitored by a group led by a former staff lawyer at the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Immigrant Justice Project, which will conduct audits. Ben & Jerry\u2019s will effectively finance the benefits by paying an undisclosed premium on the milk it buys, based on volume.

In \u201cThe Naughty Nineties,\u201d David Friend turns instead to the 1990s, when those same baby boomers were in positions of greater power: from Bill Clinton in the White House to Howard Stern on the radio to the producers Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jonathan Murray on MTV with \u201cThe Real World.\u201d Friend finds that the decade\u2019s sexual and political attitudes shaped, in ways both progressive and conservative, the ground we stand on today. On one side are widespread moves to the left on social issues. \u201cBut a good case can be made,\u201d he also writes, that Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency \u201cwould never have been possible had the 1990s not normalized and formalized personal branding, reality programming, 24/7 news, tabloid scandal coverage and online self-expression.\u201d Below, Friend discusses how Viagra inspired the book, how the election of Trump changed his plans and more. When did you first get the idea to write this book? The idea came out of a dinner I had with a friend, who\u2019s a cardiologist, in 2004. He was telling me the back story of the discovery of Viagra. It started as a drug for hypertension. But the patients in the trials, in the early and mid \u201990s, they had this little side effect. Many of the subjects were not giving the pills back after the trial stopped. And so I said, I\u2019d really love to interview the people who were involved: the chemists, the marketing teams, the patients. I was raising two kids in the \u201990s, and there was this constant sexual overlay on popular culture and the news. So I said, \u201cWhat is going on in this dumbing down of the culture and in this coarseness of public discourse?\u201d I was looking at this era when the boomers took over. My peers were coming of age in Washington and Hollywood and Madison Avenue. What if I could find others like these people involved with Viagra? What about the sexual crusaders of the internet? What about the seven Brazilian sisters who invented the Brazilian bikini wax? What if I could find Michael J. Peter , who invented the upscale gentlemen\u2019s club? And what if I could get to Paula Jones? From that one dinner conversation about an intended heart drug grew this concept of the \u201990s as a naughty decade. What\u2019s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it? I was writing a book about the Clinton years during the Obama years. I was convinced, when I sat down to my interviews and began my writing, that the left had won; that America, red states and blue, in its cultural attitudes, had shifted left of center. In the \u201990s you had L.G.B.T. rights being supported, you had a spirit of inclusion under two terms of Clinton. You had the first cases, in Hawaii and then in Vermont, for same-sex unions being made legal. And in popular culture you had all this, for better and for worse, sex and violence almost as a matter of course.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david friend", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "michael j. peter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary-ellis bunim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald j. trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "howard stern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paula jones", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "photo credit patricia wall/the new york times", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mtv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosetta", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vermont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madison avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:32:10.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ffca64bb916dea6114a098fc6cc4df1375355d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxxQbOF6qH5Z1eBZ1Ti8Ib40nTj_rXh6p26.kufgfJTa8qACa.uxkSgPQA26OKMDXO9NyMPTwkRRd9EHgsVRXNSaHtXw.wGsla6jHeK71JqfM-", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://nytimes.com/timeswire/feeds/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NYT > Most Recent Headlines", "title": "De Blasio Appoints Acting Commissioner to Head City Jails", "title_full": "De Blasio Appoints Acting Commissioner to Head City Jails", "published": "2017-10-04T00:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 58, "comments": 0, "shares": 58}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 44}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8ffca64bb916dea6114a098fc6cc4df1375355d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxxQbOF6qH5Z1eBZ1Ti8Ib40nTj_rXh6p26.kufgfJTa8qACa.uxkSgPQA26OKMDXO9NyMPTwkRRd9EHgsVRXNSaHtXw.wGsla6jHeK71JqfM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "J.

She replaced Mr. Ponte on a temporary basis after his departure in June.\n\u201cWe thought she combined alignment on vision with real experience in making the changes and reforms needed,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said of Ms. Brann during an unrelated news conference on Tuesday. \u201cShe knew the job, she knew the system, she knew the people. And I liked her approach to leadership.\u201d\nThe Correction Department is still plagued by persistent episodes of violence by some inmates and staff at Rikers Island, where a raft of reforms, federal oversight and steady investment have yet to create a stable atmosphere. The department has also been tasked by Mr. de Blasio with making changes that, along with reforms across a range of law enforcement agencies and courts, would result in the closing of Rikers Island as a jail complex after 10 years .\n Glenn E. Martin, who has led protests in favor of closing Rikers, said in a statement that City Hall should have hired an outside candidate for commissioner and that the choice of a current city correction official \u201csuggests that the mayor still fails to grasp the urgency of shuttering New York\u2019s torture island.\u201d\nThe head of the correction officers union, Elias Husamudeen, said Ms. Brann had a front-row seat to the \u201cfailed reform policies of her predecessor,\u201d and he expressed hope that she \u201cwill listen to the concerns and recommendations of the men and women who serve on the front lines of the city\u2019s jails.\u201d\nCity Hall searched broadly for a replacement for Mr. Ponte, who left amid a scandal surrounding his use of city-owned vehicles and a gas card for personal use, including trips back to a home he owned in Maine. Mr. Ponte and Mr. de Blasio have bristled at the suggestion of deliberate misuse or that Mr. Ponte had been forced to resign.\n \u201cCommissioner Ponte was not dismissed, let\u2019s be clear, and it wasn\u2019t because of a mistake around some cars,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said on Tuesday in response to a question. \u201cIt was time for him to retire. Let\u2019s try to be accurate.\u201d\nMore than 20 correction employees \u2014 including Mr. Ponte and Ms. Brann \u2014 were accused by investigators from the city\u2019s Investigation Department of improperly using city vehicles.\nNewsletter Sign Up\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Ms. Brann has reimbursed the city for her misuse of the car.\nSeveral candidates were considered before City Hall chose Ms. Brann, who served for more than two decades at the Maine Department of Corrections before becoming deputy commissioner for quality assurance at the city\u2019s Correction Department in 2015. Ms. Brann\u2019s appointment was reported by Politico New York.\nAt one point, officials appeared to be strongly considering Dan Pacholke , who had spent three decades with the Washington State Department of Correction. City officials went so far as to tour Rikers Island with Mr. Pacholke. Vincent Schiraldi, who led the city\u2019s Probation Department under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, was also considered.\nA spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio declined to comment on the candidates, beyond saying that \u201cnearly a dozen people were seriously considered.\u201d Asked if any had been offered the job before Ms. Brann, Mr. de Blasio said \u201cno.\u201d\n\u201cThe offer was made to acting Commissioner Brann because as we evaluated her work, and talked through with her her vision, I became convinced she was the right person for the job,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.\nCity Hall officials cited her work in making organizational changes and in helping to roll out a new policy for when guards use force.\nFaced with pressure from the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, and from outside groups, Mr. de Blasio promised to close the jail complex in a decade. While he has not provided details , the mayor has said the plan will create jails in several boroughs \u2014 but not Staten Island.\nElected officials in Queens said on Monday they would support a new jail near the courthouse in that borough.

It arrives every year at this time, for two weeks, at New York City Center. It presents five programs, each with four items from different areas of dance. Dance from outside New York and from other countries is part of the mix; so are commissioned premieres. Whatever your existing ideas of dance are, they should be extended in some way by each season \u2014 and it\u2019s fine to dislike a few items along the way.\nProgram A, which opened on Monday, was a neat example of the formula\u2019s eclectic nature: 21st-century ballet; an African dance solo drawing on bird imagery; a classic of New York postmodern dance by Trisha Brown , who died this year; and the world premiere of a big new group work by the tap creator Michelle Dorrance. The opening work had originally been a commission from the young choreographer Troy Schumacher for Miami City Ballet. Although he completed it this summer, Miami City Ballet and City Center felt that it \u201cwas not ready to be performed at City Center,\u201d a spokesman for City Center said. This is odd, as City Center has presented plenty of unready works in the past.\nIt was replaced with perhaps the most familiar 21st-century ballet, Christopher Wheeldon\u2019s \u201c Polyphonia \u201d (2001), which is danced all over the world and has often been seen at City Center and Lincoln Center. (New York City Ballet dances it this week.) Miami City performed it at Jacob\u2019s Pillow in June, and I\u2019m afraid that on Monday my mind kept glazing over. \u201cPolyphonia\u201d is a very polished assortment of choreographic \u00e9tudes, with plenty of the over-partnering that has become a Wheeldon hallmark. While you can see why it put Mr. Wheeldon on the map, it does not reward multiple viewings.\nWith great charm, Vincent Sekwati Koko Mantsoe danced his own solo \u201cGula,\u201d first made in 1993. This is a slight but affable piece in which he makes a range of whistle and click noises as he becomes birdlike before our eyes \u2014 often in wading steps with torso bent forward toward the floor. The reverence of man for bird becomes touching.\nPhoto Jamie Scott, left, and Cecily Campbell of Trisha Brown Dance Company in \u201cYou can see us.\u201d Credit Andrea Mohin/The New York Times The revival of the duet (or double solo) \u201cYou Can See Us\u201d commemorates the death of Trisha Brown, who often used to dance with her company on this stage, and who was one of nature\u2019s superlative soloists. This item began life as \u201c If you couldn\u2019t see me \u201d (1994), a solo in which Brown moved with her back to the audience throughout. It became \u201cYou can see us\u201d (1995) when she juxtaposed it with a simultaneous performance of the same solo, but with the second dancer facing the audience from the other side of the stage. Brown performed it with a man (Bill T. Jones or Mikhail Baryshnikov); now it\u2019s given by two women, Cecily Campbell and Jamie Scott of the Trisha Brown Company.\nThough Brown danced with more juice than these two, this remains an intriguing, odd, witty piece (and impressive in how the two, with no musical cues, keep moving at exactly the same speed without seeing each other). Though the Brown idiom is notable for the fluidity of its dance current, I love the angles with which it\u2019s punctuated. Near the end, each dancer stands still with one leg and one elbow bent, then transfers all her weight onto the other leg, now bent, and bends the arm on that side. You and I could do that move in the living room, but could we make it interesting? Here it\u2019s just one passing detail amid hundreds.\nPhoto Byron Tittle and Michelle Dorrance in \u201cMyelination.\u201d Credit Andrea Mohin/The New York Times Rhythm keeps accumulating and multiplying in \u201cMyelination,\u201d the Dorrance premiere; it\u2019s an exhilarating ensemble piece, including solos and duets, that switches gears from section to section. Most lovable is its inclusiveness: dancers of different races, of widely unalike temperaments and couture, coexist calmly here, often in exactly the same intricate meter but sometimes in overlapping sequences and facing separate directions. The live music \u2014 with vocals, piano, guitar, percussion and other instruments \u2014 is in a range of appealingly melodic jazz styles; its harmony with the dancing is never simple. Ms. Dorrance\u2019s own persona, so happily tough, is part of the piece\u2019s surprising theatricality.

The thick Mayo brogue and quick laugh. He was standing to my right, and he had kind eyes and punky, bleached-blonde hair. He wasn\u2019t the moody Pierre of my fantasies, but at least we could talk to each other. He had been living in Paris for four years and spoke fluent French, so there was that at least. He encouraged me to get away from my landlord, and soon I found my own place in the Marais with an Australian girl. After six months, my French improved to the point that Parisian shopkeepers stopped pretending they didn\u2019t speak English; content that I had made a good enough effort in their own language, they would speak to me in mine, no matter how much I persisted in French. I found a hidden spot on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 where I would pass hours on weekend mornings reading and watching people stroll along the banks of the Seine. I walked through the halls of the Louvre, the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, the Pompidou and Mus\u00e9e Rodin in awe. My modeling work had finally picked up. I was growing up and learning about the world. There is a moment in your story when you can pinpoint the exact time you fell in love, be it with a place or a person. I can remember both like it was yesterday. I had just left a casting where I had, again, been humiliatingly rejected in front of 20 of my peers. Choking back tears I had rushed out of the building and ran to a nearby park hoping to find a secluded spot. My eyes burning, willing myself to get it together, I looked up to the sky hoping for some divine comfort and suddenly everything stopped. I realized I was surrounded by the most beautiful square, Place des Vosges. With its rose-hued walls, the square softly glowed in the sunlight and radiated calm and beauty. My sobs subsided, and I was hit with the most over powering sense of gratitude. I forgot about the casting director who had just reduced me to nothing. I wasn\u2019t nothing. I was a young Irish woman, and I was here, realizing a dream and living in the most beautiful city in the world. My parallel love story \u2014 the one with my Irish boyfriend \u2014 was solidified one night with a dreamy kiss outside the Panth\u00e9on. I was madly in love with a man and a city, both inextricably intertwined. My boyfriend, however, had itchy feet. He longed to be somewhere quiet and rural. I followed him to the Alps, but I soon felt caged in by the mountains and the trees. I wanted loud markets, bustling streets. We argued and argued, one person\u2019s dreams tugging against the other\u2019s. I headed back to Paris. He stayed in the mountains. Eventually, though, I would move on \u2014 to London, New York, Los Angeles and then Glasgow, each with their own magic and beauty. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But on certain sunny days, I am always brought back to my bench in Place des Vosges, and my heart swells for a beat.

In the Ramayana, a central epic of Hinduism, Lord Rama crosses a bridge from here to rescue his wife, Sita, from the demon king Ravana in Sri Lanka. Credit Atul Loke for The New York Times DHANUSHKODI, India \u2014 At dawn, a procession of buses sped past coconut huts, past fishermen unfurling nets and through the ghost town of Dhanushkodi \u2014 leveled in a powerful hurricane in 1964 \u2014 before stopping at a stretch of beach where, according to Hindu mythology, an ancient bridge once stood. As day broke, barrel-chested businessmen filed into the ocean, reciting mantras. Hindu priests, clad in white, dropped to their knees to lead funereal ceremonies for families who had lost an uncle, a father. A cluster of teenagers wandered over the dunes. For centuries, pilgrims from the Indian cities of Chennai, Mumbai and Patna, and a few from London, have traveled to the tip of a thumbnail island in southern India. It is here that the Ramayana , a central epic for Hindus, says Lord Rama crossed a bridge called Rama Setu to rescue his wife Sita from the demon king Ravana in modern Sri Lanka, a contemporary distance of about 20 miles. The trip to Dhanushkodi is a bit easier for pilgrims today. They no longer have to walk or go by four-wheel-drive vehicles to the site. There is now a blacktop road with reflectors and a direct train line connecting pilgrimage sites in northern India to Rameswaram, a port town near Dhanushkodi. The line, inaugurated this summer with a speech by Prime Minister Narendra Modi near its terminus, covers about 1,700 miles.

Spartan accommodation in ashrams has made way for a Hyatt hotel and tour groups of as many as 1,200 people. The government seems to have caught on as well, erecting block-lettered signs announcing the history of many more local sites of interest: the place where Sita quenched her thirst, the spot where Rama bathed. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Recently, a team of researchers announced their intention to conduct an underwater exploration of Rama Setu, to determine once and for all whether the formations clearly visible on the ocean floor are naturally occurring sandbanks or structures made by humans. Alok Tripathi, an archaeologist who drafted the proposal, told the Indian news media he was \u201c100 percent sure we will find archaeological remains.\u201d Continue reading the main story Many of those pushing to explore the site have stopped short of saying they hope to find Rama Setu. But some historians warn that politicians have deliberately played down hard scientific evidence for the soft power gained by developing pilgrimage sites. As far-right Hindu leaders gain traction in India, some see Rama Setu as a case study in ideological excavation. Photo The Pamban Bridge, which connects Rameswaram to mainland India. Credit Atul Loke for The New York Times \u201cIf you\u2019re claiming that there was a bridge, go and excavate it, get the scientific data, put it through scientific analysis and see what it is,\u201d said Romila Thapar, an Indian historian. \u201cBut don\u2019t just say something was there.\u201d She added: \u201cLet\u2019s face it, the pilgrimage places have a dual role. They always have a role for religion and for commerce.\u201d Some 2,000 years ago (the date is the subject of debate), the sage Valmiki wrote a highly regarded version of the Ramayana, a reflection on Rama\u2019s life, as a poem. But multiple renditions of the narrative exist in Buddhism, Jainism and across Southeast Asia. Details of Rama\u2019s rescue mission vary, depending on which source is consulted. Meenakshi Jain, the author of a book examining the story of Rama , said many ordinary Indians viewed Hindu epics as itihas, or a record of history. She said it was important for scholars \u201cnot to belittle or ridicule\u201d different streams of belief. \u201cThe epics may or may not have a historical kernel,\u201d she said. \u201cRational minds can distinguish what is a historical fact and what may not be. But they are conscious that myths convey a message that we should try to grasp.\u201d Continue reading the main story Photo The Ramanathaswamy temple in Rameswaram is one of the most important pilgrimage sites for followers of Hinduism.

When plans were proposed to break apart the marine formation to build a shipping canal in 2007, politicians \u2014 many from the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which is now in power \u2014 organized protests . The Archaeological Survey of India filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court claiming that no evidence existed proving that the bridge had been constructed by people. After a bit of push and pull, the project was halted. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story A trip to the site takes visitors through ruins of another kind. After the cyclone tore through Dhanushkodi, killing nearly the entire population, little was rebuilt. There is the skeleton of a church, sinking in the sand, and the remains of a railway station. Some claim the bridge, too, was uprooted from the seafloor by the storm. Photo A tourist shop in Rameswaram. Credit Atul Loke for The New York Times At the edge of the beach on a cloudy morning, not much was visible apart from distant patches of land belonging to Sri Lanka. A group of sinewy fishermen ripping shells from a net said they had no idea what was submerged in their fishing grounds. When they venture out in dinghies to catch tuna under moonlight, the water is impossibly dark, they said. But the lack of a clear visual did not deter residents and pilgrims from describing, sometimes in elaborate, contradictory detail, what the bridge looks like. First, there is the question of its size. Estimates of the number of stones used in its primeval construction ranged from 1,000 to 20,000. Grilling fish on the side of the road, Kumar Kali, 36, methodically broke down the math for his own dubious calculation: if three feet of bridge contained about 50 stones, he supposed, the total number beneath the water should fall close to 3,000.

Ravi Chandran, 50, a temple employee, cited a NASA satellite image , which locals sporadically attribute to American scientists in Chicago. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d he said, referring to the bridge. \u201cI won\u2019t lie. But there is a huge picture of Rama Setu outside the ashram.

As children peered wide-eyed into the tank, Kandan, 31, a caretaker who goes by one name, related a story he had heard in which the machinery used to dig up the actual stones crumbled into pieces. \u201cRama\u2019s bridge,\u201d he said, \u201cIndia cannot touch it.\u201d Photo Fishermen at Dhanushkodi beach.

Now, there are three-story buildings and air-conditioning.\u201d As thousands gathered near Rameswaram this summer for Mr. Modi\u2019s speech inaugurating the train line, the prime minister evoked the bridge to make a point about development. \u201cThe Ramayana tells us the story of a little squirrel, the little squirrel from Rameswaram that helped in building Rama Setu,\u201d he said. \u201cA squirrel can inspire us all.

While the film includes footage of Ms. Vargas onstage and recordings of her music, it doesn\u2019t convey the power of her artistry, giving the viewer a sense of why, to paraphrase the musician Miguel Bos\u00e9 from the film, listeners might believe that she could die from being overwhelmed in the middle of a song.

Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed Although she became known for her performances of ranchera, especially songs by the composer Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez, Ms. Vargas eschewed the flamboyant hoop skirts and jewelry associated with performers of the genre, wearing pants and earning a reputation for, as it\u2019s described in the film, \u201csinging like a man.\u201d She didn\u2019t come out as a lesbian until the age of 81, but according to the film, her sexuality was no secret. We hear about how she swooned over Frida Kahlo, among many other women. Severe alcoholism stalled her career, until a cabaret performance in Mexico City in the early 1990s rekindled the spark and eventually led to fresh international acclaim. (She did not perform much in the United States; The New York Times interviewed her in 2003 on the occasion of her Carnegie Hall debut at the age of 83.)\n\u201cChavela lived in a continual state of farewell,\u201d says the director Pedro Almod\u00f3var, who befriended the singer in her later life and used her songs in some of his films.

Visitors can piece together a fish and have it scanned and digitized at an iPad station \u2014 and then see it come to life as it swims on the screen. iPad scanners at activities are linked to visitors\u2019 wristbands, so each creation can be stored and revisited from home through the Lego House app. Tickets to the experience zones (199 kroner per person, about $31) grant entry at specific time blocks, though once inside the house, visitors can stay as long as they like.

Credit Jim Mcisaac/Getty Images The Mets\u2019 reckoning with their disappointing season continued Tuesday, when they announced the dismissal of their pitching coach and their head athletic trainer.\nThe pitching coach, Dan Warthen, and the head trainer, Ray Ramirez, were both longtime employees. Sandy Alderson, the team\u2019s general manager, said the Mets would \u201creorganize and restructure\u201d the medical and training staffs for next season.\nIn addition to finding a replacement for Ramirez, Alderson said, the Mets would bolster the department and alter the responsibilities and reporting structure so \u201cthe front office and the baseball staff have current and meaningful information, and players are getting the best possible care.\u201d\nWhat was supposed to be a promising 2017 season devolved into a nightmare of struggles and infirmities, and the Mets instead finished fourth in the National League East with a 70-92 record.\n Pitching was the backbone of the team during its run to the 2015 World Series and to a 2016 wild-card playoff appearance. But injuries to pitchers like Noah Syndergaard, Matt Harvey and Jeurys Familia, and the regression of pitchers such as Robert Gsellman and Harvey, deeply undermined the Mets this season. They finished with a 5.01 earned run average, second worst in team history.\n Warthen was a mainstay of the organization, having served as the pitching coach since midway through 2008. After a rough season, the Mets opted for a new voice in the position, much as they did with Terry Collins, who stepped aside f rom his job as the manager on Sunday.\nCollins, whose background is in player development, will remain with the Mets as a special assistant to Alderson with a focus on young players.\n\u201cI was disappointed with the performance of some of those players and their preparations for playing at the major league level,\u201d Alderson said. \u201cI think this is an area where Terry can be very helpful.\u201d\nAlderson added later: \u201cJust as we didn\u2019t have a good season at the major league level, we didn\u2019t have a particularly good season at the minor league level either, and that needs to be reviewed.\u201d\nWarthen, who was publicly and forcefully supported by Syndergaard, was offered another unspecified position in the organization, but he had not accepted it as of Tuesday morning, and he may pursue jobs elsewhere.\nAlderson called Warthen \u201can outstanding pitching coach,\u201d but said that \u201cgiven the state of our pitching this year and the fact we were changing managers, we felt it was important at this point to go in a new direction.\u201d\nThe Mets finished sixth in games missed in M.L.B. this season with 1,365 spent on the disabled list, according to ManGamesLost.com , a site that tracks injuries. But factoring in the importance of the injured players, the Mets ranked higher, and have since 2010.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Barwis has a complex at the team\u2019s spring training facility in Port St. Lucie, Fla.\nCespedes trained in the off-season and performed his midseason rehabilitation under Barwis\u2019s care, but still suffered recurring leg injuries this season. Alderson said Cespedes\u2019s inconsistent daily training program was at fault, not Barwis.\n\u201cI\u2019m very comfortable with Mike and his role with us, and he\u2019s a tremendously important part of what we do,\u201d Alderson said.\nSince Syndergaard refused a magnetic resonance imaging examination in late April for right biceps soreness and soon after tore his right latissimus, an injury that cost him four months, Alderson met with the medical and training staffs almost daily.\nWhat needs to change is the process, said Alderson, who added that he believed the medical and training operations had improved \u201csubstantially\u201d during the season.\nOver the weekend, some players who were injured this season offered suggestions.\nErik Goeddel, a reliever, said he had trouble extending his arm straight for half of last season because of a bone spur that was only discovered and removed in November, when he received his first M.R.I. exam for it. During the season, he said, he told the medical staff that it did not feel like tendinitis, which was the original diagnosis.\n\u201cGoing back, if I had something like that, I\u2019d just ask for an M.R.I. immediately,\u201d Goeddel said. \u201cThat would have solved all those problems. You live and learn. At the same time, there are plenty of guys getting hurt for the first time, and if it takes getting hurt and having something stupid happen to realize how to do it better, that\u2019s not good because a bunch of guys are missing time they didn\u2019t need to or playing hurt and not performing as well.\u201d\n Regarding any improvements he would recommend, Syndergaard said: \u201cCommunication would be the biggest part. That\u2019s going to clean up everything. Communication between the G.M., owners, training staff, coaching staff, everything.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt harvey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dan warthen", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "robert gsellman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terry collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandy alderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeurys familia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warthen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noah syndergaard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ray ramirez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mets", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "credit jim mcisaac/getty", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:32:19.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8830f411088b8952045d3a74569ffd330227b551", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxxQbOF6qH5Z0Sty9bpNFsvcHTbq_wpkUDYeHEhyAcUVzPYf5NpS1UmtqIjf.fJvQQJVg9CQJyDMiUdAktuQaJLw--", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://nytimes.com/timeswire/feeds/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NYT > Most Recent Headlines", "title": "A Providence Chef Has Connections at the Docks", "title_full": "A Providence Chef Has Connections at the Docks", "published": "2017-10-03T23:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/04/dining/04REST-slide-NPJN/04REST-slide-NPJN-facebookJumbo.jpg", "performance_score": 7, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 730, "comments": 0, "shares": 730}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 19}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8830f411088b8952045d3a74569ffd330227b551", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxxQbOF6qH5Z0Sty9bpNFsvcHTbq_wpkUDYeHEhyAcUVzPYf5NpS1UmtqIjf.fJvQQJVg9CQJyDMiUdAktuQaJLw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PETE WELLS", "published": "2017-10-03T23:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Providence Chef Has Connections at the Docks", "text": "Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Continue reading the main story Slide Show Slide Show | 13 Photos Oberlin Oberlin Credit An Rong Xu for The New York Times\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 Raw bluefish was on the menu at Oberlin in July, and I was thinking: I hope they know what they\u2019re doing. Bluefish goes off so quickly that there was a chance my first impression would end my curiosity about this restaurant.\nBut I gave it a shot, and it was great: sliced cold and neatly fanned out like sashimi, then sprinkled with olive oil and salt and pickled garlic-chive buds, the bluefish was chewy and soft at the same time, somehow, and had a rich, oily flavor that was especially delicious because I knew that in 24 hours it would taste half as good and a day after that it wouldn\u2019t be worth eating at all.\nFinding bluefish fresh enough to serve raw takes connections down at the waterfront. Oberlin\u2019s chef, Benjamin Sukle, has been cultivating relationships with fishing captains in southern Rhode Island for about four years since he opened Birch , his small tasting-counter restaurant in this city\u2019s compact downtown.\nHis shopping list got longer when he opened Oberlin a few blocks away early last year. Fish isn\u2019t the only thing on the menu here, but there is a lot of it, and the ways Mr. Sukle uses it illustrate the exploration of local ingredients that makes Oberlin the most rewarding new restaurant I know of in Southern New England.\n The menu starts with a long list of raw seafood that is a snapshot of what\u2019s swimming around Rhode Island at the moment. \u201cWhen I go to the docks I\u2019m not just picking the best of the catch,\u201d Mr. Sukle said. \u201cIt\u2019s all great.\u201d\n I last ate there in the middle of September, when the raw fish included bonito and bigeye tuna, striped bass, mahi-mahi, both Spanish and Boston mackerel, and scup. A week or so later, the final gasps of a hurricane had chased the fish away, and Oberlin\u2019s raw bar was down to a dish dreamed up in the last hurricane season, mussels marinated in their steaming juices and a slug of aioli. Slightly rich and spicy under crunchy little sweet-potato chips, it is a terrific thing to eat even with plenty of fish around.\nBuying whole fish instead of fillets helps Mr. Sukle, who owns the restaurant with his wife, Heidi, keep prices down and the menu varied. I loved Oberlin\u2019s shiny, alluringly pasty brandade, made not with cod but with salted remnants of more abundant white-fleshed fish such as scup, mahi-mahi and fluke. It is served with a green splash of herbed olive oil on top and lightly toasted slices of the restaurant\u2019s excellent sourdough on the side.\nSalty pink hunks of cured bigeye tasted like the canned tuna of my dreams, alongside cucumbers and explosively ripe heirloom tomatoes seasoned with basil, wild mint and seaweed.\nCured local bluefish stands in for imported anchovies in a bracingly original interpretation of puttanesca sauce in which the flavor of each ingredient \u2014 garlic and tomato and chiles and bluefish and razor-thin shavings of green olives \u2014 was clear and distinct.\nBirch is the smaller, tidier and quieter of Mr. Sukle\u2019s restaurants. Lamb pelts thrown over the backs of high leather-upholstered seats project a studied cool borrowed from Scandinavia. The handmade ceramics are plated with more delicate precision. Greater subtlety is drawn out of, or spirited into, the ingredients.\nThere were delicious surprises in everything I tasted, and the set price of $55 for four painstaking courses was remarkably fair. When I ate there, charred cucumbers dressed with pistachio butter lurked below a translucent shingling of marinated cucumber. Airy fronds of fennel and a single preserved beach-rose petal had been airlifted into place on top.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy Opt out or contact us anytime Wild foods like beach roses turn up in both restaurants, a sign of the imprint left by Mr. Sukle\u2019s brief stint at Noma , in Copenhagen. Some chefs have copied Noma in exactly the wrong way, importing ingredients that grow in Denmark instead of scouring their own landscapes. I wonder if Noma\u2019s chef, Ren \u00e9 Redzepi , ever feels like the character in \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Life of Brian\u201d who tells a crowd of followers, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to think for yourselves! You\u2019re all individuals!\u201d only to hear them shout back in unison, \u201cYes! We\u2019re all individuals!\u201d\nMr. Sukle took Mr. Redzepi\u2019s teachings the right way. Edible discoveries get slightly more play at Birch, but the next time I\u2019m set loose in Providence for a night, odds are my feet will carry me to Oberlin. I like the friendly spontaneity of the dining-room crew. They\u2019re busier and can be harder to flag down than the staff at Birch, but once you have their attention they seem more engaged.\n Seating is in a rhythmic hodgepodge: high tables and bar stools to the right, regular tables to the left and out on the sidewalk, and a few wooden stools at the short counter facing the cooks who put together salads and slice raw fish under a sign that reads, \u201cTime flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana.\u201d (An absurdist streak is one of Providence\u2019s underappreciated charms.)\nI might settle in with sake \u2014 a diverse set of 10 are poured by the glass \u2014 or beer from such nonconformist breweries as To O l in Copenhagen and Prairie Artisan Ales in Tulsa, Okla. If I was feeling lucky I might roll the dice on the wine list, which contains some reliably crafted natural wines alongside some lean, withholding ones. An Oregon pinot noir recommended as a staff favorite was, to me, off-puttingly thin and tart.\nThen I would get down to business, starting with raw fish, of course. A submerged Italian theme surfaces on the menu from time to time. My experience with Oberlin\u2019s handmade pastas, though, was patchy. The filled pastas I ordered were not very good; both the duck inside triangular pansotti and the pork folded into doughy ravioli were dry and a little severe. But then there was that inspired puttanesca tossed with fusilli, and some wonderful potato gnocchi that were browned on one side and stirred into a buttery clam broth with tender littlenecks.\nKnowing that Mr. Sukle seeks out produce I\u2019m not likely to meet every day, I\u2019d keep an eye out for things like Victor squash. This is also known as Red Warty Thing , an accurate description in the fall when it ripens, but Mr. Sukle is fond of it when it is still green and immature. Cut into thin raw crescents that were sandwiched with juicy slices of cantaloupe and sprinkled with fresh oregano and za\u2019atar, then arranged over creamed feta, it tasted like a cucumber that has been carbo-loading. Its thin, edible skin was also delightfully free of large warts. (The Red Warty Thing lobby should feel free to use that language in its ad copy.)\nMost nights see two whole, bone-in fish on the menu, one grilled and the other roasted. I\u2019ve had yellowtail flounder and Boston mackerel, and both were cooked just the way they should be, with a hint of pink along the spine.\nThe same two desserts were offered each time I went. One was a rustic blueberry tart that was slightly underbaked on a first encounter and perfect the second time around. The other was a peach-blossom custard topped with fresh fruit. The custard had the fluffiness of a soft meringue. It was, in fact, a panna cotta infused with flowers that were preserved just like the rose petals and then frothed with a nitrous oxide canister. It was studiously put together but easy to like, which come to think of it is not a bad description of Oberlin itself.\nFollow NYT Food on Facebook , Instagram , Twitter and Pinterest .

If you like a sampler \u2014 a dash of modern, a sprinkle of ballet \u2014 the festival has you covered. And the price is right: Tickets are just $15.\nThis season, four programs remain. Think of each as a treasure chest, full of dance jewels; of course, certain ones have that extra sparkle. Here are the dances our critics are looking forward to on each program.\nProgram B: Petronio\u2019s Bloodlines: Yvonne Rainer and Steve Paxton Photo Nicholas Sciscione of the Stephen Petronio Company performing in Steve Paxton\u2019s \u201cExcerpt From Goldberg Variations\u201d at the Joyce Theater in March. Credit Andrea Mohin/The New York Times Yvonne Rainer and Steve Paxton are two original members of the Judson Dance Theater, the loose group of artists who radically rethought how to make and watch art in the 1960s. As Ms. Rainer wrote in her famous 1965 manifesto : \u201cNo to spectacle. No to virtuosity. No to transformations and magic and make believe.\u201d (And that\u2019s just for starters.) But inevitably pieces by Ms. Rainer, 82, and Mr. Paxton, 78, have become spectacle, as their work acquires the patina of historical importance, and their ideas continue to influence choreographers several generations down the line.\nProgram B (Wednesday and Thursday) offers a major treat, with Ms. Rainer\u2019s \u201cChair-Pillow\u201d (1969) and Mr. Paxton\u2019s solo \u201cExcerpt From Goldberg Variations\u201d (1986), performed by the Stephen Petronio Company as part of its Bloodlines project, which revives seminal contemporary dance works.\n In \u201cChair-Pillow,\u201d the dancers enact a simple sequence of sitting, standing and gesturing (set, rather whimsically, to Ike and Tina Turner\u2019s \u201cRiver Deep, Mountain High\u201d), which exemplifies Ms. Rainer\u2019s interest in ordinary movement , repetition and a neutral, nonperformative manner. \u201cExcerpt From Goldberg Variations\u201d offers an idea of Mr. Paxton\u2019s own improvisatory brilliance as a dancer (he is regarded as the originator of contact improvisation technique), his ability to contrast tiny physical impulses with thrilling dynamism and virtuosic musicality. Here is dance history percolating into the present. ROSLYN SULCAS\n Program C: Ailey Company in Ronald K.

Credit Andrea Mohin/The New York Times Before City Center was home to Fall for Dance, it was a home to Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, which first performed there in 1971 and is now in residence for five weeks every winter. So when the company takes the stage in Ronald K. Brown\u2019s jubilant \u201cOpen Door\u201d on Program C (Friday and Saturday), it will be on familiar terrain.\nThe dancers will also be at home in the pulse of Mr. Brown\u2019s voluptuous movement, a silken blend of modern, West African and Afro-Caribbean dance. \u201cOpen Door,\u201d from 2015, was his sixth Ailey creation \u2014 he first worked with the company in 1999 \u2014 and the depth of that relationship shows in how the dancers seem to relish every step.\nSet to recordings by Arturo O\u2019Farrill and the Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, \u201cOpen Door\u201d adds Latin social dances into the choreographic mix, setting hips swiveling, skirts rustling and couples flirting on a stage splashed with color by Keiko Voltaire\u2019s costumes. It\u2019s an unabashedly feel-good work, yet at a time when the Caribbean \u2014 the source of so many of Mr. Brown\u2019s influences \u2014 is struggling in the wake of recent hurricanes, its resonance may be more poignant and its outpouring of energy more urgent. SIOBHAN BURKE\nProgram D: Sara Mearns Collaboration Photo Sara Mearns and Honji Wang. Credit Christopher Duggan Fall for Dance premieres, like all premieres, are risky. But Sara Mearns thrives on risk. As a star of New York City Ballet, she is ever bold, always go-for-broke. And recently that daring has extended to experiments outside of her classical-ballet comfort zone \u2014 performing a solo by the anti-ballet modern-dance pioneer Isadora Duncan, seeking out the contemporary choreographer Jodi Melnick . These risks have paid off artistically.\nHer latest collaboration sounds particularly perilous: a duet with a hip-hop dancer. But that dancer, Honji Wang , a German of Korean heritage, is as spirited as Ms. Mearns, and accustomed to holding her own with star dancers from other disciplines: the kathak-meets-contemporary of Akram Khan, the iconoclastic flamenco of Roc\u00edo Molina.\nMostly, Ms. Wang works with her partner, the French-born hip-hop choreographer S\u00e9bastien Ramirez. He has helped choreograph \u201cNo. 1,\u201d the premiere for Ms. Wang and Ms. Mearns on Program D (Oct. 11-12). Shown as a work in progress at the Jacob\u2019s Pillow Dance Festival over the summer, it\u2019s an intense encounter between two women who communicate through different physical languages. Ms. Mearns is dressed in a tutu and toe shoes, but the experience is unlikely to be ballet business as usual.

When David Hallberg, the American Ballet Theater principal, first hurt his ankle \u2014 an injury that kept him out of ballet for two and a half years \u2014 he attended a performance by the Mark Morris Dance Group at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and everything about Mr. Morris\u2019s artistry became clear to him. \u201cFor some reason, I got it,\u201d Mr. Hallberg said during a rehearsal the other day. \u201cHis craft and his musicality. I remember sitting in my chair at BAM going, oh my God.\u201d\nMr. Hallberg brought up the possibility of asking Mr. Morris to create a solo for him to Stanford Makishi, City Center\u2019s vice president for programming. To Mr. Hallberg\u2019s shock, Mr. Morris agreed.

Working successfully from home doesn\u2019t take special apps, websites and arbitrary techniques; rather, it requires the same self-discipline necessary in any professional environment to accomplish tasks in a way that works best for you. We have worked out of our home offices for the last five years, often against the backdrop of cable news programming and running washing machines while consuming multiple homemade cafe lattes all from our standing desks \u2014 and often in comfy clothing. As is the case with millions of self-employed Americans, the main priority driving us is the work itself \u2014 ensuring that our clients get the materials they require, completing projects on time and meeting benchmarks for our small business. Being successful at working from home doesn\u2019t require a magic checklist of dos and don\u2019ts, but instead a focused desire to perform and succeed. As more of us continue to leave the confines of an outdated brick-and-mortar office in exchange for a more balanced style of work-life integration, let\u2019s not create superfluous requirements imposing more stress and less productivity.

In the Ramayana, a central epic of Hinduism, Lord Rama crosses a bridge from here to rescue his wife, Sita, from the demon king Ravana in Sri Lanka. Credit Atul Loke for The New York Times DHANUSHKODI, India \u2014 At dawn, a procession of buses sped past coconut huts, past fishermen unfurling nets and through the ghost town of Dhanushkodi \u2014 leveled in a powerful hurricane in 1964 \u2014 before stopping at a stretch of beach where, according to Hindu mythology, an ancient bridge once stood.\nAs day broke, barrel-chested businessmen filed into the ocean, reciting mantras. Hindu priests, clad in white, dropped to their knees to lead funereal ceremonies for families who had lost an uncle, a father. A cluster of teenagers wandered over the dunes.\nFor centuries, pilgrims from the Indian cities of Chennai, Mumbai and Patna, and a few from London, have traveled to the tip of a thumbnail island in southern India. It is here that the Ramayana , a central epic for Hindus, says Lord Rama crossed a bridge called Rama Setu to rescue his wife Sita from the demon king Ravana in modern Sri Lanka, a contemporary distance of about 20 miles.\nThe trip to Dhanushkodi is a bit easier for pilgrims today. They no longer have to walk or go by four-wheel-drive vehicles to the site. There is now a blacktop road with reflectors and a direct train line connecting pilgrimage sites in northern India to Rameswaram, a port town near Dhanushkodi. The line, inaugurated this summer with a speech by Prime Minister Narendra Modi near its terminus, covers about 1,700 miles.\n Photo Gandamadana Parvatham, also known as Rama Foot because it is said to bear the imprint of Rama, in Rameswaram, a port town near Dhanushkodi. Credit Atul Loke for The New York Times The improved access has brought in waves of tourists, and practically every family living here has cashed in. Spartan accommodation in ashrams has made way for a Hyatt hotel and tour groups of as many as 1,200 people. The government seems to have caught on as well, erecting block-lettered signs announcing the history of many more local sites of interest: the place where Sita quenched her thirst, the spot where Rama bathed.\n Recently, a team of researchers announced their intention to conduct an underwater exploration of Rama Setu, to determine once and for all whether the formations clearly visible on the ocean floor are naturally occurring sandbanks or structures made by humans. Alok Tripathi, an archaeologist who drafted the proposal, told the Indian news media he was \u201c100 percent sure we will find archaeological remains.\u201d\n Many of those pushing to explore the site have stopped short of saying they hope to find Rama Setu. But some historians warn that politicians have deliberately played down hard scientific evidence for the soft power gained by developing pilgrimage sites. As far-right Hindu leaders gain traction in India, some see Rama Setu as a case study in ideological excavation.\n Photo The Pamban Bridge, which connects Rameswaram to mainland India. Credit Atul Loke for The New York Times \u201cIf you\u2019re claiming that there was a bridge, go and excavate it, get the scientific data, put it through scientific analysis and see what it is,\u201d said Romila Thapar, an Indian historian. \u201cBut don\u2019t just say something was there.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cLet\u2019s face it, the pilgrimage places have a dual role. They always have a role for religion and for commerce.\u201d\nSome 2,000 years ago (the date is the subject of debate), the sage Valmiki wrote a highly regarded version of the Ramayana, a reflection on Rama\u2019s life, as a poem. But multiple renditions of the narrative exist in Buddhism, Jainism and across Southeast Asia. Details of Rama\u2019s rescue mission vary, depending on which source is consulted.\nMeenakshi Jain, the author of a book examining the story of Rama , said many ordinary Indians viewed Hindu epics as itihas, or a record of history. She said it was important for scholars \u201cnot to belittle or ridicule\u201d different streams of belief.\n\u201cThe epics may or may not have a historical kernel,\u201d she said. \u201cRational minds can distinguish what is a historical fact and what may not be. But they are conscious that myths convey a message that we should try to grasp.\u201d\n Photo The Ramanathaswamy temple in Rameswaram is one of the most important pilgrimage sites for followers of Hinduism. Credit Atul Loke for The New York Times Occasionally, Rama Setu has figured in rousing discussions on the floors of India\u2019s Parliament.\nWhen plans were proposed to break apart the marine formation to build a shipping canal in 2007, politicians \u2014 many from the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which is now in power \u2014 organized protests . The Archaeological Survey of India filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court claiming that no evidence existed proving that the bridge had been constructed by people. After a bit of push and pull, the project was halted.\n A trip to the site takes visitors through ruins of another kind. After the cyclone tore through Dhanushkodi, killing nearly the entire population, little was rebuilt. There is the skeleton of a church, sinking in the sand, and the remains of a railway station. Some claim the bridge, too, was uprooted from the seafloor by the storm.\n Photo A tourist shop in Rameswaram. Credit Atul Loke for The New York Times At the edge of the beach on a cloudy morning, not much was visible apart from distant patches of land belonging to Sri Lanka. A group of sinewy fishermen ripping shells from a net said they had no idea what was submerged in their fishing grounds. When they venture out in dinghies to catch tuna under moonlight, the water is impossibly dark, they said.\nBut the lack of a clear visual did not deter residents and pilgrims from describing, sometimes in elaborate, contradictory detail, what the bridge looks like.\nFirst, there is the question of its size. Estimates of the number of stones used in its primeval construction ranged from 1,000 to 20,000. Grilling fish on the side of the road, Kumar Kali, 36, methodically broke down the math for his own dubious calculation: if three feet of bridge contained about 50 stones, he supposed, the total number beneath the water should fall close to 3,000.\n Photo A cyclone tore through Dhanushkodi in 1964, killing nearly the entire population. Only ruins remain. Credit Atul Loke for The New York Times Nearby, in Rameswaram, Vinay Nair, 34, an engineer visiting from Bangalore, breathlessly explained how the sandbanks outlined the shape of Rama Setu. Ravi Chandran, 50, a temple employee, cited a NASA satellite image , which locals sporadically attribute to American scientists in Chicago.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d he said, referring to the bridge. \u201cI won\u2019t lie. But there is a huge picture of Rama Setu outside the ashram. All of us have seen that one.\u201d\nIn fact, the image pops up everywhere: in glossy tourist brochures; at hotels; in Hanuman\u2019s Temple, where a water tank holds \u201cfloating stones\u201d marketed as the same type that Rama\u2019s army of monkeys flung into the ocean to assemble the bridge.\nAs children peered wide-eyed into the tank, Kandan, 31, a caretaker who goes by one name, related a story he had heard in which the machinery used to dig up the actual stones crumbled into pieces. \u201cRama\u2019s bridge,\u201d he said, \u201cIndia cannot touch it.\u201d\n Photo Fishermen at Dhanushkodi beach. Credit Atul Loke for The New York Times Surveying the scene, Rama Moti, 64, a restaurant owner, lifted from his chair a bit at the mention of the stones. \u201cFakes,\u201d he called them, explained by natural processes and part of a campaign to commercialize Rameswaram.\n \u201cThe wind, it gets in them,\u201d he said of why the stones float. \u201cIt\u2019s the scientific way.\u201d\nBack along the water, Omkar Ashram, a sadhu, or Hindu holy man, who guessed his age at 70, said he was shocked by the pace of change in Rameswaram, which he last visited 20 years ago.\n\u201cSee, before, homes were huts,\u201d he said. \u201cStepping down from the train, only horse-drawn carriages were coming.

Government forces attacked the camp after militants seized it. Credit Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images SRINAGAR, Kashmir \u2014 On Tuesday, the sound of explosions woke Srinagar up.\nAt 4:30 a.m., residents heard the dull thud of grenades and the rapid bam-bam-bam hammering of machine-gun fire.\nSrinagar is the biggest city in the Indian-controlled zone of disputed Kashmir , and Kashmiris are sadly familiar with the sounds of war. But this was coming from an unusual place: the city\u2019s heavily fortified international airport.\nThree militants, who the Indian authorities said had slipped in from neighboring Pakistan, attacked a paramilitary camp near the airport, setting off a prolonged gun battle that lasted for hours and shut down the airport for the better part of the day.\nIt was the boldest strike in recent months, and though government troops eventually overpowered the militants and killed them all, the attack raised troubling questions about the airport\u2019s level of security.\n The Indian police said the attackers had cut a hole in the barbed-wire fence at a Border Security Force paramilitary camp that sits less than 1,000 feet from the terminal building of the airport, one of Kashmir\u2019s most vital hubs. It is ringed by hundreds of soldiers and police officers.\n \u201cWhile one attacker was killed in the initial gunfight, two others managed to sneak in,\u201d acknowledged Munir Khan, Kashmir\u2019s police chief.\nAt the sound of the first explosions, many residents of the nearby Humhama neighborhood took cover.\n\u201cWithin minutes I gathered my family in one room, till the first light came,\u201d said Syed Shujaat Bukhari, a Kashmiri newspaper editor who lives near the paramilitary camp.\nPhoto Indian soldiers at the scene of the attack. Credit Mukhtar Khan/Associated Press \u201cIt was frightening,\u201d Mr. Bukhari said.\nIndian commandos were rushed in and surrounded the building where the two surviving militants were holed up. As the firefight continued, loud explosions threw plumes of smoke and dust into the air.\nThe Indian forces struggled to kill the militants, and the firefight lasted nearly 10 hours. Police officials said it had taken so long because security officers were trying to be careful to avoid civilian casualties. There were several guests inside the paramilitary base at the time, and security services evacuated them before moving in on the militants.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

India responded with what it called a surgical strike against a militant camp inside the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir.\n\u201cThese kind of incidents will keep happening as long as Pakistan is our neighbor,\u201d Chief Khan said.\nIndia and Pakistan have been locked in a bitter dispute over the mountainous Kashmir region since the partition of what was then British India in 1947. An armed insurgency broke out in the early 1990s that has largely ebbed, but recently there has been a resurgence of protests after Indian forces killed a young and charismatic militant leader, Burhan Muzaffar Wani , in July last year.\nAt least 70 people were killed in those protests, and hundreds of civilians have been blinded by pellet guns as security forces cracked down on demonstrators in the aftermath of Mr. Wani\u2019s killing. Indian forces have detained hundred of activists as well.\nAfter the attack on Tuesday, the police said they were looking for seven more militants from the same group. The airport is managed by the Indian Air Force and also doubles as a military base with many attack helicopters based there.\n \u201cWhen they can strike near an air force base, they can strike anywhere,\u201d said Imran Ahmad Mir, a university student in the Humhama neighborhood. \u201cThe situation is going from bad to worse.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeffrey gettleman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sameer yasir @sameeryasir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burhan muzaffar wani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sameer yasir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "imran ahmad mir", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "indian air force", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jaish-e-muhammad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bold attack near airport rattles kashmir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kashmir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "humhama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "srinagar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhaka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:19:29.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "99845a69c68209b3239fd8224cdfa30f569ad428", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8BJ_iTY5.BKrnOSAWHaNnsnSRLS6oXDTN.HYxBxKE8x8rEchN48Z5vEWmFDkQeKZu3bkra2l1j54fQ3siQWPwvUrI8B63tPXcbn9vyJrJcMw--", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/dealbook/index.html", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "DealBook - The New York Times", "title": "E.U.

The decision, which will be announced on Wednesday, comes as European authorities consider a raft of proposals aimed at increasing the amount of tax paid by American technology companies. The regulatory push, combined with the prospect of tax reforms, have fueled accusations that the European Union is unfairly targeting the United States tech sector. E.U. officials have denied those claims.\nIt was not clear how much Luxembourg would be ordered to reclaim, according to the source, who did not want to be identified discussing information that was not yet public. Officials in Luxembourg and the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, declined to comment.\nThe ruling mirrors a similar order from the commission last year, directing Ireland to reclaim 13 billion euros , or $15.2 billion at current exchange rates, in back taxes from Apple.\n The actions have highlighted the heightened scrutiny faced by low-tax nations in the European Union. Those countries, critics argue, help multinationals funnel revenues from larger markets in order to lower their overall tax bill. Such behavior has infuriated larger countries like France, whose budgets have been squeezed in recent years.\n The investigation into Luxembourg\u2019s handling of Amazon was made public in 2014 , and the commission issued a preliminary finding the following year. In it, it described how the retailer used subsidiaries in Luxembourg to reduce its overall tax obligations.\nAt the time, the commission said that, in a deal struck in 2003, authorities in Luxembourg had conferred \u201can advantage on Amazon.\u201d The commission added that the \u201cadvantage is obtained every year and ongoing,\u201d and that it \u201cis also granted in a selective manner.\u201d\nAmazon does business across the 28-nation bloc, but lists its European headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country with a population of around 500,000. The agreement between Amazon and Luxembourg effectively capped the amount of tax Amazon paid, and relied on a method called transfer pricing, according to the commission.\nTransfer pricing has long been used by multinational companies to assign profits to different units, depending on factors like their role in the overall business and assets. But, according to the commission, these rules are harder to apply for technology companies, because their assets, like intellectual property, are intangible.\nEuropean regulators have claimed that Amazon sent most of its European revenue from one unit in Luxembourg to a separate subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax in the country. As a result, it was able to reduce the profit it generated from its European operations and cut its tax bill, the commission said.\n It is not illegal in the European Union for countries to try to lure businesses with low tax rates. But offering special deals to companies that are not available to their competitors can amount to what is known as illegal state aid.\nBoth Amazon and Luxembourg\u2019s finance ministry have previously denied that the online retail giant received special tax treatment or benefits.\nAmazon has already been in the commission\u2019s cross hairs this year for unfair competition.\nIn May, the company reached an agreement with Brussels over its e-books business after a two-year investigation. Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, had said certain clauses in Amazon\u2019s contracts may have made it more difficult for other e-book platforms to innovate and compete effectively with Amazon. The retailer said it would drop the clauses.\n And in January, Amazon agreed with Brussels to end an exclusive deal to supply Apple with audiobooks. Brussels said that step also was likely to improve competition in the bloc.\nThe cases against Amazon are among several in which the commission has targeted American technology companies. European Union officials are investigating Google and Qualcomm over possible abuses of their dominant market position, while regulators in various countries have investigated Facebook over its handling of customers\u2019 data.\nEfforts to curb multinationals from dodging tax have risen in prominence in recent months.\nLast month, the European Union began considering new proposals broadly aimed at tax internet companies in the countries where they generate their business, rather than allow them to shift profits to jurisdictions with lower rates.\nLuxembourg has been a particular target of increased scrutiny. In 2015, Ms. Vestager imposed an order on Luxembourg to claw back about \u20ac30 million from a Fiat Chrysler unit. A decision in a case considering Luxembourg\u2019s treatment of McDonald\u2019s is also still pending.\nThe prominence of Luxembourg has put Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, in an awkward position: his role includes oversight of the investigations yet his critics accuse him of having helped turn Luxembourg into a tax haven during his nearly two decades leading that country.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "e.u. said", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "european union", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "e.u.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "luxembourg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:30:16.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44f7e1586627e1f42d83312940a87cb9161d5f1c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8BJ_iTY5.BKrnOSAWHaNnsnSRLS6oXDTN.HYxBxKE8x65psa8vLOKTZhd3SBgSWE78ElREiT.dK7N3HVsHt_k5QRS1aSaujLE.UT3w.XWR8A--", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/dealbook/index.html", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "DealBook - The New York Times", "title": "Tax Cuts, Sold as Fuel for Growth, Widen Gap Between Rich and Poor", "title_full": "Tax Cuts, Sold as Fuel for Growth, Widen Gap Between Rich and Poor - The New York Times", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/03/business/04PORTER-01/04PORTER-01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "44f7e1586627e1f42d83312940a87cb9161d5f1c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8BJ_iTY5.BKrnOSAWHaNnsnSRLS6oXDTN.HYxBxKE8x65psa8vLOKTZhd3SBgSWE78ElREiT.dK7N3HVsHt_k5QRS1aSaujLE.UT3w.XWR8A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EDUARDO PORTER", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tax Cuts, Sold as Fuel for Growth, Widen Gap Between Rich and Poor", "text": " count=\"194\" data-total-count=\"194\">It is a little unsettling that the intellectual underpinning of tax policy in the United States today was jotted down on a napkin at the Two Continents Restaurant in Washington in December 1974. That was when, legend has it , Arthur Laffer, a young economist at the University of Chicago, deployed the sketch over dinner to convince Dick Cheney and Donald H. Rumsfeld, aides to President Gerald R. Ford, that raising tax rates would reduce tax revenue by hampering growth.\nIt was another economy. The top marginal income tax rate was 70 percent then. For three decades, just over 10 percent of the nation\u2019s income had gone to the 1 percent earning the most. Economists believed Simon Kuznets\u2019 proposition that though market forces would widen inequality at early stages of growth, further economic development would ultimately lead it to narrow. The paramount policy challenge of the day was how to raise productivity.\nTo many economists, Mr. Laffer\u2019s basic argument that high taxes would at some point discourage effort and reduce growth made sense: Why work or invest more if the government will keep almost all the fruits of your troubles? Even Arthur M. Okun, who had been President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s chief economic adviser, was writing about leaky buckets to illustrate a trade-off between efficiency and equity: Taxing the rich to pay for programs for the poor could slow growth down, in part by reducing the incentive of the rich to earn more.\n It is unclear whether reality ever followed Mr. Laffer\u2019s prescription. \u201cIn 1986 we dropped the top income tax rate from 50 to 28 percent and the corporate tax rate from 46 to 34 percent,\u201d said Bruce Bartlett, a policy adviser in the administration of President Ronald Reagan. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a bigger increase in incentives than that, and I can\u2019t remember any big boost to growth.\u201d\n Nonetheless, tax policy today is still being driven by his decades-old argument, devised in an economy that looks nothing like today\u2019s.\nToday, 1 percent of the population is taking in more than 20 percent of the nation\u2019s income, twice as much as when the fateful dinner took place. Today\u2019s top marginal tax rate, 39.6 percent, is a little over half what it was then.\nCritically, how the pie is sliced has become as important as how to raise productivity further. Indeed, the questions are intertwined. Compelling new economic research suggests that in the economy in which we live, cutting taxes on the rich further won\u2019t just fail to foster growth, it could even make the economic pie smaller.\nThe direct case against lower taxes on the rich was made most clearly a few years ago by the French economist Thomas Piketty \u2014 noted for his analysis of inequality trends over the centuries \u2014 and colleagues from the University of California, Berkeley, and Harvard University.\nLooking at a set of industrialized countries from the 1970s until the years preceding the financial crisis, the economists found no meaningful correlation between cuts in top tax rates and economic growth. Big tax cutters like the United States did not grow faster than countries like Denmark, which kept taxes high. What did respond to lower taxes was inequality: The income share of the top 1 percent grew much more sharply among big tax cutters like the United States than in countries like France or Germany, where top tax rates changed little.\nCutting Taxes The top marginal income tax rate has been cut sharply since the 1960s.\nHighest marginal income tax rate\n100\n%\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\nCURRENTLY\n39.6%\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\u201913\n\u201920\n\u201930\n\u201940\n\u201950\n\u201960\n\u201970\n\u201980\n\u201990\n\u201900\n\u201910\n\u201917\nHighest marginal income tax rate\n100\n%\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\nCURRENTLY\n39.6%\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\u201913\n\u201920\n\u201930\n\u201940\n\u201950\n\u201960\n\u201970\n\u201980\n\u201990\n\u201900\n\u201910\nOCT. 3, 2017\nBy The New York Times | Source: Tax Policy Center The findings contradicted the basic proposition on Mr. Laffer\u2019s napkin. Indeed, they suggested an entirely different dynamic: Lower taxes did encourage executives and other top earners to raise their incomes, but not in ways that benefited the entire economy, like working and investing more. Instead, they were encouraged to manipulate the system in ways that, in fact, reduced the pie for everybody else, putting every decision at the service of increasing their pay.\nThink about tax avoidance or outright evasion \u2014 which simply hides money from the Treasury, reducing the government\u2019s ability to fund often critical programs, at no gain to the economy. But executives have been known to use other tricks \u2014 say, options backdating or earnings manipulation , or simply lobbying the compensation committee of their company\u2019s board, or putting corporate strategy at the service of the current quarter\u2019s earnings to give the share price a bump.\n Taking into account all the ways top earners respond to taxation, Mr. Piketty and colleagues suggested that the optimal top tax rate on the Americans with the highest incomes \u2014 the rate raising the most money for the government \u2014 could exceed 80 percent with no harm to growth. Loopholes would have to be closed to prevent avoidance, but only the mega-rich would lose out. From an economic perspective, soaking the rich would, in fact, do good.\n The argument that inequality matters little and redistribution mars economic success has always been suspect. In more unequal societies, the disadvantaged will have less access to many of the things that improve productivity, like education, health and the internet. Rising inequality can hamper consumption by weighing on the income of the middle class .\nDouglas W. Elmendorf, former head of the Congressional Budget Office and now dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, once said that to assess the macroeconomic impact of cutting taxes and spending, it is indispensable to assess which taxes are cut and what spending is affected. \u201cMajor changes to benefits for lower-income people could have notable effects on the economy by altering labor supply, and those effects could be an important criterion in evaluating such changes,\u201d he argued.\nIn more unequal societies, the rich have more power to distort policy making to channel more of the fruits of growth in their direction by, say, cutting taxes and government spending that might improve productivity and growth. Politics becomes more polarized . And it becomes more difficult to recover from economic shocks: Citizens in unequal societies are less likely to buy government promises that sacrifice today will lead to gains tomorrow.\n\u201cWe have not paid enough attention to macro distributional linkages,\u201d said Jonathan D. Ostry, deputy head of research at the International Monetary Fund, who has published groundbreaking research linking inequality and growth. \u201cEven if you are only interested in the aggregate gains, you are forced to think about equity, because equity matters for the aggregate. The distribution might come back to bite you.\u201d\nMr. Laffer may still be calling to cut tax rates, to provide an incentive for executives to earn even more. But tax policy today calls for a new napkin, one with a place for equity.\nCorrection: October 3, 2017\nAn earlier version of this column rendered one word incorrectly in a quotation from Jonathan D. Ostry of the International Monetary Fund.

Sloan, on Tuesday faced blistering attacks from Republican and Democratic senators, who voiced frustration with his response to a series of scandals that have rocked the bank. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, accused Mr. Sloan of promoting an aggressive sales culture that led bankers to create millions of fake accounts. She called for his ouster.\n\u201cAt best you are incompetent, at worst you were complicit,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cEither way you should be fired.\u201d\nShe added that all Wells Fargo directors who served on the board during the years of the fake account scandal should be removed.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, also questioned whether Mr. Sloan had done enough to change the culture of Wells Fargo. Since the existence of fake accounts was revealed just over a year ago , other scandals have been uncovered, including instances in which auto insurance customers were charged excess fees and active duty service members had their cars seized.\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story \u201cThe changes Mr. Sloan and his team have made are not sufficient to reform a corporate culture that is willing to abuse its customers and employees in an effort to pad its numbers and increase executive compensation,\u201d Mr. Brown said.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

When the challenges at Wells Fargo demanded decisive action, the bank\u2019s leaders acted too slowly and too incrementally.

That is because we have spent the past year determined to earn back the public\u2019s trust.\u201d\nThe remarks did not satisfy the senators.\nSenator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, asked Mr. Sloan: \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name were you thinking?\u201d\nContinue reading the main story We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page.

The American soprano Angel Blue , in her company debut, sings Mim\u00ec until Oct. 27, and she was the clear star on Monday, combining power, as needed, with sensitivity and warmth. The Ukrainian tenor Dmytro Popov , who made his Met debut last year as Rodolfo, rises strongly to the role again here but sings it only through Oct. 9, giving way to two other tenors this fall and a third in the spring. The Romanian soprano Brigitta Kele, who also made her company debut last year, as Musetta, makes a vivid impression in that role, though her glittering voice tended to tighten at the top on Monday. For the rest, the ensemble was vocally strong and well matched: Lucas Meachem as Marcello; Duncan Rock, in his Met debut, as Schaunard; and David Soar as Colline. They were also appealing in their byplay, presumably guided by the revival stage director, Gregory Keller. The veteran bass Paul Plishka smoothly dispatched the roles of the stooges Benoit and Alcindoro. Also making his Met debut is the English conductor Alexander Soddy , who leads the fall performances. On Monday he showed good care for balances and nuance, and the stellar players seemed to respond well to him. If there was a little slippage among the teeming contingents in Act II and with singers deeply recessed onstage in Act III, that pretty much comes with the Zeffirellian territory. \nLa Boh\u00e8meThrough March 10, with different casts, at the Metropolitan Opera, Lincoln Center; 212-352-6000, metopera.org.

It should also be noted that Mr. Singh was born into one of the bluest of blue-blood families in India (he is 15th in line to the former throne of Kapurthala, he says). \u201cI know that I come from a privileged background and that the lottery of birth has been lucky for me,\u201d he said. Big Break In January, he opened Amar Gallery to showcase \u201ca broad model of wonderful art that has a message,\u201d he said. It took him more than two years to find the right space in Central London. \u201cMy God, we can\u2019t have every street corner filled with banks and multibillion-dollar coffee chains,\u201d he said. But it\u2019s his activist work on women\u2019s rights and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues that have received the most attention. After The Times of India published an article in 2009 quoting Mr. Singh, who was then 20, as supporting gay rights, he endured such intense blowback that he fled the country. \u201cI was receiving death threats for promoting equal rights, but it doesn\u2019t even compare to the harassment faced by activists who don\u2019t have the luxury to leave,\u201d he said. Latest Project \u201cBlack Exodus: Act I \u2014 Materia Prima,\u201d a solo show of black-and-gold works by the British-Liberian artist Lina Iris Viktor, is on view through Oct. 31 at Amar Gallery. The exhibition\u2019s sociopolitical subtext has unexpectedly taken on new meaning in light of the violence in Charlottesville, Va. \u201cIt is a very powerful show given this age of attacks against African-Americans,\u201d Mr. Singh said. Next Thing His exhibition featuring feminist pieces by Renee Cox and the Guerrilla Girls inspired by \u201cthe origin story of Adam and Eve from the female\u2019s perspective,\u201d opens in January of next year. Soldier of Love Mr. Singh\u2019s deep pockets and gallery sales help fund a grass-roots network of activists in India. \u201cI call it an army of love,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly last week I got a message from an individual who received threats from their own parents for coming out as gay. It\u2019s utter madness.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kanwar amarjit singh", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "adam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lina iris viktor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lauren fleishman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "renee cox", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "times of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times kanwar amarjit singh hometown london now lives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guerrilla girls", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kapurthala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "va.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlottesville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shoreditch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amar gallery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:32:10.000+03:00"}], "totalResults": 9219, "moreResultsAvailable": 9119, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=1eee5ef1-4d51-497e-9e88-ed86353bcda9&format=json&ts=1507055530000&q=language%3Aenglish+site%3Anytimes.com&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 766}
