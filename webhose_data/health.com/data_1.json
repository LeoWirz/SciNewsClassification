But research also suggests there are some quick and easy things you can do to feel better, at least temporarily and perhaps even long-term, says Stephen Schueller, PhD, assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University\u2019s Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies. If you\u2019ve got a free hour and you\u2019re looking for a pick-me-up, here\u2019s how he suggests you spend it.\nGet some exercise Exercise has been shown to boost the production of endorphins in the brain, and numerous studies indicate that the feel-good glow after a workout can last at least several hours. Now, a new study in the American Journal of Psychiatry suggests that getting as little as one hour of exercise a week may even help prevent some cases of depression from developing.\nThat study, which followed more than 22,000 Norwegian adults for an average of 11 years, found that people who reported getting no exercise at all were 44% more likely to develop depression over the course of the study, compared to those who got at least one hour a week.\nIn this study, protective effects were observed for exercise of all intensity levels, from casual walking to hard-core sweat-fests. But Schueller says that for short-term mood-boosting benefits, it\u2019s best to really get your heart pumping. \u201cIt definitely doesn\u2019t have to be a very long workout,\u201d he says. \u201cBut other research has shown that it does need to be somewhat intense \u2014more than just easy walking\u2014in order to get those immediate mental-health benefits.\u201d\nRELATED:  These Are the Best Exercises for Anxiety and Depression \nCatch up with an old friend Whether it\u2019s calling a childhood pal you haven\u2019t seen in a while or meeting up with your neighbor for a cup of coffee, spending an hour in meaningful conversation can have serious benefits for your mental health, says Schueller. Turning to a perpetually cheerful friend may even help you \u201ccatch\u201d his or her good mood , according to a recent study in Royal Society Open Science .\n\u201cSpending time with friends and family is something we don\u2019t do enough, and it has a lot to do with our happiness and wellbeing,\u201d says Schueller. For double the mood-boosting benefits, he suggests combining exercise and social interaction\u2014by inviting a buddy along for your regular walk or jog, for example.\nTo get mental health tips delivered to your inbox, sign up for the HEALTH newsletter \nWrite down (and reflect on) what you\u2019re grateful for Keeping a gratitude journal has been associated with both short-term mood improvements as well as a reduced risk of depression over time. Some experts recommend writing down three things a day you\u2019re grateful for, but Schueller says he prefer to take a more reflective approach to counting his blessings.\n\u201cI write down one thing every day that I\u2019m really grateful for, and at the end of the week I look back and think about the best thing that happened to me that week,\u201d he says. \u201cI do the same thing at the end of the month, and at the end of the year, and that\u2019s what keeps me going back to my journal and keeping everything in perspective.\u201d\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "schueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen schueller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "northwestern university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for behavioral intervention technologies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american journal of psychiatry", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:53:30.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e3621418ad646c97f1851678acc758c0829898f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjm7Pu91MJIjYgjA3UQAKgfrYYzRisfwfZrjkpnnh9NMC2a40RvxSfhVxGi.HCTGe1g--", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Tom Petty Died of Cardiac Arrest \u2014 What You Need to Know", "title_full": "Tom Petty Died of Cardiac Arrest \u2014 What You Need to Know", "published": "2017-10-03T17:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/tom-petty-3.jpg?crop=0px%2C64px%2C2000px%2C1051px&amp;resize=1200%2C630", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e3621418ad646c97f1851678acc758c0829898f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjm7Pu91MJIjYgjA3UQAKgfrYYzRisfwfZrjkpnnh9NMC2a40RvxSfhVxGi.HCTGe1g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarah Klein", "published": "2017-10-03T17:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tom Petty Died of Cardiac Arrest \u2014 What You Need to Know", "text": "Email \nTom Petty died Monday at age 66 in Los Angeles after entering cardiac arrest. \u201cHe suffered cardiac arrest at his home in Malibu in the early hours of this morning and was taken to UCLA Medical Center but could not be revived. He died peacefully at 8:40p.m. PT surrounded by family, his bandmates, and friends,\u201d Petty\u2019s manager said in a statement to PEOPLE . \nCardiac arrest falls under the umbrella of heart disease , which kills around 610,000 Americans every year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But unlike other forms of heart trouble, cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without notice. \nCardiac arrest is caused by an electrical malfunction in the heart that stops the heart from beating. This can be caused by an irregular heartbeat (called an arrhythmia), a heart attack, or coronary artery disease . No matter the cause, when the heart stops beating, blood is no longer pumped through the body, which leads to loss of consciousness. \nRELATED: What Is Cardiac Arrest \u2013 and How Is It Different From a Heart Attack? \n\nThe same factors that put someone at risk for heart disease increase her chances of cardiac arrest. That includes having high blood pressure , high cholesterol , or a family history of cardiac arrest and other forms of heart disease. \nWithout immediate treatment, cardiac arrest is often fatal. About 350,000 cardiac arrests happen each year outside of a hospital setting, and 90% of those people die from the event. \nBut with emergency medical attention, cardiac arrest can be reversed. When used within a few minutes, a defibrillator can shock the heart back into a normal rhythm. And now, portable defibrillators, or AEDs , are available in many public spaces (like sports arenas, gyms, malls, and restaurants) for bystanders to use. You just follow the instructions and voice prompts. \nHands-only CPR can also help someone in cardiac arrest until an emergency medical team arrives. To give someone in cardiac arrest hands-only CPR, press down firmly on the center of their chest at a rate of about 100 to 120 times per minute. \nThis article originally appeared on Health.com Show Full Article ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom petty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "petty", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ucla medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malibu", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T22:20:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a441d5c9f05e7bd793da379c431d2239ff4f2317", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjhGMEq8RYRG63zl0WphzDc5bMu.HNMutP7Qa4aLi11Dj3EPp7AhQEjI-", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "http://www.health.com/health/beauty-style/feed/", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Beauty - Health.com", "title": "4 Times Instagram Stars Proved Cellulite Is Totally Normal", "title_full": "4 Times Instagram Stars Proved Cellulite Is Totally Normal", "published": "2017-10-03T22:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium_16_9/public/styles/main/public/social-media-cellulite.jpg?itok=GR3H_IVq", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a441d5c9f05e7bd793da379c431d2239ff4f2317", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjhGMEq8RYRG63zl0WphzDc5bMu.HNMutP7Qa4aLi11Dj3EPp7AhQEjI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Health", "published": "2017-10-03T22:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "4 Times Instagram Stars Proved Cellulite Is Totally Normal", "text": "A post shared by A S H L E Y G R A H A M (@theashleygraham) on Sep 16, 2017 at 7:38am PDT \nGraham has been vocal about cellulite in the past, too, and we are here for her honest 'grams.

Here\u2019s What You Should Know", "text": "Email \nHugh Hefner\u2019s cause of death has been listed as cardiac arrest (which also killed Tom Petty just days later) and respiratory failure. But the week before he died on Sept. 27 at age 91, Hefner had an E. coli infection as well as septicemia, or bacteria in the blood, according to his death certificate, PEOPLE reported. \nE. coli , or Escherichia coli , bacteria live in our intestines normally, but certain strains can make us sick. Some cause diarrhea , urinary tract infections , pneumonia, and other illnesses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What makes Hefner\u2019s E. coli alarming, however, is that his death certificate listed it as resistant to antibiotics . Drug-resistant E. coli is particularly troubling because public health officials are running out of ways to treat such infections. \u201cThere are some infections that we see that are so resistant to antibiotics, we wouldn\u2019t predict that any antibiotic would be able to work,\u201d says Pritish K. Tosh, MD, a Mayo Clinic infectious disease physician and researcher. \nRelated Video: Fans Head To Playboy Mansion To Pay Respects To Late Hugh Hefner: \u201cHe Made It Ok To Be Yourself\u201d \nMost people with an E. coli infection in the gut, which would cause diarrhea, get better after a few days of rest and extra fluids to prevent dehydration. But more serious E. coli infections may require antibiotics and could be life-threatening, says Dr. Tosh, especially if first-line antibiotics are not effective. (Dr. Tosh did not treat Hefner.) When E. Coli doesn\u2019t respond to treatment, doctors might use older antibiotics, but those can be less effective and more toxic, he says. \nThink of antibiotic resistance as a survival mechanism for bacteria, Dr. Tosh explains. Bacteria developed resistance over time to drugs designed to kill them off so they could keep multiplying. But humans may be making it easier for these so-called superbugs to thrive\u2014in part by taking more antibiotics than we need and not using them as recommended by doctors. \u201cThe more antibiotics we use, the more pressure there is on bacteria to survive,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we aren\u2019t taking conscious steps, we will find ourselves back in the pre-antibiotic era.\u201d \nThankfully, cases of antibiotic-resistant E. coli infections are rare, says Dr. Tosh. The bacteria, which are usually spread through contaminated food, water, or from person to person, first set up shop in the gut. In most healthy people, good gut bacteria keep the bad ones in check. But if you\u2019re already sick or your immune system is compromised, taking antibiotics will reduce your levels of healthy gut bacteria and give drug-resistant bacteria a greater chance of surviving, thriving, and triggering serious illness, he explains. \nThe cause of Hefner\u2019s E. coli infection was listed on his death certificate as unknown, according to PEOPLE. He also had septicemia, or bacteria in his blood. \u201cSepsis is the body\u2019s overwhelming response to an infection that leads to organ shut-down,\u201d Dr. Tosh explains. It\u2019s a sign that bacteria infecting another part of the body have infiltrated the bloodstream and provoked a serious, life-threatening reaction. \nWhile antibiotic-resistant infections of any kind pose a looming public health threat, there are two simple things you can do to help on an individual level: Get your vaccines (so you don\u2019t become sick in the first place and badger your doctor to give you antibiotics you don\u2019t need) and wash your hands on the regular, according to the CDC, which significantly reduces the spread of bacteria and other bugs. \nThis article originally appeared on Health.com Show Full Article ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hugh hefner", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "pritish k. tosh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom petty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tosh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hefner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah klein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "e. coli", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "drug-resistant e. coli infection", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T02:33:04.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2e6cda599f7f17da3d7a793288e95cc84bfd5689", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjm7Pu91MJIjYdvWPpHt71adEnLvJwAKb27hVmETaFs3pXKq3wU0h2tmPZQg7FsGe1L.9vC0FJ8Henk1JLYjBtUutHyWSZJwwuTY0MBVghi5bRn.zIvhT6tM-", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Americans' Health Woes May Have Swayed 2016 Presidential Election - Health", "title_full": "Americans' Health Woes May Have Swayed 2016 Presidential Election - Health", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.039, "main_image": "http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium_16_9/public/voting816.jpg?itok=xxjokJYK", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2e6cda599f7f17da3d7a793288e95cc84bfd5689", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjm7Pu91MJIjYdvWPpHt71adEnLvJwAKb27hVmETaFs3pXKq3wU0h2tmPZQg7FsGe1L.9vC0FJ8Henk1JLYjBtUutHyWSZJwwuTY0MBVghi5bRn.zIvhT6tM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "October", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Americans' Health Woes May Have Swayed 2016 Presidential Election - Health", "text": "Americans' Health Woes May Have Swayed 2016 Presidential Election Rural counties with fewer doctors and high teen birth rates shifted to Trump, study shows October 03, 2017 \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Americans struggling with health issues may have been more likely to vote Republican in the last presidential election than they were four years earlier, a new study indicates. \n\"Across the country, we found that voters in counties with poor public health shifted dramatically towards the Republican candidate in 2016, compared with 2012, an effect that was particularly strong in states where the results changed Electoral College votes,\" said study author Dr. Jason Wasfy, from the division of cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \n\"Although we cannot determine causality from these results, the findings raise the possibility of a role for public health status in determining voting behavior,\" Wasfy said in a hospital news release. \nPrevious studies have shown that poor mental and physical health, particularly among older people, keeps voters from casting their ballots in political elections. \nSurprising shifts among voters in several states in 2016, including Texas and Wisconsin, prompted researchers to examine the potential effect that public health may have had on voting patterns. \nThe research team from the hospital and Massachusetts Institute of Technology reviewed voter turnout and election results for more than 3,000 counties. That's about 95 percent of American counties. \nThis information was compared to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health information compiled by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Specifically, the researchers considered health issues, such as the prevalence of obesity and diabetes, lack of food, teen birth rates and death rates. \nThe study showed 88 percent of counties shifted towards Donald Trump in 2016 compared to Mitt Romney in 2012. The counties that shifted toward Trump tended to be rural, predominantly white, lower-income and in the West and Midwest. \nThe counties that leaned towards Trump had less violent crime but faced higher teen birth rates and age-adjusted death rates than other counties. These counties also had fewer primary care doctors per person and other health care resources than the voters who didn't favor Trump, the analysis showed.

Bella Gerard October 03, 2017 \nAt 76, legendary fashion designer Vivienne Westwood is as lively as ever, and her gorgeous skin turned heads at Paris Fashion Week last weekend. \nThe only thing more surprising than her youthful glow? The secret behind it. \n\"Don't wash too much,\" Westwood said, in response to reporters' questions about her healthy skin secret, according to the New York Daily News . Her husband, Andreas Kronthaler, further explained his wife's washing routine. \nRELATED: How to Take a Better Shower \n\u201cShe only takes a bath every week. That\u2019s why she looks so radiant,\u201d Andreas Kronthaler told reporters. He also added that he himself bathes just once a month. \nWestwood has discussed her unusual cleansing habits in the past. \u201cI just wash my bits and rush out in the morning, and more often than not get in the bath after Andreas,\u201d she once told an interviewer from PETA . \nWeekly baths\u2014and worse, weekly baths in someone else\u2019s dirty water? We\u2019ve heard of weekly washing for hair, but surely the body must require a bit more attention. To find out, we asked a skin doctor if seven days without lathering up can really help achieve a glow like Westwood\u2019s\u2014and if waiting a week between baths is a smart skin strategy. \n\u201cI wouldn't recommend it,\u201d New York City\u2013based dermatologist Debra Jaliman, MD, told Health . \u201cIt doesn't seem healthy or hygienic, since it is important to cleanse the skin of bacteria and environmental pollutants.\u201d \nFor a better (and cleaner) approach to glowing skin, Dr. Jaliman has another idea. \u201cThe best way to maintain a youthful glow is by exfoliating,\u201d she explains. \u201cA buildup of dead skin cells can make your skin look dull, and exfoliating promotes cell re-growth, which will make your skin glow more.\u201d \nRELATED: The Best Skincare Products for Anti-Aging, Exfoliating, Moisturizing, and More \nFor a full-body exfoliation, we love the Original Coffee Scrub by Frank Body ($20, amazon.com ), a coffee-based vegan option which includes Vitamin E to help the anti-aging process and leave skin looking supple. To focus on the face, try the Daily ExfoliPowder by Amarte Beauty ($37, dermstore.com ). It's a gentle exfoliator that minimizes hyperpigmentation and achieves a bright complexion. \nWestwood's skin is gorgeous, but we think we'll stick to our daily showers and give these beauty options a try for now.

Tiffany Ayuda, Life by Daily Burn October 03, 2017 \nThis article originally appeared on DailyBurn.com. \nWork ran late, you hit rush hour traffic, and dinner took twice as long as expected. Once again, you watch your workout window shrink from an hour to\u2026mere minutes. But not all hope is lost. Thanks to this plyometric workout, 10 minutes is enough to get your heart rate up in no time. \nPlyometric exercises \u2014 which stretch and shorten your muscles through explosive movements \u2014 help build a trifecta of athleticism: speed, agility and endurance. That\u2019s why CeCe Marizu, a lead trainer for Daily Burn\u2019s new DB10 program , uses them when efficiency is key. \u201cPlyometrics are beneficial for strength and cardiovascular training, and for getting those fast-twitch muscle fibers to turn on.\u201d Marizu, a former D1 athlete, also relies on plyometric training to help track improvements in speed and endurance. \u201cI\u2019m always thinking can I get higher? Can I move faster while keeping my form?\u201d \nTRY IT NOW: Daily Burn\u2019s DB10 Program \nAnd your first challenge starts here. These bodyweight-only plyometric exercises will not only burn calories fast; they\u2019ll help improve your balance, quickness and mobility. Just remember to nail the fundamentals before adding height or speed, Marizu says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to mix up your workout. And who doesn\u2019t want to fly?\u201d Even better: No passports (or equipment!) necessary.

Do six reps of each move before continuing on to the next one at a constant and consistent pace. Take as little recovery time as possible \u2014 you\u2019ve only got 10 minutes, after all. If your body feels like giving up, remember that you can do more, even if it\u2019s just one more rep. \u201cWe can always test ourselves. That burning sensation is change,\u201d Marizu says. So hop, squat and jump to it! \nGIF: Daily Burn DB10 1. Quick Feet Side Burpees \nHow to: Stand with your feet shoulder-distance apart and your knees slightly bent.

And to complement these standard treatments, you can rely on specific  mental tricks , healthy habits, and relaxation tips. These might include keeping a journal, exercising on the regular, or meditating each day. Or you might turn to another specialist for extra support, like a massage therapist or a mindfulness instructor.\nBut maybe you've tried these traditional approaches to lifting your mood with no luck, or you've never felt like they were a good fit for you. If that's the case, the key to improving your mental well being might lie in one of these five innovative types of therapy.\nWalk and talk therapy Spending time in nature is a tried-and-true relaxation technique. Now, some therapists are taking this a step further by bringing their counseling sessions to the great outdoors. Whether it\u2019s called walking therapy, walk and talk therapy, or outdoor therapy, the idea is the same: a therapist and patient will go outside together, talking along the way just as they would inside an office\u2014but hopefully more freely. \nThe change of scenery alone might help people feel more comfortable, which can make therapy more effective. \u201cSometimes a different environment opens people up,\u201d says Chasse Bailey-Dorton, MD, medical director for cancer survivorship and integrative oncology at Carolinas HealthCare System\u2019s Levine Cancer Institute, where she works to support cancer patients and their families.\nRELATED: 17 Ways to Avoid Depression Relapse \nEven the act of walking itself can be meditative for some people. \u201cThere\u2019s a form of meditation called walking meditation, where you are very mindful and really focus on your steps, the movement of your feet, the process of walking. It can be great for anxiety and settling somebody down,\u201d adds Dr. Bailey-Dorton.\nTaking therapy on the go also means you\u2019re getting gentle exercise, and physical activity is a known mood-booster. \u201cRegularly, in my first or second session, I recommend to check with a family doctor about starting an exercise plan,\u201d says clinical health psychologist Gregory Rys, PhD, of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Exercise isn\u2019t a replacement for medication or therapy, he says. But walking, yoga , tai chai, and other activities are often helpful for people with anxiety and depression. \nArt therapy The term \u201cart therapy\u201d got a lot of buzz thanks to the adult coloring book craze \u2014but the practice isn\u2019t  as simple as shading between the lines. True art therapy is practiced under the guidance of an art therapist, and while it may involve colored pencils, markers, or clay, it goes deeper than coloring on your own.\n\u201cArt therapy is used to improve cognitive and sensorimotor functions, foster self-esteem and self-awareness, cultivate emotional resilience, promote insight, enhance social skills, reduce and resolve conflicts and distress, and advance societal and ecological change,\u201d according to the American Art Therapy Association . \nWhat conditions is it geared toward? \u201cWe find it helps a lot with anxiety, depression, and stress,\u201d says Dr. Bailey-Dorton. \u201cSometimes people don\u2019t feel comfortable talking or expressing their feelings, or they\u2019re not even sure of what their feelings are. Art therapy is a different way of expressing what you\u2019re feeling in a non-verbal way.\u201d\nShe has seen cancer patients work through depression and anxiety in group art therapy settings, where they created mosaics, designed scarves, and painted. \u201cEmotions come out in the paintings without necessarily putting a word to it, or as someone starts to describe what they\u2019ve done, they might realize what they\u2019re trying to express,\u201d she says. Not a fan of drawing or sculpting? Music or dance therapy have similar goals and can also be useful, says Dr. Bailey-Dorton.\nRELATED: 7 Types of Therapy That Can Help Depression \nCulinary art therapy Social worker Julie Ohana centers her practice around  culinary art therapy , where she \u201cuses cooking as the means of communication and expression,\u201d according to her website. The benefits range from stress management  to improved self-esteem\u2014along with some tasty results. While it\u2019s still a relatively new idea without a lot of research behind it, Dr. Bailey-Dorton believes that culinary art therapy gives patients and therapists a place to work through issues that doesn't have the sterile feel of an office. \nCulinary art therapy can also be an opportunity for a therapist to teach patients about nutritious eating, which can improve some depression symptoms, Rys says. Since depression can diminish your appetite and potentially lead to weight loss, spending time with a culinary art therapist might reignite your desire to cook and eat, he adds, while helping you get a handle on your mental health.\nLaughter therapy There\u2019s a reason laughter has a reputation as good medicine\u2014it really works. Laughing can lower blood pressure and reduce stress, and some research suggests it may even have the same calming  affect on the brain as meditation . Also called humor therapy, laughter therapy  includes exercises, movies, books, games, puzzles, and even visits from clowns, particularly in hospital settings, according to the National Cancer Institute. \u201cI\u2019ve been in laugh yoga sessions that guide folks through laughter exercises, and then you just see it spontaneously take off,\u201d Dr. Bailey-Dorton says. \u201cPeople feel more energized, relaxed, and happy afterward.\u201d\nLaughing with your therapist in a one-on-one setting is also effective, Rys says. \u201cIt creates a situation where the mood state is incompatible with the depression or anxiety that\u2019s presenting in the moment,\u201d he explains, which makes patients feel a bit better and possibly more receptive to therapy. \nTo get our top stories delivered to your inbox, sign up for the HEALTH newsletter \nHypnotherapy Hypnotherapy isn\u2019t hypnosis, so forget all those preconceived ideas about getting sleepy and letting someone else control your thoughts and actions. Instead, hypnotherapy  is about focusing your attention and then harnessing that focus to improve mental well being. While it does call for patients to go into a trance-like state, this makes you more open to learning \u201cpositive suggestions to help you overcome mood problems or problems of behavior,\u201d Rys says, with the help of a trained professional.\n\u201cHypnosis gives the impression that somebody else is doing something to you, which is dis-empowering.

Jenna Birch October 03, 2017 \nHave you gone for your yearly flu shot yet? We hope the answer is yes\u2014but statistically, it's probably no. That's because only two in five people report getting the vaccine annually, according to a 2016 CDC report . This is in spite of the fact that experts say it\u2019s one of the best health measures you can take each season and will keep you from experiencing the awfulness of flu symptoms like a high fever, chills, and bad cough . \nMaybe you're postponing it because you feel too overwhelmed right now with work. Or you're blowing it off completely because you're one of those people who insist they never get the flu anyway. Whatever your thinking is, give this list of reasons to get the vaccine a read\u2014it might help you see the wisdom in rolling up your sleeve. \nRELATED: 10 Biggest Myths About the Flu You'll cut your flu risk roughly in half \nTrue, the vaccine doesn't eliminate the possibility of contracting the flu, and how effective the shot is varies from season to season, says Laraine Washer, MD, hospital epidemiologist at University of Michigan Medical Center. But the vaccine used during the 2015-2016 flu season slashed the risk of getting it by roughly 50%, according to one study . And \"studies in healthy young adults show that flu vaccination decreases risk of influenza-like illness by 40% to 60% when the flu vaccine is well-matched to circulating viruses,\u201d Dr. Washer explains. You won't develop more serious flu-related issues \nWhile fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and a cough are the main symptoms of the flu, \u201csome patients have headaches or a sore throat , and vomiting or diarrhea can occur more often in children,\u201d says Dr. Washer. The real danger, however, is that a bout with the flu could lead to a much more alarming illness. \u201cThis includes pneumonia, or a serious complication of [an existing] chronic medical condition,\u201d says Lisa Kearns, MD, MS, clinical assistant professor of internal medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. \nRELATED: 25 Ways to Survive Cold and Flu Season Friends and family members will thank you \nThe vaccine isn't just about keeping you healthy. It also protects the people you know and love\u2014as well as coworkers, neighbors, and strangers you might casually interact with. \u201cThose most at risk include children, pregnant women or women who will be pregnant during flu season, anyone who has a compromised immune system, and people with asthma, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease,\u201d says Dr. Kearns. \u201cIn general, adults older than age 50 are considered higher risk, as well.\u201d But if you don't get the flu, then your grandmother, your best friend's new baby, your sister with asthma, and other members of vulnerable groups can't catch it from you. Your won't put your life in danger \nLots of people still think of influenza as extremely unpleasant but relatively harmless. However, the CDC estimates between 140,000 and 710,000 hospitalizations occur as the result of the virus on an annual basis. \u201cIn addition, from 12,000 to 56,000 deaths are associated with flu every year,\u201d says Dr. Washer. Fatalities are generally caused by \u201cpneumonia, dehydration, or worsening of other health problems,\u201d she explains. Even if you're pretty healthy, it's still possible to end up with a case that could leave you out of commission for weeks. You'll save money \nWhile your health is the most important factor, getting sick hits you in the pocketbook too. First, there's the copay you need to fork over to see your doctor; next comes the money you'll drop at the drugstore to treat your fever, aches, and cough with over the counter products that can ease your flu symptoms. Depending on where you live, you could end up an average of $100\u2014and that doesn't include what you lose if you've used up all your paid time off or your company doesn't compensate you on sick days. \nRELATED: Here's Where You Can Get a Free Flu Shot This Fall You'll be protected for months \n\u201cYou want to be sure to get the flu shot before influenza begins circulating in your community, so October is a good time to get your flu shot,\u201d says Dr. Washer. She also notes that the nasal spray flu vaccine should not be used this season. Dr. Washer says there are \u201cconcerns that it is not as effective as the flu shot.\u201d Now is the best time to get that jab. It's available almost everywhere \nYour doctor's office, the local urgent care clinic, your company or campus health center, the pharmacy down the block\u2014the flu vaccine is so widely available right now, it's almost impossible to claim that you don't have the time to drop into one of these venues and get inoculated. Not only is it easy to find, but getting the shot takes minutes, and you might even be able to score it for free .

The mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas , along with recent mass murders at concerts in Manchester and Paris as well as at Pulse nightclub in Orlando , have many people on high alert when they find themselves in large crowds. \nFeeling unsafe at a big gathering used to be more of an irrational fear, Chloe Carmichael, PhD, a psychologist in New York City, told Health . But unfortunately, mass killings by lone gunman and terrorist groups means this worry is no longer irrational. \u201cThe anxiety we feel at events like these is usually on a primal level,\u201d says Carmichael. \u201cIt\u2019s survival anxiety , and it triggers your fight or flight response.\u201d \nOne way to combat crowd anxiety is to have a friend with you, someone who will act as an ally if you get nervous. \u201cMake sure they know beforehand that you\u2019re feeling a little anxious and that you might need them to reassure you that you\u2019re safe,\u201d Carmichael suggests. You want a friend there who you can confide in and talk to about what you\u2019re feeling, she says, because \u201cif you\u2019re feeling bodily sensations of anxiety, putting those feelings into words gives us more of a sense of control over them.\u201d \nRELATED VIDEO: Dr. Deepak Chopra Shares His Tips for Managing Anxiety & Making a Personal Transformation \nAnother calming tactic you can use when you start to feel overwhelmed in a crowd is a breathing technique that helps you steadily inhale and exhale, which keeps your body and mind centered. It can help you slow down and bring awareness and control to your body. \u201cMaintaining your quality of breath is important,\u201d says Carmichael, who teaches her clients a specific three-part breathing technique here . \nIt\u2019s also helpful to remember that while concerts and other gathering places may pose a risk, we take risks every day by flying, driving, and doing tons of routine activities. \u201cOnce we decide that we\u2019re going to go ahead and take a risk like flying, it does no good to focus on it in the airplane,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can take a rational and logical approach, and once you\u2019ve decided to go to an event, put that fear on the shelf.\u201d \nIf worries do start to pop up and intensify, Carmichael advises reminding yourself why you chose to be at the show. \u201cYou might tell yourself, you already thought this through and made the choice to be here, and the best thing you can do right now is focus on having fun or doing what you came here to do .\u201d \nIf you find that crowd anxiety is keeping you from attending events you used to enjoy or other experiences, like commuting on mass transit or going to clubs and parties, it\u2019s a good idea to seek treatment from a professional, says Carmichael, who can help dial back your fears. \nBut don\u2019t forget, feeling anxiety after reading about and watching the news coverage of the Las Vegas shootings and other horrific events isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, she says. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s worth feeling anxiety and anger or other feelings that the world isn\u2019t safe; that can serve a purpose and stimulate us to want to be proactive in some way, whether it\u2019s volunteering for a cause, writing letters, whatever you feel is important,\u201d Carmichael says. \nTo channel that anxiety, Carmichael suggests following the CARE method. Consider how a world tragedy is making you feel as opposed to pushing those feelings away. Act by doing something that you think will ease those feelings, like developing a safety plan, prepping a go bag, or even just talking to a friend about it\u2014something that will demonstrate to yourself that you\u2019re addressing your anxiety in an appropriate way. Then, reflect on how that action made you feel. Next, ease into something else, giving yourself permission to move on from the tragedy. \nThe CARE method is a positive way to deal with the natural, totally normal worries that crop up when deadly, random attacks like this occur. \u201cSometimes that anxiety needs a healthy outlet,\u201d says Carmichael, \u201cso it\u2019s ok for [tragedy] to spur you to take action.\u201d \nThis article originally appeared on Health.com Show Full Article ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chloe carmichael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmichael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deepak chopra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "health", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T23:58:15.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5b9edf887007945f90e15e227dcc2640e44d347f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjgycM3sRgNfkp89WIxRrZkxTEkJplK7CJ8hotoyQC4EaG._p9ZULGQm39BkuARQuGD1SBTa9i0ib", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "http://www.health.com/depression/feed", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Depression - Health.com", "title": "9 Inspiring People Tackling Depression, Anxiety, and Mental Health Stigma on Instagram", "title_full": "9 Inspiring People Tackling Depression, Anxiety, and Mental Health Stigma on Instagram", "published": "2017-10-05T00:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5b9edf887007945f90e15e227dcc2640e44d347f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjgycM3sRgNfkp89WIxRrZkxTEkJplK7CJ8hotoyQC4EaG._p9ZULGQm39BkuARQuGD1SBTa9i0ib", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Health", "published": "2017-10-05T00:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "9 Inspiring People Tackling Depression, Anxiety, and Mental Health Stigma on Instagram", "text": "[brightcove:5597028796001 default]\nSocial media can be a double-edged sword when it comes to  mental health .

We asked experts to lay it out for us. Bella Gerard October 04, 2017 \nNicolette Fusco was one of the lucky few who had never struggled with acne, oily skin, or other skin problems that often plague teens and young adults . But three years ago when she was 22, her skin suddenly took an inexplicable turn, and she began to suffer from severe recurrent bouts with the skin condition eczema \u2014an umbrella term for various types of itchy, scaly red rashes that can flare up on any part of the body. \nEvery summer, the creases of Fusco's arms and legs would become bumpy, red, and dry, and sweat triggered by the hot weather would irritate and inflame the rashes. A visit to a dermatologist didn't turn up any reason for the eczema, but it didn't appear to have any connection to her weight; she carried about 185 pounds on her five-foot-one frame. \nRELATED: 13 Things That May Make Atopic Dermatitis Worse \n\u201cI was so uncomfortable in my own skin,\u201d recalls Fusco. \u201cI would have dead skin everywhere; it would fall off of my legs and it would burn.\u201d To deal with the eczema, she began covering her body in layers, no longer comfortable in shorts or other clothing that might expose the bumps to those around her. \nFusco\u2019s eczema would continue to plague her for two more years. But in fall 2016, she decided to address her weight. \u201cWith the help of Jenny Craig and daily exercise, I was able to lose over 45 pounds over several months,\u201d she says. While not overly restrictive, her diet did call for a major makeover in the way she approached food: no junk food, a heavy emphasis on vegetables, and major cutbacks on meat and alcohol. She also upped her water intake and practiced portion control. \nProud of her weight loss and with summer approaching, Fusco was eager to show off her new shape. Once she was back in body-revealing clothes, however, she realized that it wasn't just extra pounds she lost; her eczema had disappeared too. \nCould her dramatic weight loss or her healthier approach to eating put the brakes on a severe skin condition? According to the dermatologists we asked, it\u2019s very possible. \nRELATED: These Are the Best Moisturizers for Combination Skin \n\"Weight loss, generally speaking, may improve eczema,\u201d New Jersey\u2013based dermatologist Jeanine Downie, MD, tells Health . \u201cAdditionally, her regular exercise also decreased her stress level, which might have improved her eczema as well.\u201d \nSouthern California\u2013based dermatologist Ava Shamban, MD, agrees. \u201cEczema is an inflammatory condition of the skin, and treating the entire body with an anti-inflammatory approach does help it,\" Dr. Shamban explains to Health. By changing her diet to eliminate junk food and putting a new emphasis on vegetables and good portion control, [she] reduces systemic inflammation, there by helping eliminate her eczema.\u201d \nWhile Fusco\u2019s didn't change her diet with her eczema in mind, a change in eating is fairly standard suggestion for those struggling with the skin condition, according to nutritionist and registered dietitian Cynthia Sass, MPH, RD. \n\u201cIf you search for 'eczema diet' online you\u2019ll find a number of different protocols. But the standard approach is to begin with an elimination diet , which entails cutting out foods that may be triggering inflammation for at least four weeks, sometimes longer,\u201d explains Sass. \u201cA nutritious diet not only supports immunity and supplies nutrients involved in skin maintenance and healing, it also improves the health of your gut, which is critical for immune function.\u201d \nRELATED: How to Care for Your Sensitive Skin \nThe medical experts we spoke to seem to agree that the changes in Fusco's diet\u2014more so than the weight loss itself\u2014are likely what caused her eczema to subside. Either way, she\u2019s overjoyed with the results. \n\u201cI changed my diet to get healthier and lose the weight I had been struggling with, but the disappearance of my eczema has been a major added bonus,\u201d she says. \u201cAll the benefits that have come from making positive changes have kept me even more motivated to continue on my healthy journey.\u201d You May Like ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nicolette fusco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fusco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeanine downie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bella gerard october", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shamban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cynthia sass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ava shamban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenny craig", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T15:35:20.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db3eec789cb65f2f6654d6e49f4a06f463617790", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjoNAExksdLbIWuVnL.LMbRdmgXp7mQ7SE1LvwsGatbXxP6jF1EruPJVGY825SN4TN8qYPShpnu9i", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Lagom: 6 Ways to Adopt the Swedish Philosophy for a Balanced Life - Health", "title_full": "Lagom: 6 Ways to Adopt the Swedish Philosophy for a Balanced Life - Health", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.572, "main_image": "http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium_16_9/public/styles/main/public/gettyimages-532253301.jpg?itok=BVPO8Q70", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "db3eec789cb65f2f6654d6e49f4a06f463617790", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjoNAExksdLbIWuVnL.LMbRdmgXp7mQ7SE1LvwsGatbXxP6jF1EruPJVGY825SN4TN8qYPShpnu9i", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "October", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lagom: 6 Ways to Adopt the Swedish Philosophy for a Balanced Life - Health", "text": "6 Ways to Practice Lagom, the Swedish Secret to a Balanced, Happy Life This Scandanavian lifestyle trend is about to be everywhere. October 04, 2017 \nFourteen years ago, Nikki Brantmark was invited to spend her summer vacation with a friend on Sweden's West Coast. \"It was the perfect setting for the beginnings of a love affair\u2014not only with my Swedish husband but also with the Swedish way of life,\" she writes in her new book Lagom ($20, amazon.com ) . Pronounced LAH-gum, the term translates to \"not too little, not too much\" or \"just right\"\u2014and in Sweden it represents the art of living a balanced, slower, fuss-free life. \"Swedish people take their time. They stop, they look, they listen and they wait. The beauty of slowing down, I've learned, is that it helps you be more in the moment and enjoy the simple pleasures in life,\" Brantmark writes. \"And there's something very relaxing and satisfying about it, too.\" Below are six tips from her book, to help you add more lagom to your everyday life. Adopt the morgondopp \nBlessed with 11,500km (over 7,000 miles) of coastline and around 100,000 lakes, it\u2019s little wonder the Swedes love to bathe. But one type of alfresco bathing stands out: the morgondopp , or morning dip. Most commonly enjoyed between May and September (although some hardy types go year-round), the morgondopp is usually enjoyed first thing in the morning before coffee. The bather dons a dressing gown and wanders down to the local bathing deck. \nThe length of time you stay in the water depends on the temperature, which I\u2019ve noticed is something of a national obsession. Bathing piers wouldn\u2019t be complete without a small thermometer bobbing on the end of a string. Some people decide their bathing \u2018season\u2019 around these numbers. For example, my parents-in-law, Inger and Bo, begin their season when the mercury rises above 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F)! \u2018As soon as I hit the water, I feel completely awake and ready for the day ahead,\u2019 enthuses Inger. \u2018It\u2019s just you and the great expanse of water. \nIt\u2019s an incredibly humbling experience and so relaxing to feel the warm sun and cool breeze on your body afterwards.\u2019 \nNowhere near any sea, river, stream or lake? Try ending your daily shower with a cold-water blast. It may not be as mindful or empowering as a saltwater swim, but you\u2019ll still get many of the physiological benefi ts and will almost certainly wake up with a jolt! \nRELATED: 6 Ways to Practice Hygge, the Danish Secret to Happiness Dare to go alone \nMy Swedish friend Yvonne recounted how she\u2019d once gone on a solitary five-day hike across a nature reserve. Although she confessed that it\u2019s incredible just how many noises there are in the woods at night, the only time she was uncomfortable was when a party set up camp next to her and played the guitar until the small hours. Above all else, she enthused about how liberating and empowering the experience was. \nTo be honest with you, I can\u2019t quite see myself camping alone in the woods at night, but it does inspire me to head out for a few hours to feel the power of being alone in nature, and I hope it does the same for you. It\u2019s in these solitary moments that you appreciate the rustle of the leaves in the wind, the sound of the breaking waves or the distant melody of a lark. \nThe unbroken spell of nature allows you to slow down, switch off and be alone with your thoughts\u2014something of a rarity in the noisy world we live in today. \nRELATED: 50 Day Hikes You Must Add to Your Bucket List Create a capsule wardrobe \nLoosely speaking, the Swedish wardrobe could be likened to a capsule wardrobe\u2014a minimalist, highly practical closet created by clearing out unwanted or unused clothes and replacing them with a limited number of loved, highly versatile garments, which can ultimately be worn together. \nBecause a capsule wardrobe makes it easy to pick an outfit, you take the stress out of getting dressed and spend less time and energy on shopping and laundry. It\u2019s also more economical, and those who try it say it makes them feel happier. \nRELATED: What I Learned About Happiness After I Got Rid of Half My Wardrobe Take breaks \nThe Swedish fika paus is a break with a coffee and maybe a little treat. It could be an informal catch-up with a colleague prompted by a simple, \u2018Shall we have a coffee at 10? I\u2019d really like to hear about your holiday/weekend/nightmare neighbor.\u2019 Or it could be a more formal team fika , scheduled in the calendar months before. Formal or informal, it\u2019s about taking time to switch off for a few minutes and giving yourself a breather. \nSpeaking as someone who took some time to get used to this idea, you may feel a twinge of guilt at the self-indulgence. But actually, putting your feet up once in a while makes total personal and business sense. \nA study by Emily Hunter and Cindy Wu at Baylor University\u2019s Hankamer School of Business found that people who took morning breaks at work reported feeling more energized, more able to concentrate and more motivated, and were less likely to report symptoms like headaches and lower back pain. Interestingly, though, these positive effects fell the more time that elapsed between each break. In other words, taking short, regular breaks is key! \nTo get into the habit, try the 52\u201317-minute rule: A recent study found that the most productive people work for 52 minutes and then take a 17-minute break. Of course, not all jobs allow for this, but it\u2019s worth thinking about the frequency\u2014and keeping it in mind! \nNote to introverts : If the thought of making small talk can sometimes feel exhausting, there\u2019s nothing wrong with sloping off and indulging in some much-needed time alone\u2014whether it\u2019s taking a walk around the block, quietly sipping a coffee or doing whatever you need to do to feel rested. I learned this from the global HR director at my former company here in Sweden. He announced that, as an introvert, this was exactly how he was planning to spend his break, and that we should follow suit if desired. Music to every introvert\u2019s ears! \nRELATED: 15 Ways Being an Introvert Can Affect Your Health Learn the art of listening \nConverse with a Swede and you\u2019ll notice that they very rarely interrupt or talk over anyone else. Voices are kept to even tones (unless there\u2019s schnapps involved), and pauses in conversation are completely acceptable. To Brits, this can feel excruciatingly awkward. Culturally, we\u2019re so concerned about a gap in the conversation that we constantly overlap before people have completed their sentence. Swedes feel slightly awkward in these silent moments, too, but rather than desperately fill the gap with a hurried slew of off-the-cuff words, they\u2019ll make sounds, like a sharp intake of breath or even a sing-song sound like a two-toned \u2018hmmm\u2019. This gives them time to reflect on something meaningful that they can contribute. \nThis type of discourse doesn\u2019t work so well at a cocktail party where small talk abounds, but it will add more meaning to a full conversation. And like all things lagom, it\u2019s a fairer, more equal conversation where everyone gets a chance to say something, rather than just the loudest person in the room. \nThe next time you\u2019re in a social situation or enjoying a break at work, I challenge you to give it a go. Slow down the discourse. Really listen to others and reflect on what they have to say. Once someone\u2019s finished speaking, take time to reflect (if needed) before giving a meaningful response. Once you get into the slower rhythm, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s so much more relaxing to speak without fear of interruption. And you might just learn some new, fascinating things about the person you\u2019re speaking to! \nTo get more wellness tips delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Healthy Living newsletter Perform random acts of kindness \nAs with all things lagom, spreading a little happiness doesn\u2019t need to involve grand gestures. Sometimes the most ordinary acts add the most meaning and inspire the greatest smiles of all. \nWhen my second daughter was born, a Swedish friend turned up at the door with a family meal and insisted she wasn\u2019t staying, so as not to disturb. Another particularly busy friend of mine dropped in to make me a cup of tea when I injured my leg\u2014every day of the week! These simple, thoughtful acts lifted my spirits on the hardest of days. \nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re already a very caring person, but sometimes a gentle reminder to be aware of others doesn\u2019t go amiss. And often catching people off-guard with an unexpected act of kindness can be the most touching gesture of all. \nHere are a few simple ideas: \n1. Leave a kind note in a library book for the next reader. \n2. Decide to give out ten heartfelt compliments in a day. \n3. Write a thank-you note to the public services, like the police, firemen or nurses. \n4. Write a handwritten letter to a friend or relative you haven\u2019t been in touch with for years. \n5. Carry a spare umbrella and hand it over to a friend when it rains. \nExcerpted from Lagom by Nikki Brantmark. Published October 3 by Harper Design, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers.

People with diabetes don't have enough insulin to cover their bodies' basic needs for the hormone. \nThe researchers thought by mapping the genetic makeup of insulinoma tumors, they might come up with the genomic recipe for regenerating the beta cells that produce insulin. And if they could use that \"recipe\" to make a drug that would trigger the body to make insulin, they could treat -- or possibly even reverse -- diabetes. \nThe study's senior author, Dr. Andrew Stewart, said the researchers have mapped approximately 90 insulinoma tumors at this point, but only 38 were included in the current study. \n\"We have an actual wiring diagram in molecular terms for beta cell replication, and there are different mutation patterns that lead to beta cell regeneration. We've found about 30 different pathways,\" said Stewart. \nHe directs the Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \nStewart said it wasn't a complete surprise to see that there were multiple pathways, instead of just one or two. For example, he said, there isn't just one set of molecules that makes growth plates during childhood. \n\"We found many additional pathways... This is a data mine for diabetes researchers,\" he said. \nInsulin, which is made in the pancreas, is used to usher the sugar from foods into the body's cells to be used as energy. \nPeople with type 2 diabetes are resistant to the effects of insulin, and may not make enough insulin. About 29 million people in the United States have this type of diabetes, which is associated with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. \nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to mistakenly destroy insulin-producing beta cells. People with type 1 diabetes must replace that lost insulin through injections or an insulin pump. Approximately 1.25 million Americans have type 1 diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association. \nWith the information from this new study, the researchers hope to find or develop drugs that could work on one of those newly identified pathways. But it's important that the pathway doesn't have any other serious effects. \nStewart and his colleagues published a study in Nature Medicine in 2015 showing how the drug harmine could prompt beta cell regeneration in the lab and in mice. The pathway linked to harmine was one of the ones found in the current paper, too. \nBut \"harmine is a hallucinogen,\" Stewart said. \nSo, if taken as a pill or given as a shot, it would affect the whole body and produce unwanted side effects. \n\"We still need a way to deliver it specifically to the beta cells,\" said Stewart. \nThere's also a concern that a drug like an insulinoma could cause the body to produce too much insulin, leading to potentially dangerous side effects. \nAndrew Rakeman is assistant vice president of research for JDRF -- formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. \n\"You don't want to replicate the lack of control of an insulinoma. The question is can we find ways to switch these pathways on and then switch them off?\" said Rakeman, who wasn't involved in the new study. \nHe also pointed out that it's important that any drug just targets the beta cells and doesn't encourage cell growth in other areas. \nStewart said a therapy developed from these pathways would likely be for people with type 2 diabetes first. People with type 1 diabetes have the added issue of the autoimmune attack, which could destroy any newly made cells. \nFor people with type 1 diabetes, some sort of immune system suppression might be necessary, Stewart said. Rakeman said it's possible repeated treatments might keep enough beta cells alive to be effective, though that remains to be seen. \nFor now, Stewart and Rakeman said these findings are hopeful. \n\"Amazing things are happening in the world of beta cell regeneration,\" Stewart said. \nRakeman agreed. \"We understand much more about what's happening with beta cells. We can take those lessons and build out therapeutic targets,\" he said. \nThe study was published Oct. 3 in the journal Nature Communications . \nMore information \nThe American Association of Endocrine Surgeons has more on insulinomas .

Sadly, I\u2019m also lactose intolerant. I was diagnosed at age 17, after a bout of severe stomach pain landed me in the emergency room. But despite the diagnosis, I was never been able to completely give up dairy. Instead, I managed my symptoms by taking Lactaid pills and consuming dairy in small amounts (well, usually). For the most part, a little skim milk or butter here and there hadn\u2019t affected me too much. \nBut after a recent string of stomach cramps and bloating left me feeling awful, I started to wonder if omitting dairy from my diet might actually be a good idea. After all, elimination diets are all the rage, and other people claimed to have success with them. Supposedly, not only did people feel better after cutting out dairy, but many of them also noticed improved complexions and a thinner waistline. \nSo I decided to give up dairy for an entire month: yogurt, coffee creamer, pizza, everything. I admit I was hoping for a big change, but it wasn\u2019t exactly what I expected. \nRELATED VIDEO: Beyonc\u00e9 Launches a Vegan Food Service Week 1 \nI planned out my meals and stocked up on dairy-free groceries. That part was easy. What wasn\u2019t easy was the realization that while many restaurants have vegetarian, vegan , and gluten-free options, it was a lot harder to eat out on a dairy-free diet . When I asked servers which meals contained dairy, they\u2019d usually have to check with the chef, since nothing was labeled that way on the menu. And inevitably, most items would be prepared with at least a little butter. \nAs a result, within a day or two of giving up dairy, I found myself loading up on carbs. I tried to choose whole grains, but I was also snacking on more chips than usual. I think I was compensating for the fact that many of everyday diet staples, such as Greek yogurt, were now off the table\u2014and I admittedly wasn\u2019t as excited to replace those foods with veggies. Week 2 \nI felt good. My stomach aches had started to go away, and I was also less bloated. I figured out dairy-free substitutions for many of my go-to meals, such as peanut butter instead of butter on toast, almond milk instead of half-and-half in coffee, avocado instead of mayo on my sandwich. (Later, I discovered that mayo is dairy-free\u2014mind blown.) My husband and I wouldn\u2019t always cook with dairy prior to my experiment, so I didn\u2019t notice much of a difference at dinnertime, but I did miss shredded cheese on taco night . Tacos are not the same without cheese, in case you were wondering. Week 3 \nBy this time, I had a handle on which foods were dairy-free, and I started getting a little more adventurous with my meals. I even made a dairy-free mug dessert , which has since become my go-to whenever I\u2019m craving something sweet. I also noticed that my diet had become more balanced than when I first started the experiment, and I was consciously trying to replace dairy with healthy alternatives. Week 4 \nBefore I even hit the one-month mark, I had decided to continue a mostly dairy-free diet\u2014something I did not see coming. What really convinced me was the fact that my stomach aches had disappeared. In fact, I didn\u2019t have a single bout of nausea the entire month. I was also surprised to find I was craving fewer sweets, maybe since ice cream was off-limits. \nWhat didn\u2019t change? My skin, for one. My weight stayed exactly the same, too\u2014I didn\u2019t lose or gain a single pound. In that sense, eliminating dairy wasn\u2019t the magic fix for everything I\u2019d heard it might be. But I did feel better. I\u2019ve even been more motivated to hit the gym\u2014I don\u2019t know if that has anything to do with my dairy-free diet, but I\u2019ll take it. \nThis article originally appeared on Health.com Show Full Article ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T01:36:09.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bfbeea71ff650336f8f2197bd2bd6c24f0be908e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjm7Pu91MJIjYdvWPpHt71aempjDvHvAIiVveCPr_SGXzF5eeDPmHW2EHIE3gJWMbfSdYvIqVFtTi", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "One Type of Dementia Is Especially Costly - Health", "title_full": "One Type of Dementia Is Especially Costly - Health", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.994, "main_image": "http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium_16_9/public/money814.jpg?itok=K55QX5u7", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bfbeea71ff650336f8f2197bd2bd6c24f0be908e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjm7Pu91MJIjYdvWPpHt71aempjDvHvAIiVveCPr_SGXzF5eeDPmHW2EHIE3gJWMbfSdYvIqVFtTi", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "October", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "One Type of Dementia Is Especially Costly - Health", "text": "One Type of Dementia Is Especially Costly Annual bills for this early onset disease twice as high as for Alzheimer's, study says October 06, 2017 \nTHURSDAY, Oct. 5, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A type of early onset dementia known as frontotemporal degeneration appears to take an even more punishing toll on family finances than Alzheimer's disease, a new report suggests. \nFrontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is the most common type of dementia to strike men and women under 60, the study team noted. \nThe investigation revealed that families caring for a patient with FTD face an annual bill of nearly $120,000, on average. That's roughly twice the cost of caring for a senior with Alzheimer's, the researchers said. \n\"For years, we have known about the extraordinary economic burden shouldered by FTD caregivers, but now we have the numbers to prove it,\" said Susan Dickinson, CEO for the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration. \"This study shows that the financial toll of FTD is even more devastating than we imagined.\" \nThe study was led by Dr. James Galvin, of Florida Atlantic University College of Medicine. He and his colleagues surveyed 674 caregivers of patients with this early onset dementia. \nThe research team determined that the patient's young age is largely responsible for the enormously high cost of providing care. On top of rising personal health costs, families also must cope with the loss of the patient's prior income. They said family caregivers often leave their paid jobs as well. \nLooking at patients with this devastating disease, investigators found that the average patient's household income was between $75,000 and $90,000 a year before diagnosis. Those numbers fell to between $50,000 and $59,000 by one year after a diagnosis. \nMaking matters worse, poor financial decisions are a symptom of this type of dementia. Nearly six in 10 caregivers reported that their loved one had made bad choices with money, the research shows. \nThe findings were published online Oct. 4 in Neurology . \nMore information \nTo learn more, visit The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration .

Amanda MacMillan October 06, 2017 \nIf you\u2019re overweight or obese, losing a few pounds may save you some serious cash. A new study has shown that weight loss at any age resulted in significant financial perks, with people around age 50 saving the most\u2014an average of $36,278 (!) over the course of their lifetimes. \nThe new research, published in Obesity , is the first to take into account not only the medical costs associated with obesity and its related diseases, but also losses in productivity at work that could be attributed to weight. This helps paint a more complete picture of the real price tag of extra pounds, according to the authors. \n\u201cPeople often think of obesity as an insurance issue, and they know that expensive health care problems are associated with it,\u201d says lead author says Bruce Y. Lee, MD, executive director of the Global Obesity Prevention Center at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cBut they rarely think about the full magnitude of its societal and workplace costs.\u201d \nTo find these numbers, Dr. Lee and his colleagues developed a computer model to represent the U.S. adult population, and estimated lifetime health effects for people who were obese, overweight, or healthy weight at ages 20 through 80. The model simulated the health status of these three groups year by year, and tracked medical costs (to the insurer or health-care facility), productivity losses, and sick time they would likely sustain as a result of their weight. \nRELATED: 57 Ways to Lose Weight Forever, According to Science \nThey found that, at every age between 20 and 80, going from one weight category to another resulted in significant cost differences. A 20-year-old who goes from obese to overweight, for example, would save an average of $17,655 over his or her lifetime. If that same person went from obese to a healthy weight, those savings would grow to about $28,020. \nMiddle-age adults had even more to gain: The model suggested that an obese 40-year-old could save between $18,000 and $32,000 over their lifetime by losing enough to be simply overweight or a healthy weight. Cost savings peaked at age 50, with an average total savings of more than $36,000. \nThe cost gap between being obese versus overweight narrowed as people aged, so that people between 50 and 80 benefited much more from moving to the healthy weight category, rather than simply moving from obese to overweight. \u201cThis emphasizes the importance of weight loss as people get older,\u201d the study authors wrote in their paper, \u201cfor both individuals with obesity and individuals with overweight.\u201d \nTo get more weight loss tips, sign up for the HEALTH newsletter \nDr. Lee says it was a bit surprising that these cost savings remained significant throughout every decade of a person\u2019s life. \u201cSomeone might think that if they\u2019re 80 years old and they\u2019ve lived their entire life without losing weight, then maybe it\u2019s not worth trying at that point,\u201d he says. \u201cOur study suggests that if you really want to focus on reducing costs, then it is actually still important.\u201d \nDr. Lee points out that the productivity losses in the study were based on median wage\u2014and that if a person makes a higher-than-average salary, they\u2019re likely to lose even more because of obesity-related problems. \u201cYou\u2019re essentially forfeiting potential salary, you\u2019re going to the hospital and the doctor\u2019s office, you\u2019re getting too sick to work, or your life is getting cut short,\u201d he says. \nDr. Lee hopes the research helps employers realize the importance of prioritizing their workers\u2019 health and wellbeing. He also hopes it serves as an incentive for people who know they need to lose weight but haven\u2019t been motivated to do so for their health alone. \u201cEveryone is interested in trying to save money and maximize what they can do with their salary,\u201d he says, \u201cand this study suggests one way they can do that.\u201d You May Like ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amanda macmillan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bruce y. lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global obesity prevention center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T20:27:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "14d893e40de822dd5776c40d011b99f7031ca7ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjqXfVyi_rqPew5OiX6Wo4NJj81g2reyNy4GnQK3T291MPCPdYubrxC8-", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Starbucks Nutrition: The Healthy Starbucks Drinks to Get - Health", "title_full": "Starbucks Nutrition: The Healthy Starbucks Drinks to Get - Health", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium_16_9/public/styles/main/public/gettyimages-688663122.jpg?itok=-TNVoTk7", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 2290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 107, "comments": 0, "shares": 107}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "14d893e40de822dd5776c40d011b99f7031ca7ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjqXfVyi_rqPew5OiX6Wo4NJj81g2reyNy4GnQK3T291MPCPdYubrxC8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cynthia Sass", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Starbucks Nutrition: The Healthy Starbucks Drinks to Get - Health", "text": "Starbucks Nutrition: The Healthy Starbucks Drinks to Get \u2013 Health The Healthiest Drink Options at Starbucks (Beyond Black Coffee and Tea) \nSearch", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cynthia sass", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "starbucks", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "healthy starbucks drinks", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "beyond black coffee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york yankees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn nets", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san pellegrino", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T21:37:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1208b72f7c2d4d387e41676d0b317d34cb9c8f22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjhedzRnvneJyOXNRDITpx9wyK8jxYhJDLqA5yIGHx0F21pOJ49ljSyc-", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Genetics could be why divorce runs in families - Health", "title_full": "Genetics could be why divorce runs in families - Health", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.026, "main_image": "http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium_16_9/public/styles/main/public/gettyimages-82136836_1.jpg?itok=TeFaZ3Zv", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1208b72f7c2d4d387e41676d0b317d34cb9c8f22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjhedzRnvneJyOXNRDITpx9wyK8jxYhJDLqA5yIGHx0F21pOJ49ljSyc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Amanda Macmillan", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Genetics could be why divorce runs in families - Health", "text": "Relationships Is Divorce Hereditary?

Now, a forthcoming study in Psychological Science suggests that the reason may have more to do with nature than with nurture. In other words, an increased risk for divorce may be coded in our genes. \nTo determine whether genetic factors play a role in couples\u2019 likelihood of divorce, researchers in the United States and Sweden analyzed population data from nearly 20,000 Swedish adults who\u2019d been adopted as children.

By looking at adopted children, we\u2019re able to separate out the genetic factors and the environmental ones.\u201d \nSalvatore says the newly discovered hereditary connection is likely due to personality factors that have also been linked to genetics\u2014like neuroticism and impulsiveness . \u201cWe know from other studies that these are factors that contribute to divorce,\u201d she says. \u201cThey may make it more difficult for someone to stay in a relationship, or for someone to want to stay in a relationship with them.\u201d \nRELATED: 10 Things You Should Never Do When You're Angry \nBut Salvatore wants to emphasize that just because divorce appears to have has a genetic component, it doesn\u2019t mean that people whose parents split up are destined to do the same. \u201cThis is absolutely not a perfect predictor,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s simply an increased risk, just as if you had a parent with an alcohol-use disorder, you\u2019d also be at increased risk for developing one yourself.\" \nThe environment you were raised in still matters, too, she says. In fact, the study also looked at data from more than 80,000 adults who\u2019d been raised by a biological mother and a stepfather. In that sample, the researchers did find correlations between participants\u2019 divorce rates and the divorce rates of their biological fathers, with whom they did not live. But their mothers\u2019 marital history (with their stepfathers) was an even stronger predictor of their own marital success\u2014providing some evidence that childhood environments affected future divorce risk \u201cabove and beyond\u201d genetic influences alone, the authors wrote. \nSalvatore hopes her research can help people better understand the many factors that may put couples at risk for divorce. \u201cWe all bring liabilities into our relationships, whether we come from a happy, harmonious home or a troubled and fractured home,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd knowing how those liabilities work may help people reflect on and improve their own behavior in relationships.\u201d \nIt may also help guide therapists and counselors in making recommendations for couples who are struggling, she adds. \u201cOther research has suggested that children of divorced parents lack commitment to their relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cBut our findings really suggest that it may have more to do with certain personality factors, and that we may have to take a different approach in working with them.\u201d \nTo get our best relationship tips delivered to you inbox, sign up for the Healthy Living newsletter \nNeurotic people, for example, tend to interpret their partners\u2019 behavior more negatively than objective observers do, says Salvatore. \u201cIf a clinician knows this is happening, he or she can help reframe\u2014through cognitive behavioral therapy \u2014that person\u2019s perception of events in their relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can take the edge off of their interactions, so they're less hostile and give their partner the benefit of the doubt.\u201d \nBecause the study looked at Swedish individuals, Salvatore can\u2019t say for sure that the findings would translate to an American population. There are a lot of similarities between the two cultures, she says, but also some significant differences. The average age at marriage is higher in Sweden, for example, and the divorce rate is higher.

Or you rely on yours and can't go a day without it. Either way, the depression nap , a relatively new meme-worthy trend  all over social media, has made it to Urban Dictionary and Reddit\u2014so it\u2019s officially a thing.\nBut is it a good thing? Most of us (except maybe defiant toddlers) would love to squeeze in a nap during the day. But experts aren't so sure a depression nap\u2014or a quick snooze when you're feeling like the world is just too much right now\u2014is actually a smart idea.\n\"If [napping] is being used to avoid doing or confronting difficult things or is being done excessively while connected to depressed feelings or low energy, then it may be a symptom of a psychological disorder such as depression, anxiety , or insomnia,\" says Simon Rego, PsyD, chief psychologist at the Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.\nRELATED:  12 Signs You May Have an Anxiety Disorder \nSome people who swear by depression naps might feel tired all the time, sleep more than usual, and sleep as a way of escaping what's bothering them. The need to take a depression nap could signal clinical depression, as excessive sleepiness is one symptom of the disease.\nOn the other hand, sleeping too little can also be a sign of depression . Some people with depression feel restless and wound-up, leading to trouble falling or staying asleep. If you have a hard time dozing off at night, napping is probably off the table for you: Any daytime shut-eye may only make that process more difficult.\nBut napping can be good for other people. According to the National Sleep Foundation, a quick nap can improve alertness, strengthen your performance at work and cut back on mistakes and accidents, and, of course, help you feel relaxed and rejuvenated for the rest of your day. Some research even suggests a midday nap can lower blood pressure .\nWaking up refreshed and ready to tackle a difficult task is different than using sleep to ignore that challenge entirely, though. \"If you're napping to avoid a task that is difficult, in many cases, that's not an adaptive way of coping ,\" says sleep psychologist Kelly Baron, PhD, assistant professor in the department of behavioral sciences at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. \"Rather than confronting what's making you feel anxious and getting it over with, you're procrastinating, which can make anxiety feel worse.\"\nTo get our top stories delivered to your inbox, sign up for the HEALTH newsletter \nWhile it\u2019s totally normal to feel a little sleepy during the day\u2014especially in the afternoon, when there's a natural dip in our circadian rhythms, Baron says\u2014it's probably not so good if you feel like you need a nap to get through the day, every day. \"In these cases, it's important to seek help from a licensed mental health professional,\" Rego says. He or she may even point you to a sleep specialist, Baron adds, in case an undiagnosed condition like sleep apnea could be causing your daytime drowsiness.\nIf you need an occasional depression nap, there's probably no real harm to taking a little break from it all once in a while, as long as you're using that snooze to feel more alert and more productive when you wake. \"While napping itself is not necessarily a problematic behavior,\" Rego says, \"it's important to be clear on why you're napping.\"\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kelly baron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon rego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rego", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national sleep foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montefiore medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert einstein college of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rush university medical center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T00:26:14.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "103993d1829a2907f14ea1d839098db8af093322", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjok5ngFAqs4ndBEvYKorbWPQnRY_8QXtvMj0IHmdVVw5keetfLOq_eA-", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "What Your Sexual Fantasies Really Mean, Plus 5 Common Types - Health", "title_full": "What Your Sexual Fantasies Really Mean, Plus 5 Common Types - Health", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.212, "main_image": "http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium_16_9/public?itok=E2Im5_-x", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 85, "comments": 0, "shares": 85}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "103993d1829a2907f14ea1d839098db8af093322", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjok5ngFAqs4ndBEvYKorbWPQnRY_8QXtvMj0IHmdVVw5keetfLOq_eA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Julia Naftulin", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Your Sexual Fantasies Really Mean, Plus 5 Common Types - Health", "text": "What Your Sexual Fantasies Really Mean, Plus 5 Common Types Sex therapists uncover the desires behind fantasies of threesomes, bondage, spanking, and more. More 1 of 8 Why do people have sexual fantasies? \nEver fantasize about having a threesome? Or having your wrists bound to the bedpost in an extra-steamy sex session? Well, you are far from alone: For a study published in 2014 , researchers asked more than 1,000 adults about the contents of their sexual fantasies and found a few common themes . Fifty-seven percent of women, for example, said they had dreamt about having sex with two men, while 37% had fantasized about sex with two women. And 46% of men said they fantasized being tied up. \nBut why do we have fantasies in the first place? \"They're a powerful way to increase arousal, and distract from anxiety,\" explains Ian Kerner, PhD, a New York City-based sex therapist. \"A lot of people fantasize during sex and may be conflicted about it\u2014but the fantasy could be doing a valuable service of helping compartmentalize stressors that normally get in the way of arousal.\" In other words, they help you escape from everyday life, and reach that blissed-out state where nothing matters except what's happening right in the moment. \nNo two sexual fantasies are exactly alike, of course. But they do tend to fall into one of five categories: submission, domination, exhibitionism, voyeurism, and group sex. Scroll down to learn about the unspoken desires each type may represent. Advertisement 2 of 8 Jonatan Fernstrom/Getty Images Submission \nIn a submission fantasy, you make yourself vulnerable to the will of your partner in some way. Maybe you are blindfolded or handcuffed, or your partner whips or spanks you. This scenario can be especially thrilling if you're used to always being in control, Kerner explains. Imagine a CEO who spends the majority of her time telling others what to do and how to do it; she may be turned on by the idea of giving in completely to her sexual partner. \u201cMany fantasies offer a counter point to our real lives,\u201d he says. \nIn some cases, submission fantasies can be therapeutic, too. For a survivor of sexual assult, the scenario that unfolds in her imagination may be related to her trauma in some way: \"The fantasy offers the chance to reactivate a painful memory, but be in control,\" Kerner says. \"It can have a healing effect.\" \nHe gives this example: \"One woman I worked with who experienced date rape had a fantasy about being super girl, and her boyfriend is a villain with kryptonite that renders her weak.\" She was re-living her trauma, but in a safe environment, and through the lens of pleasure rather than pain, Kerner explains. 3 of 8 by_nicholas/Getty Images Domination \nA domination fantasy is all about being control, whether that means tying up your partner, or simply calling the shots on positions. These types of fantasies are popular among women who are in relationships with traditional gender roles, says Kerner. \u201cA normally submissive person who feels powerless a lot of the time may enjoy fantasies that center around her sexual power.\u201d \n4 of 8 Hummer/Getty Images Exhibitionism \nHave you ever thought about getting busy with the blinds open, excited by the possibility that a neighbor might catch you in the act? Or have you thought about what it would be like to have your partner watch you masturbate? If so, you may be turned on by so-called exhibitionism fantasies, another very common type. An exhibitionism fantasy involves any scenario in which you perform a sexual act for an audience, whether it's your husband or girlfriend or an unsuspecting neighbor. It can create a sense of vulnerability that can be a turn-on. \nTypically, sexual fantasies have one central theme, says Kerner. \"Most of them involve some kind of power exchange, one partner being vulnerable to another person's power,\" he explains. Advertisement 5 of 8 yavdat/Getty Images Voyeurism \nMany movies and television shows have depicted voyeurism, which is the act of secretly watching others engage in sexual acts. But voyeurism doesn't just happen on the big screen; it's the stuff of many fantasies too. In a voyeuristic fantasy, may want to watch your partner masturbate, for example, or spy on him via webcam. \nIt\u2019s important to note that not all sexual fantasies are scenarios people actually want to act out. The scenario may remain in the fantasy stage forever\u2014and that\u2019s perfectly O.K., says Gracie Landes, a New York City-based marriage and family therapist. \u201cFantasizing can simply be an escape, a way of daydreaming,\u201d she explains. \"Just like people don't share every thought that comes into their head, they don't need to share every fantasy.\u201d Advertisement 6 of 8 1001nights/Getty Images Group sex \nIn pop culture, threesome fantasies are often portrayed as a point of contention within relationships. But if you're in a committed relationship, says Kerner, a threesome fantasy probably has less to do with wanting sex with a stranger and more to do with wanting to see your partner in a state of pleasure. \nKerner says some couples interested in group sex will dip their toes in the scenario by going to a sex party and simply watching. If you are interested in actually trying a real-life threesome, Kerner suggests pitching the idea to your partner in a way that feels inclusive. Have an open dialogue about why you want to invite a third person in, he says. \"Present it in a way where you're not diverging from your partner,\" says Kerner. Rather, the idea is that you'd be experimenting together. Advertisement 7 of 8 Photography and Design by Demi C/Getty Images Is it healthy to act on a sexual fantasy? \nFor some people, simply talking out their fantasies is enough to create arousal and sexual fulfillment. But acting on your sexual fantasies is healthy as well, if done with proper communication. \"If [fantasies] enter reality, they need to be monitored and done safely and consensually,\" says Kerner. If you're interested in BDSM, for example, don't jump into it 50 Shades of Grey -style. Discuss expectations and limits with your partner before doing anything new and kinky. And this goes without saying, but don't act on sexual fantasies that are illegal or inappropriate for the workplace. Advertisement 8 of 8 Janet Kimber/Getty Images How to tell your partner about your fantasies \nIf you've decided that acting on your fantasies is something you want to do, broach the topic with your partner. For starters, ask permission to share your fantasy, says Landes. \"It's easier to share fantasies with someone you already share hopes, dreams, and creative thoughts with, who knows about how you imagine and daydream, and feels included in the process.\" \nWhen explaining your fantasy, consider how your partner feels about fantasies. Is she a dreamer, too? Does she think logically? You might talk about why you think you have a particular fantasy. Also be sure to convey that you want to have the fantasy with your partner. \nIf you partner is receptive, ask if she'd be interested in trying it IRL. But if you partner isn't interested, be respectful of her decision, and try to understand where she's coming from. \u201cI see too many couples where the person who has fantasies gets critical of the one who doesn't, and vice versa,\u201d says Landes. \"Some people are simply more inclined to fantasy and imagination than others.\" \nBottom line: Your sex life can still be fulfilling whether or not it includes acting out your fantasies.

Obviously, I can\u2019t wait for it to be gone, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m ashamed of or embarrassed of.\u201d You May Like", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rachel graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordaan spark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacqueline adan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julia naftulin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jessica weber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jana roller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacqueline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pdt  simone anderson", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T03:26:46.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c83f88372fb84aaf19fa7c2264c94f50492a73e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjhedzRnvneJy4hS05qpQ2vKcOyyojEhCM1jjdu1LPSISTUzDAi3CQMk-", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "http://www.health.com/health/food-recipes/feed", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Recipes - Health.com", "title": "Curried Pumpkin Soup", "title_full": "Curried Pumpkin Soup", "published": "2017-10-07T00:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium_16_9/public/1506958679/curried-pumpkin-soup-pumkin-power.jpg?itok=QvNQhMwq", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 25, "comments": 0, "shares": 25}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c83f88372fb84aaf19fa7c2264c94f50492a73e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjhedzRnvneJy4hS05qpQ2vKcOyyojEhCM1jjdu1LPSISTUzDAi3CQMk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Health", "published": "2017-10-07T00:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Curried Pumpkin Soup", "text": "How to Make It Step 1 \nHeat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat.

Add pears and cashews; cook, stirring often, until pears have softened, about 2 minutes.

Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer for 30 minutes. Step 3 \nWorking in batches, transfer soup to a high-speed blender. Remove center piece of blender lid to allow steam to escape; secure lid on blender and place a clean towel over opening in lid. Process until smooth, about 10 seconds. Return soup to Dutch oven over medium-low heat; stir in 2 cups broth and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. (Stir in up to 1/2 cup additional broth, if needed, to reach desired consistency.)

Anthea Levi October 05, 2017 \nThere's no way around it: A happy relationship takes hard work. And in his new book The All-or-Nothing Marriage ($28, amazon.com ) , psychologist Eli Finkel, PhD, tells you what you can do to make yours flourish. But if you don't have the time (or energy) to do any heavy lifting right now, there are a few shortcuts that can help improve things instantly. Finkel, who has studied thousands of couples, calls these quick fixes \"lovehacks.\" They take little time, and don't require any cooperation from your S.O.; yet they can make a big difference. \"Lovehacking involves a deliberate effort to see the beautiful underneath the anger and disappointment and boredom,\" Finkel writes in the book, \"to look with (appreciative) new eyes.\" Here are five of his tips to try: \nRELATED: 10 Ways to Improve Your Relationship Instantly Rethink the blame game \nWhen your partner (inevitably) slips up, there are multiple ways you can think about it, says Finkel. Let\u2019s say he forgot about dinner plans. Considering his mistake a sign of his inherent selfishness\u2014or wrongfully assuming he did it to spite you\u2014is likely to lead to unnecessary conflict and antagonism. Instead, consider all the possible explanations for the mistake: Maybe he forgot because he's been particularly busy at work, or because he's stressed about his father's illness. \nAs long as you\u2019re convinced your partner is a good person, Finkel suggests adopting this if/then strategy: \u201c If I start feeling frustrated or angry about something my spouse did (or didn\u2019t do), then I will take a few seconds to consider other explanations for his or her behavior.\u201d \nRELATED: 10 Things You Should Never Do When You're Angry Stop brushing off praise \nPeople who struggle with low self-esteem tend to have trouble believing that their partner truly loves them\u2014and that insecurity can keep them from appreciating compliments from their S.O. Luckily, there\u2019s a love hack for that, says Finkel. \nOne 2008 study asked folks with low self-esteem to describe a compliment they received from their partner in three different ways. One group was asked to describe the event. A second group was asked to relay exactly what their partner said, plus any details about the event (like the time or place). A third group was asked to think more broadly about the praise: They were prompted to explain what their partner admired about them, how it made them feel, and what it meant for their relationship. \nTwo weeks later, people in the first two groups reported feeling less secure in their relationships compared to people in the third group, who reported feeling more assured of their bond . \nFinkel's takeaway: Before you dismiss a compliment, take a second to appreciate why your spouse said it, and what the comment reflects about your relationship. \nRELATED: You'd Never Know by Looking at Me, But I'm in an Open Marriage Change how you see conflict \nJust because you run into challenges doesn\u2019t mean you and your partner aren\u2019t \"meant to be.\" Instead of viewing rough patches as signs your marriage is destined to fail, embrace those times as opportunities to improve your relationship. \nFinkel explains that people who have strong \"destiny beliefs\" are more likely to give up on their relationship, rather than try to work things out. Meanwhile, people who have strong \"growth beliefs\" see conflict as a chance to grow together. \nWith the right attitude, arguing can actually bring you closer. \nRELATED: 1 9 Reasons You Don't Want to Have Sex Anymore Cultivate gratitude, then express it \nResearch shows that practicing gratitude delivers plenty of health benefits, from better sleep to more motivation to exercise. But feeling grateful can also do wonders for your romantic relationship. A 2011 study published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences found that the more partners experience and express gratitude for their spouse , the more satisfied they feel with their marriage. Plus, \u201cpeople who experience elevated levels of gratitude also experience stronger relationship commitment and are less likely to break up,\u201d writes Finkel. So go ahead and tell your wife how much you appreciate all that she does for you; or the next time she does something sweet, leave her a thank you note. These simple gestures can go a long way. \nTo get more relationship advice, sign up for the HEALTH newsletter Get happy for each other \nThe next time you get good news, celebrate with your boo! Research suggests that sharing positive events not only builds trust, but also increases feelings of intimacy and satisfaction with the relationship. And both partners experience these perks, not just the bearer of the good news: \u201cThe positive effects emerge not only for the partner doing the disclosing, but also for the listener,\u201d says Finkel.

Watch the video to learn how to get the look\u2014and all about the palette. October 06, 2017 \nWhether you\u2019re a beauty novice or a pro, the goal is the same when you set out to apply makeup: you want it to look good. To do this, there are things you should take into account\u2014like your coloring. But that\u2019s where things can start to get a little confusing and overwhelming, so much so that you might just give up. \nTo the rescue is an eye shadow palette with so many choices, it\u2019s a cinch to create a stunning look no matter what your skin tone is, we promise. Makeup artists agree that warmer-toned shadows are most flattering because they have the power to wake up your face and make eyes pop . The new Huda Beauty palette , called Desert Dusk, offers 18 versatile shades\u2014 from a rich orange called Blazing to a dimensional purple-y glitter that changes color when it catches the light\u2014all designed to complement each other. \nWatch the video: Master Glowy Skin With This Warm-Toned Makeup Look \nFor the look created on the 5 models in this video, we stuck to the peach-toned hues , using two mattes (Eden on the lid and Amber on the crease), two pressed pearl shades (Blood Moon for the smokey effect on the outer corner and Nefertiti on the inner corner, blended toward the middle of the lid), and a duo-chrome topper (Celestial on top of Nefertiti). \nThe end result looks gorgeous on all of the models, but it\u2019s easy to see that the colors read differently on each girl\u2014for example, one swipe of some shades really show up well on lighter skin, but it took a few extra passes on darker skin to look the same.

Julia Naftulin October 09, 2017 \nIf you follow Ashley Graham on social media, you're no stranger to the supermodel's fit-stagrams. Graham constantly posts inspiring videos of her workouts at go-to gym The Dogpound, where she does everything from boxing to strength training. \nBut some of Graham's followers, or should we say trolls, are constantly hating on her exercise game. On Sunday, the body-positive activist took to Instagram to share a little known secret about her workout posts. \n\"EVERYTIME [sic] after I post a workout video I get get [sic] comments like..'You'll never be skinny so stop trying,' 'Don't workout too hard, you'll get skinny,' 'You still need your fat to be a model,' 'Why would you want to loose what made you famous,'\" Graham wrote in her post . A post shared by A S H L E Y G R A H A M (@theashleygraham) on Oct 8, 2017 at 7:36pm PDT \nIn typical Graham fashion, she shut down the haters by explaining her reasons for hitting the gym so hard. None of them have to do with losing weight; instead, \"feel good,\" \"get rid of jet lag,\" and \"clear my head\" made Graham's list. And the model knows what she's talking about, because research backs up these and other health benefits of exercise. \nRELATED: Ashley Graham Shares a Bikini Hack That Will Save You From Dreaded \u2018Halter Ache\u2019 \nTo her point about feeling good: a sweat session can boost levels of the hormones endorphins, plus reduce stress and anxiety. A 2014 study also found that hitting the gym can improve memory, since aerobic exercise was linked to an increased hippocampus, the area of the brain that controls memory function. Regular exercise keeps your heart healthy, and as Graham noted, makes your body flexible, which can improve blood circulation. \nWhile it's totally fine to hit the treadmill or weight rack to slim down, if weight loss isn't your objective, you're hardly alone\u2014you have one of the world's most famous models in your corner.

And that\u2019s a good thing, considering an estimated 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in women in the U.S. this year alone, according to the American Cancer Society. \nOne such brand using their platform to raise awareness and give back: Athleta. In addition to donating to ROW (Recovery on Water), a rowing team for breast cancer patients and survivors, the fitness apparel company recently introduced the Empower Bra ($54; athleta.com ). This new athletic supporter ranges in size from XXS to XL and is specifically designed for women who have undergone single or bilateral mastectomy . \nRELATED VIDEO: Elizabeth Hurley Shares How You Can Help The Fight Against Breast Cancer \nThe Empower bra was developed with input from two-time breast cancer survivor Kimberly Jewett (who also models the bra on the brand\u2019s website) and wear-tested by several other breast cancer patients. You\u2019ll still find the typical features any good sports bra should have, such as sweat-wicking material, a comfortable fit, and on-trend style. \nBut the design also takes into consideration the specific needs of women who have had a mastectomy. The front-zip style with hook and eye closure makes it easy to get on and off, while the fabric is soft and free of wires so as not to irritate post-operation skin. Also good: extended mesh pockets to accommodate most post-surgery prosthetics and adjustable straps for a perfect fit. \nMaking sure all women feel comfortable and supported in their skin?

Yet sexual harassment on the job is undeniably and disappointingly common among regular folks too, as writer Anne T. Donahue made clear this week.\n\u201cWhen did you meet YOUR Harvey Weinstein?\u201d Donahue tweeted. She went on to offer her own story as a potent example. \u201cI was a 17-yr-old co-op student and he insisted on massaging my shoulders as I typed.

There's a difference between feeling a little self-conscious about a body area and full-blown obsessing over it. Julia Naftulin October 10, 2017 \nKim Kardashian is all about a perfectly posed selfie and expertly contoured face. But even she experiences a self-esteem plunge when she hears negative comments about her body. On the most recent episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians , Kim opened up about the toll being in the public eye has had on her body image. \nIn the episode, unretouched bikini photos of Kardashian went viral online. While dealing with the fallout, she admitted that her body insecurity has increased over the years. \u201cYou take pictures and people just body shame you,\" Kardashian said. \"It\u2019s like literally giving me body dysmorphia,\" she also commented. \nRELATED: Kim Kardashian Swears By This $500 Moisturizing Cream. Here\u2019s Why a Dermatologist Says It\u2019s Not Worth It \nThe term \"body dysmorphia\" has a buzz to it these days, and it's often thrown around by people who feel a little self-conscious about their appearance. But it's actually a true mental health condition\u2014and nothing to take lightly. Body dysmorphia is \"the preoccupation of imagined defects in one's appearance,\" says Tom Hildebrandt, PsyD, chief of the Division of Eating and Weight Disorders at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. \nA person with body dysmorphia typically sees a specific body part or a group of body parts and thinks, my calves look weak or my face is so ugly and out of proportion . They become obsessed with these thoughts and let them take over their lives. \"Obsessed\" is not an exaggeration. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) , body dysmorphic disorder, or BDD, is a type of obsessive compulsive disorder. The International OCD Foundation says BDD affects 1 in 50 people, or between 5 and 7.5 million people in the United States alone. \nBased on one episode of her show, it's hard to know if Kardashian has BDD or just doesn't always like the way she looks. What signs can tell you that your body obsession truly is BDD? It's more than being critical of your appearance from time to time. Says Hildebrandt: \"For someone with BDD, their entire life's balance hangs on whether they look okay or whether they've camouflaged their perceived flaw appropriately.\" \nTo get our best wellness tips delivered to you inbox, sign up for the Healthy Living newsletter \nWhen a person believes she has body issues and is hyper-aware of them, she may avoid social situations to not draw attention to her so-called flaws. She might also go to extremes to hide the perceived flaw, say by walking around with her hair covering her face or going under the knife. \"People with the resources may get plastic surgery and go back repeatedly for more, because it only provides a temporary release from the anxiety about their appearance,\" explains Hildebrandt. \nIn KUWTK , Kim says that her body dysmorphia comes from all the body-shaming comments she receives from haters, trolls, and others in the general public. While negative remarks can make BDD worse, they aren't typically the cause of the disorder, says Hildebrandt. \nRELATED: 10 Signs You May Have OCD \nThe actual cause of BDD isn't known, but it may be similar to what triggers OCD. Hildebrandt says people with certain temperaments and ways of thinking are predisposed to BDD and may show OCD tendencies in other areas of their life. For example, a person who obsesses over her legs may also be obsessed with keeping a spotless home. \"[It's] a cognitive style that causes you to prioritize things that are out of place rather than the big picture,\" says Hildebrandt. \nWorried about a friend who displays BDD behavior? Take note of how often she tries to conceal parts of her face or body, or if she constantly seeks reassurance about a specific body region. If you or a loved one think you're suffering from it, talking to a therapist or counselor is a smart option. Treatment includes antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy. \nBDD shouldn't be used carelessly as a slang term for someone who isn't 100% pleased with her body. We all have moments when we wished we were slimmer, had more muscle tone, or were taller or shorter. But when a person's entire life is dedicated to hiding and obsessing over perceived flaws, it's a serious mental health issue that needs to be addressed.

Just like the pores on your face, hair follicles on your scalp can become clogged with dirt, oil, and product buildup. Look for shampoos containing selenium sulfide, salicylic acid, or pyrithione zinc, such as Clear Scalp & Hair Intense Hydration Shampoo ($6; amazon.com ), to slough off dead skin and excess styling goop. Instead of dumping a dollop on your head, start lathering at the nape of the neck and work up toward the hairline, recommends New York City hairstylist Nunzio Saviano: \"Hair at the nape is thicker, so it traps sweat, gets oily and usually needs the most cleaning.\" 3 of 11 Getty Images Lay off the heat \nHot tools may seem innocent enough, but using them every day will weaken and dry out hair, leading to breakage and dullness. \"The most damage usually occurs during those final minutes of styling, when women are perfecting their hair with a flat iron or curling wand,\" says Elizabeth Cunnane-Phillips, a trichologist at Philip Kingsley in New York City.

Amanda MacMillan \nWhen it comes to drinking water, more is always better... right? Not necessarily. \nDespite being told for years that we should all be gulping down eight 8-ounce glasses a day, the actual amount of fluids we need varies from person to person. Now, a new study has revealed what happens in our brains, and our bodies, when we\u2019ve reached our hydration limit\u2014and why it might be dangerous to ignore the feeling that you\u2019ve had enough. \nThe research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States of America , found that people had a harder time swallowing after consuming excess amounts of water. This appears to be a protective response to prevent over-drinking, the authors say, which can lead to a potentially fatal condition called hyponatremia, also known as water toxicity. \nFor the study, the researchers put 20 people in functional MRI (fMRI) scanners and asked them to rate the effort level required to swallow small amounts of water under two different conditions\u2014after exercising, when they were thirsty; and later, after they\u2019d already drank about a liter of water. \nThe participants rated swallowing in the second scenario three times more difficult than in the first. This was true for both plain water and for water sweetened with sugar. \nThis showed that they had to \u201covercome some sort of resistance,\u201d co-author Michael Farrell, Ph.D., associate professor at Monash University in Australia, said in a press release. \u201cThis was compatible with our notion that the swallowing reflex becomes inhibited once enough water has been drunk.\" \nThis \u201cswallowing inhibition\u201d seems to help regulate water intake and maintain fluid levels in the human body, the authors wrote, but it\u2019s not foolproof. After all, the participants were still able to swallow, even though it was harder than usual. \nIn fact, fMRI scans showed that the right prefrontal areas of participants\u2019 brains were much more active when they were trying to swallow after overdrinking\u2014suggesting that the frontal cortex steps in to override the inhibition and allow swallowing on command. \nWhen the body is flooded with water, sodium levels can become abnormally low\u2014a condition called hyponatremia that can lead to lethargy, nausea, seizures, and even death. People who lose a lot of sodium through sweat and don\u2019t replenish their levels (with salt or an electrolyte beverage) are especially at risk. \nThankfully, the study participants hadn\u2019t consumed huge amounts of water, and weren\u2019t in any actual danger. But there are times when people may have more water than is safe, say the authors, and may disregard signals from their brains to stop drinking. \n\"There have been cases when athletes in marathons were told to load up with water and died, in certain circumstances, because they slavishly followed these recommendations and drank far in excess of need,\" Farrell said. \nOf course, not drinking enough water is also a common problem in athletes, and in non-athletes as well. Mild dehydration may not lead directly to serious health problems, but it has been linked to low energy levels , headaches , constipation , and even obesity . \nFarrell pointed out that elderly people, especially often don\u2019t drink enough water and should watch their intake of fluids. \nSo how much fluid should you get every day? The Institute of Medicine recommends that men aim for 125 ounces and women aim for 91 ounces a day, but that includes water from foods and other beverages\u2014like juice, tea, and yes, even coffee\u2014as well. That number can also vary based on your age, weight, other health conditions, and how active (and how sweaty) you are. \nIn short, says Farrell, don\u2019t try to force anything. \u201cJust drink according to thirst rather than an elaborate schedule,\u201d he said. \"If we just do what our body demands us to we'll probably get it right.\u201d \nThis article originally appears on RealSimple.com.

Ginny Graves October 10, 2017 \nMost recovering addicts talk about a \u201cbottom\u201d\u2014a devastating low point that finally made them see they needed to change their behavior. \"Mine haunts me and fills me with enormous remorse to this day,\u201d says Dana Smith. \nIt was July 2009. Dana was 25, and had been abusing a variety of drugs for the past 10 years. \u201cDuring those years, I lost a boyfriend to suicide and watched several friends overdose,\u201d she says. Her parents did everything they could think of to try to help, including sending her through three rounds of expensive rehab. \u201cI was hopeless and truly didn't see a way out.\u201d \nThen one night, while driving under the influence of heroin and Xanax in the Chicago suburbs, where she lived at the time, she reached her nadir. \u201cI fell asleep behind the wheel, crossed the center line and struck a man going the opposite direction on a motorcycle,\u201d says Dana. \u201cHe had been married for 20 years and had a 15-year-old daughter. I took an innocent person\u2019s life. I took a father and husband from his family, and nothing can ever change that.\u201d \nRELATED: What Carrie Fisher's Death Can Teach Us About Drug Addiction Getting fit behind bars \nDana was arrested the day of the accident and sent to county jail for a year, then to state prison for four years. \u201cI had lots of time to think,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew the only way I could try to make amends for what I had done was to commit to a sober lifestyle\u2014and vow that someday I\u2019d help other people, as well.\u201d \nTo give her life structure and discipline, she began meditating and doing hour-long workouts. With no gym and little space in her jail cell, she did pushups and burpees and crunches on the floor and created imaginative new ways to get fit. \n\u201cBefore I was incarcerated, I had worked part-time in a health club, so I knew how to do a lot of exercises\u2014and my parents gave me subscriptions to fitness magazines so I could find new exercise routines that didn't require equipment,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d jump rope with an imaginary rope, or I\u2019d throw a whole deck of cards on the floor and do squats to pick them up.\u201d \nRELATED: Why Your Butt Is Staying Flat No Matter How Much You Work Out \nThe physical activity brought her out of the murky mental state she\u2019d been living in while she was addicted. \u201cI began to think more clearly, and while many of my thoughts were extremely painful, I also started to regain a sense of self-worth and self-control\u2014things that had been missing from my life for years.\u201d \n\"Fitness was an escape from the chaos and violence of prison, as well,\u201d Dana says. And she became known to her fellow offenders as an expert on the topic. \u201cOther women would come to me to ask how to do squats or crunches,\u201d she says. \u201cThe ones who wanted to be healthy and stay out of trouble gravitated to me\u2014which meant my social network remained safe and positive.\" \nStill, she worried constantly about what would happen when she was released. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get a job as a felon,\u201d she says. So she got permission from the warden to take a personal training course. \u201cThe company mailed me a textbook and I earned my certificate while I was behind bars,\u201d she says. She also got married while she was incarcerated\u2014to a straight-laced guy she\u2019d dated as a teen. \u201cOur relationship started with letter-writing, then he began visiting and we fell in love,\u201d she says. \u201cTo this day, he\u2019s my best friend and strongest source of support.\u201d Healing herself\u2014and others \nWhen she was released in 2014, Dana worked as a personal trainer and strength coach in Chicago\u2014then, after completing her parole, moved with her husband to Denver to volunteer at Phoenix Multisport (now The Phoenix ), a fitness center for people recovering from a substance use disorder. Now she\u2019s director of the facility\u2019s programs and partnerships. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a way for me to give back and help other people\u2014and it helps me, too,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m immersed in a community of sober, active peers who support my recovery\u2014and I do CrossFit and strength-training regularly. Exercise was, and continues to be, the outlet that gives me stability and keeps me strong, mentally and physically.\u201d \nNow 33, Dana is expecting her first child, and she never takes her life for granted. \u201cI can\u2019t change what I did,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I can do my best to heal myself and help others.\u201d You May Like", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dana s", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carrie fisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ginny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dana smith", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "phoenix multisport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crossfit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T06:41:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a429db641f52039c218d49054352d9b2daf02f7d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjkCo3JdC73191mo55QIVsbCCii3Z95PhfULi2wWIYGpSdhiiCLQdRJTz4C5QlwIIyFXcAEvc_G7L", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "http://www.health.com/health/diet-fitness/feed", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Fitness - Health.com", "title": "Hundreds of People Are Posting Nude Yoga Photos on Instagram\u2014Here\u2019s What Inspired Them", "title_full": "Hundreds of People Are Posting Nude Yoga Photos on Instagram\u2014Here\u2019s What Inspired Them", "published": "2017-10-10T23:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium_16_9/public/styles/main/public/gettyimages-147020262.jpg?itok=INm43zTe", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 2290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3497, "comments": 0, "shares": 3497}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a429db641f52039c218d49054352d9b2daf02f7d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjkCo3JdC73191mo55QIVsbCCii3Z95PhfULi2wWIYGpSdhiiCLQdRJTz4C5QlwIIyFXcAEvc_G7L", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Health", "published": "2017-10-10T23:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Hundreds of People Are Posting Nude Yoga Photos on Instagram\u2014Here\u2019s What Inspired Them", "text": "Email Pete Saloutos/Getty Images \nSince 2015, the anonymous model and photographer known simply as Nude Yoga Girl has been sharing nude self-portraits on Instagram.

Sports Helped Me Get My Life Back Marine veteran Kirstie Ennis survived a helicopter crash and devastating injuries. Now she\u2019s climbing mountains. Ginny Graves October 10, 2017 \nAt age 21, Kirstie Ennis was living the life of her dreams. The daughter of two Marines, she had enlisted at 17 and was flying combat and rescue missions in Afghanistan as an aerial observer and gunner. \u201cI was the eyes and ears for the pilot, letting him know what\u2019s going on behind and around him,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m small\u20145\u20194\u201d and 115 pounds\u2014and as a woman I had to fight tooth and nail to prove that I could do the job. But it was worth it. I loved everything about it.\u201d \nJune 23, 2012, started like any other day. She and her team had already completed one mission and were en route to pick up Marines who were pinned down in an active combat zone in Helmand Province, when their helicopter suddenly went nose down, then rolled to the left and crashed. \u201cI just watched the ground come towards me and hoped I would open my eyes afterward,\u201d she recalls. Rebuilding a life \nKirstie suffered a traumatic brain injury as well as severe damage to her face, spine, shoulders and left leg. \u201cWhen you're recovering from a traumatic injury, you don't just lose yourself physically but mentally and emotionally,\u201d she says now. \u201cYou wonder if you'll ever be the same person again. For me that was a pretty huge internal battle.\u201d \nOne year after the accident, on her \u201cAlive Day,\u201d as critically injured vets call their traumatic anniversaries, she tried to take her own life. \u201cIt was a very dark time, and I thought I didn't want to be here anymore,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter my suicide attempt, my dad was the one who talked some sense into me. He said, \u2018The enemy didn't kill you. Why would you try to do it yourself? You\u2019re tougher than that.\u2019 It was just what I needed to hear.\u201d \nRELATED: How to Spot the Warning Signs of Suicide \nAfterward, Kirstie stopped dwelling on what she couldn't do and began thinking about what she could do. Several months before, a group called Disabled Sports USA had taught her to snowboard, and she loved it. \u201cDuring the following season, I trained hard, and that became my lifeline,\u201d she says. \u201cSnowboarding restored my confidence and gave me joy. It literally got me up on my own two feet again.\u201d Seeking new summits \nIn the years after the crash, Kristie endured dozens of surgeries to reconstruct her face and attempt to save her left leg. Then in 2015, doctors had to amputate the leg\u2014first below the knee, then, after an infection set in, above the knee. \u201cWith an above-the-knee amputation you\u2019re basically starting from scratch in learning how to use your leg again,\u201d she says. \nInstead of losing hope, she got hungry.

I love being married so much.\u201d There\u2019s definitely a slumber party vibe happening, what with all the talk about boys and sex (kind of), and it\u2019s hard not to imagine you\u2019re in the sleepover scene in Grease \u2014the live TV version starring Julianne as Sandy (if you missed it, at least Google her singing \u201cHopelessly Devoted to You\u201d). \nUtah-born Julianne\u2014Jules to her friends\u2014the youngest of five, is 29 now, and she\u2019s come a long way since her debut, at 18, as one of the pros on Dancing with the Stars . In the past decade, she\u2019s done movies ( Footloose, Rock of Ages ) and TV (aside from Grease Live! , she has spent a handful of seasons as a DWTS judge) and released a self-titled album, which hit number three on the Billboard 200 chart. Earlier this year, she and her brother, Derek, starred in MOVE Beyond , a live dance stage show that sold out venues such as Radio City Music Hall. \nNow she\u2019s so big-time that her wedding (to Canadian ice hockey player Brooks Laich, 34, in July) was on the cover of People . But in this bedroom today, wearing all-black athleisure and exuding her signature super-positive energy, there is not one ounce of prtentiousness. Jumping up to show the occasional dance or workout move, she is just goofy, down-to-earth Jules. \nIt was fun to follow your honeymoon on Instagram. Was anything off-limits? \nWe had a lot of photos that we took for our private collection, for sure. [Laughs] But at the same time, a lot of people were like, \u201cThat should be your private time.\u201d But part of our enjoyment is taking pictures and having these memories last forever, and setting up our tripod and doing all our own photos. And, hey, we\u2019re frickin\u2019 in the Seychelles and the Indian Ocean, and on a safari, so yeah, if it inspires somebody to go and do that, I\u2019m 100 percent gonna put that out there. \nWhat\u2019s the best part of being married? \nI\u2019ve always wanted to be married and be a mom and have kids, but to be honest, all of that scared the s\u2014 out of me. I was like, \u201cOh my gosh, to actually be married and committed to somebody, that just seems so grown-up.\u201d But the first thing that I felt when we got married was, \u201cThis is the complete opposite of scary. This is like home.\u201d How do you and Brooks motivate each other? And did I see you working out on your honeymoon? \nYeah. But that was at the beginning of the honeymoon! [Laughs] He motivates me so much because [working out is] a way of life for him, because of his career but also because he enjoys doing it. When we first got together, Brooks said, \u201cProtect the things that are important to you,\u201d and for me, working out and having my alone time is so important to me, and it\u2019s the same for him, too. Do you work with a trainer? \nI do, but I change it up. It\u2019s not one specific trainer who does everything. I work with a trainer at Body by Simone or one at Tracy Anderson, or I\u2019ll do SoulCycle or CorePower Yoga with different trainers. I\u2019m a dancer, so I remember different combinations, so I\u2019ll sometimes take what I\u2019ve learned in classes and make my own workout. Were you working out during the tour, or was the show enough? \nThat show was two hours every day, and sometimes twice a day. Definitely on two-a-days I didn\u2019t work out at all. Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t do a heavy workout, but I would put my wrist weights on and do my arms or my legs or something beforehand, just to mix it up and shock my body. \nDo you ever have a bad day? \nOh my gosh, totally. And that\u2019s the thing\u2014I do try to stay as positive as possible, and people always comment on that, but I also work at it. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m, like, Miss Positive perfect girl, wake up and everything\u2019s sunshine and rainbows. You don\u2019t wake up with cartoon birds flying around your head? \nExactly. No, I have my days for sure. The other day, I was having a major endometriosis \u201cepisode\u201d is what I call them, and I was just quiet. We went to the beach, and it was fine, but I wasn\u2019t active. I didn\u2019t want to play Spikeball and I didn\u2019t want to play Frisbee, and later, Brooks was like, \u201cHey, are you OK?\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m just not feeling very good.\u201d He was like, \u201cOh, I just thought you were in a bad mood. You need to tell me that because I don\u2019t know.\u201d So, trust me, I have my days. Sometimes I don\u2019t want to work out, and so sometimes I don\u2019t. Sometimes I\u2019m just like, \u201cI deserve a day off\u2014I\u2019m fine.\u201d But sometimes I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, come on, I know I\u2019m gonna feel better afterward.\u201d The end result is always the best. There\u2019s never been a time I\u2019ve finished a workout and been like, \u201cI totally regret doing that.\u201d Do you have a least favorite move? \nOh my goodness. You know those sliding round disks where you put one foot there and you do your inner thighs, or you\u2019re crossing behind? Anything to do with inner or outer thighs\u2014that\u2019s my struggle point, so I\u2019m always trying to work on that part of my body. I love doing abs and I love doing arms, so legs are always the hardest for me. But they\u2019re the most rewarding. \nDo you ever have a moment when you look in the mirror and are like, \u201cUgh\u201d? \nOh, well, the other day, when we were at the beach and I was having my endo stuff, and we got paparazzi\u2019d and I literally was like, \u201cOh my God.\u201d My stomach was like\u2014people were asking me if I was pregnant. I definitely have my moments for sure. But it\u2019s not so much what I look like; it\u2019s how I feel. When I don\u2019t work out, I can tell I\u2019m not as limber, I\u2019m not as quick, my brain\u2019s not as sharp. When I\u2019m physical, I\u2019m like, \u201cAaah! I\u2019m free!\u201d I feel blah when I don\u2019t feel free, and I feel free when I\u2019m working out. \nRELATED: Wedding Details! Going Inside Julianne Hough & Brooks Laich\u2019s Elegant Idaho Reception What else do you do to stay healthy? \nMe time. If I don\u2019t have my space for an hour, I feel overwhelmed and I need to just chill. That can be having a cup of tea by myself outside, going and getting gas\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter; I just need some time every day where I can think and put myself in a good place. I always try to wake up and think about three things that I\u2019m grateful for: something that has happened already, something I\u2019m currently grateful for, and something that I\u2019m wanting that I can achieve that day. What do you eat in the morning? \nI always wake up and we make fresh juices. It\u2019s mainly kale, cucumber, spinach, sometimes beets, celery, lemon, ginger. For sweetness we\u2019ll do apple or carrots. I have half a protein shake before I work out because I need a little bit of energy, but I\u2019m one of those people who can\u2019t have a full breakfast. Brooks can have, like, a tub of oatmeal, and I\u2019m like, \u201cI would throw up.\u201d When I finish the workout, I finish the protein shake. Then I come home and have a bowl of oatmeal and berries or something like that. \nTell me more about your endometriosis struggle. When did you realize you had it? \nI thought I was just like every other girl\u2014getting her period and having cramps. I\u2019d see my mom and my sisters all have bad cramps, but being a dancer, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m a tough cookie.\u201d I remember moving to L.A. when I was 18, and my roommate had endo, and I was like, \u201cWell, that sounds too medical, and I have no idea what that means. It\u2019s over my head.\u201d But then I saw her and was like, \u201cThat looks like the kind of pain that I have.\u201d Again, I didn\u2019t care because I was 18. Then I was on Dancing , during one of my last seasons as a dancer, and all of a sudden while I was dancing, something happened and I just doubled over. They cut to commercial, and my mom was in the audience that day, so she\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re going to the hospital. I don\u2019t care what you say.\u201d It took so long to figure out what was going on. Finally one doctor said, \u201cI think you might have endometriosis, and it looks pretty bad.\u201d I needed surgery\u2014I had it everywhere, to the point that they took my appendix out because it was so bad. How would you explain endo to someone who doesn\u2019t know what it is? \nIt\u2019s complicated and confusing, but basically, the uterine lining is growing outside [the uterus]. It can look like a spiderweb, and what happens is it contracts and cramps. For me it\u2019s an immediate sharp pain, like a stabbing sensation. It hurts so bad. It\u2019s ongoing. But the thing that\u2019s great about it is a few things happened: Dancing knew about it, so then I didn\u2019t feel as guilty or bad or like I was a weak little woman, or like, \u201cOh, I need to be strong,\u201d because they understood me. And then also, my mom and two of my sisters found out they had endo. They had been doing the same thing I was, where they didn\u2019t do anything about it because they were like, \u201cWe\u2019re strong.\u201d And I\u2019ve had so many people who message me on social media saying, \u201cThank you so much. Because of you I had the courage to go to my doctor and ask about this.\u201d \nWhat do you do to feel better? \nA hot bath. I have a hot water bottle that I call the boiling baby, and I sleep with it and put it next to me. Also, stretching and almost breaking a little bit of a sweat. You don\u2019t have to, like, go for a run, but just getting my heart rate up helps with the blood flow. Anything else about endo you wish people knew? \nFor me, especially with this campaign [I\u2019m partnering with], Get in the Know About ME in Endometriosis , it\u2019s that it\u2019s OK to talk about these kinds of things. In the past, it was kind of a hush-hush thing, but it\u2019s a way of life. My husband is the most sporty, Canadian, manly of men, and so he doesn\u2019t know anything to do with women in that sense, so for me to tell him, he was like, \u201cWait, what?\u201d But now he\u2019s so open about it. And by the way, to be in my family, you have to know that the word \u201cvagina\u201d is gonna be out there all the time. That\u2019s how we end all of our conversations\u2014something about vaginas. [Laughs] \nFavorite healthy snack? Hummus and veggies and always fruit. Perfect Bars are yummy little protein bars. \n#Vacationgoals: They say once you get bit by the Africa bug, you don\u2019t want to go anywhere else. And it\u2019s totally true. Next I want to go to Rwanda, Botswana, and Tanzania. \nNetflix and (literally) chill: I\u2019m so late to the party with Making a Murderer, but it\u2019s so great. \nGo-to cocktail: I made this up: It\u2019s Hendrick\u2019s Gin, St-Germain, a splash of grapefruit, mint, and lime. It is so good, but it is so dangerous, because you can\u2019t taste the alcohol. One and you\u2019re done. \nPhotography by James White. Styling by Karen Shapiro.

Health Editor \nHand towels are the top contamination hazard in the kitchen, according to a study. \nCellphones are another potential source of kitchen cross-contamination, the researchers found. \nCross-contamination refers to the accidental transfer of potentially hazardous germs from one surface to another. \nKansas State University researchers asked 123 people to prepare a recipe using either raw ground beef or chicken, along with a ready-to-eat fruit salad. The participants did the food preparation in a kitchen set up on the campus. \nA harmless type of bacteria was placed in the raw beef and chicken in order to trace levels of meat-associated contamination spread during meal preparation. \n\"First, participants were observed frequently handling towels, including paper towels, even when not using them for drying. Towels were determined to be the most contaminated of all the contact surfaces tested,\" lead researcher and food safety specialist Jeannie Sneed said in a university news release. \nMany participants touched towels before washing their hands or used them after inadequate washing of their hands, she said. Even after they washed their hands properly, the participants reused the towels and re-contaminated their hands, according to the study in the journal Food Protection Trends . \nCloth towels can easily become contaminated with germs that can cause foodborne illnesses, the researchers said. They added that previous studies found that bacteria commonly found in raw meat and poultry grows on cloth towels stored overnight, even when they are washed and rinsed in the sink. \nWash cloth towels after using them while preparing a meal, or use paper towels and throw them away after each use, Sneed advised. \nHer team found that more than 90 percent of the fruit salads prepared by the participants were contaminated with the tracer bacteria. This shows that if the tracer had been a harmful germ such as salmonella, there was a high risk of foodborne illness. \nFour out of five participants also left raw meat contamination on the sink faucet, refrigerator, oven and trash container, the study found. \nMoreover, many participants used cellphones during meal preparation and didn't clean them properly. \n\"We often take our cellphones and tablets into the kitchen,\" Sneed said, \"but what about all the other places we take them? Think of how many times you see someone talking on their cellphone in places like the bathroom, where microorganisms such as norovirus and E. coli are commonly found.\" \nIf these devices are used in the kitchen, Sneed recommended wiping their surfaces with a disinfectant. \nMore information \nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about food safety .

Ellen Seidman \nThere's a song on replay in my head. It's not a popular, make-you-want-to-jump-up-and-dance song like \" Uptown Funk .\" It's not some tune with a catchy hook like \" All About That Bass .\" No, the song on replay in my head is an absolutely depressing song from the seventies. I blame Saturday Night Live , for starters. \nMy husband and I watched the SNL 40th Anniversary Special over the weekend. Right after, we decided to check out the show's first episode. Musical guest star Janis Ian sang her 1975 hit At Seventeen , a song about an adolescent ugly duckling. It contains upbeat lyrics such as \"To those of us who knew the pain, of valentines that never came, and those whose names were never called when choosing sides for basketball.\" I recalled the song from childhood. My husband had fallen asleep and as I listened, I got a little weepy lying there in the dark. \nNot the sort of song you'd wake up revved to hear, eh? Oh, but it was. I jumped out of bed and watched the YouTube video several times in a row. \"Ugh, what is that?\" asked my 10-year-old. \"It sounds sad.\" I acknowledged that, indeed, it was. Then I listened to it again. Then I sang it in the shower. Then I hummed it to myself on my commute to work. At one point, I actually sang bits of it out loud on a New York City subway, because that's exactly the sort of thing you can do on a New York City subway. Luckily, I was able to repress the urge to belt it out during an office meeting. \nWhat was going on?! Actually, I discovered, there's a word for songs that get into your head and won't leave: earworms. As neuroscientist and musician Daniel Levitin, PhD, has noted in a podcast , the songs \"tend to be simple melodically and rhythmically\u2026the kinds of songs that the popular radio stations play and overplay.\" Which would explain why, say, \"Who Let The Dogs Out\" might infest your mind (it's one of the top-ranked earworms), but not some angst-ridden teen ballad. \nLady Gaga tunes commonly get stuck in people's heads , finds research in the journal Applied Cognitive Science .

Rozalynn S. Frazier October 11, 2017 \nNew to running, or just trying to get back into it after a hiatus? Great. It\u2019s one of the easiest sports to take up\u2014all you need is a great pair of kicks and a sports bra, and you\u2019re ready to go. Plus making your way through miles can help you shed pounds, bust stress, and even lower your risk of getting certain cancers . \nBefore you head out the door at full speed, though\u2014which will almost certainly leave you injured\u2014consider this: \u201cRunning is really hard on your body and you just have to be smart about it,\u201d says John Hancock Elite Ambassador Blake Russell, an Olympic marathoner, physical therapist, and owner of On Track Physical Therapy in Pacific Grove, California. \u201cThe key is just starting out really slow.\u201d \nHere Russell and her fellow John Hancock Elite Ambassador Bill Rodgers, a four-time Boston Marathon winner, offer five tips for helping newbies run strong and long. Stick to soft surfaces \nWhile there is nothing wrong with pounding the pavement, it can be harsh on the body, especially if yours isn\u2019t used to the movement or surface. Russell\u2019s rec: start off on softer surfaces (think grass, sand, or even the treadmill). While a softer surface doesn\u2019t automatically equal injury-free, a small study in the journal Research in Sports Medicine revealed that running on grass , for instance, puts less pressure on the foot compared to running on concrete. \nRELATED: 13 Causes of Leg Cramps and How to Stop Them Give yourself time to build muscle \n\"It takes the body at least six weeks to build muscle,\u201d says Russell, \u201cso give your body time to build that muscle.\u201d In other words, don\u2019t take on too much mileage too soon; that\u2019s a surefire way to end up sidelined . To help your body adapt, and shore up those muscles, consider strengthening exercises, such as planks, clamshells, side squats. (See how to do them here .) Try the run-walk method \nCan\u2019t make it through your miles without stopping? That\u2019s OK. While you are building your endurance (or if you just need a break mid-run), there is nothing wrong with a little walking. Rodgers suggests trying the run-walk method, which is running for a set amount of time, walking for a set amount of time, and then repeating the cycle. We recover when we walk, notes Rodgers, who believes that the 5K is an ideal running distance and that our bodies were made to run around three miles.

Register here !) \nFor more fitness tips, sign up for the HEALTH newsletter Don\u2019t run everyday \nDon\u2019t be afraid to slip off those sneaks. \u201cTake some days off if you are new to it, don\u2019t feel you have to run seven days a week,\u201d says Russell. When you exercise, you are basically causing trauma to the body by creating micro tears in the muscle. Days off allow the body to recover and those muscles to grow back stronger. And don\u2019t skimp on recovery \nAccording to Russell, recovery is just as important as training. What you do when you\u2019re off your feet will surely help you make strides while you\u2019re on \u2018em. Great practices to employ in your recovery routine: stretching, foam rolling, and massages. This, along with strength moves, will keep your body and joints loose and strong, she notes. And don\u2019t forget to refuel \u2014a 3-to-1 ratio of carbs to protein (think apple with peanut butter) within an hour of finishing your run helps replenish your energy so you can recover faster.

Plenty of women experience hair fall-out due to genetics, environmental factors, and even the way in which they style their hair. So\u2014you're not alone! Along with expert global stylists from haircare brand \u00c9prouvage , we brainstormed the most common things we do every day that lead to breakage, and a ton of easy alternatives for each one. Consider your bad habits officially broken. Bad habit: You always part your hair in the same place. \n\nQuick fix: This will cause hair loss or weakness at the part line, or even recession. Our hairline can be a very weak area, so repetitive stresses like constant brushing or even running fingers through the hair in the same place can be detrimental. Donnie Vasey, a global stylist for \u00c9prouvage suggests, \"Begin to wear your hair parted one way, until that first 'bad hair day.' When it's greasy, limp, or you're just not feeling it\u2014flip your part and add add \u00c9prouvage Thickening & Plumping Spray ($18; ulta.com ) to your normal hair-care routine. You will find a whole new world of volume and body, and won't get as much breakage or fall out.\" Say goodbye to pesky fly-aways! Bad habit: You wear your hair in a ponytail at the gym. \n\nQuick fix: Yes, ponytails are quick and easy, but can often cause more harm than good. \u00c9prouvage global stylist Anna Lylesexplains, \"Take a few more seconds to put your hair into a loose braid and tie off at the end with an Emi Jay Hair Tie ($11; emijay.com ), rather than wearing a super-tight pony.\" The loose style and soft, stretchy elastic will significantly reduce pulling at the hair follicle, which causes unnecessary hair loss. Bad habit: You hold the blow dryer too close to the brush when blow-drying your hair. \n\nQuick fix: Always keep your hairdryer an inch or two away from your hair and the brush. The tension, along with heat from the dryer, causes weak hairs to break and fall out. \u00c9prouvage global stylist Sam Lavella describes the proper steps: \"Begin blow-drying your hair using your fingers, and direct the air flow from your scalp out through your ends until it's about 80 percent dry. Then, you can bring styling brushes into play, but be sure to the dryer far enough away to prevent damage.\" Additionally, it's important to apply a protectant spray beforehand\u2014try Shu Uemura Blow Dry Multi-Tasking Primer ($33; shuuemuraartofhair-usa.com )\u2014and strengthen your hair overtime by adding K\u00e9rastase Fusio-Dose ($18, kerastase-usa.com ), which offers a tailor-made solution based on your hair concerns, to your weekly haircare regimen.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hallie gould", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "k\u00e9rastase fusio-dose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donnie vasey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna lylesexplains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam lavella", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "emi jay hair tie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u00e9prouvage thickening & plumping spray", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T06:46:25.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9bb12b89a783af237e825bf16dad311c4e5dcf2b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjhGMEq8RYRG6QWR9DwkkzPWA_MQOjvRonjiYaXX3Q03d11hBWOW8itGxlmDzPiyO6ZjDIfTJlOVFHK82N.RsWhc-", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.southernliving.com/SouthernLiving/latest", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Southern Living | Editor's Picks", "title": "How Long Does It Really Take to Fix Fried Hair?", "title_full": "How Long Does It Really Take to Fix Fried Hair?", "published": "2017-10-12T05:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img1.southernliving.timeinc.net/sites/default/files/styles/story_card_hero/public/gettyimages-530018381_0.jpg?itok=vNo6t7az", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 2290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 174, "comments": 0, "shares": 174}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 9}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9bb12b89a783af237e825bf16dad311c4e5dcf2b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjhGMEq8RYRG6QWR9DwkkzPWA_MQOjvRonjiYaXX3Q03d11hBWOW8itGxlmDzPiyO6ZjDIfTJlOVFHK82N.RsWhc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Southern Living", "published": "2017-10-12T05:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Long Does It Really Take to Fix Fried Hair?", "text": "How Long Does It Really Take to Fix Fried Hair? Getty Images A girl has GOT to know. Victoria Moorhouse, InStyle.com/MIMI \nThe other day, my friend sent me a picture of the glorious hair of my youth, and in less dramatic terms, that means a snap of my hair about three years ago before it had been touched by a drop of bleach or exposed to excessive heat styling. God, I love my curling iron. #SorrySometimesSorry. \nMy hair is in relatively good condition, I\u2019m proud to say, but it\u2019s not at peak healthiness. It\u2019s a little dry, which means it falls a little flat and the ends seem rather frayed. And while a quick trim could help, I know it wouldn\u2019t solve all my probs. \nQuite frankly, my strands need to be revitalized and nourished, and there's no way I can avoid it. All this thinking about how my \u2018do used to look before obsessing over highlights made me start to wonder how long it really takes to revive fried hair and, well, if it\u2019s even possible. Am I just a conditioning mask away, or is it going to be like, six months before I see another good hair day? So let\u2019s start with rebuilding my mane after heat styling. \nAccording to Lucie Ducrot, Hair Designer at the Julien Farel Restore Salon and Spa , fixing the sitch all depends on the extent of the damage and the elasticity of the hair. \"Once the hair is fried, it loses natural moisture and elasticity and sometimes the best solution is to stop the damage, grow out your hair, and cut off the damaged hair,\u201d she notes. \nBut if it can be saved, you might want to invest in a hair treatment, or at the very least, an extremely rich shampoo and conditioner. There are plenty of masks and oil out there that we swear by\u2014Roxanne lives for Arya Essentials Hair Oil ($68; aryaessentials.com ), while I\u2019ve got a thing for the Kevin Murphy Restore Line . \nHowever, Lucie recommends Restore ($39; julienfarel.com ), which is an anti-aging treatment that is meant to target the lengths of your hair, along with your scalp. \"It\u2019s a non-foaming creamy hair formula that gives instant shine, smoothness, and moisture to the hair and make it infinitely more manageable,\u201d she says. \nJudy McGuinness, a senior stylist at mizu New York , also says that you should opt for protein treatments, so you can add the keratin and lipids back into your hair. However, she advises you let a professional handle the protein treatment, as it can have adverse effects on your hair if you leave it on too long. Eeeek. Not playing around with that! \nIf your hair isn\u2019t too damaged, Judy says you might see results after the first treatment. If things are a bit more serious, it might take two to three months of bi-weekly treatments, along with conservative heat styling. AKA grab hold of that heat protectant, kids\u2014and don't let go. What about intense damage from too much coloring? \nThere\u2019s some good news and some bad news. First, Judy tells us that there\u2019s pretty much no getting it back to its natural, virgin state, unless you cut it off. So, you can get there, but you\u2019ll have to part with some length. \"This is why it's so important to consult with your hairstylist to make sure that they're interested in maintaining the integrity of your hair,\u201d she tells us. \"If they tell you you can go from dark brunette to platinum in one day\u2014run away! Thankfully, products like Olaplex are amazing at preventing breakage in the first place as well. Do your research and have realistic expectations as to what your hair can do, as prevention will be the key to keeping your hair healthy,\u201d she explains. \nYou\u2019ll also want to make sure you\u2019re using products that work to repair after over-processing. \nWhile it's going to be really hard for me to give up even an inch of my hair, I'm starting to think a haircut (and a shower with a 10-minute hair mask) is in my very near future. You don't know how convincing the thought of a good hair day is... or maybe you do. \nThis article originally appeared on InStyle.com/MIMI.

These 6 are among the biggest offenders tricking you into thinking you're hungry when you really aren't. Cooking shows \nThere may be a downside to turning to TV for recipe inspiration. A new study found that people who cook from scratch based on recipes they got off a cooking show weighed 11 pounds more than those who watched these shows but didn\u2019t cook very often. The authors of the study , from Cornell University\u2019s Food and Brand Lab, think the extra pounds might have to do with how indulgent TV recipes are. When people make them at home and consume them, they think it's okay to take in all the extra calories. Orange- and red-colored foods \nFrom a biological perspective, humans \u201ctend to seek out vibrant colored foods, as these contain the most vitamins and minerals,\u201d says Susan Albers, PsyD, clinical psychologist at the Cleveland Clinic and author of 50 More Ways to Soothe Yourself Without Food . \u201cThe response is subconscious\u2026think about a time when you've walked through a grocery store and found yourself picking up a sack of oranges or bag of red peppers.\u201d But that instinct works against you when you're face to face with a plate of mac and cheese or gooey nachos. These dishes share a similar hue as oranges do, but they have way more fat and calories. Food packages on your kitchen counter \nYou know the saying, out of sight is out of mind? That definitely applies to food as well, and it sums up the dangers of not putting your groceries away as soon as you come back from the supermarket or leaving out half-eaten boxes of takeout pizza. When you see these items, even in their containers, your appetite gets going, and it\u2019s hard to resist consuming them. \n\u201cPeople tend to reach automatically for foods that are within arm\u2019s reach,\u201d Dr. Albers says. \u201cIf it\u2019s there, you\u2019re likely to eat it.\u201d One study shows that people who keep soda and cereal on their counters weigh a startling 26 pounds more than those who opt to tuck them away in a pantry. Other people eating near you \nYou\u2019re having drinks with friends when someone orders a round of apps. You weren\u2019t hungry at all before the order was placed, so why did you dig in when the food arrived at the table? We automatically match the pace at which people around us eat and \u201cmirror\u201d their behavior, Dr. Albers explains, and that\u2019s true even if they\u2019re at another table and you don\u2019t know them. You could also blame a little social anxiety. \u201cWe\u2019re simply trying to fit in and make a situation more comfortable,\u201d she adds. Large plates \nIf you\u2019re served a heaping pile of food on a large plate, you\u2019ll likely try to finish it, even after you\u2019re already full. \u201cWe naturally eat more off of large plates and bowls,\u201d says Dr. Albers. It\u2019s a mean trick your eyes play on you. Larger plates cause us to think a serving of food is smaller than it actually appears. One study showed that people scarfed down 16% more cereal than usual when it was served to them in a bigger bowl. A happy mood \nYou know about stress eating: tough day of work = pint of ice cream. But it's not just negative emotions that lead us to dive into our kitchens. Positive emotions like joy, excitement, and even love can crank your appetite as well. It has to do with the fact that certain foods, like chocolate, trigger satisfying neurochemical responses in the brain. \u201cWe want to hold onto [those happy emotions], and another creamy bar of chocolate or crispy bag of chips promises to keep the good feelings rolling,\u201d says Dr. Albers. \nAlso, when life is going well and you feel good, you\u2019re more relaxed and less vigilant about your calorie intake. \u201cPeople actually eat more when they\u2019re in a happy relationship,\u201d Dr. Albers notes.

Lindsey Murray \nMost of us think of germs as \u00e2\u0080\u0098dirty\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0094and dangerous. But as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably heard, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re crawling with bugs, and these microbes are crucial for digestion, skin health, and immunity. People now know to take it easy on antibiotics and eat lots of fermented foods, but our squeaky-clean lifestyle is still a big problem, says Robynne Chutkan, MD, the\u00c2 founder of the Digestive Center for Women in Chevy Chase, Maryland, and author of The Microbiome Solution ($16, amazon.com ). \u00c2 \nWhy? Regular contact with dirt and grime teaches your microbiome how to recognize friendly germs versus foes, Dr. Chutkan explains. She gave us some tips for swapping out our super clean lifestyle for one that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s filled with more bugs. First things first, what's wrong with soap? \nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a role for the occasional bar of soap when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re particularly grubby, but a mild soap made from organic ingredients, rather than anti-bacterial soaps that are often full of harsh chemicals, is definitely the way to go. By scouring ourselves in the shower every day, we are actually stripping our skin of bacteria that keep us acne- and eczema-free. Unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just finished a Mud Run, the only places that need daily soaping are your armpits and groin. The rest of your body does fine with a rinse\u00e2\u0080\u0094even after a sweaty workout. \nDirt doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cause disease\u00e2\u0080\u0094but repeatedly killing off the good bacteria on our skin may actually harm our immunity. Think about that the next time you swap a little bit of dirt for some body wash. What is one thing that most people do in terms of cleanliness that is unnecessary? \nHarsh hand sanitizers! Unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been hanging out on an Ebola ward, the vast majority of microbes on your skin and hands are not virulent germs that cause serious infection; they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re harmless bacteria that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt you. Even during cold and flu season? \nYes, you should take a bit more precaution when your co-workers are coughing and sneezing non-stop. But you still don't need anti-bacterial soaps and cleansers; those work against bacteria, and the common cold and flu is caused by a virus. All that's necessary during cold and flu season is regularly washing hands with all-natural soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. This dislodges viruses and bacteria, so they wash down the drain, whereas antibacterial soaps expose you to antibiotics you don't need in your life. What are some other ways we can \u00e2\u0080\u009clive dirty\u00e2\u0080\u009d in our everyday lives? \nLike I said before, rinse with just water in the tub or shower, and skip the antibacterial soaps and shampoos. Also, spending just one day on a farm can better your microbiome. So volunteer at a community garden, or simply sit in the grass at the park. Even little things can do a lot over time. Open a window in your house or car to let some good microbes in. Buy food from the farmer's market that you know is grown in real soil, rather than produced in a factory. Try to keep in mind that in general, soil-derived microbes are good! \nThis interview has been edited and condensed.

While signs of physical assault can be evident, these other behaviors are likely to go under the radar. \nOctober is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, so we\u2019ve asked experts to tell us how to recognize that what might seem like a toxic or difficult relationship a friend is in is something more serious\u2014and then help her find safety before the abuse escalates. \nRELATED: 5 Signs You\u2019re in an Emotionally Abusive Relationship Recognize the signs \nA bruised leg, a black eye\u2014physical signs of harm like this can be caused by one-time accidents. But if you repeatedly notice visible symptoms of injury, consider them red flags. You might be wrong\u2014your friend really could be accident prone or suffer a string of gym-related mishaps. But it's worth the risk to follow up. \nUnfortunately, signs of emotional or sexual abuse aren't always obvious. So pay attention to a loved one's actions. \u201cThere are certain types of body language or little cues you can pick up on that might indicate that a victim is fearful of their partner ,\u201d says David B. Wexler, PhD, author of When Good Men Behave Badly and executive director of the Relationship Training Institute in San Diego. You might also notice your friend going to great lengths to keep her partner happy , or blowing off plans with sketchy excuses. \u201cThis is often an indicator the abuser is being excessively demanding of their partner\u2019s attention,\u201d explains Wexler. \nRELATED: 10 Things to Say (and Not to Say) To Someone Who\u2019s Depressed \nIf she's bombarded by texts and calls from her boo when they're apart, tune in. \u201cI\u2019ve met with survivors who receive multiple calls and texts from their partner just while they\u2019re sitting in my office ,\u201d says Jimmy Meagher, director of the Domestic Violence and Empowerment Initiative at Safe Horizon, the nation\u2019s leading victim assistance. If she has to repeatedly check in with her partner, that could be a tip-off that her significant other is tracking her behavior in an unhealthy way. \nAnd keep an eye out for how your friend and her partner interact. \u201cIf someone is very controlling, they\u2019ll hover almost in a stalking fashion,\u201d says Wexler. \u201cA man might show up without warning when his partner gets off work not because he\u2019s a nice guy, but because he wants her to know she can\u2019t linger or hang out with coworkers. That extra level of vigilance is another sign.\u201d \nWATCH THE VIDEO: 5 Things People Get Wrong About Depression Broach the subject \n\u201cIf you suspect a friend or family member is being abused, talk to them at a safe time and place, away from their partner or anybody else who could overhear and potentially compromise their safety,\u201d advises Meagher. Arrange to meet up for coffee after work, for example, or plan an evening jog or fro-yo run that's just the two of you. \nWhen you bring up your concerns, use \u201cI\u201d statements instead of sentences filled with \u201cyou,\u201d which will make her less likely to feel blamed or attacked and then react defensively. For example, \"I notice Sam has been calling and texting you all night and I\u2019m concerned about that. Is everything okay?\" You're not accusing her partner of anything; just voicing your observations. \n\u201cIt\u2019s helpful to ask questions that start to paint a picture for them that something isn\u2019t right,\u201d adds Wexler. \u201cMaybe you say something like, \u2018I\u2019m wondering how the kids are reacting to what\u2019s going on in your house .\u2019 These are ways to supportively indicate concern that actually help the victim come to some of their own realizations about what is going on.\u201d You want to be calm and direct, not accusatory or overly emotional, so she feels like she can confide in you. \nRELATED: 12 Ways Your Relationship Can Hurt Your Health Listen and don't judge \nIt\u2019s natural to want to immediately step in if you think a loved one might be involved with an abuser. But telling your friend how to handle the situation or asserting that you're going to call authorities won\u2019t necessarily help. \u201cSurvivors are the experts in their own safety,\u201d says Meagher. \u201cThey know their abusers best and they know what has worked to keep them safe in the past and what hasn\u2019t.\u201d \nIf they do share that they have experienced abuse, validate what they are saying and how they are feeling. Avoid \"you need tos,\" \"you have tos,\" and \"you shoulds.\" This language can actually make victims feel even more disempowered. Plus, you could come off as judgy\u2014behavior no one responds well to. \n\u201cI would voice concern in a non-judgemental way and normalize their experience by saying something like, \u2018I think anybody who has experience X would feel similar to how you\u2019re feeling right now,\u2019\u201d suggests Meagher. Remind her that you are there for her and willing to do whatever she wants you to do to help her get out of the relationship or find safety. \nTo get more relationship advice, sign up for the HEALTH newsletter Offer to help\u2014but accept limitations \nAbusive behavior tends to spike around the time a victim tries to leave a relationship, so victims may be especially in need of support if they decide to end it. What can you do to make sure she's safe and out of harm's way once she leaves? \nDo your homework and gather information on local resources such as shelters, hotlines, and counseling centers, suggests Meagher. \u201cYou can also escort or accompany them to a clinic, police station, or court, if that\u2019s what they want to do,\u201d he adds. Keep a go- bag in your house so your friend can have extra clothing, toiletries, and documents on hand, should she need to get away fast. \nAnd remember this: \u201cWhile we see patterns of abuse, every relationship is unique,\u201d says Meagher. \u201cIt\u2019s always a good idea for somebody experiencing abuse to reach out to program and service providers who understand domestic violence and its complexities. We can help them make a safety plan, whether that\u2019s going to a shelter, sleeping at a friend or family member\u2019s home, or staying in the relationship.\u201d \nSafe Horizon's free and confidential domestic violence hotline is a good place to start: 1-800-621-4673.

Here's What Causes Amnesia in Young People", "text": "Email Broadimage/REX/Shutterstock \nOn Monday\u2019s episode of Dancing with the Stars , actor Frankie Muniz shared a personal health tidbit in a pre-taped segment: He\u2019s struggling with serious memory loss . Muniz revealed there are entire years he can\u2019t recall, including his entire stint on Malcolm in the Middle . \n\u201cIt\u2019s something that I never really wanted to talk about, because I\u2019m just me and this is my life,\u201d he told People after his performance. \u201cBut we were talking about Malcolm [ in the Middle ] and how it started, and I don\u2019t really have memories of being on the show.\u201d \nAlarmingly, his doctors haven\u2019t quite figured out what\u2019s causing this amnesia. \u201cEvery time I go to the doctors they just tell me I\u2019m crazy,\u201d he said. \nMemory loss is a relatively common health concern for older folks. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that 12.5% of adults ages 45 and over feel like their memory is slipping. A little forgetfulness is unavoidable as we age, but Muniz is just 31 years old. \n\u201cMemory loss can happen as part of healthy aging above the age of 65 due to some shrinkage that happens in the brain as we get older,\u201d says Rawan Tarawneh, MD, assistant professor of neurology at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. \u201cBut any loss of memory in someone in their 30s is concerning. There\u2019s an underlying cause\u2014we cannot attribute that to a normal biological processes.\u201d \nRELATED VIDEO: Frankie Muniz\u2019s Secret Health Battle: How He Survived a Racing Accident & Mysterious Mini-Strokes \nWe can\u2019t be sure what exactly is behind Muniz\u2019s memory loss. But some causes do strike people in his age range. First, Dr. Tarawneh suggests ruling out autoimmune diseases like Hashimoto\u2019s disease or Susac\u2019s syndrome, two conditions that are characterized by inflammation in the brain, which could damage memory, she says. \u201cInflammatory conditions may cause memory problems, seizures, and trouble with vision or hearing,\u201d Dr. Tarawneh says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to look for these diseases because they\u2019re treatable.\u201d \nYoung people may also have memory loss due to injury, whether it\u2019s a minor concussion or a more serious brain trauma, she says. Muniz admitted on DWTS that he\u2019s had nine concussions. \u201cPeople who have head injuries can have amnesia,\u201d says American Academy of Neurology fellow Gary Abrams, MD, a professor of clinical neurology at the University of California San Francisco, but they are more likely to forget events close in time to the injury. \nA history of concussions could increase a person\u2019s risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, the rare but serious degenerative brain disorder making headlines among professional football players. CTE can cause memory problems and is usually accompanied by personality and behavioral changes, says Dr. Tarawneh. \nMuniz also estimated that he\u2019s had 15 mini-strokes , or transient ischemic attacks . A mini-stroke temporarily blocks blood flow to the brain. While it doesn\u2019t usually cause long-term damage, it can be a sign someone is likely to have a full-blown stroke , which is why mini-strokes are also sometimes called warning strokes , according to the American Stroke Association. \nWhen blood flow to the brain is blocked, it can lead to a type of dementia called vascular dementia, Dr. Abrams says, but memory loss isn\u2019t always a given after a stroke. \u201cSome people can accumulate lots of mini-strokes, and that can be associated with memory loss, while other people have significant strokes and make a good recovery.\u201d \nIt\u2019s also possible that underlying mental health conditions, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, can trigger cognitive problems, Dr. Abrams says. The use of certain prescription medications, including anti-anxiety meds, antidepressants, statins, and sleeping pills, can also bring on memory loss, as can over-the-counter sleep aids and allergy meds, adds Dr. Tarawneh. \nMost importantly, a young person with memory loss shouldn\u2019t give up on getting the right diagnosis. That means completing a comprehensive neurological evaluation, which might include blood tests, brain imaging, a detailed medical history, and cognitive tests, according to Dr Abrams. \n\u201cContinue to pursue a cause and treatment,\u201d Dr. Tarawneh advises anyone who may be suffering the same mysterious memory loss Muniz is dealing with at a young age. \u201cDon\u2019t just blame it on minor things.\u201d \nThis article originally appeared on Health.com Show Full Article ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T05:25:00.357+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc1a18afa42a819cdcbc46b3d60c890d9dd34867", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjhGMEq8RYRG6i0RydGwkfYSSercnYDtead_Am.ZHKzYv", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "http://www.health.com/health/beauty-style/feed", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Beauty - Health.com", "title": "Is Stress Making Your Skin Freak Out?

More 1 of 6 Electra K. Vasileiadou/Getty Images Is stress hurting your skin? \nWhether you\u2019re overloaded at work or dealing with the kids, ongoing stress takes a toll on your complexion. It triggers adrenal glands to amp up cortisol production, which over time can cause skin inflammation. And during crazy stretches, you\u2019re less likely to eat or sleep well, which doesn\u2019t help. External stress from the environment is another culprit. Luckily, there are simple solutions. Advertisement 2 of 6 michaeljung/Getty Images For dryness \nChronically high levels of cortisol can dehydrate your skin, explains Mona Gohara, MD, associate clinical professor of dermatology at Yale School of Medicine. External elements (like cold, dry air) can further break down the skin barrier, making it easier for your skin\u2019s natural moisture to escape, adds Chicago dermatologist Jordan Carqueville, MD. \nFast fix: Two words: hyaluronic acid . The powerhouse ingredient attracts moisture to the skin\u2014it can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water\u2014instantly hydrating and plumping your complexion, says Dr. Gohara. She suggests using a hyaluronic acid\u2013based serum, which typically has a higher concentration than a moisturizer. Try Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum ($20; target.com ). \nLong-term plan: The more intact your skin barrier is, the less moisture is able to escape. To strengthen it, use a moisturizer with ceramides, lipid molecules that are an essential component of the skin barrier. Try Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Lift & Firm Night Cream ($78; macys.com ). 3 of 6 Courtesy of Manufacturer For sallow skin \nWhen your body is pumping out cortisol, it\u2019s in a fight-or-flight state, says Dr. Gohara. Blood flow to your muscles increases, with less blood going to your skin, leaving it dull. Also to blame: pollution, which causes free radicals that make skin look uneven. \nFast fix: \u201cFacial massage stimulates lymphatic drainage and increases circulation, the best antidote for a dull complexion,\u201d says Dr. Gohara. You can also try the Clarisonic Smart Pro le Uplift ($349; sephora.com ). It has interchangeable cleansing and massaging heads, which can remove pollution particles better than manual face washing. \nLong-term plan: Consider microdermabrasion. \u201cThe tip of the machine bu s o dead cells, and the suction leaves skin radiant,\u201d says Dr. Gohara, who advises getting a treatment every three months. Adding vitamin C to your routine is also a smart move; the antioxidant counteracts free radicals and fades existing spots. Find it in Joanna Vargas Rescue Serum ($150; dermstore.com ). Advertisement 4 of 6 Wavebreakmedia/Getty Images For breakouts \nCortisol both increases inflammation and stimulates oil production. This dreaded combo can exacerbate existing acne and cause breakouts in someone with otherwise clear skin, says Dr. Carqueville. (Hence that massive zit that often crops up at the least opportune time, like right before a job interview.) On the environmental side, smog and particulate matter can clog pores, causing spots. \nFast fix: A visit to the dermatologist for a steroid injection is the quickest way to knock out a big honker. The next-best thing, says Dr. Carqueville, is a spot treatment with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. Try the mess-free Oxy On-the-Go Acne Stick ($6; target.com ). \nLong-term plan: \u201cFoods high on the glycemic index cause insulin spikes that lead to excess sebum production,\u201d explains Dr. Carqueville. Translation: Ditching refined carbs may help keep your complexion clear. Advertisement 5 of 6 Courtesy of Manufacturer For redness \nCortisol can dilate blood vessels, leading to temporary flushing. It\u2019s also related to more chronic conditions, like rosacea, which causes persistent redness of the skin on the nose and across the cheeks, says Elizabeth K. Hale, MD, clinical associate professor of dermatology at NYU Langone Medical Center. And increased cortisol can exacerbate other diseases that cause red, irritated skin, like eczema and psoriasis . \nFast fix: Skin-soothing botanicals, such as cucumber, can help temporarily bring down redness, says Dr. Carqueville. Try a mask like SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque ($57; dermstore.com ). Dr. Gohara also likes spray-on mineral waters with the anti-inflammatory mineral selenium. Her pick: La Roche-Posay Thermal Spring Water ($13; dermstore.com ). \nLong-term plan: For chronic conditions like rosacea, see a derm, who may prescribe a combo of oral antibiotics and topicals, says Dr. Hale. The topical medications Mirvaso and Rhofade work by constricting blood vessels to tamp down redness. Advertisement 6 of 6 Courtesy of Manufacturer For accelerated aging \n\u201cPeople carry stress in their brows and end up with \u201811\u2019 lines ,\u201d says Dr. Hale. Not to mention, chronic skin inflammation can break down collagen and elastin, as does exposure to sun and pollution. \nFast fix: An injectable neuromodulator, like Botox or Dysport, will relax those lines between your brows, says Dr. Hale. If you don\u2019t want to get jabbed, resurfacing lasers or chemical peels can quickly refresh the skin as well as stimulate collagen production. \nLong-term plan: SPF plus antioxidant plus retinoid. Retinoids (stick to nightly use) remain the gold-standard anti-ager; the vitamin A derivatives are proven to boost cell turnover. Try this trio: Hampton Sun Age-Defying SPF 50 Mineral Cre\u0300me ($52; neimanmarcus.com ), PCA Skin C-Quench Antioxidant Serum ($75; dermstore.com ), and First Aid Beauty Fab Skin Lab Retinol Serum ($58; dermstore.com ). Also important: Daily sun protection is a must to safeguard your skin from aging and skin cancer. A topical antioxidant neutralizes free radicals caused by UV rays and pollution, says Dr. Hale, who suggests applying one morning and night.

Maria Masters October 12, 2017 \nIf the string of hurricanes that recently battered the Atlantic coast seemed like an anomaly, that\u2019s because it was: According to the National Hurricane Center, September 2017 was the most active tropical storm month on record, ushering in flooding of homes and buildings from Texas to Puerto Rico. \nIf your home was damaged by floodwaters, you\u2019ll need to take quick action to dry out your furniture, carpeting, and walls. Too much moisture and standing water can be a breeding ground for mold, which could trigger breathing problems or contribute to an infection. But even if your home hasn\u2019t been damaged in a hurricane or flood, you likely still have mold in your house. \nIn fact, mold is everywhere . Even in the cleanest of homes, it\u2019s impossible to eliminate entirely. Every time you open a window or go outside, mold can be ushered in through the air or by attaching itself to your clothing and shoes. Once indoors, it can grow in the walls, carpeting, upholstery, and more. Truth is, mold is good at reproducing anywhere there is moisture; mold has existed for millions of years and has picked up a few survival tricks along the way. Health symptoms that can be caused by mold in your house \nMold doesn\u2019t bother everyone. In fact, out of thousands of mold species, only a few dozen will trigger any health problems at all, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Still, some of us are sensitive to molds. People who are allergic to an indoor mold can experience year-round symptoms like a sore throat, cough, stuffy nose, and more; for those who also have asthma , mold can trigger an asthma attack. People with a weakened immune system or a chronic lung condition like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can develop a serious infection in the lungs if they\u2019re exposed to mold. \nPeople without allergies and asthma aren\u2019t immune to the effects: In 2004, the Institute of Medicine concluded that people without pre-existing lung conditions can also experience symptoms like nasal congestion and a sore throat if they live in a house with damp floors or moisture accumulation. \nRELATED: 25 Ways to Allergy-Proof Your Home What mold looks like \nMolds are a type of fungus and can look like their fungal cousins, mushrooms and yeasts. Outdoors, molds can be seen gobbling up the dead organic matter on decomposing surfaces like fallen leaves and rotting logs; indoors, house mold thrives in wet, humid environments like bathrooms and basements or anywhere that has recently flooded. There are thousands of types of mold, and their appearance can vary depending on the type of mold and where it\u2019s growing. \nThe most common indoor molds are Cladosporium , Penicillium , Aspergillus , and Alternaria , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Black mold, or Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra ), is also sometimes found in homes and other buildings. This greenish-black growth can grow on fiberboard, paper, dust, and lint, particularly in areas that may have recently flooded or suffered other types of water damage. While black mold can certainly look scary, the CDC says that Stachybotrys chartarum isn\u2019t any more harmful than other types of mold. \nRELATED: 11 Unexpected Places Mold May Be Hiding in Your Home What mold smells like \nMold has a damp, musty scent\u2014similar to what you\u2019d smell after opening an old book. \u201cIn general, smell is not a good way to determine if there is a mold problem,\u201d says Laureen Burton, a staff chemist and toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The smell of indoor molds can differ depending on the type of mold, the surface on which it\u2019s growing, and its source of moisture. Plus, she says, some people don\u2019t notice a smell at all. \nThe mold smell is caused by microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs), which are substances that are naturally produced by molds as they grow. \u201cThe health effects of inhaling mVOCs are largely unknown,\u201d says Burton, \u201calthough exposure to some mVOCs has been linked to symptoms such as headaches , nasal irritation, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea.\u201d How to test for mold \nYou probably don\u2019t need to do mold testing or buy a mold test kit, especially if the fungus is visible. Because the health effects of mold vary from person to person, the CDC says that if you can see it or smell it, it should be removed, no matter what type of mold is in your home. \nWhile it\u2019s not possible to completely eliminate mold in your house, you can prevent a build-up by cleaning up any wet or damp spots and fixing any existing water leaks. (All molds need water to live; they reproduce by releasing spores, or microscopic \u201cseeds,\u201d into the air that grow if they land on a damp surface.) \nNeither the CDC nor the EPA recommends doing routine mold samplings\u2014both organizations point out that there are no federal limits for mold in buildings, so people can\u2019t check their apartment complex\u2019s compliance with the law, for example. Plus, the testing can be expensive. \nTo get our top stories delivered to your inbox, sign up for the HEALTH newsletter When you need to call an expert to eradicate mold \nIf the moldy area is small\u2014it\u2019s growing in an area that\u2019s smaller than 3 feet by 3 feet\u2014you can probably do a DIY cleanup. The CDC recommends wearing an N-95 respirator (found in hardware stores) and protective eyewear and gloves while handling mold. After you\u2019ve fixed any plumbing leaks and cleaned up the water, you can scrub off the mold with a bleach solution made from no more than 1 cup of laundry bleach in 1 gallon of water. \nIf the water-damaged or moldy area is larger than 3 feet by 3 feet, you could also call in a professional. As there are no federal mold regulations, the CDC recommends finding a specialist who\u2019s affiliated with or certified by the National Environmental Health Association, the American Industrial Hygiene Association, the Institute of Inspection, Cleaning, and Restoration Certification, or the American Council for Accredited Certification. If you don\u2019t see or smell mold but suspect it\u2019s hidden\u2014you know there has been water damage behind a wall or beneath a floor, for example\u2014an experienced professional can also help find the source.

My skin, for one. 10/12/2017 02:39 pm ET Updated 3 days ago \nBy Amanda Norcross \nThis writer is part of Health.com\u2019s contributor network. Learn more about the contributor network and how to join . \nI like ice cream and cheese \u2014 a lot. Sadly, I\u2019m also lactose intolerant. I was diagnosed at age 17, after a bout of severe stomach pain landed me in the emergency room. But despite the diagnosis, I was never able to completely give up dairy. Instead, I managed my symptoms by taking Lactaid pills and consuming dairy in small amounts (well, usually). For the most part, a little skim milk or butter here and there hadn\u2019t affected me too much. \nBut after a recent string of stomach cramps and bloating left me feeling awful, I started to wonder if omitting dairy from my diet might actually be a good idea. After all, elimination diets are all the rage, and other people claimed to have success with them. Supposedly, not only did people feel better after cutting out dairy, but many of them also noticed improved complexions and a thinner waistline. \nSo I decided to give up dairy for an entire month: yogurt, coffee creamer, pizza, everything. I admit I was hoping for a big change, but it wasn\u2019t exactly what I expected. \nRELATED: Here\u2019s What Happened When I Cut Out Alcohol and Sweets for 40 Days \nWeek 1 \nI planned out my meals and stocked up on dairy-free groceries. That part was easy. What wasn\u2019t easy was the realization that while many restaurants have vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options, it was a lot harder to eat out on a dairy-free diet. When I asked servers which meals contained dairy, they\u2019d usually have to check with the chef, since nothing was labeled that way on the menu. And inevitably, most items would be prepared with at least a little butter. \nAs a result, within a day or two of giving up dairy, I found myself loading up on carbs. I tried to choose whole grains, but I was also snacking on more chips than usual. I think I was compensating for the fact that many of everyday diet staples, such as Greek yogurt, were now off the table \u2014 and I admittedly wasn\u2019t as excited to replace those foods with veggies. \nWeek 2 \nI felt good. My stomach aches had started to go away, and I was also less bloated. I figured out dairy-free substitutions for many of my go-to meals, such as peanut butter instead of butter on toast, almond milk instead of half-and-half in coffee, avocado instead of mayo on my sandwich. (Later, I discovered that mayo is dairy-free \u2014 mind blown.) My husband and I wouldn\u2019t always cook with dairy prior to my experiment, so I didn\u2019t notice much of a difference at dinnertime, but I did miss shredded cheese on taco night. Tacos are not the same without cheese, in case you were wondering. Tacos are not the same without cheese, in case you were wondering. \nWeek 3 \nBy this time, I had a handle on which foods were dairy-free, and I started getting a little more adventurous with my meals. I even made a dairy-free mug dessert , which has since become my go-to whenever I\u2019m craving something sweet. I also noticed that my diet had become more balanced than when I first started the experiment, and I was consciously trying to replace dairy with healthy alternatives. \nWeek 4 \nBefore I even hit the one-month mark, I had decided to continue a mostly dairy-free diet \u2014 something I did not see coming. What really convinced me was the fact that my stomach aches had disappeared. In fact, I didn\u2019t have a single bout of nausea the entire month. I was also surprised to find I was craving fewer sweets, maybe since ice cream was off-limits. \nWhat didn\u2019t change? My skin, for one. My weight stayed exactly the same, too \u2014 I didn\u2019t lose or gain a single pound. In that sense, eliminating dairy wasn\u2019t the magic fix for everything I\u2019d heard it might be. But I did feel better. I\u2019ve even been more motivated to hit the gym \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that has anything to do with my dairy-free diet, but I\u2019ll take it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amanda norcross", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "health.com", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-14T13:26:46.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "25cd310439fa4bc794876699e0df21bbeb3f89ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjqXfVyi_rqPew5OiX6Wo4NLARs3BHHn6h_5cWv7cUGQX0ziijSxdVCs-", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Yes, \u2018Diet\u2019 Avocados Are Now a Thing\u2014Here\u2019s a Nutritionist\u2019s Take - Health", "title_full": "Yes, \u2018Diet\u2019 Avocados Are Now a Thing\u2014Here\u2019s a Nutritionist\u2019s Take - Health", "published": "2017-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.189, "main_image": "http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium_16_9/public/styles/main/public/gettyimages-649749372.jpg?itok=5vGiFWuy", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 2290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 169, "comments": 0, "shares": 169}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "25cd310439fa4bc794876699e0df21bbeb3f89ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjqXfVyi_rqPew5OiX6Wo4NLARs3BHHn6h_5cWv7cUGQX0ziijSxdVCs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cynthia Sass", "published": "2017-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Yes, \u2018Diet\u2019 Avocados Are Now a Thing\u2014Here\u2019s a Nutritionist\u2019s Take - Health", "text": "The Real Scoop on \u2018Diet\u2019 Avocados, According to a Nutritionist \u2013 Health Yes, \u2018Diet\u2019 Avocados Are Now a Thing\u2014Here\u2019s a Nutritionist\u2019s Take \nSearch", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cynthia sass", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york yankees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loma linda university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hass avocado board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isla bonita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national health and nutrition examination survey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn nets", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-14T14:07:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd231b89b4ecdb41d822e5e1bc64193dc411c00f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjqAAiJJ493ZrjSQjv9yC8dmsF5t8OLJ91zuzxNZOLMRxGpZ2PpGPALbVNBNSl35rDA--", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Quinoa Recipes: From Quinoa and Chickpea Burgers, Quinoa Ginger-Pecan Muffins, Quinoa Black Bean Salad - Health", "title_full": "Quinoa Recipes: From Quinoa and Chickpea Burgers, Quinoa Ginger-Pecan Muffins, Quinoa Black Bean Salad - Health", "published": "2017-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.048, "main_image": "http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium_16_9/public/1506714363/quinoa-4-ways-video.jpg?itok=fvMaEgoK", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd231b89b4ecdb41d822e5e1bc64193dc411c00f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjqAAiJJ493ZrjSQjv9yC8dmsF5t8OLJ91zuzxNZOLMRxGpZ2PpGPALbVNBNSl35rDA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Health.Com", "published": "2017-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Quinoa Recipes: From Quinoa and Chickpea Burgers, Quinoa Ginger-Pecan Muffins, Quinoa Black Bean Salad - Health", "text": "These Quinoa Recipes Are Packed With Protein Quinoa is rich in fiber and protein.

Cynthia Sass, MPH, RD October 11, 2017 \nIf you\u2019ve never made spaghetti squash before, there are two things you should know: It\u2019s easy, and it\u2019s kind of magical. To prep, carefully slice the oblong-shaped veggie in half, lengthwise, and scoop out the seeds. Lightly brush or rub the cut sides with olive oil. Place on a baking sheet, cut side down, and bake at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes. After you take it out of the oven, let it cool a bit. Then, with the cut side facing up, run a fork along the length of the squash from one end to the other. The flesh will come away from the outer skin in thin strands that look just like angel hair pasta. \nUsing spaghetti squash in place of traditional pasta significantly slashes your intake of calories and carbs. (Spaghetti squash is also naturally gluten-free, of course.) One cup of cooked wheat spaghetti packs about 220 calories; compare that to just 40 calories in the same size portion of spaghetti squash. The swap also saves you nearly 30 grams of carb. And perhaps best of all, spaghetti squash is a rich source of antioxidants and blood pressure-regulating, bloat-busting potassium . \nOnce your squash is cooked, there are many ways to enjoy it\u2014hot or cold, and sweet or savory\u2014any time of day. Here are five of my favorite recipes from my own kitchen. Spaghetti squash with saut\u00e9ed spinach, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and onion \nIn a medium pan over low heat, saut\u00e9 a half teaspoon of minced garlic, one quarter cup of minced yellow onion, and a half teaspoon of Italian seasoning in one tablespoon of EVOO. And a half cup of baby spinach, 10 sliced cherry tomatoes and three to four sliced white button mushrooms. Saute for four to five minutes. Add a few fresh sliced basil leaves and serve veggie mixture over one cup of spaghetti squash. For a complete meal, add a protein source, like three to four ounces of cooked salmon or chicken breast, or a half cup of cannellini beans. Spaghetti squash with almond butter-ginger-garlic sauce \nThin two tablespoons of almond butter with one and a half tablespoons of warmed veggie broth. Stir in a half teaspoon each of minced garlic and fresh grated ginger, and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Coat spaghetti squash with the almond mixture and top with a protein of your choice. \nRELATED: 28 Squash Recipes You'll Crave Year-Round Spaghetti squash lettuce boats with tahini sauce \nMix two tablespoons of tahini with one teaspoon of fresh squeezed lemon juice, one half teaspoon of minced garlic, and one eighth teaspoon each of sea salt, cayenne pepper, and ground cumin. Set aside. Spoon two tablespoons of cooked squash into each of four large outer romaine leaves. Top each lettuce boat with some protein, like an ounce of wild salmon or a few tablespoons of lentils, and drizzle with the tahini sauce. Spaghetti squash, apple butter, and fruit \nFor a sweet side or dessert, toss a half cup of spaghetti squash with a quarter cup of apple butter or pumpkin butter. Add one cup of fruit, like chopped apple or pear. Sprinkle with about 10 golden raisins and garnish with two tablespoons of toasted pumpkin seeds. \nTo get more recipes and nutrition tips, sign up for the HEALTH newsletter Spaghetti squash with maple syrup, cinnamon, ginger, and chopped pecans \nFor another sweet treat, whisk together a half tablespoon coconut oil, one teaspoon of maple syrup, and one quarter teaspoon each of ground cinnamon and fresh grated ginger. Toss a half cup spaghetti squash with the mixture and top with one quarter cup of chopped pecans. \nFor more simple ways to enjoy spaghetti squash, try these tips: Serve a breakfast omelet or scramble over a bed of spaghetti squash. Whip a half cup of strands into a fruit smoothie. For an easy side dish, toss squash strands with marinara sauce, pesto, or olive tapenade.

Rosie McCall \nIf you struggle to get the rest you (so desperately) need, imagine there was one simple thing you could do to improve the quality of your Zs. According to neurologist and sleep medicine specialist W. Chris Winter, MD, it's as simple as setting your alarm for the same time every day \u2014no matter how late you hit the hay the night before. In this excerpt from his new book The Sleep Solution ($26; amazon.com ), Dr. Winter explains how sticking to that wake-up time will eventually train your brain to doze off at a consistent time too. \nI have been asked frequently over the years the following question: \u201cWhat is the single most important piece of advice for achieving your best sleep ?\u201d To me, it\u2019s easy: pick a wake up time and stick with it! \nWhen I ask you, \u201cWhat time do you wake up in the morning?\u201d the answer should be one simple time. If your answer to that question is, \u201cI get up at 6:45 and usually go to the gym or run outside,\u201d you get a gold star. \nHowever, you probably have a problem if you answer something like this: \u201cI usually go to bed at 11:00 except on the weekends when I go out with my friends and we stay out until 2:00 or 3:00 easily. I\u2019m usually up around noon . . . no later than 2:00 p.m. on those days. On Tuesdays I try to go to bed early, like 9:00 because on Wednesday, I have to get up early for this boot camp exercise class. On those days, I go out to my car at lunch and sleep for 45 minutes. I feel pretty beat by the end of the week and often fall asleep early in the evening. If I do, I struggle to stay asleep and often have trouble falling asleep later. It\u2019s really hard to get up for work on Monday . . . I\u2019m often late. Every now and then, no more than once a month, I\u2019ll use a sick day and stay home from work so I can sleep all day . . .\u201d \nWow, I blacked out there a little bit from acute boredom during that long explanation. But I have to tell you, that was a real patient story. Optimally, an individual should have a consistent bed time and perhaps more important a consistent wake time. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t usually the case with individuals who have sleep problems . Sleep times can vary wildly in these people and they sadly do not seem to recognize that this haphazard lifestyle is a big part of their problem. In fact, they strangely often see it as working toward a solution. \nSome people are in complete control of their sleep schedule. No matter what happens in their lives, they are up at 6:00 a.m. and soon after in the gym getting their BodyPump class on. These individuals are dogs who wag their tails (the dog is in control, and it wags its tail). Other individuals get up and exercise if their evening goes perfectly to plan, but if their sleep is problematic one night, their schedule goes down the tubes. If it takes them an hour or two longer than normal to fall asleep, they ditch their exercise plans and sleep in. For these individuals, their wake time depends on their sleep quality . They are not in control, so instead of the dog wagging its tail, for these individuals, the tail wags the dog. I call them \u201cdog waggers.\u201d Their sleep schedule is dictated by their sleep successes or failures. \nHere are some examples of dog waggers: \n\u201cI went to bed early last night because I had a rough night of sleep at my girlfriend\u2019s apartment the night before.\u201d \n\u201cMy alarm went off at 6:00, but since I couldn\u2019t fall asleep until 3:00 a.m., I hit the snooze and called in to work later saying I was sick.\u201d \n\u201cMy wife was driving me crazy because I masked the basement last month but haven\u2019t painted yet, so I just did it . . . stayed up most of last night to do it. I took a huge nap when I got home from work, now I\u2019m wired.\u201d \nWhen an individual sleeps in this way, all kinds of bad things are happening. You are teaching your body to sleep only when it\u2019s exhausted . Like a cow grazing for food, you\u2019re grazing for sleep. If you are independently wealthy and have no need to work, congratulations! Maybe the schedule of the world doesn\u2019t apply to you and you can keep up your freewheeling schedule as long as you wish. For the rest of us, the world is full of appointments, deadlines and plenty of times we need to be awake. \nRELATED: 11 Alarm Clocks for Heavy Sleepers \nI joke with my patients all the time that if I can\u2019t fix their sleep problems, they should enlist in the military. The army is such a wonderful environment for sleep. They do everything sleep related perfectly. Their wake up time is precise. Fall out at 5:00 a.m. Tired? You\u2019ll get over that quickly as you and your platoon head out for physical training. Change for breakfast at exactly the same time every day. Activities, more exercise, lunch, dinner, and finally back to bed so you can get up and repeat the exact same schedule the next day. Within a few days of boot camp, you will have all sorts of wonderful and exciting problems . . . falling asleep at night will most likely not be one of them. I always think about these soldiers when a patient tells me he has trouble settling at night because his \u201c mind won\u2019t shut off .\u201d I imagine after a day of engaging in grueling exercise, being screamed at and belittled, and missing your family as you wonder what in the hell you\u2019ve gotten yourself into, you might have some thoughts racing through your mind. But still, these men and women sleep. \nSo when should you go to bed? When should you wake up? I think you see by now why we have to start with the latter. You need to select a wake time that works for your life. If you have to be at work by 9:00 and your commute is 30 minutes, getting up an hour earlier might work for you. Unless you want breakfast or maybe a shower? Unless you want to exercise or maybe you have kids who need to get up for school? The point is to pick a time that\u2019s realistic. And be sure to include time to actually feel awake. Nobody opens her eyes and feels like Mary Sunshine in the morning, at least nobody over three. So be sure to give yourself some time to go from groggy to human . \nOne more important detail: There is no such thing as a good or bad wake time. Yeah, depending on whether you are a night owl or a morning lark , one schedule might work better than another. Are you a morning person? Getting up at 6:00 might be better than noon. Always been a real night owl? That 5:30 a.m. wake time to meet some friends for a bike ride might not be ideal. Brain schedule aside, I\u2019m not here to judge. People in the South talk about sleeping in like they talk about sex: in embarrassed whispers. There is nothing wrong with being a night owl. It\u2019s not a sin. \nExcerpted from The Sleep Solution: Why Your Sleep is Broken and How to Fix It by W.

Halfway through the workout, Kleban gives you the option to add light dumbbells to the routine for a little extra burn. If you don\u2019t have three- or five-pound weights lying around, don\u2019t worry.

Find Free WordPress Themes and plugins. \nThis article originally appeared on RealSimple.com. \nParabens have been widely used in products to prevent bacteria growth since the 1950s. \u201cAbout 85 percent of cosmetics have them,\u201d says Arthur Rich, Ph.D., a cosmetic chemist in Chestnut Ridge, New York. \u201cThey\u2019re inexpensive and effective.\u201d New York City dermatologist Fran E. Cook-Bolden explains, \u201cParabens have a long history of safe use, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re commonplace. New preservatives have less of a proven track record.\u201d In fact, typically, more than one form of the ingredient is used in a product. The most common are butylparaben, methylparaben, and propylparaben. Over the last few years, however, in response to customer concerns, many brands have started to manufacture (and label) paraben-free products, including lotions, lipsticks, shampoos, scrubs, and more. So What\u2019s the Problem? \nIn the 1990s, parabens were deemed xenoestrogens\u2015agents that mimic estrogen in the body. \u201cEstrogen disruption\u201d has been linked to breast cancer and reproductive issues. And in 2004 British cancer researcher Philippa Darbre, Ph.D., found parabens present in malignant breast tumors. As a result, experts in many countries are recommending limits on paraben levels in cosmetic products. What\u2019s more, watchdog organizations worry that if parabens can be stored in the body, over time they could have a cumulative effect and pose a health risk. \nBut here\u2019s the flip side: Critics of the British study point out that noncancerous tissue from healthy breasts wasn\u2019t examined to see if parabens were also present there, and that the presence of parabens in tumors doesn\u2019t prove that they caused the cancer. Other studies have shown parabens to have a very weak estrogenic effect. All this leads to concern about the unknown. Cook-Bolden tells her patients that \u201cso far there\u2019s no scientific evidence to support any link with any form of cancer.\u201d Currently, the amount of parabens in any product is typically quite small. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization consider the chemicals safe at low levels. The Bottom Line? \nThere\u2019s reason to be mindful, but no reason to have an all-consuming concern about these chemicals. If it helps you rest easy, use a paraben-free body lotion (which coats a large area of skin). Today there are a number of formulas available from paraben-free brands (see below). Labels that list the preservatives as one of the last four ingredients also indicate that the chemicals are present in very small amounts, says Andrea Kane, editor of Theorganicbeautyexpert.com . \nIf you want to play it extremely safe, use a few oil-based organic products that don\u2019t contain water (which calls for a preservative). They often come in dark containers with a pump so that light and air don\u2019t degrade them quickly. \u201cWith truly natural products, just stay within their use-by date,\u201d says Kane. \u201cIt\u2019s like milk\u2015the date is there for a reason.\u201d Paraben-Free Brands ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cook-bolden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fran e. cook-bolden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippa darbre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrea kane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arthur rich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kane", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chestnut ridge", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T20:12:56.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8b30182b5d02bf8756aa7b0093ed8a9d79c21b84", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjhGMEq8RYRG6C9IkB8ecbAqRy3gZveZphW9Svx6hyskOYIqhaJjNkDE-", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "http://www.health.com/health/beauty-style/feed", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Beauty - Health.com", "title": "3 Bold New Ways to Wear a Red Lip", "title_full": "3 Bold New Ways to Wear a Red Lip", "published": "2017-10-16T21:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium_16_9/public/1506714363/3-ways-to-wear-a-red-lip-video.jpg?itok=l3_HPJhu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 12, "comments": 0, "shares": 12}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8b30182b5d02bf8756aa7b0093ed8a9d79c21b84", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjhGMEq8RYRG6C9IkB8ecbAqRy3gZveZphW9Svx6hyskOYIqhaJjNkDE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Health", "published": "2017-10-16T21:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "3 Bold New Ways to Wear a Red Lip", "text": "Beauty 3 Bold New Ways to Wear a Red Lip In this video we show you three eye makeup options to make your red lip look really pop.

The classic look is both sophisticated and sexy, and, contrary to popular belief, a bright lip doesn\u2019t always need to be paired with an otherwise neutral face. In fact, red lipstick pairs with plenty of different looks, like a cat eye or bright gold eyeshadow . In this video, we\u2019ll show you how to wear your tried-and-true red lip with three different types of eye makeup. \nRELATED: 6 Genius Ways to Match Your Lipstick to Your Sneakers \nBefore you get started on your eyes, though, you have to get your red lips right first. Start by lining them with a red lip liner , then fill in the center also using the liner. Next, top the lips with a red lipstick. And voila! Red lips, done. Now you just have to choose which makeup look to pair them with. Here, three options we love. \nCat eye \nUse black eyeliner to draw a diagonal line extending from the outer corner of the eye. Use the same pencil to then line your lash line. Next draw a second diagonal line extending from the outer corner of the eye at a slightly higher angle to create a small triangle with the lower line. Using your eyeliner, fill in the triangle to complete your sultry cat eye look. \nWATCH THE VIDEO: This Bold Makeup Look is Perfect for a Night Out \nNeutral eye \nApply bronzer to the eyelids and below the lower lash line. Use a soft brush to blend the product. Next add mascara to your bottom and top lashes for a subtle but sultry look. \nBold gold \nApply a shimmery gold eyeshadow to the eyelids, then blend the outer corners with a neutral-colored shadow. Add an extra layer of shimmery shadow to the bottom lash line. Finish off the eye-brightening look with a quick swipe of mascara on the bottom and top lashes.

Amanda MacMillan October 16, 2017 \nThere has been no shortage of insults during the first nine months of the Trump presidency\u2014both those directed at members of the administration, and those dished out by the commander-in-chief and his staff. But one specific insult recently caught the attention of two psychiatrists, who blogged about it on the BMJ website . \nIn July, in a now-infamous phone call to reporter Ryan Lizza, then-Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci referred to then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus as a \u201cparanoid schizophrenic\u201d\u2014using the name of a legitimate mental health condition as an insult directed at someone who, as far as we know, has no such diagnosis. And while this was a highly publicized event, it\u2019s just one example of a larger problem, says Arash Javanbakht, MD, director of the Stress, Trauma, and Anxiety Research and Clinical Program at Wayne State University and one of the article\u2019s authors. \nIt's a problem that's evident even without leaving the world of politics. On one side of the aisle, Trump himself has called people \"crazy\" and \"psycho\" in recent months. On the other side, psychiatrists have debated whether it's appropriate to question the President's own mental health . At least one psychiatrist says terms like dementia and narcissism are being thrown around without evidence , and are unfair to people who are truly ill. \nRELATED: 10 Signs of Narcissism \nJavanbakht, and his co-author Aislinn Williams, MD, weren\u2019t the only people to take issue with what Scaramucci said in July, or the way it was reported in the media. In their post, they reference a Teen Vogue op-ed that also points out \u201cthe profound problems\u201d with how news organizations reported the phone call, with most never mentioning \u201chow unacceptable and stigmatizing such a phrase is.\u201d \nAbout 1% of the world population actually has schizophrenia, Javanbakht and Williams note, and the disease affects several million Americans and their families and friends. \u201cThey are worthy of respect and should be met with support, but many of our profession\u2019s top journals and the news media at large, remained silent in the face of this onslaught.\u201d \nJavanbakht spoke with Health about his blog, and about the larger problem of mental-health illnesses being used in such derogatory ways. \u201cAnytime a medical diagnosis is used as an insult, it is basically an insult to an entire group of people that are not responsible for their condition,\u201d he says. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t insult someone by saying they have diabetes, so why would you insult them by saying the have schizophrenia?\u201d \nTo get more mental health stories, sign up for the Healthy Living newsletter \nUsing mental illnesses as insults can be directly harmful to people living with these conditions, and they can also spread inaccurate perceptions of what they really are, says Steven Meyers, PhD, professor of psychology at Roosevelt University. \nFor example, people may use the word schizophrenic to describe how someone can alternate between two different states, while the actual symptoms of schizophrenia involve poor reality perception, hallucinations, and confused thinking. \n\u201cAccurate information about the symptoms of a disorder can lead people towards diagnosis and treatment,\u201d say Meyers, \u201cwhile misinformation is more likely to promote stigma or cause us to dismiss or marginalize people.\u201d \nRELATED: 12 Signs You May Have an Anxiety Disorder \nJavanbakht and Williams note that in recent years, it\u2019s become socially unacceptable to make fun of people with illnesses like cancer, and that a public-relations campaign started by Special Olympics in 2008 has even had success reducing use of the \u201cR-word.\u201d \n\u201cAs psychiatrists, we need to speak up alongside our patients and help people understand that using mental illness as a pejorative is equally hurtful and unacceptable,\u201d they wrote. \n\u201cI\u2019m a neurobiological researcher, and to me there\u2019s no difference between a disease of the brain or a disease of the gut or any other area of the body,\u201d Javanbakht says. \u201cWe need to help people see diseases like anxiety , depression , schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder the same way they see diabetes , high blood pressure, or Crohn\u2019s disease .\u201d \nRELATED: 8 Celebrities on Their Struggle With Mental Illness \nThat starts with education, he says. \u201cWe know that 30% of the general population deals with some form of anxiety and 20% deal with depression, so chances are you have a family member or friend dealing with a mental health condition,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we can talk openly and learn about those conditions, we\u2019ll be able to develop empathy and see them for what they really are.\u201d \nMeyers says there\u2019s no widespread agreement about what is an offensive use of a mental health term, and that it always depends on context. \u201cSaying that someone has a \u2018crazy\u2019 idea isn\u2019t the same as labeling a person as a paranoid schizophrenic,\u201d he says. But when in doubt, he says, people should think about how their casual use of certain terms could impact others\u2014and if they hear those terms being used incorrectly, they should call it out. \n\u201cDerogatory words that were commonly used one or two generations ago in conversation don't appear as often because they have been challenged by friends, family members, professional communities, and the media,\u201d he says. \u201cSlang and joking will continue to occur, but the goal is incremental progress stemming from greater awareness and the elimination of the most insulting or serious misuses of these terms.\u201d You May Like", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ryan lizza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crohn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reince priebus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meyers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony scaramucci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven meyers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amanda macmillan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aislinn williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arash javanbakht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scaramucci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "javanbakht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "teen vogue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anxiety research and clinical program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wayne state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trauma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roosevelt university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bmj", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T04:39:47.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f79910fb1649e1454bb53b6afea585a16bafeef3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjkCo3JdC7319YApkrIn5CuatZKSzRcLeq_F_7QFNjPdJX.v34I.W_9EOI0_YLtSpbMz2B4Y7saJ.", "site_full": "www.health.com", "site": "health.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "9 Get-Fit Secrets to Steal From Personal Trainers - Health", "title_full": "9 Get-Fit Secrets to Steal From Personal Trainers - Health", "published": "2017-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.159, "main_image": "http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium_16_9/public/1507145012/GettyImages-510927648.jpg?itok=BlrV1V07", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 77, "comments": 0, "shares": 77}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f79910fb1649e1454bb53b6afea585a16bafeef3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOjkCo3JdC7319YApkrIn5CuatZKSzRcLeq_F_7QFNjPdJX.v34I.W_9EOI0_YLtSpbMz2B4Y7saJ.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jacqueline Andriakos", "published": "2017-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "9 Get-Fit Secrets to Steal From Personal Trainers - Health", "text": "Email Reebok \nThere are plenty of perks to having a personal trainer. But even fitness pros admit it\u2019s not impossible to get in shape sans supervision. \u201cYou know your workout preferences, personality, and body better than anyone else,\u201d says Gunnar Peterson , a celebrity trainer and the chief training officer for the fitness streaming service gymGO. Follow these essentials to get a trainer-tier sweat at every workout. Step 1: Do a self-consultation \nStart by getting clear about your aims, says fitness and wellness expert David Kirsch , owner of Madison Square Club in New York City. \nGo for mini goals. Set intentions you can measure in the short term, like \u201cI want to run three times this week.\u201d \nBuild a schedule. Plug every workout and rest day into your phone, with alerts. \nLog everything. Jot down a few notes about how your workout went when you finish. \u201cKeeping a log helps you see what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not,\u201d says Kirsch. Chest up, core tight! Check your form when you start to get tired. Step 2: Fix your form \nThe pros cringe when they see gym-goers moving through a routine with bad form. \u201cIt makes your workout less effective and may set you up for injury,\u201d warns Peterson. The following techniques help you find proper positioning. \nCarry a cheat sheet. There\u2019s no shame in pulling up a workout on your phone with images you can refer to. \nFilm yourself. Prop your phone against a wall to record your moves and see where form is suffering. Or just use a good old-fashioned mirror. \nHave posture check-ins. \u201cPeople tend to lean on cardio-machine handles, and their posture begins to suffer,\u201d says Kirsch. Every few minutes, remind yourself to stand tall and engage your core. On the elliptical or bike, make sure you\u2019re not relying on the machine to support your body weight. \nRelated Video: Celeb Trainer Harley Pasternak Shares a Go-To Move to Get Buns like Beyonc\u00e9 Up your accountability \n\u201cHaving a trainer of course forces you to show up every time,\u201d notes Peterson. \u201cBut people also tend to work harder in the presence of others.\u201d These tricks help you keep your commitment fiery without the extra helping hand. \nId your motivation style. Do you prefer cheerleader or drill sergeant?

In a previous interview with Health , Joshua Klein, MD, a reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, explained that the actual rate of pregnancy loss is likely around 25 percent or 30 percent, since some women in early stages of pregnancy may mistake a miscarriage for a heavier-than-normal period. \nUnion\u2019s honest comments are a reminder that miscarriages can affect anyone, but this isn\u2019t the first time an A-lister has opened up about a pregnancy loss. Here, 14 more celebrities who have spoken out about the pain and heartbreak of having a miscarriage. \nRELATED: 5 Things About Miscarriages You Probably Don\u2019t Know \nBeyonce \n\u201cThere are so many couples that go through that and it was a big part of my story.

We went through that not once but twice, me and my husband.\u201d \u2014 PBS , 2015 \nCeline Dion \n\u201cIt\u2019s life, you know? A lot of people go through this.

Consider this your guide to pet food label ingredients. Anthea Levi October 16, 2017 \nJust like human food, pet chow is full of health promises. Packaging boasts formulas that are grain-free and high in omega-3s . Cat food brands brag that they\u2019re \"holistic.\" After all, if Americans are ditching gluten and GMOs in their own food, it follows that they\u2019d spare their pets the same ingredients. But as with labels on people food, those on pet food can be confusing. Learn the truth behind common nutrition terms so you can put down a bowl you feel good about. Grain-free \nWhen half the humans you know are going Paleo , it\u2019s natural to wonder if your animal pal should, too. But for the vast majority of pets, it\u2019s not necessary to avoid grains, says Cailin Heinze, VMD, assistant professor of nutrition at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University. What\u2019s more, most food allergies in cats and dogs are to meats or other animal products rather than grains, she explains. Fiber-rich grains like millet, barley, and oats can actually improve an animal\u2019s digestion and boost good gut bacteria. That said, if you want to put your whole house on a grain-free diet, your pet likely won\u2019t suffer. Just note how well it digests substitutes like lentils or beans and tweak its food accordingly. Omega-3s \nNot all omega-3s are equal. Look for fats from fish; they have stronger anti-inflammatory effects than those from flaxseed and canola oils. \u201cSome type of fish oil should be listed in the top 15 ingredients,\u201d says Joseph Wakshlag, DVM, associate professor of clinical nutrition at Cornell University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine. \nRELATED: 11 Awesome Gifts for People Who Are Obsessed With Their Pets No fillers \nThis is perhaps the most meaningless term commonly used for pet food, says Heinze, who points out that even ingredients that don\u2019t deliver calories, vitamins, or minerals can bring health benefits. Fiber, for example, doesn\u2019t provide nutrients directly but can promote good gastrointestinal health. To ensure that your pet is getting the nutrition it needs, says Heinze, look for products that have the Association of American Feed Control Officials\u2019 (AAFCO) nutritional adequacy statement indicating that they are appropriate for your pet\u2019s life stage. Ash content \nThis refers to the amount of ground-up bone and other minerals in food. While ash does provide important nutrients, a high ash content may mean the food\u2019s protein balance isn\u2019t as strong, says Wakshlag. Call to find out the ash content (manufacturers aren\u2019t required to list it); around 6 percent is typical. DIY or buy? \nStudies show that homemade pet food only rarely provides the same balance of nutrients as the commercial type, which is required to meet specific standards. If you really plan to cook for your pet on a regular basis, Heinze suggests asking a veterinary nutritionist for recipes that are right for your pet and following them carefully.

October 16, 2017 I found out I had psoriasis when... \nI had this kind of buildup on my scalp, which, because my son played hockey at the time, I thought Oh, it might be bugs [from the hockey players]. I\u2019d never had bugs. Then I went to the doctor and he said, \"No, no, no, that\u2019s plaque psoriasis .\" He gave me some shampoo, and it kept it at bay a little bit, and then it started to spread. In 2012, it was really, really not good. By 2014, I was covered head to toe except for my face. I was able to hide it. But it took my strength. The hardest thing about my diagnosis was... \nI always had pretty skin when I was young. I thought I\u2019d never be able to feel my skin again. I gave up hope. I did every kind of treatment. I didn't realize that the cortisone cream was going to thin my skin out so much. I rubbed up against a cab one time and a piece of skin on my arm came off. \nYou\u2019re tired. It\u2019s an inflammatory disease so it kind of zaps your strength. And trying to sing, work out, and have all this [clothing] on, and then taking it off, your skin comes with it. It\u2019s awful. Emotionally, honestly, at the height of being that sick you feel very much alone. Actually, I\u2019m one of 7.5 million people in this country with psoriasis . When it flairs, it\u2019s real bad. People who suffer with it on their knees or elbows, it gets bad, it hurts. I still worked, but it was difficult. I had to get up in front of people acting like a big, strong woman and really you\u2019re just feeling your mortality. \nRELATED: The Different Types of Psoriasis I finally got help when... \nI came upon, through the National Psoriasis Foundation, a doctor who gave me options. The problem sometimes is you feel like you don\u2019t have options. \nI tried a lot of lifestyle changes , I really did. They didn\u2019t work for me. That\u2019s what pissed me off so much. I thought I\u2019d be gluten-free , I wouldn\u2019t drink alcohol, or do this or that, and it was so stressful that I figured it wasn't changing anything. After five years, I went on traditional medicine. At first I tried cortisone and realized those side effects were too much for me. So I talked about the options with my doctors. I chose the option I thought I could live with and that\u2019s how I\u2019m sustaining myself now. Now I can get back to the things I like to do, like singing and going on tour. \nAfter I started the medicine, the psoriasis started to go away, and I couldn\u2019t even believe it. I was always on eggshells. I still lather up with cream and am nervous because I don\u2019t want to go back to that. I advocate for psoriasis awareness because... \nOne person told me, \u201cYou\u2019re so famous, you can bring a voice to this like nobody else.\u201d [Psoriasis] is one of those things that no one wants to talk about, which makes it something I want to talk about. I just think in the world, for me, there are only unpopular causes. The popular causes will be taken care of, but the unpopular causes and the people who don\u2019t have a voice, those are the ones you should speak for. One misconception I wish people didn\u2019t have about psoriasis is... \nThat it\u2019s contagious. It\u2019s a very unattractive disease because you shed everywhere. \nAlso, there is hope. I want to write a song for the people who have gone through this and what they inspired in me, which was hope. I want someone who was just diagnosed with psoriasis to know\u2026 \nIt\u2019s not just a rash. Cream helps at first, and I hope it always helps, but it\u2019s something you should research right away. Don\u2019t let it go. Get information. Knowledge is power. \nTo get our top stories delivered to your inbox, sign up for the HEALTH newsletter To keep my mental health in check, I... \nCall the doctor. When you get the information and find a treatment for yourself, well, then you can meditate. You can take an Epsom salt bath. But don\u2019t go without treatment.

This style works on all hair types, including both shorter and longer lengths (and celebs like Emma Stone, Khloe Kardashian, and Jenna Dewan Tatum have all been spotted rocking the look). Here, three simple steps to master these effortless-looking, beachy waves. Rough it up \nBefore you pick up the flatiron, blast strands with a texturizing spray for better hold, advises celebrity hairstylist Justine Marjan. Frizz prone?

As you descend, continue rotating in half circles. Unpolish it off \nWhen you have 1 1/2 inches of hair left, pull the iron straight down\u2014blunt ends make it look fresh, explains Marjan. Next, apply a pomade, such as Fatboy Sea Salt Pomade ($21; urbanoutfitters.com ) to define waves and hold them in place throughout the day.

But did you know she's a total badass at the gym too? \nIn the new book The RBG Workout ($15, amazon.com ), Ginsburg's longtime trainer, Bryant Johnson, details the 84-year-old's impressive routine . The duo has been meeting for hour-long twice weekly sessions since 1999. \"Sometimes Justice Ginsburg and I chat, but mostly we just get down to it,\" Johnson writes. \"We usually listen to PBS NewsHour while we work, and she always gives it her all.\" \nThat much is clear once you start flipping through the 32(!) different strength exercises in Johnson's book.

Grasp a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing in and hold them to your chest, or just let them hang to your sides. \nB. Slowly bend your knees to a 90-degree angle while inhaling. Squeeze your buttocks, straighten your legs, and exhale slowly while returning to starting position, and repeat. Standing Cable Row \n3 sets/12 reps \nA.
