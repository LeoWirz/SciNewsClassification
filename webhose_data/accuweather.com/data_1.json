(AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) \n\u201cOur [more than 600] volunteers have been working around the clock to try to deliver food and water, along with other government partners and non-profit organizations,\u201d Eli said. \nIn Puerto Rico, ensuring accessibility to roads and emergency power for life-sustaining activities is a high priority, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). \nWorried individuals have struggled to reach family members in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands; FEMA reported that operational cell service in St. Thomas is at more than 48 percent and 21 percent in St. Croix. \nSome support from organizations including the Red Cross has helped to ease that burden. \n\u201cWe have these mobile satellites and we\u2019re bringing them along some of our aid routes in Puerto Rico,\u201d Eli said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s allowing people to charge their cell phones [and to] access Wi-Fi so they can reconnect with their family members, some of whom they haven\u2019t spoken to in maybe two weeks,\u201d she added. \nMore than half of people in Puerto Rico have access to drinkable water as efforts continue to restore quality. Forty-five percent of customers are able to drink water safely, following testing by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \nHowever, there have been reports that a cholera outbreak is imminent as a result of the lack of clean water. \nFactors including the presence of the V. cholera bacterium, weakened infrastructure and limited drinking water access can all contribute to outbreaks of the illness, according to the Baylor College of Medicine. \nOther diseases, including E. coli, typhoid fever and dysentery are additional disastrous risks, and dwindling medical supplies mean that typical treatments would not be readily available. \nA couple bathes in the Gurabo River in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, Monday, Oct. 2, 2017. (AP Photo/Carlos Giusti) \nAlthough power has been restored to at least 59 Puerto Rican hospitals, the lack of fuel supply to the island also poses a potentially deadly risk for people with kidney disease, who need to receive dialysis about three times per week to survive. \nRoughly 5,000 people in Puerto Rico face this threat, according to Mike Spigler, vice president of patient services at the American Kidney Fund. \nSome dialysis centers have been short on power and fuel to operate, The Hill reported, and many patients don\u2019t have fuel to get to the centers. \nPuerto Rico\u2019s secretary of public security, Hector Pesquera, said in an interview that the current death toll in Puerto Rico has not been updated in nearly a week. \nWhile the official government death toll stands at 16, Pesquera acknowledged that many additional victims may have died due to lack of support services in 70 percent of the island\u2019s hospitals, which were forced to close during Maria\u2019s impact. \nOrganizations like the Red Cross continue to provide those impacted by the storm with essential aid including drinking water and thousands of meals and snacks. \nThe Red Cross, which has a permanent presence in Puerto Rico, has also provided mental health services, Eli said. \nDespite the continued crisis, the recovery process in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Island is making progress. More than 65 percent of both grocery stores and gas stations are open in Puerto Rico, and 10 airports on the island have resumed operations, according to FEMA. \nSt. Croix and St. Thomas have also reported adequate fuel supply for power generation and response efforts. \n\u201cRecovery is a marathon, not a sprint, so it will certainly take time, not just to assess the needs and reach the people in need, but to make sure that people are able to rebuild back in a way that makes them safer [against] future disasters,\u201d Eli said. \nPresident Donald Trump is scheduled on Tuesday to visit Puerto Rico for the first time since Maria\u2019s impact on Sept. 20.

The combination of calm weather and low humidity means the area has experienced largely favorable weather for flood cleanup efforts since the storm. \nAn influx of tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico this week will collide with a cold front dropping into the area, promoting rounds of heavy downpours over the western Gulf Coast. \n\u201cThe concern is that [downpours] will be rather slow moving and any thunderstorm that develops can drop a staunch amount of rain in a short period of time,\u201d said AccuWeather Meteorologist Mike Doll. \nThese heavy storms could lead to localized flooding and travel disruptions both on the road and in the air. \nResidents of Houston, Corpus Christi and Brownsville, Texas, and Lake Charles, Louisiana, could face reduced visibility in any downpours as well as flooded roads. \nMotorists should take care to avoid flooded roadways and obey all road closures. \nThis will be the first time many Harvey-stricken areas have received significant rainfall since the hurricane flooded the region. \n\u201cFlooding will not be widespread, but any rain will obviously delay ongoing clean up,\u201d said Doll. \nFarther south where Harvey\u2019s impacts were minimal, the Rio Grande Valley is experiencing moderate drought conditions. \nRegardless of drought status, this pattern could bring flash flooding to area creeks and rivers and low-lying and poor drainage areas. \n\u201cDrier air will arrive Wednesday and cut off the moisture support for thunderstorms,\u201d said Doll. \nHowever, given the consistent onshore wind flow expected, coastal flooding will add to the influx of water into the region through midweek. \nm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

to clean up trash, debris after a natural disaster Published October 03, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \nAfter a major storm or natural disaster sweeps through an area, potentially damaging your home and littering your yard with debris, there are ways to ensure that the cleanup process is environmentally friendly. \nIn contrast to simply throwing the waste in a dumpster to be hauled off to a landfill, it\u2019s important to understand that the process of discarding waste in a sustainable manner will take some time and effort, said Matthew Hollis, president of Elytus. \nThe software technology and consulting firm helps businesses plan out sustainable waste strategies. \n\u201cThe best thing you can do is start to work through the waste that you have in your house and categorize it accordingly,\u201d Hollis said. \nTo help the process go smoothly, consider sorting out your potential waste in categories including food, appliances, clothing, yard debris and furniture. \n(Photo/LeCajun/Getty Images) \nFood waste \nThe next step is to figure out the best way to handle recovering or discarding damaged items. \nAn easy place to start is with spoiled food in your refrigerator, which is likely if there\u2019s an extended power outage. \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have food in your fridge that went bad, so that\u2019s organic waste,\u201d Hollis said. \u201cThat can be composted and it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to go to the landfill.\u201d \nSome compostable foods include grains, fruit, vegetables, eggshells, meat and dairy products. There are also facilities that convert food waste into renewable energy. \nClothing \nAny clothing that may have been ruined by the storm can be recycled, said Hollis. He recommended airing out clothing by hanging them rather than using a dryer. \n\u201cStart talking with organizations like the Goodwill or the Salvation Army,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of those organizations will take clothes that are damaged and sell it in textiles.\u201d \nThose textiles can then be shredded and turned into things like insulation, rags or carpet. \nAppliances \nA non-functioning household appliance can be used in other ways, including being recycled for parts. \n\u201cMaybe there are certain parts of the appliance that can still be used and can help others; [for instance,] they can take three broken stoves and combine it into one that works,\u201d Hollis said. \nIf the appliance is unable to be recycled for parts, examining the item and determining if there are any recyclable precious metals is also an option. \nFurniture \nIf a storm has ravaged your home, it\u2019s possible that your furniture may have been damaged by floodwaters or debris. Figuring out what is salvageable is a good starting point, said Hollis. \n\u201cThe best thing you can do is dry it out as best as you can,\u201d Hollis said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a metal table and you dried it out and it looks to be intact and un-rusted, then it\u2019s fine.\u201d \nHollis said that while glass can typically withstand the impact of water, furniture made of fabrics or wood may have to be recycled or de-constructed for re-purposing. \nStorm debris \nSeparating storm debris outside of your home is essential to helping the environment and preventing rodent infestations, said Laura Simis, an inbound specialist at Evergreen Lawn and Pest in Orlando, Florida. \n\u201cDry piles can be a fire hazard and moist piles smell like decomposition,\u201d Simis said. \u201cThey can also be hazardous if debris spills or blows into traffic.\u201d \nSimis recommended organizing storm debris according to the type of material. \n\u201cYard waste, [including] trees, branches, leaves, torn-up landscaping and shrubs, has to be separated out from construction materials [like] roof shingles, broken glass and drywall,\u201d she said. \nAfter considering these categories, you can sort out the typical items that you\u2019d normally recycle, including glass, plastic and cardboard, said Hollis. \nHard-to-recycle items, like Styrofoam, will likely be items that you\u2019d discard in the trash, he said. \nFor more safety and preparedness tips, visit AccuWeather.com/Ready .

"Tropical storm potential to increase in Gulf of Mexico, western Caribbean into next week Published October 03, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \nOne or two tropical systems may develop over the next 10 days from the central Gulf of Mexico to the central Caribbean Sea. \nBecause of the proximity to land, people may have little time to react and prepare for a tropical storm or hurricane. \nAccuWeather meteorologists are homing in on an area for tropical development late this week into early next week. \n\"A tropical system may bud near or just north of the Yucatan Peninsula,\" according to AccuWeather Hurricane Expert Dan Kottlowski. \nThe next name on the list of tropical storms in the Atlantic for 2017 is Nate. \n\"Any feature that develops in this area is likely to drift toward the north or northeast,\" Kottlowski said. \nShould a storm form and drift in the area aforementioned, Gulf Coast areas from Florida to Alabama, Mississippi and southeastern Louisiana could be at risk for damaging winds, coastal flooding, rough surf and beach erosion by early next week. \n\"Should the system develop just east of the Yucatan Peninsula, where waters are the warmest, we could have a powerful hurricane on our hands,\" Kottlowski said. \nPeople from Belize, the Cayman Islands, southeastern Mexico and western Cuba to the United States' northern and eastern Gulf Coast should keep up to date on the situation. \nIf the system waits to develop much farther to the north, over the northeastern Gulf Coast, where waters are cooler and disruptive winds are present, a tropical storm or depression may struggle to strengthen. \nHowever, even a weak tropical system could bring torrential rainfall and flash flooding. \n\"In lieu of a strong tropical system or flooding, beneficial rain may extend across the interior eastern U.S. next week, which could ease abnormally dry and building drought conditions in some locations,\" according to AccuWeather Meteorologist Brett Rathbun. \nAreas from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Central America and the islands in the central and western Caribbean will experience rounds of showers and thunderstorms, due to a broad area of disturbed weather over the next couple of weeks. \nIn addition to the risk of tropical storm formation near the Yucatan Peninsula, there is another area to watch. \n\"We will be monitoring the southern and central Caribbean for possible development around the third week of October,\" Kottlowski said. \nAny system that forms in that part of the Caribbean would move toward the very warm water and likely strengthen just east of the Yucatan Peninsula. \n\"The Atlantic basin may yield one more major (Category 3 or stronger) hurricane, which would bring the 2017 seasonal total to five,\" Kottlowski said.

Although however cold, low temperatures will pale in comparison to those in the northern Plains where the mercury is set to dip to minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit at times. \nMeanwhile, the southern Plains, Southwest and California can expect a milder and drier winter than last season. \nCold and snow to strike Northeast, mid-Atlantic \nA chilly winter is in store for the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, particularly when compared to last year. For most of both regions, this will translate to an above-normal snow season. \n\u201cAreas in the I-95 corridor will average close to normal, within a few inches,\u201d AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Forecaster Paul Pastelok said. \u201cAreas away from the I-95 corridor have a better chance at a big snowfall.\u201d \nNew York City and Boston, Massachusetts, may be the exceptions to this, with early predictions calling for 6 inches of snowfall or more above normal in both cities. \nAreas prone to lake-effect snow will also see high totals, including Cleveland, Ohio; Erie, Pennsylvania; and Buffalo, New York. \n\u201cI think this year is going to bring a good ski season in the Northeast,\u201d Pastelok said. \u201cAnd around the holidays we should have some snow for the interior Northeast.\u201d \nSevere weather may threaten Southeast, Tennessee Valley \nFarther south, air temperatures will face an east-west divide. \n\u201cThe Southeast is going to run above normal, especially in Florida and Georgia,\u201d Pastelok said. Both states will be at a lesser risk for a damaging freeze this year. \nAdditionally, Florida will remain mostly dry \u2014 good news for those recovering from Irma\u2019s impact in the fall. Meanwhile, western areas are more likely to receive bouts of colder weather. \n\u201cWe are expecting a few ice storms to develop based on the pattern we\u2019re seeing right now,\u201d Pastelok said. \nTwo to three are predicted to hit from the Tennessee Valley to northeast Texas. \nTornadoes are not out the question for either region. \nThe area from Texas to Georgia was hit with 137 tornadoes last January. This year, frequent tornadic activity may spin up in February. \nFrigid air to take hold in northern Plains \nArctic blasts are set to freeze the northern Plains this winter with temperatures sinking to subzero levels on a regular basis. \nTemperatures could plummet to minus 30 F at times in the Dakotas, Pastelok said. \nHowever, the frigid conditions are a trade-off for less snowfall. \nThe winter of 2016/2017 spawned colossal storms, dropping 140 percent of normal snowfall over the northern Plains and northern Rockies, according to Pastelok. This year will feature much less snow and drier conditions overall. \nTemperatures to bounce back and forth across southern Plains \nThe southern Plains will experience back-and-forth temperatures this season, with the middle of the winter being most likely to bring chilly conditions. \n\u201cColder air masses will bleed down and lead to freezes in later January,\u201d Pastelok said. \nThough the wintry air will be memorable, a cold winter isn\u2019t predicted overall. Some areas, such as southwest Texas, will average above normal for the season. \nDry periods will dominate over stormy weather overall. \n\u201cWe do feel there are going to be some storms in northwest Texas at times,\u201d he said. \u201cSouthwest Texas could see some but not as frequent as in past winters.\u201d \nDry periods will be welcomed by many following the havoc wreaked by Harvey near Houston. \nAbundant snowfall to bury Northwest, Rockies \nWith a weak La Ni\u00f1a predicted to develop this winter, the Northwest and the Rockies are set to receive an abundance of precipitation. \n\u201cI think the Bitterroot chain all the way down to the Wasatch region in the central and northern Rockies has a good shot to be above normal on snowfall this season,\u201d Pastelok said. \nEldora ski patroller Adam Clifton checks the density of the snow pack in a backcountry area of National Forest land adjacent to Corona Bowl, known for its extreme skiing, at Eldora Mountain Resort, near Nederland, Colo., Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2014. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley) \nThe Cascades are also predicted to benefit from abundant snowfall. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a good area to head out to if you\u2019re a big skier,\u201d Pastelok said. \nDrier, less snowy season in the offing for California \nAfter a big season for snowfall in central and Northern California last year, both regions are predicted to be less wet and snowy in the upcoming months. \nHowever, it won\u2019t spell bad news for ski season. \nSki resorts will receive enough snowfall to create good conditions, but not so much that people struggle to get to them, he said. \nIn the Southwest, drier and warmer weather will dominate. \nAccording to Pastelok, warmth will bookend the winter with temperatures capable of reaching into the 90s by early 2018. \nm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "linsley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul pastelok", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pastelok", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam clifton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "la ni\u00f1a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eldora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mid-atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la ni\u00f1a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rockies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northeast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dakotas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corona bowl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitterroot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern plains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern plains  arctic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colo.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pastelok", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffalo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wasatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southwest texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nederland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eldora mountain resort", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern plains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T16:02:18.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cdac460f2c528889a6434ac5c3eb504970e5801d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQXtmO4qP2vxqG3AJLCcWfn7vCTRThGjtpqvzUXHDIgPb6rgZeZUgR3uhBvE_wM3yOEkl7YXDVISL7MTePY869mBgfCbrIbe01QlWuijCHnbQ--", "site_full": "www.accuweather.com", "site": "accuweather.com", "site_section": "http://www.drudgereportfeed.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Drudge Report Feed", "title": "FORECAST: Bitterly COLD Winter Ahead...", "title_full": "FORECAST: Bitterly COLD Winter Ahead...", "published": "2017-10-04T17:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://accuweather.brightspotcdn.com/67/6f/ef75e7fc4102a4b1cb87717a5db8/2017-2018-us-winter-highlights.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 331, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 9973, "comments": 260, "shares": 9973}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 8}, "linkedin": {"shares": 80}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 1}}}, "uuid": "cdac460f2c528889a6434ac5c3eb504970e5801d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQXtmO4qP2vxqG3AJLCcWfn7vCTRThGjtpqvzUXHDIgPb6rgZeZUgR3uhBvE_wM3yOEkl7YXDVISL7MTePY869mBgfCbrIbe01QlWuijCHnbQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T17:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "FORECAST: Bitterly COLD Winter Ahead...", "text": "Search Aol.com Search US winter forecast: La Ni\u00f1a to fuel abundant snow in Rockies; Bitterly cold air to blast Midwest Jillian MacMath Oct 4th 2017 10:57AM \nSome chilly winter weather is in store for the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, with January threatening to bring the coldest air of the season.

The bright moon will illuminate the night side of the planet. This is a problem for stargazing. So, let's take a look at the brightest stars you can spot tonight. These stars will shine brilliantly despite moonlight. They can also be seen from cities with high light pollution. \nIf you want to see the brightest star of them all, you will have to get up early. Sirius is only visible for a few hours before sunrise, but it really stands out from other stars. It is twice as bright as any other nighttime star (but the planets Jupiter and Venus are brighter). \nYou can see it rise after Orion. It just so happens that Orion is made up of two of the top 10 brightest stars! Look for Betelgeuse, a super red giant, and Rigel. Betelgeuse is so large that if it were placed where our sun its, the outer edge would extend to the orbit of Mars, swallowing up the Earth! \nThe brightest star that is visible most of the night in the Northern Hemisphere is Vega. Look for it nearly overhead during the evening. Two other nearby stars are nearly as bright. The three of these stars form the summer triangle. It is named that because they become visible early in summer. \nThe brightest star in the evening sky is Arcturus. It will be visible for a few hours before it sets. Follow the arc of the handle of the Big Dipper to find this massive orange-colored star. \nThis timelapse from Accuweather.com Astronomy Facebook friend Ronald Shawley shows how much ambient light the moon adds to the rest of the night sky. Look how dark the sky gets towards the end of the video. That is after the moon has set, a few hours before sunrise. \nThanks for reading. Just look up, you never know what you will see!

A second landfall occurred near Biloxi, Mississippi, around 12:30 a.m. CDT Sunday. Nate has since weakened to a tropical storm, but still poses a threat to lives and property. \nNate will continue to move along at a swift pace northward through Sunday with heavy rain, tornadoes and locally damaging winds being the primary impacts moving forward. \nHeavy rain will continue to be a threat across the Deep South Sunday and will spread farther northward into the Tennessee and Ohio valleys as Nate's moisture surges northward. \n\"Rainfall totals of 4-8 inches will occur from the Panhandle of Florida through Alabama, eastern Tennessee and northwestern Georgia Sunday,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Rob Miller said. \nStorm drains that may be clogged with leaves will also be a factor that can lead to flooding. \nBeyond Sunday, the heaviest rain will shift into the northeastern U.S. \nWhile winds are not as strong as they were when Nate came onshore, there will still be isolated wind gusts strong enough to cause property damage, push down trees and lead to power outages into Sunday afternoon near Nate's center. \nWith Nate moving very quickly, wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph will extend far inland across Alabama and into Tennessee near the center of the system. The threat for sporadic power outages will exist across these areas. \nIsolated tornadoes can also occur well east of the center of Nate through Sunday. Outer rain bands from tropical systems can quickly spin up tornadoes, so folks will want to be on alert. \n\"The greatest threat for tornadoes will exist across parts of the Florida Panhandle, Alabama and far western Georgia Sunday,\" Miller said. \nAreas near the coast will continue to deal with coastal flooding through Sunday afternoon as strong winds continue to blow inland from the Gulf of Mexico. Water should gradually recede after being pushed inland through the day. \nAreas just east of where the center of Nate came onshore could still face coastal flooding through Sunday, which includes Alabama, Mississippi and the western Panhandle of Florida. The eastern coast of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina may also experience coastal flooding. \nWind and wave action will produce rough seas and dangerous surf throughout the Gulf of Mexico through Sunday. \nThe greatest coastal impacts will focus from part of the central Gulf Coast to the upper west coast of the Florida Peninsula. \nSmall craft throughout the Gulf of Mexico should remain in port. Bathers should avoid venturing beyond knee-deep water due to rip currents. \nConditions are expected to improve through the day Sunday for much of the Gulf Coast as Nate speeds away to the north. \nRELATED:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex sosnowski", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dan kottlowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joel n. myers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kottlowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "accuweather", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "central america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belize", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicaragua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honduras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf of mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida panhandle", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T15:00:09.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d32b73e9b53b75c7834acc4cd1672b19a7f903d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnuQ5iIuEJZ4_XXONpRljk33NsOo5B8_UTBwkkFKyCDYqdz9RMBKhgY6S62KRELUhW_CEgDxk956UwF5pkZAkiSWiok6FvK5_Lq0J.2tIizjhRjoLTFpetIGauWvICOCaaqMJLKkUt_91jKzwEn9AmjOYsO9TvVVtmG4ucn4FRzMj", "site_full": "www.accuweather.com", "site": "accuweather.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/national", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "Central America, Cuba, Mexico brace for widespread flooding, damaging winds associated with Tropical Storm Nate", "title_full": "Central America, Cuba, Mexico brace for widespread flooding, damaging winds associated with Tropical Storm Nate | Fox News", "published": "2017-10-05T17:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "performance_score": 7, "domain_rank": 331, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 709, "comments": 0, "shares": 709}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d32b73e9b53b75c7834acc4cd1672b19a7f903d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnuQ5iIuEJZ4_XXONpRljk33NsOo5B8_UTBwkkFKyCDYqdz9RMBKhgY6S62KRELUhW_CEgDxk956UwF5pkZAkiSWiok6FvK5_Lq0J.2tIizjhRjoLTFpetIGauWvICOCaaqMJLKkUt_91jKzwEn9AmjOYsO9TvVVtmG4ucn4FRzMj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AccuWeather", "published": "2017-10-05T17:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Central America, Cuba, Mexico brace for widespread flooding, damaging winds associated with Tropical Storm Nate", "text": "Tropical Storm Nate was already producing localized heavy rainfall in Central America and will raise the risk of flash flooding and high winds as it strengthens through Friday.\n\"Nate is projected to move northward and become a hurricane despite brushing land in Nicaragua, Honduras and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula,\" according to AccuWeather Meteorologist Brett Rossio.\nBecause of the proximity to land in Central America, people may have little time to react and prepare for a tropical storm or hurricane.\n\n\n\"Since the system will be moving over very warm waters, we could quickly have a powerful hurricane on our hands,\" according to AccuWeather Hurricane Expert Dan Kottlowski.\nA storm that reaches Category 1 status has the potential to reach Category 2 or 3 (major hurricane) status in a matter of hours.\nIn the short term, the most likely area for rapid strengthening will be the stretch of water north of Honduras and east of Belize.\nEven a weak tropical storm has the potential to bring flooding rainfall and dangerous surf and seas.\nThe greatest threats to lives and property in the western Caribbean will be from torrential rainfall.\n\n\nRainfall may total 250--500 mm (10-20 inches), with localized amounts of 760 mm (30 inches), across eastern portions of Nicaragua through Thursday night.\nCosta Rica and Panama can have 130-250 mm (5-10 inches) of rain with isolated amounts of around 500 mm (20 inches) through Thursday.\nRainfall amounts of 50-130 mm (2-5 inches) are anticipated to fall across Honduras with localized amounts reaching 200 mm (8 inches) into the end of the week.\nThe intense rainfall will lead to widespread flooding and mudslides across Central America, southeastern Mexico and western Cuba.\nThe severity of the winds will depend on how quickly Nate strengthens. However, intense wind damage similar to that of Irma and Maria farther east in the Caribbean in recent weeks is not likely.\nThere will be the potential for localized power outages, blocked roads and property damage.\nGusts of 65-97 km/h (40-60 mph) are likely in thunderstorms that erupt even 160 km (100 miles) away from the center.\nAs Nate strengthens through Friday night, the strongest wind gusts between 120 and 145 km/h (75 and 90 mph) are possible along the coasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, Belize and the Mexico states of Quintana Roo and Yucatan. Higher gusts are possible if Nate strengthens beyond a Catagory 1 hurricane.\n\nThis animation shows Tropical Storm Nate spinning along the coast of Central America on Thursday, Oct. 5, 2017. (NOAA/Satellite) \n\nBathers should avoid venturing into the water due to the building surf.\nSmall craft should remain in port, and cruise interests may want to avoid the northwestern Caribbean and the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico.\nBeyond the Caribbean, Nate will move northward toward the United States upper Gulf of Mexico coast, where landfall is forecast as a hurricane on Sunday.\nPeople in Nicaragua, Honduras, Belize, southeastern Mexico, the Cayman Islands, western Cuba and the United States' northern and eastern Gulf coast should keep up to date on the situation.\nIn addition to the risk from the current tropical system near Central America, there is another area to watch toward the middle of the month.\n\"The Atlantic basin may yield one more major (Category 3 or stronger) hurricane, which would bring the 2017 seasonal total to six,\" Kottlowski said.\nThe Atlantic basin includes the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.\nAccuWeather is projecting a total of 17 tropical storms, which includes 11 hurricanes, through December 2017 in the Atlantic.

Reed was infected when she fell into contaminated floodwater.\nThe most common way to identify necrotizing fasciitis is if a patient has a wound that is much more painful than they would expect based upon the wound\u2019s appearance. If the disease is suspected, a patient should seek emergency care and the infection should be diagnosed by a health professional.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t one thing you look at on the skin and say \u2018that\u2019s necrotizing fasciitis\u2019, it\u2019s the speed and the progression of necrotizing fasciitis and pain that\u2019s out of proportion compared to what you see visually,\u201d High said.\n\nJulie Rios, left, walks out of their flooded neighborhood with newly-met neighbor Gina Delber, right, as they evacuate their homes that are inundated by floodwaters from Tropical Storm Harvey on Monday, Aug. 28, 2017, in Houston, Texas.

If the condition is caught too late, surgery and amputation may be necessary to stop the virus from spreading.\nIf not treated, more symptoms will arise after the initial pain including fever, chills, fatigue and vomiting. Speed is most important in minimizing damage from the disease, so if it is suspected, immediate medical attention is recommended.\nThose cleaning up after hurricanes need to be mindful of any wounds they have. Open wounds should be cleaned and fully covered until healed. The most common form of contraction is from bacteria entering the body through a break in the skin. Open wounds include cuts, scrapes, burns, insect bites and puncture wounds.\nThough the occurrence of a hurricane increases the risk of contracting this disease, necrotizing fasciitis is extremely rare.\nApproximately 700 to 1,100 cases of necrotizing fasciitis occur in the United States each year, according to the CDC.\nWhile the disease is rare, it is fierce when it takes hold. One study cited a 73 percent mortality rate, according to the pathology department at the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences.\nThose with compromised immune systems are more at risk for contracting the disease. For example, obesity, diabetes, kidney disease and cancer all put someone at greater risk of being harmed by the disease. Those with any weaknesses in their immune system should be extremely careful during and after storms.\n\u201cPeople are so occupied by trying to get their lives back in order that often times they won\u2019t have the time or ability to pay attention to this,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Robinson, a certified adult and pediatric dermatologist. \u201cBut you really want to pay attention to any mild injury and take care of it immediately.\u201d\nm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T18:47:07.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61c9604883ce777e7534868d568e6d8ff8920def", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQXtmO4qP2vxqG3AJLCcWfn7vCTRThGjtpqvzUXHDIgPWFnKi0gqNgY6AYLbPfioLjnaFZpSTcBXOx6Kz8zpG2dGr8CT7wN.qKfXeYQijcrkkj4wqSxMUsvTrNyVC93vNnxZHoEFr4aYitzOkiYvKnM9WOSMCzoZ35FmghlqwE6dptkFl6EeUUc", "site_full": "www.accuweather.com", "site": "accuweather.com", "site_section": "http://baetrice.org/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FINDER TIPS", "title": "Contaminated floodwaters following hurricanes can bring life-threatening skin infection", "title_full": "Contaminated floodwaters following hurricanes can bring life-threatening skin infection", "published": "2017-10-06T19:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://baetrice.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/harvey-flood.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 331, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "61c9604883ce777e7534868d568e6d8ff8920def", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQXtmO4qP2vxqG3AJLCcWfn7vCTRThGjtpqvzUXHDIgPWFnKi0gqNgY6AYLbPfioLjnaFZpSTcBXOx6Kz8zpG2dGr8CT7wN.qKfXeYQijcrkkj4wqSxMUsvTrNyVC93vNnxZHoEFr4aYitzOkiYvKnM9WOSMCzoZ35FmghlqwE6dptkFl6EeUUc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BILLY REMPONCKY", "published": "2017-10-06T19:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Contaminated floodwaters following hurricanes can bring life-threatening skin infection", "text": "Contaminated floodwaters following hurricanes can bring life-threatening skin infection Contaminated floodwaters following hurricanes can bring life-threatening skin infection October 6, 2017 Skin No Comments Please Share \nThe damage of Hurricane Harvey is widespread, and well known, but even one month after the storm there are lingering effects that still pose risks to Texas residents. \n\u201cIn these flood situations, there\u2019s all that brackish water contaminated with sewage, and water, human waste, and animal filth and other things being a kind of culture broth for bacteria,\u201d said Dr. Whitney High, the director of dermatopathology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. \nIt is often forgotten that floodwaters are contaminated with unsafe materials.

Published October 08, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \nWhile spring is the most active time for severe thunderstorms across the United States, autumn brings another heightened risk of severe weather, particularly across the Southeast. \n\u201cThe second severe peak happens in the fall because you see the jet stream starts to shift southward in response to the Northern Hemisphere cooling off,\u201d AccuWeather Southeast Weather Expert Frank Strait said. \nSevere thunderstorms during the fall can be just as violent as those in the spring, bringing the threat of tornadoes, damaging winds and flooding downpours. \n\u201cIt's typical to see one or two significant severe storm events in fall,\u201d Strait said. \nThe southern United States is the area of greatest concern for severe weather in the fall as cold fronts diving from the north collide with warm, humid air originating from the Gulf of Mexico. \nWhile the most common area for severe weather in the fall ranges from Texas to Georgia, some storms occasionally impact areas farther north, including the central Plains and the Mississippi Valley. \n\u201cEven the mid-Atlantic region and lower Hudson Valley can get [severe storms] at times in October and November,\u201d AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Forecaster Paul Pastelok said. \nIn some cases, early winter storms diving into California can breed severe weather along part of the West Coast. \nTropical systems also contribute to the secondary peak of severe weather along the Gulf Coast, including the risk of tornadoes, according to Pastelok. \nHowever, the risk of severe weather from tropical systems slowly diminishes throughout the fall as the Atlantic hurricane season comes to an end on Nov. 30. \nA truck lies on its side in a neighborhood in Washington, Ill., Monday , Nov. 18, 2013, after a tornado hit the area on Sunday damaging or destroying as many as 500 homes. One death was confirmed in the town as a result of the storm. Illinois was the hardest hit by the unusually powerful late-season wave of thunderstorms that brought damaging winds and tornadoes to 12 states. (AP Photo/Armando Sanchez) \nEven though severe storms primarily impact the southern United States in the fall, those farther north should not let their guard down. \nOn Nov. 17, 2013, a severe weather outbreak led to 73 tornadoes from Tennessee to Illinois and Michigan, including seven EF3 tornadoes and two EF4 tornadoes, according to Strait. \nThis was one of the largest severe weather outbreaks for the state of Illinois, causing widespread damage and multiple fatalities. \nMultiple tornadoes touched down in northwestern Oregon on Oct. 14, 2016, an uncommon severe weather event for the area that damaged over 100 homes. \n\u201c[People] should keep in mind that severe weather can occur on any day of the year,\u201d Strait said. \nFor more safety and preparedness tips, visit AccuWeather.com/Ready .

Florida, which is no stranger to tropical storms, has no law that explicitly requires landlords to protect their rental properties or tenants from hurricanes. \nIt may be up to the tenant to decide what to do to protect their personal belongings and keep their families safe. \n\"There may be some cases where there is a gray area where leases don\u2019t specifically address who\u2019s responsible for storm preparation,\u201d said Ashleigh Cloud Trent, insurance advisor with Dallas-based Swingle Collins and Associates. \n(Photo/lisafx/Getty Images) \nIt's in a landlord's own self-interest to preserve the property and safeguard their rent-paying tenant, experts say. \nApartment dwellers make up 13 percent of Florida\u2019s population, 7.8 percent of South Carolina\u2019s residents and 7 percent of Louisiana\u2019s, according to the National Multifamily Housing Council. \nThe landlord\u2019s responsibilities are determined by their lease and state law, according to Daniel Watts, a California-based real estate lawyer. \n\u201cAlmost every state requires a landlord to provide a habitable residence for the tenant and nearly every lease will include a similar clause,\u201d Watts said. \n\u201cThe problem is that before a hurricane strikes, the house is still inhabitable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's only after the hurricane hits that the [residence] becomes uninhabitable and the landlord's duty to repair is triggered.\u201d \nIn many cases, in addition to not providing storm shutters for tenants, landlords will also prohibit tenants from installing shutters themselves or through a contractor. \nBefore Hurricane Irma impacted Florida, some residents complained about the lack of assistance from landlords, some of whom would not allow residents to use generators or install shutters over their windows. \n\u201cTo be truthful, [it\u2019s] probably for good reason, because you wouldn\u2019t want to have individual tenants having contractors work on the outsides of buildings on a piecemeal basis,\u201d said Steven Barshov, principal of New York City-based environmental law firm Sive, Paget and Riesel. \nExperts recommend that tenants openly communicate with a landlord about disaster preparedness plans before signing a lease, especially when living in areas prone to severe weather or natural disasters. A written agreement is stronger than a verbal one, according to experts. \n\u201cThat way, a landlord's inaction won't come as a surprise, and if it does, the tenant has some legal recourse for later events,\u201d said Emily Long, a home safety expert with SafeWise. \nGiven what many communities have endured in the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season thus far, these types of discussions will hopefully become more commonplace, Long said. \n\u201cTenants could reasonably make a case that storm protection is part of a landlord's obligation to provide maintenance and safety of major structures as laid out in a lease,\u201d she added. \nPurchasing renter\u2019s insurance before a storm is a relatively small investment that will help cover a tenant\u2019s personal belongings, which are not covered by a landlord\u2019s property insurance and supplemental damage policies, Long said. \nWhether being assisted by landlords or not, renters are still advised to take steps to protect their families and personal belongings, including creating 72-hour emergency preparedness kits and making copies of all important documents. \nThere may also be cases where the landlord allows tenants to protect windows with shutters or plywood. \n\u201cYour landlord may not take steps him- or herself, but may be okay if tenants do the heavy lifting,\u201d said Long. \n\u201cThis forgiveness versus permission issue is a fine line to walk and must be handled on a case-by-case basis,\u201d she added. \nFor more safety and preparedness tips, visit AccuWeather.com/Ready . \nm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paget", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emily long", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven barshov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riesel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "long", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel watts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashleigh cloud trent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watts", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national multifamily housing council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swingle collins and associates", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accuweather.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city-based", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T17:05:56.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "242a102df4ca3450cdecb01ff483c1390857e40f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnr5WSOoAFRm0dfiVSX3vzGFhKOZrZpgGCUGw4wD5wT7_aHsipytU20.R6d9RuzJu67Qq.sHX2oa2rvVTBPnADzUNSIGl3e5_o0NoScTw_C6OEpI7QwHWzDfiGH1BpvR8Wg--", "site_full": "www.accuweather.com", "site": "accuweather.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/national", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "Gusty winds to increase wildfire danger across Southern California through Monday", "title_full": "Gusty winds to increase wildfire danger across Southern California through Monday | Fox News", "published": "2017-10-09T17:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 331, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "242a102df4ca3450cdecb01ff483c1390857e40f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnr5WSOoAFRm0dfiVSX3vzGFhKOZrZpgGCUGw4wD5wT7_aHsipytU20.R6d9RuzJu67Qq.sHX2oa2rvVTBPnADzUNSIGl3e5_o0NoScTw_C6OEpI7QwHWzDfiGH1BpvR8Wg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AccuWeather", "published": "2017-10-09T17:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Gusty winds to increase wildfire danger across Southern California through Monday", "text": "Email \nWhile autumn has been relatively calm in Southern California so far, a Santa Ana event will bring strong winds to the area early this week. \nLight winds out of the Mojave Desert on Monday will rush down the San Emigdio, San Gabriel, San Bernardino and Santa Ana mountains, resulting in hot, gusty weather throughout and west of the mountains. \nWinds could gust upwards of 60 mph, toppling trees and power lines.

This will reduce the spike in temperature during the afternoon hours, as some of the sun's energy will be used to evaporate that moisture, rather than heat the ground and air in the lowest part of the atmosphere. \n\"Another factor against multiple days of extreme warmth will be cloud cover,\" Pastelok said. \n\"Since the days are much shorter now, when compared to August or early September, a few hours of clouds or fog can really hold temperatures back.\" \nWhile temperatures may not be as extreme and persist as long as the peak of the heat in September, expect highs in the 70s to be common from Chicago to New York City. Highs are likely to be in the 80s on multiple days from Oklahoma City to Atlanta. There may be a day here and there where temperatures peak in the 80s and near 90 respectively. \nAt night, most people should be able to sleep without the air conditioner on. The lengthening nights during October will allow temperatures to slip back to 10 to 20 degrees lower than the previous day's high. \nA northward bulge in the jet stream is forecast to persist over the southeastern half of the nation most of the time through much of the balance of the month. \nThe jet stream is a high-speed river of air at the level where jets cruise at. South of the jet stream, temperatures are often warm. Up until nearly the end of the month, the jet stream will extend from the central Rockies to southeastern Canada. \nWhile the jet stream will occasionally dip southward for a couple of days here and there, it is forecast to spend much more time in that northerly position rather than dip deep into the south. \nThe warm weather may delay or prolong the viewing opportunity for the fall foliage in some areas, at least where prior drought or gusty winds and rain from Nate have caused the leaves to fall off in the first place. \nThe same pattern responsible for the persistent warmth will keep the door open for tropical activity in the coming weeks. \nm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul pastelok", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pastelok", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south central", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rockies", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T21:49:19.059+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "733fdb47daa6d62423fac2e53ffa2dac1d2f78b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwntAzuvaUZ7DSgjVFhB0prl52dtGISmWe9Pi.JmzuT1jSzm0qFs0YSK0vqJjC8nA5XbcsXHQNaAdODF8zylhwqbDcdGPu2AFEo4KqJ9qYgpQ5acowqapGwIU-", "site_full": "www.accuweather.com", "site": "accuweather.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/national", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "Reports: Wildfires rage across northern California as thousands evacuate", "title_full": "Reports: Wildfires rage across northern California as thousands evacuate", "published": "2017-10-10T08:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 331, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 130, "comments": 0, "shares": 130}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "733fdb47daa6d62423fac2e53ffa2dac1d2f78b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwntAzuvaUZ7DSgjVFhB0prl52dtGISmWe9Pi.JmzuT1jSzm0qFs0YSK0vqJjC8nA5XbcsXHQNaAdODF8zylhwqbDcdGPu2AFEo4KqJ9qYgpQ5acowqapGwIU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-10T08:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Reports: Wildfires rage across northern California as thousands evacuate", "text": "Reports: Wildfires rage across northern California as thousands evacuate Published October 10, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \nDestructive wildfires continue to rage in California's wine country as strong winds threaten to enhance the blazes. \nAt least 10 people have been killed and over 100 people have been injured, according to the Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Carlos Giusti) \nA recent study by the Universal Ecological Fund, a nonprofit research organization, found that climate change has cost the United States $240 billion per year over the past decade. \nThe $240 billion includes economic losses from extreme weather events ($42 billion), economic losses from frequent weather events ($10 billion) and health costs due to air pollution caused by fossil fuel energy production ($188 billion). \nFor reference, $240 billion is 40 percent of the current growth of the United States economy and 1.2 percent of the GDP. The study predicts that this number will grow within the next decade. \nThe damages caused by extreme weather events have cost the United States more between 2007 and 2016 than any other recorded decade. \nThe study notes that extreme weather events are the result of natural causes to an extent. However, human activity can contribute to the frequency and intensity of these events. \n\u201cThe evidence is undeniable: the more fossil fuels we burn, the faster the climate continues to change,\u201d wrote the scientists who conducted the study. \nIn the 1980s, there were 21 extreme weather events that caused a minimum of $1 billion in economic losses; in the 1990s, there were 38; between 2007 and 2016, there were 92. \nOf the extreme weather events, severe storms have increased the most with a four-fold increase compared to the 1990s. Both the number of droughts and the number of flooding events have doubled since then. \nBetween 2007 and 2016, hurricanes caused $144.6 billion in economic losses, compared to $97 billion in the 1990s and $36.1 billion in the 1980s. \nIn addition to hurricanes, droughts have cost the United States economy $85.8 billion, wildfires have cost $15.5 billion and flooding events have cost $46.8. The 92 events that occurred across the United States between 2007 and 2016 caused $418.4 billion in damages. \nThe economic cost of the three major hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the wildfires that have spread throughout nine Western states in 2017 could be just as high as the loss from the 92 events that happened between 2006 and 2017. \nThe study predicts that, despite recent efforts combating air pollution, that the $240 billion in economic losses could increase to $360 billion per year over the next decade due to the Trump Administration\u2019s \u201cpro-coal\u201d policies and a lack of funding to combat climate change. \nConcluding with a call to action, the authors state \u201cactions we take every day where we live, where we work, where we study, how we travel, what we buy, how we build, even what we eat can contribute to climate action and make a difference.\u201d \nm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

The stronger the high pressure area, the stronger the winds can be. \nHowever, a new area of high pressure is forecast to build from the coastal Northwest states toward the Great Basin this weekend. \nThis high pressure area is about as strong as the high pressure area from last weekend. \n\"The risk of wildfire ignition and rapid spread will increase this weekend,\" Duffey said. \n\"North to northeast winds will kick up and become gusty.

However, making a few changes can dramatically impact the environment. \nThe average American is responsible for about 18 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions annually. The bulk of emissions come from home energy use, transportation, food consumption and things that people buy. \nBelow are ways to reduce carbon emissions and how much those changes help the environment. \nHome energy use \nHome heating and cooling counts for an average of 17 percent of emissions. \n\u201cGetting a programmable thermostat and using it properly could save you 15 percent,\u201d said John Rogers, a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \n\u201cYou program it, set it and forget it, and you can save a bundle versus someone who leaves it on all the time,\u201d Rogers added. \nA programmable thermostat can save an average of $180 per year, according to experts at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \n(Photo/John Keatley/Getty Images) \nGetting rid of air leaks will also help. Sealing up air leaks around doors, windows and in walls can save between 15 to 25 percent on heating and cooling energy losses and as much as $275 annually. \n\u201cWhat stats like that tell us is that there are simple things we can do that can have a pretty big impact on our personal carbon emissions,\u201d Rogers said. \nSwitching to geothermal energy, which is a clean, renewable energy source generated and stored within the earth, can save a person up to 70 percent in energy costs, or about $200 off of a $300 electric bill, according to experts at Pinewood Forrest. \nThe urban community in Fayetteville, Georgia, aims to become the first large-scale fully geothermal community in the United States. Each home will be outfitted with a geothermal heat pump in place of a traditional HVAC system. \nGeothermal power uses the consistent temperature below the earth\u2019s surface to heat and cool homes in a more efficient, affordable and longer-lasting way than traditional HVAC systems. \n\u201cIf HVAC is the largest user of energy in your home, we need to focus there,\u201d said Rob Parker, president of Pinewood Forrest. \n\u201cGeothermal energy is the answer for that,\u201d he added. \u201cUsing the earth and the energy that comes from it to be able to cool your home is significant.\u201d \nCompared to a traditional system, which typically lasts around 12 years, geothermal power can last beyond 50 years. \nTransportation \nModes of transportation make up 28 percent of the average American\u2019s emissions. \nIf a person drove 30 miles round trip to work each day, the person will have driven 7,800 miles each year. \nA simple way to cut down on emissions is choosing a car with better gas mileage, which could save you approximately 4,500 gallons of gas over a car\u2019s lifespan. \n\u201cThe single-most important thing you can do is probably upgrade your car,\u201d Rogers said. \n\u201cIf you go from a car that gets 20 miles per gallon to one that gets 40 miles per gallon, you will save, if you drive the average amount, almost 4 tons of CO2 a year,\u201d he said. \nDriving an 84-mile-range electric car cuts emissions by more than 50 percent when compared with a similar-sized gas-powered vehicle, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. \nCarpooling, taking mass transit, walking or biking can also save one pound of carbon dioxide for every mile a person doesn\u2019t drive, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. \nFood choices \nOne of the biggest culprits of CO2 emissions in a person\u2019s diet stems from red meat consumption, which makes up an average of 14 percent of emissions. \nDr. Jennifer Jay, professor of environmental engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), compared the carbon emissions in a serving of beef chili to that of a serving of lentil soup. \n\u201cIf someone chose lentil soup, it has around 70 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent in that serving,\u201d Jay said. \u201cBeef chili has just over 3,000 grams of CO2 equivalent, so you can see the big difference in where we choose to get our protein.\u201d \nOpting for a serving of lentil soup over beef chili for just one meal saves the emissions equivalent of driving 13 miles in a 40 mile-per-gallon vehicle, Jay said. \n\u201cRuminant animals have an extra impact in that their natural process produces methane, so, their digestive process produces methane, and that\u2019s a really highly potent greenhouse gas,\u201d Jay said. \nBy cutting food-related emissions in half, a family of four that consumes the average amount of red meat will save around 3 tons of carbon emissions annually. \n\u201cThat\u2019s about as much as half a year\u2019s worth of driving,\u201d Rogers said.

It stalled over Central America and killed nearly 20,000,\" Samuhel said. \nIn October and November, water in parts of the Atlantic tends to be at the warmest levels of the year, since ocean cooling lags behind cooling of the air. \nThe ocean heat content or what meteorologists call \"available energy\" for hurricanes can be quite high in the western Caribbean during October. \nWhen the warm ocean water evaporates, it heats the surrounding air, which fuels the growth and intensity of a hurricane. \n( Image/NOAA) \n\"For hurricanes, the water is extremely warm there [in the western Caribbean] this time of year, and it\u2019s warm very deep down,\" Samuhel said. \nHere are some of the most notorious hurricanes that have struck in October. \nHurricane Matthew 2016 \nFormed: Sept. 28, 2016Dissipated: Oct. 10, 2016 \nMatthew brought devastating flooding, strong winds and moderate storm surge to the coast of eastern North Carolina on Oct. 8 and Oct. 9. \nThe maximum storm surge measured by a tide gauge in the United States was 7.70 feet above normal tide levels in Fort Pulaski, Georgia. Matthew also produced storm surges of 6.96 feet at Fernandina Beach, Florida, 6.20 feet at Charleston, South Carolina, and 6.06 feet at Hatteras, North Carolina. \nChris Hinds walks between boats pushed up amongst the twisted docks at Palmetto Bay Marina damaged by Hurricane Matthew in Hilton Head, S.C., Sunday, Oct. 9, 2016. (AP Photo/David Goldman) \nHurricane Matthew caused damage from Florida through the Carolinas with wind damage and flooding. \nMatthew was a powerful and devastating tropical cyclone, which became the first Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic since Felix in 2007. The storm caused a total of 15.1 billion in U.S. dollars of damage. \nSuperstorm Sandy 2012 \nFormed: Oct. 22, 2012Dissipated: Nov. 2, 2012 \nEven though Sandy was not a hurricane when it hit, Sandy is prime example of a monster October storm that can cause devastation. \nHome in Ortley Beach, New Jersey, caused by Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall near Brigantine, New Jersey, on October 30, 2012. (skrum/Getty Images) \nIn the United States, Superstom Sandy affected 24 states, with particularly severe damage in New Jersey and New York. Its storm surge hit New York City on Oct. 29, flooding streets, tunnels and subway lines and cutting power in and around the city. The damage in the U.S. amounted to US$71.4 billion. \nHurricane Wilma in 2005 \nFormed: Oct. 16, 2005Dissipated: Oct. 27, 2005 \n\"Wilma is famous for being the strongest hurricane ever in the Atlantic basin. It had the lowest barometric pressure reading of any hurricane in the history of the basin,\" Samuhel said. \nWilma eventually made landfall in Florida as a Category 3 hurricane. \nSmall planes are seen damaged under hangars at Boca Raton Airport Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2005. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) \n\"Wilma reached its peak intensity over the western Caribbean, which is no surprise, as that area has the most available energy,\" Samuhel said. \nWilma tossed hundreds of railroad cars from their tracks and left more than 6 million Floridians without electricity. \nWilma is among the top-five costliest Atlantic hurricanes as it caused US$29.4 billion in damage. \n\"It is also the costliest hurricane in Mexican history. It basically stalled over Cancun and Cozumel as a Category 4 hurricane,\" Samuhel said. \nHurricane Mitch 1998 \nFormed: Oct. 22, 2005Dissipated: Nov. 9, 2005 \nMitch caused a storm surge of up to 4 feet in the lower Florida Keys before making landfall on the Florida west coast. \nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, tornadoes from the storm damaged or destroyed 645 houses across the state of Florida, in addition to injuring 65 people. \nDue to its slow motion, the hurricane dropped historic amounts of rainfall in Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua. \n\"It stalled over Central America and killed nearly 20,000,\" Samuhel said. Mitch is the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane on record. \nResidents of Tegucigalpa, Honduras, sort through debris Tuesday, Nov. 3, 1998, on a downtown city street. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull) \nAs a result of the hurricane, roughly 2.7 million people were left homeless. Mitch's flooding caused extreme damage, estimated at over US$6 billion. \nHurricane Opal in 1995 \nFormed: Sept. 27, 2005Dissipated: Oct. 6, 2005 \nThis hurricane hit the western Florida Panhandle near Pensacola as a Category 3 hurricane with 115-mph winds. \nOpal rapidly weakened after moving inland and was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved across southern Alabama. \nAngela Veal looks over the damage left by Hurricane Opal on the shore of Choctawhatchee Bay Thursday, Oct. 5, 1995.

Hurricane Opal's damage amounted to US$5.1 billion. \nHurricane Hazel 1954 \nTotal fatalities: Death toll estimated to be between 400 and 1,000Formed: Oct. 5, 2012Dissipated: Oct. 18, 2012 \nLandfall occurred on the North Carolina/South Carolina border on Oct. 15. The coastal area near the landfall was battered by winds estimated to have been as high 150 mph.

Winds gusted over 90 mph in Washington D.C.,\" Samuhel said. \nA gust to 113 mph was reported at the Battery, a park in New York City, but the storm didn't stop there. \n\"Hazel produced the worst flooding in the history of Toronto,\" Samuhel said.

This occurred as residents grapple with the storm's aftermath, and 40 percent of Puerto Ricans do not have drinkable water, according to CBS News.\nThe non-tropical storm with its showers and thunderstorms will drift across the Bahamas at midweek and Florida by the end of the week then into the Gulf of Mexico this weekend.\nThere have been destructive hurricanes during late October and November.

Saturday, it will feel like an extension of summer from the southern Plains through the middle Mississippi Valley and into the lower Great Lakes. \nRecord highs may be challenged as temperatures soar 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit above mid-October normals along this corridor. \nSt. Louis could come close to their daily record high of 90, set in 1899, at the start of the weekend. \nThe warmth will be erased as quickly as it arrived. \nOne of the storms set to bring a fresh chill to the Northwest will gain moisture and strength as it clashes with the warmth over the Plains this weekend. \n\u201cThis will not only set the stage for heavy rain, but also for severe thunderstorms,\u201d AccuWeather Meteorologist Ryan Adamson said. \n\u201cThe most likely area for severe weather will be from central Iowa southwestward through southeastern Nebraska, central and eastern Kansas, northwestern Missouri and northwestern Oklahoma on Saturday afternoon,\u201d he added. \nHeavy and gusty thunderstorms could extend as far north as southern Wisconsin, depending on how much sun peeks out during the day. \nDamaging winds, hail and localized flooding will be the most widespread impacts, but an isolated tornado or two cannot be ruled out, especially as the storms initially develop during the afternoon. \nA zone of soaking rain will set up to the north of the severe weather, leading to a damp start to the weekend across the upper Mississippi Valley and upper Great Lakes. \nThose with plans to travel the nation\u2019s midsection along stretches of interstates 29, 35, 70, 75, 80 and 90 may need to allow extra time to arrive at their destinations due to the downpours and reduced visibility. \nThere will be good news as any rain that falls will help to ease the widespread abnormally dry to moderate drought conditions occurring across the central U.S. \n\u201cWhile temperatures will be lower than they have been for the past couple of weeks in many areas [behind the storm], most areas will see readings right around normal for the middle of October [early next week],\u201d Adamson said. \nThe air may be cool enough and catch up fast enough with the back end of the storm for rain to mix with or changeover to snow across the Upper Midwest on Saturday night. This would bring the first snowflakes of the season for northern Minnesota and possibly northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. \nWarmth will quickly return to the region by the middle of next week.

The smoke can pose serious health threats ranging from irritated eyes to heart and lung problems. \nResearchers who examined the health impacts of U.S. wildfires from 2008 to 2012 found that up to 8,500 people are sent to the hospital with smoke-related respiratory issues annually. \nMore than 2,000 people each year succumb to the effects of wildfire air pollution, research shows. \u201cAnytime you talk about smoke inhalation, it\u2019s a potentially a life-threatening situation,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Ordon, an ENT specialist, general surgeon and co-host of \u201cThe Doctors.\u201d \n\u201cIf you inhale too much smoke, it can lead to respiratory failure and you\u2019re not exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide the way you\u2019re supposed to,\u201d Ordon said. \n(Photo/mack2happy/Getty Images) \nWhen the result of burning trees and grass is inhaled, a person is breathing in more than just smoke and ashes. \nToxins and fumes are added to the harmful mix when other things burn, like plastic from house fires. \n\u201cIf you\u2019re close to the fire, you\u2019ll be exposed to carbon monoxide, which poisons your red blood cells and interferes with oxygen uptake, [as well as] nitrogen dioxide, which dissolves in the airway lining fluid to generate a powerful acid that hurts small airways,\u201d said Dr. Brian Christman, a volunteer spokesperson for the American Lung Association. \nOf particular concern is the inhalation of tiny particles about 2.5 micrometers in diameter and about 1/20 th the width of a human hair, Christman said. \n\u201cThese are small enough to be carried into the alveoli, the tiny air sacs of the lung,\u201d he said. \nThis can significantly increase the risk of stroke and heart attack. \nHealth impacts \nWildfire smoke can cause or worsen a number of health problems, including reduced lung function, infectious bronchitis, asthma and heart failure, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n\u201cWhen you\u2019re breathing things in, before they get to the lungs, you\u2019re affecting all of your upper airways \u2013 your nasal cavity, oral cavity, throat and vocal cords,\u201d Ordon said. \nSinus trouble and increased cough can also occur. Children, the elderly and people with certain pre-existing conditions, including congestive heart failure, cystic fibrosis and allergic rhinitis, are particularly at risk. \n\u201cIf somebody has underlying respiratory problems, like asthma, emphysema, COPD and if you\u2019re a smoker, these people get into trouble quickly because they already have a compromised respiratory and pulmonary function,\u201d Ordon said. \nRecognizing the symptoms \nWildfire smoke\u2019s impacts on the human body can present themselves in a number of ways and can lead to chronic health issues. \n\u201cLook for changes in your voice and burning in the nasal cavity, the mouth and the throat, which would indicate that you are getting exposure that is irritating the lining of your airway,\u201d Ordon said. \nOther symptoms include headache, eye irritation, chest pain, sore throat, runny nose and shortness of breath. \nThose with heart disease and respiratory issues will likely experience worsening symptoms including tiredness, coughing or wheezing. \nExperts advise anyone experiencing such symptoms to seek immediate medical attention. \nHow to stay safe \nTo minimize the threat of wildfire smoke, it is recommended that those in impacted areas remain inside with doors and windows shut to keep the polluted air outside. \nDrivers are also advised to keep windows closed and set the air conditioning to recirculate mode. \nWearing the appropriate mask is crucial, because not all masks will prevent wildfire smoke inhalation. \n\u201cThere are a lot of good, high-quality masks available,\u201d Ordon said. \u201cMake sure that it\u2019s one that is high grade and has a rating system that will keep the majority of particles and smoke filtered out.\u201d \nAppropriate masks include N95 or P1000 disposable particulate respirators, and dust masks are not recommended. \nKeeping an eye on local air quality reports and using an air filter in your home will also help reduce the risk of smoke exposure. \nFor more safety and preparedness tips, visit AccuWeather.com/Ready . \nm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew ordon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian christman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national interagency fire center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american lung association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environmental protection agency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accuweather.com", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T17:47:02.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c067baa4da0778817243d76073c9bb71ca18cfa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnpQAqnpv2CSTVdInfpdbp07ud2erakm9Qvnt_cnLsGxQ70X.AVWDGdznaTUXCOtVIPRM5G3NWCKUCkamLaeWWpS.4mFILZr8J07ZDZeKe5jE74SBy5loqgo-", "site_full": "www.accuweather.com", "site": "accuweather.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/national", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "Potent storms from the Pacific to bombard British Columbia, northwestern US", "title_full": "Potent storms from the Pacific to bombard British Columbia, northwestern US", "published": "2017-10-12T17:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 331, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1285, "comments": 0, "shares": 1285}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c067baa4da0778817243d76073c9bb71ca18cfa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnpQAqnpv2CSTVdInfpdbp07ud2erakm9Qvnt_cnLsGxQ70X.AVWDGdznaTUXCOtVIPRM5G3NWCKUCkamLaeWWpS.4mFILZr8J07ZDZeKe5jE74SBy5loqgo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-12T17:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Potent storms from the Pacific to bombard British Columbia, northwestern US", "text": "Email \nPotent storms will begin to bombard British Columbia and the northwestern United States during the second half of October. \nThe northern Pacific storm season is starting a little early this year. Typically, storms and their impact on the Northwest ramp up during November, rather than the middle of October. \nThe storms that brought some rain and mountain snow to the region this week will likely pale in comparison to what lies ahead. \nAfter a tranquil but chilly weekend, the storms will bring rounds of drenching rain, heavy mountain snow and strong winds starting early next week. \n\"A plume of moisture is setting up across the northern Pacific Ocean,\" according to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brett Anderson. \n\"Storms are lining up like boxcars of moisture on a freight train,\" he said. \nThe bulk of the storms will focus from southern British Columbia to Washington. However, the storm track will fluctuate somewhat from north to south from storm to storm. \n\"Storms also got off to an early start in the Northwest last year,\" according to AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Meteorologist Paul Pastelok. \n\"However, unlike last year, where the storm track shifted southward and focused on California, we expect the storm train to linger in the northwestern U.S. and British Columbia much of this winter,\" Pastelok said. \nSome heavy rain, mountain snow and gusty winds will reach as far south as Oregon and part of Northern California as the pattern progresses next week. \nRainfall from the storms could help ease the dry conditions. \nOne of the storms may drop far enough to the south to bring a chance of rain to wildfire-ravaged areas near San Francisco, Sacramento and Santa Rosa, California, later Wednesday and into Thursday of next week. \nLocally heavy rain, snow and wind are likely to extend well inland to the southern Canada Rockies and the northern Rockies of the U.S. during the second half of October. \nPortions of British Columbia, Alberta, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and the western part of the Dakotas are experiencing conditions ranging from abnormally dry soil to exceptional drought. \nHeavy mountain snow may help to get the ski season off to a fast start. \nAs with any potent storms or series of storms, too much rain may fall too fast and trigger flash flooding problems. At the very least, highway travel and airline delays will mount. \nWinds from some of the storms may be strong enough to down trees and cause power outages. \nAs is often the case, temperatures and especially snow levels will vary with and within each storm. Snow is likely to dip down to the major passes during some of the storms. \n\"The varying snow levels and gusty winds will pose a great risk to hikers in the region,\" Anderson said. \n\"The risk of avalanches will increase.\" \nAreas along the coast will take a battering from heavy seas and above-normal tides. \nThe details and timing of each storm will be revealed as the storms approach the West Coast. \nm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul pastelok", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pastelok", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brett anderson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "british columbia", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "canada rockies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accuweather", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dakotas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sacramento", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rockies of the u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idaho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa rosa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T18:46:52.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d2245c191139320b22cd6ab29e38ea0e869e7e15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnhYKP.2G2r2sdO6CJuUZoHv95NND7fjXicbV.vQbcvnipWYbqRfMxGFIShG5kBVxKiAd6EYjogPZy9k_Jz_MilYzftc4xL9y.g--", "site_full": "www.accuweather.com", "site": "accuweather.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/national", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "Sunny, dry conditions to unfold for most of Week 6 NFL games", "title_full": "Sunny, dry conditions to unfold for most of Week 6 NFL games", "published": "2017-10-12T19:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 331, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d2245c191139320b22cd6ab29e38ea0e869e7e15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnhYKP.2G2r2sdO6CJuUZoHv95NND7fjXicbV.vQbcvnipWYbqRfMxGFIShG5kBVxKiAd6EYjogPZy9k_Jz_MilYzftc4xL9y.g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-12T19:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sunny, dry conditions to unfold for most of Week 6 NFL games", "text": "The halfway point of the NFL regular season is approaching quickly, and divisional and playoff races are starting to take shape.\nMost of this weekend's outdoor games will be played under the backdrop of sunny and dry conditions, but fans in Jacksonville may experience a shower or two during the game.\nHere is a look at the weather conditions for the Sunday and Monday night NFL games during Week 6: \n\nChicago Bears running back Benny Cunningham (30) runs to the end zone for a touchdown during the second half of an NFL football game against the Minnesota Vikings, Monday, Oct. 9, 2017, in Chicago.

He has been a featured speaker in the media industry as well as at the World Meteorological Organization, the World Federation of Scientists, and other science and business organizations worldwide. \nIn 2015, the American Meteorological Society (AMS) recognized him for his \u201coutstanding, highly principled leadership of the American weather industry over five decades.\u201d In 2016, the AMS named Myers a Fellow. \nMyers is on the Board of Directors of the American Weather and Climate Industry Association and on the board of the Weather Coalition. He has been advisor to five directors of the National Weather Service, a representative at the U.N.\u2019s World Meteorological Organization and advisor to NOAA. \nHe has vigorously supported NOAA\u2019s mission and budgets over the years in testimony before Congress, meetings with Congressional staff and Members of Congress and in support of the recently passed the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 (Public Law No: 115-25) that was signed into law by President Trump in April 2017. \nMyers received a B.S. in business administration and economics and has completed work for a master\u2019s in business management and organizational behavior (ABD) from the Smeal School of Business at The Pennsylvania State University.

Typically, storms and their impact on the Northwest ramp up during November, rather than the middle of October. \nThe storms that brought some rain and mountain snow to the region this week will likely pale in comparison to what lies ahead. \nAfter a tranquil but chilly weekend, the storms will bring rounds of drenching rain, heavy mountain snow and strong winds starting early next week. \n\"A plume of moisture is setting up across the northern Pacific Ocean,\" according to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brett Anderson. \n\"Storms are lining up like boxcars of moisture on a freight train,\" he said. \nThe bulk of the storms will focus from southern British Columbia to Washington. However, the storm track will fluctuate somewhat from north to south from storm to storm. \n\"Storms also got off to an early start in the Northwest last year,\" according to AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Meteorologist Paul Pastelok. \n\"However, unlike last year, where the storm track shifted southward and focused on California, we expect the storm train to linger in the northwestern U.S. and British Columbia much of this winter ,\" Pastelok said. \nSome heavy rain, mountain snow and gusty winds will reach as far south as Oregon and part of Northern California as the pattern progresses next week. \nRainfall from the storms could help ease the dry conditions. \nOne of the storms may drop far enough to the south to bring a chance of rain to wildfire-ravaged areas near San Francisco, Sacramento and Santa Rosa, California , later Wednesday and into Thursday of next week. \nRELATED:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T15:13:27.807+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce9afb2657008d7b8e45199f87ae2fd3a1b2147b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnhwgEchiuEDedOiQ0diiG.Byw4F25Bj3i_ywnqluQv_TRif67Dng8UYZMqsowmzuB.mcAmahZOyFdvdWQweg8gqoP553qNjDCFIZhhLAfQO1WnloRWSpYz95BQVgZ1l_r3KdRPWf3g3WEUGMM51yGLOUXcYv68bdmCBD6kyBN0NWwVCA69BPi.9n5jDagmUWucPvaRSomRiJ", "site_full": "www.accuweather.com", "site": "accuweather.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/latest", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "Weekly wrap-up: Santa Rosa area wildfire complex becomes deadliest California blaze on record", "title_full": "Weekly wrap-up: Santa Rosa area wildfire complex becomes deadliest California blaze on record", "published": "2017-10-13T15:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/v/all/img/og/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 331, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 213, "comments": 0, "shares": 213}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce9afb2657008d7b8e45199f87ae2fd3a1b2147b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnhwgEchiuEDedOiQ0diiG.Byw4F25Bj3i_ywnqluQv_TRif67Dng8UYZMqsowmzuB.mcAmahZOyFdvdWQweg8gqoP553qNjDCFIZhhLAfQO1WnloRWSpYz95BQVgZ1l_r3KdRPWf3g3WEUGMM51yGLOUXcYv68bdmCBD6kyBN0NWwVCA69BPi.9n5jDagmUWucPvaRSomRiJ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T15:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Weekly wrap-up: Santa Rosa area wildfire complex becomes deadliest California blaze on record", "text": "Email \nIntense wildfires across Northern California have killed more than two dozen people and destroyed thousands of homes. \nThe wildfire complex charring the Santa Rosa area is now the deadliest California wildfire ever, surpassing the fatalities caused by the 1991 Oakland firestorm, according to AccuWeather Meteorologist Evan Duffey. \nMore than 20,000 people have been forced to evacuate.

Published October 13, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \nThe 2017 Atlantic hurricane season has produced extreme impacts on people in the Caribbean and United States and all over the globe and have been destructive to many human settlements. There have been personal, economical and even political impacts that have emerged from this season's powerful storms. \nIn addition to impacts on dry land, hurricanes also have the potential to impact life in the water. \nWhile it is too early to tell the impacts on marine life from the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, there have been notable changes in salinity and temperature, according to Zachary Darnell, assistant professor in the division of coastal sciences at the University of Southern Mississippi. \n\u201cYou see big changes in those after you see a storm that dumps inches of rain in a given area,\u201d Darnell said. \nOne of the most significant impacts on marine life is from the massive increase of fresh water in a system, which will dramatically lower the salinity in an estuary. \n\u201cMarine animals have either specific salinity ranges that they can tolerate, or have a preference for certain salinities,\u201d Darnell said. \u201cSo if the water is too fresh they either won\u2019t survive or will move to a saltier area.\u201d \nA sea turtle named Picasso carries the ashes of Tony Amos, 80, a renowned oceanographer, on it's back as it is released back into the Gulf of Mexico following a memorial service, Saturday, Sept. 30, 2017, in Port Aransas, Texas.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay) \nDue to those changes, there is a shift in distribution of animals from the estuaries to an offshore area. Marine life that are unable to move see an increased mortality rate due to change in salinity. \nFreshwater brings sediment from runoff and erosion along with it. Marine life like oysters, barnacles and plants that are unable to move will get buried in sediment. \nSea turtles see direct impacts during hurricanes as they build their nests on beaches. Incubating eggs can be directly hit by the storm, resulting in displacement and mortality. \nAccording to experts at NOAA Fisheries, during and after hurricanes it is possible for marine mammals to enter waterways where they are not typically found. This displacement occurs as a result of storm surge and increased water levels associated with hurricanes. \nOftentimes animals will become stranded on land as a result of a hurricane. When encountering a stranded animal, NOAA Fisheries advise that the best course of action is to call a rescuer and stay with the animal until the rescuers arrive. A contact list for marine mammal rescuers around the country can be found on the NOAA website. \nThose staying with the animal should keep its skin moist by splashing water over its body, but they should also be careful to minimize contact with it. The animal should not be pushed back into the water as the mammal could be sick or injured and pushing it back to sea could result in a worsening condition. \nHurricanes can be stressful to more than just animals that dwell in the sea. According to a Duke University-led study, hurricanes affect the mortality rate of migrating birds. \nThe study tracked the migration route of the sooty tern and the path of most Atlantic basin hurricanes, finding parallels between the two. \n\u201cThe migration route overlaps both in space and in time with hurricanes and we found that there was a correlation between number of hurricanes and the mortality or deaths of the birds,\u201d said Ryan Huang, a doctorate candidate studying ecology at Duke University. \nAccording to Huang, sooty terns are more likely to die during migration when facing more hurricanes and stronger winds. Migration is a stressful process for the bird and the excess toll from a storm is likely to exhaust the bird, sometimes to the point of death. \nEvery year, over 80,000 sooty terns land at the Dry Tortugas National Park in the Florida Keys to breed from January to June. After leaving the islands, they migrate through the Caribbean and spend winter off the coast of Brazil. As the birds are usually in safe waters by August, hurricanes that occur earlier in the hurricane season pose more of a threat. \n\u201cWeak storms can also have a serious impact on birds -- its mainly about the timing, being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d \nWhile exact impacts of the 2017 hurricane season won\u2019t be known for a few more years, Huang predicts that this season will actually not have a large impact on the birds. Though there were frequent and intense storms, most storms occurred from late August and through September, while the largest concern for the birds is hurricanes that occur from June to August. \n\u201cAs storms get potentially more common, the chances of these birds being at the wrong place at the wrong time increases,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThe chances of stronger storms happening earlier in the season is likely to increase and that is a concern.\u201d Advertisement ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "huang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan huang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "picasso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony amos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zachary darnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "duke university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of southern mississippi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noaa fisheries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "caribbean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida keys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "port aransas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf of mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dry tortugas national park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T17:59:03.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5438c5effb4fc7f78d62d59638b780734c146919", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnlAaDqJYdI71RzzSFsrsNWerbDumG4rzzyibVYTOOzc3xx8qKFTR6DlDuXite_mQIcEzzyey1rPI", "site_full": "www.accuweather.com", "site": "accuweather.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/national", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "5 global cities that are climate doppelgangers", "title_full": "5 global cities that are climate doppelgangers", "published": "2017-10-13T17:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 331, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 10, "comments": 0, "shares": 10}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5438c5effb4fc7f78d62d59638b780734c146919", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnlAaDqJYdI71RzzSFsrsNWerbDumG4rzzyibVYTOOzc3xx8qKFTR6DlDuXite_mQIcEzzyey1rPI", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T17:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "5 global cities that are climate doppelgangers", "text": "5 global cities that are climate doppelgangers Published October 13, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \nDespite being separated by thousands of miles, there are many cities around the world with similar climates. \nResearchers at SaveOnEnergy.com took an in-depth look at weather patterns across the globe to highlight the unexpected climate doppelgangers. \nLos Angeles, for example, experiences a mild, temperate climate with a dry summer, much like some parts of southern Australia. \nA view of the Los Angeles skyline. (Photo/choness/Getty Images) \nTo discover cities with similar climates, researchers built a special tool that allowed them to choose a city of interest and compare it to other locations with similar climates. \nTheir interactive map, which is based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, also shows major climate types around the world along with descriptive subtypes based on rainfall pattern. \nThe K\u00f6ppen climate classification is widely used to classify the world\u2019s climates and recognizes five major climatic types, including tropical, moist climates; dry climates; moist mid-latitude climates with mild winters; moist mid-latitude climates with cold winters and polar climates. \n\u201cWe chose to look at the overall classification over the course of 100 years so we could use the locations' average climate over time,\u201d said Eric Snapper, a project manager partnered with the SaveOnEnergy.com team . \nThis interactive map allows users to enter an address or to click any location to discover places with similar climates. (Source: SaveOnEnergy.com) \n\u201cWe chose to highlight pairings with fairly substantial geographic separation to show that even with being so far apart, these locations share something in common,\u201d Snapper said. \nHowever similar the weather patterns might be for certain cities, the Northern and Southern hemispheres will always experience seasons at different times. \nBelow are five pairings of cities with similar climates, based on research findings. \n1. Perth, Australia, and Tijuana, Mexico \nThese two cities, both known for outdoor beach activities and clear, beautiful waters, are 9,389 miles apart but share regularly mild conditions and mild, hot summers. \n2. New York City, New York, and Buenos Aires, Argentina \nWith more than 5,000 miles separating these North and South American cities, it may be surprising to learn that they both experience mild conditions that are contrasted by humid and hot summers. \n3. Los Angeles, California, and Santiago, Chile \nThe K\u00f6ppen Classification data revealed that the mild conditions and warm, dry summers in Los Angeles are a perfect match for the weather conditions in Santiago, Chile. The cities are just under 6,000 miles apart. \n4. The Bahamas and Madurai, India \nIt\u2019s possible that no two climate doppelgangers could be less alike than the islands of the Bahamas and the city of Madurai, India, which have more than 9,000 miles in between them. \nDespite their differences, researchers discovered that they share similarly tropical savannas and dry winters. \n5. Toronto, Canada, and Moscow, Russia \nAlthough separated by more than 4,000 miles, Toronto and Moscow have the same snowy terrains and warm, humid summers in common. \nResearchers were surprised by most of their findings due to geographical and topographical differences between the locations. \n\u201cThe benefits here are to show something in a way that hasn\u2019t been done before and start a conversation around the subject,\u201d Snapper said. \n\u201cWe can use data like this to inform people about the climate as well as show them the similarities between places they may have never guessed shared something in common,\u201d he said. \nBased on the data, enough variations existed between climate classification over the 10-year and 30-year periods to assume that these climate siblings may not remain the same if similar research was conducted in as little as 10 years from now, Snapper said.

NAM held the meeting to discuss induced earthquakes in the Groningen gas field in the Netherlands, said Miles Wilson, a University of Durham in North East England geophysicist who collected the study's data.\nWilson and his research team were invited to provide a global overview of induced seismicity at the meeting, Wilson said.\n\nIn this April 2009 photo, mourners light up fire crackers, burn incense and make offerings to those who died in May 12, 2008 earthquake, on the grave sweeping day in Beichuan, Sichuan, China. (AP Photo/ Elizabeth Dalziel, File) \n\nInduced seismicity refers to seismic events, typically earthquakes, caused either in part or completely by human activities.\nThere are a number of human activities that are linked to induced seismicity, according to the HiQuake site.\nThe most commonly reported human activities proposed to have caused earthquakes are mining and water reservoir impoundment. In recent years, the number of earthquakes proposed to have been induced by fluid\u2010injection activities has grown.\nThe most commonly reported maximum magnitude in an induced earthquake sequence is between three and four.\nThe largest earthquake in HiQuake had a magnitude of 7.9 and occurred in China in 2008. Such large earthquakes release mostly stress of natural tectonic origin but are conceivably triggered by small anthropogenic stress changes.\n\n\nThe HiQuake database will help to improve the overall understanding of induced earthquakes and to manage their impact on society, Wilson said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to become focused on a particular earthquake, especially if it directly affects us. HiQuake, although incomplete, provides a bigger global picture than people have ever had access to before,\u201d Wilson said.\nThere is controversy surrounding cases of induced seismicity and the overall role of human behavior.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to scientifically prove that an earthquake is caused by human activity, which is why many cases are highly debated,\u201d said Wilson.\nFor example, in the United States, there has been large debate over the role of fracking for natural gas in seismic events.\n\nProtesters against fracking during a march for science Saturday, April 22, 2017, in Denver. The Mile High City is joining communities around the globe where people are marching to defend scientific work from attacks including U.S. government budget cuts. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) \n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) addresses some of the myths and misconceptions surrounding fracking and wastewater disposal.\n\"Fracking is not causing most of the induced earthquakes. Wastewater disposal is the primary cause of the recent increase in earthquakes in the central United States,\" the USGS website reads.\nFracking is more likely to induce seismic activity indirectly through the disposing of wastewater used in the process. Wastewater disposal is the byproduct of water, sand and chemicals used to hydraulically fracture hydrocarbons from rock. That high-pressure wastewater can crack rocks and lubricate faults.\nThe HiQuake data shows 29 project sites where earthquakes were induced by fracking itself, 36 sites where quakes were induced by wastewater disposal, and 12 sites where temblors induced by unspecific oil, gas, and wastewater disposal.\nThe potential risks of fracking have led to political and social debate.\n\u201cWhether or not a nation allows fracking is up to the governing body, but that decision needs to be based on scientific research and not on public perception,\u201d Wilson said.\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;section&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/section&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;section&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/section&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;section&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/section&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; \n\nQuiz Maker - powered by Riddle\nMany proposed cases of induced seismicity are controversial. When figuring out which cases to contain on the database, HiQuake decided to include all induced cases proposed on scientific grounds to the database, Wilson said.\n\u201cFiltering HiQuake using our judgment would not be a rigorous scientific method,\u201d Wilson explained. \u201cAny judgment calls we leave to users.\u201d\nHiQuake includes data drawn from publications that span almost a century. The authors estimate under-reporting to be about 30 percent for magnitude 4 events, about 60 percent for magnitude 3 events, and about 90 percent for magnitude 2 events.\nWhile it is rare for human-induced earthquakes to cause disruptions, some cases may be a significant problem, such as the hydrocarbon-producing areas of Oklahoma, according to the HiQuake abstract.\nThe potential disruptions of induced earthquakes is increasing as the size of projects and density of populations increase. Therefore, effective management strategies are needed, according to the HiQuake abstract.\n\u201cTo completely eliminate induced earthquakes, you would have to stop any human activity which influences the forces acting in the Earth\u2019s crust,\u201d Wilson said.\nThis is not practical in a world where resource demands are ever growing in response to population growth and development, Wilson said.\n\nIn this Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2011 file photo, a brine injection well owned by Northstar Disposal Services LLC is seen in Youngstown, Ohio, with the skyline of Youngstown in the distance. A dozen earthquakes in northeastern Ohio were almost certainly induced by injection of gas-drilling wastewater into the earth, state regulators said Friday, March 9, 2012 as they announced a series of tough new rules for drillers. (AP Photo/Amy Sancetta, File) \n\n\u201cHowever, the risk of induced earthquakes can be reduced by continued research into their causes and by assessing project sites as best as possible before operations commence,\u201d Wilson said.\nWilson and his research team plan to continue to keep HiQuake updated with new scientific research as it continues to evolve. NAM has recently agreed to continue funding the project for another two and half years, according to Wilson.\n\u201cWe plan to keep HiQuake as an up-to-date resource which is accessible to anyone, anywhere and at any time,\u201d Wilson said.\n\n\n\nm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "elizabeth dalziel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miles wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hiquake", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "seismological research letters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nederlandse aardolie maatschappij", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northstar disposal services llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of durham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usgs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hiquake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north east england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beichuan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "groningen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sancetta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sichuan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youngstown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mile high city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T18:52:01.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6c618c004bee9f93eb54ae48a126d15adc3a081", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnrb5gSuiolLhNS_jYtnukq4aD9K.DWShAU6up7F9VgAs4XPKNf5RXXIVJJs7KSSqEZHkSzA9afP06n9tz4spNDCwIgKfjqNrSOe4DlLYM.j85oGNH2F5qbWyCwMNwT0qsTxdGiqYwaiwpvJX3SKEC5w-", "site_full": "www.accuweather.com", "site": "accuweather.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/latest?format=xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "Devastating California wildfires predicted to cost US economy $85 billion;

strong winds will be common across British Columbia and the northwestern United States as storms roll in one after another this week. \nThe Northwest will turn stormy with a powerful jet stream setting up across the North Pacific this week, according to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Jack Boston. \nThe jet stream is a stream of fast-moving air high in the atmosphere that guides storms. \nOn average, a new storm with a resurgence of rain and strong winds will arrive on the coasts of British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest every 24 hours into the weekend. \n\u201cEach storm looks to be stronger as the week progresses,\u201d Boston said. \nAs the unsettled pattern gets into full swing this week, rainfall will become heavier and winds will become more fierce with each storm. Highway travel and airline delays will mount. \nThe first bout of wind-swept rain arriving across British Columbia on Monday will drop into Washington on Tuesday. A second storm will sweep through these areas again on Wednesday, followed by a third resurgence of stormy weather at late week. \nThe bulk of the rain and wind will pummel coastal areas. As a result, this is where the greatest risk of localized flash flooding, sporadic power outages and tree damage can occur. \nThe risk of flash and river flooding will be heightened through the week as more rain falls over increasingly saturated soil. \nThe rain will be beneficial to the region as much of the Pacific Northwest is contending with moderate drought.

At my location in the middle of Pennsylvania, the average temperature for the first 10 days of October matched the average for all of September and was only 3.8 degrees lower than for the month of August. Over the long term, the difference should be just over 15 degrees. This year's result came about because August was cooler than average and the first 10 days of October were much warmer than typical. You can see the data for my weather station (elevation: 1,400 feet) at weatherscape.com. The following map shows why cooler air is taking over for the last two days of the workweek: \nThe low pressure area will move eastward and off the East Coast allowing a cool high pressure area to expand eastward. \n2. In the meantime, the following three maps show (A) the national scene, (B) a radar composite for the Northeast this morning and (C) a forecast for Friday afternoon. \nA \nB \nCUsually with high pressure areas, we expect dry weather and sunshine. However, in this case, a high pressure area along the New England coast creates an easterly flow to its south, and that kind of flow can bring moisture in from over the ocean. The arrow on map C shows that flow. \n3. This weekend, the high pressure area should move southward as suggested by the following forecast map for Sunday afternoon. While this setup would mean there is a southwesterly flow of warm air heading into most of the Northeast, the map also shows what will lead to the next temporary cooldown next week (see arrow in the Upper Midwest).

This increased distance causes more of the blue portion of the sun\u2019s rays to scatter away from our eyes, and more of the yellow, orange and red portion of the sun\u2019s rays to reach our eyes,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Bob Smerbeck said. \nA bird dances at sunrise. (tahir abbas/iStockphoto/Getty Images) \nNot only does the yellow hue look incredible in photos, the light is also coming in at a good angle. \n\"Golden hour is great for shooting because of the direction the light comes in. The colors it produces are much more flattering than any other times of the day. It allows me to be able to backlight a subject and prevent shadows from covering the face,\" photographer Kevin Michaels said. \nPortraits and landscapes benefit the most from this special light. However, shoot into the sun for a full or partial silhouette. \nA silhouette captured during the golden hour. (Image via Instagram/kevinmichaelspix) \n\"Photographers are able to do so much more during this time, such as capturing a silhouette. This lets the photographers give clients a variety to choose from,\" Michaels said. \nThe best way to make sure you don't miss the small window of amazing lighting is to schedule your plans around the golden hour. Arrive at your shooting location beforehand to set up. \n\"Normally, I go out an hour and half before sunset so I can get a great variety of shots,\" Michaels said. \nWhen capturing portraits, warm golden light is more flattering for skin tones than harsh light. Harsh sunlight causes sharp shadows on faces and makes the model squint. \nUnlike at other times of the day, golden hour is the perfect time to have your subject almost directly facing the sun. \nPortrait of a couple using the golden hues of light. (AleksandarNakic/Vetta/Getty Images) \nGolden light also makes for great landscape pictures. The sky has more color during this time, especially if clouds are picking up the sun\u2019s rays. \nLight casts a dream-like feel onto this romantic photo. (Creative-Family/iStockphoto/Getty Images) \nThis lighting also gives the capability of extra effects like a nice flare or rim light. \nThe duration of the golden hour depends on both the latitude and season, and it changes daily. There are golden hour calculators that helps determine the time of day that will be perfect for pictures. \nA gold flare helps to set this photo apart from an average one. (Nomad/Getty Images) \nRemember, the golden hour is not during sunset or sunrise, but shortly before and after.

This is likely due to favorable weather conditions in the forecast for fire-stricken areas over the coming days. \nExperts warn that a contained fire is not an extinguished fire, and that poor air quality will continue to plague areas downwind of the blazes. \nThere are also more factors involved in fire containment efforts than one might think. \n\u201cFire containment is not only related to weather, but to manpower and resources, terrain the current fires are in and fuels available within that terrain,\u201d said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Ken Clark. \n\u201cThe weather Sunday through Tuesday was very favorable in getting a handle on the current fires,\u201d Clark said. \nWhile a few periods of rain are in store for Northern California Thursday through Friday - mainly in coastal areas north of San Francisco - a widespread, fire-quenching rainfall is not expected. \nClark also pointed out that the system bringing drenching rain to the Northwest late this week will do little more than increase the humidity and cool down California. \nAccuWeather Meteorologist Evan Duffey said these factors play an important role as well. \n\u201cRainfall is always helpful, but more so for the humidity increase than for the actual rainfall amounts,\u201d he said. \nOn Friday, wind gusts could locally reach 15-30 mph in Northern California as the system passes through. \nWhile these winds could interfere with firefighting and containment efforts, they are low compared to last week\u2019s winds and will be largely offset by the otherwise cool and relatively damp conditions. \n\u201cThere is a high chance that hot weather returns to this area of California by Monday and Tuesday, with the potential for some wind as well,\u201d Clark said. \nDuffey pointed out that \u201cthis will mean increased smoke activity, a renewal of ash fall, and the possibility of new spot fires created by the transport of burning materials.\u201d \nIt will be important for those in and near affected areas to stay up-to-date on wildfire activity, as well as local watches, warnings and air quality alerts, over the coming weeks.

Heating degree days have been down from September into the middle of October. \nA heating degree day is the number of degrees that a day\u2019s temperature drops below 65 degrees Fahrenheit, which is considered the temperature at which buildings and homes require heating. \nAhead of this cool push, rain, gusty winds and even a few thunderstorms will cross the region. \nHow heavy the rain falls and if localized flooding could be an issue will be determined by the speed of the storm and whether tropical moisture comes into play. \nAt this time, areas right along the Eastern Seaboard have the best chance of getting a thorough soaking early next week. \nDisruptions to motorists and airline passengers are projected to mount during this time. The rain and wind could knock down leaves that have yet to fall, leading to slippery spots on the roads and ruining chances to see the last of the fall foliage in some places. \n\u201cSnow can fall across the upper Great Lakes and Upper Midwest during this period, enough to lay mainly on non-paved surfaces,\u201d Pastelok said. \u201cHowever, the Great Lakes are running above normal on temperatures, and some areas away from the lakes can have heavy bursts of lake-effect snow with this colder outbreak.\u201d \nWaterspouts are even a possibility as chilly, gusty winds sweep over the Great Lakes. \nTemperatures are expected to fall to below normal levels for a time in the wake of the stormy pattern next week. \nBy the end of October, average highs range from the 40s and lower 50s in northern New England and the upper Great Lakes to the lower 60s across the Ohio Valley and the I-95 corridor of the mid-Atlantic.

Excluding the highest elevations of the Cascades, rain instead of snow will fall in all areas with this storm system. \nAdamson mentioned that some of the rain will be heavy, making flooding a concern west of the Cascades. By the end of the weekend, at least 3-6 inches of rain is forecast in Seattle and Portland, with as much as a foot of rain in the mountains. \nIn addition, howling winds lacking from the first system will kick up with this second one. \nWinds gusts of 40-50 mph will batter the coastline and can topple trees and cause power outages in areas west of the Cascades. \nMariners and fishermen will face rough seas and dangerous swells, and beach erosion may be possible as battering waves pound the coast. \nThe weather will turn more tranquil early next week as the storm track shifts into British Columbia, well north of the border. \nm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "adamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan adamson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "northwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mariners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accuweather", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yellowstone national park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spokane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cascades", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idaho", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T14:56:25.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15a2ce0cf9e718586d9c68f95919bedb08caebae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnsa04FT6P94WiprALsvz146liKlglbOJMUYyIg61Ql5M.EXKC_3bK7iXo790Vx71LQ--", "site_full": "www.accuweather.com", "site": "accuweather.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/national", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "How is the intensity of hurricane season measured?", "title_full": "How is the intensity of hurricane season measured?", "published": "2017-10-19T15:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 331, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 60, "comments": 0, "shares": 60}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "15a2ce0cf9e718586d9c68f95919bedb08caebae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnsa04FT6P94WiprALsvz146liKlglbOJMUYyIg61Ql5M.EXKC_3bK7iXo790Vx71LQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-19T15:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "How is the intensity of hurricane season measured?", "text": "Email \nAccumulated cyclone energy, or ACE, measures the strength of hurricanes and tropical storms over their duration. It allows meteorologists to compare different storms and seasons. \n\"We can classify how active a basin is for a particular season by defining the total ACE for that season plus the number of storms and major hurricanes,\" said AccuWeather Hurricane Expert Dan Kottlowski. \nGOES-16 satellite image of Hurricane Irma churning near Puerto Rico on Sept. 6, 2017. (Image/NOAA) \n\"The higher the ACE value for each storm, the stronger and potentially higher impacts it creates,\" he said. \nThe ACE value for a season in a particular region is the sum of the ACE of every tropical storm and hurricane that year. The average ACE value in the Atlantic Basic is about 92 units. An above-average season is about 111; a below-average season is 66. \nIt's only in recent history this measurement could be used for all storms, not just those that impacted land. Prior to the satellite era (before 1966), there was no way to track tropical storms that remained at sea. Once geostationary satellites were launched into the Earth's orbit in 1975, scientists had a more complete picture of the oceans to measure storms. \nThe highest ACE ever reported for a hurricane was the San Ciriaco hurricane in 1899; the lowest ever recorded was 1.2 in 1959. \nThus far in 2017, the Atlantic hurricane season has been rather active. So far, there have been three storms this year with high ACE values. Hurricanes Irma, Maria and Jose reached 66.6, 44.6 and 42.2 units, respectively. \nAccording to Colorado State University, the 2017 season has an ACE value of 223.2. Kottlowski said if there are two more storms before the end of November, that value could reach over 230 units, making it one of the most active hurricane seasons on record.

As a snowmaker for 18 years at Squaw Valley Ski Resort in Olympic Valley, California, Meyer is no stranger to bracing the elements.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t hit the hill until 27 degrees Fahrenheit,\u201d Meyer said.\nTips from this expert can help any fan spend these fall and winter seasons comfortably watching their favorite teams from the stands.\nLet food bring the heat \nBefore heading to a game or a tailgate, Meyer recommends eating a warm meal. Kelly Hogan, the clinical nutrition and wellness manager at Mount Sinai Hospital, recommends tea, coffee and soup.\n\u201cHot foods can help you feel warmer before going outside even if they don't actually raise the core body temperature,\u201d Hogan said.\nIn addition to warm foods, foods high in fats, proteins and fibers require more energy to digest and as a result actually create heat during the digestion process. Hogan recommends a three-bean chili with avocado on top or a tofu and vegetable stir fry with brown rice.\n\u201cGinger may also be able to increase thermogenesis in the body,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIncluding that in tea or in recipes is also a great idea.\u201d\n\nA Chicago Bears fan braces the cold, snowy weather during the first half of an NFL football game between the Bears and San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, Dec. 4, 2016, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) \n\nLayer up \nWhen dressing for a cold weather game, layers are essential.\nMeyer recommends a thin thermal base and a protective waterproof outer layer. A breathable under layer is important so that sweat is not trapped on the skin. Once out in the cold again, sweat will freeze and make the body colder.\nCotton should never be worn as an under layer as it is not breathable, so if sweat is produced the shirt will hold onto it and remain damp, resulting in the body getting colder.\n\u201cCotton is rotten\u201d is the golden rule on the mountain, according to Meyer, who advises never to wear cotton when spending time in the cold. When cotton dampens, the material will absorb and retain any moisture.\nIn order to remain dry, a waterproof outer layer is essential. A strong outer layer will block wind, rain and snow, ensuring no heat escapes while you stay dry.\nWhen looking for apparel to provide that long-lasting protective outer layer, Meyer recommends The North Face.\nStay active \n\u201cThe problem with a football games is you can\u2019t really get up and move around,\u201d Meyer said.\nWhile snowmaking workers are constantly active, idle fans are not doing anything to raise their body temperature.\nThis is where \u201cthe wave\u201d and other cheers show their alternative uses. If you\u2019re feeling cold at a game, stand up and get that body moving. Any excuse to be active at a game is a good one: make a bathroom trip, go for a food run or grab a hot coffee.\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to miss the game, but don\u2019t just stick to your seat,\u201d Meyer said.\nInvest in a quality pair of boots \nWhen braving a cold game, sports fans often complain about their frigid toes and feet. Most events will leave fans standing on cold concrete while rooting on their teams, leading to icy toes.\nA quality pair of boots will stave off the cold. Meyer recommended Asolo boots, which he said are surprisingly inexpensive in comparison to their great quality.\nAs important as wearing a quality pair of boots is making sure the boots are clean and breathable.\n\u201cThese boots are made to be breathable, and when they get dirty, they close up the cells in the boot material,\u201d Meyer said.\nSweat will be trapped inside the boot then make the feet cold when the temperature drops again.\nKeep extremities covered \nKeeping the body covered is the most obvious and important way to keep warm, but some parts are more principal than others.\nBlood flow to extremities is reduced when the body is exposed to low temperatures, so hands and feet are first to get cold.\n\u201cAs long as you can keep your hands and your feet warm and stay away from getting wet, then you can stay out in the cold for a long, long time,\u201d Meyer said.\nMeyer recommends thick, waterproof socks and waterproof boots.\nThe head should be covered when out in the cold as well, and it\u2019s not a bad idea to cover your face and eyes for cold and windy games, Meyer said.\n\u201cI know that guy at the football game with goggles on looks really weird, but he\u2019s actually enjoying the warmth that the goggles are giving his face,\u201d Meyer said.\nFor more safety and preparedness tips, visit AccuWeather.com/Ready .\n\nm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "meyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly hogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark meyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hogan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount sinai hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "squaw valley ski resort", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "squaw valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accuweather.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olympic valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T17:53:03.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8f03e085d41579833353092b8fb3e2690c1e8f0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnp5wtK43jjDV9t9uUlypARimy9V1o9rYnY8eKdNWUhTcFvnhIM94DQtvzXAmVFKzcrn.K.P5QV1DYTgMPKFD7j_FgGR8Q25ASDgTNPnOXc7tpMQYKgiKLN4-", "site_full": "www.accuweather.com", "site": "accuweather.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/national", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "Drenching rain, storms to mark change to autumn weather in southern US", "title_full": "Drenching rain, storms to mark change to autumn weather in southern US", "published": "2017-10-19T17:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 331, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 20, "comments": 0, "shares": 20}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8f03e085d41579833353092b8fb3e2690c1e8f0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnp5wtK43jjDV9t9uUlypARimy9V1o9rYnY8eKdNWUhTcFvnhIM94DQtvzXAmVFKzcrn.K.P5QV1DYTgMPKFD7j_FgGR8Q25ASDgTNPnOXc7tpMQYKgiKLN4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-19T17:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Drenching rain, storms to mark change to autumn weather in southern US", "text": "A brief, but major change to autumn weather in the southern United States will be accompanied by a dose of heavy rain and thunderstorms by early next week.\nA high speed river of air at the level where jets cruise at, known as the jet stream, will soon plunge southward from Canada.\nAhead of the plunge, people can expect temperatures and humidity to reach unseasonable levels this weekend although it will not be as steamy as early October.\nMoisture from the Gulf of Mexico will be thrown high into the atmosphere by the advancing cool air.

Northern California wine country of Napa, Sonoma, Solano, Lake and Mendocino counties are currently under threat from the wildfires scorching the region. \nAs of Thursday, Oct. 19, wildfires have burned over 245,000 acres across California, are responsible for at least 42 fatalities and have destroyed more than 6,900 structures, according to CalFire. \nWhile damages from the wildfires continue to be assessed, at least 57 wineries have been caught in the flames. \nA wildfire burns behind a winery Saturday, Oct. 14, 2017, in Santa Rosa, Calif. Fire crews made progress this week in their efforts to contain the massive wildfires in California wine country, but officials say strong winds are putting their work to the test. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) \nForty-seven wineries of the Napa Valley Vintners have reported some degree of damage to their vineyards and just a handful experienced significant property loss, according to a Napa Valley Vintners press release on Wednesday, Oct. 18. \nAt least three wineries in Mendocino and seven wineries in Sonoma have also reported damage, according to a Fortune article that listed wineries that have announced damages publicly. \nNorthern California experienced warm weather in late summer and early fall, which hastened the ripening process and brought about earlier-than-usual harvests. \nBoth Sonoma and Napa Valley report that about 90 percent of the grapes were picked prior to when wildfires began on Oct. 8. \nNapa Valley wineries that are able to assemble crews and safely get to their vineyards are continuing to harvest grapes. \nA sign about the recent wildfires stands in a vineyard outside the Cline Cellars winery Monday, Oct. 16, 2017, in Sonoma, Calif. With the winds dying down, fire crews gained ground as they battled wildfires that have devastated California wine country and other parts of the state over the past week, and thousands of people got the all-clear to return home. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) \nWhile there have been numerous reports highlighting the wildfire devastation to the iconic Northern California wine country, the majority of the wineries have not reported any damages. \nVineyards often act like fire breaks. This is likely the reason for why only a limited number of wineries have been destroyed or significantly damaged in the fires surrounding them, according to a recent update from the University of California at Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology. \nFurthermore, most of the grapes were harvested before the fire; therefore, the risk of smoke taint for this harvest will be limited, according to the update. \nSmoke taint occurs when there is a substantial increase in the levels of certain aroma compounds, such as free guaiacol and 4-methylguaiacol, in wine made with smoke-affected fruits. \nThese compounds are present in wood smoke and result in high levels of overpowering smoky and cold ash flavors in wine. While grapevines are very resilient and do not burn easily, grapes with heavy exposure to smoke are at risk of smoke taint, according to the update. \nDamaged wine making vats and barrels from a wildfire stand in the ruins at the production house of Paradise Ridge Winery on Tuesday, Oct. 10, 2017 in Santa Rosa, Calif.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) \n\"The risk of smoke taint increases with continual exposure or repeated exposures to heavy smoke. So any exposure to heavy smoke, has the potential to be problematic,\" the update reads. \nThere is no carry over to the next season for grapes and vineyards that were impacted by smoke taint. Although, studies are currently underway to determine the amount of smoke exposure needed to cause smoke taint. It is projected that the grapevines will fully recover if they did not actually burn, but the yield may be impacted, the UC Davis update said. \nFurthermore, there are several treatments that can reduce the effects of smoke taint, according to the update. \n\"We do not expect a significant economic impact on Northern California\u2019s wine regions due to the fact that only a small percentage of wines may be affected by the fires and smoke,\" the update reads. \nThe affected counties produce a relatively small percentage of the grapes in California. However, the wines from Sonoma and Napa are the most valuable and draw many visitors, contributing about $3.8 billion a year to economic activity. \n\"It is really, really difficult to predict what the impact might be until the wine has been made,\" Anita Oberholster, professor of Viticulture and Enology at the University of California at Davis and update contributor, told AccuWeather. \nSmoke billows from a fire burning in the mountains over Napa Valley, Friday, Oct. 13, 2017, in Oakville, Calif.

The Orionids are the first of a few strong meteor showers that occur this fall. \nThe Orionids are actually made up of debris from Halley's comet. Even though the comet only visits the inner solar system every 76 years, it left behind enough debris to produce this shower year in, year out. \nThe best time to view the Orionids is after midnight, through dawn. The Orionids will be very activte Saturday night as well, perhaps even more-so than tonight! We will update viewing conditions all weekend. \nMy best advice, if your serious about seeing meteors, is to give yourself an hour. Set yourself up in a lounge chair. Leave your phone inside. DO NOT LOOK AT ANY SOURCE OF LIGHT FOR AN HOUR, INCLUDING PHONES!! Lay back and get as much of the sky in your view as possible, and just wait. You will be guaranteed to see some if you follow these guidelines. \nAccuWeather Astronomy Facebook friend David Fisherowski spotted an Orionid meteor Thursday night. \nWe are lucking out this year. The Orionids will be occurring with no moonlight!

Waterspouts could even be a concern over the lakes, posing a hazard to boaters. \nThe cool air will not stay for an extended period in the Northeast. Temperatures are projected to quickly rebound by the last weekend of October. \nm ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul pastelok", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pastelok", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern seaboard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee river valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great lakes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mid-atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf coast", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-21T14:49:11.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6334a52f7a0c20fda0b459f26a6eca46a8a1e475", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnm_HC7FTc.HyBKo_WRtSS2lgyJJi_.z0_Ts2iCMj7sziuAJWXYJuexBzxlOvZiOyMTxd3QRAPXx3A.dZZbSZ9dYsFWs5yPuSrGZ.mcyvGYxjf8iRxaCc2EY-", "site_full": "www.accuweather.com", "site": "accuweather.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/national", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "Brisk winds to usher in much colder air across the Midwest early next week", "title_full": "Brisk winds to usher in much colder air across the Midwest early next week", "published": "2017-10-21T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 331, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 13, "comments": 0, "shares": 13}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6334a52f7a0c20fda0b459f26a6eca46a8a1e475", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwnm_HC7FTc.HyBKo_WRtSS2lgyJJi_.z0_Ts2iCMj7sziuAJWXYJuexBzxlOvZiOyMTxd3QRAPXx3A.dZZbSZ9dYsFWs5yPuSrGZ.mcyvGYxjf8iRxaCc2EY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-21T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Brisk winds to usher in much colder air across the Midwest early next week", "text": "Email \nIn what has been a very warm October across the Great Lakes and Midwest, a reality check is coming for the first part of the upcoming week. \nFor many areas it will be the chilliest stretch of weather so far this autumn, and a sharp contrast to the recent warmth. \n\u201cHigh temperatures across the Midwest will be up to 25 degrees lower on Tuesday and Wednesday than they were over the weekend,\u201d AccuWeather Meteorologist Faith Eherts said. \nGusty winds approaching 50 mph at times will keep AccuWeather RealFeel Temperatures in the 30s and 40s during the afternoon hours in many areas, especially on Tuesday. \nThe wind will be strong enough to snap some tree branches and bring down some of the fall foliage too.

atmospheric conditions have now become too hostile for tropical storm formation over much of the Atlantic basin, conditions over the western Caribbean may harbor development toward the end of October. \nThe combination of dry air, dust and strong westerly and/or southerly winds aloft will inhibit tropical storm formation over much of the Atlantic in the coming days. \nHowever, over the far southwestern end of the Atlantic basin, or the western Caribbean Sea some of the ingredients necessary to spawn a tropical depression or storm may come together late this week and during the last weekend of October. \nIn the western Caribbean, waters remain very warm and winds aloft are rather light, compared to much of the balance of the Atlantic basin, according to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski. \nThe area is one of several zones where tropical storms typically spin up during late October and November. \n\"A tropical disturbance, currently over the south-central Atlantic is scheduled to reach the western Caribbean by the end of the week,\" Pydynowski said. \"This may help spin up a tropical depression or storm.\" \nIn addition to these conditions, a non-tropical feature may join in late next week. \nThe leading edge of much cooler and less humid air, now crossing the southern United States, will push across the Gulf of Mexico this week and into the western Caribbean late in the week. \nSometimes a temperature and humidity boundary, such as this, can also help to spin up a tropical storm. \nInterests from Central America and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to Cuba, the Florida Peninsula, the Bahamas, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico should monitor the tropical weather for the potential for increasing winds, seas and gusty thunderstorms in the coming days. \nEven in lieu of a strong tropical storm or hurricane, torrential downpours produced by the disturbance and temperature boundary could unleash flooding rainfall and mudslides. \nDry air and strong winds aloft are likely to prevent such a tropical storm from moving toward the central and western Gulf coast of the United States. \nHowever, this same press of dry air may carry the threat of heavy rain and flooding toward the islands in the north-central Caribbean and the Bahamas. \nTrees stand barren in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria along a road in Montones Cuatro in the Piedrazul

"text": "Waves of chilly air to bring opportunities for snow in midwestern and perhaps northeastern US Published October 23, 2017 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \nWaves of chilly air will bring opportunities for snowflakes and accumulating snow in parts of the central and northeastern United States through the end of October. \n\"While cooler air will reach the Atlantic coast, the main thrust of chilly air and greatest chance of snow is likely over the Central states in the short term,\" according to AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Meteorologist Paul Pastelok. \nThe waves of chilly air will deliver the lowest temperatures of the season so far to many portions of the Plains and the Midwest during the next five to seven days. \nGusty winds will accompany the chilly air, especially in the Central states. \nSome frosty mornings are possible in the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, where winds are able to diminish. \nThe pattern will feature some days with highs in the 40s, or 10 to 15 degrees below average, around Chicago. \nMeanwhile, temperatures will return to seasonable levels for much of the coastal Northeast. Some frost is likely in the normally cold spots of the mid-Atlantic and New England states during the middle and latter part of the week. \nIn the swath from Boston to New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., high temperatures in the 70s will be swapped with highs in the 60s most days, starting on Wednesday. \nAs a storm wraps up and taps the chilly air, wet snow may mix with rain showers from parts of Minnesota to Wisconsin and northern Michigan from Tuesday into early Wednesday. The greatest chance of enough snow to whiten non-paved surfaces in this area will be Tuesday night. \nThe same storm may spin just enough chilly air to parts of the central Appalachians to allow a few wet snowflakes to fall along with rain showers on Wednesday and Wednesday night. \n\"While we expect temperatures to briefly rebound a bit at midweek, a second and more substantial push of cool air will follow,\" Pastelok said. \"Once again, the main thrust of the chilly air will be over the Central states and not the mid-Atlantic and New England coasts.\" \nBy late this week, parts of the central and northern Plains can expect lows in the lower to middle 20s with a hard freeze. \nThe second chilly push will cause a period of snow to spread southward along the Rockies and adjacent High Plains on Wednesday and Thursday. \nThe main storm associated with this second push of chilly air is likely to produce a swath of moderate to heavy snow much farther east. \n\"Parts of eastern North Dakota, northern Minnesota, northernmost Wisconsin and a portion of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan may be hit with several inches of snow spanning late Wednesday night to early Friday,\" according to AccuWeather Meteorologist Brett Rossio. \n\"Part of this area may receive 6 inches of snow,\" Rossio said. \nEnough snow may fall to whiten the ground around Minneapolis. \nAs the pattern continues to evolve, enough chilly air may gather with sufficient moisture to bring more doses of snow even farther east this weekend to the end of October. \nAs the second wave of chilly air settles around the lower Great Lakes this weekend, some wet snowflakes may mix with the rain showers. \nDepending on how far east the second batch of chilly air settles, it may encounter a storm along the Eastern Seaboard. \nShould these two weather features come together in a timely manner, a dose of accumulating snow could develop in parts of the central and northern Appalachians early next week, just prior to Halloween. \nThe same setup may bring a dose of heavy rain and gusty winds to coastal areas of the Northeast, perhaps more intense than that of this Tuesday. \nSo following months of unusual warmth, it seems that winterlike conditions will be creeping up on the North Central states and perhaps parts of the Appalachians during the last part of October.

(AP Photo/Wayne Parry) \n\nAnniversaries of a substantial event like Sandy can bring a recrudescence of symptoms that victims may have experienced in the immediate aftermath, said Dr. Gail Saltz, an associate professor of psychiatry at the New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine and a psychoanalyst with the New York Psychoanalytic Institute.\nDuring an anniversary, it\u2019s not unusual to feel more intense symptoms such as anxiety, sadness, sleep difficulties or appetite loss, Saltz said.\nDr. Gerard Lawson, president of the American Counseling Association, said it\u2019s not uncommon for people to have anxiety symptoms or intrusive worries where they can\u2019t shake the memories or thoughts of their original experience.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a normal reaction as your body and your mind are still sort of processing through the experience that somebody has had and we find that pretty frequently,\u201d he said.\nOngoing stress or anxiety can even manifest into physical symptoms like chronic headaches, muscle pain or stomach ailments, Gerard said.\nKaren Bromberg, of Brooklyn, New York, said Sandy caused her tremendous stress which she said contributed to a 17-pound weight gain.\nWhile Bromberg\u2019s home did not suffer damage, the same could not be said for her parents\u2019 home in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn.\nThe basement flooded significantly due to about 12 feet of water rushing down their street. With the state of the home, Bromberg said she had to put her parents in an assisted living facility and register them for Medicaid.\nAfter that, she began the arduous process of trying to sell the home. They remained in \u201cpanic mode\u201d until August 2013, almost one year later, when the house was finally sold, she told AccuWeather.\n\"[Sandy] was a really difficult time for us as a family,\u201d she said.\nLawson said one way people can cope with painful memories is to get physically active and take part in different activities around the anniversary. This allows them to reshape the experience they endured, he explained.\nIn Ocean County, New Jersey, where some of the worst damage from Sandy was inflicted, a special community anniversary event is planned.\nOn Oct. 28, residents will try to set a Guinness World Record by making sand angels on the beach in Seaside Park to commemorate the five-year anniversary and raise money for Sandy recovery as well as for victims of 2017 hurricane season.\nThese type of \u201cdoing\u201d activities show how people are programmed to respond to calls for action when they see others in need, Gerard explained.\n\u201cYou see this after large-scale events, whether they\u2019re human-caused disasters or natural disasters, people are looking for something to do. They\u2019re lining up to give blood, they\u2019re volunteering with the Red Cross and they\u2019re going out to help clear debris,\u201d Gerard said.\nIn the Ocean County town of Toms River, Michael Schwartz still sees plenty of people struggling.\nSchwartz is the president and founder of Hometown Heroes, a nonprofit and nationwide charity whose mission is to help people in crisis. Before their funding resources dried up, Hometown Heroes assisted Sandy victims with needs like security deposits, home improvements and rental assistance.\nHe said that while many homes have been rebuilt, there are still people struggling financially. Some still live in hotels five years later, he added.\n\"Most of those affected are facing devastating financial hardships due to the storm and then spiral into an emotional and mental place that seems to have no end. I didn't understand post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) fully until I saw it up close after Sandy,\" Schwartz said. \n\nAn aerial view of damage caused by the storm surge of Hurricane Sandy on the coastline of New York. Numerous houses were destroyed or damaged by the powerful storm. (FEMA Photo/Jocelyn Augustino) \n\nFor those who suffer from PTSD, there is no one-size-fits-all remedy, according to Saltz.\nSome people find it cathartic to talk through their experiences, whether it be with a trusted family member, friend or therapist. Others may prefer not to divulge their memories or feelings.

Branden Camp, File. (AP Photo/Branden Camp, File) \nWhile elevated CO 2 boosts plants\u2019 productivity by stimulating photosynthesis and causing plants to grow larger, it also increases the carbohydrates content and the ratio of carbohydrates to nutrients in plants. \nNutrients do not increase at the same rate as carbohydrates; therefore, plants end up having relatively lower concentrations of proteins and minerals in comparison to carbohydrates, according to Mathematical Biologist Irakli Loladze. \n\"For every bit of food you eat, there will be more carbs, less protein, less minerals -- zinc, iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and so on,\" Loladze said. \nLoladze was one of the first scientists to sound the alarm on the subject. \nLoladze first made this predication while doing his post-doctoral work at Princeton University in 2002. \nHowever, the process to compile the data necessary to prove his hypothesis was very slow. It took ten years to compile enough data and two years to publish the analysis of the data, Loladze said. \nIn 2014, his analysis unequivocally showed that nutrients drop and carbohydrates go up as CO 2 increases. \nBy 2016, the United States was the first country to formally acknowledge that rising CO 2 lowers the concentrations minerals and proteins in important crops and most plant species, according to Loladze. \nIt was a key finding in the 2016 U.S. report on climate change impacts on human health. It was one of the only few key findings that are high confidence due to the overwhelming amount of data. \nCory Davis examines one of the first flowers on his 760 acres of green peas east of Canyon Ferry Lake, Montana, on Monday, June 8, 2015. (AP Photo/ Alison Noon) \nAdequate food quantity is a well-known requirement for global food security, but the importance of food quality is often overlooked, a USGCRP report reads. \nIn developed nations with abundant food supplies, like the United States, the prevalence of malnutrition may not be intuitive and is often under-appreciated, according to the USGCRP. \nDeveloped nations like the United States also have the resources to supplement foods with nutrients, such as adding vitamin D to milk. \nHowever, in the U.S., it is estimated that between 38 and 45 percent of the population\u2019s diets fall below the estimated average requirements for calcium and magnesium, according to the USGCRP. \nMeanwhile, many developing nations do not have the resources to fortify their food supply with necessary nutrients to combat the declining number of nutrients in crops. This puts human nutrition at high risk. \nIn this Monday, April 11, 2016 photo, an Egyptian farmer carries his daughter in front of wheat crops on his land in Kafr Hamouda village, in Zagazig, 63 miles (100 kilometers) northeast of Cairo, Egypt. (AP Photo/Amr Nabil) \nMany nutritionists often dismiss the link between rising CO 2 and malnutrition, either because they have never heard of it or they will say it\u2019s only small drop. Many nutritionists will point out that we can always fortify our food but the fortification of food is limited in extent and scope, Loladze said. \n\"It\u2019s like saying, we can combat global warming by just turning up air conditioning in our rooms. It\u2019s a local approach to trying to solve a global problem,\" Loladze said. \nThere have been numerous studies to monitor the impact of elevated CO 2 levels on nutrient levels in crops. \nA Harvard study published online on Aug. 2 found that if CO 2 levels continue to rise as projected, the populations of 18 countries may lose more than 5 percent of their dietary protein by 2050 due to a decline in the nutritional value of rice, wheat and other staple crops. \nStudy authors estimate that roughly an additional 150 million people may be placed at risk of protein deficiency. This was the first study to quantify the risk of elevated CO 2. \nIn this photo from May. 3, 2015, a doctor attends to a malnourished child at a refugee camp in Yola, Nigeria. ( AP Photo/Sunday Alamba, File) \nAn University of Gothenburg study published in April 2017 concluded that higher CO 2 levels have significant negative effects on the nutritional value of wheat grains. \n\u201cBased on our results, we cannot yet make accurate predictions about effects on human health since people eat a lot of other things in addition to wheat-based products,\u201d study author Malin Broberg said. \nThere are numerous factors playing into how lower plant nutrition will impact human nutrition globally. There is also high uncertainty on how rising CO 2 levels will influence plant nutrition. \nThere will also be other environmental changes, such as increasing temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns, that will play a role on the impacts, said Broberg. \n\u201cConsidering that developments in agricultural practices and crop breeding are likely to happen, it is difficult to say how these factors will interact and what the resulting effect on crop quality will be,\" Broberg said. \nUSGCRP currently projects that the overall nutrient value of crops will continue to fall as CO 2 levels continue to increase over the next century.

heat will keep the wildfire danger at critical levels across Southern California this week despite winds throttling back slowly. \nTen blazes are actively burning across the state, according to Cal Fire. Since Sunday, Oct. 8, wildfires have charred over 245,000 acres and have claimed the lives of 42 people in California. \nGusty Santa Ana winds will pose challenges to fire crews into Wednesday evening as they can create erratic wildfire behavior and cause rapid growth of newly sparked blazes. \nA Santa Ana wind event will bring a strong offshore flow into Southern California with winds, especially downwind of mountain passes, exceeding 50 mph at times, according to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Jack Boston said. \n\"Gusts can reach 70 mph in some of the north- and east-facing canyons and passes in Southern California,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Jake Sojda said. \nLocalized damage and sporadic power outages can occur. Staying in driving lanes will be difficult, especially for those in high-profile vehicles. \nThe air will warm as the wind flows downhill from the mountains toward the coast.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) \nThe slackening winds on Thursday and Friday will lower the risk of wildfires rapidly spreading out of control and breaching containment lines. \nHowever, a wildfire that is intense enough can generate its own gusty winds which can cause the blaze to move in unexpected directions. \nWhile Northern California will be immune from the strongest winds this week, unseasonable warmth will persist in this part of the state as well with daytime temperatures mainly in the 80s. \nIt may take until the last days of October for cooler, more seasonable conditions to sweep across the state. No dousing rainfall is anticipated heading into early November. \nm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jake sojda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "accuweather senior meteorologist jack boston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accuweather", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa ana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gusty santa ana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "griffith park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-24T15:11:47.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "747326951bff7790fcfedea2a9f629a60576c185", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwniG3s_E7iSK4p2BullZeyfuF._jDskbOFJ.NS1s26wwOYMaFSQFMKxhJM8sc5o8TfzeXfTR9iLRXyZ_ROk_mo9larvP3ZI22Cv.iVcEtjaDngOU9QNdL389WUOmfXIg0gQJyKHkSpdWONKD.ZACF8HI-", "site_full": "www.accuweather.com", "site": "accuweather.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/national", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "Tropical system to raise risk of flooding in western Caribbean then aim for Florida, US East Coast", "title_full": "Tropical system to raise risk of flooding in western Caribbean then aim for Florida, US East Coast | Fox News", "published": "2017-10-24T19:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 331, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1527, "comments": 0, "shares": 1527}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "747326951bff7790fcfedea2a9f629a60576c185", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_LQ5fK3WQ3YXWSwoiCFAQoQG7IHj0ixcnY9VuBupEwniG3s_E7iSK4p2BullZeyfuF._jDskbOFJ.NS1s26wwOYMaFSQFMKxhJM8sc5o8TfzeXfTR9iLRXyZ_ROk_mo9larvP3ZI22Cv.iVcEtjaDngOU9QNdL389WUOmfXIg0gQJyKHkSpdWONKD.ZACF8HI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AccuWeather", "published": "2017-10-24T19:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tropical system to raise risk of flooding in western Caribbean then aim for Florida, US East Coast", "text": "Email \nA potential tropical depression or storm is likely to impact parts of the western Caribbean to the immediate Atlantic coast of the United States prior to the end of October. \nA budding tropical disturbance, currently near the coast of Nicaragua, may become the Atlantic's next tropical depression or tropical storm in the coming days. The next name on the list of tropical storms for 2017 is Philippe. \nIn the short term, conditions are favorable for slow development with the disturbance over warm waters and relatively light winds aloft, according to AccuWeather Hurricane Expert Dan Kottlowski. \nUltimately, how strong the tropical feature becomes will determine the amount of rain and wind that occurs along its path. However, even if the feature fails to become a tropical storm, enough rain is likely to fall to cause flash and urban flooding. \n\"The disturbance is likely to drift across the northwestern Caribbean into Friday, then across the Florida Straits and part of South Florida on Saturday,\" Kottlowski said. \n\"The storm is most likely to take a path parallel to the Atlantic coast of the U.S. on Sunday and Sunday night.\" \nIncreasing winds aloft and the approach of a non-tropical storm will cause the tropical feature and its rain to accelerate northward. By the time it reaches New York state and New England, it may be moving along at a pace close to 40 mph. \nWhile its fast movement may limit the storm's tropical intensity and duration of the rain, interaction with the non-tropical storm will enhance the rainfall rate and may still cause strong wind gusts. \nWhat is the timeline for the potential tropical system and its impacts? \nAs the system brews and crawls over the northwestern Caribbean, adjacent areas from Central America to southeastern Mexico, Cuba and Jamaica will be at risk for flooding downpours, locally gusty thunderstorms, mudslides and dangerous surf this week. \nAs the tropical system accelerates northward this weekend, the risk of flooding downpours and gusty thunderstorms will focus on Florida and the Bahamas on Saturday. \nHeavy rain, strong winds and the risk of flash and urban flooding will race northward from the Carolinas to the mid-Atlantic and New England on Sunday. \nIn addition to the flood risk from leaves blocking storm drains, wind gusts may be strong enough to break tree limbs and cause sporadic power outages. \nThe fast pace of the storm in the Northeast should limit the duration of any coastal flooding and beach erosion to several hours. \nThe rain and strong wind may leave areas from Washington, D.C. to Philadelphia and New York City by Monday's morning rush hour. However, if the system is a bit slower, then difficult travel and storm conditions will start the week in these areas. \nAt this time, at least the first part of Monday looks to be stormy in New England. Heavy rain and gusty winds are likely in Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia on Monday. \nRapid strengthening could lead to a different track \nThere is a chance the tropical feature quickly becomes a hurricane. Rapid development of this sort may result in a more northeasterly path toward central Cuba on Friday, then the central Bahamas on Saturday and Bermuda by early next week. \nBecause of the potential for more of an easterly track and a stronger storm, people from the central Caribbean islands to Bermuda should monitor the situation. \nm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "philippe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan kottlowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kottlowski", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "accuweather", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us east coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new brunswick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida straits", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bahamas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carolinas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quebec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mid-atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cuba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicaragua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nova scotia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bermuda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamaica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-24T18:56:50.000+03:00"}], "totalResults": 134, "moreResultsAvailable": 34, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=1eee5ef1-4d51-497e-9e88-ed86353bcda9&format=json&ts=1508860610000&q=language%3Aenglish+site%3Aaccuweather.com&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 662}
