VCG via Getty Images \nGoogle's AlphaGo may have unseated Ke Jie as the Go world champion this year, but the artificial intelligence behind AlphaGo is actually no smarter than a 6-year-old child. \nA study published Saturday showed Google's artificial intelligence technology scored best out of 50 systems that Chinese researchers tested against an AI scale they created, CNBC reported Monday. With a IQ score of 47.28, Google's AI was almost twice as smart as Apple virtual assistant Siri , which scored 23.94. \nAI systems have developed so quickly that they've been able to act as assistants , take exams and even outperform us at strategy games. But the new results may downplay the concerns of people uneasy about AI's rapid progression. \nTo evaluate how smart an intelligent system is (or has become), its ability to \"acquire, master, create and feedback knowledge\" needs to be tested, wrote the researchers. In 2014, the IQ of 50 AI systems was rated. The systems included Google's AI, Siri and Chinese search engine Baidu. Three humans, ages 18, 12 and 6, were also rated. When the researchers tested the AI systems again in 2016, they found that Google was the smartest and improved the fastest (from an IQ of 26.5 to 47.28), but it wasn't enough to beat even a 6-year-old, who came in with a score of 55.5. Now Playing: Watch this: Elon Musk warns about dangers of AI, Moto X4 leaks 1:11 \nNotable \"AI worriers\" include physicist Stephen Hawking and Tesla Motors and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who both won the 2015 Luddite Award and were branded AI \"alarmists.\" Hawking is a firm believer that AI could pose a real danger depending on who controls it and argues that it could outsmart us and end humanity . Musk agrees there's significant risk and asked for regulation in July, going as far as to suggest AI could start World War III . Alibaba founder and executive chairman, Jack Ma, predicts that companies could be helmed by AI systems in the next three decades. \nDr Lin Hsuan-Tien, chief data scientist of Taiwan-based AI startup, Appier, agrees AI systems have yet to reach the intelligence of even a six-year-old, but possess extraordinary learning capabilities. \n\"Scientists believed AI was capable of lots of things but were disappointed by failures created out of unrealistic goals,\" Dr Lin tells CNET in an email. \n\"Many AI researchers instead started to focus on 'weak AI,' which [tackles] specific problems, such as image recognition or playing the game of Go. Weak AI has proven that its ability to learn surpasses the capabilities of most human beings and is able to achieve super-human performance levels.\" \nGoogle declined to comment. \nFirst published, Oct. 3, 3:40 a.m. PT.

The funny thing is, that phrase has \"no generally accepted meaning in science,\" according to that Sept. 2016 Presidential report. \nInaccuracies in forensic science -- including bite marks, hair analysis and even in some cases fingerprints -- used in trials got wrongful convictions, some of which have been reversed thanks to DNA testing. \nSantae Tribble served 26 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit based on FBI expert testimony that claimed forensic evidence proved Tribble's hair was found at the scene of a murder. Yet when all the hairs were DNA tested, it was discovered that none belonged to Tribble, but in fact belonged to two other people and a dog. \nMicroscopic hair comparison isn't the only element of forensic science under recent scrutiny. Blood splatter patterns, footwear, firearm and bite mark analysis also has weak scientific support with the results often overstated in criminal court cases, according to last year's Presidential report. \nEven forensic scientists like Dr. Michael West -- who created a career out of being the go-to expert in bite mark identification for murder cases -- no longer believes in bite mark analysis and doesn't think it should be used in court, according to a 2012 deposition mentioned in the \"Last Week\" segment. \nOliver also points out that even when certain forensic science has been proven in reports as unreliable, judges and lawyers still use that same flawed science in trials because it has been considered admissible in previous court cases, setting precedent. \nIf judges and lawyers making decisions about what should be considered acceptable science isn't bad enough, Oliver also suggests that some forensic scientists who work closely with law enforcement could think of themselves as helping to \"catch the bad guys\" instead of remaining neutral in their findings. \nThe takeaway from Oliver's segment is that perhaps shows like \"C.S.I\" should do more to educate potential jurors about the inaccuracies in forensic science so they understand that a bite mark in a sandwich won't lead to finding a murderer. \nAt the end, Oliver suggests an idea for a much more realistic forensic TV show \"CSI: Crime Scene Idiot\" starring Josh Charles, Shannon Woodward, Josh Lucas, Bobby Burke, and Samira Wiley. \nTech Culture : From film and television to social media and games, here's your place for the lighter side of tech. \nSpecial Reports : CNET's in-depth features in one place.

The headphone is comfortable to wear, but it's not as light or quite as comfortable as Bose's QuietComfort 35 II . \nLike earlier wireless Bowers & Wilkins headphones, the PX comes with a quilted carrying case and a cable for listening in wired mode so you can plug into an in-flight entertainment system. It's worth noting that this headphone charges via USB-C, not Micro-USB and its battery life is rated at 22 hours with wireless and noise cancelling turned on. That number is right there with the battery life of competing models from Bose, Sony and Beats. \nAs for the integrated controls, I like how the middle multifunction button is raised higher than the volume controls, which lets you operate the remote -- it's on the right ear cup -- by feel alone. \nThe PX with its carrying case, headphone cord and USB-C charging cable. Sarah Tew/CNET Multiple noise cancelling settings \nOverall, B&W's adaptive noise cancelling isn't quite as strong as the noise cancelling on the Bose QC35 II. But using the free companion app for iOS and Android devices you can toggle through three modes of noise cancellation based on the environment you're in. The modes include office, city and flight. \nTo maximize sound quality, you can turn off noise cancelling altogether in the app or push a button on the right ear cup to toggle it on or off (however, there's no voice assistant to let you know it's off, you just have to sense it). Another option is to adjust the level of pass-through sound so you can better hear people talking, and B&W promises that the headphones will add features and improve over time through software updates. The other feature worth highlighting is the auto-pause/auto-resume feature: If you pull an ear cup off your ear, your music pauses and then resumes as soon as you put the ear cup back on your ear. During my short initial test period, the feature worked almost flawlessly and the headphones wireless Bluetooth performance was generally very solid. I also thought the headphone worked well as a headset. Bowers & Wilkins PX Same drivers as high-end P9 \nThe PX's drivers are the same angled drivers previously found in Bowers & Wilkins high-end P9 headphone , and that angled design is supposed to create a \"more convincing soundstage,\" according to the company. \nOverall, I did think the PX sounded pretty open for a closed-back headphone and it had good clarity and was natural sounding in the midrange (and pretty natural sounding overall). The bass goes deep but I wouldn't say it's super-punchy or super-highly defined. In other words, there's some warmth to the headphone, which means it lacks a little sizzle, but that's not necessarily a bad thing; it's just the way the headphone sounds. Note: The sound signature is fixed, with no EQ settings available in the app, which I personally don't mind. \nI've only been listening to the PX for a few days, so I'm not ready to give it a final rating yet. But my initial impression is that while it doesn't blow away the competition from Sony, Bose and Beats, it does sound excellent for a wireless noise-cancelling headphone and is a strong contender in this price class. \nClose-up of the integrated remote and noise-cancelling on/off button just next to it. Sarah Tew/CNET \nI'll have a more fleshed out comparison to the Bose QC35 II, Sony WH-1000XM2 and the Beats Studio3 Wireless in the coming weeks. In the meantime, here are the PX's key features, according to Bowers & Wilkins: With built-in sensors, the headphones will switch on immediately and automatically resume playing your music; put them down and they return to stand-by mode. Lift an ear cup to talk, or hang them around your neck, and PX will pause the music, resuming playback when you're ready to listen. PX has three adaptive noise cancelling modes via a companion app for iOS and Android: \"City\" allows through traffic noise for safety purposes; \"Office\" allows through voices so you can hear colleagues when they talk to you; \"Flight\" cancels ambient engine noise. The app also enables firmware updates for additional feature upgrades. The 40mm drive units feature the same angled design found on the P9 (the drivers are the same as the P9's). aptX HD Bluetooth technology for devices that support aptX. 22 hours of playback in wireless noise cancellation mode, 33 hours in wired noise cancellation mode. Available now in two colors: space gray and soft gold with blue trim.

Google could also debut a possible premium version of Google Home and maybe even a Google Home with a screen .\nWhile I like the idea of Google expanding its smart speaker lineup, I want to see Google announce a smart home product that's not just another version of an Amazon Echo device. Google Home was obviously inspired by the similar Amazon Echo , and the Google Home Mini should replicate the Echo Dot . A Home with a screen would line up with the Echo Show , and a more powerful premium version of the Home could remind customers of the Echo Plus as well as Apple's upcoming HomePod . \nGoogle has done an admirable job of developing its current Home speaker. Even though the Echo is two years older, Google Home now has a comparable number of smart home partners and abilities . That said, to truly bring the Home out of Amazon 's shadow, Google needs to stop chasing Amazon and surprise us with a unique device of its own. \nThe thrill of the chase Last week, Amazon announced six new products in the Echo family , including the Echo Plus and a smaller Echo with a screen . Even as Google Home has largely caught up with the Echo in terms of features, Amazon leads in device versatility, especially after its announcements last week. \n19 Just look at all of Amazon's new Alexa devices While it's arguable that Amazon now has too many Echo devices , the company deserves credit for continuing to find new, useful ways to package Alexa , Amazon's digital assistant. For example, the Echo Show lets you use Alexa to make video calls, and the Echo Look turns Alexa into a fashion adviser. \nOn top of Amazon's first-party devices, other companies have used Alexa's open API to build the technology into an even wider variety of gadgets . GE has an Alexa lamp . LG built Alexa into a fridge . Google's own voice assistant, dryly called the Google Assistant , is only available in speakers and phones for now. \nBut Google has taken steps to change that, launching a developer kit for Assistant this spring . Still, we're just now seeing third-party products launch with Assistant , and so far, they're only speakers and phones. It's perfectly reasonable for creative new devices to take time to surface with only a few months for development, but in the meantime Amazon keeps adding devices to its lead. \nAccording to Droid Life, this is a leaked pic of the Google Home Mini.\nDroid Life In terms of sales, Echo devices are way ahead of the Google lineup. Amazon accounts for 70 percent of smart speaker sales, with Google a distant second, according to eMarketer. The $50 Echo Dot (\u00a350, unavailable in Australia) is Amazon's bestseller. The Dot packs the full power of Alexa into a small, affordable package. Plus, it plugs into your house's stereo system so you can use Alexa to play music on your speaker of choice.\nWe loved the Dot when we reviewed it, and last spring, I argued that Google needed a competitive device -- a smaller, more affordable Google Home that mainstream customers can scoop up without too much consideration. It certainly looks like Google will deliver that on Wednesday with the Google Home Mini. \nIf the Mini does exist, and if it's good, it'll be an important part of Google's smart home lineup and could help the search giant catch up to Amazon in smart speaker sales. So the Mini is a necessary move by Google, but it's still the move of a company playing catchup. \nGoogle could keep imitating Amazon's successful products, but if it wants to capture more than just a slice of the other 30 percent of the market, Google needs to forge a new trail for its Assistant. Fortunately for Google, there are still a few fertile areas remaining where Google can beat Amazon to the punch. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Playing: Watch this: How to center your smart home around your Google Home 1:36 What else is there? At the top of my wish list for a surprise device would be a Google router with the Google Assistant built in. Google already has a router called Google Wifi , which uses three identical units that you can spread out to create a Wi-Fi \"mesh\" signal throughout your home. \nThe Echo took a piece of familiar hardware -- a speaker -- and made it feel fresh by adding Alexa and microphones so it would respond to voice commands. Google could do the same thing with a device most of us need to have anyway. \nWhat we expect on Wednesday Previewing the Google Pixel 2 event Mini Google Home speaker could be on its way Premium Google Home A microphone-equipped, multiunit Google Wifi package would distribute Google Assistant access all around your home. Better yet, a Google Home version of Google Wifi would add some excitement to an ordinary but necessary device, not unlike what Nest did for the thermostat. \nA television that doubled as a Google Home would also break new ground, and like the router, it could bring the Assistant into your life via a consumer electronic device you might plan to purchase regardless.\nAmazon doesn't have an Alexa-enabled router, but it does technically have an Alexa-enabled TV: the Element Fire TV . But the Element isn't voice-activated itself (neither are the upcoming model from Toshiba or the comparable models from Westinghouse and Sony ). You can pair the Element with any Echo device to control it with your voice, or you can press a button on the TV's remote to give a command.\nAs it stands, Google will add Assistant capabilities to existing Android TV devices later this year. Like Amazon, Google has streaming boxes running the company's software. A few companies such as Sony also make TVs with Android TV built in . Like the Element TV with Alexa, the Sony TVs still require you to push a button on your remote to talk to the TV. \nThe next step seems simple: add a few microphones to one of those Sony TVs and you'll have a TV version of the Google Home. In practice, adding microphones to a TV in a spot where you're not reducing screen size and they can still hear you over the sound of the television could be difficult. One way around this could be building an always listening microphone into the TV's remote, but that would certainly put strain on the remote's battery. \nSo a Google Home TV might not be easy to make, but it would be cool, useful and unique. \nWaiting for Google 43 Here's everything that works with Google Home Google has a lot of the pieces already in place to build the Assistant into something new and to step out of Amazon's shadow. Google makes routers and has TVs with the company's software built in. Making one of those double as a Google Home would provide useful functionality and a dose of coolness to tech we already use. \nThe devices Google is likely to unveil on Wednesday will continue to replicate the Echo line. The competition between Google and Amazon on the smart speaker front is a good thing for consumers, as the companies push each other to add more features and functionality. For the sake of that competition, I hope Google surprises us with a broader variety of Assistant-equipped devices, and soon.\nGoogle Pixel 2 lands Oct. 4, here's what we know : Every fact, rumor and leak we've seen about the new phone so far.\n'Alexa, be more human' : Inside Amazon's effort to make its voice assistant smarter, chattier and more like you.\nCNET Smart Home reading \u2022 Google Home needs a surprise to step out of Alexa's shadow Oct 5 \u2022 Google's Home Max vs. Apple's HomePod vs. Amazon's Echo Plus Oct 5 \u2022 How does the Google Home Mini compare to the Amazon Echo Dot?

Thorne, Barry C. Barish and Rainer Weiss. N. Elmehed/Nobel Media \nThe Nobel Prize for physics has been awarded to three scientists who proved Einstein right by observing gravitational waves. \nRainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish and Kip S. Thorne worked on the collaboration between the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), a collaborative project with over 1,000 researchers from more than 20 countries, and its European sister facility Virgo. They were given the prize \"for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves.\" \nA visualisation of the gravity waves caused by two black holes merging. Henze/NASA \nThe LIGO first observed signs of gravitational waves on 14 September 2015. The faint signal was initiated 1.3 billion years ago by a collision between two black holes. Albert Einstein predicted these waves as part of his general theory of relativity, which he developed over a century ago. \nEinstein was doubtful that these ripples through space and time could ever be detected, but LIGO has observed two similar events since the first discovery. And a new gravitational wave was observed by the LIGO and Virgo teams on 14 August this year. \n\"Gravitational waves are an entirely new way of following the most violent events in space and testing the limits of our knowledge,\" the The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , which awards the prize, said in a statement on Tuesday. \n\"This is something completely new and different, opening up unseen worlds.

Sign Up 650,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SUVs recalled The 2011-2014 model-year SUV campaign centers on improperly installed brake booster shields. Dodge @cpautoscribe \nFiat Chrysler Automobiles is recalling 646,394 examples of its 2011-2014 Dodge Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs in the US to inspect brake booster shields. \nAccording to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration notice , corrosion may develop within the brake booster owing to a water leak, a condition that can limit braking performance. Apparently, shields designed to protect the booster may may have been incorrectly installed during a fix from a previous campaign in 2014. That's right -- this is a recall stemming from a previous recall. \nIn an official statement , FCA noted that \"A booster compromised by water will still deliver brake function in compliance with US federal safety standards. However, customers may experience excessive brake-pedal firmness.\" The automaker says that a booster problem telltale could include activation of the vehicle's antilock brakes or illumination of a warning lamp. \nJeep's 2011-2014 Grand Cherokee is being recalled over brake booster shields. Jeep \nFCA says it is aware of a single accident that may be related to the brake booster shield problem, but notes that the incident in question did not result in any injuries. \nDealerships will inspect vehicles under this campaign and remedy improperly installed shields and/or the boosters themselves as needed, free of charge. \nAn additional 42,304 vehicles in Canada and 21,139 in Mexico are also affected by this recall campaign.

Surely Siri should be compared to other virtual assistants, such as Microsoft's Cortana, Amazon's Alexa, Samsung's Bixby and of course Google's nameless virtual assistant.\nThe virtual assistant is not the artificial intelligence engine... it is typically the interactive channel through which each company employed its AI to facilitate ease of use and access to a very limited number services. Each company has taken a unique approach in deciding of its services could benefit from a virtual assistant without getting in the way of what the user is trying to do.\nThe virtual assistants offer a thin slither of functional overlap through which one might be able to compare the underlying AI that powers the assistants (such as search)... but this is not enough to fully evaluate the maturity, completeness and usefulness of the underlying AI technology, especially if one company is focused on using AI to solve specific problems that are not a priority for others - for example, Samsung claims that Bixby's purpose is to help the user maximise the value that they derive from using their Samsung galaxy device by automating tasks on the actual handset that would otherwise be too complex for most casual users. As high end feature rich smartphones have increasingly become more complex for most consumers, this is a noble, albeit limited, purpose for the Bixby virtual assistant; but it also means that rating the maturity of Samsung's AI on the basis of how well Bixby is able to accomplish tasks that Google's assistant might excel at would be unreasonable.\nJust my 2 cents worth.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:10:45.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7165bb555e938b1c88f892245fb996ed5db365a4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQPbtVHNHUoAlOaLzuL6hUBIUVy9CupiCeFR7IO2KOfrnXVKmUT3l_1LIyVAJd8R2SLkzgzl_0oSIDF8_fi6N9RDqX5U6L1cPpR6CUo9eWHBLSZFCd8UUsw", "site_full": "www.cnet.com", "site": "cnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.cnet.com/rss/all", "site_categories": ["shopping", "media", "cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "CNET", "title": "Google's AI is no smarter than a 6-year-old, study says - CNET", "title_full": "Google's AI is no smarter than a 6-year-old, study says - CNET", "published": "2017-10-03T11:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/ItWEXQ23NHBoH9_QCxbf0cXfBBA=/2017/10/03/77c2310c-ec0d-4ae4-b401-a9397926cc16/kejie-vs-alphago.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 164, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fce54fdf6000831f3ddb143727fd48788596d3b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQPbtVHNHUoAlOaLzuL6hUBIUVy9CupiCeFR7IO2KOfrnXVKmUT3l_1LIyVAJd8R2SLkzgzl_0oSIDF8_fi6N9RDqX5U6L1cPpR6CUo9eWHBH3UNEZAuAEr4rv6upZRNf8-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "DaveKinley", "published": "2017-10-03T15:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "I think, that at present, a block of cheese is more intelligent than Siri", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:10:45.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5460c687c4710f399aea3169c9eec2fc6b15914d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQPbtVHNHUoAlOaLzuL6hUB_MzDxWeDI9oYO1bPZ4noQpM37cwRbpy1ZlbxbYWfQrkhihk.1C_mXw--", "site_full": "www.cnet.com", "site": "cnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.cnet.com/rss/all", "site_categories": ["shopping", "media", "cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "CNET", "title": "This is your chance to win* an SNES Classic!

Roku's higher end 4K streamers start with he stick plus which can also handle HDR and the Roku Ultra which also sports an ethernet port and micro SD expansion slot. All of the new Roku products will hit on October 8. Google is doing away with the controversial demotion policy for sites that present users with paywalls. Lindberg reports that the search giant will no longer penalize such sites in search results, and instead work on ways to improve subscriptions to news sites, starting with the New York Times and the Financial Times. And finally, Sony is giving Playstation VR a minor update Adding a connection for stereo headphones directly into the visor and allowing for each of the arch pass through in the hardware processing box. The updated units will arrive in stores soon and will stay at the same price. Unfortunately, current PSVR owners need to update if they want to do HDR pass through.

It costs $400, \u00a3330 or AU$549. \nThe PX feels quite sturdy and I liked how its memory foam-equipped, elliptical-shaped ear cushions adhere magnetically and are easily replaceable (although there's no word yet on how much replacement ear pads will cost). The headphone is comfortable to wear, but it's not as light or quite as comfortable as Bose's QuietComfort 35 II . \nLike earlier wireless Bowers & Wilkins headphones, the PX comes with a quilted carrying case and a cable for listening in wired mode so you can plug into an in-flight entertainment system. It's worth noting that this headphone charges via USB-C, not Micro-USB, and its battery life is rated at 22 hours with wireless and noise cancelling turned on. That number is right there with the battery life of competing models from Bose, Sony and Beats. \nAs for the integrated controls, I like how the middle multifunction button is raised higher than the volume controls, which lets you operate the remote -- it's on the right ear cup -- by feel alone. \nThe PX with its carrying case, headphone cord and USB-C charging cable. Sarah Tew/CNET Multiple noise cancelling settings \nOverall, B&W's adaptive noise cancelling isn't quite as strong as the noise cancelling on the Bose QC35 II. But using the free companion app for iOS and Android devices you can toggle through three modes of noise cancellation based on the environment you're in. The modes include office, city and flight. \nTo maximize sound quality, you can turn off noise cancelling altogether in the app or push a button on the right ear cup to toggle it on or off (however, there's no voice assistant to let you know it's off, you just have to sense it). Another option is to adjust the level of pass-through sound so you can better hear people talking, and B&W promises that the headphones will add features and improve over time through software updates. The other feature worth highlighting is the auto-pause/auto-resume feature: If you pull an ear cup off your ear, your music pauses and then resumes as soon as you put the ear cup back on your ear. During my short initial test period, the feature worked almost flawlessly and the headphones' wireless Bluetooth performance was generally very solid. I also thought it worked well as a headset for calls. Bowers & Wilkins PX Same drivers as high-end P9 \nThe PX's drivers are the same angled drivers previously found in Bowers & Wilkins' high-end P9 headphone , and that angled design is supposed to create a \"more convincing soundstage,\" according to the company. \nOverall, I did think the PX sounded pretty open for a closed-back headphone and it had good clarity and was natural sounding in the midrange (and sounded pretty natural overall). The bass goes deep but I wouldn't say it's super punchy or super highly defined. In other words, there's some warmth to the headphone, which means it lacks a little sizzle, but that's not necessarily a bad thing; it's just the way it sounds. Note: The sound signature is fixed, with no EQ settings available in the app, which I personally don't mind. \nI've only been listening to the PX for a few days, so I'm not ready to give it a final rating yet. But my initial impression is that while it doesn't blow away the competition from Sony, Bose and Beats, it does sound excellent for a wireless noise-cancelling headphone and is a strong contender in this price class. \nClose-up of the integrated remote and noise-cancelling on/off button just next to it. Sarah Tew/CNET \nI'll have a more fleshed out comparison to the Bose QC35 II, Sony WH-1000XM2 and the Beats Studio3 Wireless in the coming weeks. In the meantime, here are the PX's key features, according to Bowers & Wilkins: With built-in sensors, the headphones will switch on immediately and automatically resume playing your music; put them down and they return to stand-by mode. Lift an ear cup to talk, or hang them around your neck, and PX will pause the music, resuming playback when you're ready to listen. PX has three adaptive noise cancelling modes via a companion app for iOS and Android: City allows through traffic noise for safety purposes; Office allows through voices so you can hear colleagues when they talk to you; Flight cancels ambient engine noise. The app also enables firmware updates for additional feature upgrades. The 40mm drive units feature the same angled design found on the P9 (the drivers are the same as the P9's). aptX HD Bluetooth technology for devices that support that standard. 22 hours of playback in wireless noise cancellation mode, 33 hours in wired noise cancellation mode. Available now in two colors: space gray and soft gold with blue trim. The price is $400, \u00a3330 or AU$549.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bowers", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bowers & wilkins", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bowers & wilkins px", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnet", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bowers & wilkins px same", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "px", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usb-c", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:26:27.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7165bb555e938b1c88f892245fb996ed5db365a4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQPbtVHNHUoAlOaLzuL6hUBIUVy9CupiCeFR7IO2KOfrnXVKmUT3l_1LIyVAJd8R2SLkzgzl_0oSIDF8_fi6N9RDqX5U6L1cPpR6CUo9eWHBLSZFCd8UUsw", "site_full": "www.cnet.com", "site": "cnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.cnet.com/8300-17918_1-85.xml", "site_categories": ["shopping", "media", "cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "CNET News", "title": "Google's AI is no smarter than a 6-year-old, study says - CNET", "title_full": "Google's AI is no smarter than a 6-year-old, study says - CNET", "published": "2017-10-03T11:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/ItWEXQ23NHBoH9_QCxbf0cXfBBA=/2017/10/03/77c2310c-ec0d-4ae4-b401-a9397926cc16/kejie-vs-alphago.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 164, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "afadda9740d1a0bf4d8bd0d5d8354b71aa6605c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQPbtVHNHUoAlOaLzuL6hUBIUVy9CupiCeFR7IO2KOfrnXVKmUT3l_1LIyVAJd8R2SLkzgzl_0oSIDF8_fi6N9RDqX5U6L1cPpR6CUo9eWHBH3UNEZAuAErGf.3.2D6a8g-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "coal686", "published": "2017-10-03T17:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "Wait, so I skimmed the paper to see what was actually tested.

This one was designed to stay put.\nGather 'round, kids, and let me tell you what life was like way back in the 90s. Back then -- and I know this because I worked for a mail-order computer company (which was a thing) -- it was a pretty big deal when you could buy a 250MB internal hard drive for $250. That's megabytes , people.\nToday, for a limited time and while supplies last, Best Buy has the Seagate Backup Plus 4TB external USB 3.0 hard drive for $69.99 shipped (plus tax). That's terabytes , people.\nAre. You. Freaking. Kidding. Me?\nFour terabytes for $70! (It's regularly $130.) Personally, I don't know what a person does with 4TB nowadays, though I can certainly speculate: video editing/storage, multiple full-system backups, maybe a big library of FLAC-encoded music. If you use a certain DVR service to save movies and TV shows for offline viewing, a drive like this would hold a lot of movies and TV shows. And all those videos you're shooting with your phone, but don't actually have room for on your phone? Offload them to this.\nAs you might expect from the name, the Backup Plus was built with archiving in mind. It comes with software that can automate the process while also preserving media you've shared on sites like Facebook and Flickr. Thanks to the USB 3.0 interface, it should prove plenty fast at transferring files.\nEnlarge Image \n\nWiley The drive comes with a two-year warranty and has a 4.7-star average rating from Best Buy customers. \nYour thoughts?\nBonus deal: Coding is a highly marketable skill. Ready to learn? For a limited time, TradePub is offering the ebook edition of Wiley's \"Coding for Dummies\" for free -- in exchange for some personal/company information. Price you'd pay at Amazon for the Kindle version: $16.\nThe 255-page book covers all the basics of writing code and hooks you up with online exercises. It has a 4.3-star rating from Amazon buyers.\nAs with all TradePub giveaways, you do have to supply some information about yourself, where you work and so on.

This is especially true if you're back at work where naps are hard to come by. \nMore sleep is what the Snoo Smart Sleeper promises to give you for $1,160. Pre-baby, I might have been deterred by the price tag. But now I know how sleep deprivation has taken a serious toll on my life, and I think differently. \nWhat's so special about the Snoo? The Snoo was created by pediatrician Dr. Harvey Karp. In the parenting world, he's renowned for his baby-whisperer superpowers. His book, \" The Happiest Baby on the Block ,\" and the companion DVD gives parents the \"5 S\" approach to soothing a newborn: swaddle, side or stomach position, shush, swing and suck. His methods are based on the notion that the first three months of life are more like a fourth trimester of pregnancy in which the baby still needs to feel like he or she in the womb. \nKarp's approach was the basis for the bassinet. He worked with MIT Media Lab trained engineers and designer Yves B\u00e9harto turn his 5 S method into a device that mimics the womb by using technology to swaddle, swing and shush babies back to sleep.\nHow it works It may look like a fancy bassinet, but the Snoo is full of tech, from top to bottom. It has three microphones, a speaker and two motors that create different rocking motions. \nTo turn on the Snoo, you have to swaddle the baby in one of the Snoo's sleep sacks and clip the sack into the sides of the bassinet. This is to ensure that your baby won't roll over in the middle of the night. Once the baby is in place, you start the Snoo with a button on the base or with the Snoo iOS or Android app on your phone. This will initiate a gentle rocking motion and a soft white noise that sounds like rainfall. \nWhen the baby starts to cry, the microphones signal the motors to intensify the movement and the speaker to change the white noise to a higher frequency that's supposed to help calm the baby. It will continue to bump up to the next level until level four. Once the Snoo has comforted your baby, the bassinet will slowly decrease to the default level. If your baby is hungry or has a dirty diaper and continues to cry past level four, the Snoo will shut down and send you a notification alerting you that your baby needs attention. \nThe Snoo companion app allows you to control the bassinet remotely even when you're not connected to the same Wi-Fi, which is helpful once the baby is sleeping in his own room. \nYou can get away with not using the Snoo app and rely on the button, but it's nice to have control over the levels and settings. The app also allows you to lock the Snoo at a certain level, set a limit on the maximum level reached and adjust the sound sensitivity. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Playing: Watch this: A sleeping baby with the push of a button 2:03 I've been testing the Snoo with our baby, Samuel, from the moment we came back from the hospital in mid-May. We've used it mostly at night and just recently for naps. \nEarly days The first six weeks were a blur as my husband and I tried to figure out how to care for a newborn. Since most newborns need to feed every two to three hours (even at night), there wasn't much the Snoo could do to get us more sleep than those short bursts. What it did give us, however, was peace of mind. I'd have nightmares in those early days about all the possible ways he could die in his sleep. The fact that he was on his back clipped in with no other objects in his crib gave me more confidence as a new parent. \nWhat we learned Get a back-up Snoo sack and mattress cover for leaks and blow-outs. The Snoo comes with three different-sized sacks and a fitted sheet, but that wasn't enough for Samuel. Diaper leaks meant we were up in the middle of the night blow-drying the Snoo sack and the sheet so we could put him back down. Once we ordered more, the late-night blow-drying got better. \nAlso, if you're worried about the intensity of the rocking motion, you can limit the levels on the app. I opted to have it max out at level two for the first two months. \nEnlarge Image \nFirst spotted at CES 2017, the Snoo comes with everything you need including 3 of the sleep-sacks for your baby. \nSarah Tew/CNET Months 2-3 After the initial chaos, I started to notice the perks of having the Snoo. Putting Samuel down at night and after late-night feedings was way easier. When I put him down in his \"dumb\" bassinet, I had to rock him with my hand on his chest for at least 15 minutes just to coax him into sleep, which seems like an eternity at 3 a.m. The Snoo did the work for me. Most nights, it would rock him back to sleep in the time it would take me to get back from the bathroom. And I'm pretty sure he'd sleep for a longer stretches in the Snoo. But since his sleep was so varied, there's no way for me to know for certain. \nWhat we learned Samuel is a loud sleeper, he groans and lets out little wails throughout the night. Most nights they were loud enough to wake me up, but not loud enough to activate the next level on the Snoo. Once we increased the sound sensitivity on the Snoo, it would pick up sooner, which meant he would calm down faster and make less noise. I still couldn't sleep through that first wail, but at least I didn't feel like I had to run to his side right away. \nThe four-month sleep regression We were inching closer and closer to that eight-hour sleep stretch when we hit month four, which coincided with my return to work. And let me tell you, the four-month sleep regression is no joke. Samuel started waking up every at least four times a night again. Not even the Snoo could keep him down. But I'm pretty sure it would be 10 times a night without the Snoo. \nWhat we learned You can lock the Snoo on a higher level to help soothe him faster during the four month sleep regression when they start waking up more often. That and loading him up on milk before bedtime helped us prolonge the first stretch of sleep. \nThe last months and transition to the crib The Snoo sticks with you and your baby until he or she is 6 months old. Then, your baby will have transition into a traditional crib. The app has a \"transition\" mode that turns off the motion on the Snoo once the baby is calm to help ease him or her out. And the large sleep sack has an arms-out option to help transition him or her out of the swaddle. \nWe're still trying to survive month four, so stay tuned for the transition update in a few months. \nIs it worth it? \nIf the Snoo gets you more sleep and peace of mind during those brutal early months, and you can afford it, absolutely! It hasn't given us a full night's sleep yet, but it's definitely given us more sleep, which is more than most parents can ask for. But there's no guarantee that it will have the same effect on your baby. So if you think it may help your little one, give it the 30-day trial. The most you can lose is more sleep.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sam", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "samuel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey karp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karp", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnet", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:23:11.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba8ad8fdf293f4d870ef56226e0beb902606ef56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQPbtVHNHUoAlOaLzuL6hUBxlo7VChGx6gIuzbme3az9h7wPb1DZCycZsWSa2EdQ6ok5bj_pZox.A--", "site_full": "www.cnet.com", "site": "cnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.cnet.com/rss/all", "site_categories": ["shopping", "media", "cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "CNET", "title": "Google Pixel 2 event: Livestream, start time, how to watch", "title_full": "Google Pixel 2 event: Livestream, start time, how to watch - CNET", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/khj4PvpyhiB61UA-6NR8fTSxrJo=/670x503/2017/10/02/c8499c66-b053-4412-bba5-0b65eb097073/evan-blass-pixel-2-no-case-diagonal.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 164, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 175, "comments": 0, "shares": 175}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 71}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ba8ad8fdf293f4d870ef56226e0beb902606ef56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQPbtVHNHUoAlOaLzuL6hUBxlo7VChGx6gIuzbme3az9h7wPb1DZCycZsWSa2EdQ6ok5bj_pZox.A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Pixel 2 event: Livestream, start time, how to watch", "text": "Phones Google Pixel 2 event: Live blog and livestream here Pixel 2 phones, Google Home Mini and Home Max smart speakers and a \"Pixelbook\" laptop are just some of the products Google is rumored to unveil. by October 4, 2017 8:59 AM PDT Close CNET Live Drag \nApple unveiled its new iPhones on Sept. 12 .

Google could also debut a possible premium version of Google Home and maybe even a Google Home with a screen .\nWhile I like the idea of Google expanding its smart speaker lineup, I want to see Google announce a smart home product that's not just another version of an Amazon Echo device. Google Home was obviously inspired by the similar Amazon Echo , and the Google Home Mini should replicate the Echo Dot . A Home with a screen would line up with the Echo Show , and a more powerful premium version of the Home could remind customers of the Echo Plus as well as Apple's upcoming HomePod .\nGoogle has done an admirable job of developing its current Home speaker. Even though the Echo is two years older, Google Home now has a comparable number of smart home partners and abilities . That said, to truly bring the Home out of Amazon 's shadow, Google needs to stop chasing Amazon and surprise us with a unique device of its own.\nThe thrill of the chase Last week, Amazon announced six new products in the Echo family , including the Echo Plus and a smaller Echo with a screen . Even as Google Home has largely caught up with the Echo in terms of features, Amazon leads in device versatility, especially after its announcements last week.\n19 Just look at all of Amazon's new Alexa devices While it's arguable that Amazon now has too many Echo devices , the company deserves credit for continuing to find new, useful ways to package Alexa , Amazon's digital assistant. For example, the Echo Show lets you use Alexa to make video calls, and the Echo Look turns Alexa into a fashion adviser.\nOn top of Amazon's first-party devices, other companies have used Alexa's open API to build the technology into an even wider variety of gadgets . GE has an Alexa lamp . LG built Alexa into a fridge . Google's own voice assistant, dryly called the Google Assistant , is only available in speakers and phones for now.\nBut Google has taken steps to change that, launching a developer kit for Assistant this spring . Still, we're just now seeing third-party products launch with Assistant , and so far, they're only speakers and phones. It's perfectly reasonable for creative new devices to take time to surface with only a few months for development, but in the meantime Amazon keeps adding devices to its lead.\nAccording to Droid Life, this is a leaked pic of the Google Home Mini.\nDroid Life In terms of sales, Echo devices are way ahead of the Google lineup. Amazon accounts for 70 percent of smart speaker sales, with Google a distant second, according to eMarketer. The $50 Echo Dot (\u00a350, unavailable in Australia) is Amazon's bestseller. The Dot packs the full power of Alexa into a small, affordable package. Plus, it plugs into your house's stereo system so you can use Alexa to play music on your speaker of choice.\nWe loved the Dot when we reviewed it, and last spring, I argued that Google needed a competitive device -- a smaller, more affordable Google Home that mainstream customers can scoop up without too much consideration. It certainly looks like Google will deliver that on Wednesday with the Google Home Mini.\nIf the Mini does exist, and if it's good, it'll be an important part of Google's smart home lineup and could help the search giant catch up to Amazon in smart speaker sales. So the Mini is a necessary move by Google, but it's still the move of a company playing catchup.\nGoogle could keep imitating Amazon's successful products, but if it wants to capture more than just a slice of the other 30 percent of the market, Google needs to forge a new trail for its Assistant. Fortunately for Google, there are still a few fertile areas remaining where Google can beat Amazon to the punch.\nNow Playing: Watch this: How to center your smart home around your Google Home 1:36 What else is there? At the top of my wish list for a surprise device would be a Google router with the Google Assistant built in. Google already has a router called Google Wifi , which uses three identical units that you can spread out to create a Wi-Fi \"mesh\" signal throughout your home.\nThe Echo took a piece of familiar hardware -- a speaker -- and made it feel fresh by adding Alexa and microphones so it would respond to voice commands. Google could do the same thing with a device most of us need to have anyway.\nWhat we expect on Wednesday Previewing the Google Pixel 2 event Mini Google Home speaker could be on its way Premium Google Home A microphone-equipped, multiunit Google Wifi package would distribute Google Assistant access all around your home. Better yet, a Google Home version of Google Wifi would add some excitement to an ordinary but necessary device, not unlike what Nest did for the thermostat.\nA television that doubled as a Google Home would also break new ground, and like the router, it could bring the Assistant into your life via a consumer electronic device you might plan to purchase regardless.\nAmazon doesn't have an Alexa-enabled router, but it does technically have an Alexa-enabled TV: the Element Fire TV . But the Element isn't voice-activated itself (neither are the upcoming model from Toshiba or the comparable models from Westinghouse and Sony ). You can pair the Element with any Echo device to control it with your voice, or you can press a button on the TV's remote to give a command.\nAs it stands, Google will add Assistant capabilities to existing Android TV devices later this year. Like Amazon, Google has streaming boxes running the company's software. A few companies such as Sony also make TVs with Android TV built in . Like the Element TV with Alexa, the Sony TVs still require you to push a button on your remote to talk to the TV.\nThe next step seems simple: add a few microphones to one of those Sony TVs and you'll have a TV version of the Google Home. In practice, adding microphones to a TV in a spot where you're not reducing screen size and they can still hear you over the sound of the television could be difficult. One way around this could be building an always listening microphone into the TV's remote, but that would certainly put strain on the remote's battery.\nSo a Google Home TV might not be easy to make, but it would be cool, useful and unique.\nWaiting for Google 43 Here's everything that works with Google Home Google has a lot of the pieces already in place to build the Assistant into something new and to step out of Amazon's shadow. Google makes routers and has TVs with the company's software built in. Making one of those double as a Google Home would provide useful functionality and a dose of coolness to tech we already use.\nThe devices Google is likely to unveil on Wednesday will continue to replicate the Echo line. The competition between Google and Amazon on the smart speaker front is a good thing for consumers, as the companies push each other to add more features and functionality. For the sake of that competition, I hope Google surprises us with a broader variety of Assistant-equipped devices, and soon.\nGoogle Pixel 2 lands Oct. 4, here's what we know : Every fact, rumor and leak we've seen about the new phone so far.\n'Alexa, be more human' : Inside Amazon's effort to make its voice assistant smarter, chattier and more like you.\nCNET Smart Home reading \u2022 Google Home needs a surprise to step out of Alexa's shadow Oct 5 \u2022 Google's Home Max vs. Apple's HomePod vs. Amazon's Echo Plus Oct 5 \u2022 How does the Google Home Mini compare to the Amazon Echo Dot?

The figures were among the data Facebook shared with Congress over concerns the ads may have influenced the 2016 presidential election.\n\"Most of the ads appear to focus on divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum, touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights,\" Schrage wrote. \"A number of them appear to encourage people to follow Pages on these issues.\"\nThe revelation comes nearly a month after Facebook said it identified about 500 \"inauthentic accounts\" that bought $100,000 worth of ads that targeted highly politicized social issues such as immigration, guns and LGBT rights. Facebook has sent records of the ads to government investigators looking into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.\nFacebook's disclosure marked a new turn in the high-profile Russia investigation, which has raised issues concerning President Donald Trump 's election last year, the involvement of his children and the actions of his staff. At issue is how much the Russian government may have attempted to influence the electorate, and whether Trump or anyone working for him was knowingly involved. Trump has repeatedly denied involvement.\nSchrage revealed that some of the ads were paid for in Russian currency, but said that alone wasn't an effective way of identifying suspicious behavior.\n\"The overwhelming majority of advertisers who pay in Russian currency, like the overwhelming majority of people who access Facebook from Russia, aren't doing anything wrong,\" Schrage wrote. \"We did use this as a signal to help identify these ads, but it wasn't the only signal.\nFor its part, Silicon Valley is coming to grips with how much its services may have been used to sway the election. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg , who at first downplayed the impact the social network may have had on the spread of false news, has now embraced those concerns and is working to address them . Those efforts include working with news organizations to identify false news, and shutting down advertising access to accounts that repeatedly spread it.\nSpecial Reports : All of CNET's most in-depth features in one easy spot.\nIt's Complicated : This is dating in the age of apps.

This one was designed to stay put.\nGather 'round, kids, and let me tell you what life was like way back in the 90s. Back then -- and I know this because I worked for a mail-order computer company (which was a thing) -- it was a pretty big deal when you could buy a 250MB internal hard drive for $250. That's megabytes , people.\nToday, for a limited time Best Buy has the Seagate Backup Plus 4TB external USB 3.0 hard drive for $69.99 shipped (plus tax). That's terabytes , people.\nAre. You. Freaking. Kidding. Me?\nFour terabytes for $70! (It's regularly $130.) Personally, I don't know what a person does with 4TB nowadays, though I can certainly speculate: video editing/storage, multiple full-system backups, maybe a big library of FLAC-encoded music. If you use a certain DVR service to save movies and TV shows for offline viewing, a drive like this would hold a lot of movies and TV shows. And all those videos you're shooting with your phone, but don't actually have room for on your phone? Offload them to this.\nAs you might expect from the name, the Backup Plus was built with archiving in mind. It comes with software that can automate the process while also preserving media you've shared on sites like Facebook and Flickr. Thanks to the USB 3.0 interface, it should prove plenty fast at transferring files.\nEnlarge Image\nWiley The drive comes with a two-year warranty and has a 4.7-star average rating from Best Buy customers.\nYour thoughts?\nBonus deal: Coding is a highly marketable skill. Ready to learn? For a limited time, TradePub is offering the ebook edition of Wiley's \"Coding for Dummies\" for free -- in exchange for some personal/company information. Price you'd pay at Amazon for the Kindle version: $16.\nThe 255-page book covers all the basics of writing code and hooks you up with online exercises. It has a 4.3-star rating from Amazon buyers.\nAs with all TradePub giveaways, you do have to supply some information about yourself, where you work and so on.

They are now marketing themselves with the alias Mint SIM.\nCustomer service is actually a Philippine call center hired to answer calls to create the appearance of legitimacy. They lack the training or authority to resolve any problem.\nUltra/Mint SIM gives new meaning to fly by night. They have no fixed place of business and neither own nor lease a physical location. Instead, Ultra/Mint uses mail receiving services as their addresses.\nThe company has no phone number other than the Philippine call center. They go to great lengths to ensure no one can reach them and take privacy to a whole new level.\nMany people have complained about the unrealistic coverage map. The actual phone service, and coverage map, is provided by T-Mobile.\nUnfortunately, T-Mobile publishes very dishonest coverage maps designed to create the false impression T-Mobile has a national network like ATT or Verizon. T-Mobile subsidiary MetroPCS has more realistic coverage maps.\nT-Mobile will eventually expand coverage using 600 MHz spectrum purchased from TV stations. No current phone supports that frequency so you will need a new phone. LG announced the new V30 will support this band in the future.\nUltra/Mint SIM needs money. They are soliciting customers to pay for one year in advance. If the company collapses, customers lose their money and phone number. If you insist on using Ultra/Mint SIM, I encourage you to port your number to a VOIP service like Google Voice to access your number without the risk of losing it.\nThere are many competing companies with real customer service that don't require you to pay a year in advance.

However, customers may experience excessive brake-pedal firmness.\" The automaker says that a booster problem telltale could include activation of the vehicle's antilock brakes or illumination of a warning lamp.\nEnlarge Image\nJeep's 2011-2014 Grand Cherokee is being recalled over brake booster shields.\nJeep FCA says it is aware of a single accident that may be related to the brake booster shield problem, but notes that the incident in question did not result in any injuries.\nDealerships will inspect vehicles under this campaign and remedy improperly installed shields and/or the boosters themselves as needed, free of charge.\nAn additional 42,304 vehicles in Canada and 21,139 in Mexico are also affected by this recall campaign.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/49ayXiVIZyUAuTxK6PxuQGeyLzM=/0x0:2997x2324/2017/10/03/0d026f2f-31ed-4d7b-8585-e02047502135/2011-jeep-grand-cherokee-overland.jpg", "https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=17V572000&refurl=rss", "http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=18599&mid=1"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "dodge durango", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fiat chrysler", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeep fca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national highway traffic safety administration", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "durango", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:53:34.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "babd8f1357f829931a475a00e76c2fe34c52a3b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.irEX7KvLpUF7iUCIbdJPksEIJirvn1Vb4Of7W6h9XdLBU_wNJ.sQ_G9xr1JfWmIcAQ4lSEcQ.DCkiplT6bdpM4fa9I3puFb1onSeqPJ8ZFw--", "site_full": "www.cnet.com", "site": "cnet.com", "site_section": "http://reviews.cnet.com/car-tech-blog/", "site_categories": ["shopping", "media", "cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "New cars, car reviews and pricing - Roadshow by CNET", "title": "This future dashboard knows if you're talking on the phone", "title_full": "This future dashboard knows if you're talking on the phone - Roadshow", "published": "2017-10-03T10:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/PvAj4YITqUYZ6W8a_TZdr0L505M=/2017/10/03/5b687e3c-0506-441f-a629-1c08c396850d/ceatec-2017-day-01-89-of-283.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 164, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "babd8f1357f829931a475a00e76c2fe34c52a3b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.irEX7KvLpUF7iUCIbdJPksEIJirvn1Vb4Of7W6h9XdLBU_wNJ.sQ_G9xr1JfWmIcAQ4lSEcQ.DCkiplT6bdpM4fa9I3puFb1onSeqPJ8ZFw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T10:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "This future dashboard knows if you're talking on the phone", "text": "Believe it or not a major challenge in the development of autonomous cars is not enabling the car to figure out what's going on around it, but finding a way for the car to figure out what's happening inside it. Specifically, cars will need to determine whether the driver behind the wheel is alert and paying attention to the road. For the near-future of autonomy, at least, cars won't be able to drive themselves 100 percent of the time, so the driver will need to take control should something unforeseen happen.\nMany auto manufacturers are addressing this issue in many ways, including retinal scanners that can tell where you're looking and heart-rate monitors that can tell if you're getting a bit sleepy. At this year's CEATEC 2017 in Japan, component manufacturer Omron was showing off an implementation of a series of sensors that take that detection to the next level.\n8 Omron's dashboard knows when you are sleeping Omron's latest solution, an improvement over last year's , includes the eye monitoring and sleepiness detection that we've seen in the past, but adds a few new flavors to the mix. For one thing, its infrared scanners can see through sunglasses, meaning even if your future is looking particularly bright the car will still be able to tell whether your eyes are open.\nAdditionally, the future dashboard can tell if you're holding a phone up to your head and talking on it. This, of course, is illegal most places these days and is grounds for deeming that you're of questionable alertness.\nShould you drive the car in a non-alert state, or perhaps fall asleep while the car is in autonomous mode, the car will attempt to warn you before, eventually, pulling itself over.
