Bobby Jindal (R) and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum (R). \nBut before the race even started, two potential names took themselves out of the running. ADVERTISEMENT Ronald (Ron) Harold Johnson Senate Dems hold floor talk-a-thon against latest ObamaCare repeal bill Sen. Cassidy plans to bring down Medicaid Senate committee schedules hearing on health care block grants MORE (R-Wis.) was suggested by Heritage Action, but he told reporters late Monday that he was not interested in the job. \nAnd one name that surfaced over the weekend, Sen.

The former health-care consultant was a key figure in efforts to repeal the law this year, making frequent trips to Capitol Hill to try to win over wavering lawmakers. \nShe is also close to Vice President Pence. Verma worked on putting a conservative twist on Indiana\u2019s Medicaid program while Pence was governor. \nGottlieb would be seen as a more pragmatic choice, signaling that fighting ObamaCare might not be front and center. \nA doctor, Gottlieb is best known for his work on drug policy. He worked at the FDA under President George W. Bush and also was a scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. \nHe has steered clear of partisan controversies so far at the FDA and has been relatively press friendly, with frequent tweets and speeches. \nAnother name floated, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin David Jonathon Shulkin The Hill's 12:30 Report David Shulkin: Invictus Games showcase healing power of sports Trump adviser drafted resignation letter after Charlottesville: report MORE , would also be a less partisan choice. \nA holdover from the Obama administration, he was confirmed as VA secretary by a 100-0 vote earlier this year. But he is now facing his own controversy over taxpayer-funded flights after The Washington Post reported the government paid for a flight to Europe for him and his wife, where he combined business meetings with sightseeing. \nThe conservative group FreedomWorks, meanwhile, is pushing for Jindal. A former presidential candidate, Jindal has a long background in health care, serving in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the George W. Bush administration, and is a strong opponent of ObamaCare. \nAs a candidate, he touted his plan for replacing the health-care law. \nBut one hurdle is his past disparagement of Trump. In 2015, Jindal called Trump an \u201cunstable narcissist.\u201d \nAny nominee is sure to face a tough confirmation process. \nSenate Democrats have been warning about the \u201csabotage\u201d of ObamaCare at HHS so far, including a 90 percent cut to the advertising and outreach budget that encourages people to enroll in the health insurance marketplace. \nDemocrats plan to seek commitments from a nominee about how they would carry out ObamaCare, according to a Senate Democratic aide. \nIt is possible that Trump might not even nominate a replacement anytime soon. The president has not nominated a new Homeland Security secretary since the post became vacant in July. \nA delay would leave acting Secretary Don Wright, who vaulted from obscurity into the position with Price\u2019s resignation, in place for the near future. \nWright, a doctor, was a career official in the department, serving under both Bush and President Obama. His background is in public health, a less partisan area in contrast to the battles over ObamaCare. \nJoseph Antos, a health-care expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said the failure of GOP efforts to repeal ObamaCare has taken some of the luster out of the HHS position. \n\u201cThe job is not the same job that one might have imagined in February,\u201d Antos said. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be legislation.\u201d \nInstead, the job will be more focused on regulations, which Antos said can be \u201creally tedious stuff.\u201d \nAntos said that reality might scare off more high-profile contenders. \nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott (R) is often mentioned as a possible nominee. He is the former CEO of a hospital company. \nBut he is a considering a run for Senate in 2018. And a spokesman said Monday that Scott \u201chas no plans to pursue\u201d the HHS position. \nHousing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson Benjamin (Ben) Solomon Carson The Federal Reserve is setting America up for economic disaster Baltimore's failing schools are a tragedy of criminal proportions The US can grow its own farm workers MORE , famous for his work as a neurosurgeon, is also a possibility, but he told Trump in November that he was not interested in the HHS job. \nMichael Leavitt, a former HHS secretary under Bush, wrote in an email that the next secretary has the opportunity to use administrative actions to shift ObamaCare in a rightward direction. \n\u201cThis is a powerful tool, and while not providing the political victory the President and Congress promised, it could, nonetheless, make constructive changes consistent with Republican ideology,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe selection may provide insight on whether the President sees that opportunity.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom price", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:32:49.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "940a9a7b04cfcc2ddd37aa294687a20a26a86914", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc54vxH_7Z7LdAQ4yrHAx4TzVL9IPtitPGxdaE61TDABjfdJJBf4dunhowkvateF1VVdaJyN9zDuFRUvuh035Qy9.vb0xjCCinQY3TxcdLO98U3T2UpBEW.h8-", "site_full": "thehill.com", "site": "thehill.com", "site_section": "http://drudgereportfeed.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "Drudge Report Feed", "title": "GOOGLE critic takes on tech giants...", "title_full": "GOOGLE critic takes on tech giants...", "published": "2017-10-03T14:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/lynnbarry_092217gn_lead.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1472, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "940a9a7b04cfcc2ddd37aa294687a20a26a86914", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc54vxH_7Z7LdAQ4yrHAx4TzVL9IPtitPGxdaE61TDABjfdJJBf4dunhowkvateF1VVdaJyN9zDuFRUvuh035Qy9.vb0xjCCinQY3TxcdLO98U3T2UpBEW.h8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T14:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "GOOGLE critic takes on tech giants...", "text": "Google critic takes on tech giants By Harper Neidig - 10/03/17 06:00 AM EDT 2 \u00a9 Greg Nash Barry Lynn has been pushing the government to crack down on corporate power for 16 years, but his ideas never received as much attention as when they cost him his job at a Google-sponsored think tank. \nAfter parting ways with New America over the summer, Lynn has launched a new independent group to raise awareness about the threats posed by corporate giants. \nLawmakers are increasingly willing to confront tech leaders on a growing list of issues, and Lynn\u2019s transition comes as authorities are investigating whether Russians used Google, Facebook and Twitter to sow division during last year\u2019s election. \n\u201cI think people are understanding just how poorly structured these institutions are, how sloppily they were built,\u201d Lynn tells The Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of the fact that these people have too much power, it\u2019s also that they are sloppy in the use of their power.\u201d ADVERTISEMENT Lynn\u2019s argument found the spotlight in August, when The New York Times reported that he and his Open Markets team had been ousted from New America after clashing with Anne-Marie Slaughter, the think tank\u2019s president. Slaughter was angry about a statement Lynn had issued praising the European Union\u2019s decision to hit Google with a record $2.83 billion fine for antitrust violations.\nAccording to the Times, Google, one of the think tank\u2019s biggest funders, had complained to Slaughter about the statement, leading to her firing Lynn and his team of scholars. Slaughter has disputed the Times story, insisting that the decision to part ways with Open Markets had nothing to do with Google. \n\u201cNew America chose to part ways with Mr. Lynn because he couldn\u2019t work with his colleagues in respectful, honest and cooperative manner,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill. \u201cNew America is a growing, dynamic and diverse organization of over 200 staff and fellows who work on a wide variety of important issues. Just 12 percent of our funding comes from corporate sources, and at no time would any funder be allowed to dictate the intellectual beliefs of our organization.\u201d \nGoogle has also denied trying to get Lynn fired. \nStill, the episode has given new momentum to Lynn\u2019s view that the power held by tech giants constitutes a threat to Americans\u2019 political and economic liberty. These companies have effectively taken control of the ways in which people communicate, Lynn argues, without any real checks on their power. \n\u201cPerhaps the most pressing thing of all is that Google, Facebook and to certain degrees also Amazon have captured the flow of information and ideas between citizen and citizen,\u201d Lynn said. \n\u201cOur ability to communicate freely with one another in this country, which is the primary basis for being able to protect our democracy, is now threatened in very real ways today,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is not a theoretical threat; this is a threat that exists today.\u201d \nIn a shared office space a block away from the White House, Lynn spoke with The Hill about the new independent think tank he\u2019s launched, called the Open Markets Institute, and the group\u2019s mission to change how the country thinks about competition policy. \nLynn and his team of scholars have been arguing that the approach to antitrust enforcement in vogue for decades has led to massive corporate consolidation, which in turn is responsible for corrupting the nation\u2019s politics, increasing wealth inequality and stifling innovation fostered by genuine competition. \nSince the 1980s, antitrust policy in the U.S. has largely drawn from what\u2019s known as the Chicago School, which holds that competition regulators should focus on how consumers are impacted by issues like pricing when deciding whether to take action against a company. The new antitrust movement argues that framework is too narrow and that regulators also need to take into account a company\u2019s effects on its competition. \nBefore antitrust policy became the focus of his career, Lynn covered the rise of globalization as a journalist. In 1984, he began working for wire services covering political crises in Peru and Venezuela. He later edited the magazine Global Business, and it was there that he began studying the effects of corporate consolidation. \nThe turning point came in 1999, after a devastating earthquake in Taiwan killed 2,400 people. What surprised Lynn was that the earthquake also took a toll on the American economy. The burgeoning tech industry at the time had been relying on Taiwan for imported computer components to the extent that U.S. factories were forced to shut down days after the earthquake hit. \nThat a single event in a faraway country could have such severe ripple effects domestically made Lynn wonder why the system was set up in a way that exposed it to such risks. \n\u201cSo I just became fascinated with this event, understanding this event and what it meant and how we got a point of putting all of our eggs in one basket,\u201d he said. \u201cDid people in the White House understand this? Did people in [the Defense Department] understand this? Did people in Treasury understand this?\u201d \nThe focus on concentration led him to study antitrust policy, and in 2001 he took a fellowship with New America to focus on the issue. In 2010, he began expanding the Open Markets team and taking on the role of an editor, overseeing its efforts to raise awareness about corporate concentration through investigative journalism, historical analysis and research. Lynn says the independent Open Markets team will be run much the same way, spurning the traditional think tank model. \nMany Washington think tanks are staffed by policy analysts who are in between government jobs, and Lynn says that they spend much of their time at those institutions learning how to write in a way that helps them sell their ideas to a larger audience. \n\u201cWhen New America was created, the idea was to flip that on its head and bring in really smart young reporters and editors and thinkers and academics \u2014 people who already know how to write, know how to tell stories \u2014 and get them to see themselves as policy people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have an idea, and they\u2019re not ashamed about pushing an idea out.\u201d \nLynn thinks that building a staff around those principles will be his biggest challenge as he works to get the organization off the ground. He said that he and his team have no use for economists because \u201canyone who was trained in an economics program has been trained in the wrong way to work with us.\u201d \nOpen Markets has eight people on staff, counting Lynn. They include Matt Stoller, a researcher and former congressional aide, and Lina Khan, who as a law student at Yale University unsettled the tech world with a paper advocating antitrust action against Amazon earlier this year. Heading up the group\u2019s advocacy efforts is Sarah Miller, a veteran Democratic staffer who\u2019s worked for John Podesta, Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton Biden slams Trump over golf gif hitting Clinton Overnight Cybersecurity: Equifax hit by earlier hack | What to know about Kaspersky controversy | Officials review EU-US privacy pact Overnight Tech: Equifax hit by earlier undisclosed hack | Facebook takes heat over Russian ads | Alt-right Twitter rival may lose domain MORE and the Treasury Department. \nLynn and his team have been encouraged by the reception they\u2019ve gotten from lawmakers, even if the Trump administration hasn\u2019t shown much interest in their work. Lynn said that given the \u201cchaos\u201d in the White House, their best hope for their ideas to catch on is to partner with members of Congress, grass roots organizations and state attorneys general. \nAnd though the acrimonious break with New America has undoubtedly boosted his new organization\u2019s profile, Lynn says he\u2019s not interested in rehashing the controversy and said he has nothing but the \u201cgreatest respect\u201d for Slaughter. \n\u201cThis is a huge problem in America,\u201d he said, \u201cand we are just completely overwhelmed by the interest in our work from people on the Hill, from people in academia, from people in Europe, from people in the press. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on. We\u2019re not looking back.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harper neidig", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "greg nash barry lynn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt stoller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton hillary diane rodham clinton biden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john podesta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lynn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lina khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anne-marie slaughter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaspersky", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "open markets institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global business", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yale university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:37:12.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb06091b132dc6611349ceea8768a03370f13857", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc56ivB84J7ei2kNO44.Ou6ICpzeQF.XaYEhEXsuDIX01_SN_4r5EK4jg77quWYg1M3S5_GkEhrP22QdVgc04LbIMlLM6tRMRxVrvLaL2IO763", "site_full": "thehill.com", "site": "thehill.com", "site_section": "http://drudgereportfeed.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "Drudge Report Feed", "title": "GOP establishment doubts Bannon primary powers...", "title_full": "GOP establishment doubts Bannon primary powers...", "published": "2017-10-03T14:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bannon_092617getty.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1472, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb06091b132dc6611349ceea8768a03370f13857", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc56ivB84J7ei2kNO44.Ou6ICpzeQF.XaYEhEXsuDIX01_SN_4r5EK4jg77quWYg1M3S5_GkEhrP22QdVgc04LbIMlLM6tRMRxVrvLaL2IO763", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T14:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "GOP establishment doubts Bannon primary powers...", "text": "GOP establishment doubts Bannon\u2019s primary powers By Ben Kamisar - 10/03/17 06:00 AM EDT 350 \nEstablishment Republicans are skeptical that former judge Roy Moore\u2019s victory in last week\u2019s Alabama GOP primary runoff means that an alliance of insurgent conservative groups, led by former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon, is about to knock off more Republican incumbents. \nBannon and his allies have used Moore\u2019s Tuesday night victory over the establishment-backed Sen. Luther Strange Luther Johnson Strange Moore laments racial division between 'reds and yellows' Corker pressed as reelection challenges mount Trump to visit Alabama in support of Strange MORE (R-Ala.) as a springboard to float challenges against a fleet of Republican incumbents. Bannon and his allies see the wind at their backs after a unified and high-profile push, arguing that the win means that no incumbent is safe. ADVERTISEMENT But some establishment Republican strategists aren\u2019t buying it. They argue that the influence Bannon and his Breitbart News outlet had on Moore\u2019s victory is overblown and that the unique set of circumstances that won Alabama won\u2019t be easily transferable to other primary challenges across the country.\n\u201cMoore was leading this race long before Bannon got involved and he won this race for reasons that have nothing to do with Bannon\u2019s involvement,\u201d said Alex Conant, a strategist who worked on Sen. Marco Rubio Marco Antonio Rubio Overnight Defense: Senate passes 0B defense bill | 3,000 US troops heading to Afghanistan | Two more Navy officials fired over ship collisions Senate passes 0B defense bill Trump bets base will stick with him on immigration MORE \u2019s (R-Fla.) presidential campaign. \n\u201cThere were a lot of extenuating circumstances that made it difficult for Sen. Strange to win.\u201d \nThe Alabama race hinged on several factors that are unlikely to reappear the next time Bannon tries to take out a GOP incumbent. \nFor one, Strange had been appointed to the seat temporarily by then-Gov. Robert Bentley (R), who later resigned in disgrace and pleaded guilty to charges related to an alleged affair. Critics blasted Strange, the state\u2019s former attorney general, for accepting the appointment even as his office investigated Bentley, opening Strange up to accusations he won the seat through a corrupt deal with Bentley. \nMoore also had a unique popularity with Alabama\u2019s evangelical GOP voters, thanks to his role in two controversial court showdowns \u2014 one ordering him to remove a Ten Commandments statue he commissioned from public land and one over the federal Supreme Court\u2019s decision legalizing same-sex marriage. \nA post-election memo from the Senate Leadership Fund (SLF), the super PAC aligned with Senate GOP leaders that spent millions on Strange\u2019s behalf, points to both of those factors as keys to Moore\u2019s victory. \n\u201cThe massive resources that independent groups can deploy in races tend to obscure the paramount importance of candidate quality,\u201d read the memo from SLF President Steven Law. \n\u201cMoore is a folk hero with rural religious voters who admire Moore\u2019s intransigent stands on displaying the Ten Commandments and bucking the U.S. Supreme Court on gay marriage. ... Most critically, Strange was dogged by his appointment to the Senate by disgraced former Gov. Robert Bentley.\u201d \nThe memo, first obtained by The New York Times, also downplays the role of Bannon and Breitbart, as well as its own impact on the race. It adds that Moore was uniquely suited for a low-turnout special election campaign that relied on an enthusiastic base of supporters, a dynamic that will be hard to reproduce in other states\u2019 primaries. \nBannon plans to replicate Moore\u2019s success in other Republican Senate primaries with the same coalition of right-wing groups and personalities. In Alabama, Bannon and Breitbart joined forces with the pro-Trump Great America Alliance super PAC as well as Wayne King, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows\u2019s (R-N.C.) political adviser, to rally grass-roots support for Moore on the ground. \nThat support included a flurry of rallies over the final days of the campaign that featured appearances by Bannon, as well popular faces on the insurgent right such as 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin and \u201cBrexit\u201d architect Nigel Farage. \nMoore\u2019s victory energized Bannon and his allies. Bannon introduced Moore at his victory party and went on in the days after the race to position the Alabama win as just the start of the conservative backlash to GOP incumbents.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ben kamisar", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bannon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alex conant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven law", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marco rubio marco antonio rubio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigel farage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luther strange luther johnson strange moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bentley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wayne king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert bentley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah palin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark meadows", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "breitbart", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gop", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "senate gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pro-trump great america alliance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "breitbart news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "slf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house freedom caucus", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:37:13.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "73609d3b6f17ce6dcf255e03329fd765ef1c9cc5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc56ivB84J7ei2lzGFSiicKPNKdPM9RStOLYOu48uIHnqrzCl2lUjPGkfshCHtron3DqMfb4OJHAzEN9h4V7i7RfKpGV4I.q4fKjNBlfUe0kaOwT4wkJHeO6c-", "site_full": "thehill.com", "site": "thehill.com", "site_section": "http://conservativeangle.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "Conservative Angle", "title": "Bannon: Trump pivot to left on gun control \u2018impossible\u2019", "title_full": "Bannon: Trump pivot to left on gun control \u2018impossible\u2019", "published": "2017-10-03T15:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Conservative-Angle-Logo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1472, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "73609d3b6f17ce6dcf255e03329fd765ef1c9cc5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc56ivB84J7ei2lzGFSiicKPNKdPM9RStOLYOu48uIHnqrzCl2lUjPGkfshCHtron3DqMfb4OJHAzEN9h4V7i7RfKpGV4I.q4fKjNBlfUe0kaOwT4wkJHeO6c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EdJenner", "published": "2017-10-03T15:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bannon: Trump pivot to left on gun control \u2018impossible\u2019", "text": "Bannon: Trump pivot to left on gun control \u2018impossible\u2019 By Mallory Shelbourne - 10/03/17 07:14 AM EDT 11 \u00a9 Getty \nFormer White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon reportedly said it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for President Trump to move to the left on gun control following the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas, adding that it would be the \"end of everything.\" \n\"Impossible: will be the end of everything,\" Bannon said in a text to an Axios reporter when asked if he could see the president supporting restrictions.

Slaughter was angry about a statement Lynn had issued praising the European Union\u2019s decision to hit Google with a record $2.83 billion fine for antitrust violations.\nAccording to the Times, Google, one of the think tank\u2019s biggest funders, had complained to Slaughter about the statement, leading to her firing Lynn and his team of scholars. Slaughter has disputed the Times story, insisting that the decision to part ways with Open Markets had nothing to do with Google. \n\u201cNew America chose to part ways with Mr. Lynn because he couldn\u2019t work with his colleagues in respectful, honest and cooperative manner,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill. \u201cNew America is a growing, dynamic and diverse organization of over 200 staff and fellows who work on a wide variety of important issues. Just 12 percent of our funding comes from corporate sources, and at no time would any funder be allowed to dictate the intellectual beliefs of our organization.\u201d \nGoogle has also denied trying to get Lynn fired. \nStill, the episode has given new momentum to Lynn\u2019s view that the power held by tech giants constitutes a threat to Americans\u2019 political and economic liberty. These companies have effectively taken control of the ways in which people communicate, Lynn argues, without any real checks on their power. \n\u201cPerhaps the most pressing thing of all is that Google, Facebook and to certain degrees also Amazon have captured the flow of information and ideas between citizen and citizen,\u201d Lynn said. \n\u201cOur ability to communicate freely with one another in this country, which is the primary basis for being able to protect our democracy, is now threatened in very real ways today,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is not a theoretical threat; this is a threat that exists today.\u201d \nIn a shared office space a block away from the White House, Lynn spoke with The Hill about the new independent think tank he\u2019s launched, called the Open Markets Institute, and the group\u2019s mission to change how the country thinks about competition policy. \nLynn and his team of scholars have been arguing that the approach to antitrust enforcement in vogue for decades has led to massive corporate consolidation, which in turn is responsible for corrupting the nation\u2019s politics, increasing wealth inequality and stifling innovation fostered by genuine competition. \nSince the 1980s, antitrust policy in the U.S. has largely drawn from what\u2019s known as the Chicago School, which holds that competition regulators should focus on how consumers are impacted by issues like pricing when deciding whether to take action against a company. The new antitrust movement argues that framework is too narrow and that regulators also need to take into account a company\u2019s effects on its competition. \nBefore antitrust policy became the focus of his career, Lynn covered the rise of globalization as a journalist. In 1984, he began working for wire services covering political crises in Peru and Venezuela. He later edited the magazine Global Business, and it was there that he began studying the effects of corporate consolidation. \nThe turning point came in 1999, after a devastating earthquake in Taiwan killed 2,400 people. What surprised Lynn was that the earthquake also took a toll on the American economy. The burgeoning tech industry at the time had been relying on Taiwan for imported computer components to the extent that U.S. factories were forced to shut down days after the earthquake hit. \nThat a single event in a faraway country could have such severe ripple effects domestically made Lynn wonder why the system was set up in a way that exposed it to such risks. \n\u201cSo I just became fascinated with this event, understanding this event and what it meant and how we got a point of putting all of our eggs in one basket,\u201d he said. \u201cDid people in the White House understand this? Did people in [the Defense Department] understand this? Did people in Treasury understand this?\u201d \nThe focus on concentration led him to study antitrust policy, and in 2001 he took a fellowship with New America to focus on the issue. In 2010, he began expanding the Open Markets team and taking on the role of an editor, overseeing its efforts to raise awareness about corporate concentration through investigative journalism, historical analysis and research. Lynn says the independent Open Markets team will be run much the same way, spurning the traditional think tank model. \nMany Washington think tanks are staffed by policy analysts who are in between government jobs, and Lynn says that they spend much of their time at those institutions learning how to write in a way that helps them sell their ideas to a larger audience. \n\u201cWhen New America was created, the idea was to flip that on its head and bring in really smart young reporters and editors and thinkers and academics \u2014 people who already know how to write, know how to tell stories \u2014 and get them to see themselves as policy people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have an idea, and they\u2019re not ashamed about pushing an idea out.\u201d \nLynn thinks that building a staff around those principles will be his biggest challenge as he works to get the organization off the ground. He said that he and his team have no use for economists because \u201canyone who was trained in an economics program has been trained in the wrong way to work with us.\u201d \nOpen Markets has eight people on staff, counting Lynn. They include Matt Stoller, a researcher and former congressional aide, and Lina Khan, who as a law student at Yale University unsettled the tech world with a paper advocating antitrust action against Amazon earlier this year. Heading up the group\u2019s advocacy efforts is Sarah Miller, a veteran Democratic staffer who\u2019s worked for John Podesta, Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton Chris Murphy\u2019s profile rises with gun tragedies DNC, RNC step up cyber protections Gun proposal picks up GOP support MORE and the Treasury Department. \nLynn and his team have been encouraged by the reception they\u2019ve gotten from lawmakers, even if the Trump administration hasn\u2019t shown much interest in their work. Lynn said that given the \u201cchaos\u201d in the White House, their best hope for their ideas to catch on is to partner with members of Congress, grass roots organizations and state attorneys general. \nAnd though the acrimonious break with New America has undoubtedly boosted his new organization\u2019s profile, Lynn says he\u2019s not interested in rehashing the controversy and said he has nothing but the \u201cgreatest respect\u201d for Slaughter. \n\u201cThis is a huge problem in America,\u201d he said, \u201cand we are just completely overwhelmed by the interest in our work from people on the Hill, from people in academia, from people in Europe, from people in the press. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on.

Scalise, just four days after his emotional return to the Capitol, called on Americans to donate blood and be kind to one another. \nThe Louisiana Republican echoed President Trump in calling the shootings \u201can act of pure evil.\u201d But Scalise, the third-ranking Republican in leadership, made no mention of stricter gun laws, nor did any of his GOP colleagues in Congress. \n\u201cIn this tragic moment, I encourage people across America to stand together in solidarity, and to support the Las Vegas community and all of those affected, especially by giving blood and encouraging others to do the same,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cIn the face of unspeakable evil, our whole nation must respond with countless acts of kindness, warmth and generosity.\u201d \nA spokesman for Scalise had no comment when asked if the majority whip\u2019s views have changed on gun control measures after he was shot. \nThe starkly different responses from Scalise and Giffords offer a snapshot of the broader gun debate on Capitol Hill \u2014 and help to explain why reform legislation has languished for years even in the face of tens of thousands of annual shooting deaths across the country. \nEven though both political parties have seen gun violence cut down members of their own conferences, their reactions to Las Vegas show Democrats and Republicans are no closer to finding common ground on the issue of gun control. Indeed, some lawmakers quickly predicted, to little surprise from observers, that even the nation\u2019s deadliest mass shooting won\u2019t sway the deeply entrenched partisan sentiments that have governed the gun debate for decades. \n\u201cThe left will ask for too much and the right will view anything as capitulation,\u201d said one House GOP lawmaker who backs stronger background checks for gun buyers. \nKelly said Monday that the offering of only \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d is tantamount to complicity, framing gun violence as a preventable public-health scourge and lambasting reform opponents as moral cowards. \n\u201cAction to save lives is the only acceptable moral course for our country,\u201d said Kelly, who along with his wife has devoted his life to reining in gun violence. \u201cWithout action, we are asking one person to be the next person to die because of our weakness to address this evil. And then another. And then another. And then another.\u201d \nAt the top of the Democrats\u2019 legislative wish list is a proposal requiring private gun sellers to screen potential buyers through an FBI database designed to weed out felons, domestic abusers, undocumented immigrants, those with severe mental illness and other categories of prohibited buyers. Under current federal law, only licensed gun dealers are required to conduct those screenings. \nCongress last considered that concept in 2013, just months after 20 first-graders and six teachers were shot to death at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

These are examples of originator \u201cbiologics\u201d \u2014 branded, highly specialized drugs that are made in living cells rather than via chemical synthesis like most drugs. \n\nWhile biologics were a revolutionary medical breakthrough and are enormously valuable, the time and investment associated with developing biologics \u2014 up to 15 years and more than $1.2 billion in some cases \u2014 and the lack of competition in the marketplace has led to high prices for patients who use them. This can create a barrier to care while driving up costs throughout the nation\u2019s entire health care system. In fact, while only 2 percent of the population uses biologic drugs, they account for 40 percent of prescription drug spending in the U.S. \nA biosimilar, on the other hand, is essentially what its name implies \u2014 a highly similar version of a biologic drug that is designed to match the branded originator biologic. Because they are made in living cells, biosimilars cannot be a perfect copy of their biologic \u201creference drug,\u201d they do provide the same medical benefits to patients with no differences in safety or effectiveness. The FDA can only approve a biosimilar for patient use if there are no meaningful clinical differences from its reference drug. As a result, patients and physicians can expect the same clinical results when using a biosimilar or the biologic reference drug. \nBiosimilars can also be far less expensive, because biosimilar producers can rely on safety and efficacy information from the reference product instead of repeating large-scale clinical trials. In fact, biosimilars are expected to cost up to 35 percent less than their reference drugs \u2014 which has the potential to offer major savings for patients and increase access to care. The Rand Corp., for instance, has predicted that by 2024 biosimilars will reduce direct spending on biologics in the U.S. by more than $44 billion. \nHowever, the U.S. has yet to realize the growth in the biosimilars market already seen overseas. In Europe, for example, biosimilars have been available to patients for more than a decade, with more than 20 biosimilar products now on the market. There has been more than 700 million patient days of treatment with biosimilars in Europe, and there are no new safety or efficacy concerns that are not already been known from the biologic reference drug. By contrast, the FDA has approved seven biosimilars, with only three of those currently available to patients. \nAs more biosimilars are approved by the FDA, patients and doctors need to be better informed about the safety and efficacy of biosimilars. Countries such as Australia and Germany are accomplishing this through national education campaigns that raise awareness about the benefits of biosimilars and offer incentives leading to further adoption of their use. \nRegulators continue to take important steps in boosting biosimilars in the U.S. with providing guidance to manufacturers and approving biosimilars. But there is more work to be done, and it is critical that education and policies are advanced to support the biosimilars reaching the marketplace so that patients can access these safe, effective and more cost-efficient medicines. \nStacie Phan is President of the Biosimilars Forum.

But those critics contend Trump\u2019s history of using red-hot rhetoric complicates his efforts to bring the country together following the deadly attack in Las Vegas. \nSimilar dynamics will be at play Tuesday, when Trump visits the devastated island of Puerto Rico. \nWhile Trump\u2019s response to hurricanes in Texas and Florida was widely praised, the federal response in Puerto Rico has been much more uneven \u2014 and has included the president jabbing at the mayor of San Juan on Twitter. \n\u201cSuch poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort,\u201d he wrote in two tweets on Saturday. \nTrump has tangled in recent weeks with targets ranging from the NFL to the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un (\u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d). \nHis hard-edged rhetoric extends much further back, to the name-calling of his primary and general election rivals in 2016. \nTrump\u2019s transgressions of political norms are numerous. Last year, he alleged that then-President Obama was the founder of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the wake of the mass killing at Pulse Nightclub in Florida in June 2016, in which 49 people were killed, Trump tweeted that he \u201cappreciate[d] the congrats\u201d for his earlier warnings about Islamic terrorism. \nThis history is one reason some observers express skepticism about whether Trump has the capacity to pull the nation together, even at moments of deep trauma. \n\u201cWhen you squander your moral credibility on other issues, it is hard to strike this note of national unity that we expect from the president,\u201d said Charlie Sykes, a one-time conservative radio host who is critical of both Trump and the broader right-wing media ecosystem. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t, in this country, have a nonpolitical king or queen who can stand above politics and unite the country. And here we have the most divisive leader on the scene trying to strike this note,\u201d Sykes added. \nTrump struck a somber tone when he appeared in the Diplomatic Room of the White House just before 11 a.m. Monday. \nHe described the nation as \u201cjoined together today in sadness, shock and grief.\u201d He cited Christian scripture about God being \u201cclose to the brokenhearted.\u201d He used the words \u201cunity\u201d or \u201cunite\u201d three times in five minutes. \nAll in all, it was a very different president from the one who was recently tagged by The New York Times as \u201cAmerica\u2019s apostle of anger, its deacon of divisiveness.\u201d \nEven some observers who are politically critical of the president acknowledged that his Monday remarks hit the right notes \u2014 though they added caveats. \n\u201cI think he did very well,\u201d said Patrick Granfield, who served on Obama\u2019s national security staff and as chief speechwriter to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D). \u201cBut I think he also benefits from incredibly low expectations \u2026 especially at times like this when the American people crave a consoler-in-chief.\u201d \nIn addition to his remarks in the White House, Trump led a moment of silence for the victims in Las Vegas, alongside first lady Melania Trump. \nPress secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders sought to portray a White House seeking to transcend partisanship. Sanders said of Trump that, \u201ccertainly his heart and compassion goes out to those that were affected.\u201d \nShe pushed back against suggestions that it was important to debate gun-control laws in the aftermath of the mass killing. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country,\u201d she said. \nSome supporters, who characterized criticisms as predictable carping from the left, hailed the White House\u2019s response to the tragedy. \nBarry Bennett, who was a senior adviser on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, said he thought the president\u2019s remarks were \u201cgreat.\u201d \n\u201cHe showed us what he is capable of,\u201d Bennett said. \nHe argued that those who drew attention to Trump\u2019s past divisive rhetoric are guilty of double standards. \n\u201cIt seems to me that if you are going to hate him no matter what he says, aren\u2019t you guilty of what you\u2019re calling him? You\u2019re accusing him of being the divider but you are practicing division.\u201d \nOne question is whether Trump can maintain the tone of comity he displayed on Monday when he visits Puerto Rico on Tuesday. \nThe temptation to hit back at critics could prove too strong for him to resist \u2014 and the results would be hard to predict. \nAn angry tweet or an unguarded comment could undo the tone of comity that Trump strove for on Monday. \n\u201cWith the president, you have to give it a couple of days,\u201d said Sykes. \u201cStriking a note of comfort and unity is kind of a baseline responsibility for any president. But he has a habit of undermining those messages even when he gets it right the first time.\u201d \nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage, primarily focused on Donald Trump", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "niall stanage", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "charlie sykes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick granfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah huckabee sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barry bennett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melania trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bennett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sykes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahm emanuel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "press", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pulse nightclub", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:37:36.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f7dfb46c3cd383919be47bee1079c1e58d3a143e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc56ivB84J7ei2lzGFSiicKPNKdPM9RStOLcRFYw3tVSyBjJCW4SnxYHUVTaAgAAzJTstNjhifE6NbWMFzKl8KJlmpKVfiojErKg--", "site_full": "thehill.com", "site": "thehill.com", "site_section": "http://thehill.com/rss/syndicator/19109", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "TheHill - The Hill News", "title": "Trump: Las Vegas shooter \u2018was a sick man\u2019", "title_full": "Trump: Las Vegas shooter \u2018was a sick man\u2019", "published": "2017-10-03T16:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald3_092817getty.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1472, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f7dfb46c3cd383919be47bee1079c1e58d3a143e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc56ivB84J7ei2lzGFSiicKPNKdPM9RStOLcRFYw3tVSyBjJCW4SnxYHUVTaAgAAzJTstNjhifE6NbWMFzKl8KJlmpKVfiojErKg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Max Greenwood", "published": "2017-10-03T16:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trump: Las Vegas shooter \u2018was a sick man\u2019", "text": "Trump: Las Vegas shooter \u2018was a sick man\u2019 By Max Greenwood - 10/03/17 09:13 AM EDT 9 \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 3, 2017 \nPresident Trump on Tuesday called the shooter that fired on a crowded music festival in Las Vegas on Sunday a \"very, very sick\" and \"demented\" individual. \n\"He was a sick man, a demented man,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"A lot of problems, I guess, and we're looking into him very, very seriously.

ADVERTISEMENT \u201cIt raises a question, which has been around for a while, which is, \u2018Who\u2019s in charge of foreign policy?\u2019 \u201d said retired Col. Richard Klass, a board member at the Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation. \u201cYou just read it and shake your head and say there\u2019s no coherence in this administration and no coherence to this guy.\u201d\nDuring a visit to Beijing on Saturday where North Korea was a top subject, Tillerson told reporters that the United States has communicated directly with Pyongyang about its nuclear and missile programs. \n\u201cWe are probing, so stay tuned,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cWe ask: \u2018Would you like to talk?\u2019 We have lines of communications to Pyongyang. We\u2019re not in a dark situation, a blackout.\u201d \nState Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert later elaborated that \u201cNorth Korean officials have shown no indication that they are interested in or are ready for talks regarding denuclearization.\u201d \nIn Sunday morning tweets, Trump publicly called out Tillerson\u2019s negotiation efforts. \n\u201cI told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,\u201d Trump tweeted, using his nickname for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \n\u201cSave your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!\u201d Trump continued. \nThe White House on Monday sought to clarify, saying Trump still has faith in Tillerson and that the only talks have been about the three Americans detained in North Korea and student Otto Wambier, who died in June after being released from North Korea in a coma. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been clear that now is not the time to talk,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a press briefing. \u201cThe only conversations that have taken place, or that would, would be on bringing back Americans who have been detained.\u201d \nShe added the administration supports \u201cdiplomatic pressure\u201d over talks. \nHarry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, said he believes Trump\u2019s tweets were meant as a comment on North Korea\u2019s lack of interest in talks, rather than a reaction to Tillerson himself. \nStill, Kazianis said Trump could be clearer about his intentions and that the interpretation of the tweets as undercutting Tillerson confuses everyone, from China to allies like South Korea and Japan to D.C. analysts and the North Koreans themselves. \n\u201cI think it muddles things for everybody,\u201d Kazianis said. \u201cI\u2019m confused at this point. I think what needs to happen is everybody get on same page and speak with one voice.\u201d \nTrump goes back and forth on his stance on talks, Kazianis continued. He cited Trump\u2019s response to a reporter last month who asked if negotiations were still an option. \n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Trump responded at the United Nations General Assembly. \nKazianis said the \u201cstakes are way too high\u201d for diplomacy to stay off the table. \n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the stress on both sides and the possibility of armed conflict ever get this high before,\u201d he said. \nKlass, the retired colonel, also said that Trump might change his mind about diplomacy. \n\u201cThe thing is next week, he\u2019ll say that we\u2019re on the diplomatic track,\u201d Klass said. \u201cIf Kim doesn\u2019t do anything like another missile or nuclear test, he may say nice things about him and about diplomacy.\u201d \nKlass said he could not recall a president publicly calling out a secretary of State like Trump did, though he did note that former President Carter\u2019s secretary of State resigned after Carter went against his recommendation and ordered a botched rescue operation during the 1980 Iran hostage crisis. \nIan Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, said Monday that diplomacy is not dead yet, citing Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis James Norman Mattis Overnight Defense: Senate passes 0B defense bill | 3,000 US troops heading to Afghanistan | Two more Navy officials fired over ship collisions Mattis hints at US military options for North Korea Mattis: US to send 3,000 more troops to Afghanistan MORE \u2019s support for diplomacy, as well as efforts by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin. \nStill, Bremmer acknowledged that Trump\u2019s tweets did undermine Tillerson. \n\u201cYet another indication that Tillerson isn't long for the job. But, for the umpteenth time, Trump's tweets aren't policy,\u201d Bremmer wrote to clients. \u201cIt's not as if there's a breakthrough on the near horizon, but there's now a number of actors trying to figure out what parameters of real negotiations would need to look like. That's progress.\u201d \nAdministration officials accept that there\u2019s no preemptive military option, Bremmer added. \n\u201cIt's not clear that president trump personally accepts that,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut everyone I've spoken with in the administration does.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rebecca kheel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tillerson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "angela merkel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bremmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kazianis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian bremmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah huckabee sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "otto wambier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry kazianis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mattis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heather nauert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "klass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james mattis james norman mattis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard klass", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hill trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eurasia group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for the national interest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for arms control", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyongyang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:04:33.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "33f116f90a06894774b374a68865cc947e19098b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc56ivB84J7ei2lzGFSiicKPNKdPM9RStOLcRFYw3tVSyBpKhi.jE_XMZQCdubLUtw7vEXjrprSWgM1dpEc5onTeiLFHw.AFwegA--", "site_full": "thehill.com", "site": "thehill.com", "site_section": "http://thehill.com/rss/syndicator/19109", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "TheHill - The Hill News", "title": "Trump: We'll talk about guns later", "title_full": "Trump: We'll talk about guns later", "published": "2017-10-03T16:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/donaldtrump_0_4.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1472, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "33f116f90a06894774b374a68865cc947e19098b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc56ivB84J7ei2lzGFSiicKPNKdPM9RStOLcRFYw3tVSyBpKhi.jE_XMZQCdubLUtw7vEXjrprSWgM1dpEc5onTeiLFHw.AFwegA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jordan Fabian", "published": "2017-10-03T16:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trump: We'll talk about guns later", "text": "Trump: We'll talk about guns later By Jordan Fabian - 10/03/17 09:21 AM EDT 1,418 President Trump on Tuesday did not rule out wading into the heated debate over gun violence, but indicated he does not believe now is the right time to discuss new laws. \u201cWe\u2019ll be talking about gun laws as time goes on,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.

Jim Himes (D-Conn.) on Tuesday slammed Congress's moment of silence for victims of a mass shooting in Las Vegas, arguing that such symbolic gestures ultimately fall short of the concrete action needed to address gun violence. \nIn an op-ed in The Washington Post , Himes said instead of holding a moment of silence, lawmakers would \"best honor the victims of brutal violence by preventing a similar tragedy from happening again.\" \n\"They will tell you it\u2019s 'too soon' to discuss policy in the aftermath of this shooting,\" Himes wrote. \"That it dishonors the dead to 'politicize' the tragedy. They will insist, instead, on meaningless moments of silence designed to look compassionate and hide our inaction.

We can\u2019t wait for the bloodshed to pause to start talking about the change that might save lives. The time to have these conversations and make the necessary reforms is now.\" \nHimes said he chose to boycott a moment of silence for the Las Vegas victims on Monday and had similarly done so after the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., last year.

That result meshes with another recent poll showing the race within 6 points. \nConsidering President Trump won the state in November by 28 points and Republican senators there typically win by double-digit margins, the polling indicates that Democrats could mount a competitive effort.

Brian Sandoval (R) formally declared a state of emergency in Clark County late Monday after a man armed with an arsenal of high-powered rifles killed 59 people and wounded hundreds of others at a concert on the Las Vegas Strip. The order directs all state agencies to supplement Clark County and Las Vegas law enforcement and health agencies working to save victims of the attack. Sandoval also signed a separate order declaring a public health and medical disaster. That order suspends some state medical rules to allow doctors and nurses from other states to temporarily practice in Nevada. Sandoval appeared shaken at a press conference Monday alongside city and federal officials, who offered an update on the investigation into the nation's deadliest mass shooting. \"My heart and prayers go to the victims and their families and friends who were brutally killed and injured by a shocking and cowardly act of senseless violence,\" Sandoval said in a statement Monday . The attack on a country music concert northeast from the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, where the shooter was firing from, sent hundreds of people to hospitals around the Las Vegas area, overwhelming emergency rooms and trauma centers. Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center, the trauma center closest to the concert venue, treated 180 patients, 30 of whom needed surgery, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. One doctor told the paper the center had 30 operating rooms working on patients at once. The Valley Hospital System, a network of six hospitals around the Las Vegas area, treated a total of 228 patients. Three St. Rose Dominican Hospitals treated 57 patients, including four in a level three trauma center who were in critical condition. Most Popular Don't miss a brief. Sign up for our daily email.

ADVERTISEMENT But the fact that those laws passed in the first place, in the year after a horrific mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., illustrates the power gun rights advocates wield in state legislatures, especially those states where Republicans control all levels of government.\nAfter Republicans claimed control of Iowa\u2019s state legislature in the 2016 elections, lawmakers this year passed the most sweeping package of gun rights laws in the country. The Iowa measure, House File 517, creates a so-called stand your ground policy. It also prevents cities from enacting stronger restrictions on gun rights than are permitted under state law. \nThe measure, signed by then-Gov. Terry Branstad (R), also allows concealed carry holders to enter the state Capitol building with their firearms. \nNew Hampshire and North Dakota will eliminate requirements for obtaining a permit for carrying concealed firearms, a measure gun rights advocates call constitutional carry. The Indiana and Wisconsin legislatures are considering similar measures that could move as early as this year. \nConcealed carry permit holders in four other states will be able to carry their weapons in more areas where guns had previously been banned. \nOhio permit holders will be allowed to carry concealed weapons in day care facilities and in public parts of airports. Those in Wyoming will be allowed to carry firearms in K-12 schools. Georgia and Arkansas residents may carry firearms on college and university campuses. \nAnd in Texas, lawmakers decriminalized possession of suppressors. \nSeveral more aggressive efforts to roll back gun regulations failed this year. Iowa and Nebraska lawmakers blocked proposals to end background check requirements for those seeking to buy a firearm. \nConstitutional carry measures failed in South Dakota and Montana, where legislators could not override the governor\u2019s veto. A similar measure stalled in the Texas legislature. \nSome states passed measures restricting gun access. Oregon legislators allowed residents concerned about family members or friends to seek an extreme risk protection order, which would block an individual with mental health issues from obtaining a weapon. \nLegislators in eight states \u2014 Rhode Island, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Tennessee and Utah \u2014 passed new measures to curb gun ownership for those who have been convicted of domestic abuse. \n\u201cWe are seeing strong bipartisan laws to keep people safe from gun violence in red, purple and blue states,\u201d said Kate Folmar, a spokeswoman for Everytown for Gun Safety, a group bankrolled by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing states really reject the gun lobby\u2019s guns-everywhere agenda.\u201d \nA National Rifle Association (NRA) spokeswoman did not comment by deadline. \nThree additional measures restricting gun rights have passed California\u2019s state legislature. One would ban guns on college campuses. Another would restrict the rights of gun owners to carry firearms in the open. And a third strengthens storage and security requirements on gun dealers. All three bills await Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s (D) signature. \nNew measures in Hawaii and Washington will require gun dealers to notify state law enforcement agencies when someone fails a background check required to purchase a gun. Tennessee passed a similar measure last year. \nAfter chafing for years under the Obama administration, gun rights supporters have new allies in the Trump administration. In his first months on the job, President Trump signed legislation rolling back an Obama-era rule limiting access to guns for those with a mental health condition. \nThe Justice Department also ended Operation Choke Point, another Obama-era program aimed at preventing criminal fraud in the gun industry. \nThe Republican-led Congress could act as soon as this week on a new measure to end a federal requirement to register suppressors and to expand protections for those who travel with guns across state lines. Gun owners have an estimated 1.3 million suppressors they have registered with the federal government. \nThe NRA has been especially active on Capitol Hill this year, after spending millions to elect Trump and Republican members of Congress.

ADVERTISEMENT Grassley has previously acknowledged that any Senate deal would likely not include a border wall. But his comments on Tuesday took on new weight as Republicans struggle to reach a consensus on how to pass a legislative fix for undocumented immigrations brought into the country as children. The House Homeland Security Committee is expected to take up legislation on Thursday that would provide $10 billion aimed at securing the U.S.-Mexico border, including funding for new wall and fencing construction, border defense technology and aerial surveillance like drones. But the administration has signaled that it is willing to separate the U.S.-Mexico border wall from the DACA discussions. That concession infuriated conservatives, who argue Trump is breaking his campaign promise to take a hard line on immigration, including building the wall and deporting roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants.

Michael Dreeben, the top legal counsel to Mueller's chief investigator, is delving into the history of presidential pardons, whether any restrictions could apply to them, and various interpretations of the law, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

The move comes days after the U.S. pulled roughly 60 percent of its embassy staff from the Cuban capital and is the latest sign of the worsening ties between the two former Cold War foes under President Trump. ADVERTISEMENT A State Department official said the expulsions will ensure \u201cwe have equitable staffing levels\u201d while still allowing the embassies to operate. The official would not confirm whether the percentage of Cubans expelled matches the U.S. staff cut in Havana. The Cuban officials were given seven days to leave Washington. The diplomatic tit-for-tat is a further blow to former President Obama\u2019s effort to re-establish ties with Cuba after decades of isolation. The State Department official said the U.S. is maintaining diplomatic ties with Cuba, but warned Havana it will need its \u201cfull assurances\u201d that U.S. diplomats will be protected in order to restore a full presence there. \u201cWe have underscored repeatedly to the Cuban government its responsibility for the security, safety, [and] well-being\u201d of our diplomats, the official said. The move will likely please Cuban-American lawmakers in Washington, who have urged the Trump administration to expel Cuban diplomats over the attacks. But the emissaries are not being declared persona non grata, meaning they will avoid the most serious punishment for foreign diplomats. The State Department said Tuesday that at least 22 U.S. embassy employees have been injured in the attacks. The affected diplomats have reportedly suffered loss of hearing, headaches and other symptoms. The Cuban government has denied it was behind any attack and has pledged to investigate the incidents. But so far, no culprit has been named. The Trump administration has not blamed the Castro government, but has repeatedly stated it bears responsibility for stopping them. In addition to the embassy drawdown, the Trump administration has stopped issuing visas for Cubans seeking to visit the U.S. and issued a travel warning for Americans who want to visit Cuba. The U.S. also expelled two other Cuban diplomats in May over the attacks. Tensions between Washington and Havana have repeatedly flared under Trump. The president over the summer rolled back part of Obama\u2019s Cuba policy, which he criticized as a \u201cone-sided deal.\u201d Cuban officials warned the move would damage relations between the two nations.

For at least a decade, the media has been sounding the alarm about the crumbling infrastructure and financial mismanagement of Puerto Rico. \nBut it all fell on deaf ears. Let\u2019s flashback to August 2014, when Reuters reporter Luciana Lopez showed that Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority was teetering on insolvency. The power company relied too heavily on expensive oil and was plagued by aging infrastructure dating back to the 1960s, a bloated workforce, and a billing system that was arbitrary and difficult to justify. ADVERTISEMENT As a result of the failing infrastructure, rolling blackouts, high unemployment and fleeing manufacturing, people were fleeing Puerto Rico prior to 2014, when the island faced $72 billion in debt. Puerto Rico has lost more than 200,000 citizens since 2000. That works out to about $20,000 dollars for every man, woman and child on the island, where the median income at that time was about $20,000.\nPuerto Rico\u2019s roads, bridges, dams, ports, hospitals, water treatment plants and more have been decaying for years. And it has only gotten worse. In August 2015, CNBC again warned of the dangers to the citizens of Puerto Rico of inferior and dangerous critical infrastructure. Fred Imbert reported that the real problem facing the people of Puerto Rico is the lack of maintenance of infrastructure. \nIn May 2016, just more than a year before Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, the Atlantic published an article alleging that even without damages caused by hurricanes or storms Puerto Rico was heading for crisis with a huge human toll of man-made causes. Reporter Vann Newkirk cited the electric grid on the brink of collapse and schools with dangerous wiring and unstable construction. He also wrote about the island\u2019s public health and its inferior healthcare facilities, noting that San Juan\u2019s Centro Medico Hospital had to delay payments on debt to provide basic healthcare to patients. The medical director was quoted as saying, \u201cWe are hanging by a thread.\u201d \nIt is important to understand that Puerto Rico was destined for humanitarian crisis and was in crisis long before Hurricane Maria. It was only a matter of time before it became evident to the mainland of the United States and the world. The Obama administration had years, but it let Puerto Rico slip into decay and put the people residing there at grave risk. Now, people are pointing fingers at the Trump administration that somehow the president is to blame for the harm that has come to Puerto Rico, when it is really years of neglect and incompetence by the federal government as well as local officials. \nToday, the people of Puerto Rico need help on a scale that our nation has rarely seen before. Never in modern times have so many Americans suffered from what amounts to total devastation of their homes, businesses, neighborhoods and infrastructure. We as a nation must make every effort to provide all the help we can muster to provide the necessary support to the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. But we must also manage expectations and not blame the current administration for the gross incompetence of others who created the crisis the people now face. This remediation will take a decade or more and cost tens of billions of dollars. \nThe plight of our fellow citizens should be a wake-up call for our nation. There are lessons to be learned and heeded. Policymakers kick the can down road all the time, believing there are no solutions, only band-aids or neglect. America is $20 trillion in debt. Our nation\u2019s critical infrastructure is in dire needs of repair, replacement and maintenance. Our national health care and entitlement programs are teetering on insolvency. Our states and cities face their own financial challenges. \nPuerto Rico\u2019s collapse could be our future if we do not turn our attention to solving problems before crisis. A hurricane was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back in Puerto Rico, but the camel\u2019s back was destined to be broken by the rider at some point. The main job of government is to prevent crises, not merely respond to them. It is time to fix things and make sacrifices for the greater good. \nBradley A.

Wilson - 10/03/17 06:00 AM EDT 44 \u00a9 Thinkstock/Istock/Benkrut \nThe power of the real estate and home building industries is being put to the test in a fight with Republicans over a key tax break for homebuyers \u2014 the mortgage interest deduction. \nThe National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) worry the new tax-reform plan from President Trump and congressional GOP leaders will undercut the deduction, and the groups are vowing to use their considerable political muscle to save the benefit. \n\u201cSince 1913, [Congress has] provided an incentive in the tax code to buy a house. We as a society and as a country decided long ago that homeownership stabilized communities and increased involvement,\u201d said Jamie Gregory, the deputy chief lobbyist at the National Association of Realtors. ADVERTISEMENT The mortgage deduction allows homeowners who itemize their returns to deduct interest paid on their mortgage from their taxable income, and is one of the most popular benefits in the tax code.\nThe new GOP tax-reform plan nearly doubles the standard deduction from $12,700 for a married couple to $24,000, making it likely fewer Americans would claim the mortgage deduction. The plan also gets rid of another benefit that allows taxpayers to deduct state and local taxes from their income. \nWhile the mortgage deduction is staying on the books, those two changes, industry groups fear, could deliver a one-two punch to homebuyers and the real estate market. \n\u201cOne of the thing we\u2019re telling members is that while the mortgage interest deduction is being retained, there is a bigger public policy effect happening,\u201d Gregory explained. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have less homeownership because you\u2019re taking away one of the incentives to do it.\u201d \nThe industry groups have long flexed their clout on Capitol Hill. They have members in virtually every congressional district. The industry also makes up a huge chunk of economic activity, with housing investment representing 15-18 percent of Gross Domestic Product, according to a study by NAHB. \nThe lobbying groups are also big spenders. The National Association of Realtors is often the second-highest spender on advocacy, second only to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \nAlready in 2017, the group has spent more than $21 million, according to disclosure records, a total that includes all political spending, such as campaign contributions and state and local spending. \nThe fight over the deduction has high stakes for both sides. \nAccording to Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow, an online real estate company. roughly 30 percent of homeowners benefit from the mortgage interest deduction. Gudell told The Hill that figure could drop to 5 percent or lower under the GOP tax plan. \nThe IRS says 22 percent of homeowners claimed the deduction in 2015 alone. \nA study commissioned by NAR claims as many as 78 percent of homeowners use the mortgage interest deduction at some point. \nThe White House and Congress are strongly behind the tax plan, which they unveiled last week. And they are downplaying the effect on the homebuying deduction. \n\u201cPeople don\u2019t buy homes because of the mortgage deduction,\u201d Gary Cohn, Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, told reporters on Thursday. \nKevin Patrick Brady GOP eyes limits on investor tax break Overnight Finance: White House requests B for disaster relief | Ex-Equifax chief grilled over stock sales | House panel approves B for border wall | Tax plan puts swing-state Republicans in tough spot Swing-seat Republicans squirm over GOP tax plan MORE (R-Texas), chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters last week that despite the changes in the GOP\u2019s proposal, lawmakers will work to ensure Americans are still encouraged to become homeowners. \n\"We're focused on continuing to reward and incentivize homeownership. In a simpler tax code, a post-card style system, fewer Americans will need to itemize,\u201d said Brady. \u201cThey'll get their tax cut in the simpler form. So we'll continue [to] explore ways to make sure that that homeownership and investment people make ... is protected.\" \nGregory said realtors are already ramping up their efforts to protect the deduction. \n\u201cWe still have a long way to go. The framework has to be fleshed out, but we are starting to increase our activity,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cBefore we get to a Ways and Means markup, yes, it will be all hands on deck,\u201d including mobilizing the group\u2019s members in congressional districts. \nThe National Association of Realtors' political action committee (PAC) has already doled out $2.5 million to congressional campaigns and still has about $10.6 million in its coffers for the 2018 election. It also has a super-PAC at the ready. \nThe home builders group is taking a slightly different tact. It is offering broad support for the GOP tax plan while also voicing its concerns over the effects on the mortgage deduction. \n\u201cI\u2019ve made a lot noise saying we\u2019re at DEFCON 1 to be for or against this bill,\u201d said Jerry Howard, the CEO of the National Association of Home Builders, \u201cAnd we\u2019ve pushed the button to be for the bill and we\u2019re going to do the best we can to help craft a very good piece of tax legislation and get it passed.\u201d \nNAHB says that like Brady they want to find \u201ccreative\u201d ways to offset any damage to potential homebuyers. \n\u201cWe are very aware of the fact that the mortgage interest deduction is watered down and made very inefficient. If you read the actual language in the proposal in the itemized deduction section, it talks about a meaningful tax incentive or maintaining tax incentives for mortgage interest,\u201d Howard said. \n\u201cWe believe they are open to alternatives which might be more efficient than the proposal that\u2019s on the table,\u201d he continued. \nHe floated offering a tax credit for buying a home instead of a deduction. \nHis group spent more than $2 million on federal advocacy in the first half of this year, including $446,500 in political contributions. \n\u201cYou put a bunch of bright people in a room and there\u2019s all kinds of ideas that get flowing,\" Howard said. \n\"We want to be in the room.\u201d \n\u2014 Naomi Jagoda contributed", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:22:48.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c7ee459fe40b1c4cef534f24d6c24c0188ac7cc4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc5zqIRW97vubDo12pgVqo.za1yS5S1GtkGxWzCfRoFKfROX_Vai5G5qEshMtr62cAeik._VLm9PI40DWFI_hm6kAHKtqRHefr_Zc_6w5rFxZI7olGF2f.u1YMg9v9RspRv_ePmtb.I9qr", "site_full": "thehill.com", "site": "thehill.com", "site_section": "http://news.google.com/news?ned=us&topic=w&output=rss", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "World - Google News", "title": "Two years later: 5 recommendations for a new Iran nuclear policy - The Hill", "title_full": "Two years later: 5 recommendations for a new Iran nuclear policy - The Hill", "published": "2017-10-03T18:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/gettyimages-51395294.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1472, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c7ee459fe40b1c4cef534f24d6c24c0188ac7cc4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc5zqIRW97vubDo12pgVqo.za1yS5S1GtkGxWzCfRoFKfROX_Vai5G5qEshMtr62cAeik._VLm9PI40DWFI_hm6kAHKtqRHefr_Zc_6w5rFxZI7olGF2f.u1YMg9v9RspRv_ePmtb.I9qr", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T18:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Two years later: 5 recommendations for a new Iran nuclear policy - The Hill", "text": "Two years later: 5 recommendations for a new Iran nuclear policy By Former Amb. Adam Ereli, opinion contributor \u2014 10/03/17 11:40 AM EDT The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill 25 \u00a9 Getty \nTwo years into the nuclear deal with Iran \u2014 known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) \u2014 it has become clear that neither the people of Iran nor the region are better off. \nThe previous administration\u2019s policy of engagement failed to address rampant human rights violations, regional aggression, a burgeoning missile program and the export of terrorism, all of which are crippling Iran\u2019s own population. ADVERTISEMENT President Trump came into office as a force of change; here are five ways he can change Washington\u2019s culture of politics as usual and respond positively to the long-suffering Iranian people\u2019s call for change: Protect Pro-Democracy Iranians \nIn signing the JCPOA, the P5+1 (namely the UN Security Council's five permanent members, plus Germany) opted to trust a regime that boasts of deceiving the West, rather than the Iranian people, who are generally acknowledged to be pro-western and anti-regime. President Trump acknowledged this in his remarks this September to the UN General Assembly: \n\u201cThe entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. This is what causes the regime to restrict internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protesters, and imprison political reformers.\u201d \nInstead of protecting Iran\u2019s people, the JCPOA ignores their aspirations and suffering at a terrible cost. The deal does nothing to slow rampant arrests and mass executions, not to mention the regime\u2019s continuing concealment of its nuclear facilities. Let's stop giving the mullah\u2019s a free pass to murder the Iranian people. Challenge Iranian Meddling \nThe JCPOA did nothing to deter the violence, terror and displacement that Iran exports to its neighbors. In the two years since signing the JCPOA, the P5+1 have turned a blind eye to the expansion of Iranian influence in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon. Western credibility with its regional allies has suffered as a result; the prospects with a host of regional actors have increased; and the Iranian regime has been emboldened. An agreement that ignores Iran\u2019s extraterritorial incursions, chemical weapons and terrorism isn\u2019t an agreement; it\u2019s capitulation. Get Tough on Ballistic Missiles \nAn essential element of any nuclear program is the ability to deliver a warhead via ballistic missiles. While the JCPOA was able to pause projects related to the nuclear fuel cycle for 10 (now eight) years, ballistic missile testing was left unchecked. \nPresident Trump has addressed the ongoing development of Iran's missile program, saying, \u201cWe cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides for the eventual construction of a nuclear program.\u201d Stop Funding the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) \nThe JCPOA released billions of dollars in frozen assets to Iran and opened the door to deals worth billions more. The IRGC and its Quds Force, Iran\u2019s weapons of choice in spreading terror, control a financial empire comprising easily 40 percent of Iran\u2019s total economy. An estimated 80 percent of the profits of newly signed deals will directly benefit the ruling regime, not the Iranian people, with the Quds Force as perhaps the biggest winner. \nLast August, Congress overwhelmingly passed H.R. 3364, which subjected the IRGC to sanctions under Executive Order 13224 issued by President George W. Bush. The United States should immediately and strictly enforce this legislation, with zero tolerance of any violations. Get Serious About Regime Change \nIran will remain a threat to the U.S. and its allies as long as the clerical regime remains in power. If the United States is serious about changing Iranian behavior, it has to consider changing the regime. Secretary of State Tillerson and Secretary of Defense Mattis have publicly spoken about U.S. policy moving in this direction. \nKey U.S. regional partners are also increasingly outspoken on this issue. Saudi Arabia, the Syrian opposition, Egypt, Yemen and the Palestinian Authority all sent official delegations to a gathering o f around 100,000 supporters of the Iranian opposition in Paris. In his remarks to the gathering, former Saudi Intelligence Chief and Ambassador to the United States Prince Turki bin Faisal bin Abdulaziz al Saud said, \u201cThe behavior of the regime in Tehran does not make it a democratic system, but a murderous dictatorship.\u201d \nHe called on all sectors of Iranian society to free themselves from the rule of Velayat-e Faqih (theocratic despotism). President Trump\u2019s reference to the \u201cmurderous regime\u201d in Tehran that \u201ccannot endure forever,\u201d was spot-on. \nIf President Trump is looking for genuine change, the circumstances are ripe and the time is now. \nAmbassador Adam Ereli was the U.S. Ambassador to Bahrain and deputy State Department spokesperson during the Bush administration.

And next year, Wells Fargo will be a better bank than it is today,\u201d Sloan said. \nThe hearing Tuesday was Sloan\u2019s first appearance on Capitol Hill as Wells Fargo\u2019s chief, and comes after a year of deepening scandal for the San Francisco-based bank. \nLawmakers from both parties criticized Sloan on Tuesday for the various scandals that had gone on allegedly without his knowledge, but the 30-year Wells Fargo veteran faced the harshest criticism from Democrats. \nDemocratic lawmakers went after Sloan for talking up the bank\u2019s aggressive growth strategy to investors while leaders pressured lower-level employees with excessive sales goals. They also slammed the bank for pursuing arbitrated settlements with defrauded consumers as Democrats hone in on the controversial practice. \n\u201cYou enabled this fake account scam, you got rich off of it, and then you tried to cover it up,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann Warren Senate Dems hold floor talk-a-thon against latest ObamaCare repeal bill Trump bets base will stick with him on immigration Dems call for action against Cassidy-Graham ObamaCare repeal MORE (D-Mass.), who is considered a potential 2020 presidential candidate. \u201cAt best you were incompetent, at worst you were complicit. Either way, you should be fired.\u201d \nSeveral state and federal agencies are investigating Wells Fargo for fraudulent sales practices first revealed in late 2015. The bank opened up to 3.5 million bank and credit card accounts for customers since 2009 without their consent, charging 190,000 patrons $6 million in fees for services they never requested \u2014 1.1 million more accounts than Wells Fargo initially admitted to opening in September 2016, when federal regulators first cracked down on the bank for the fraudulent sales. \nWells Fargo is also attempting to contain the fallout from other sales-related scandals. \nThe bank was caught signing customers up for unnecessary auto insurance and life insurance plans, and also paid a $108 million settlement after charging veterans hidden fees to refinance their mortgages. \nThe various scandals cost Wells Fargo customers millions in fees, points on their credit scores and, in some cases, their vehicles. \nSloan told lawmakers that he\u2019s \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for Wells Fargo\u2019s sales practices, the bank\u2019s slow response to the scandals and for coming to Congress in 2016 \u201cwithout a good plan.\u201d \n\u201cWe recognized too late the full scope and seriousness of the problems,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cWe had not fully grappled with the damage the sales practices scandal had done to our customers, our team members, and their trust in the bank.\u201d \nJohn Stumpf, Sloan\u2019s predecessor who left the bank last fall, was slammed by lawmakers last year in appearances before the Senate Banking panel and House Financial Services Committee. Lawmakers across both chambers and parties skewered Stumpf and said he should face jail time. He retired soon after. \nSloan\u2019s testimony Tuesday outlined several steps taken by top Wells Fargo executives to pay retribution for the fraudulent sales. \nNo member of the bank\u2019s operating committee who served before September 2016 received a bonus for that year, according to Sloan. Both Stumpf and former consumer banking chief Carrie Tolstedt forfeited their 2016 bonuses and gave up more than $60 million in compensation each. \nWells Fargo has also attempted to clean up its sales practices by eliminating incentives that pressured employees to open fake accounts, and implement new, stricter compliance standards across all bank branches. \nBut actions taken by Wells Fargo executives weren\u2019t enough to satisfy the demands of angry lawmakers stunned by the cascading scandals. Despite the departures of Stumpf and Tolstedt, much of the bank\u2019s senior leadership has stayed in place. Senators from both parties wondered how much Wells Fargo could actually change under the same executives. \n\"Your sales culture isn\u2019t dictated by the sales products. It\u2019s not the sales goals. It\u2019s not the product selection. It\u2019s the people,\" said Sen.

He insisted that his long tenure at the bank equipped him well to clean up Wells Fargo, which had improved greatly in the past year. \n\u201cI have made mistakes. I certainly haven\u2019t been perfect.\u201d Sloan said, adding that he\u2019s \u201cmade fundamental change at this company, so I\u2019m not afraid to make changes when it\u2019s needed.\u201d \nSloan\u2019s explanations didn\u2019t satisfy Wells Fargo\u2019s most ardent critics, who seized on the bank\u2019s use of forced arbitration to settle lawsuits. Several unsuccessfully asked him to promise that the bank wouldn\u2019t use forced arbitration to settle claims over fake accounts, as Sloan insisted the bank would make arbitration unnecessary for consumers. \nSloan enraged several Democrats during his testimony when he didn\u2019t appear to know about cases where Wells Fargo asked courts to enforce arbitration clauses, a growing liberal target, in contracts for fake accounts. \n\u201cI would know about that if I were you, especially coming before this body, said Sen.

ADVERTISEMENT It correlates with President Trump\u2019s promise to save the coal industry and the administration\u2019s argument that a rash of coal and nuclear plant closings is threatening the electric grid. \nPerry wants to increase the payments to troubled coal and nuclear plants by requiring that certain regional electric grid operations pay power plants their actual costs of operating plus a \u201cfair rate of return.\u201d \nIt would be a significant shift from the bidding process now allowed and would almost certainly raise electricity costs for consumers, critics say of the plan. \nBut Perry\u2019s idea has garnered significant praise from coal and nuclear industry leaders, who say it could revive plants they say deserve to be paid more. \nThey argue that because these plants build up larger fuel supplies than competitors producing electricity from wind and solar power, they should be paid more. \n\u201cWe commend Secretary Perry for initiating a rulemaking by FERC that will finally value the on-site fuel security provided by the coal fleet,\u201d said Paul Bailey, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. \n\u201cThe coal fleet has large stockpiles of coal that help to ensure grid resilience and reliability,\u201d he said. \nThe renewable power industry disagrees. \nAlong with environmentalists and grid experts, they say Perry\u2019s proposal, which would require FERC approval to go into effect, is a poor excuse to abide by Trump\u2019s campaign promises. \n\u201cIt suggests that, somehow, there\u2019s something categorically different about that kind of technology than other technology on the grid,\u201d said Sue Tierney, an energy expert at the Analysis Group who was an assistant secretary of Energy under former President Clinton. \nThe proposal also divided the natural gas industry from coal and nuclear, even though it often sided with its rivals to oppose Obama administration climate policies. \nSince gas plants usually get their fuel from pipelines and do not store it at the plants, they would not be eligible for incentives that could be doled out to the nuclear and coal industries. \n\u201cWe are concerned the agency has mischaracterized the lessons learned from past weather-related events and appears to suggest that additional regulation is the answer where markets have already proven the ability to greatly benefit consumers and give our electric system the flexibility needed to meet constantly, and often rapidly, changing electricity demands,\u201d said Marty Durbin, chief strategy officer at the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the natural gas industry\u2019s interests. \nAt the heart of the debate is whether plant retirements are making the grid less resilient \u2014 and whether coal and nuclear power are the answer. Critics cite recent reports from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, the National Academies of Science and elsewhere to argue that the plant closure problem is overblown. \nPerry asked FERC to write a new regulation within 60 days. Past major rules have taken a year to formulate, and the resilience rule would likely rejigger the country\u2019s whole power grid. \n\u201cThe turnaround they requested is very quick,\u201d said Tony Clark, a Republican and former FERC commissioner from 2012 to 2016. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to do a complete revamp of the market in that amount of time.\u201d \nBut since FERC is independent, it has the power to extend that time window. Eleven energy associations teamed up Monday to ask for such an extension. \nFor comparison, the Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency rule to reduce the power sector\u2019s carbon emissions, took years to write and didn\u2019t enforce emissions reductions until 2022. \nPerry\u2019s request is likely to raise legal issues as well, experts said. \nFERC\u2019s authority centers on the responsibility to ensure that wholesale power rates are \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d \nAny new regulation would have to demonstrate that without the higher payments for coal and nuclear, rates are unjust or unreasonable. If it fails to do so, a federal court could overturn the new regulation. \n\u201cFERC does not have the authority to just decide that a particular source of generation gets paid differently now because Rick Perry requested it,\u201d said Justin Gundlach, a climate change law fellow at Columbia University Law School. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty high evidentiary bar, and FERC would need to show some basis whereby rates are not just and reasonable because of how different sources are paid,\u201d he said. \nFERC only has three commissioners out of its five-person contingent. Two additional nominees \u2014 including the intended chairman, Kevin McIntyre \u2014 are awaiting a final Senate confirmation vote. \nThe current chairman, Neil Chatterjee, was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnell Senate passes 0B defense bill Overnight Health Care: New GOP ObamaCare repeal bill gains momentum Overnight Finance: CBO to release limited analysis of ObamaCare repeal bill | DOJ investigates Equifax stock sales | House weighs tougher rules for banks dealing with North Korea MORE \u2019s (R-Ky.) energy adviser and is a strong supporter of coal. He said on a podcast in August that \u201cgeneration, including our existing coal and nuclear fleet, need to be properly compensated to recognize the value they provide to the system.\u201d \nBut he also strongly guards the commission\u2019s independence, and he\u2019s resistant to making any major policy moves before McIntyre takes office. \nThe commission cannot legally write policies that favor certain generating sources over others. Nonetheless, Perry\u2019s opponents see the idea as a clear attempt to favor coal and nuclear. \n\u201cRick Perry is trying to slam through an outrageous bailout of the coal and nuclear industries on the backs of American consumers,\u201d said Kit Kennedy, director for energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D), who has already filed numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration, immediately promised a fight. \n\u201cMy office will forcefully oppose this and other efforts of the Trump administration to put the interests of special interests ahead of the health, safety, and wallets of New Yorkers,\u201d he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "perry", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "timothy cama", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ric", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kit kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gary cohn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony clark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin mcintyre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard perry perry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil chatterjee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcintyre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric schneiderman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul bailey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin gundlach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marty durbin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell addison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sue tierney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rick perry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "analysis group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "natural resources defense council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american petroleum institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un more", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american coalition for clean coal electricity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal energy regulatory commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ferc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia university law school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north american electric reliability corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national academies of science", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clean power plan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environmental protection agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitchell mcconnell senate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:46:09.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53608d2f02ca8a9e1b5aca59e86ce444bf24d1ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc5yXCSZON.8sshdmz_1P.V2g4djMZUGAPkB4yeyshoobhucw7rrSETbnl81_qRGBgUAQ1kduQPTYuNe3s5xur.v2jSjRbqUgbMOpGSs00PknsVE3FshxscEWYybabIme5BA--", "site_full": "thehill.com", "site": "thehill.com", "site_section": "http://thehill.com/taxonomy/term/29/feed#", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "The Hill: Ballot Box", "title": "Keith Olbermann: The NRA is 'a terrorist organization'", "title_full": "Keith Olbermann: The NRA is 'a terrorist organization'", "published": "2017-10-03T16:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/olbermann.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1472, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "53608d2f02ca8a9e1b5aca59e86ce444bf24d1ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc5yXCSZON.8sshdmz_1P.V2g4djMZUGAPkB4yeyshoobhucw7rrSETbnl81_qRGBgUAQ1kduQPTYuNe3s5xur.v2jSjRbqUgbMOpGSs00PknsVE3FshxscEWYybabIme5BA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "aanapol@thehill.com (Avery Anapol)", "published": "2017-10-03T16:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Keith Olbermann: The NRA is 'a terrorist organization'", "text": "Keith Olbermann: The NRA is 'a terrorist organization' By Avery Anapol -

Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) and Mike Bober, Opinion Contributors \u2014 10/03/17 11:00 AM   60 \nEach year, Congress works hard to pass bills that will help the American people. While acrimony and partisanship have made this more difficult, lawmakers are considering two bills that have bipartisan support on Capitol Hill and among the American people: H.R. 2327 and H.R. 909, the Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers (PAWS) , and the Pets And Women Safety (PAWS) Acts of 2017. \nEach of these bills involves man\u2019s best friend, and both provide for an underserved segment of America. In the case of H.R. 2327, veterans with PTSD and traumatic brain injuries are provided opportunities for healing through grant-funded service dogs. H.R. 909 expands the number of domestic abuse shelters that can accept pets, in order to help abused women escape domestic violence. ADVERTISEMENT Rep. Cohen is a sponsor of both bills, and PIJAC supports them on behalf of the professional pet care community. Passing these bills now would be a powerful symbol to a public eager for Congress to lead, as National Suicide Prevention Month ends and National Domestic Violence Awareness Month begins.\nThe House is already taking important steps to help veterans get the companions they need. On Sept. 26, the House Veterans Affairs Committee held a hearing about several bills, including H.R. 2327, that can help servicemembers adjust back to non-combat life. H.R. 2327 has support among myriad veterans\u2019 groups , and 200 House co-sponsors. With about 20 veterans committing suicide each day , the PAWS Act is just one way that Congress can improve assistance to America\u2019s military servicemembers who return from war with physical and mental scars. \nH.R. 909 is likewise an important bill with enormous support. It has 230 co-sponsors in the House and 20 in the Senate. It will provide assistance to many of the approximately one in four women, and one in seven men, who are domestically abused each year . \nStudies are clear that in a home where human abuse is taking place, a pet is also often a target. With nearly half of women saying they have returned to an abusive home out of concern for a pet\u2019s safety, H.R. 909 is clearly necessary to save lives and prevent more harm to innocent human and animal victims. \nThe bill provides funds so that abuse shelters can accommodate pets, and extends domestic abuse laws so that courts may require abusers to provide restitution for veterinary costs a victim may incur. \nThese bills recognize the strength of the human-animal bond. Fully 65 percent of U.S. households have a pet ; 88 percent of House and Senate offices allow pets in their offices. \nNot only is connecting people and pets good business \u2013 with 1.3 million jobs, mostly small business, supported in 2015 alone \u2013 it is also great for human health . Just owning a pet saves over $11 billion in health care dollars each year, according to a conservative study by George Mason University. Other studies show direct links to less stress, better educational results, and improved health for senior citizens. \nWhether in Washington, D.C. or Tennessee, pets are everyone\u2019s best friend. Congress should use the power of pets to bring people together by passing H.R. 2327 and H.R. 909. \nRepresentative Steve Cohen represents the 9 th District of Tennessee.

Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) is calling on the Supreme Court to \"terminate\" gerrymandering, the process of drawing congressional districts in such a way as to give one party an electoral advantage. \nSpeaking at an anti-gerrymandering rally outside the nation's highest court on Tuesday, the former \"Celebrity Apprentice\" host and \"Terminator\" actor railed against a \"fixed system\" in which \"politicians are picking the voters.\" \n\"It's a fixed system \u2014 that's what gerrymandering is all about,\" he said. \"And this is why I say that the only one that can fix it is the Supreme Court, and that's why we're here today, at the Supreme Court \u2014 to ask them to fix this problem of severe gerrymandering.\" ADVERTISEMENT \n\"You know it's a system where the politicians are picking the voters, rather than the voters picking the politicians. So I say it's time to say hasta la vista to gerrymandering. And it is time to terminate gerrymandering.\" \nSchwarzenegger's comments came as oral arguments begin in Gill v. Whitford, a case regarding whether a 2011 redistricting plan passed by Wisconsin's Republican-controlled state legislature was so excessively gerrymandered that it amounted to a constitutional violation. \nRacial gerrymandering has already been struck down by the court. And the Supreme Court has said that lower courts have the power to decide partisan gerrymandering cases, but has never weighed in on how to decide when the practice goes too far. \nSchwarzenegger, 70, has long pushed for an end to gerrymandering. He said Tuesday that Congress was clearly unwilling to address the issue, and that the Supreme Court would have to step in and decide on the issue. \n\"Einstein already said a long time ago that the ones that create the problem cannot fix it,\" he said. \"And so Congress will never, ever fix this problem, because they have one interest and one interest only, and this is to stay in power.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "schwarzenegger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "max greenwood", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "arnold schwarzenegger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "einstein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gill v. whitford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:51:41.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e1291f1374a397ede127473dcbc0a43d3e2aff18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc5yXCSZON.8sszI.qUl0TncZOAoUiGV9OQX2NiZmkXmnDmlfyuN4KE6U27a8JInq4XW96wrQ2rXFBciv1gQCGn6_4GOCCzl8JkiqZj57ofsUtzf6A1EeXrh9y3JBmDlAnkLAbz27O6QmK", "site_full": "thehill.com", "site": "thehill.com", "site_section": "http://thehill.com/component/rss-syndicator/?feed_id=33", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "TheHill - Briefing Room", "title": "Trump: Puerto Rico has 'thrown our budget a little out of whack'", "title_full": "Trump: Puerto Rico has 'thrown our budget a little out of whack'", "published": "2017-10-03T19:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trump3_100317getty.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1472, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e1291f1374a397ede127473dcbc0a43d3e2aff18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc5yXCSZON.8sszI.qUl0TncZOAoUiGV9OQX2NiZmkXmnDmlfyuN4KE6U27a8JInq4XW96wrQ2rXFBciv1gQCGn6_4GOCCzl8JkiqZj57ofsUtzf6A1EeXrh9y3JBmDlAnkLAbz27O6QmK", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jonathan Easley", "published": "2017-10-03T19:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trump: Puerto Rico has 'thrown our budget a little out of whack'", "text": "Trump: Puerto Rico has 'thrown our budget a little out of whack' By Jonathan Easley - 10/03/17 12:36 PM EDT 48,343 President Trump on Tuesday noted the enormous cost associated with the hurricane relief and rescue mission in Puerto Rico, saying at a meeting with officials in San Juan on Tuesday that the efforts had \u201cthrown our budget a little out of whack.\u201d The president appeared in good spirits as he went around the room praising officials in his administration and local leaders in Puerto Rico.

ADVERTISEMENT \nIn mid-September, the department issued a public operational directive telling agencies to come up with \u201cdetailed plans\u201d to remove Kaspersky software from their systems, citing ties between Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence and potential risks to U.S. national security. \nThe announcement prompted questions about why DHS would issue such a public announcement without producing evidence to back it up. Kaspersky, which has headquarters in Moscow but operations worldwide, has long fought allegations in the media of ties to the Russian government. \nThe issue has caught the attention of Capitol Hill in light of concerns about Russian interference in the presidential election. \nOn Tuesday, Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.) asked Krebs, who is performing the duties of undersecretary at the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), to specify \u201cwhat analysis led to the removal of Kaspersky from federal networks.\u201d \nThough Krebs answered that the department primarily relied on \u201copen-source\u201d information to make the decision, he indicated that he would be willing to address the topic in a closed session. DHS officials typically brief committee members in a classified setting on a monthly basis. \nJeannette Manfra, another DHS cybersecurity official who was at the hearing, later told reporters on the sidelines of a Washington cybersecurity summit that Elaine Duke, the department\u2019s acting secretary, \u201cmade her decisions based off of a variety of sources and information, much of which is unclassified.\u201d \n\u201cWe talked about how we arrived at those conclusions in the press statement concurrent to the issuance of the binding operational directive,\u201d Manfra said. \u201cWe also are enabling the company and any other impacted entities to provide any additional material that we should consider. So we are in that process now.\" \nThe Sept. 13 directive, which came from the very top of the department, raised an alarm that Kaspersky could wittingly or unwittingly allow the Russian government to compromise U.S. systems. \n\u201cThe Department is concerned about the ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence and other government agencies, and requirements under Russian law that allow Russian intelligence agencies to request or compel assistance from Kaspersky and to intercept communications transiting Russian networks,\u201d the directive said. \n\u201cThe risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security,\u201d it said. \nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed support for the decision. \nKaspersky has described the allegations as unfounded and said that it will take DHS up on its offer to provide a written statement assuaging concerns about its anti-virus software. \nWhile the federal government has never produced evidence demonstrating ties between Kaspersky and the Russian government, the FBI is said to be pressing forward with a longstanding probe into the company. \nMeanwhile, Eugene Kaspersky, the company\u2019s founder, had been asked to testify before Congress in September, but the hearing before the House Science Committee has been postponed indefinitely.

ADVERTISEMENT \nThe method of targeting has been used by United States political campaigns and American companies to convey messages to individuals who could be interested, the report said. \nFacebook in a Tuesday update to a post describing the advertisements the company turned over to Congress said that 1 percent of the ads had utilized one kind of the Custom Audiences method. \n\u201cAbout 1% of the ads used a specific type of Custom Audiences targeting to reach people on Facebook who had visited that advertiser\u2019s website or liked the advertiser\u2019s Page \u2014 as well as to reach people who are similar to those audiences,\u201d Facebook\u2019s vice president of policy and communications, Elliot Schrage, said in the update. \n\u201cNone of the ads used another type of Custom Audiences targeting based on personal information such as email addresses.\u201d \nNews of the Russians' use of the Facebook tool to target users comes amid the controversy over the website\u2019s political advertising during the 2016 campaign. Facebook admitted last month that Russians who were potentially linked to the Kremlin bought ads on the platform during the presidential race. The revelation angered liberal groups and lawmakers alike. \nFacebook on Monday said approximately 10 million people viewed political ads that were purchased by Russian actors approaching the 2016 presidential election. The company\u2019s numbers showed that 44 percent of the ads were viewed before the election, while 56 percent were viewed after the election. \nThe social media company on Monday also released more than 3,000 political ads purchased by Russian actors on its platform to congressional investigators. \nThe Senate Intelligence Committee, one of several congressional committees conducting a probe into Russia\u2019s attempts to meddle in the United States election, last week invited Facebook to testify at an upcoming hearing that will evaluate how foreign actors possibly used social media companies to influence the election.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mallory shelbourne", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "greg nash", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "custom audiences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate intelligence committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:00:47.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d3f5c3874fc16ba6cda139817ae572347e1ef0b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc56ivB84J7ei2r60i_W7tT1QdMK9EN4wfZzXWo7BfFOe7joxn62Anze6YtUxONQ3bSQ--", "site_full": "thehill.com", "site": "thehill.com", "site_section": "https://news.google.com/news/feeds?output=rss&#038;q=graffiti+street+art", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "Top Stories - Google News", "title": "Hoyer: GOP 'cowed' by NRA - The Hill", "title_full": "Hoyer: GOP 'cowed' by NRA - The Hill", "published": "2017-10-03T21:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/hoyersteny_021517gn_lead.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1472, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d3f5c3874fc16ba6cda139817ae572347e1ef0b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc56ivB84J7ei2r60i_W7tT1QdMK9EN4wfZzXWo7BfFOe7joxn62Anze6YtUxONQ3bSQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T21:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Hoyer: GOP 'cowed' by NRA - The Hill", "text": "Hoyer: GOP \u2018cowed\u2019 by NRA By Mike Lillis - 10/03/17 02:44 PM EDT 1,825 \nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) on Tuesday went after Republicans for refusing to debate gun reform, suggesting they are simply pawns of the gun lobby. \n\u201cIt is incomprehensible that the president or others would say, \u2018This is not the time to debate this,\u2019\u201d Hoyer told reporters during a news briefing. \n\u201cIs there ever a time to debate this, or are we so cowed by the [National Rifle Association] that we can\u2019t even talk about this issue and figure out how we can make America safer?\u201d ADVERTISEMENT Hoyer was hardly alone in his criticism. Democrats emerged from their weekly caucus meeting in the Capitol incensed that Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Ryan Ryan: Graham-Cassidy 'best, last chance' to repeal ObamaCare Ryan: Americans want to see Trump talking with Dem leaders Overnight Finance: CBO to release limited analysis of ObamaCare repeal bill | DOJ investigates Equifax stock sales | House weighs tougher rules for banks dealing with North Korea MORE (R-Wis.) had refused an invitation from Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), delivered Monday night, to join the Democrats in a gun-violence protest on the Capitol steps Wednesday.\n\u201cThe notion that we can\u2019t even talk about it doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d said Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.). \nThe debate over gun reform has erupted following Sunday\u2019s mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip, where a lone gunman targeted an outdoor country music festival. At least 59 people were killed and more than 500 others wounded in the deadliest mass shooting in the nation\u2019s history. \nDemocrats have responded with loud calls for tougher gun restrictions designed to block firearms sales to violent criminals and those with severe mental illness. \nPresident Trump and the Republicans have taken a decidedly different tack, arguing that it\u2019s disrespectful to the victims in Las Vegas to launch a politically charged debate over gun reform so soon after the shooting. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn John Cornyn New GOP ObamaCare repeal bill gains momentum Week ahead: Senators near deal to stabilize ObamaCare markets GOP eying 'blue slip' break to help Trump fill the courts MORE (R-Texas) said it\u2019s \u201cbeyond disgusting\u201d that Democrats would be \u201cpoliticizing this terrible tragedy.\u201d \nHoyer and most other Democrats have pushed back hard against that criticism, noting that the frequency of mass shootings around the country ensures that, by the Republicans\u2019 reasoning, no debate could ever happen. According to the Gun Violence Archive , a nonprofit group that tallies gun incidents, there were 483 mass shootings \u2014 in which four or more people are killed or injured \u2014 in 2016, and 274 to date this year. \n\u201cWhat incomprehensible logic leads one to believe that this is not the time to talk about it?\u201d Hoyer asked. \u201cIf not now, when?\u201d \nThe Democrats are pushing legislation, sponsored by Reps. Pete King (R-N.Y.) and Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), requiring unlicensed sellers at gun shows and online to screen potential buyers through an FBI database. Under current law, those screenings are required only of licensed dealers. \nIn 2013, the Senate, which was then controlled by Democrats, voted on a similar bill in response to the deadly shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. The proposal attracted 55 votes but was defeated by a Republican filibuster. House GOP leaders never took it up. \nIt appears unlikely King and Thompson's proposal would have prevented the Las Vegas massacre, as reports have indicated that the shooter had no criminal record and purchased at least some of his firearms from licensed dealers after passing a background check. \nThe Democrats, however, say that\u2019s no reason not to adopt rules that might prevent the next mass shooting. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t legislate based on the last disaster. If you take that focus, we\u2019re never going to get anywhere,\u201d Thompson said Tuesday. \u201cWe know that background checks work. We should pass those and get that done.\u201d \nThe National Rifle Association\u2019s approach to background checks has become more stringent as the group has shifted to the right in recent years. In 1999, following the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado, NRA leaders promoted universal screenings. \n\"We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show,\u201d then-NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre testified before a House Judiciary Committee subpanel at the time. \u201cNo loopholes anywhere for anyone.\u201d \nLaPierre, now head of the NRA, has since rescinded that endorsement, saying the background check system is \u201ca failure\u201d and lawmakers should focus their gun-violence prevention efforts on prosecuting violent criminals and bolstering the mental health-care system. \nThe group has not responded publicly to the shooting in Las Vegas. \nThe NRA is one of the most powerful lobbyist groups in Washington, having spent more than $52 million in the 2016 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. A large bulk of that funding benefitted Republican candidates, with more than $30 million going to support President Trump. \nRyan on Tuesday said the nation\u2019s gun violence epidemic is largely a consequence of untreated mental illness. He pointed to a mental health bill enacted last year as evidence that Congress is confronting the issue head-on \u201cto make sure that we can try and get ahead of these problems.\u201d \n\u201cThat law is now being implemented,\u201d Ryan said during a news briefing in the Capitol. \n\u201cSo I think it's important that, as we see the dust settle and we see what was behind some these tragedies, that mental health reform is a critical ingredient to making sure that we can try and prevent some of these things from happening in the past.\u201d \nThe proposal he referenced, sponsored by Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.), overwhelmingly passed the House in July of 2016, and President Obama signed the bill into law that December. The Democrats overwhelmingly supported the legislation, but warned that it\u2019s no substitute for tougher gun laws. \n\u201cFollow the money,\u201d Rep. Elizabeth Esty (D-Conn.) said Tuesday. \u201cThe NRA and the Gun Owners of America have spent a lot of money to try to change the narrative, and there\u2019s been a lack of political courage on the part of a lot of folks in Congress. \n\u201cAsk anybody in America if they think 30,000 Americans dying a year from guns is OK, if that\u2019s something we should accept as the new normal.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hill hoyer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hoyer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "greg nash", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mike lillis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tim murphy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bennie thompson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john cornyn john cornyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth esty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steny hoyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wayne lapierre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike thompson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul ryan paul ryan ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thompson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lapierre", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gop", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for responsive politics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandy hook elementary school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national rifle association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbine high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house gop", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:52:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c208b2234b3d37ca090fbc863925cf1ce7fb3e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc56ivB84J7ei2lzGFSiicKPNKdPM9RStOLfhO_odtdWfgdB9PXYdpMJ0xjyWoG9Lm5RCBFC78roTe0UacQzjd4vfjkqeBbmApdugBDvDp2OR9AxMRcRlgXf8jqSe6Ou8QXklmBL77Slwt", "site_full": "thehill.com", "site": "thehill.com", "site_section": "http://thehill.com/rss/syndicator/19109#", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "TheHill - The Hill News", "title": "Trump met with Sheldon Adelson after Las Vegas shooting: report", "title_full": "Trump met with Sheldon Adelson after Las Vegas shooting: report", "published": "2017-10-03T22:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/adelsonsheldon_051717gn2_lead.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1472, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4c208b2234b3d37ca090fbc863925cf1ce7fb3e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc56ivB84J7ei2lzGFSiicKPNKdPM9RStOLfhO_odtdWfgdB9PXYdpMJ0xjyWoG9Lm5RCBFC78roTe0UacQzjd4vfjkqeBbmApdugBDvDp2OR9AxMRcRlgXf8jqSe6Ou8QXklmBL77Slwt", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Max Greenwood", "published": "2017-10-03T22:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trump met with Sheldon Adelson after Las Vegas shooting: report", "text": "Trump met with Sheldon Adelson after Las Vegas shooting: report By Max Greenwood - 10/03/17 03:04 PM EDT 52 \nPresident Trump met with casino magnate and GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam at the White House on Monday, discussing the mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 59 people dead and more than 500 injured. \nThe Las Vegas Review-Journal reported Tuesday that the meeting at the White House had been scheduled before news of the attack on the country music festival on the Vegas strip reached Washington early Monday morning. \nThe meeting was intended as a policy discussion, but Trump and the Adelsons reportedly also discussed how to help those affected by the shooting.

A jovial Trump, seated at a table between Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 and first lady Melania Trump, repeatedly singled out elected officials and military leaders both for their efforts and for their praise of his administration. In his remarks on Rossell\u00f3, Trump appeared to be taking a veiled shot at San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, whom the president attacked over the weekend for her criticism of the federal response efforts. ADVERTISEMENT \u201cHe\u2019s not even from my party, but he started right from the beginning appreciating what we did,\u201d Trump said of Rossell\u00f3 in remarks at a National Guard base. \u201cThis governor did not play politics. He didn\u2019t play it all. He was saying it like it was and he was giving us the highest grades.\u201d Cruz attended the briefing, but sat far away from the president. Trump did not mention her during his remarks, even as he cast praise widely on other federal and territory officials for their work, including the island\u2019s representative in Congress, Jennifer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n (R). \nThe two leaders did shake hands upon Trump\u2019s arrival in Puerto Rico. \nSpeaking at the White House earlier Tuesday, Trump signaled he wanted to move past the spat. \n\u201cI think she\u2019s come back a long way. I think it\u2019s now acknowledged what a great job we\u2019ve done, and people are looking at that,\u201d he told reporters. \nTrump\u2019s Puerto Rico visit is a test of his ability to play the role of consoler in chief. \nThe president has been deeply critical of people who have questioned the federal response efforts, calling them \u201cpolitically motivated ingrates\u201d who aren\u2019t doing enough to help their communities. \nHe also blasted the \u201cpoor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help.\u201d \nOn Tuesday, however, Trump came face-to-face with survivors of the Category 4 storm. A majority of the U.S. island territory\u2019s 3.4 million citizens remain without power, adequate food and clean drinking water. Many citizens on the island have complained authorities have been slow to deliver relief supplies. \nThe president showed he will stick with his freewheeling style, even in a place facing a humanitarian crisis. \nAfter making remarks, he walked around a neighborhood damaged by the storm and shook hands with local residents. \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to work it out, have a good time,\u201d the president told one resident, having posed for a photo. \nBeforehand, he made reference to the island\u2019s $74 billion in debt, saying it might complicate federal budget requests for disaster relief. \n\u201cI hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack because we spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico, and that's fine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe saved a lot of lives.\u201d \nThe president also compared the fatality count from Hurricane Maria to that of Hurricane Katrina, which killed thousands in 2005. \n\u201cIf you looked \u2014 every death is a horror, but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with really a storm that was just totally overbearing, nobody has seen anything like this,\u201d Trump said. \n\u201cWhat is your death count as of this morning, 17?\" Trump asked. \n\u201cSixteen people certified,\u201d Rossell\u00f3 responded. \n\u201cSixteen people certified versus in the thousands,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou can be very proud of all of your people, all of our people working together. Sixteen versus literally thousands of people. You can be very proud.\u201d \nThe official death toll, however, has not been updated in nearly a week.

The Pentagon has said there are already 11,000 troops in the country. \nTrump has offered few details on his plan, beyond committing to end \u201carbitrary timetables for withdrawal\u201d and calling for India and Pakistan to lend their support in the fight against terrorist groups. \n\u201cWe want to be your partners, but this committee will not be a rubber stamp for any policy or president,\u201d McCain told the Trump officials on Tuesday. \n\u201cIt remains unclear why we should be confident that this new strategy could turn the tide in Afghanistan or bring us meaningfully closer to success than its failed predecessors.\u201d \nMcCain told Defense News he has not yet been briefed on what the 3,000 additional troops would do in the country. \nThe Arizona Republican has been a vocal critic of the administration on multiple issues, and broke with his party to oppose plans this year to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \nMcCain alluded to a possible hold on Trump's Pentagon nominees in remarks during the hearing Tuesday, pointing to several constitutionally-mandated moves lawmakers can take to force the administration\u2019s hand. \n\u201cWe will not accept a lack of information, a lack of strategy, a lack of coordination with this committee.

Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) and Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin Tammy Suzanne Baldwin Senate Dems hold floor talk-a-thon against latest ObamaCare repeal bill This week: Senate wrapping up defense bill after amendment fight Week ahead: Senate to wrap up defense bill MORE (D) were seen in the audience for arguments. \nDemocratic voters from 11 state legislative districts, led by lead plaintiff William Whitford, claim Wisconsin\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature drew the map with a discriminatory intent, violating their First Amendment right to free political speech and their 14th Amendment right to be treated equally under the law. \nUnder the maps, Republicans won 60 of the 99 seats in the state Assembly with 48.6 percent of the two-party vote in 2012 and 63 of the 99 seats with 52 percent of the vote in 2014. \nThe voters\u2019 attorney, Paul Smith, pushed back against Roberts\u2019s concerns, claiming the court must step in and resolve the issue. \n\u201cIf you let this go, if you say we\u2019re not going to have a judicial remedy for this problem, in 2020, you\u2019re going to have a festival of copycat gerrymandering the likes of which this country has never seen,\u201d he warned. \n\u201cAnd it may be that you can protect the court from seeming political, but the country is going to lose faith in democracy big time because voters everywhere are going to be like the voters in Wisconsin and [say], 'No, it really doesn\u2019t matter whether I vote.'\u201d \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wanted to know why the Wisconsin legislature settled on what she called \u201cthe most extreme\u201d partisan map when it had previous drafts to choose from. \n\u201cBut they kept going back to fix the map to make it more gerrymandered,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s undisputed.\u201d \nWisconsin Solicitor General Misha Tseytlin said there was no constitutional requirement for the state to adopt a more traditional map. \n\u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d Sotomayor said. \nAll eyes were on Justice Anthony Kennedy for the hourlong arguments, but the court\u2019s frequent swing vote gave little insight to how he could fall on the case. \nKennedy left the door open for the court to resolve the issue in a 2004 case known as Vieth v. Jubelirer if a \u201climited and precise\u201d standard could be found to determine whether an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander had occurred in redistricting. \nErin Murphy, who argued on behalf of the Wisconsin state Senate, claimed the Democratic challengers have failed to come up with a \u201cworkable standard\u201d for determining when the inherently political task of districting becomes too political for the Constitution to tolerate. \nThe standard voters have proposed, known as the \u201cefficiency gap,\u201d is calculated by taking one party\u2019s total wasted votes in an election, subtracting the other party\u2019s total wasted votes, then dividing that by the total number of votes cast. \nBut Kennedy wanted to know if it\u2019s legal for the state to have a law or constitutional amendment that says the factors in redistricting must be used in a way to favor one party over another. \nHe grew agitated when Murphy failed to directly answer if the law would be a violation of the First Amendment or the Equal Protection Clause. \nShe claimed it depends on who has standing \u2014 something the state argues the Democratic challengers in the case are lacking. \n\u201cWell, assume standing,\u201d Kennedy said, seemingly annoyed. \u201cI\u2019d like the answer to the question.\u201d \nMurphy admitted the law would be unconstitutional on its face and could be considered a violation of equal protection and the First Amendment. \nOther members of the court, meanwhile, were skeptical of whether the voter\u2019s standard was the right solution. \n\u201cGerrymandering is distasteful, but if we are going to impose a standard on the courts it has to be something that\u2019s manageable and it has to be something that\u2019s sufficiently concrete,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito said. \nAlito questioned how sufficiently the \u201cefficiency gap\u201d has been tested. \n\u201cIs this the time for us to jump into this?\u201d he asked. \u201cHas there been a great body of scholarship that has tested this efficiency gap? It\u2019s full of questions.\u201d \nThe state of Wisconsin claims a ruling affirming the lower court\u2019s decision could lead a third of all maps drawn in the last 45 years to be challenged. \nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, meanwhile, seemed to suggest that the consequences of partisan gerrymandering are too great for the court not to act. \nIf the results of elections are pre-ordained in most districts, she said, \u201cwhat becomes of the precious right to vote?\u201d \nThe court\u2019s newest justice, Neil Gorsuch, however, seemed unconvinced that the court even has jurisdiction under the Constitution to resolve the issue. \n\u201cAnd where exactly do we get authority to revise state legislative lines?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhen the Constitution authorizes the federal government to step in on state legislative matters, it\u2019s pretty clear.\u201d \nBut Smith argued that politicians like gerrymandering too much to be trusted to fix it themselves. \n\u201cWe\u2019re here telling you, you are the only institution in the United States that can solve this problem,\u201d he told the court.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lydia wheeler", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "paul smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tammy baldwin tammy suzanne baldwin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jubelirer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vieth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roberts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sotomayor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arnold schwarzenegger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruth bader ginsburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonia sotomayor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "misha tseytlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samuel alito", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john roberts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg nash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william whitford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erin murphy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murphy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alito", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T23:18:44.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "54c52d31b249accc7015af783f62c87a0e80f7d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc50feJsh5CiIFQqdYkU.v2X2hjez_d3hZL2aqCVdvtT6bd7ks3vkGp8zxQINPQ0_5CiUpwQeoddSMXzGVcpIte6s5M8c9pBKfjQBE4iwO1V64P80w0yihB5w-", "site_full": "thehill.com", "site": "thehill.com", "site_section": "http://heresalink.com/rss", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "(no title)", "title": "Outraged lawmakers demand answers at Equifax hearing", "title_full": "Outraged lawmakers demand answers at Equifax hearing", "published": "2017-10-03T22:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/lujanben_071216gn_lead.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1472, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54c52d31b249accc7015af783f62c87a0e80f7d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc50feJsh5CiIFQqdYkU.v2X2hjez_d3hZL2aqCVdvtT6bd7ks3vkGp8zxQINPQ0_5CiUpwQeoddSMXzGVcpIte6s5M8c9pBKfjQBE4iwO1V64P80w0yihB5w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T22:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Outraged lawmakers demand answers at Equifax hearing", "text": "Outraged lawmakers demand answers at Equifax hearing By Harper Neidig and Mallory Shelbourne - 10/03/17 01:31 PM EDT 7 \nLawmakers got their first crack at former Equifax CEO Richard Smith on Tuesday, bombarding him with criticism for the massive data breach that occurred on his watch. \nThe lawmakers could barely mask their anger as they pressed Smith on why the company\u2019s data security practices were inadequate, given the mass amounts of personal data the company handles. \nSmith opened his testimony with a public apology. \n\u201cThe criminal hack happened on my watch and as CEO I\u2019m ultimately responsible,\" said Smith, who retired from the company last week. \nIn one exchange with Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (D-N.M.), Smith repeatedly dodged questions about whether Equifax\u2019s response will make consumers whole. \n\u201cDo you think consumers should have to pay a penalty for your mistake, including potential identify theft, false credit accounts, fraudulent tax returns or medical identity theft?\u201d Luj\u00e1n asked. \u201cOr do you commit to compensating any consumers who suffer harm as a consequence of your breach?\u201d \n\u201cWe take this seriously,\u201d Smith responded. \u201cI\u2019ve apologized, apologized again to the American consumer. We\u2019ve offered a comprehensive set of products for free.\u201d \n\u201cMr. Smith, will those comprehensive sets of products make consumers whole?\u201d Luj\u00e1n shot back. \n\u201cIt will protect them going forward,\u201d Smith said. When Luj\u00e1n repeated the question, Smith responded, \u201cIt is hard for me to tell if someone\u2019s been harmed, so I can\u2019t answer the question.\u201d Equifax revealed the breach last month, saying that hackers had stolen personal information for 143 million people. This week, the company said that 2.5 million more people were affected by the breach than had been initially estimated. The stolen data included Social Security numbers, names, birth dates and addresses. Smith said the breach could be attributed to a \u201ccombination of human error and technological error.\u201d The company neglected to patch key software, leaving consumer data vulnerable, and Equifax\u2019s security scanners did not detect the vulnerability, Smith said. The company has since offered free credit locking services for those affected by the breach, but lawmakers have questioned whether Equifax was equipped handle the influx of consumer queries about their data. \nJoe Linus Barton GOP fights off primary challengers in deep-red Texas House lines up energy bill amendments on oil exports, pipeline permits Lawmakers press toymaker for hack details MORE (R-Texas) suggested that organizations like Equifax should pay a fine for every customer that\u2019s affected by data breaches. \n\u201cWe could have this hearing every year from now on if we don\u2019t do something to change the current system,\u201d said Barton, a founding member of the bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus. \n\u201cSo I would hope that you\u2019d go back to your peers and work with the committee chairman and the subcommittee chairman, ranking member, and let\u2019s figure out something to do that actually gives an incentive to the industry to protect ourselves,\u201d he added. Equifax has also faced questions about why two of its executives sold large amounts of stock before the breach became public. Smith said the extent of the breach was not known when they made the sales. \nSmith's testimony Tuesday before a House subcommittee is just the start of his time on Capitol Hill this week; he'll be testifying before three more committees. \n\u201cMr. Smith, it seems to me that you\u2019ve accomplished something that no one else has been able to accomplish,\u201d said Rep.

Threaten to veto it if he must and put an end to that bill,\" Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday on the Senate floor. \nRepublicans, on the other hand, are urging Democrats not to politicize the shooting. \n\"Politicizing this terrible tragedy is, I think, beyond disgusting,\" Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ryan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steve scalise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul ryan paul ryan ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john cornyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff duncan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scalise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "olivia beavers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national rifle association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sportsmen heritage", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "va.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T23:34:50.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9383a1019865baef91dd360a810520dd93f7670a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc5yXCSZON.8ssabyjKlCUC.csjDCRSAnV2se.nxxWnfXVla.cErj7LBrxqkmWFR_ZfFWXnlQIUtOBgotpLR0UOo6xYCjJwDSSUBzzQ_fxfWzaDo6k0oYIpCE-", "site_full": "thehill.com", "site": "thehill.com", "site_section": "http://thehill.com/taxonomy/term/1131/feed", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "The Hill: House", "title": "Dem blasts moments of silence after mass shootings as 'grisly House ritual'", "title_full": "Dem blasts moments of silence after mass shootings as 'grisly House ritual'", "published": "2017-10-03T19:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/clarkkatherine_120915gn_lead.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1472, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9383a1019865baef91dd360a810520dd93f7670a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc5yXCSZON.8ssabyjKlCUC.csjDCRSAnV2se.nxxWnfXVla.cErj7LBrxqkmWFR_ZfFWXnlQIUtOBgotpLR0UOo6xYCjJwDSSUBzzQ_fxfWzaDo6k0oYIpCE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cmarcos@thehill.com (Cristina Marcos)", "published": "2017-10-03T19:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dem blasts moments of silence after mass shootings as 'grisly House ritual'", "text": "Dem blasts moments of silence after mass shootings as 'grisly House ritual'   10/03/17 12:26 PM EDT 8,577 \u00a9 Greg Nash \nRep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) on Tuesday expressed frustration with lawmakers observing a moment of silence in response to the mass shooting in Las Vegas, calling it a \u201cgrisly House ritual.\u201d \nThe House held a brief moment of silence Monday evening for the victims of the massacre in Las Vegas the night before, which killed 59 people and injured more than 500 others. \nClark was among multiple House Democrats who have refused to participate in any more moments of silence on the floor to honor victims of gun violence out of frustration with the lack of a legislative response. \nClark lamented the number of moments of silence in recent years following a series of deadly shootings. She was among the Democrats who led a sit-in on the House floor last June to protest inaction after the shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., which until Sunday night was the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. ADVERTISEMENT \u201cWe\u2019ve had our grisly House ritual of expressing our heartfelt grief, followed by a moment of silence. But the moments have extended into years. Families at home did not send us here for our thoughts and prayers. No one in this chamber was elected to tackle our country\u2019s challenges with moments of silence,\u201d Clark said in a House floor speech.\nClark and Reps. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) and Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) began boycotting moments of silence after the Orlando shooting last year and did so again on Monday. \n\u201cLast year after the shooting at the Pulse nightclub, I decided in desperation that I would not participate in any more moments of silence in this chamber. That prayers and sympathy are fine. But this room can fix this problem and this room and the people in it refuse to do so,\u201d Himes said in a separate floor speech on Tuesday. \nHouse Republicans had been trying to push a bill titled the Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement (SHARE) Act, which would broaden public access to federal lands for hunting and fishing. \nIt includes a provision authored by Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) that would make it easier to buy gun silencers, which currently requires registration and a background check. Duncan\u2019s proposal would require people buying gun silencers, also known as suppressors, to undergo a less extensive instant background check. \n\u201cThe leadership of this House is so enamored with silence that one of the only policies that they will talk about is silencing guns,\u201d Clark said. \nDuncan told reporters outside the House chamber Monday night that the timing for the bill was unclear. \n\u201cWe anticipated next week, but who knows now,\u201d Duncan said. \nPaul Ryan The Hill Interview: Budget Chair Black sticks around for now Gun proposal picks up GOP support GOP lawmaker Tim Murphy to retire at end of term MORE (R-Wis.) said Tuesday at a GOP leadership press conference that the legislation was not currently set for consideration.

In a letter to Democratic and Republican leaders in both chambers, the coalition of drugmakers, insurers and others in the health sector is seeking a federal reinsurance program or a grant program to provide money for state-led reinsurance programs. ADVERTISEMENT Reinsurance programs help cover the costs of sicker customers. The letter comes a week after Republicans abandoned their effort to repeal ObamaCare for the time being. For 2018 CAHC recommends $15 billion phased down over four years, but estimates the federal cost for state-based risk reduction programs would actually be much less \u2014 about $4 billion. That\u2019s because, CAHC wrote, premiums would be reduced, and that means the amount of money the federal government pays to help people better afford their premiums would decrease. The council is also seeking the repeal of ObamaCare taxes on health care and insurance providers, reforms to the state-innovation waiver process and as much as $4 billion in grants for reinsurance programs under state-innovations waivers, among other measures. \u201cMajor modifications are needed to the ACA to address the ongoing losses in coverage and access, and increase in premiums and cost sharing,\u201d the council wrote in the letter sent Monday afternoon. \u201cWhile the policies presented here only represent a small number of options that should be considered to improve our health system, we believe these can help achieve the goals outlined by policy makers of lowering health costs and improving access in a consumer-centered, market-driven way.\u201d The council is composed of members throughout the health care sphere, such as those representing pharmaceutical manufacturers, insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, patient groups, small and large employers, and others.

The legislation is the first Republican request to direct extra Medicaid money to Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria. The island is still trying to deal with the severe damage it received from the storm. The legislation from the House Energy and Commerce Committee mirrors a bipartisan proposal in the Senate Finance Committee, but it also includes some potentially controversial offsets. For example, the House bill would repeal ObamaCare's public health prevention fund and raise Medicare rates for wealthy seniors. ADVERTISEMENT No Democrats have signed on to the bill ahead of a markup on Wednesday . The committee's ranking member Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) said in a statement the parties are still working toward a bipartisan agreement. \n\"While bipartisan negotiations have been ongoing, the legislation offered last night by Chairman [Greg] Walden [R-Ore.] is not a bipartisan agreement,\" Pallone said. Democrats in Congress have demanded a Puerto Rico aid package, but the Trump administration has yet to propose one. President Trump is scheduled to visit the island Tuesday , and has defended the federal government\u2019s slow response to the storm. Puerto Rico already faces a Medicaid funding cliff, because $6.5 billion in one-time funds from ObamaCare ran out at the end of the fiscal year. Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories is capped, meaning they receive less money than the rest of the country. A GOP aide said the $1 billion in the legislation is related to the funding cliff. The money would be provided to Puerto Rico over two years, and is part of a larger committee package to reauthorize CHIP, community health centers and other expiring health-care programs. Congress missed a Sept. 30 deadline to extend funding for those programs. Some states have some money left to carry over until Congress acts, but three states and the District of Columbia will run out by the end of the year. \nThe Senate Finance Committee will also have a markup on their bill Wednesday, but so far the committee has yet to release details about how it would pay for a CHIP extension.

Niki Tsongas (D-Mass.) about Iran's and Russia\u2019s support for the Taliban, Mattis said that Iran is \u201cdoing what it usually does\u201d in sowing regional chaos.

John Nicholson, told senators the Russian support entailed trying to legitimize the Taliban by spreading a narrative that the Taliban is fighting the Afghan branch of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. \nIn April, Nicholson also said adamantly that he was \u201cnot refuting\u201d reports that Russia is supplying weapons to the Taliban. \nSpeaking alongside Nicholson, Mattis said at the time that the United States would have to confront any such violation of international law. \nRussia has repeatedly denied claims it\u2019s supplying the Taliban, saying that such allegations are \u201cfabrications\u201d and \u201cutterly false.\u201d \nOn Tuesday, Mattis said it\u2019s in neither Russia's nor Iran\u2019s interest to support the Taliban, which is what makes their support puzzling. \n\u201cIran\u2019s had their diplomats killed by Taliban,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cRussia certainly has had enough problems coming out of terrorism in south central Asia. So this doesn\u2019t make sense, but then the world doesn\u2019t always make sense.

ADVERTISEMENT Trump tried out the familiar consoler-in-chief role during his visit, but at times appeared more concerned with portraying the response effort as a victory for his administration while rebutting criticism that it has been too slow.\nTrump repeatedly brought up how his administration\u2019s response to Puerto Rico would be graded as he lavished praise on federal and local officials. \n\u201cEvery death is a horror,\u201d the president told officials. \u201cBut if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering \u2014 nobody has ever seen anything like this.\u201d \nAs he passed out flashlights to hurricane victims, Trump said \u201cyou don\u2019t need \u2018em anymore\u201d \u2014 even as much of the island remains without power. \nTrump singled out Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 (D) for \u201cgiving us the highest grades\u201d and noted he \u201cdid not play politics.\u201d \nBut he pointedly left out the mayor of San Juan, who had become one of the loudest voices criticizing his administration\u2019s disaster-relief efforts. \nThe president will face a new test on Wednesday when he visits Las Vegas, where a gunman killed at least 59 people on Sunday in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. \nThe president\u2019s remarks about the cost of the natural disaster and his Hurricane Katrina comparison angered Democrats, who accused him of offering a tone-deaf response to residents who are suffering. \n\u201cI wish he would stop talking about money,\u201d Rep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez (D-Ill.), who is of Puerto Rican descent, told CNN. \u201cWhat\u2019s a human life worth? How do you put that on the scorecard? There is no cost that you can put on a human life.\u201d \nGuti\u00e9rrez also cautioned that the official death toll could climb higher. Large swaths of the island, particularly its more mountainous regions, lack running water and adequate food supplies. \nAt a military base near San Juan, Trump appeared to be in high-spirits as he joked around with government officials during his first stop on the island. He even took a crack at Puerto Rico\u2019s $74 billion debt, which he suggested has complicated the response. \n\u201cI hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack because we spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico, and that's fine, we saved a lot of lives,\u201d Trump said. \nCharles (Chuck) Ellis Schumer Senate Dems hold floor talk-a-thon against latest ObamaCare repeal bill This week: Senate wrapping up defense bill after amendment fight Cuomo warns Dems against cutting DACA deal with Trump MORE (D-N.Y.) fired back at Trump from the Senate floor, demanding he \u201cstop blaming Puerto Rico for the storm that devastated their shores.\u201d \nThe top Democrat accused Trump of holding the territory to a different standard than Texas and Florida, which suffered tremendous damage from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. \n\u201cYes, we\u2019re spending money in Puerto Rico,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWe\u2019re spending money to turn the power back on. To give people drinking water. And to keep life support machines working in the hospitals. And that\u2019s what we do in America. ... And Puerto Rico should be just the same.\u201d \nWhile he did not mention her in his remarks, Trump avoided a public confrontation with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz at a briefing with local and federal officials. \nThe two leaders shook hands before the event. \u201cHow\u2019re you?\u201d Trump asked. Cruz told Trump that \u201cit\u2019s not about politics.\u201d Trump appeared to mouth \u201cthank you.\u201d \nCruz last week accused the administration of \u201ckilling us with the inefficiency,\u201d prompting Trump to respond on Twitter the real problem is \u201cpoor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help.\u201d \nMeanwhile, Trump received cover from Rossell\u00f3 and Puerto Rico\u2019s representative in Congress, Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n (R). \n\u201cThe amount of devastation is unheard of. But during all this time, we got the federal government by our side doing their job for the people here,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez. \u201cThank you, Mr. President, for all you\u2019ve done for the island.\u201d \nTrump\u2019s visit to the island with filled with colorful moments. \nAt the Cavalry Chapel in Guaynabo, Trump was cheered for passing out paper towels by pretending to shoot them into a basketball hoop. He and Melania Trump walked the streets of Guaynabo meeting with victims of the hurricane. \nOne family told the first lady they had been trapped in their homes. \n\u201cYou know who helped them? God helped them,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat's right.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jonathan easley", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "luis guti\u00e9rrez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmen yul\u00edn cruz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ricardo rossell\u00f3", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melania trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer gonz\u00e1lez-col\u00f3n", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gonz\u00e1lez-col\u00f3n", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cruz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guti\u00e9rrez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cuomo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cavalry chapel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ellis schumer senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan fabian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guaynabo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rossell\u00f3", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:19:34.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6880d7bc932d08e4b5899d41c8b1be9b8cacef1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc56ivB84J7ei2uUz6yY8h8tVMsvYXuP0MYM_tJ5XS__GSgGW.CQX8rwY8.ktStBw3e0P.JQUS6wtyqpKVk7Bqlf5QvyOHAGqOhgbii1Z2xiR4", "site_full": "thehill.com", "site": "thehill.com", "site_section": "http://thehill.com/rss/syndicator/19109#", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "TheHill - The Hill News", "title": "Top Dem demands answers: Did Price pay back for private travel?", "title_full": "Top Dem demands answers: Did Price pay back for private travel?", "published": "2017-10-03T23:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/murraypatty_060617gn_lead.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1472, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6880d7bc932d08e4b5899d41c8b1be9b8cacef1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdZwf.EhKc56ivB84J7ei2uUz6yY8h8tVMsvYXuP0MYM_tJ5XS__GSgGW.CQX8rwY8.ktStBw3e0P.JQUS6wtyqpKVk7Bqlf5QvyOHAGqOhgbii1Z2xiR4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nathaniel Weixel", "published": "2017-10-03T23:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Top Dem demands answers: Did Price pay back for private travel?", "text": "Top Dem demands answers: Did Price pay back for private travel?

Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.) later this month, a move that could earn Pittenger both a boosted campaign treasury and criticism from his primary rival. Rove plans to attend two fundraisers for Pittenger on Oct. 16 \u2014 a lunch at The Palm steakhouse in Charlotte and a reception at a private home later that evening \u2014 according to a copy of the fundraising invitation obtained by The Hill. The former deputy chief of staff under President George W. Bush is one of the GOP's most famous strategists and helped start a handful of powerful Republican outside groups. But he's not been a frequent critic of President Trump, arguing in June that he \"lacks the focus or self-discipline to do the basic work required of a president.\" Pittenger has supported some of Trump's most controversial moves in office, commending him for decisions to nix the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and withdrawing from the Paris climate accord. He's also voted with the president's position almost 98 percent of the time, according to data tracked by FiveThirtyEight. But his primary opponent, Pastor Mark Harris, is criticizing Pittenger for appearing with a Trump critic who has a strained relationship with the GOP grass roots. Harris and Pittenger ran one of the closest primary races in the entire 2016 cycle. The incumbent edged out Harris by under 200 votes, and now Harris is running again. Pittenger outperformed Trump in the district during the November general election \u2014 he won by 16 points compared with Trump's about 11 point margin. But Trump remains popular among Republican primary voters, so Harris will likely seize on the fundraiser to try to peel off some of Pittenger's supporters. Andy Yates, a Harris campaign strategist who is a partner with the North Carolina-based Red Dome Group, told The Hill in a statement that the Pittenger fundraiser draws \"battle lines.\" \"It is very interesting that Pittenger would bring in Rove who is very vocally anti-Trump (Rove along with John Kasich are probably the face of the anti-Trumpers left in the Republican party) when Pittenger has gone to such great lengths to try to portray himself as a Trump fan and a Trump advocate,\" Yates said in an email. \"I'm not sure how Robert can bring Rove in to raise money but still try to portray himself as pro-Trump,\" he said.

terrorists, often pointing to the operation launched in 2014 to clear groups such as the Haqqanis from the Waziristan border region with Afghanistan. \nBut at the Tuesday morning Senate Armed Services

By Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), Opinion Contributor \u2014 10/03/17 08:30 AM   16 \u00a9 Getty Images \nOn Tuesday, President Trump will travel to Puerto Rico to survey the damage caused by Hurricane Maria and inspect his administration\u2019s woefully inadequate recovery efforts. \nHe may give a speech, just as President Bush did in New Orleans after his administration failed miserably to prepare for and respond to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. \nThe question is whether President Trump will make the same commitment President Bush made to these American citizens \u2014 to fully restore and even improve their communities. \nIn 2005, President Bush opened his speech with a patriotic proclamation: \u201cAll who question the future of the Crescent City need to know: There is no way to imagine America without New Orleans, and this great city will rise again.\u201d \nHe then promised: \u201cwhen communities are rebuilt, they must be even better and stronger than before the storm.\u201d \nHe dismissed any notion that the region should receive less support because it suffered from decades of poverty: \u201cAs all of us saw on television, there is also some deep, persistent poverty in this region as well. That poverty has roots in a history of racial discrimination, which cut off generations from the opportunity of America.\u201d \nHe urged the American people to come together: \u201cWe have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action. So let us restore all that we have cherished from yesterday, and let us rise above the legacy of inequality.\u201d \nAcknowledging his administration\u2019s failures, he conceded: \u201cAmericans have every right to expect a more effective response in a time of emergency.\u201d \nHe concluded: \u201cWhen the federal government fails to meet such an obligation, I as president am responsible for the problem, and for the solution.\u201d \nThe people of Puerto Rico are American citizens who deserve the same commitment from their leader, but President Trump has shown no such inclination to date. \nRetired Lt. General Russel L. Honore, who commanded Joint Task Force Katrina, observed that this is \u201creplaying a scene from Katrina.\u201d Coast Guard Commandant Paul Zukunft asked the same question the people of Puerto Rico are asking: \u201cWhere is the cavalry?\u201d \nYet, President Trump and his top aides have been spinning a web of alternative facts, claiming that their response has received \u201ctremendous reviews,\u201d that \u201cwe\u2019re very proud of it,\u201d and that \u201ceverybody has said it\u2019s amazing the job we are doing there.\u201d \nOn Friday, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke said the administration\u2019s response has been a \u201cgood news story.\u201d \nStunned by this claim, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn responded: \n\u201cWhen you\u2019re drinking from a creek, it\u2019s not a good news story. When you don\u2019t have food for a baby, it\u2019s not a good news story. When you have to pull people down from buildings \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, that really upsets me and frustrates me. \u2026 Dammit, this is not a good news story. This is a \u2018people are dying\u2019 story. This is a life-or-death story.\u201d \nInstead of acknowledging this deep frustration, President Trump took to Twitter and publicly accused the mayor of \u201cpoor leadership.\u201d He then derided the Puerto Rican people, who he claimed \u201cwant everything to be done for them.\u201d \nInstead of comforting these American citizens and committing to a robust rebuilding effort, he cited Puerto Rico\u2019s historical financial struggles and warned that it is \u201cin debt to Wall Street and the banks.\u201d \nInstead of admitting his administration\u2019s own deficient efforts, he blamed Puerto Rico\u2019s infrastructure and even its geography, observing: \u201cThis is an island surrounded by water. Big water. Ocean water.\u201d \nInstead of learning from the mistakes of Katrina \u2014 as our nation did in response to the earthquake on the nearby island of Haiti in 2010 \u2014 President Trump left work early on Friday to head off for a weekend at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey. \nWhen President Trump lands in Puerto Rico on Tuesday, the American families who are struggling to survive there will want to hear one thing: The American people stick together, and we have your back. We will help you build a stronger infrastructure, and we will help you rebuild your communities even better than they were before. \nWe promise. \nRep.

Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), who has come under scrutiny for his sympathetic views toward Moscow, reportedly met last year with Natalia Veselnitskaya, the same Russian lawyer embroiled in Donald Trump Jr.'s controversial meeting at Trump Tower. \nRohrabacher's meeting came two months before Veselnitskaya's meeting with the president's eldest son. He has also met with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who during the 2016 campaign published leaked Democratic emails the intelligence community says were hacked by Russia. \nTrump Jr. took the meeting last year in New York after being promised damaging information on Hillary Clinton , though he has denied that any was delivered. \nThe California lawmaker, who has largely supported improving relations between Washington and Moscow, met with the lawyer in April 2016 to discuss the U.S. sanctions against Russia that were in response to the Kremlin's human rights abuses. Veselnitskaya lobbied against the punitive measure, known as the Magnitsky Act. \nVeselnitskaya disclosed the previously unknown meeting during a Tuesday interview with a pro-Russian Crimean news service, Foreign Policy reported. \n\"We just asked to listen to us, just to listen to the alternative version,\" Veselnitskaya reportedly said, while slamming the sanctions and claiming lawmakers like Rohrabacher had been deceived with such measures. \n\"'Do not let yourself be used by scammers,'\" she recalled saying. \nKenneth Grubbs, a spokesman for Republican lawmaker, told the magazine that he believed the Russian lawyer was \"among many people\" Rohrabacher met with during his trip to Moscow, in which he led a congressional delegation. \nGrubbs also told Foreign Policy that Rohrabacher \"was not focused on her identity\" and did not recall the meeting. \nRohrabacher's trip and his willingness to hear arguments against the Magnitsky case have previously been reported. \n\"I had a meeting with some people, government officials, and they were saying, 'Would you be willing to accept material on the Magnitsky case from the prosecutors in Moscow?' And I said, 'Sure, I'd be willing to look at it,' \" Rohrabacher recalled in an interview with The Hill in July. \nDemocrats have called for Rohrabacher to be replaced as chairman over a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee over his ties to Russia. \nThe new report comes as special counsel Robert Mueller's probe for the Justice Department appears to be picking up steam as he asks the White House to turn over all documents related to the Trump Tower meeting and initial, misleading statements on it from the Trump family . \nTrump Jr. has become a key figure in the various Russia probes following reports of the meeting. \nIn addition to Mueller, multiple congressional committees are investigating the Kremlin's election interference and any possible coordination with the Trump campaign.

He graduated from California State University, Northridge in 1977. He also worked as a defense contractor in the late 1980s. \nIn 2016, Paddock moved to Mesquite, Nev, after living in Mesquite, Texas, from 2004 to 2012. He also had lived in Reno, Nev., and moved back and forth between California and Texas between the late 1990s and early 2000s. \nAuthorities have not identified a motive for the massacre Sunday night in Las Vegas, which is the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, with 59 people dead and more than 500 people injured. \nPaddock, who had no prior criminal record, is suspected of firing on attendees at a country music concert from the 32nd floor of a nearby hotel, where police found him dead and recovered 23 weapons.
