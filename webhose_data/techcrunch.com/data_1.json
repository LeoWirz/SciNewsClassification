Initially starting as a hobby to grow vegetables he couldn\u2019t find in the United States, Cohen\u2019s rooftop garden has now morphed into a startup that\u2019s raised $2.4 million in a financing round led by Resolute Venture. It starts at $249, with a pre-sale of $199 starting first. The company then hopes to have an accompanying recurring model where you get seeds and such over time, giving it a continuous business for everyone that ends up buying a planter. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was doing, but being an engineer this made me think there\u2019s a better way to do it,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason I need to do conflations in my head when we can sense when I should plant my tomatoes. It made me think we could develop a vertically integrated solution, a smart planter that has some sensors and auto irrigation \u2014 which can make it hard for people to figure out whether you\u2019re watering too much or too little \u2014 and give them advice using all these sensors.\u201d \nGROW, at its heart, is a planter. You buy it, put soil in it, lay down some seeds, and in theory harvest some greens from it eventually. But like many other techy approaches to traditional hobbies led by founders who build techy approaches to traditional hobbies, the GROW planter is designed to help you handle any speedbumps (or inexperience) to ensure that your gardening process still ends up with something that ends up on your plate. GROW sends over seeds, soil, and nutrients, and tracks everything to ensure the environment stays healthy. \nThis then feeds into your phone, which gets a microclimate profile and the best advice for how to manage your plants and ensure they end up with something you can actually eat. Each plant has a kit, and the hope is that the company can figure out which vegetables are most likely to be successful in your climate. Then, you get seeds or seedlings, as well as nutrients, through the life cycle of the plant and instructions as you go along. \nHere\u2019s the kicker, though: the barrier to entry for something like this is going to be pretty high, and not because of the price. GROW requires a water source for its irrigation, which means if that\u2019s not handy this won\u2019t be something for you just yet. All this means that GROW is, at least initially, going to be a niche product for those with an itch for gardening and the resources to build a more robust garden otherwise. While Cohen may have worked with this idea from a rooftop to begin, the whole concept is to reduce the initial effort required to tap into that latent green thumb \u2014 but that means starting with the most accessible audience first. \nThe whole process still required a bit of a balance between making it automated and easy and still accounting for the zen that comes with gardening. It takes away the everyday ritual of watering, which might be something that you\u2019re into doing as a cool-off-from-work kind of thing, but that\u2019s intentional because the goal is to actually get vegetables growing and helping you actually pick something healthy. That\u2019s just one example of a careful balancing act that GROW had to take, which we\u2019ll have to see play out before we know whether or not the planter finds that sweet spot. \nGROW is also starting off as something that\u2019s only for sale on GROW\u2019s website. The company might end up in retail stores, but that\u2019s further down the timeline \u2014 as it\u2019s something that can lead to a ton of challenges for a company that\u2019s building a hard physical product that people will buy. \u201cWe definitely learned that mistake at Boxee, and as soon as we went to retail it became much harder to keep it as a leader,\u201d Cohen said. \n\u201cWhen you hand off the relationships, you don\u2019t own the salespeople,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIt becomes hard to control the message. When you control the whole funnel, basically the journey from coming to a website down to supporting the customer through usage, it\u2019s much easier online. One of the lessons is we\u2019re not gonna move [into retail] quickly.\u201d \nThere\u2019s going to be plenty of competition for GROW. There are a lot of companies attempting the kind of let\u2019s-grow-real-plants-in-climates-where-they-don\u2019t-necessarily-belong projects, like Agricool, which just raised $9.1 million . Starting off with a niche, GROW is going to have to make a very good product that consumes the entire wants of that niche and then eventually expand to other low hanging fruit (like a table in an apartment, hint hint). GROW is also going to have to make sure it delivers on those continuous touchpoints and work with customers throughout the entire growing cycle of their plants. \u201cBuilding hardware wasn\u2019t easy, but these days hardware has a lot of advantages,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThe world of consumer software is so saturated and noisy. Hardware has the advantage of building slowly a customer base of people paying hard dollars. The main lesson I\u2019ve learned in building products is to build one with a service layer. Some kind of recurring revenue is very important.\u201d 0 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "boxee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cohen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idan cohen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "resolute venture", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agricool", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boxee", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:04:43.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "20a3e2d0035b084030f6282078e34eaa299df427", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.nq6xjv7R6IVRv7OksnPIy3aDOVd8iLmnIg6dairb0veh3pzvp9oOZaqJk60M6z24z96mP_ONjD2OabdZ6ONlAwEpAcT5EL_eZxZBsSjn4pObyNW3hK7OM9hAkmEEhKhHKNyc4Zv.q_B8wX701EbU6E", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TechCrunch", "title": "N26, Revolut and Monzo founders to talk about starting a bank from scratch at Disrupt Berlin", "title_full": "N26, Revolut and Monzo founders to talk about starting a bank from scratch at Disrupt Berlin", "published": "2017-10-03T13:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/n26-revolut-monzo.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 263, "comments": 0, "shares": 263}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 939}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "20a3e2d0035b084030f6282078e34eaa299df427", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.nq6xjv7R6IVRv7OksnPIy3aDOVd8iLmnIg6dairb0veh3pzvp9oOZaqJk60M6z24z96mP_ONjD2OabdZ6ONlAwEpAcT5EL_eZxZBsSjn4pObyNW3hK7OM9hAkmEEhKhHKNyc4Zv.q_B8wX701EbU6E", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Romain Dillet", "published": "2017-10-03T13:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "N26, Revolut and Monzo founders to talk about starting a bank from scratch at Disrupt Berlin", "text": "N26, Revolut and Monzo founders to talk about starting a bank from scratch at Disrupt Berlin Posted Envoy Global raises $21 million to help companies employ immigrants What do N26, Revolut and Monzo have in common? The three founders of those three startups are all coming to TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin to discuss all things fintech. If you want to see Valentin Stalf , Nikolay Storonsky and Tom Blomfield share the same stage, come to Disrupt in December. \nN26 also happens to be a Startup Battlefield success story. The company participated in our startup competition back in 2014. And things have changed quite a lot since then as the company has raised tens of millions of euros, attracted half a million customers and launched across the Eurozone. \nStalf is graduating from the Startup Battlefield segment and coming back to talk on the main stage. This is exactly why Disrupt Berlin showcases startups at all stages. \nRevolut is also a huge success, especially in its home country. According to the company\u2019s website , there are now more than 850,000 people using Revolut. \nBut Revolut is also a very different beast. The company isn\u2019t technically a bank. It started off as an electronic wallet app with super cheap exchange rates. Slowly but surely, the company has been adding new features that make it act more and more like a bank account. Now, Revolut also provides personal IBANs, a credit feature, business accounts, travel insurance and phone insurance. \nFinally, Monzo is catching up after a late start. The startup also has hundreds of thousands of customers and a banking license . And this just in the U.K. alone. I\u2019ve seen countless of friends opening a Monzo account. \nSwitching from a traditional bank to Monzo offers many benefits. You get real-time alerts of transactions, geotagged transactions, bill-splitting features, real-time transfers between Monzo users and an app that simply doesn\u2019t suck. It provides some great budgeting features. \nThese three awesome speakers all think that retail banks have been too greedy and too slow. It\u2019s time to let users control their money from their phone. In fact, sending money should probably be as easy as sending a tweet. And they all have different yet interesting ways of solving the same problem. \nGet your Disrupt tickets right now to save 30 percent off of your tickets and see Valentin Stalf, Nikolay Storonsky and Tom Blomfield. You\u2019ll also see the Startup Battlefield competition, in which a handful of startups pitch our judges with the hopes of winning the coveted Disrupt Cup and a cash prize. \nYou\u2019ll get to chat with plenty of promising startups in Startup Alley, see amazing talks on the main stage, and unwind after a long day at the show with a cocktail and some new friends at the Disrupt after party. \nDo you run a startup?

With today\u2019s investment, the company has raised $45 million.\nAtScale founder and CEO Dave Mariani was one of the big data pioneers at Yahoo in the 2009 and 2010 timeframe and he saw a big problem with big data. He was able to use Hadoop, which was originally developed at Yahoo about that time, to extract big data, but when it came to translating that much data for business users, there was a problem.\nIt required taking the data and reducing the scope to make it useable for the business intelligence tools that line of business employees were using. \u201cI spent my time making data small for analytics. It was like sipping data through a straw,\u201d Mariani explained. He felt it was a wrong-headed approach, and as more companies faced the same issue, he saw a business opportunity if he could figure out a solution.\n\u201cA sense of urgency comes from [big data] pioneers who took a leap to big data and implemented Hadoop. They have this \u2018Oh shit!\u2019 moment where they realize none of their BI tools can talk to this, and they can\u2019t provide any value. They are looking for a solution to that problem,\u201d he said.\nAtScale purports to solve all of that by providing a middleware type of solution. It allows companies who have been dealing with data snapshots, instead of the whole picture, to present the data to BI tools in such a way that they don\u2019t have to settle for that small data view.\n\u201cWe take a bunch of data silos and put a semantic layer across the data platforms and expose them in a consistent way,\u201d Mariani said. That allows companies to see all of the data without cutting it into small chunks to make it work across these disparate sources.\nWhile data is the lifeblood of any organization, Mariani says that companies like Home Depot, Allstate, Kraft-Heinz and American Express have been willing to take a chance with a startup because there simply are no big companies solving this problem right now and there is a real pain point inside these companies.\nThe company launched in 2013, and they have been selling the solution since 2016. They currently have 95 employees, but that is likely to increase over the next given the new influx of capital.\nFeatured Image: RapidEye/Getty Images 0\nSHARES Advertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hadoop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave mariani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mariani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraft-heinz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "home depot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american express", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yahoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allstate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "storm ventures", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "comcast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wells fargo and industry ventures", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "atlantic bridge", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:47:08.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fb97f4c1c8218a90e4a9abd1fc3fdfd7a2d18080", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.lElfSKpUfA62tNEyiJa1R8oC9GXl7t4D69XH9nQUPyg5IqBvOObmwGoqPUm115XkZ1SHGcK2rtl9reiBbovazu", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TechCrunch", "title": "Nura\u2019s sound adapting headphones are now available for $399", "title_full": "Nura\u2019s sound adapting headphones are now available for $399", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/dscf2362.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 149, "comments": 0, "shares": 149}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 76}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fb97f4c1c8218a90e4a9abd1fc3fdfd7a2d18080", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.lElfSKpUfA62tNEyiJa1R8oC9GXl7t4D69XH9nQUPyg5IqBvOObmwGoqPUm115XkZ1SHGcK2rtl9reiBbovazu", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brian Heater", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nura\u2019s sound adapting headphones are now available for $399", "text": "Nura\u2019s sound adapting headphones are now available for $399 Posted Investors place $25M on AtScale to get the big picture of big data Nura\u2019s come a long way since last June . Back when the hardware company last stopped by our offices, its headphones were giant, like a pair of old library headphones recreated on a 3D printer. Their innards were splayed out next to them in a separate control box. It seemed impossible that the company would be able to fit all of that into a reasonably sized set of cans. Last month, however, the company stopped by a different office with the final version of its shipping product. They look even better than the mockups the company showed off a while back \u2014 $4.6 million in seed funding on top of an $1.8 million Kickstarter campaign will do that. The all-black, aluminum and stainless steel over-ear headphones with silicone earbuds are hitting retail today, priced at $399. They\u2019re weird looking \u2014 and expensive. And their promise of creating a custom sound for a listener\u2019s unique ear shape certainly isn\u2019t a new one \u2014 a number of companies like JBL have attempted some version of this over the years. But the product\u2019s calibration system does a really impressive job tailoring the sound through the app. According to the company, the headphones send out a signal designed to vibrate hair cells within the ear, which then send back an \u201dotoacoustic emission.\u201d The received sound is what the system uses to calibrate the headphone settings based on an individual\u2019s ear architecture and hearing. I had a quick demo with the product in our San Francisco office just ahead of Disrupt, and the difference before and after the app\u2019s quick calibration is pretty staggering. It\u2019s a much fuller, richer sound, and the headphones\u2019 bizarre design add a bed of bass accompanying the sound that\u2019s delivered directly through the bud. I only had relatively short time with the headphones, but it\u2019s a pretty impressive experience. We also pulled in a coworker to test the calibration on her ears. Switching back and forth between two different configurations gives you a pretty good idea of just how much ears and hearing differ from person to person. Trying out another person\u2019s customized setting was like listening to music underwater. Nura\u2019s put a lot of thought into its first product, from the design to the claimed 20 hours of battery \u2014 though $399 is a pretty steep price for a set of headphones from an unproven startup.

He had originally complained to the Irish data protection commissioner (DPC), asking it to suspend data flows in Facebook\u2019s case. But while the DPC agreed there are legal questions over the mechanism it decided to refer the issue to the High Court to consider the legality of SCCs as a whole.\nThe five-week court hearing in what is a complex case delving into detail on US surveillance operations took place in February . The court issued its ruling today.\nThe 153-page ruling starts by noting \u201cthis is an unusual case\u201d, before going into a detailed discussion of the arguments and concluding that the DPC\u2019s concerns about the validity of SCCs should be referred to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.\nSchrems is also the man responsible for bringing, in 2013, a legal challenge that ultimately struck down Safe Harbor \u2014 the legal mechanism that had oiled the pipe for EU-US personal data flows for fifteen years before the ECJ ruled it to be invalid in October 2015 .\nSchrems\u2019 argument had centered on U.S. government mass surveillance programs, as disclosed via the Snowden leaks, being incompatible with fundamental European privacy rights. After the ECJ struck down Safe Harbor he then sought to apply the same arguments against Facebook\u2019s use of SCCs \u2014 returning to Ireland to make the complaint as that\u2019s where the company has its European HQ.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the European Commission has since replaced Safe Harbor with a new (and it claims more robust) data transfer mechanism, called the EU-US Privacy Shield \u2014 which is now, as Safe Harbor was, used by thousands of businesses. Although that too is facing legal challenges as critics continue to argue there is a core problem of incompatibility between two distinct legal regimes where EU privacy rights collide with US mass surveillance.\nSchrems\u2019 Safe Harbor challenge also started in the Irish Court before being ultimately referred to the ECJ. So there\u2019s more than a little legal deja vu here, especially given the latest development in the case.\nIn its ruling on the SCC issue, the Irish Court noted that a US ombudsperson position created under Privacy Shield to handle EU citizens complaints about companies\u2019 handling of their data is not enough to overcome what it described as \u201cwell founded concerns\u201d raised by the DPC regarding the adequacy of the protections for EU citizens data.\n(Although, in a further irony, a permanent ombudsperson has yet to be appointed by the Trump administration.)\nKey conclusion from Irish High Court judgment referring to #CJEU @DPCIreland Facebook Schrems case on validity of #SCCs #EUDataP pic.twitter.com/LBGoQlHPRu\n\u2014 DPC Ireland (@DPCIreland) October 3, 2017\nThe exact questions that will to be referred by the court to the CJEU will be decided at a later date this month.\nMaking a video statement outside court in Dublin today, Schrems said the Irish court had dismissed Facebook\u2019s argument that the US government does not undertake any surveillance.\nFirst quick statement on High Court ruling.. #CJEU #SCCs @Snowden #Facebook #Referral #Dublin #HighCourt pic.twitter.com/hXQx1lBmx6\n\u2014 Max Schrems (@maxschrems) October 3, 2017\nIn a written statement on the ruling Schrems added: \u201cI welcome the judgement by the Irish High Court. It is important that a neutral Court outside of the US has summarized the facts on US surveillance in a judgement, after diving through more than 45,000 pages of documents in a five week hearing.\n\u201cI am of the view the Standard Contractual Clauses are perfectly valid, as they would allow the DPC to do its job and suspend individual problematic data flows, such as Facebook\u2019s. It is still unclear to me why the DPC is taking the extreme position that the SCCs should be invalidated Facebook across the board, when a targeted solution is available. The only explanation that I have is that they want to shift the responsibility back to Luxembourg instead of deciding themselves.\u201d\nOn Facebook, he also said: \u201cIn simple terms, US law requires Facebook to help the NSA with mass surveillance and EU law prohibits just that. As Facebook is subject to both jurisdictions, they got themselves in a legal dilemma that they cannot possibly solve in the long run.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Facebook for comment and will include the company\u2019s response when we have it. Update: A company spokesperson has now provided the following statement via email:\nStandard Contract Clauses provide critical safeguards to ensure that Europeans\u2019 data is protected once transferred to companies that operate in the US or elsewhere around the globe, and are used by thousands of companies to do business. They are essential to companies of all sizes, and upholding them is critical to ensuring the economy can continue to grow without disruption.\nThis ruling will have no immediate impact on the people or businesses who use our services. However it is essential that the [ECJ] now considers the extensive evidence demonstrating the robust protections in place under Standard Contractual Clauses and US law, before it makes any decision that may endanger the transfer of data across the Atlantic and around the globe.\nWhile Schrems\u2019 original complaint pertained to Facebook, the Irish DPC\u2019s position means many more companies that use the mechanism could face disruption if SCCs are ultimately invalidated as a result of the legal challenge to their validity.\nResponding to today\u2019s ruling, the BSA \u2014 one of the amicus curiae in the case speaking up for the importance of SCCs as \u201ca basis for data transfers that are essential to the economy and job creation on both sides of the Atlantic\u201d \u2014 said in a statement: \u201cWe have argued that this case should not be about standard contractual clauses in their entirety, but instead about how the clauses were formulated and used for the specific transfers involved here. We also explained that the SCCs include important safeguards to protect users \u2014 among them, they grant national data protection authorities the power to review specific implementation of these clauses on a case by case basis. We will continue to advocate these perspectives before the Court of Justice of the EU.\u201d\nEurope\u2019s influential Article 29 Working Party, which is made up of representatives from all the data protection authorities of the Member States, has previously voiced concerns about SCCs . It also has ongoing concerns about Privacy Shield .\nThe latter mechanism underwent its first annual review by EU officials in the US last month \u2014 and a report is due this month. Although the EC, which drove the process to replace the defunct Safe Harbor, was quick to profess itself publicly satisfied with what it has seen.\n\u26a1\ufe0f \u201cOfficial Visit to Washington D.C and San Francisco\u201d https://t.co/82LqHEYUbw\n\u2014 V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 (@VeraJourova) September 22, 2017\nFeatured Image: Twin Design / Shutterstock 0\nSHARES Advertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nura", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "schrems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snowden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014 max schrems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max schrems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "irish high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cjeu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irish court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "working party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european court of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dpc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european hq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "standard contractual contracts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ec", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luxembourg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "safe harbor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dpc ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:49:22.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c45ebaba998971639a5e1294c9fdd0cf74ac09c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.nLbB5GKW9DeXJfTV03sqzpWnKp6KFl10idU7WNfAno7A2W1eeqArI.GRHvS6UODMJYjw9oZJ4amlWS7tvhk6GvD5EAacNdz42L4olIBrAhY.JwAbUxuwaW", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TechCrunch", "title": "Intel introduces IoT provisioning solution to help install devices automatically", "title_full": "Intel introduces IoT provisioning solution to help install devices automatically", "published": "2017-10-03T15:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/gettyimages-730143533.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 145, "comments": 0, "shares": 145}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 327}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c45ebaba998971639a5e1294c9fdd0cf74ac09c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.nLbB5GKW9DeXJfTV03sqzpWnKp6KFl10idU7WNfAno7A2W1eeqArI.GRHvS6UODMJYjw9oZJ4amlWS7tvhk6GvD5EAacNdz42L4olIBrAhY.JwAbUxuwaW", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ron Miller", "published": "2017-10-03T15:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Intel introduces IoT provisioning solution to help install devices automatically", "text": "Intel introduces IoT provisioning solution to help install devices automatically Posted Challenge to data transfer tool used by Facebook will go to Europe\u2019s top court Chipmaker Intel wants a piece of the growing Internet of Things market and they have developed the Intel Secure Device solution to help companies provision IoT devices in a secure and automated way. \nDipti Vachani, vice president and general manager for the Internet of Things Group at Intel, says we hear that 50 billion IoT devices will be deployed by 2020, but there is a gap between that prediction and the reality her company is seeing. \n\u201cWe are not seeing customers deploying. We are seeing rock-star proofs of concept, but can they get into the factory and deploy those things [at scale],\u201d she asked. \nThe company has developed a free software development kit to help the industry solve a huge problem around provisioning IoT devices. If a firm is installing hundreds of smart bulbs, all of which communicate over WiFi, how do you do it in a secure way? The SDK gives companies a way to provision automatically and ensure that whatever the device \u2014 a smart light bulb, a sensor on a piece of equipment or a video camera \u2014 is a sanctioned device and can be installed securely automatically without human intervention. \nThis is particularly important when you are talking about IoT scale. This is a process that can benefit from automation because humans simply can\u2019t keep up. When hundreds of devices are being deployed, it could take months or years to do it manually. A machine can do it in hours or days. \nTo make this work, Intel needs to work with the entire ecosystem, starting with the IoT device manufacturers to buy into this system. If they are Intel Secure Device solution-aware through the SDK, the next step is the silicon level of machines that are provisioning these devices. Finally it requires the IoT platform vendors to also buy in, so that the provisioning can take place on their systems. \nAn employee installs the Intel-aware device, which communicates to a server, which is part of an IOT platform. All of the parties understand this is a sanctioned device because the SDK has connected them all together and the provisioning process takes place automatically behind the scenes with little or no human touch required. \nThis will require Intel winning over the industry to implement, of course, but it already boasts and impressive set of partners on all three parts of the system. Intel IoT Secure Device Ecosystem partners.

We are talking about lots of players coming together and that\u2019s the challenge in IoT. It\u2019s hard to do [something like this] with a lot of companies, and it\u2019s something we are able to do at Intel,\u201d she said.

In many ways, it\u2019s the logical next step for these technologies. \nFission itself is Platform9\u2019s open source serverless computing platform that runs on top of the Kubernetes container orchestration service. In its early days, serverless applications were mostly about building small functions that were triggered whenever a specific event like a file upload happened. The idea behind Fission Workflows is to help developers build more complex serverless applications. \nWhat Workflows does is help you orchestrate your serverless functions. The more complex your serverless applications, the more functions they typically use and the harder it gets to manage and update those interdependent functions. This also makes it difficult to monitor and troubleshoot these applications. \nSoam Vasani, a software engineer at Platform9 and Fission author, told me the idea of Fission was born out of a desire to make it easier for developers to use Kubernetes. \u201cBefore fission, our customers would often take weeks to get their heads around Kubernetes,\u201d he told me. Now, it only takes them an hour or so to get their first Fission functions to run. Fission Workflow then tackles the next problem: what happens when your serverless application grows from a simple function to a full-fledged application. \nBecause it runs on top of Kubernetes, Fission Workflows can run on virtually any cloud and in any private data center (or even locally, on a developer\u2019s laptop). Developers can write their applications in Python, NodeJs, Go, C# and PHP. \nWhat Fission Workflows is not, though, is a drag-and-drop interface like Microsoft Flow. For now, developers have to write their workflows by hand, though as Platform9 CEO and co-founder Sirish Raghuram tells me, the plan is to eventually launch a visual editor for Workflows, too. For now, Platform9 does offer a tool for visualizing these Workflows, though. \nLike Fission itself, Workflows will be fully open source. As Raghuram told me, the company\u2019s overall business plan is to charge its customers for delivering open source frameworks as a service. It\u2019s already doing that with Kubernetes and OpenStack and once Fission catches on, it\u2019ll most likely also add that to its portfolio. The software itself, though, will always remain open source and the company has no interest in moving to an open core or freemium model.

It\u2019s amazing how quickly Switch has managed to build a library that seems laser focused on hits, all across the board. 0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eric barone", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nintendo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stardew   posted intel", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": [{"name": "stardew valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:02:24.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7d2b13f65c9bd74275ea310370d759d10cb02ea6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kNoDrrjkZJbuZKNQ1E8QxR2JcwGv9a_rGStaWxKp._.H9GQcv0pRKBJQSl6g.kWypP_nrc.F_IKWOuN19sC_X5", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feedproxy.google.com/TechCrunch", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TechCrunch", "title": "HYPR raises $8 million to prevent another Equifax hack", "title_full": "HYPR raises $8 million to prevent another Equifax hack", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/biometric_original.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 369, "comments": 0, "shares": 369}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 188}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7d2b13f65c9bd74275ea310370d759d10cb02ea6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kNoDrrjkZJbuZKNQ1E8QxR2JcwGv9a_rGStaWxKp._.H9GQcv0pRKBJQSl6g.kWypP_nrc.F_IKWOuN19sC_X5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Katie Roof", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "HYPR raises $8 million to prevent another Equifax hack", "text": "HYPR raises $8 million to prevent another Equifax hack Posted Frame.io picks up $20 million to be the Slack of video The recent Equifax hack is yet another reminder that major corporations are still leaving themselves susceptible to attacks. \nThere are countless cybersecurity startups looking to fix this problem, but HYPR believes its decentralization approach is key. Its authentication technology secures traditional passwords and also biometrics like fingerprints, faces and voices. \nThe New York-based startup is announcing that it raised an $8 million Series A funding round led by RRE Ventures.

He says a lot of its 25 million users work at financial institutions. HYPR plans to integrate its technology into smart homes, ATMs and connected cars. \n\u201cEquifax is a perfect example of what happens when you centralize a lot of sensitive data,\u201d said Avetisov. HYPR ensures that its users\u2019 personal credentials always remain in their possession and that nothing is sent to any third parties.

The company solved a growing problem with a seemingly obvious solution.\nPeople who make video have a really hard time collaborating.\nTake, for instance, a brand that is making a TV commercial. The brand relays their vision to an advertising team, who builds out a story board, and then hands off the project to a production company. After the initial draft is edited, that video goes back to the advertising agency to get initial notes and feedback. After a second or third round of edits, that video goes to the brand for their thoughts.\nThroughout the entire process, dozens of people are weighing in on the video. And yet, most of that communication is relaying timestamps and trying to describe your own feedback on a moving piece of content.\nFrame.io lets all the people involved in the video creation, from the editors to the producers, directors, and external collaborators comment on and mark up this video, which is quickly shareable via a web link.\nFounder and CEO Emery Wells says that the long-term goal is to become the Slack of video. The company now has 370,000 users who have signed up, and has grown the team to 40 people, with $32 million in total funding. In fact, Frame.io sees more than 700,000 videos uploaded each month for review.\nWells focus with Frame.io has always been professional freelance video makers, people he says that are in the \u201cbusiness of film\u201d. Moving forward, Frame.io wants to double down on these customers, developing their security tools to the point where big studios and content producers feel comfortable sharing rough cuts of popular shows and movies on their platform.\nFrame.io also has an iPhone app, which won an Apple Design Award back in 2016. Wells says it\u2019s used on a regular basis, not by editors or videographers to upload videos but rather by producers and directors to give feedback on the go.\nIn the past year, Frame.io has released a fully enterprise product that is meant for larger teams. Wells says that 70 percent of the business comes from the self-serve product, but the rest is comprised of bigger clients, including Turner Broadcasting, Vice, Spotify, Buzzfeed and Funny or Die.\nThe enterprise product puts a huge focus on security and identity-based access, as well as the ability for an admin to create various groups or sub-teams that are customizable based on the project and the people involved. The enterprise product costs $25/seat, with options for more expensive storage deals if needed.\nThe funding will go towards further investment in security across the board, continued development of the product, and filling out a sales and marketing team.\n0\nSHARES Advertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emery wells", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wells", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "turner broadcasting", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shasta ventures", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accel partners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "firstmark capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "signalfire", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "spotify", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:09:10.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81c3fef0a57f07ecc4e90dff4b91233eb1020354", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kil1eXrJ3xnMHZjHwO8h6F", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TechCrunch", "title": "MessageBird, a European cloud comms platform that competes with Twilio, raises $60M Series A", "title_full": "MessageBird, a European cloud comms platform that competes with Twilio, raises $60M Series A", "published": "2017-10-03T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/hr_mks7567v3web.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1261, "comments": 0, "shares": 1261}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 628}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81c3fef0a57f07ecc4e90dff4b91233eb1020354", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kil1eXrJ3xnMHZjHwO8h6F", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Steve O'Hear", "published": "2017-10-03T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "MessageBird, a European cloud comms platform that competes with Twilio, raises $60M Series A", "text": "MessageBird, a European cloud comms platform that competes with Twilio, raises $60M Series A Posted HYPR raises $8 million to prevent another Equifax hack MessageBird , a cloud communications platform that counts publicly listed Twilio as a competitor, has raised a hefty $60 million in Series A funding. The round is being led by Accel in the U.S., with Atomico, the VC firm founded by Skype\u2019s Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, leading in Europe. \nNotably, I\u2019m told this is the largest Series A for a graduate of Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator, and in quintessential European enterprise startup fashion, Amsterdam-founded MessageBird is already profitable. Aside from YC investment , the startup has been bootstrapped till now, too, and is on track to hit a $100 million run rate this year. Keeping up? I do hope so \u2014 all of which begs the question of why the company has raised funding now and why such a large round. \nIn a call, MessageBird founder and CEO Robert Vis told me that, even though the startup has \u201cbeen profitable from day one,\u201d the level of in-bound enquiries it had started to get not only validated demand but was also at a level that the then 40-person team could no longer service. To grow and scale appropriately, a cash injection was needed, although he stressed that more than money he wanted to choose VCs that could genuinely add value. This included telecoms expertise, with Vis saying that Accel and Atomico in particular met that criteria. \n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those situations where we wanted to raise money to grow our teams but I didn\u2019t want to just take money from everywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cVC money in that sense is sort of like a commodity, there is enough of it out there if you build something that people are interested in. But I think it\u2019s really important to find partners that are a really good fit and that are going to fit with your culture\u201d. \nAnother interesting aspect of MessageBird is that it has historically targeted larger enterprise customers and, says Vis, built more direct relationships and connections to carriers so that it can compete on price, reliability and security. \nOn the surface, MessageBird has a product similar to other cloud communications platforms \u2014 ie it offers various voice, video and text capabilities all wrapped up in a API \u2014 but Vis says that because the company has its own telecoms infrastructure and direct integrations with 220 carriers globally, it is much closer to the end point, having to make far less hops so to speak, which can otherwise introduce delays or messages never arriving at all. This, he says, is critical for the enterprise, such as, for example, a bank\u2019s app sending you an SMS alert for you to confirm that a purchase isn\u2019t fraudulent. \nDirect carrier integrations also means that, unlike other cloud communications platforms, MessageBird doesn\u2019t need to go through additional third-parties, which reduces cost. I understand that one competing cloud communications platform used to be a customer of MessageBird itself in order to offer wider coverage, though Vis declined to confirm if that was indeed Twilio. \nAll of which brings us to MessageBird\u2019s 15,000 international customers, which along with the likes of DoorDash, SAP, Huawei, ING, Amber Alert, and Heineken, includes Uber. If you have been following the cloud communications space closely, you\u2019ll know that Twilio also counts Uber as a customer but in May issued guidance that revenue would fall because the ride booking app was planning to diversify its cloud comms provision , including moving away from Twilio as its principal communications infrastructure provider. It now looks as if MessageBird has picked up some, if not all, of that slack. \nVis said he couldn\u2019t comment on Uber specifically, but says there are a number of reasons why a very large communications app, which Uber is, would look to use a range of cloud communications platforms once it reached a certain scale, not least to bring down cost and introduce competition as part of any sourcing and procurement strategy. \u201cI think we get chosen because we are a really secure, fast and cost effective solution for them,\u201d he says. 0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "messagebird", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert vis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twilio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niklas zennstr\u00f6m", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hypr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skype", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heineken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "messagebird", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twilio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "atomico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:03:54.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2922e1d8865360494c4cfa9277725fc297b4edab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kxvP2JsfjJ.iSI9.PtV2ykXRFGTj0clopjNx3fRrXXIPSCaAQGpUiYEQ3OtsIUZiePcz_1KgRd2252v7EoZ_kTDuKm1v7MIl8-", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feedproxy.google.com/TechCrunch", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TechCrunch", "title": "Kahoot launches premium version aimed at corporate training market", "title_full": "Kahoot launches premium version aimed at corporate training market", "published": "2017-10-03T17:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/kahoot-screen.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 72, "comments": 1, "shares": 72}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 86}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2922e1d8865360494c4cfa9277725fc297b4edab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kxvP2JsfjJ.iSI9.PtV2ykXRFGTj0clopjNx3fRrXXIPSCaAQGpUiYEQ3OtsIUZiePcz_1KgRd2252v7EoZ_kTDuKm1v7MIl8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mike Butcher", "published": "2017-10-03T17:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kahoot launches premium version aimed at corporate training market", "text": "Few people thought that a simple site which allowed teachers to create quizzes for their classes online would get this far, but Kahoot has been a smash hit since it launched.

That\u2019s a lofty goal, considering the discovery for just one drug can traditionally take decades and tens of millions of dollars, with a high rate of failure before anything comes of the research.\nHowever, the startup uses machine learning to process and rapidly discover new drug treatments for diseases in a fraction of the time and cost.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is turning biology into a data science problem,\u201d Gibson tells TechCrunch.\nThat\u2019s something Silicon Valley investors are getting behind as more venture funds have started to pour money into biotech startups over the past few years.\nRecursion\u2019s approach is similar to Y Combinator\u2019s Notable Labs in that it uses imaging of cells combined with machine learning to identify which drugs will work best without waiting years to go through trial and error. However, Notable focuses on just one particular kind of disease \u2014 cancer. Recursion takes a broader approach, sifting through possible chemical combinations for an average of eight diseases a week, according to co-founder Chris Gibson.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the inverse of what the industry typically does,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cThey spend a lot of time upfront trying to understand the disease and then two to three years down the road they look to see if they have a compound that might work. Sometimes they do and sometimes they don\u2019t.\u201d\nHowever, Recursion spends very little time focusing on the disease at the beginning. Instead, it uses that image-based approach to look at promising compounds.\nOf course, identifying possible compounds is just the first part. Recursion will still need to take those drugs through clinical trial.\nIt\u2019s also in a crowded industry with a lot of competition from bigger drug makers. But, Gibson points out, Recursion owns all the data it uses and there are thousands of diseases still out there without a treatment so the opportunity is wide.\nBut even with lots of good data, machine learning technology and a big field, biotech still takes much more capital to get it off the ground. Of course, discovering a new drug can be very lucrative and margins in the pharmaceuticals industry continue to soar.\nLux Capital, which led Recursions Series A round, jumped in again for this round, along with previous participants Obvious Ventures, Advantage Capital, Felicis, Epic, and AME. New investors include Mubadala, Menlo Ventures, CRV, Two Sigma and various angel investors.\nRecursion had previously raised $20 million, bringing the total in the coffers up to $80 million.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tesla", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chris gibson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gibson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recursion", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "menlo ventures", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obvious ventures", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "advantage capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lux capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recursion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mubadala", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "salt lake city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:07:20.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50fc7d1dcc0aba37d3315925875c536871faeb88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kh8lZu1Fkypt.N3cYmSTpg4OYDl7s4oMsWFQLC7D8KoRmrkC7oW8wMotJwts_hQ3JRngiMm5I0E8laU7OpNn.s2R5r73Dv6v7ZZChPwXWfKg--", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "https://www.specificfeeds.com/techcrunch2?subParam=followPubFilter", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Techcrunch News", "title": "Google launches Cloud Firestore, a new document database for app developers", "title_full": "Google launches Cloud Firestore, a new document database for app developers", "published": "2017-10-03T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/firestore-fabric-newsletter.png", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1352, "comments": 1, "shares": 1352}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 419}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "50fc7d1dcc0aba37d3315925875c536871faeb88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kh8lZu1Fkypt.N3cYmSTpg4OYDl7s4oMsWFQLC7D8KoRmrkC7oW8wMotJwts_hQ3JRngiMm5I0E8laU7OpNn.s2R5r73Dv6v7ZZChPwXWfKg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google launches Cloud Firestore, a new document database for app developers", "text": "Google launches Cloud Firestore, a new document database for app developers Posted Who are you? Google Cloud releases custom identity roles Beta Google today launched a new database service for Firebase , its platform for app developers. The new Firestore database complements the existing Firebase Realtime Database and indeed, there\u2019s quite a bit of overlap between these two services. \nAs Firebase co-founder James Tamplin told me, the Realtime Database (RTDB) was always the flagship product of the platform. The service is now in use by hundreds of thousands of developers. Tamplin argues that these developers love the service because it offers them access to a real-time database that is managed and scaled for them by Google. \nHe also admitted that as the team scaled and grew the service, it hit upon some developer pain points that the new Cloud Firestore is meant to overcome: RTDB makes it difficult to deal with really complex queries and, because of the way the platform was architected, some of Firebase\u2019s largest customers often hit the service\u2019s hard limit of 100,000 concurrently connected devices and had to split their databases across shards, negating some of the advantages of using RTDB in the first place. \nGiven how hard it would have been to completely re-build the existing database service to fulfill these new requirements, the team chose to simply built a new one. Firestore was designed from the ground up to support a number of use cases like making it easier for developers to build offline apps with the help of a local database for web, iOS and Android and to easily sync data between different apps and users in real time. \nAll of the data is automatically replicated across multiple regions and with strong consistency. Like its predecessor, Firestore can scale automatically. \nThe team also notes that its client-side SDK can handle an app\u2019s authentication and networking code while the backend offers a number of security rules to control access to the data and apply validation logic to it, too. Thanks to these features, you can connect your app directly to the database without using an intermediary server that would otherwise handle these validation steps. \nUnsurprisingly, all of this is deeply integrated with the rest of the Firebase platform, including Google\u2019s Cloud Functions serverless platforms. 0 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james tamplin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tamplin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sdk", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:51:44.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aaba45b8777e7b05711a66f7b9922fe46a75a7b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kx1JHPprATiECJyAf_ICLKYkYCjGmDM37_38SaRzkn6UUwqpbgQr9lRh5YGyhWYngFkzZhb5fGIcHTXZpIlvcqHKoiI4BFLQE4hkUqXYa0sMNMwTVBbkfP", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "https://www.specificfeeds.com/techcrunch2?subParam=followPubFilter", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Techcrunch News", "title": "Missouri forms public-private partnership to advance Hyperloop One route", "title_full": "Missouri forms public-private partnership to advance Hyperloop One route", "published": "2017-10-03T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/hyperloop-one.jpg", "performance_score": 7, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 701, "comments": 2, "shares": 701}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 307}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aaba45b8777e7b05711a66f7b9922fe46a75a7b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kx1JHPprATiECJyAf_ICLKYkYCjGmDM37_38SaRzkn6UUwqpbgQr9lRh5YGyhWYngFkzZhb5fGIcHTXZpIlvcqHKoiI4BFLQE4hkUqXYa0sMNMwTVBbkfP", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Missouri forms public-private partnership to advance Hyperloop One route", "text": "Missouri forms public-private partnership to advance Hyperloop One route Posted Google launches Cloud Firestore, a new document database for app developers One of the projects seeking to prove that they have a viable route for building one of Hyperloop One\u2019s very first actual hyperloop routes has formed a formal public-private partnership to help keep the project moving forward.

They warn that when you create a custom role, you\u2019ll need a system for tracking them because GCP is always updating the platform and you need to be sure your custom permissions are in line with the latest versions.\nWhile Google has done a good job of providing a range of permissions for the most common kinds of use cases, there are always going to be outliers and giving admins the ability to manage a set of custom roles is going to be appealing to organizations who need even greater granular control than they get out of the box.\nFeatured Image: Laurence Dutton/Getty Images 0\nSHARES Advertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "khare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohit khare", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google cloud", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "softbank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gcp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:51:44.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb8185c7c19b17295e8acc7d911de83c7b1c60fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kOPJNpPmlzxuAAxJ4Yiv5hxOwHgLeoVDFNgIcLicWPpQ--", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "https://www.specificfeeds.com/techcrunch2?subParam=followPubFilter", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Techcrunch News", "title": "What SoftBank really wants", "title_full": "What SoftBank really wants", "published": "2017-10-03T18:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-819235404.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 268, "comments": 2, "shares": 268}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 993}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cb8185c7c19b17295e8acc7d911de83c7b1c60fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kOPJNpPmlzxuAAxJ4Yiv5hxOwHgLeoVDFNgIcLicWPpQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T18:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "What SoftBank really wants", "text": "Drug discovery startup Recursion raises $60 million in Series B from Data Collective Some in Silicon Valley aren\u2019t quite sure what to make of SoftBank and its massive, roughly $100 billion Vision Fund. At times, they say privately, it looks like a drunken gunslinger, firing off massive checks in quick succession. But sources close to SoftBank say there is a method to its madness. In fact, these same sources say SoftBank\u2019s investors believe they\u2019ll see at least a 20 percent internal rate of return (IRR) over time from Vision Fund as it funds whole sectors being disrupted by artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 from pharma, to utilities, to ridesharing \u2014 and whose data SoftBank can leverage into an endless stream of opportunities. \nThe idea, these people say, is not to produce venture-like returns. The idea is instead to return more money to investors than private equity firms like KKR, whose first 18 private equity funds wound up delivering more than two times total capital invested on a gross basis, and produced a net IRR of 18.9 percent. Says one source close to SoftBank, \u201cIf someone is investing in [Vision Fund], he\u2019s expecting to get better returns than with KKR and Blackstone.\u201d \nIndeed, 20 percent IRR over seven years \u2014 the time SoftBank estimates it will take most of Vision Fund\u2019s bets to play out \u2014 is the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d says one source. \u201cBest case,\u201d adds this person, is \u201cinvestors get close to what Masa has done in the past.\u201d \nIt\u2019s a reference to the 44 percent IRR on investments that SoftBank can boast over its 18-year history, though more than one critic has noted that much of this number is rooted in SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son\u2019s early bet on Alibaba, beginning in 2000. Son would eventually pour $58 million into the company; those holdings, which SoftBank maintains, save for a $10 billion chunk it sold to finance another purchase , are currently worth $130 billion. Higher and higher \nDoing back-of-the-napkin math on this 20 percent IRR \u2014 whether over seven years or a more traditional 10-year time frame \u2014 would translate into between $130 billion and $430 billion for SoftBank\u2019s investors \u2014 minus its initial investments, management fees and the debt that makes up roughly $44 billion of Vision Fund\u2019s total holdings. \nThat\u2019s a whole lot of capital to generate for limited partners, so how does it do it? SoftBank thinks it can get there largely through ridesharing, say sources familiar with its thinking. More specifically, SoftBank is counting on the smooth evolution of today\u2019s rideshare companies into vast networks of self-driving taxis . \nIt has already made an array of bets that underscore this theme, including on the China-based ride-hail giant Didi Chuxing ; in Grab , the dominant ride-hail startup in Southeast Asia; and in Ola, India\u2019s leading ride-hailing company, which reportedly closed on $2 billion just yesterday, including from SoftBank. \nHelping grow a U.S. player is also crucial to its strategy, and SoftBank has been openly unsentimental about whether that means funding Uber or Lyft, though Uber would seem to be its strong preference. Says one source close of a meeting that\u2019s slated to take place today, wherein Uber\u2019s directors will vote on whether to go forward with a $10 billion stock sale to SoftBank: \u201cUber should be scared of SoftBank funding Lyft. They better take [the money].\u201d \nWe\u2019ll see soon enough how scared or not Uber may be of scorning SoftBank. Certainly, though, concern about the companies that SoftBank doesn\u2019t fund is growing in Silicon Valley. \nAsked onstage earlier this month about SoftBank\u2019s impact on Silicon Valley, venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson of DFJ called SoftBank a \u201ckingmaker of sorts that\u2019s giving a massive infusion to some companies and not others. \n\u201cIn the long run,\u201d Jurvetson said, \u201cthat\u2019s just noise. The better product and service should win. In the short run,\u201d he continued, \u201cit could [create] some interesting shifts in the outcomes of companies that would otherwise be in a normal horse race.\u201d \nAnother source who invested recently in the two-year-old, indoor farming company Bowery Farming , said he was taken aback when SoftBank led a $200 million investment in a competitor, Plenty , just one month after Bowery closed its latest round . Bowery has raised $31 million from VCs. \u201cIt definitely gives you pause,\u201d says this investor. Down to the wire \nStill, even as SoftBank barrels forward \u2014 Vision Fund has so far deployed $20 billion, including investments in U.S. chipmaker Nvidia and the co-working juggernaut WeWork \u2014 questions over its pacing and strategy remain. \nLast week, at a small event hosted by this editor in San Francisco, venture capitalist Megan Quinn of Spark Capital acknowledged that there have been times when a company is talking with firms like hers about a sub-$100 million round, and SoftBank has entered the picture \u201cand is like, here\u2019s $200 million!\u201d \nQuinn likened the deals to \u201cbaby buyouts,\u201d saying that SoftBank is buying more of its portfolio companies than do traditional investors, sometimes because \u201cSoftBank has been able to convince them that something that looks like a baby buyout is actually the right round for them.\u201d \nOther times, she added, \u201cthe company [that\u2019s fundraising] has not been able to raise from traditional Series C investors, so they\u2019re looking for something more meaningful \u2014 someone with more ownership opportunity.\u201d \nAsked about these comments, one source close to the Vision Fund tells us, \u201cIf you can show [SoftBank] where it can invest $10 million and make a billion, who is going to say no? But how many opportunities are out there like that? If you think about size of the fund and you think about what\u2019s going to move the needle, then it\u2019s fair to say [its team] has to invest a few hundred million in something. Otherwise, it\u2019s not worthwhile.\u201d \nSome say that no matter what SoftBank\u2019s aim \u2014 whether to produce venture- or instead private-equity-like returns \u2014 pouring so much money into tech over a relatively short period is a strategy that\u2019s difficult to grasp. \nSpeaking alongside Quinn at the same gathering, investor Jules Maltz of Institutional Venture Partners meanwhile questioned SoftBank\u2019s math, saying it \u201chas some challenges. \n\u201cIf you think about trying to return $100 billion, you don\u2019t just want to get the money back; you want to make a return on that,\u201d said Maltz. \u201cSo you probably want $200 billion, meaning you want to double your money, which is good.\u201d \nStill, said Maltz, \u201cafter fees and all that, SoftBank\u2019s investors [get less than $100 billion in profit]. When you then think that [SoftBank\u2019s] average ownership [stake] is between 15 and 20 percent, and you think about how much liquidity they have to generate in terms of the companies sold in that fund just for them to hit the relatively modest returns of doubling the fund, you start realizing they need more than $1 trillion of market cap in their companies.\u201d \nThat\u2019s possible if \u201cthey get the next Alibaba, the next Facebook,\u201d said Maltz. \u201cAnd I think that must be what they are going for . . . but . . . I don\u2019t think they can do it.\u201d Out of the fire \nVC Jeff Bussgang of Flybridge Capital Partners seems to suggest it doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 that given how fast the money is being put to work, investors should expect that SoftBank will be raising another $100 billion fund soon enough. \n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly inflationary when that much capital flows into the system,\u201d says Bussgang, who says SoftBank routinely pays twice the prices that even deep-pocketed mutual fund investors are willing to pay because it can. \nThanks to that 20 percent IRR that it\u2019s targeting, \u201c[Vision Fund] can pay what they\u2019re paying. They\u2019ve promised their LPs a lower return threshold, so they can underwrite to those lower returns while projecting much bigger outcomes.\u201d \nWhat \u201cpeople don\u2019t appreciate,\u201d adds Bussgang, is that this is just the beginning. \u201cSon is providing a way for sovereign wealth funds to invest $2 billion at a time into an asset class they can\u2019t otherwise access,\u201d he says. \n\u201cIf they want to invest through a Spark or an IVP, the most [of their capital that they can invest through the funds] is, say, $50 million. Vision Fund meanwhile [accommodates] a flow of capital that hasn\u2019t had a way of accessing this highly fragmented market.\u201d \nUnsurprisingly, those close to SoftBank\u2019s thinking say that the fund is simply misunderstood. \nAsked, for example, about the giant checks that Vision Fund is writing, and whether these could limit the upside for its portfolio companies\u2019 employees, limit the companies\u2019 exit options or promote the kind of reckless spending that has killed many a promising company, these loyalists argue that SoftBank is anything but careless in its check writing, noting that SoftBank typically demands board seats and certain rights that protect its investments. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s overfunding companies,\u201d says one source. \u201cThe team is definitely holding companies\u2019 feet to the fire to ensure they allocate their resources the right way.\u201d \nIt\u2019s also not funding as many companies as the press would have people believe, says this same source, saying specifically of the self-driving car startup Zoox that SoftBank will \u201cnot fund it in this lifetime.\u201d (A report last month spawned many more reports that the company was in discussions with SoftBank for a round that could value the company at upwards of $4 billion.) \nZoox, which reportedly hired a group of 17 Apple auto engineers in late August, after Apple abandoned its own plans to build a vehicle, declined to comment for this story. Watch it go, bling! \nDespite the massive checks it\u2019s writing, SoftBank has already appeared somewhat fallible at times. \nLast week, for example, just one month after leading a $1.1 billion investment in a biopharma holding company called Roivant , a widely awaited drug candidate that would have been a blockbuster for one of Roivant\u2019s subsidiaries, Axovant, was deemed ineffective. \nAxovant\u2019s formerly high-flying shares tanked on the news; Roivant remains the company\u2019s biggest shareholder. \nIt was a crushing development for Roivant. Yet in what could serve as a reminder that it\u2019s too early to judge SoftBank\u2019s strategy, Roivant received more promising news yesterday, when a Phase 3 trial in which another of its subsidiaries is involved produced positive results . \nSays one source close to SoftBank, \u201cIf mistakes have been made so far, no one will know for another 18 months.\u201d \nThis person points to Nvidia, whose value has risen since SoftBank invested $4 billion into the publicly traded company in May, when the company\u2019s shares were trading at $137 apiece. (They now trade at $180.) \u201cWhatever is visible,\u201d he added, \u201chas made money.\u201d Featured Image: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images 0 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "didi chuxing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff bussgang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "masa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quinn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jurvetson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bussbang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "masayoshi son", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "megan quinn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maltz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zoox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tomohiro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jules maltz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roivant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve jurvetson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "softbank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ivp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vision fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dfj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blackstone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institutional venture partners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nvidia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kkr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flybridge capital partners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bowery farming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "silicon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:51:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5b0f7538191dec39869842e002b39f08a6f78064", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.milfla6ImkfpAn1ufN1T6yp5AijPILSqyQ6R38ExcqOXkK8PuKmx8ao9YcyjBXyIgfyQeYiriSUKDhEGZuua9B0DiHwwuwO8bCovwz4.w9fA--", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feedproxy.google.com/TechCrunch", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TechCrunch", "title": "GM\u2019s Cruise explains why self-driving tests in dense cities gives it an edge", "title_full": "GM\u2019s Cruise explains why self-driving tests in dense cities gives it an edge", "published": "2017-10-03T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cruise_broll_072817.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 256, "comments": 0, "shares": 256}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 33}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5b0f7538191dec39869842e002b39f08a6f78064", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.milfla6ImkfpAn1ufN1T6yp5AijPILSqyQ6R38ExcqOXkK8PuKmx8ao9YcyjBXyIgfyQeYiriSUKDhEGZuua9B0DiHwwuwO8bCovwz4.w9fA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Darrell Etherington", "published": "2017-10-03T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "GM\u2019s Cruise explains why self-driving tests in dense cities gives it an edge", "text": "GM\u2019s Cruise explains why self-driving tests in dense cities gives it an edge Posted Will Google Home finally break out of Amazon Echo\u2019s shadow? GM is sharing more info about its testing process for autonomous cars through Cruise, the startup it acquired last year. For the first time, Cruise has shared some numbers related to the advantages it says its program has by placing emphasis on city testing, vs. testing only in less densely occupied areas. \n\u201cCruise does the majority of its testing, or at least a significant portion of it, in San Francisco, and in particular the most dense part of San Francisco,\u201d explained Cruise CEO and founder Kyle Vogt on a call related to the news. \n\u201cThe big thing that we want to point out today, is that driving in San Francisco is almost nothing like driving in the suburbs or other places where self-driving cars are tested,\u201d Vogt explained. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about miles, but really miles are not created equally.\u201d \nVogt\u2019s reference to talk of \u201cmiles\u201d is almost certainly an indirect jibe at Alphabet\u2019s Waymo, which frequently reminds the public that it has the most miles of autonomous vehicle testing to its credit among companies working on the problem. Also, Vogt followed up quickly with another veiled reference to Waymo\u2019s testing program, which is running a trial ride hailing service in Arizona. \n\u201cIn more suburban areas like Scottsdale, which is a suburb of Phoenix, we actually have data so we can compare the two,\u201d Vogt said. Hey added that in the city (of SF specifically), tricky maneuvers like passing vehicles by crossing over into opposing lane of traffic actually happen quite frequently, as opposed to in suburbs. \nIn fact, this kind of thing happens 23.5 times as often in dense urban environments vs. sparsely populated suburbs. And it\u2019s the same when it comes to interacting with emergency vehicles, Vogt said, noting that Cruise\u2019s vehicles encounter and have to interact with emergency vehicles almost 47 times as often in San Francisco vs. in a test environment like Scottsdale. \n\u201cAs human drivers, we don\u2019t draw too much of a distinction between driving in a suburb and driving in a city,\u201d Vogt said, noting that actually they\u2019re very, very different. He added that the reason Cruise has this focus isn\u2019t arbitrary, but because it wants to test in the most challenging conditions in order to accelerate the deployment of actual AVs on roads. \nVogt says the complexity of running autonomous vehicles on roads is actually exponentially harder in urban cases, because the more objects you see, the more complex interaction between those objects have to be considered. In a simple environment, he noted, generally a vehicle is only doing one thing at a time. In dense conditions like San Francisco, all of these are stacked up on top of each other \u2013 like making a lane change while in presence of an emergency vehicle. \nIn response to a question about whether this announcement was a direct shot at Waymo, which has deployed a test pilot as mentioned above in a suburban area in Phoenix, Vogt said that \u201cI\u2019m saying there\u2019s almost no comparison between driving in a suburban environment and in an urban one.\u201d \nCruise\u2019s testing is broadly split about equally in terms of the divide between suburban and city environments, per Vogt. He also provided a brief update on the progress of the company\u2019s San Francisco based ride-hailing service pilot for employees. \n\u201cIt\u2019s given us some valuable feedback on what\u2019s important from the customer standpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to make some tweaks to our software to improve the experience.\u201d 0 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cruise", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "waymo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vogt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyle vogt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gm", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alphabet", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waymo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scottsdale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:13:26.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44eb5d783c7057e0043df59b800a133ce209f8c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kkITvtzD0fHILmYubBeNJpWp7J7o7ePyWdhWvM3Ac.IS7v7PjWCSsUuNlIO4et7bxqcazBE5LnvizsDJit94A1", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feedproxy.google.com/TechCrunch", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TechCrunch", "title": "Will Google Home finally break out of Amazon Echo\u2019s shadow?", "title_full": "Will Google Home finally break out of Amazon Echo\u2019s shadow?", "published": "2017-10-03T19:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/amazon-echo-google-home.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 223, "comments": 5, "shares": 223}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 34}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "44eb5d783c7057e0043df59b800a133ce209f8c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kkITvtzD0fHILmYubBeNJpWp7J7o7ePyWdhWvM3Ac.IS7v7PjWCSsUuNlIO4et7bxqcazBE5LnvizsDJit94A1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brian Heater", "published": "2017-10-03T19:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will Google Home finally break out of Amazon Echo\u2019s shadow?", "text": "Will Google Home finally break out of Amazon Echo\u2019s shadow? Posted Smart mattress startup Eight shows off its Alexa integration Last week, Amazon went on the offensive. It was a sort an Operation Shock and Awe of Echos, bringing the total line up to six devices \u2014 seven, if you count the Tap (which Amazon kind of, sort of does). The Seattle event was an aggressive show of dominance from a company that has essentially controlled the home assistant space since the release of the first device in late 2014. For the past year or so, most analysts have had Amazon\u2019s smart speaker marketshare hovering between 75 and 80 percent , a rare command for the consumer electronics space. Tomorrow\u2019s Google event in San Francisco is a chance for the search giant to strike back. Along with two new Pixel phones, the event is expected to focus on Google Home \u2014 after all, it\u2019s been nearly a year since the company\u2019s answer to the Echo first hit the market. During that time, there\u2019s been little question that the company has been playing catch up to Amazon\u2019s two-year lead. And Google\u2019s done a pretty decent job on that front. I/O was a big show for Home, in spite of the fact that we didn\u2019t actually see any new hardware. Back in May, the company brought some significant upgrades to the ecosystem, including hands-free calling, proactive alerts (contextual updates you don\u2019t have to trigger manually) and a whole bunch of recipes. Even more compellingly, the company made a big push to get Assistant functionality onto more third-party devices. The fruits of that effort started to bear out at IFA in September, when companies like Sony and JBL announced premium speakers sporting the functionality \u2014 and soon after Bose announced that it was bringing Assistant to its latest headphones, the QC35 II. Amazon\u2019s been offering that sort of integration for some months now, but Google\u2019s aggressive push has made up a lot of ground. A cursory glimpse at tomorrow\u2019s rumored announcements shows a company that continues to be somewhat reactive toward industry moves. There\u2019s the mini version of the Home, set to compete with the Echo Dot, hitting a $50 or so price point, and a larger, more premium model in line with Apple\u2019s HomePod (and the new Echo). There\u2019s even a rumored version with a display in the works set to take on the Echo Show, which could go a ways toward explaining why the company pulled YouTube support from Amazon\u2019s device. All of the above have likely been in the works for a while \u2014 some before the announcements of their analogs. And each would go a ways toward bolstering Google\u2019s offerings \u2014 particularly the mini version, which has quickly skyrocketed to the top of Amazon\u2019s list of best selling Echos, owing to its ridiculously affordable price point. But in each case, Google isn\u2019t doing enough from on the hardware side to really start to make up ground. Of course, anyone in the industry will tell you that it\u2019s still very much early days for the smart home assistant. And just because Amazon has been dominant thus far doesn\u2019t mean the race is over. Google\u2019s building on top of a solid foundation. The company is a the king of contextual search, which should go a ways toward offering a fuller experience on Assistant, once it truly cracks the code on voice interfaces. The company also has a tremendous hardware base in the form of Android. Like Apple with Siri, mobile devices are a huge part of getting Assistant quite literally into the hands of more users. If the experience is a positive one, users will be much more inclined to adopt it for the home. Straddling the line between mobile and home is the one spot where Google really has the competition beat. HomePod is still a few months off and its $349 price tag will make it cost prohibitive for many mainstream users. It\u2019s also completely possible Apple won\u2019t allow for the same kind of third-party hardware use for Siri that Amazon and Google have opened up to \u2014 the company tends to be extremely protective of its user experiences. Amazon\u2019s mobile Alexa play, meanwhile, has been spotty at best with a few handset makers dipping their toes in the water. This is occurring, mind you, on devices that, for the most part, already have access to Google Assistant. Maybe tomorrow\u2019s event will have some kind of killer bullet. From the looks of the rumors, however, the company is still playing catch up to Amazon\u2019s utter dominance of the home market. Google is going to have to find a way to truly distinguish itself if it wants to change the narrative. For now, the race for the space is going to be a series of small advances. Thankfully for Google, however, it\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. 0 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google home", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "sony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "echos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tc team will google home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ifa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jbl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:13:29.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c22d8bf3fdc4a8b1c940d0d7116e3a74626b5596", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.nJby1UsCKbxG_LtGKQqWdU", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feedproxy.google.com/TechCrunch", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TechCrunch", "title": "Smart mattress startup Eight shows off its Alexa integration", "title_full": "Smart mattress startup Eight shows off its Alexa integration", "published": "2017-10-03T19:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eightbed.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 101, "comments": 0, "shares": 101}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 6}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c22d8bf3fdc4a8b1c940d0d7116e3a74626b5596", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.nJby1UsCKbxG_LtGKQqWdU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anthony Ha", "published": "2017-10-03T19:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Smart mattress startup Eight shows off its Alexa integration", "text": "Smart mattress startup Eight shows off its Alexa integration Posted Sleep tech startup Eight has always aimed to connect its products ( first a mattress cover , then an actual smart mattress ) to the broader smart home ecosystem. \nMost recently, it launched a new Alexa skill that allows Eight owners to use the Echo and other Amazon devices to interact with their mattress, both to control it (say by adjusting the temperature) and to access their sleep data. \nWe visited the Eight office in New York to see the Alexa integration in action, and to talk to co-founder and CEO Matteo Franceschetti about his vision for the company. \n\u201cYou don\u2019t even need to touch your phone \u2014 you can just ask Alexa how you slept,\u201d Franceschetti said. \u201cOr you can ask Alexa to start warming your bed and Alexa will do it automatically for you.\u201d \nYou can see more of our interview and brief demo in the video above.

Just weeks later, the company announced that it was keeping the lights on after help from a \u201cthird party.\u201d \nWe now know that third party to be Microsoft. \n\u201cMicrosoft is excited to incorporate communications technology into our mixed reality ecosystem.

Situations of people, places, and things have deeper meaning and in turn, are more memorable.\u201d \nTerms of the deal were not disclosed. AltspaceVR raised more than $15 million in venture funding from Comcast Ventures, GV, Formation 8 and others. \nAs of July, the startup detailed that it had just 35,000 monthly active users. Following the shutdown announcement, the startup let go a significant number of employees, leaving what it referred to as a \u201cskeleton crew\u201d to keep the service running. \nThe startup joins Microsoft as the company is aiming to distinguish its \u201cmixed reality\u201d platform for VR headsets running Windows 10.

Part of this update includes full support for Windows Mixed Reality , the company\u2019s name for the continuum between augmented reality and full virtual reality. After lining up support and headsets from partners like Acer, Dell HP and Lenovo, Microsoft also today announced that Samsung is bringing a virtual reality headset for room-scale VR to its platform.\nMicrosoft made this announcement at a small press event in San Francisco today.\nThe Samsung HMD Odyssey will feature full support for Microsoft\u2019s Mixed Reality Platform and feature two AMOLED displays, inside-out tracking, a built-in microphone (for Cortana support) and the usual Windows motions controllers. The displays will offer a 110-degree field of view, which is on par with the Oculus Rift. What does set the Odyssey apart, though, is its per-eye resolution of 1440\u00d71600 for the two 3.5\u2033 displays with a 90Hz refresh rate, which is significantly higher than that of rival headsets.\nOne other interesting feature here is that Samsung has partnered with the Austrian headphone and microphone manufacturer AKG to offer built-in headphones.\n\u201cWhen we began designing and engineering the Samsung HMD Odyssey with Microsoft, there was only one goal in mind, create a high performing headset that\u2019s easy to set up and can transport people to the incredible world of virtual reality,\u201d writes Samsung Electronics America VP and General Manager Alanna Cotton today. \u201cSamsung is committed to working across platforms to build cutting-edge technology, and we\u2019re excited to partner with Microsoft to shape the future of virtual reality.\u201d\nGiven its specs, this is clearly a premium headset \u2014 and quite likely the nicest one in the current mixed reality lineup. It\u2019ll sell at a premium price, too, though. The full set with headset and motion controllers will cost $499 and will ship November 6 , with pre-orders starting today. That\u2019s the same price as an Oculus Rift.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Samsung is going its own way here. Most of the other mixed reality headsets are going with Microsoft\u2019s reference specs and LCD screens, which don\u2019t refresh quite as fast as the AMOLED displays that Samsung is using here.

Apparently he can now chalk off a fourth. \nAt the time of writing Body Labs had not responded to requests for comment. \nThe company\u2019s social media accounts have been quiet since August, which may indicate the deal closed recently. \nUpdate: A note on Body Labs\u2019 website has now confirmed the acquisition, saying the startup \u201clook[s] forward to innovating on behalf of customers\u201d. Modeling the human body \nVideo demos on Body Labs\u2019 website show its tech being used to augment a human with digital content as the person moves around by cladding them in a full-body gaming avatar \u2018suit\u2019 or adding boxing gloves and bunny slippers to a dancing man. \nBody Labs also says its \u201cSOMA Shape API\u201d can be used to \u201caccurately predict and measure the 3D shape of your customers using just a single image\u201d, suggesting this can power \u201ccustom apparel\u201d or be used by fashion ecommerce retailers wanting to offer sizing recommendations. \nThe company also suggests additional uses-cases for its \u2018fat and all\u2019 3D body modeling tech in health and fitness tracking, and even equipment design and manufacturing. \nIn a video from 2015, O\u2019Farrell suggests highly accurate 3D body scans will enable \u201cthe body itself [to] be delivered as the platform and around which goods and services are designed, manufactured, bought and sold, recommended.\u201d \nIt\u2019s not clear exactly what Amazon intends to do with Body Labs but there are plenty of potential use-cases that mesh with and could extend its existing business interests if the startup has the tech chops to deliver accurate 3D body models at scale. \nFor example, as well as selling other brands\u2019 clothes via its ecommerce marketplace, Amazon has been ramping up its own fashion business in recent years, expanding and growing its private label fashion brands . \nBeing able to offer custom fit could give Amazon\u2019s private label fashion brands an edge, even as improving sizing predictions generally for Amazon shoppers could help drive clothes shopping across its platform and help shrink returns from clothes that don\u2019t fit. \nA recent Amazon Prime member perk offers free returns for a try-before-you-buy clothes service called Amazon Wardrobe . And the service would clearly be cheaper for Amazon to run if fewer people returned fewer items of clothes. \nCEO Jeff Bezos has long listed fashion as one of two key areas he sees underpinning his sizable ambitions for Amazon\u2019s ecommerce empire ( food being the other ). \nThe company also has big extant interests in another potential area where Body Labs\u2019 tech could fit: gaming. \nIt runs its own games studios \u2014 fed by earlier acquisitions such as Double Helix Games, which it picked up back in 2014 . It also distributes Lumberyard , a free AAA game engine integrated with AWS and Twitch; and offers GameLift , a managed service for deploying and managing servers for multiplayer games. \nThis summer it emerged the company had acquired GameSparks , a \u201cbackend as a service\u201d for games developers too. So it has a well established interest in pushing the envelop on video game content \u2014 say by being able to offer gamers photorealistic avatars. \nAnd that doesn\u2019t even scratch the surface of how 3D body model technology could play in the VR world, if you\u2019re taking a longer view on potential use-cases. (Or indeed, for AR and AR gaming purposes.) \nGames is generally an area of strategic interest for Amazon not only because the content can be highly popular and lucrative in its own right, but as another way to drive usage of its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services. The more content it can host, the more revenue AWS can generate. \nYet another potential use-case for 3D body model tech could be in the comms space where Amazon has recently been making a new play, including in the visual communications space \u2014 as part of a much bigger push to own the smart home by releasing a blitz of connected devices housing its Alexa voice AI. \nThis May Amazon outted an Echo device with a screen aimed at family videocalling. Oh hey there, Echo Look \nIt has also released another Echo device (called Look ) that\u2019s specifically designed for taking style selfies. So it\u2019s possible the company might be interested in tech that can power visual transformations for fun and fashion-based purposes \u2014 such as by being able to add real-time effects to people\u2019s faces and bodies during an Echo Show videocall, for example, a la Snapchat selfie lenses. \nAnd Body Labs has a mobile AI called Mosh for adding special effects photos using based on its tech detecting and adapting to the person\u2019s pose. \nOr \u2014 for more practical, ecommerce-related purposes \u2014 to enable users of its Echo Show to virtually show off a fashion item they\u2019re thinking of buying by having computer vision software digitally animating it on a photorealistic body model. So they could, for example, ask their mum for a second opinion on the dress they\u2019ve been eyeing up \u2014 and then just ask Alexa to buy it. \nHow Amazon could do much more with Echo by adding a camera to drive blended reality into the living room was a topic TechCrunch dug into back in 2015 . \nHowever one key consideration here, in the specific case of Body Labs, is it\u2019s not clear exactly what core technology the company is using for generating accurate 3D scans. \nIn some of its video demos Body Labs can be seen using person-sized scanners to generate highly accurate body models \u2014 a technology that clearly does not scale for the kind of massive consumer purposes Amazon would be after. Though it also claims to be able to extrapolate body models from \u201ceveryday photos or videos\u201d. \nOne of its co-founders, and also its science advisor, Dr Michael Black, is a computer vision expert who has worked on modeling realistic 3D human avatars by extrapolating pose data from photos \u2014 and that kind of approach, if it proves robust enough, would offer a more viable route for Amazon to scale viable body models to millions of consumers. \nSo it\u2019s also possible the Body Labs acquisition is mostly an acquihire for Amazon, aimed at picking up talent and expertise for handling the data it\u2019s hoping to gather via its Echo Look device which \u2014 notably \u2014 contains an on-board depth sensor so could be used to extract 3D data on body form via users\u2019 style selfies. \nAs we wrote in April , the Echo Look style selfie device very much looks like a way for Amazon to harvest people\u2019s full length selfies to start to build its own dataset for size and fit, which neatly dovetails with its ecommerce fashion ambitions. \nBezos could therefore be hoping to put Body Labs\u2019 team to work on reverse engineering the body data it pulls off Echo Look and arrive at viably accurate 3D body models without consumers needing their own shower-sized in-home scanners. Instead they\u2019d just need to have an Echo Look sitting on their shelf. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill o\u2019farrell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael black", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff bezoz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bezos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o\u2019farrell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "body labs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "max planck institute for intelligent systems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brown university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon wardrobe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon web services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netsuite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cosa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adobe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "speechworks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "openair", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T22:56:00.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b725ed9b84dd4481037bef05bfba0a3bb2bfb12f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.no3RwgBsid8ePoVEULMLXK5IFBv1.dLMdm_XwODLX1qWYzmO3ILFwRYP9Q_krZyXYgkFfzUdlmwEfLmgVVyx6Hu923z15Q6NkMweHkIZGhQw--", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/crunchgear", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Gadgets \u2013 TechCrunch", "title": "Optoma\u2019s NuForce BE Free8 wireless headphones are a smart AirPods alternative", "title_full": "Optoma\u2019s NuForce BE Free8 wireless headphones are a smart AirPods alternative", "published": "2017-10-03T23:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/lifestyle6.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 96, "comments": 0, "shares": 96}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 22}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b725ed9b84dd4481037bef05bfba0a3bb2bfb12f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.no3RwgBsid8ePoVEULMLXK5IFBv1.dLMdm_XwODLX1qWYzmO3ILFwRYP9Q_krZyXYgkFfzUdlmwEfLmgVVyx6Hu923z15Q6NkMweHkIZGhQw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Darrell Etherington", "published": "2017-10-03T23:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Optoma\u2019s NuForce BE Free8 wireless headphones are a smart AirPods alternative", "text": "Optoma has released new fully wireless headphones under its \u2018NuForce\u2019 audio sub brand, the BE Free8 earbuds . These are like Apple\u2019s AirPods, requiring no wire to connect them, and they connect via Bluetooth to any device. The charging pod they ship with even has a similar design to the AirPod case, and carries three backup charges for powering up on the go.\nThe NuForce Free8 carries up to four hours of use in the batteries built into the buds, and they come with a range of silicon tips to fit different ear canal shapes. They fit snugly in my own ear, and I was able to use them comfortably both when walking, and when running and working out, without any fear of them falling out.\nWhile they don\u2019t feel like super premium devices (the plastic used doesn\u2019t feel nearly as premium as that used in competing products, including the Bragi line and Apple\u2019s own AirPods) they have withstood a lot of high intensity use, including wear in light rain and a lot of sweat testing. Their durability seems proven, and I\u2019ve had a few weeks with them to identify any problem spots.\nThe other area where wireless earbuds tend to fall down is in connectivity \u2013 Bluetooth headsets are one thing, but totally wireless buds have two connectivity challenges to deal with. The NuForce Free8 performed well here, too, with very few dropouts during normal use. The one caveat here is that I did very occasionally have audio interruptions when my phone was in my right pocket front pants pocket, since they maintain their Bluetooth connection with your smartphone from the left earbud. These dropouts were very few and far between, however, and even the small number that did occur were easily remedied just by switching the pocket where I keep my phone.\nSound quality is also good. You\u2019ll hear a bit of low-level background hum during the most quiet parts, but it\u2019s hard to pick up, and the audio quality when music and podcasts are playing sound great, with good bass levels and excellent sound reproduction that sounds balanced overall. Sound isolation is also effective, providing a good seal in my experience for passively blocking out the surrounding street noise.\nWhen compared to most totally wireless buds out there, the Free8 is definitely towards the top of the group. It\u2019s still an area where there\u2019s room for improvement vs. wired buds, but these will definitely meet the needs of most users when it comes to sound reproduction, for both podcasts and music or video watching.\nThe case they ship with, in addition to holding backup charges for the headphones, also has indicator lights on the front for telling you when the buds are charging and when they\u2019re charged up, which is a nice touch when compared to the AirPods case from Apple. It also includes a micro USB port for charging, which is not great for longevity \u2013 only accessories have micro USB now, with just above every Android smartphone maker having moved to USB C other latest devices.\nThe NuForce BE Free8\u2019s biggest strength might be their $149 asking price, however, which is under that of many of its competitors . The earbuds also feature hardware button controls, which is another nice plus. If you\u2019re looking for a pair of totally wireless earbuds that aren\u2019t tied to Apple\u2019s platform, this is a good, if somewhat unexpected, place to look.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bragi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:02:37.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "59ee921de69ca69eb8734d7572a70eed3521f466", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.mohjG2dubZJ6Lc94YKZQKymN87YUejEIMADFNiItiMJ2wAtr9fdvDxpowpOHUZZ6oDmORqOD1rhg--", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/crunchgear", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Gadgets \u2013 TechCrunch", "title": "The Netgear ReadyNAS 524X is a data hoarder\u2019s delight", "title_full": "The Netgear ReadyNAS 524X is a data hoarder\u2019s delight", "published": "2017-10-03T22:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_3731.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 77, "comments": 2, "shares": 77}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 26}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "59ee921de69ca69eb8734d7572a70eed3521f466", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.mohjG2dubZJ6Lc94YKZQKymN87YUejEIMADFNiItiMJ2wAtr9fdvDxpowpOHUZZ6oDmORqOD1rhg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "John Biggs", "published": "2017-10-03T22:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Netgear ReadyNAS 524X is a data hoarder\u2019s delight", "text": "The Netgear ReadyNAS 524X is a data hoarder\u2019s delight Posted Advertisement As a member of the Data Generation, I\u2019ve found that my photos, videos, and documents quickly expand to fill their containers. A standard USB drive is quickly replaced by another, larger one while home network file servers fall by the wayside as they get full, old, and dangerously lossy. In short, it\u2019s time for the big guns. \nThat\u2019s why I was pleased to try out the Netgear ReadyNAS 524X, part of Netgear\u2019s new network attached storage series aimed at small businesses and home users. The diskless version costs about $800 and can hold up to 40TB. \nThis NAS is essentially a small computer. It can run apps including tools for BitTorrent downloads and remote backups and it uses XRAID to ensure hot-swapability on each drive. This feature, enabled by RAID6, allows for the catastrophic failure of up to two of the drives but causes a deep hit in storage capacity. This also means you can literally pull a disk out of this thing randomly and have the entire setup still run. If you want to know your real-world sizing with RAID6 enabled this calculator can help. I tested the performance by pulling two disks and everything worked perfectly although the reindexing process lasted over 24 hours each time the device was hit. Setup \nSetting up the drive is quite simple. To add a drive you simply pull out a carriage and snap the drive into place without tools. When you boot up for the first time you can begin a formatting process that brings all the drives online simultaneously. Then, when you need to swap one out, you can shut down the system manually and replace the drive offline. All you have to do is connect an Ethernet cable \u2013 this doesn\u2019t support Wi-Fi, and fire it up. \nOnce the NAS is up and running the system appears as a Windows and MacOS share. The drive can also support DLNA and UPnP and you can even SSH into the box where you\u2019ll find a standard Debian installation. This also means you can run cron jobs and even side load apps, a feature quite useful if you want to manage files with a little more granularity. Further, the NAS supports ReadyCloud, Netgear\u2019s own remote access protocol that lets you see files remotely. Further, you can connect the drive to Amazon S3, Google Drive, and Dropbox and sync folders back and forth. This makes it perfect for backing up live projects and maintaining a record of your remote files. \nHome users will be happy with the Plex support \u2013 Plex will scan any folder on the drive and serve it up piping hot to your TV \u2013 along with BitTorrent and NZB clients which are useful, obviously, for downloading public domain video from public servers. \nFinally if you stuff a load of music on here you\u2019ll also be able to access iTunes shares by clicking a button in the admin system. In short, this thing does it all. Latest Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Apps \nIf you dig deeper in the ReadyNAS app store you\u2019ll find a number of useful tools including a solution for recording surveillance video as well as systems for managing syncing across servers. The app store, in fact, is the coolest part of this NAS, turning it from a simple storage server into something immensely useful. \nFor example, you can install Drupal, an HTML5 based SSH terminal, and a Docker management tool right from the main admin screen. Many of the tools are fairly functional and aimed mostly at programmers who want to simulate remote storage conditions in their non-production code. \nBecause this NAS runs a Intel D1508 Dual Core 2.2GHz processor with 4GB of memory I haven\u2019t yet been able to max this thing out although Netgear recommends a maximum of 80 users. I personally tried many of the streaming apps and found them to be far more efficient than anything I\u2019ve used before, including a Plex server running on a 2014 iMac. Because this is essentially a Debian server it\u2019s quite capable and quite compact. Performance \nIn terms of performance this kit is obviously as good as your LAN network but I did a bit of testing using my home network and saw nothing untoward. If you\u2019re looking for solid benchmarks StorageReview posted a nice rundown but I\u2019ll show you what I found. \nI used a tool called Helios LanTest to read and write files to the drive. \nThe results showed real-world performance in my home network and modeling the same tests on the device itself took far less time \u2013 a few seconds. An 8GB library of music took about an hour to transfer over that same network \u2013 on par with anything else I\u2019ve seen in the space. Bottom Line \nThe 524X is a beast. I\u2019m used to using smaller devices with single drives and adding this to my network opened up a whole new world of, well, data hoarding. It\u2019s a file server, a testbed, a media streamer, and more and it\u2019s also a Debian machine and a great way to back up your computers. While the price is a little high \u2013 about $800 for a diskless unit \u2013 you\u2019re essentially getting a mini-PC with some definite RAID6 smarts. While it might be overkill for folks with a few baby pictures to back up, it\u2019s definitely worth a look if you keep lots of stuff on lots of servers. You will have so much more room for activities.

But Apple released the first beta version of iOS 11.1 last week and it fixed the issue with a simple software update. Apple expedited the bug fix and shipped a minor 11.0.2 bug fix update so that users don\u2019t have to wait for iOS 11.1. \nHead over to the Settings app on your iPhone, then tap \u2018General,\u2019 then \u2018Software Update.\u2019 Even if you don\u2019t have an iPhone 8 and are happy with iOS 11.0, Apple usually releases many bug fixes in the weeks following a major update. \nIf you want to download the update from your computer, plug your phone and launch iTunes to update. Don\u2019t forget to back up your device before updating. You never know what could go wrong. Make sure iCloud backups are working fine in your device settings, or back up your device using iTunes. 0 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gm", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:02:55.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d652a9b17cef5302a5d82070a564fea1eb4e4cde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.n6orJjs7XaOWaxLhbZrY5g4U6VFW3wPJonTcttZtkuVb1qqRGX_AUodfUqha5QVgx1.O4XbWd06APBaQvFBTIbqwncvSBReFA-", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/Microsoft", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Microsoft \u2013 TechCrunch", "title": "Microsoft\u2019s Mixed Reality platform is now open to SteamVR developers", "title_full": "Microsoft\u2019s Mixed Reality platform is now open to SteamVR developers", "published": "2017-10-03T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/cord_spiral_4k.png", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 139, "comments": 2, "shares": 139}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d652a9b17cef5302a5d82070a564fea1eb4e4cde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.n6orJjs7XaOWaxLhbZrY5g4U6VFW3wPJonTcttZtkuVb1qqRGX_AUodfUqha5QVgx1.O4XbWd06APBaQvFBTIbqwncvSBReFA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Frederic Lardinois", "published": "2017-10-03T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Microsoft\u2019s Mixed Reality platform is now open to SteamVR developers", "text": "Microsoft\u2019s Mixed Reality platform is now open to SteamVR developers Posted Samsung joins Microsoft\u2019s VR parade with its new high-end headset for Windows 10 It\u2019s no secret that Microsoft\u2019s Mixed Reality platform will support SteamVR games over time. That\u2019s a big deal because Steam is, after all, the largest store for buying PC games and Microsoft needs a large catalog of VR games to jumpstart its ecosystem. Until now, though, we didn\u2019t really know what the timeline for this would look like. \nAs the company announced today at a small press event in San Francisco, developers now have access to the Windows Mixed Reality SteamVR preview to help them test their games. This holiday season, consumers will also gain access to this preview program. \nIt\u2019s worth noting that Microsoft does call all of this a preview program, but there can be no doubt that SteamVR support is going to be very important to this platform. VR is already going through a bit of a tough phase and sales of existing headsets has slowed quite a bit. The last thing Microsoft wants is to have a lot of headsets on the market for the holidays but no content for its users. Both the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets currently support SteamVR games. \nEven with SteamVR support, it remains to be seen what the killer app for Windows Mixed Reality will be. The top-selling VR game on Steam right now is Job Simulator , followed by zombie apocalypse survival game Arizona Sunshine . \nMicrosoft also today demoed one if its first VR games, which unsurprisingly features its Halo franchise. Together with 343 Industries, Microsoft built a demo experience that brings the Halo characters to mixed reality for the first time. 0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "htc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona sunshine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:14:17.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "977945dea4ed83c65e97c73e81613663adf42f3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kAsfbqsZ6U5skeED0NsUhF5Q4IMdIIU8Ix.9jHuECM9F4ixDDiiq8W", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/startups", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Startups \u2013 TechCrunch", "title": "Jeffrey Katzenberg is looking to raise $2B for a new video startup", "title_full": "Jeffrey Katzenberg is looking to raise $2B for a new video startup", "published": "2017-10-03T23:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/1582495984_5a114e5df8_b.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 179, "comments": 4, "shares": 179}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 120}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "977945dea4ed83c65e97c73e81613663adf42f3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kAsfbqsZ6U5skeED0NsUhF5Q4IMdIIU8Ix.9jHuECM9F4ixDDiiq8W", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anthony Ha", "published": "2017-10-03T23:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jeffrey Katzenberg is looking to raise $2B for a new video startup", "text": "As tech giants like Apple and Facebook prepare to spend billions of dollars on movies and TV, longtime Hollywood executive Jeffrey Katzenberg is looking to write some big checks for original content, too.\nKatzenberg began his career at Paramount Pictures (where he worked on Star Trek: The Motion Picture ), but is best known for running Disney\u2019s motion picture division during the period in the late 1980s and early 1990s that saw the release of classics like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast , and then for founding DreamWorks and leading DreamWorks Animation, which was acquired last year by NBCUniversal .\nKatzenberg told The New York Times that he\u2019s building a new company that will develop high-quality, short-form video video for smartphones and tablets.

The company now believes that all of its three billion accounts were impacted, not 1 billion as it previously thought. This will include all people who have Yahoo emails, and all people who had registered for any other Yahoo service like Flickr or fantasy sports. \nThe company, now a part of Oath after it was acquired by Verizon for $4.5 billion and merged with AOL (which also owns TechCrunch), said that it discovered the new evidence while integrating the companies. \nIt tried to mitigate the blow today by noting that when the 2013 breach was discovered and disclosed \u2014 in 2016 \u2014 the company \u201ctook action to protect all accounts.\u201d \nThose measures involved directly notifying impacted users \u201cidentified at the time,\u201d requiring password changes and invalidating unencrypted security questions and answers so that they could not be used to access an account.

Payment card data and bank account information are not stored in the system the company believes was affected,\u201d said the company. More details here . \nCoupled with the revelation in September of the Equifax breach , today\u2019s developments tell a dark story about how some of the biggest and oldest institutions on the web are some of the most vulnerable to malicious hackers. \nYahoo\u2019s provided a list of guidelines for what to do to secure your account. And whether you are still sticking with the company after all this, or whether you are using other services, they are generally good rules of thumb if you don\u2019t follow them already: Change your passwords and security questions and answers for any other accounts on which you used the same or similar information used for your Yahoo Account (or whatever account happens to have been breached). Review your accounts for suspicious activity. Be cautious of any unsolicited communications that ask for your personal information or refer you to a web page asking for personal information. Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails. \nApps that provide account keys to eliminate you needing to use passwords at all can also be useful. \nThe full notice from Yahoo is below: NEW YORK, N.Y., October 3, 2017-Yahoo, now part of Oath, today announced that it is providing notice to additional user accounts affected by an August 2013 data theft previously disclosed by the company on December 14, 2016. At that time, Yahoo disclosed that more than one billion of the approximately three billion accounts existing in 2013 had likely been affected. In 2016, Yahoo took action to protect all accounts, including directly notifying impacted users identified at the time, requiring password changes and invalidating unencrypted security questions and answers so that they could not be used to access an account. Yahoo also notified users via a notice on its website. Subsequent to Yahoo\u2019s acquisition by Verizon, and during integration, the company recently obtained new intelligence and now believes, following an investigation with the assistance of outside forensic experts, that all Yahoo user accounts were affected by the August 2013 theft. While this is not a new security issue, Yahoo is sending email notifications to the additional affected user accounts. The investigation indicates that the user account information that was stolen did not include passwords in clear text, payment card data, or bank account information. The company is continuing to work closely with law enforcement. \u201cVerizon is committed to the highest standards of accountability and transparency, and we proactively work to ensure the safety and security of our users and networks in an evolving landscape of online threats,\u201d said Chandra McMahon, Chief Information Security Officer, Verizon. \u201cOur investment in Yahoo is allowing that team to continue to take significant steps to enhance their security, as well as benefit from Verizon\u2019s experience and resources.\u201d Additional information regarding this issue is available on the Yahoo 2013 Account Security Update FAQs page, https://yahoo.com/security-update .

The new branding aims to set Dropbox apart from other file syncing services by appealing to creative collaborators \u2014 but users probably won\u2019t see too many changes. \nGone are the whimsical colored pencil drawings (e.g. dinosaurs traipsing through the snow) of longtime creative director Jon Ying, who left the company last year. \n\u201cOur new illustration style picks up where our earliest style\u2014loose, handmade, witty\u2014left off,\u201d write creative director Aaron Robbs and VP of Design Nicholas Jitkoff. The new visual style, made in collaboration with design house Collins, appears to avoid primary and secondary colors at all costs while keeping whitespace everything but white. It juxtaposes graphite drawings with collaged elements and other computer-generated imagery. \nThe typeface, Sharp Grotesk , was designed by foundry Sharp Type, inspired by hand-drawn poster lettering and the work of Swiss designer Adrian Frutiger. It has plenty of variations, from squat and heavy to ultra-narrow. Of course it\u2019s a matter of taste, but none of us here are particularly into it. It is, however, original while not being totally outlandish. \nIt\u2019s a throwback color aesthetic (these color combinations are very \u201970s modern) combined with a post-Helvetica-Neue type aesthetic, and these things don\u2019t always play well together. At least it\u2019s distinctive. \nThat said, chances are users won\u2019t see these things too much \u2014 this is all really for a marketing push that deliberately embraces weirdness in order to set Dropbox apart from its more staid competition. The type isn\u2019t going to appear when you open your Dropbox menu or in your web file list. Those need to remain usable and so will likely retain the default sans-serif look, though you can expect some flair here and there from the new-look book. Old at top, new below. Personally, I prefer the geometric type. \nWhile we\u2019re divided on the brand aesthetic, we like the new logo. While the old one was pretty clearly an actual box, the new one reduces that graphic to its basic shapes: a group of five isometric squares, or what laypeople call \u201cdiamonds.\u201d The image is open to interpretation but still recognizably a box, avoiding missteps made by Airbnb and Uber. Ironically while the logo itself became more geometric, the type became less so (most visible with the clipped bars and rather off-kilter counters in the p and b). \nThose companies totally redid their looks but failed to do so cogently: Airbnb\u2019s pretentious new logo, the \u201cB\u00e9lo,\u201d aimed high but ultimately just reminded users of a combination of various reproductive and non-reproductive organs. Uber\u2019s similarly high-concept redo was simply incomprehensible. Microsoft threw away decades of colorful history with its Windows 10 logo and replaced it with something deeply bland. \nConsidering the failures of major tech companies in attempting the task of a reinvention, Dropbox\u2019s work here is on the whole admirable. We look forward to using the new geometric logo and the focus on creatives is welcome and smart. The full story of the redesign can be scrolled through interminably here .

However, a patch for that vulnerability had been available for months before the breach occurred. \nNow several top Equifax execs are being taken to task for failing to protect the information of millions of U.S. citizens. In a live stream before the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce committee, Smith testified the Struts vulnerability had been discussed when it was first announced by CERT on March 8th. \nSmith said when he started with Equifax 12 years ago there was no one in cybersecurity. The company has poured a quarter of a billion dollars into cybersecurity in the last three years and today boasts a 225 person team. \nHowever, Smith had an interesting explainer for how this easy fix slipped by 225 people\u2019s notice \u2014 one person didn\u2019t do their job. \n\u201cThe human error was that the individual who\u2019s responsible for communicating in the organization to apply the patch, did not,\u201d Smith, who did not name this individual, told the committee. \nThe notion that just one person didn\u2019t do their job and led to the biggest breach in history is quite an amazing claim and shows a fundamental lack of good security practices. But that\u2019s what Smith says led to this disaster. \nAccording to Smith\u2019s written testimony, Equifax sent out an internal email on March 9th to deploy the Apache Struts update within 48 hours. However, Smith said, the system failed to identify any vulnerabilities. A few days later, the IT department also ran scans but failed to recognize the vulnerability. Then it was apparently all up to one person to communicate that there was a patch available for a discovered vulnerability. \nHackers, who quickly recognized the vulnerability, despite a team of 225 cybersecurity experts at one of the largest credit reporting agencies failing to do so, started to access the sensitive information on March 13th and continued to do so over a period of months. \nEquifax is still investigating the details of what happened and Smith said providing consumers with adequate information in the aftermath was \u201cchallenging.\u201d \nEquifax has been raked over the coals for offering up a separate website to tell consumers seemingly at random if they\u2019d been affected by the hack. The site not only proved unhelpful and confusing, it then directed many to sign up for Equifax\u2019s credit monitoring product TrustID. Language in the Terms of Service attached to TrustID prevented those who signed up from suing the company. Equifax since sent out a statement retracting that language and saying consumers could sue, which they have started to do . \nSmith stepped down as CEO last week, shortly after the company\u2019s chief security officer and chief information officer also exited the company. New York has also issued a subpoena in regards to the massive breach and the city of San Francisco has opened up a lawsuit against Equifax on behalf of the 15 million Californians affected by the hack. \nSomething else problematic for the committee questioning Smith \u2013 the sale of $1.8 million in stock by three top individuals within the company on August 1 and 2, within the time they would have known about the hack. \n\u201cI\u2019ve know these individual for up to 12 years. They\u2019re men of integrity. I have no indication that they had any knowledge of the breach when they made this sale,\u201d Smith said, pointing out it wasn\u2019t unusual for individuals to sell within the quarterly earnings window. \nThere are still more hearings to come \u2014 tomorrow company execs will speak with the Senate Banking committee, on Thursday they\u2019ll meet with the House Financial Services committee. But if today is any indication, there\u2019s still more chances for blame to go around.

Uber trial would be delayed until December 4th. The trial had initially been expected to start with jury selection next Tuesday on October 10th. Ultimately this gives Waymo additional time to review new documents associated with the Stroz report in advance of the start of the trial. \nWaymo has been pushing for the delay to account for the mountain of materials in need of review surrounding Stroz\u2019s due diligence report. The report, which was published online last night , was commissioned to explore potential IP concerns around Uber\u2019s acquisition of Otto. \nDuring arguments today, Waymo\u2019s legal team noted that the volume of documents related to the report is \u201cshocking.\u201d These are documents that Waymo is just getting its hands on and has not fully evaluated in advance of the start of the trial. Part of the team\u2019s irritation is that it has allegedly asked for these documents to be sent over multiple times with no headway made. \nUber on the other hand has been cautious about letting pre-trial discovery drag on. Its legal team says that the majority of the documents Waymo wants to dig through have been secured in a storage facility since 2010. They assert that Waymo has already spent 4,450 hours reviewing materials and that the company is unlikely to find additional evidence in the old collection of documents. \nMeanwhile Judge Alsup remains frustrated with both sides for presenting in \u201chalf truths.\u201d Alsup said that despite the quality of the lawyers he has had to evaluate everything said. He spent significant time today evaluating the validity of statements made by both sides. \n\u201cI believe that Waymo has exaggerated the need for continuance and it\u2019s not nearly as dire as what has been represented to me,\u201d Judge Alsup asserted. \nDespite his annoyance, he still decided to grant a continuance \u2014 a delay in the start of the trial. Jury selection will now occur on Nov 29th. The trial will run from December 4th until December 20th. \nThe delay did come with terms however. Judge Alsup\u2019s new schedule is non negotiable and prevents new discovery absent stipulation or a overriding decision from Magistrate Judge Corley. \nOver the coming weeks, Waymo will be looking to tie one of its trade secrets to Uber\u2019s work. Waymo will be allowed to bring a motion to amend its list of nine trade secrets, alleged to have been stolen by Uber, up until October 23rd. \nThat list of nine trade secrets is said to be cemented barring an extreme discovery. If a major discovery is made and the list is allowed to be amended, Uber would be granted additional discovery. \nUber sent the following comment following the decision. \u201cThe Court has made clear that Waymo\u2019s case is not what they hoped, and that more time will not change the hard fact that their trade secrets never came to Uber. We\u2019re ready to go to trial now, and will be ready after this very brief continuance.\u201d Featured Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:22:14.041+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e850681123604ad30c11af64e474b37f7dba8fac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kuAhBdVRIU6W.IjX4rq7pLYb3EKyCajeaH7ivDQZ_MQFmASDssB3pC5t6pZjOy6yOyQMfwG8szi1u_9xDSxT3w6jOSFaeGjhwSCCQXFomeY7HEbmB_z3tq", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TechCrunch", "title": "Elements, Stripe\u2019s new check-out toolkit, aims to boost e-commerce sales completions", "title_full": "Elements, Stripe\u2019s new check-out toolkit, aims to boost e-commerce sales completions", "published": "2017-10-03T21:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/elements-sample-images.png", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 151, "comments": 2, "shares": 151}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 270}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e850681123604ad30c11af64e474b37f7dba8fac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kuAhBdVRIU6W.IjX4rq7pLYb3EKyCajeaH7ivDQZ_MQFmASDssB3pC5t6pZjOy6yOyQMfwG8szi1u_9xDSxT3w6jOSFaeGjhwSCCQXFomeY7HEbmB_z3tq", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ingrid Lunden", "published": "2017-10-03T21:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Elements, Stripe\u2019s new check-out toolkit, aims to boost e-commerce sales completions", "text": "Stripe, the payments startup is now valued at $9 billion , is today taking the wraps off its latest effort to help its customers \u2014 which now number in the hundreds of thousands, and include companies like Lyft, Salesforce, Facebook, Deliveroo, and the U.K. government \u2014 generate more transactions, and thus greater returns for Stripe itself.\nIt is launching Elements , a free toolkit that Stripe is rolling out globally for Stripe users to build customised checkout experiences.\nSimilar to Stripe\u2019s core payment service \u2014 which works by way of an API, meaning users simply add a few short lines of code to bring the payment feature into their site or app \u2014 Elements is based on \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d that companies can use to add in different features like alternate and localized payment methods, autofilling scripts, mobile payments, and responsive design that adjusts to whatever screen is being used. You can see some examples and test them out (if you are so inclined) here .\nElements is significant for a few reasons:\nThrough Elements, Stripe is making an effort to tackle one of the larger pain points and most persistent problems in the world of online commerce: shopping cart abandonment.\nOn average, nearly 70 percent of all e-commerce visits fail to result in actual sales. While some of that may be due to people simply not prepared yet to buy, or a price turning out to be too high, another big reason is a range of issues related to the check-out process, such as lack of payment methods, credit card declines and complicated check-out processes:\nStripe itself found that in its own analysis of the world\u2019s 100 biggest commerce sites that 72 of them had three or more errors in their checkout flows, nearly half did not use auto-fill correctly, and one-fifth were failing to revert to numerical keypads for entering credit card numbers on mobile.\nThe introduction of Elements also comes at a time when Stripe is growing more into its skin as a payments behemoth, doing more than just providing an API for companies to take payments.\n\u201cWhat led us to build this was less a specific request from a set of users, and more our team realizing that this is something that affects literally every online business, and Stripe is in a position to help,\u201dsaid Lachy Groom, Stripe\u2019s head of payments products.\n\u201cTo be honest, we didn\u2019t realize how useful something like Elements would be when we first started building Stripe. Now we\u2019re about six years in, supporting hundreds of thousands of users, and what we\u2019ve found is that, time and time again, each individual business is reinventing the wheel. And it\u2019s actually a pretty complicated wheel: there are hundreds of small things to tweak and optimize for,\u201d he said.\nThis has been a gradual evolution for the company: it has over the years added in new services like Radar, to help with fraud prevention, and an easy way for businesses to incorporate in the U.S. when they are based abroad.\nAtlas, the incorporation product, is now available in 125 countries after getting open to US-based founders earlier this year. Radar, Groom said, \u201cis also doing well, with lots of companies planning to rely on Radar for the upcoming holiday season.\u201d There is apparently an update coming on that product that is likely to hit before the holiday season, when online shopping goes bananas.\nWhile Elements is free to use for Stripe customers, it\u2019s also interesting move by the company as it continues to lock down different elements of the both the commerce experience and the act of running a business online.\nKey to Stripe\u2019s message has always been the convenience factor, and as more companies incorporate online into their bigger strategies, or refresh their legacy systems with better and more updated technology, Stripe has an opportunity to snag a lot of business from the old guard.\nGroom would not comment on IPO plans.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:22:15.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9ed696dc1fbcb2821aee8e00143d772ef2f308f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.m_0ZeKHPoEgRdBf0MZmoXJl0OKo.f8ss4S9ahAPEgy.jYxKM7ST3trW_ZgDrxcGNs-", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TechCrunch", "title": "Instagram Stories mimics Polly with new polls", "title_full": "Instagram Stories mimics Polly with new polls", "published": "2017-10-03T21:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_2080.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 377, "comments": 2, "shares": 377}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 229}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9ed696dc1fbcb2821aee8e00143d772ef2f308f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.m_0ZeKHPoEgRdBf0MZmoXJl0OKo.f8ss4S9ahAPEgy.jYxKM7ST3trW_ZgDrxcGNs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Josh Constine", "published": "2017-10-03T21:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Instagram Stories mimics Polly with new polls", "text": "Polly blew up with teens last month by tacking multiple-choice polling onto Snapchat.

Friends will see results as soon as they answer, and you\u2019ll find who voted for what in your Stories view count page.\nPolls could make Instagram Stories more interactive instead of something you rapidly fast-forward through. Hopefully multiple-choice answers are coming beyond the existing binary choices.\nInstagram is also becoming closer to a mobile Photoshop with its new color dropper feature that lets you sample a color from your image to draw or add text with a matching hue. Plus, Instagram now makes it easy to center and level stickers and text.\nInstagram\u2019s willingness to launch not only Snapchat\u2019s features but those built by smaller startups shows how it\u2019s putting the user experience above its own pride or perception amongst pundits.

Yeah, it was that lame. \nAs background, yesterday Snapchat posted a mysterious countdown timer on a domain named art.snapchat.com that was reminiscent of the countdown timers announcing the next location of a Spectacle-selling Snapbot . But the countdown timer relied on client-side JS, meaning some smart TC readers were able to spoof the timing and see what was hiding behind the timer . \nThe surprise was a new program designed to place giant AR art sculptures in hotspots around the world that you\u2019d only be able to view via Snapchat. The first featured artist was Jeff Koons, known for his giant faux balloon sculptures. IMG_0247 2 Image uploaded from iOS (1) Image uploaded from iOS (3) Previous Next Exit \nAnyways, today at 3pm ET when the countdown time ended I was camped out in Central Park, which was one of the locations shown when the website went down. At 3pm a forward-facing world lens appeared with the small icon being a yellow Jeff Koons balloon sculpture. When activated, a pin appeared in the distance indicating I was 115 meters away from the sculpture. \nThis updated in real time and indicated which direction to walk and how far away I was as I walked closer. Snapchat\u2019s website now also shows you the exact coordinates of each AR sculpture. \nTo be honest, this scavenge hunt-style search was the most fun part of the whole experience. The augmented reality demo itself was really mediocre, and much less impressive than any decently made ARKit game. \nI finally found the giant yellow AR balloon animal in the middle of an open concourse in Central Park. But it wasn\u2019t as perfect as the image above \u2014 it took me about five tries of closing and opening the app to get it to look as good as it does in the photo above. The first few times the AR sculpture was changing locations, floating randomly in the sky, and overlaying itself on concrete pillars like shown below. \nRendering the AR art must have been processor intense \u2014 I have the newest iPhone 8 Plus and the entire app was still running slowly. At one point my phone crashed and spent about 30 seconds with a black screen and spinning loading indicator, though I was also frequently taking screenshots and using Apple\u2019s screen recording feature, which, to be fair, may have taken up some processing power. Using Snapchat for about 10 minutes to view the sculpture also drained about 10 percent of my battery. \nFor what it\u2019s worth, I seemed to be the only one there that knew about the new AR feature, so it definitely wasn\u2019t reminiscent of Snapchat\u2019s promotional video where dozens of people were crowded around an open space. \nThat being said, the idea is cool. Once I got it displayed correctly it was fun to walk around the sculpture and see the world reflected around me \u2014 it almost felt like I was at The Bean in Chicago . But it\u2019s still probably not the best demo of augmented reality \u2014 I know my non-technical friends would be much more impressed with an ARKit demo than seeing this. \nIf Snapchat can iron out the tech issues, it\u2019s neat to put an AR sculpture for people to come see in real life. And once I got the sculpture to display correctly I could walk up to it and see it from all angles, and even my surroundings in its reflection \u2014 which definitely isn\u2019t an easy technological feat. Snapchat has opened submissions to other artists, so expect to see a sculpture in a major city near you soon.

This is not large premium compared to Truphone\u2019s last reported round and is far less than the total the company has raised in its life: In 2013 Truphone raised \u00a375 million at a \u00a3300 million valuation, and to date, it has raised just under $600 million. \nA large part of today\u2019s investment, Steffens said, was being made to pay down Truphone\u2019s debt and go forward with a clean slate. \nThe company has been around since 2006 (I\u2019m guessing it may have outlasted the statute of limitations on being called a \u201cstartup\u201d) and in the last three to four years specifically has racked up about \u00a3239 million in debt, Steffens said, as it was expanding its business. \nThe rest is going towards investing back into the company and specifically into acquisitions to further its business in IoT, an area where Truphone has been laying some groundwork already. \u201cWe\u2019re making a strategic acquisition that we may announce in a matter of days,\u201d he said. \nThe rush of new, smart devices that work in part by connecting to the internet is bringing in a new group of startups to provide that connectivity. In addition to Truphone, others in the same area of business include Cubic Telecom \u2014 which works with Audi on connected vehicles and also recently raised some funding to fuel its growth. \nTruphone, Steffens said, does have a deal \u201cwith a carmaker\u201d too (although he declined to name it), but he said that its interest in IoT goes beyond that. \u201cWe were focused on the automotive industry initially, but in the last six to nine months, we have had a substantial pull from other verticals.\u201d \nInterestingly, Truphone\u2019s basic technology is at the root both of the company\u2019s legacy business, and the business it hopes to tap into in the future. \nTruphone\u2019s original premise of offering low-cost international voice and data plans for users was based on software that essentially patched together capacity from multiple carriers across multiple countries. That gave Truphone users the ability to buy one allowance and use it roaming in other countries for no extra charge. \nThe play now for providers of these services is to use that same framework of cheap voice and data and apply it to any device that might need it, be it a vehicle or your new home alarm or a machine at a factory. While it\u2019s pretty obvious that your home alarm doesn\u2019t need to roam, what it could mean is that a phone service can be integrated at the point of manufacture, and can then work wherever the hardware is subsequently distributed and sold. \n\u201cWe have a high degree of confidence from the investor community that we are on the right track,\u201d Steffens said of Truphone\u2019s move deeper into IoT. \u201cWe are having increasingly very relevant conversations with tier-one and blue-chip companies to offer advanced solutions.\u201d These, he said, could be in automotive vehicles as well as the wider range of \u2018smart\u2019 devices that are coming to market. \nMeanwhile, company\u2019s current business continues to build on its legacy services. \nThese include Truphone\u2019s low-cost mobile services that are usable in some 220 countries, ongoing services for 3,500 enterprise customers (an obvious target market for roaming packages), and newer initiatives like a strategic partnership with Apple. \nTruphone works as a connectivity provider for Apple\u2019s e-Sim-based hardware, which today is only covering its iPad tablets, but could potentially extend into Truphone working on Apple\u2019s smartwatches and phones. Steffens describes this partnership as going \u201c full speed ahead\u201d at the moment. Truphone is targeting to be live on Apple\u2019s devices in 30 markets by the end of this year, and 54 by next year. \nSteffens added that Truphone is \u201cwell on track to be profitable\u201d in 2018. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t require heroic efforts on our part, nor larger tier-one engagements, I mean just as the business stands today.\u201d \nFeatured Image: NicoElNino/Getty Images ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roman abramovich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "truphone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steffens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph steffens", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "views truphone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "audi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cubic telecom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vollin holdings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "truphone", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "truphone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minden", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:34:43.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4feccfb2988de198de42127712f6ae90505cec09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.koDTFiDVyM2V4QTLt_os6w2STY_VeYt95NT6zAorhKey.1rgjVypSPaaP2S4A4Kej1qP2SAF76ZLKb.kSRA9mDizU9Vo1In8fMRG9S.OAT6bOyR7ScUVQlgfuKEwQV43Y-", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "GROW raises $2.4M to to build a smart planter for easy-to-cultivate vegetables | Tech news data", "title_full": "GROW raises $2.4M to to build a smart planter for easy-to-cultivate vegetables | Tech news data", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "http://technewsdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/5_laying-seedsheet-660x330.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 479}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4feccfb2988de198de42127712f6ae90505cec09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.koDTFiDVyM2V4QTLt_os6w2STY_VeYt95NT6zAorhKey.1rgjVypSPaaP2S4A4Kej1qP2SAF76ZLKb.kSRA9mDizU9Vo1In8fMRG9S.OAT6bOyR7ScUVQlgfuKEwQV43Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "GROW raises $2.4M to to build a smart planter for easy-to-cultivate vegetables | Tech news data", "text": "Home / Gadgets / GROW raises $2.4M to to build a smart planter for easy-to-cultivate vegetables GROW raises $2.4M to to build a smart planter for easy-to-cultivate vegetables techguy 4 hours ago Gadgets Leave a comment 5 Views Boxee co-founder Idan Cohen\u2019s most recent stint may have been in the smart TV space \u2014 but now he wants to build a box that\u2019ll help you grow some lettuce outside your home. \nThat might seem weird, but after many dinners spent feeding guests with vegetables grown from his roof, he and his team are now launching a smart planter called GROW . Initially starting as a hobby to grow vegetables he couldn\u2019t find in the United States, Cohen\u2019s rooftop garden has now morphed into a startup that\u2019s raised $2.4 million in a financing round led by Resolute Venture. It starts at $249, with a pre-sale of $199 starting first. The company then hopes to have an accompanying recurring model where you get seeds and such over time, giving it a continuous business for everyone that ends up buying a planter. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was doing, but being an engineer this made me think there\u2019s a better way to do it,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason I need to do conflations in my head when we can sense when I should plant my tomatoes. It made me think we could develop a vertically integrated solution, a smart planter that has some sensors and auto irrigation \u2014 which can make it hard for people to figure out whether you\u2019re watering too much or too little \u2014 and give them advice using all these sensors.\u201d \nGROW, at its heart, is a planter. You buy it, put soil in it, lay down some seeds, and in theory harvest some greens from it eventually. But like many other techy approaches to traditional hobbies led by founders who build techy approaches to traditional hobbies, the GROW planter is designed to help you handle any speedbumps (or inexperience) to ensure that your gardening process still ends up with something that ends up on your plate. GROW sends over seeds, soil, and nutrients, and tracks everything to ensure the environment stays healthy. \nThis then feeds into your phone, which gets a microclimate profile and the best advice for how to manage your plants and ensure they end up with something you can actually eat. Each plant has a kit, and the hope is that the company can figure out which vegetables are most likely to be successful in your climate. Then, you get seeds or seedlings, as well as nutrients, through the life cycle of the plant and instructions as you go along. \nHere\u2019s the kicker, though: the barrier to entry for something like this is going to be pretty high, and not because of the price. GROW requires a water source for its irrigation, which means if that\u2019s not handy this won\u2019t be something for you just yet. All this means that GROW is, at least initially, going to be a niche product for those with an itch for gardening and the resources to build a more robust garden otherwise. While Cohen may have worked with this idea from a rooftop to begin, the whole concept is to reduce the initial effort required to tap into that latent green thumb \u2014 but that means starting with the most accessible audience first. \nThe whole process still required a bit of a balance between making it automated and easy and still accounting for the zen that comes with gardening. It takes away the everyday ritual of watering, which might be something that you\u2019re into doing as a cool-off-from-work kind of thing, but that\u2019s intentional because the goal is to actually get vegetables growing and helping you actually pick something healthy. That\u2019s just one example of a careful balancing act that GROW had to take, which we\u2019ll have to see play out before we know whether or not the planter finds that sweet spot. \nGROW is also starting off as something that\u2019s only for sale on GROW\u2019s website. The company might end up in retail stores, but that\u2019s further down the timeline \u2014 as it\u2019s something that can lead to a ton of challenges for a company that\u2019s building a hard physical product that people will buy. \u201cWe definitely learned that mistake at Boxee, and as soon as we went to retail it became much harder to keep it as a leader,\u201d Cohen said. \n\u201cWhen you hand off the relationships, you don\u2019t own the salespeople,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIt becomes hard to control the message. When you control the whole funnel, basically the journey from coming to a website down to supporting the customer through usage, it\u2019s much easier online. One of the lessons is we\u2019re not gonna move [into retail] quickly.\u201d \nThere\u2019s going to be plenty of competition for GROW. There are a lot of companies attempting the kind of let\u2019s-grow-real-plants-in-climates-where-they-don\u2019t-necessarily-belong projects, like Agricool, which just raised $9.1 million . Starting off with a niche, GROW is going to have to make a very good product that consumes the entire wants of that niche and then eventually expand to other low hanging fruit (like a table in an apartment, hint hint). GROW is also going to have to make sure it delivers on those continuous touchpoints and work with customers throughout the entire growing cycle of their plants. \u201cBuilding hardware wasn\u2019t easy, but these days hardware has a lot of advantages,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThe world of consumer software is so saturated and noisy. Hardware has the advantage of building slowly a customer base of people paying hard dollars. The main lesson I\u2019ve learned in building products is to build one with a service layer. Some kind of recurring revenue is very important.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cohen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idan cohen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "resolute venture", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agricool", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boxee", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:34:48.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d8a87c38d30ec06693d0dfe08791f39e54d13a93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.lCFErv36YZJ.kBBrlU46cjqvYZlDshr9WNux28M7p6UdKieGCoNeNVNXZF3pXa7OE-", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feedproxy.google.com/TechCrunch", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TechCrunch", "title": "Former Intel CEO Paul Otellini passes away", "title_full": "Former Intel CEO Paul Otellini passes away", "published": "2017-10-04T00:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/gettyimages-136706320.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 536, "comments": 0, "shares": 536}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 123}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d8a87c38d30ec06693d0dfe08791f39e54d13a93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.lCFErv36YZJ.kBBrlU46cjqvYZlDshr9WNux28M7p6UdKieGCoNeNVNXZF3pXa7OE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Devin Coldewey", "published": "2017-10-04T00:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Former Intel CEO Paul Otellini passes away", "text": "Former Intel CEO Paul Otellini passes away Posted Hands-on with Samsung\u2019s Odyssey VR headset for Windows 10 Paul Otellini, who presided over Intel during some of its most prosperous years, passed away today at the age of 66.

It\u2019s the company\u2019s first headset that operates with a PC powering it rather than a smartphone, and first impressions indicate that the company did a pretty stellar job. \nI had a few minutes to play around with the Odyssey today at Microsoft\u2019s mixed reality event, and what\u2019s clear is that the headset delivers an experience that is pretty indistinguishable from the top competitors like Oculus and HTC on a similarly specced PC. \nThe headset is the most expensive Windows 10 option currently, at $499, while Acer\u2019s headset is the cheapest with its bundle retailing for $399. It\u2019s nice that Microsoft has some varying price levels, but it\u2019s hard to think of reasons to recommend buying the lower-specced headsets when Samsung\u2019s options show off far more than a $100 jump in quality. \nThe star of the headset is definitely the display quality, which forgoes the lower-quality LCD screens that all the other announced headsets are using, in favor of AMOLED, which will allow for a more responsive experience that should reduce discomfort. The Odyssey is also a jump in resolution from the other headsets\u2019 1440\u00d71440 per eye displays to a wider 1440\u00d71600 per eye setup. \nNone of this matters much if you\u2019re running on integrated graphics, which Microsoft gives as an option, but I haven\u2019t found to be the most pleasant experience. If you have a machine with decent discrete graphics, you\u2019re going to have a noticeably smoother experience with Odyssey over the headsets from the other OEMs. \nWhile I\u2019m still partial to the build quality on the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive over the Odyssey, Samsung has built a headset that feels very substantial and offers a few sorely lacking features from what other OEMs have shown off. \nThe integrated AKG headphones, all prepped and ready for 360-degree spatial sound, are pretty nice, but the biggest thing is that they\u2019re just there and are one less thing you\u2019ll have to fiddle around with before diving into an experience. \nWe\u2019ve talked at length about the setup process and the quality of the motion-tracked controllers for Windows 10, but Samsung\u2019s headset really makes up for most of the gripes I had about the previous setups. \nIf you\u2019re going to buy a Windows 10 headset, and, to be fair, that\u2019s still a big \u201cif,\u201d this is the one to get. 0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "acer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "htc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:56:17.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4feccfb2988de198de42127712f6ae90505cec09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.koDTFiDVyM2V4QTLt_os6w2STY_VeYt95NT6zAorhKey.1rgjVypSPaaP2S4A4Kej1qP2SAF76ZLKb.kSRA9mDizU9Vo1In8fMRG9S.OAT6bOyR7ScUVQlgfuKEwQV43Y-", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://technewsdata.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Tech news data", "title": "GROW raises $2.4M to to build a smart planter for easy-to-cultivate vegetables", "title_full": "GROW raises $2.4M to to build a smart planter for easy-to-cultivate vegetables", "published": "2017-10-03T20:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://technewsdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/5_laying-seedsheet-660x330.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 431}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4feccfb2988de198de42127712f6ae90505cec09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.koDTFiDVyM2V4QTLt_os6w2STY_VeYt95NT6zAorhKey.1rgjVypSPaaP2S4A4Kej1qP2SAF76ZLKb.kSRA9mDizU9Vo1In8fMRG9S.OAT6bOyR7ScUVQlgfuKEwQV43Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "techguy", "published": "2017-10-03T20:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "GROW raises $2.4M to to build a smart planter for easy-to-cultivate vegetables", "text": "Home / Gadgets / GROW raises $2.4M to to build a smart planter for easy-to-cultivate vegetables GROW raises $2.4M to to build a smart planter for easy-to-cultivate vegetables techguy 20 hours ago Gadgets Leave a comment 12 Views Boxee co-founder Idan Cohen\u2019s most recent stint may have been in the smart TV space \u2014 but now he wants to build a box that\u2019ll help you grow some lettuce outside your home. \nThat might seem weird, but after many dinners spent feeding guests with vegetables grown from his roof, he and his team are now launching a smart planter called GROW . Initially starting as a hobby to grow vegetables he couldn\u2019t find in the United States, Cohen\u2019s rooftop garden has now morphed into a startup that\u2019s raised $2.4 million in a financing round led by Resolute Venture. It starts at $249, with a pre-sale of $199 starting first. The company then hopes to have an accompanying recurring model where you get seeds and such over time, giving it a continuous business for everyone that ends up buying a planter. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was doing, but being an engineer this made me think there\u2019s a better way to do it,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason I need to do conflations in my head when we can sense when I should plant my tomatoes. It made me think we could develop a vertically integrated solution, a smart planter that has some sensors and auto irrigation \u2014 which can make it hard for people to figure out whether you\u2019re watering too much or too little \u2014 and give them advice using all these sensors.\u201d \nGROW, at its heart, is a planter. You buy it, put soil in it, lay down some seeds, and in theory harvest some greens from it eventually. But like many other techy approaches to traditional hobbies led by founders who build techy approaches to traditional hobbies, the GROW planter is designed to help you handle any speedbumps (or inexperience) to ensure that your gardening process still ends up with something that ends up on your plate. GROW sends over seeds, soil, and nutrients, and tracks everything to ensure the environment stays healthy. \nThis then feeds into your phone, which gets a microclimate profile and the best advice for how to manage your plants and ensure they end up with something you can actually eat. Each plant has a kit, and the hope is that the company can figure out which vegetables are most likely to be successful in your climate. Then, you get seeds or seedlings, as well as nutrients, through the life cycle of the plant and instructions as you go along. \nHere\u2019s the kicker, though: the barrier to entry for something like this is going to be pretty high, and not because of the price. GROW requires a water source for its irrigation, which means if that\u2019s not handy this won\u2019t be something for you just yet. All this means that GROW is, at least initially, going to be a niche product for those with an itch for gardening and the resources to build a more robust garden otherwise. While Cohen may have worked with this idea from a rooftop to begin, the whole concept is to reduce the initial effort required to tap into that latent green thumb \u2014 but that means starting with the most accessible audience first. \nThe whole process still required a bit of a balance between making it automated and easy and still accounting for the zen that comes with gardening. It takes away the everyday ritual of watering, which might be something that you\u2019re into doing as a cool-off-from-work kind of thing, but that\u2019s intentional because the goal is to actually get vegetables growing and helping you actually pick something healthy. That\u2019s just one example of a careful balancing act that GROW had to take, which we\u2019ll have to see play out before we know whether or not the planter finds that sweet spot. \nGROW is also starting off as something that\u2019s only for sale on GROW\u2019s website. The company might end up in retail stores, but that\u2019s further down the timeline \u2014 as it\u2019s something that can lead to a ton of challenges for a company that\u2019s building a hard physical product that people will buy. \u201cWe definitely learned that mistake at Boxee, and as soon as we went to retail it became much harder to keep it as a leader,\u201d Cohen said. \n\u201cWhen you hand off the relationships, you don\u2019t own the salespeople,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIt becomes hard to control the message. When you control the whole funnel, basically the journey from coming to a website down to supporting the customer through usage, it\u2019s much easier online. One of the lessons is we\u2019re not gonna move [into retail] quickly.\u201d \nThere\u2019s going to be plenty of competition for GROW. There are a lot of companies attempting the kind of let\u2019s-grow-real-plants-in-climates-where-they-don\u2019t-necessarily-belong projects, like Agricool, which just raised $9.1 million . Starting off with a niche, GROW is going to have to make a very good product that consumes the entire wants of that niche and then eventually expand to other low hanging fruit (like a table in an apartment, hint hint). GROW is also going to have to make sure it delivers on those continuous touchpoints and work with customers throughout the entire growing cycle of their plants. \u201cBuilding hardware wasn\u2019t easy, but these days hardware has a lot of advantages,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThe world of consumer software is so saturated and noisy. Hardware has the advantage of building slowly a customer base of people paying hard dollars. The main lesson I\u2019ve learned in building products is to build one with a service layer. Some kind of recurring revenue is very important.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cohen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idan cohen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "resolute venture", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agricool", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boxee", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:01:30.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "00591b773c2074b4c6f39a3e3eacd58f39552300", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.mohjG2dubZJ9aHfDlgQjUJ5Eu9r2v743.oWfsnOgYvFRcnx5DNfyUgpQB4JLPBSwQegkR15.0EJYYwPeGBwSul", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feedproxy.google.com/TechCrunch", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TechCrunch", "title": "The new age of ICOs is here, and it\u2019s not based on Ethereum", "title_full": "The new age of ICOs is here, and it\u2019s not based on Ethereum", "published": "2017-10-04T01:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/bitcoin-securities-ico.png", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1228, "comments": 25, "shares": 1228}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1083}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "00591b773c2074b4c6f39a3e3eacd58f39552300", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.mohjG2dubZJ9aHfDlgQjUJ5Eu9r2v743.oWfsnOgYvFRcnx5DNfyUgpQB4JLPBSwQegkR15.0EJYYwPeGBwSul", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mohit Mamoria", "published": "2017-10-04T01:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The new age of ICOs is here, and it\u2019s not based on Ethereum", "text": "The new age of ICOs is here, and it\u2019s not based on Ethereum Posted Former Intel CEO Paul Otellini passes away Mohit Mamoria Contributor Mohit Mamoria is a co-founder and CEO of GOD Token , which manages a hedge fund that invests exclusively in blockchain-based assets. More posts by this contributor: From barter to blockchain: A history of money ICOs are said to be the new way to raise money. We\u2019ve seen companies raising $100 million , $156 million , $185 million and even $232 million by selling tokens that will be used in the protocol that these companies have promised to build using this money. Against the money raised, the tokens they gave were created and sold on the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 meaning that all the trade that took place happened on the Ethereum blockchain and the tokens created are tracked on the Ethereum blockchain. But that is changing. Smart contracts Ethereum\u2019s mission of making blockchain more than a calculator has allowed them to invent the concept of smart contracts . You can think of smart contracts as a set of rules governing something, which cannot be modified ever in the future. They allow a developer to write anything in the form of a smart contract that gets executed by the network. Consider the example: If A and B place a bet about the next day\u2019s weather, the bet can be carried out in a trustless manner using a smart contract. Both of them can submit their betting amounts to the smart contract. At a predefined time on the next day, the contract will make an API call to the Open Weather API to see if the weather is sunny or rainy. Depending on the weather, the total amount will be sent to either of the two. Because this contract is no more than a software program and gets executed on a stranger\u2019s computer, it had to be made sure that the programmer cannot exploit the stranger\u2019s computer or the whole network. To fix the problem, Ethereum came up with its native programming language \u2014 Solidity. Although the language is Turing-complete, which means any program can be written in it, there\u2019s still a steep learning curve \u2014 and the developer community is in its infancy. These two limitations have made Ethereum be perceived as merely an ICO platform, rather than a world computer. Besides these Ethereum-specific disadvantages, it also faces the problems of the blockchain in general \u2014 slow speed and no native identity on the blockchain. But blockchains are evolving \u2014 we are living in the first few years when the internet was invented. It\u2019s slow, expensive, clunky; but hey, it\u2019s the future! Is the future anywhere near? As a huge advocate of blockchain in general, I am quite excited by the research and development happening in the space. With recent developments, we are seeing new blockchains coming up in the industry that offer so much more: They make developers move to using these newer blockchains for building their decentralized apps and ICOs. I am particularly excited by development in the blockchains that allow general computations to happen in a decentralized manner. The newer generation of such blockchains offers much more than the ability to write smart contracts. Support for programming language When it comes to writing a smart contract, the biggest obstacle that I hear from the Ethereum developer community is the requirement to learn a new programming language. I agree that the syntax looks very similar to JavaScript, but it still is a different language and requires you to think of a problem with a different mindset. Tezos blockchain decided to go with a functional programming language for the smart contracts. Most developers are alien to functional programming and might find the learning curve steeper than Ethereum\u2019s Solidity. Another blockchain, NEO , promises to offer support for .Net and Java to begin with, and eventually will allow programs written in Python and Go on its platform. With these four languages supported by NEO, it will already serve about 90 percent of the developer community from the get-go. Qtum is another blockchain that allows developers to write Ethereum-like smart contracts, but using Bitcoin\u2019s UTXO format. In bitcoin, there\u2019s no concept of an account and balance. Instead of tracking every account\u2019s balance, the unspent transactions are tracked (the transactions that were sent to your wallet and are not spent yet). The sum of those transactions make up your balance. It is very efficient and lightweight to maintain these records as compared to accounts on an Ethereum-based model. Qtum thus allows for very lightweight smart contracts. It\u2019s interesting to see how different blockchains are adopting various programming paradigms for their blockchains. Some are targeted toward consumers and some toward large enterprises. Native blockchain identity On the Ethereum blockchain, your identity is the public key whose private key you own. Every smart contract you deploy gets its own public address (identity). Unlike the pseudonymous model of Ethereum, blockchains like NEO offer users a native identity that can be used across the apps on the blockchain. Imagine if the internet had allowed every user to have a native identity, then you\u2019d have never been required to create a separate one for every service you use on the internet. Some say blockchain is the new internet . There are several mental models in which to fit blockchain, and I, too, believe considering it as the new internet is not a bad analogy. A native identity on the blockchain will have a native identity that can be used to access anything that gets built on the blockchain. There are several teams working to solve the identity problem on blockchains. For instance, on Ethereum, Civic allows a user to record his/her identity that he/she can later use for other apps on the blockchain. I find blockchain-level native identity a worthy proposition because if there\u2019s no native identity, the teams that are solving the identity problem will make the ecosystem fragmented. Consensus protocol The current generation of blockchains gets criticized for how much energy it consumes to power the network. The costs are high because of the consensus method Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain uses. In any blockchain, periodically all the nodes in the network will have to agree to the updated state of the system. Because the nodes are geographically distributed and are not always keeping track of every other node in the network, they would be required to sync themselves and agree upon the new state of the network. Currently, the most popular consensus method is proof of work, where every node tries to claim the updated state of the network by solving a cryptographic puzzle. Whoever solves it first gets to tell the network what the updated state is. Everyone agrees to it and proceeds ahead. The disadvantages of this method are that it is slow and expensive. There are several solutions to this problem, with their own pros and cons. While Ethereum is on its way to move consensus to proof of stake, Qtum and Tezos launched with a version of a proof of stake consensus protocol from the start. Interesting is that Tezos goes a step ahead and offers a decentralized way of governance to adopt any major upgrades to the protocol. Every major upgrade is proposed and voted upon, making the hard forks theoretically rare. On the other hand, NEO uses a delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) consensus mechanism that makes it possible to sync up the network a lot quicker without spending a lot of energy. It supports up to 10,000 transactions per second as compared to Ethereum\u2019s 15 transactions per second. Blockchain is the future \u2014 but how does the future look? Google wasn\u2019t the first search engine, and Facebook wasn\u2019t the first social network \u2014 they were the best ones. We might see a similar trend when it comes to the blockchain world. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown us something that we considered impossible before. But they are far from being perfect. While blockchain is the future, I do not believe the future is what we are living today. We are living among the experiments. What we see around us might be in ruins tomorrow. What we get as our future might not have been invented yet. With hopes still high and a sharp eye on the industry, I am waiting for the ultimate blockchain. Will it be Ethereum? Or NEO? Or Qtum? Or Tezos? Or something else? I don\u2019t know. For now, I am excited to witness one of the largest shifts a human life can live through. Even if the future does not appear to be near, the future is not far either.

These are like Apple\u2019s AirPods, requiring no wire to connect them, and they connect via Bluetooth to any device. The charging pod they ship with even has a similar design to the AirPod case, and carries three backup charges for powering up on the go. \nThe NuForce Free8 carries up to four hours of use in the batteries built into the buds, and they come with a range of silicon tips to fit different ear canal shapes. They fit snugly in my own ear, and I was able to use them comfortably both when walking, and when running and working out, without any fear of them falling out. \nWhile they don\u2019t feel like super premium devices (the plastic used doesn\u2019t feel nearly as premium as that used in competing products, including the Bragi line and Apple\u2019s own AirPods) they have withstood a lot of high intensity use, including wear in light rain and a lot of sweat testing. Their durability seems proven, and I\u2019ve had a few weeks with them to identify any problem spots. \nThe other area where wireless earbuds tend to fall down is in connectivity \u2013 Bluetooth headsets are one thing, but totally wireless buds have two connectivity challenges to deal with. The NuForce Free8 performed well here, too, with very few dropouts during normal use. The one caveat here is that I did very occasionally have audio interruptions when my phone was in my right pocket front pants pocket, since they maintain their Bluetooth connection with your smartphone from the left earbud. These dropouts were very few and far between, however, and even the small number that did occur were easily remedied just by switching the pocket where I keep my phone. \nSound quality is also good. You\u2019ll hear a bit of low-level background hum during the most quiet parts, but it\u2019s hard to pick up, and the audio quality when music and podcasts are playing sound great, with good bass levels and excellent sound reproduction that sounds balanced overall. Sound isolation is also effective, providing a good seal in my experience for passively blocking out the surrounding street noise. \nWhen compared to most totally wireless buds out there, the Free8 is definitely towards the top of the group. It\u2019s still an area where there\u2019s room for improvement vs. wired buds, but these will definitely meet the needs of most users when it comes to sound reproduction, for both podcasts and music or video watching. \nThe case they ship with, in addition to holding backup charges for the headphones, also has indicator lights on the front for telling you when the buds are charging and when they\u2019re charged up, which is a nice touch when compared to the AirPods case from Apple. It also includes a micro USB port for charging, which is not great for longevity \u2013 only accessories have micro USB now, with just above every Android smartphone maker having moved to USB C other latest devices. \nThe NuForce BE Free8\u2019s biggest strength might be their $149 asking price, however, which is under that of many of its competitors .

A standard USB drive is quickly replaced by another, larger one while home network file servers fall by the wayside as they get full, old, and dangerously lossy. In short, it\u2019s time for the big guns. \nThat\u2019s why I was pleased to try out the Netgear ReadyNAS 524X, part of Netgear\u2019s new network attached storage series aimed at small businesses and home users. The diskless version costs about $800 and can hold up to 40TB. \nThis NAS is essentially a small computer. It can run apps including tools for BitTorrent downloads and remote backups and it uses XRAID to ensure hot-swapability on each drive. This feature, enabled by RAID6, allows for the catastrophic failure of up to two of the drives but causes a deep hit in storage capacity. This also means you can literally pull a disk out of this thing randomly and have the entire setup still run. If you want to know your real-world sizing with RAID6 enabled this calculator can help. I tested the performance by pulling two disks and everything worked perfectly although the reindexing process lasted over 24 hours each time the device was hit. \nSetting up the drive is quite simple. To add a drive you simply pull out a carriage and snap the drive into place without tools. When you boot up for the first time you can begin a formatting process that brings all the drives online simultaneously. Then, when you need to swap one out, you can shut down the system manually and replace the drive offline. All you have to do is connect an Ethernet cable \u2013 this doesn\u2019t support Wi-Fi, and fire it up. \nOnce the NAS is up and running the system appears as a Windows and MacOS share. The drive can also support DLNA and UPnP and you can even SSH into the box where you\u2019ll find a standard Debian installation. This also means you can run cron jobs and even side load apps, a feature quite useful if you want to manage files with a little more granularity. Further, the NAS supports ReadyCloud, Netgear\u2019s own remote access protocol that lets you see files remotely. Further, you can connect the drive to Amazon S3, Google Drive, and Dropbox and sync folders back and forth. This makes it perfect for backing up live projects and maintaining a record of your remote files. \nHome users will be happy with the Plex support \u2013 Plex will scan any folder on the drive and serve it up piping hot to your TV \u2013 along with BitTorrent and NZB clients which are useful, obviously, for downloading public domain video from public servers. \nFinally if you stuff a load of music on here you\u2019ll also be able to access iTunes shares by clicking a button in the admin system. In short, this thing does it all. Latest Crunch Report \nWatch More Episodes \nIf you dig deeper in the ReadyNAS app store you\u2019ll find a number of useful tools including a solution for recording surveillance video as well as systems for managing syncing across servers. The app store, in fact, is the coolest part of this NAS, turning it from a simple storage server into something immensely useful. \nFor example, you can install Drupal, an HTML5 based SSH terminal, and a Docker management tool right from the main admin screen. Many of the tools are fairly functional and aimed mostly at programmers who want to simulate remote storage conditions in their non-production code. \nBecause this NAS runs a Intel D1508 Dual Core 2.2GHz processor with 4GB of memory I haven\u2019t yet been able to max this thing out although Netgear recommends a maximum of 80 users. I personally tried many of the streaming apps and found them to be far more efficient than anything I\u2019ve used before, including a Plex server running on a 2014 iMac. Because this is essentially a Debian server it\u2019s quite capable and quite compact. \nIn terms of performance this kit is obviously as good as your LAN network but I did a bit of testing using my home network and saw nothing untoward. If you\u2019re looking for solid benchmarks StorageReview posted a nice rundown but I\u2019ll show you what I found. \nI used a tool called Helios LanTest to read and write files to the drive. \nThe results showed real-world performance in my home network and modeling the same tests on the device itself took far less time \u2013 a few seconds. An 8GB library of music took about an hour to transfer over that same network \u2013 on par with anything else I\u2019ve seen in the space. \nThe 524X is a beast. I\u2019m used to using smaller devices with single drives and adding this to my network opened up a whole new world of, well, data hoarding. It\u2019s a file server, a testbed, a media streamer, and more and it\u2019s also a Debian machine and a great way to back up your computers. While the price is a little high \u2013 about $800 for a diskless unit \u2013 you\u2019re essentially getting a mini-PC with some definite RAID6 smarts. While it might be overkill for folks with a few baby pictures to back up, it\u2019s definitely worth a look if you keep lots of stuff on lots of servers. You will have so much more room for activities.

The deal isn\u2019t finalized just yet, so it\u2019s not clear how much money the firms will invest in Uber. As TechCrunch previously reported, the amount could be between $8 billion and $10 billion . \n\u201cToday, after welcoming its new directors Ursula Burns and John Thain, the Board voted unanimously to move forward with the proposed investment by SoftBank and with governance changes that would strengthen its independence and ensure equality among all shareholders,\u201d the board said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cSoftBank\u2019s interest is an incredible vote of confidence in Uber\u2019s business and long-term potential, and we look forward to finalizing the investment in the coming weeks.\u201d \nLast week, Uber appointed Burns and Thain to the board , even though SoftBank reportedly wanted those seats. The board of directors also voted to remove super-voting rights from some shareholders, Axios reports . What the board of directors reportedly did not approve was making changes that would formally prevent former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick from regaining control of the company. However, the changes did reportedly reduce Kalanick\u2019s board power. \n\u201cToday the Board came together collaboratively and took a major step forward in Uber\u2019s journey to becoming a world class public company, Kalanick said in a statement. \u201cWe approved moving forward with the Softbank transaction and reached unanimous agreement on a new governance framework that will serve Uber well. Under Dara\u2019s leadership and with strong guidance from the Board, we should expect great things ahead for Uber.\u201d \nSoftBank has been making headlines in the tech industry as of late. After raising a $100 billion fund, it\u2019s invested in ride-hailing companies that rival Uber, and now Uber itself. \nWhile Uber, the board and Kalanick see this as a win, Uber investor Shervin Pishevar is not on board with the Board. In a statement, Pishevar said: \nBe careful what you wish for \u2026\u2026. \nThey may think they have won a battle today but rest assured they will lose the war. \nAfter today\u2019s Board decision, stripping early employees and others of the voting rights they bargained for , we are moving forward with a class action lawsuit. We have given full authority to our attorneys to pursue any and all legal actions across the globe to bring justice for those wronged by this action. \nThe board\u2019s action today was unfair and illegal and we will be relentless in rectifying this wrong. \nWe will hold these people accountable under the law. \nTodays action by the board was the culmination of a blatant bait and switch, essentially robbing loyal employees , including the more than 200 early founding Uber employees and advisors, of their hard earned shareholder rights worth billions in value. Today\u2019s action is a naked violation and repudiation of those rights. \nWe will not rest until the employees rights are fully vindicated.

But it turns out Ryan Gosling is. And his SNL bit obsessing over the font\u2019s frequent inappropriate use (particularly in the movie Avatar) has prompted Papyrus\u2019s creator, Chris Costello, to address the issue. \nSpeaking to CBS News , he explained that he woke up to an inbox full of people telling him that the font, which he made around the turn of the century, had been the subject of SNL\u2019s good-natured ribbing. \n\u201cI took a look at it and me and my wife were like cracking up,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can take this time to apologize to my brother and sister graphic designers\u2026 I\u2019m a graphic designer as well, I\u2019m an illustrator\u2026 I believe it\u2019s a well-designed font.\u201d \n\u201cIt ended up being a default font set on every computer since 2000,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo that\u2019s when I began to see it turn up everywhere: mortgage ads, construction logos. It was kind of out of control. It was not my intent to be used for everything \u2014 it\u2019s way overused.\u201d \nLike the creator of Comic Sans, Costello isn\u2019t to be blamed here. He made a solid font and people who don\u2019t know any better have, in their naivet\u00e9, adopted it unquestioningly. \nWhile everyone sees Papyrus (or its knockoff version, Parchment) on aromatherapy bars, Indian restaurants, bumper stickers and so on, the final word on misuse definitely goes to James Cameron\u2019s Avatar. \nI may not think about it every day like my friend Ryan, but it did bother me quite a bit at the time. Papyrus was indeed already overused in 2009, when the movie came out, and it would have been mocked regardless. Sure, they tweaked it a bit, but as Gosling points out: \u201cIT WASN\u2019T ENOUGH.\u201d \nBut what bugs me even more is that the movie already had an earlier poster with a cool bit of type on it. Look: \nNow, that\u2019s not the greatest title type of all time (that would be Alien or everything by Saul Bass), but it\u2019s pretty neat. Maybe it is some off-the shelf stencil font , but it looks good \u2014 all the letter cuts point the same direction, you have overlap between the letters that\u2019s very suited to their shapes, and so on. Why not keep it? Did James say to lose it and go with a lightly modified version of a font notorious for being used exactly in this way \u2014 as a boring default selected by the design-unconscious? \nMaybe we\u2019ll never know. Or more likely, it\u2019s already been talked to death and we should just drop it. Except that, as Ryan\u2019s therapist points out, there are sequels coming. If they use Papyrus too, this may become an obsession after all . 0 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ryan gosling", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "saul bass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gosling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james cameron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris costello", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cbs news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:42:16.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2b24632dc9b408306bbb6c1a9564caa389b9a77d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.lCFErv36YZJ.kBBrlU46cjqvYZlDshr9WNux28M7p6UdKieGCoNeNVgXrMF8V4MIevESmxkx4.mg--", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://zimbabwe-consolidated-news.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Zimbabwe Consolidated News", "title": "Former Intel CEO Paul Otellini passes away", "title_full": "Former Intel CEO Paul Otellini passes away", "published": "2017-10-04T00:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://zimbabwe-consolidated-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gettyimages-136706320.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 536, "comments": 0, "shares": 536}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 17}, "linkedin": {"shares": 123}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b24632dc9b408306bbb6c1a9564caa389b9a77d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.lCFErv36YZJ.kBBrlU46cjqvYZlDshr9WNux28M7p6UdKieGCoNeNVgXrMF8V4MIevESmxkx4.mg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "reshared_by_ZCN", "published": "2017-10-04T00:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Former Intel CEO Paul Otellini passes away", "text": "Former Intel CEO Paul Otellini passes away By This post was originally published here http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/gettyimages-136706320.jpg \nPaul Otellini, who presided over Intel during some of its most prosperous years, passed away today at the age of 66.

In a letter, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden \u2014 an outspoken member of the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 called on six of the main voting machine manufacturers in the U.S. to provide details about their cybersecurity efforts to date. The request comes on the heels of emerging details around Russia\u2019s successful attempts to hack election systems in many states . \nWyden\u2019s line of inquiry is grounded in the pursuit of details, like if a company has been breached previously without reporting the incident and how often it has conducted penetration testing in cooperation with an external security firm. \nWyden\u2019s full list of questions are as follows: \n1. Does your company employ a Chief Information Security Officer? If yes, to whom do they directly report? If not, why not? 2. How many employees work solely on corporate or product information security? 3. In the last five years, how many times has your company utilized an outside cybersecurity firm to audit the security of your products and conduct penetration tests of your corporate information technology infrastructure? 4. Has your company addressed all of the issues discovered by these cybersecurity experts and implemented all of their recommendations? If not, why not? 5. Do you have a process in place to receive and respond to unsolicited vulnerability reports from cybersecurity researchers and other third parties? How many times in the past five years has your company received such reports? 6. Are you aware of any data breaches or other cybersecurity incidents in which an attacker gained unauthorized access to your internal systems, corporate data or customer data? If your company has suffered one or more data breaches or other cybersecurity incidents, have you reported these incidents to federal, state and local authorities? If not, why not? 7. Has your company implemented the best practices described in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 2015 Voluntary Voting Systems Guidelines 1.1? If not, why not? 8. Has your firm implemented the best practices described in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.0? If not, why not? \nWyden\u2019s appeal to voting machine manufacturers is the latest piece in the ongoing conversation around election system and voting machine security following revelations from the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Because states handle elections in a variety of ways, implementing different styles of machine and overseeing their own voter rolls, just how airtight these systems are is difficult to assess. \nFor example, last month the state of Virginia decertified some of its machines , moving its statewide standard to more secure voting machines that keep a paper tally of votes \u2014 a step the state\u2019s board of elections undertook on its own. In January , the Department of Homeland Security added \u201cstorage facilities, polling places, and centralized vote tabulations locations\u201d in addition to voter databases and voting machines to a national list of critical infrastructure, making it easier for states to expedite requests for federal cybersecurity aid for their election systems. \nComing at election security from the manufacturer angle offers an examination of one of the most germane pieces of the big picture. In his letter, Wyden demanded answers to the above questions from Dominion Voting, Election Systems & Software, Five Cedars Group, Hart InterCivic, MicroVote and Unisyn Voting Solutions, as well as voting system test labs V&V and SLI Compliance, issuing them an October 31 deadline. \n\u201cAs our election systems have come under unprecedented scrutiny, public faith in the security of our electoral process at every level is more important than ever before,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cEnsuring that Americans can trust that election systems and infrastructure are secure is necessary to protecting confidence in our electoral process and democratic government.\u201d Featured Image: New America / Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE (IMAGE HAS BEEN MODIFIED) 0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ron wyden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hart intercivic", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate intelligence committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "softbank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institute of standards and technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of homeland security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominion voting", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "election systems & software, five cedars group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unisyn voting solutions", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T02:30:53.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d8fe37744a70840bf59668b0f0dde503625eda91", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kIkVuP7e9mqAbSS_cnWS_RcqC5BLBb5dtX7vHCMmueGn6q4Je8.bseoqJVKgelOatT01GRCkHnNOwUdTAyteKOmF3BQgR5FQU-", "site_full": "techcrunch.com", "site": "techcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TechCrunch", "title": "Mozilla funds open source projects with half a million in grants", "title_full": "Mozilla funds open source projects with half a million in grants", "published": "2017-10-04T02:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/mozilla-1.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 697, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 94, "comments": 2, "shares": 94}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 255}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d8fe37744a70840bf59668b0f0dde503625eda91", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2zRe1PZr6bfCm.0GE0o3YaaL6rZbDv.kIkVuP7e9mqAbSS_cnWS_RcqC5BLBb5dtX7vHCMmueGn6q4Je8.bseoqJVKgelOatT01GRCkHnNOwUdTAyteKOmF3BQgR5FQU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Devin Coldewey", "published": "2017-10-04T02:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mozilla funds open source projects with half a million in grants", "text": "Mozilla funds open source projects with half a million in grants Posted Senator calls on voting machine makers to detail how they\u2019ll prevent hacks Mozilla has announced the latest recipients of its Open Source Support grants, totaling $539,000.

Webpack, a JavaScript module loader that\u2019s part of the cross-browser WebAssembly format, got $125K. Phaser, an HTML5-based game engine, got $50K, and mod_md, part of a system designed to make HTTPS deployment easier, took home $70K. \nThe next phase of Mozilla\u2019s Open Source Support plan is to focus on individual regions \u2014 starting with India.
