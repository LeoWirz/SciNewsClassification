More than 200 inReach users sent us a message from their device at the location where they viewed the eclipse.\nMany inReach eclipse viewers shared that they were in the path of totality, and others noted that the weather prevented good conditions for watching. Regardless of the location, the messages expressed the inReach community\u2019s enthusiasm for witnessing the eclipse in their residential neighborhoods, work sites and remote backcountry locations.\nVisit the link here to view a detailed map online, which shares not only the location but also the text of each message we received. (We removed information that could identify a user.) The image below shows the location of the messages we received along with a line that indicates the approximate path of totality.\n\nA number of inReach users shared that they were gathering with friends, families and strangers to view the eclipse. One inReach user, Ken from Colorado, shared that he camped with about 150 people southwest of Lingle, Wyoming. He provided the following description:\n\u201c We sat around in our camp chairs watching the progression of the moon\u2019s disk over the morning sun in clear, high-elevation skies. As the moon shadow swept over the western ridges, it looked like an approaching storm. Totality was 2m 11s that seemed much shorter, but the cries of joy from adults matched those of the kids. You can\u2019t describe the moment with words or pictures; the experience was chilling (literally, as we had a thermometer set up that measured a 20\u00b0F drop). \u201d\nAnother favorite message came from an inReach user in northeastern Oregon, \u201c John Day Wilderness in a hammock with welding hoods on and not a single person around.

Every day there is at least one inReach-related SOS incident and rescue somewhere in the world.\nThe Story of the 2,000 th inReach Rescue \nDan is an experienced and well-trained outdoorsman. He often ventures with his wife from their home in Colorado to explore the western United States. In August Dan and his wife were backpacking in the Platte River Wilderness in Wyoming when things took a turn for the worse.\n\nThey had set up camp by Douglas Creek. The area was very remote, and they were three days into their hike. Around 8 p.m., Dan became very ill. He felt extremely cold and couldn\u2019t move. His wife moved their tent near him, and he managed to get inside and crawl into a sleeping bag.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be rescued,\u201d said Dan. \u201cIt was always a point of pride. I had been doing this a long time and had never been rescued.\u201d However, they soon realized that his condition was serious, and Dan\u2019s wife decided to trigger an SOS on the inReach.\nDan was typically the one who used the inReach device for navigation and sending messages to friends and family during their adventures. His wife was less familiar with the device, but she read the SOS instructions on the back of the inReach SE and began communicating with staff at the GEOS International Emergency Response Coordination Center (IERCC).\n\u201cThe good thing about the Garmin inReach is the texting capability,\u201d Dan said. \u201cWe were able to be specific about my symptoms.\u201d Staff at the IERCC were in contact with area emergency services, and IERCC staff soon sent a message that a helicopter was en route and provided instructions on how to help the helicopter crew identify their location.\nThe Platte River Wilderness has significant tree cover; however, Dan and his wife happened to find a meadow to camp in that night, which provided a good landing spot for the rescue crew\u2019s helicopter. Dan was transported to a hospital in Cheyenne, but because of their elevation and the helicopter\u2019s weight requirements, his wife could not travel with him.\nDan\u2019s wife sent messages to their son via the inReach device to explain the situation. The local Sheriff\u2019s office offered to send deputies in that night to help her hike out. Instead, she decided to wait until daylight and hiked five miles back to the trailhead on her own, using the route Dan had created before their trip on the inReach SE device. A few days later, their son used the coordinates from the inReach device messages he had received from his mother to return to the location of the incident and recover his parents\u2019 gear.\nDan found out later at the hospital that he had had a stroke. \u201cThe inReach saved my life. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have made it through the night.\u201d \n\nExploring and Communicating with inReach Around the World \nIn November 2011, the first inReach device was launched. It was equipped with a button that \u2014 when triggered \u2014 would send a distress message to GEOS, provide message delivery confirmation and enable the user to maintain a two-way text conversation with a professional emergency monitoring center. For the first time, an adventurer in the backcountry, an aviator in a remote area or a sailor crossing the sea could afford to have the technology at hand and the peace of mind to know that if something went wrong, a personal SOS message could be sent and help would soon be on the way.\nMany of the 2,000 inReach SOS incidents are for emergencies involving the user, but there are numerous instances where the inReach subscriber has triggered an SOS to request resources to help a stranger, a friend or a family member. In fact, many rescues, requests for assistance, and messages of wants and needs happen without triggering an SOS. Being able to send a two-way message and self-rescue, ask for help, or find your way home makes the inReach experience different. Since its launch, more than 85 million points of data message traffic has been sent via an inReach device from land, sea and air and every corner of the globe.\nDan is recuperating and doing well. He still has a desire to go out and explore. \u201cI want to walk the Camino de Santiago in Spain. I\u2019d like to be able to travel. I may do some canyon exploring again in southern Utah. My main goal is to get back to do things.\u201d \nThe post inReach: More than 2,000 Rescues Worldwide appeared first on Garmin Blog .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas creek", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "iercc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geos international emergency response coordination center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "himalayas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bolivia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nepal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cheyenne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santiago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "platte river wilderness", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyoming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T02:20:55.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df13d7dfb846e52d92aa5731fc94cd91059faf6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJVMyu4VFtv4atZz9TQ9b0y_fpjnvVyQPTM9AynYiGe0DLDfN0lBRNdCy8.BZEOgseVEtQ8nQC29ILvv9XI5WcAWbUdpUwT.C9dV5nxi.WV6qWZqQSgEiJcmx3dU2Apf1SlptCn9yArFFBGMFDuPjnpnEsoTgodCD4Ao.YpbLH_A--", "site_full": "www.garmin.com", "site": "garmin.com", "site_section": "https://www.garmin.com/en-US/blog", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Aviation \u2013 Garmin Blog", "title": "Flight Displays and Engine Monitoring Solutions Reimagined with G500 TXi, G600 TXi, G700 TXi and EIS TXi", "title_full": "Flight Displays and Engine Monitoring Solutions Reimagined with G500 TXi, G600 TXi, G700 TXi and EIS TXi", "published": "2017-10-04T17:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 29, "comments": 0, "shares": 29}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 52}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "df13d7dfb846e52d92aa5731fc94cd91059faf6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJVMyu4VFtv4atZz9TQ9b0y_fpjnvVyQPTM9AynYiGe0DLDfN0lBRNdCy8.BZEOgseVEtQ8nQC29ILvv9XI5WcAWbUdpUwT.C9dV5nxi.WV6qWZqQSgEiJcmx3dU2Apf1SlptCn9yArFFBGMFDuPjnpnEsoTgodCD4Ao.YpbLH_A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dan Camacho", "published": "2017-10-04T17:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Flight Displays and Engine Monitoring Solutions Reimagined with G500 TXi, G600 TXi, G700 TXi and EIS TXi", "text": "We\u2019re excited to announce the touchscreen G500 TXi , G600 TXi and G700 TXi flight displays, as well as the engine information system (EIS) TXi. Boasting a clean-sheet touchscreen design and vibrant presentation, the TXi family incorporates greater situational awareness tools and an innovative feature set into a contemporary avionics platform. Three displays are available, offering optimal flexibility for panel configurations, including a large 10.6-inch display, and two versions of 7-inch displays, in portrait and landscape orientations. The 10.6-inch display can operate as a primary flight display (PFD), multi-function display (MFD) and optional integrated EIS in a highly customized package, while the 7-inch portrait display can be dedicated to any one of those functions. The 7-inch landscape display is available exclusively as a dedicated EIS solution. The G500 TXi system is intended for Part 23 Class I/II aircraft under 6,000 lbs. and the G600 TXi flight displays are intended for Class III aircraft that weigh up to 12,500 lbs. The G700 TXi is exclusively for Part 23 Class IV and Part 25 aircraft that weigh greater than 12,500 lbs. Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) for the G500 TXi/G600 TXi and EIS TXi systems are targeted for approval in Q4 2017, which will feature a comprehensive approved model list (AML) containing over 600 single-engine piston, twin-engine piston and turboprop aircraft makes and models, offering the most configurable, state-of-the-art glass flight display solution in the market.\n7-inch portrait G500 TXi.\nVibrant, state-of-the-art touchscreen display \nThe TXi family incorporates a familiar touchscreen design with modern processors that support improved map and chart rendering, faster panning and contemporary single-finger zoom and pinch-to-zoom gestures. Through any combination of the touchscreen or dual concentric knobs, pilots can quickly access and view flight information at a glance. Modernized displays and large fonts offer improved readability, while the simplistic user-interface helps reduce overall pilot workload. Pilots will also appreciate a familiar in-flight experience behind the TXi series as the user interface is harmonious with multiple Garmin products, such as the GTN 650/750 touchscreen navigators.\nGreater scalability, building block design and simplified upgrades \nMultiple panel configurations and display orientations allow pilots and aircraft owners to better leverage their current or future avionics investment. Three display formats support 26-approved cockpit configurations and over 600 aircraft makes/models. Installation configurations vary as the TXi family is also capable of displaying engine information on a dedicated 7-inch display or in split-screen mode on the 10.6-inch display. Up to four displays can be installed in a single cockpit, offering superior scalability in hundreds of aircraft.\nContributing to a streamlined installation and simplified maintenance, the TXi displays are available with integrated attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) and a display-mounted air data computer (ADC), typically alleviating the need to separately locate, mount and wire these sensors. As an additional option for remote mounting, a combined air data and attitude heading reference system (ADAHRS) is available or AHRS and ADC are available separately. Installation is further minimized for aircraft with an existing G500/G600 as the TXi series are compatible with previously installed Garmin sensors. The TXi family will also interface with the new GFC 600 autopilot and is compatible with a wide range of additional third-party autopilots available on the market.\nIndustry-first touchscreen EIS solutions \nAvailable as an integrated solution within the 10.6-inch G500 TXi and G600 TXi system or as a standalone 7-inch EIS display, the TXi series display real-time engine indications in an easy-to-read format. The TXi family supports various features, including lean assist mode, pilot-configurable advisories and more, providing pilots with the opportunity to achieve greater fuel economy, improved engine efficiency and superior engine operation. Compatible with single-engine and twin-engine normally aspirated or turbo-charged aircraft, the EIS TXi system supports Lycoming or Continental 4/6-cylinder engines, offering a broad range of aircraft compatibility. The integrated EIS TXi solution also allows for a variety of integration possibilities with the G500 TXi and G600 TXi glass flight displays.\nWhen the EIS TXi system is paired with a GTN 650/750 and Flight Stream 510, Connext automatically downloads engine and other flight information to the Garmin Pilot app on an Apple mobile device, which is then synced to flyGarmin.com. The flyGarmin website allows pilots to view information such as track logs, cylinder head temperatures (CHT), exhaust gas temperatures (EGT), oil temperatures and more. Pilots can also view flight parameters such as altitude and airspeed alongside an interactive moving map on the website. In addition to wireless engine and flight data downloads to Garmin Pilot, data can also be logged and stored on an SD card within EIS TXi.\nGarmin EIS TXi.\nConnext wireless connectivity \nWhen the TXi series is paired with a GTN 650/750 touchscreen navigator, Connext wireless connectivity offers additional capabilities. Flight Stream 510 is an option with the GTN 650/750, which enables Database Concierge, the wireless transfer of aviation databases from the Garmin Pilot app on a mobile device to a GTN and the TXi system. Flight Stream 510 also supports the sharing of a breadth of information with compatible mobile devices running Garmin Pilot or ForeFlight Mobile, including two-way flight plan transfer, traffic, weather, GPS information and back-up attitude information as available.\nBest in class reversionary mode \u2013 say goodbye to standbys \nIn configurations where multiple displays are installed, the TXi series offer reversionary mode as a single system is capable of displaying all pertinent flight information, including EIS when installed. Additionally, the 7-inch TXi displays are compatible with an optional back-up battery, which can power the display for 30-minutes in the event the aircraft electrical system fails. Aircraft owners that install a dual 7-inch G500 TXi system on the pilot\u2019s side of the cockpit, with dual ADAHRS and a back-up battery can also forego the requirement for standby flight instruments.\nNext generation HSI adds mapping \nThe TXi family boasts a geographical map overlay within the horizontal situation indicator (HSI) on the PFD, which also supports the overlay of NEXRAD, Flight Information Service-Broadcast (FIS-B) weather, SafeTaxi airport diagrams, traffic, terrain and more. For example, pilots can overlay terrain within the HSI map, while simultaneously viewing traffic and flight plan information without significantly diverting their attention away from the PFD. It is also easy to navigate within the HSI map as pilots can simply zoom in/out on the map using a single finger gesture.\nFully loaded functionality \nThe G500 TXi and G600 TXi also support additional features and options:\nCustomizable crew profiles allow pilots to configure and save settings such as audio volume levels, backlight settings, map configurations and more so they can be recalled prior to each flight. Pilots can overlay and animate NEXRAD radar from FIS-B and SiriusXM Aviation weather on the moving map on the MFD. Various global datalink weather products are available when paired with the GSR 56. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) In traffic and FIS-B weather display on the PFD/MFD via the GTX 345 transponder or GDL 88 ADS-B datalink. GWX 70 weather radar compatibility offers four-color storm cell display, as well as Turbulence Detection and Ground Clutter Suppression as options. Support for a wide range of third-party weather radars is also available. Pilots are offered significant savings on database subscriptions as OnePak annual database and PilotPak global database subscriptions are compatible with these displays. Smart Airspace highlights the airspace nearest the aircraft\u2019s current altitude and de-emphasizes non-pertinent airspace. Pilots can view and alternate between Garmin FliteCharts \u00ae or optional Jeppesen charts. Jeppesen VFR Manual charts (formally known as Bottlang charts) are available within Europe and European Visual Reporting Points (VRPs) can be overlaid on the moving map. WireAware\u2122 wire strike avoidance technology overlays powerline locations and relative altitude information on the moving map and provides both aural and visual alerting when operating near powerlines. Synthetic Vision Technology (SVT) is standard on the G600 TXi and presents a 3D depiction of terrain, obstacles, traffic and the runway environment, providing pilots with an elevated level of situational awareness. SVT is available as an option on the G500 TXi. Class B Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) alerting is available as an option. Compatibility extended to include the GTS 800/825 Traffic Advisory Systems (TAS) and the GTS 855 Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), as well as select third-party traffic systems. Patented TargetTrend\u2122 and TerminalTraffic\u2122 is available with select traffic systems and provides pilots with a more intuitive method of judging target trajectories and closure rates. Compatible with the GRA 55 radar altimeter, as well as select third-party radar altimeters. Optional support for Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) operations. An optional dedicated PFD controller provides pilots with an additional source to make adjustments to the heading bug, barometric setting, altitude bug and more. A back-up GPS antenna is also built into the displays, providing redundancy in the event a primary GPS navigator fails. The G500 TXi and G600 TXi touchscreen flight displays and EIS TXi are targeted for approval in Q4 2017 via a comprehensive AML that contains over 600 aircraft makes and models. Pricing for the TXi series is as follows:\nG500 TXi\n7-inch display: starting at $11,995 10.6-inch display: starting at $15,995 Addition of EIS to a G500 TXi flight display starting at $4,995 G600 TXi\n7-inch display: starting at $18,995 10.6-inch display: starting at $24,995 Standalone EIS TXi (twin-engine, six-cylinder piston aircraft such as a 58 Baron)\nStarting at $17,935 System variants that come with new sensors and variants that support existing G500/G600 sensors are also available. Pricing and availability of the G700 TXi touchscreen flight displays for Part 25 aircraft will be announced at a later date.

The G1000 NXi offers modern displays that boast significant performance improvements alongside a comprehensive feature set that incorporates wireless cockpit connectivity, split-screen capability, SurfaceWatch, visual approaches, map overlay on the horizontal situation indicator (HSI) and more. The Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) for the G1000 NXi integrated flight deck upgrade in the Citation Mustang is targeted for approval in the second half of 2018 and will be available from Textron Aviation Service Centers.\n\u201cThis announcement is very special to me because in March 2003, the Citation Mustang was the first-ever announced program to adopt the G1000 integrated flight deck and today, we\u2019re excited to offer the G1000 NXi integrated flight deck upgrade to over 470 of these aircraft,\u201d said Carl Wolf, vice president of aviation marketing and sales. \u201cThat announcement with Cessna in 2003 publicly launched the Integrated Flight Deck business for Garmin, for which we are forever grateful. Since that time, there are now 65 aircraft models certified with Garmin Integrated Flight Deck systems from 26 different aircraft manufacturers.\u201d\nA robust feature set accompanies the G1000 NXi integrated flight deck upgrade for the Mustang. Aiding in situational awareness, SurfaceWatch runway monitoring technology provides visual and aural cues to help prevent pilots from taking off or landing on a taxiway, on a runway that is too short or on the wrong runway based on performance data entered during preflight. Visual and audible runway distance remaining annunciations are also available via SurfaceWatch. Additionally, visual approaches integrated within the G1000 NXi system offer pilots enhanced guidance in visual flight conditions based on a three- degree glideslope from the threshold of the runway. Pilots can select the runway for which they have been cleared to land, set customized minimums, select vectors or straight-in for the final approach intercept and fly a visual approach coupled with the autopilot.\nGeographical map overlay within the HSI is available on the primary flight display (PFD), which also supports the display of NEXRAD, Flight Information Service-Broadcast (FIS-B) weather, weather radar, SafeTaxi airport diagrams, traffic, terrain and more. For example, pilots can display SafeTaxi on the HSI map while preparing flight plan information on the multi-function display (MFD).

Intended for business, commercial and military aircraft, the Doppler-based GWX 80 incorporates automatic 3D volumetric scanning, predictive wind shear detection, hail and lightning prediction, and advanced ground clutter suppression. A new, enhanced color palette also features more color contouring than any other weather radar on the market. The GWX 80 provides real-time weather information to help pilots analyze convective weather threats, which aids in situational awareness and helps reduce aircraft operational costs.\nThe GWX 80 has been selected by Textron Aviation for the new super-midsize Cessna Citation Longitude in conjunction with the G5000 integrated flight deck.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the GWX 80, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re excited to bring a virtually zero-effort weather radar to the cockpit of thousands of new and existing aircraft on the market today,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Carl Wolf, Garmin vice president of aviation sales and marketing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Equipped with automated 3D volumetric scanning, the GWX 80 goes beyond hail and lightning prediction to also display severe cells that may contain wind shear or turbulence. With these tools, pilots achieve greater situational awareness so they can more confidently navigate around severe weather threats and provide passengers with a better in-flight experience.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nAutomated weather radar with 3D volumetric scanning \nThe GWX 80 weather radar features advanced automation technology, which allows the pilot to more easily manage the weather radar while in-flight. The GWX 80 merges 3D volumetric scanning with advanced ground clutter suppression and automatically adjusts the tilt of the weather radar to create the most representative depiction of flight hazards near or along the flight path of the aircraft. Because tilt management is fully automated, the GWX 80 prevents pilots from over scanning or under scanning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c common errors when managing a weather radar in-flight. Pilots simply select the range of interest and the GWX 80 gathers multiple scans at various tilt angles to display a comprehensive, easier to interpret weather radar image. The GWX 80 offers a range of 320 nautical miles, horizontal scan angles of up to 120 degrees and to focus on an area of interest, pilot-adjustable sector scanning.\nPredictive wind shear identification \nWind shear detection provides pilots with an additional look into the storm by detecting a combination of updrafts and downdrafts and Doppler-effect that result in wind shear formation, which is fully automated throughout the take-off and landing phases of flight. Pilots receive aural wind shear notifications, as well as visual indications on a dedicated Garmin display using a standard format.\nTurbulence detection and hail/lightning prediction \nUtilizing the GWX 80, pilots can more confidently navigate around challenging weather with advanced features such as Doppler-enabled turbulence detection, as well as hail and lightning prediction, which allow for more precise weather interpretation. Turbulence detection helps pilots more easily identify turbulence in air that contains moisture or particulates, while WATCH\u00c2\u017d (Weather Attenuated Color Highlight) helps to identify shadowing effects of short-range cell activity and highlights areas where radar returns are weakened or attenuated by intense precipitation. Additionally, zero blind range aids in the identification of storm cells in close proximity to the aircraft. The GWX 80 also incorporates unique technology that detects certain atmospheric conditions that may lead to the formation of hail and lightning within a storm cell. The color-coded depiction of potential areas where hail and lightning may reside or develop within a storm is depicted out to an 80 nautical mile range, while turbulence is depicted out to a 40 nautical mile range.\nA high-definition color palette helps pilots more easily interpret the severity of an individual storm cell or multiple storm cells in an area, which incorporates four times more color gradients than typically found on other weather radars on the market. The GWX 80 is also among the lightest weather radar in its class at 13.9 lbs (6.3 kg) for the 14-inch version, providing additional savings in weight compared to other weather radar systems on the market.\nGarmin expects to receive Technical Standard Order (TSO) certification of the GWX 80 by the end of the year.

The GHD system incorporates modern optical design within a single display unit, projecting a crisp, clear view of pertinent flight information while also offering superior integration with Garmin integrated flight decks. Garmin will also feature a state-of-the- art, fully functional HUD at the Garmin exhibit (C12412) at the National Business Aviation Association Convention & Exhibition (NBAA-BACE) in Las Vegas, Nevada, October 10-12, 2017, which will allow customers to interact with and experience the GHD first-hand.\nThroughout flight testing in the Citation Longitude, the GHD continues to progress in its own development and evaluation. Numerous instrument approaches in a variety of flight environments have been conducted during recent flight evaluations. Additionally, Garmin has completed a comprehensive evaluation in its own human factors flight simulation lab.\nThe GHD is a compact, self-contained projection system with a large 30-degree by 24-degree field-of- view. Driven by the Garmin integrated flight deck, the GHD projects a familiar presentation of critical flight information, symbology and more. Given its small, compact form factor, the GHD can easily be incorporated into a variety of business aircraft cockpits while also maintaining comfortable head clearance. The GHD incorporates intelligent dimming that automatically adapts to ambient light, delivering supreme clarity and brightness in all lighting conditions.\nBecause the GHD is highly integrated with the Garmin flight deck, consistent symbology is utilized between both systems so pilots experience a near-seamless transition when flying with the primary flight display (PFD) or with the GHD. In addition to displaying flight-critical PFD information, the GHD displays conformal attitude and flight path information overtop the real-world view, alongside navigation data, flight plan information, autopilot modes, master warning/caution annunciations and more. The GHD also offers a simplistic control interface and offers similarities in tactile operation in relation to the Garmin integrated flight deck. \nGarmin GHD 2100 Head-up Display.\nThe Flight Path Marker within the GHD precisely displays where the aircraft is flying, taking into account crosswind, angle of attack and other factors that impact the dynamic position and heading of the aircraft. Coupled with a flight path-based flight director, the pilot can more easily establish desired aircraft flight path relative to the outside world. The Flight Path Marker includes additional features such as speed offset and velocity cue, allowing for precise energy management. The combination of the Flight Path Marker and flight path-based flight director allows pilots to more easily establish and maintain a stabilized approach to land.\nPilots are provided with an enhanced level of situational awareness with Synthetic Vision Technology (SVT), which presents a 3D depiction of terrain, traffic, obstacles, the runway environment and more within the GHD, supplementing the outside view with pertinent flight information. Also featured within the GHD, SurfaceWatchTM provides visual and aural cues to help prevent pilots from taking off and landing on a taxiway, on a runway that is too short or on the wrong runway based on performance data entered during preflight. For example, while on approach to land on a runway that is snow-covered or in an airport environment with reduced visibilities, SurfaceWatch highlights and outlines the pilot-selected runway on the GHD and on the PFD so it\u2019s easier to identify.\nThe GHD is positioned to further expand its present capabilities. Future options such as integrating with external cameras, including Enhanced Vision Systems (EVS), provide significant improvements in situational awareness in fog and other low visibility situations. Future capabilities also include integration with a Combined Vision System (CVS), which blends EVS and SVT images to present pertinent levels of detail to the pilot, particularly during approach and landing.\nThe GHD also allows the operator to pursue Special Authorization Category I (CAT I), as well as Special Authorization Category II (CAT II) Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach minima.\nPilots can experience the GHD at our exhibit (C12412) at NBAA-BACE this week. The fully-functional GHD will allow customers to view and interact with the HUD first-hand as it\u2019s flying a terrain-challenging instrument approach.

For more than a decade, the G1000 has modernized the King Air cockpit by providing operators with enhanced operational benefits and increased aircraft utility, while also offering significant weight savings and a lower cost of operation. Earlier this year, we began deliveries of the G1000 NXi for King Air aircraft, which carries on the lineage and success of the renowned G1000 integrated flight deck.\n\u201cAs one of the most successful avionics retrofits in this class of aircraft, we have seen G1000 installations in King Air aircraft of varying backgrounds \u2013 from fleet workhorses to individual operators,\u201d said Carl Wolf, Garmin vice president of aviation sales and marketing. \u201cWe would like to express our gratitude to not only our customers, but our talented and trusted dealer network who have helped us to achieve such a tremendous milestone. We look forward to growing the success of this program even further so thousands of owners and operators can continue to experience the benefits of the G1000 and G1000 NXi integrated flight deck in the King Air cockpit.\u201d\nThe milestone G1000 was installed by Elliott Aviation in Moline, Illinois in a King Air B200 operated by Keewatin Air, a long-time Garmin customer. Keewatin Air provides medevac and air ambulance services in remote areas of the rugged Canadian Arctic. This milestone upgrade marks Keewatin Air\u2019s ninth G1000 integrated flight deck upgrade within their fleet of King Air aircraft, with intentions to add more in the future.\nKing Air G1000 NXi featuring optional wireless database and flight plan transfer with Flight Stream 510.\n\u201cFor the past eight years, the Garmin G1000 retrofit program for King Air aircraft has played a major role in the success of Elliott Aviation. This program shines above all others because it replaces the entire avionics suite \u2013 not just parts of the system \u2013 and it literally zero-times the aircraft avionics with the latest technology and best-in-class Garmin customer support,\u201d said Mark Wilken, Elliott Aviation vice president of avionics programs and operational logistics. \u201cElliott Aviation viewed this program as a true winner from the beginning and we look to forward retrofitting many more King Air\u2019s with G1000 NXi for years to come.\u201d\n\u201cKeewatin Air operates an all-G1000 fleet \u2013 equipping seven aircraft in 2015 and two more in 2017 \u2013 which has allowed us to set the standard in air ambulance operations and ensure that our flight crews have the best systems available to them to help make every medevac a safe and successful mission,\u201d said D. Wayne McLeod, CEO/president of Keewatin Air. \u201cThis standardization has also resulted in significant maintenance cost savings in our operation.\u201d\nThis Garmin milestone comes 10 years after the company announced its initial retrofit program for the King Air, which has grown to include the King Air C90A/B, 200, B200, 300 and 350 series aircraft. Since its introduction, the G1000 integrated flight deck has revolutionized the King Air cockpit by incorporating key benefits, such as Synthetic Vision Technology (SVT), Electronic Stability and Protection (ESP), geo- referenced approach charts, datalink weather and more. With the G1000 upgrade, these aircraft also comply with global airspace modernization initiatives as they receive a fully integrated, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out solution, PBN/RNP and LPV/APV approach guidance. As a complete retrofit, the G1000 upgrade solves parts obsolescence among the King Air fleet with zero-time avionics and provides an estimated weight savings of 200 pounds or more compared to the current system, allowing additional baggage, passenger and fuel load flexibility.\nAnnounced in January 2017, the successor to the ever-popular G1000 integrated flight deck, the\nG1000 NXi, has continued to build upon its success. Boasting modernized flight displays, the G1000 NXi supports faster map rendering and smoother panning throughout the PFD and MFD. Features such as wireless cockpit connectivity \u2013 including wireless aviation database updates using Garmin Flight Stream, enhanced situational awareness with SurfaceWatchTM and more, are all available with the G1000 NXi. Modernized situational awareness tools such as geographical map overlay within the HSI and visual approaches add to the G1000 NXi feature set. Additionally, King Air owners and operators with an existing G1000 integrated flight deck can upgrade to the G1000 NXi with minimal aircraft down time and disruption to the panel as the displays preserve the same footprint and connector.\nFor additional information regarding the G1000 NXi upgrade for the King Air, visit our exhibit (C12412) at the National Business Aviation Association Convention & Exhibition (NBAA-BACE) in Las Vegas, Nevada, October 10-12, 2017 or contact Scott Frye at (913) 440-2412 or scott.frye@garmin.com.

Have you thought about what you are going to do after, or before, the big race? Kansas City has a lot more to offer than a great race location, and here are just a few scenes you should check out while you\u2019re here.\nLet\u2019s talk about barbecue. Instead of a Walgreens or Starbucks on every corner, Kansas City has barbecue joints. Visit KC claims that Kansas City is the barbecue capital of the world .\nWe\u2019re mostly famous for our slow-smoked meats, burnt ends, and sweet and tangy sauces. If that doesn\u2019t get your mouth watering after a tough race, I don\u2019t know what will. My guess is, you\u2019ll probably catch a whiff of the tantalizing smells as you run through this fine city.\nKansas City isn\u2019t called the Paris of the Plains for nothing. This is a place where you can experience culture, art, music and beauty, and all within 30 minutes of the city. There is so much history to take in while you\u2019re here. During the full marathon, you\u2019ll run right by Memorial Hill, home of the National World War I Museum and Memorial. You\u2019ll also be running through 18th & Vine, which is internationally recognized as one of the cradles of jazz music and a historic hub of African-American businesses. This area also features the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, a true Kansas City treasure.\nIf you\u2019re into the art scene, you won\u2019t be disappointed. Even the design of your race T-shirt was inspired by the famous Shuttlecocks art installation at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. You\u2019ll find plenty of beautiful works inside and outside the Nelson, as well as around the city. From contemporary to classic to performing arts, we have it all. You can see a ballet, a symphony, a play, explore the arts districts, take in a live jazz show any day of the week and so much more. Even make a day of hunting down the beautiful fountains of KC. As the City of Fountains, we\u2019ve got a few.\nAnd we didn\u2019t forget about the kiddos. If you are bringing the whole family on this trip, the kids won\u2019t be bored. Let them express their creativity in an interactive art studio or experience the wonder of sea life at Crown Center.

As a leader on the racetrack and philanthropist within the community, Garmin is proud to continue and expand our relationship with Martin who will serve as a passionate ambassador of the Garmin brand.\u201d\nMartin added: \u201cI am excited to join the Garmin team which merges my passion for racing with my enthusiasm for fishing, hunting and outdoor activities and now, into the aviation segment with the G5000 integrated flight deck upgrade in my Beechjet 400A. We utilize the Beechjet extensively as a business tool to travel to over 36 NASCAR events annually. With added safety benefits provided by the G5000 such as Synthetic Vision Technology and flight envelope protection, we will be able to operate with the best situational awareness tools available on the market.\u201d\nGarmin ambassador Martin Truex Jr. in his G5000-equipped Beechjet 400A.\nMartin\u2019s Beechjet has been equipped with the G5000 integrated flight deck upgrade, which significantly modernizes the cockpit with zero-time avionics and provides a path to fulfill global airspace modernization initiatives, including Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B). The G5000 system also supports a wide range of capabilities including coupled wide area augmentation system (WAAS/SBAS) and PBN/RNP 0.3 with LPV/APV approaches.\nIn addition to the aircraft\u2019s previously completed upgrades, including Genuine Hawker winglets and a complete interior refurbishment and custom exterior paint scheme, all modifications are part of Textron Aviation\u2019s Hawker 400 XPR upgrade program.\nThe G5000 provides the flight crew with an elevated level of situational awareness and increased safety benefits with Synthetic Vision Technology (SVT), which presents a 3D depiction of terrain, obstacles, traffic and the runway environment on the high resolution widescreen flight displays. Boasting tangible benefits such as reduced operational cost, significant weight savings and more, the G5000 upgrade will further extend the overall life of the aircraft for Martin.\nThe installation of the G5000 integrated flight deck upgrade in Martin\u2019s Beechjet was recently completed at Textron Aviation\u2019s Service Center in Tampa, Florida. \nThe post Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Driver Martin Truex Jr.\u2019s Beechjet 400A is G5000-Equipped appeared first on Garmin Blog .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "martin truex jr.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "carl wolf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin truex jr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nascar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toyota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "textron aviation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "synthetic vision technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garmin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tampa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T18:20:20.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "636dc53efceb2fe8d9959d21abbe6a822811d4f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5PqyZzF9uE0fADOuICehrh0OWQTuXaKZTJlq5.81A6tb3pM0Rnhus.1nu9cN_PHvFul3CXz88Epc5LOaZVHPX", "site_full": "adventures.garmin.com", "site": "garmin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Sella Robon | Garmin Adventures", "title_full": "Sella Robon | Garmin Adventures", "published": "2017-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.879, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "636dc53efceb2fe8d9959d21abbe6a822811d4f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5PqyZzF9uE0fADOuICehrh0OWQTuXaKZTJlq5.81A6tb3pM0Rnhus.1nu9cN_PHvFul3CXz88Epc5LOaZVHPX", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sella Robon | Garmin Adventures", "text": "\nDownload this adventure with BaseCamp. \nDon't have BaseCamp? \nGet the free software that allows you to create, search and download adventures.

When the race dust had settled at the end of Sunday, Muroya of Japan stood atop both the Indy race podium and the world championship podium. Martin Sonka of the Czech Republic finished out the season in second place, followed by Canadian McLeod in third.\nPete McLeod of Canada performs during qualifying day at the eighth round of the Red Bull Air Race World Championship at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, United States on October 14, 2017.\nIn addition to the great world championship finish, McLeod won the 2017 DHL Fastest Lap Award, given to the race pilot with the most qualifier wins throughout the course of a season. Four consecutive top-qualifier positions in Chiba, Budapest, Kazan and Porto made him an easy winner.\nThe 2017 season may have to come to a close, but that only leaves hope for 2018.

Building on the success of its predecessor series, echoMAP CHIRP, the new ECHOMAP Plus features powerful sonar capabilities, preloaded charts and mapping, and built-in Wi-Fi for access to the new Garmin ActiveCaptain\u00c2 marine app for the ultimate connected boating experience.\nThe ECHOMAP series has been popular since its introduction nearly five years ago. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken the proven design of these all-in-one combos and have given them exciting new functionality to meet the demands of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s angler, including keyed-assist touchscreens and connectivity capabilities. Whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trolling for Mahi or targeting bass, the ECHOMAP Plus series has you covered.\n\nAvailable in a range of display sizes to accommodate nearly every boat and budget, the Plus series features a bright, sunlight-readable 4-, 6-, 7- or 9-inch display. The 6-inch units are new to the ECHOMAP series and are larger with more pixels and easier to read than previous 5-inch models. The ECHOMAP Plus series also offers the convenience of a new keyed-assist touchscreen on the 7- and 9-inch units, which gives users quick access to the features they use most.\nStaying connected on and off the water is easier than before with the ECHOMAP Plus series. Thanks to its built-in Wi-Fi 1 , anglers can take advantage of the free all-in-one Garmin ActiveCaptain mobile app that creates a simple yet powerful connection between a compatible mobile device and an ECHOMAP Plus. Use the ActiveCaptain app to access, update and purchase maps and charts from the OneChart\u00c2 storefront on a mobile device anytime, and reference the ActiveCaptain community for marina and other points of interest details, access to Quickdraw\u00c2 Community data and more. ActiveCaptain also provides smart notifications 2 directly to the plotter/combo, over-the-air software updates, off-vessel planning capabilities and so much more.\nThese new connectivity features make it possible for anglers to purchase the latest map and study it to plan their next trip all before stepping foot on the boat. Once the ECHOMAP Plus is powered on, the maps and charts will be instantly available, and the user can rest assured that the software will always be up to date with the latest feature improvements from Garmin before heading out for the day.\nFor crystal-clear scanning of fish and structure, the ECHOMAP Plus offers built-in CHIRP traditional sonar and CHIRP ClearV\u0102\u017a\u00c2 and SideV\u0102\u017a scanning sonar. Instead of just sending one single frequency, CHIRP sends a continuous sweep of frequencies and interprets them individually upon their return, creating crisper fish arches with better target separation. For anglers who want to see objects and structure below the boat, ClearV\u0102\u017a provides a nearly photographic view with excellent resolution and target separation in both freshwater and saltwater. The ECHOMAP Plus \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sv\u00e2\u20ac\u009d models also add SideV\u0102\u017a scanning for customers who want to see what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located on both sides of the boat.\nAll 7- and 9-inch Plus units provide support for all Garmin Panoptix\u00c2 all-seeing sonar transducers, so anglers can see real-time sonar imagery at video-like speed. Panoptix shows an image of fish swimming and moving toward or away from the boat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even while stationary \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in real time and up to 100 feet away. A free software update planned for Q1 2018 will also enable the 7- and 9-inch ECHOMAP Plus units to share user and sonar data between devices.\nAvailable with preloaded cartography for coastal or fresh waters, the new ECHOMAP Plus units feature built-in BlueChart g2 charts, U.S. or Canada LakeV\u0102\u017a\u00c2 HD maps. U.S. LakeV\u0102\u017a is an extensive database of more than 17,000 inland lakes, reservoirs and rivers that includes over 13,000 lakes with high-definition 1-foot contours. Canada LakeV\u0102\u017a features more than 13,500 lakes, 4,800 of which have 1-foot contours.\nThe new ECHOMAP Plus series will be available in Q4 2017, with suggested retail prices ranging from $199.99 to $1299.99.

The Descent Mk1 is being launched in conjunction with DEMA in Orlando, Florida, Nov. 1-4, booth #2234.\n\u201cNo matter what kind of diver you are, the Descent Mk1 is the intuitive dive computer you won\u2019t want to take off. And with features built for in and out of the water, packed into a watch form factor, you don\u2019t have to,\u201d said Dan Bartel, Garmin vice president of global consumer sales. \u201cThe Descent Mk1 was built by divers, for divers and we are so excited that our passion for engineering purpose-built devices, now supports the passion of underwater explorers.\u201d\n\nThe Descent Mk1 includes an Apnea mode for recreational and competitive free divers, and Apnea Hunt mode for spear fishers. When the diver submerges, the device will automatically start the dive, and when the diver surfaces from the water, it will automatically stop the dive. The Descent Mk1 supports up to six gases including air, nitrox and trimix. While enjoying their dive under the water, useful information such as depth, dive time, temperature, NDL/TTS, ascent/descent rates, gas mix, PO2, N2 loading, decompression/safety stop information, time-of-day, and more on a crisp 1.2-inch color display. The diver can switch to the dive compass and additional data pages with the push of a button, or with a quick double tap on the screen.\nThe dive computer utilizes the B\u00fchlmann ZHL-16c algorithm with configurable conservatism settings. Choose from three pre-set conservatism settings, or enter custom Gradient Factors.\n\nSelectable tone and vibration alerts help keep divers informed throughout their dive. When worn over a divers bare wrist, the Garmin Elevate wrist-based heart rate technology 1 will monitor pulse and track exertion levels. The Descent Mk1 will automatically uploads dive logs to Garmin Connect\u2122 for post-dive analysis. Divers can name their dive, and go back in app to review dive data such as type of dive, temperature, entry and exit points and more.\nTopside, the Descent Mk1 features a high-sensitivity GPS and GLONASS satellite tracking for map-based surface navigation including ABC (altimeter, barometer and compass) sensors. Beyond the full range of diving functions, the Descent Mk1 offers a complete feature set of sports/training, fitness and outdoor navigation tools.

These new fishfinders are the perfect entry-level solution for anglers who want the best sonar available plus the ability to create and store their own contour maps.\nLike the first-gen STRIKER series, the STRIKER Plus offers built-in CHIRP traditional sonar and CHIRP ClearV\u00fc and SideV\u00fc scanning sonar technology. In addition to crystal clear fish arches and remarkable target separation with CHIRP sonar, Garmin ClearV\u00fc shows a nearly photographic wide image of what passes below the boat, while SideV\u00fc gives anglers a crisp, clear view of what lies off to each side of the boat, including structure, submerged objects and fish.\nNobody knows the waters better than the anglers that fish them, and now STRIKER Plus users can create HD fishing maps of the places they\u2019ve been. Thanks to the built-in Quickdraw Contours mapping software, it\u2019s easy to create and store up to 2 million acres of maps with 1-foot contours. Once the feature is turned on, users will instantly see contours with labels generated right on the screen as the boat moves \u2013 there\u2019s no waiting around or sending the files to Garmin. The results are quick and accurate, and can be viewed in real-time, or created in the background for use at a later time. For the most comprehensive coverage, Quickdraw Contours clearly shows where usable depth information has been collected and where gaps exist, so users can easily see what still needs to be collected.\nWith the addition of built-in Wi-Fi 1 , users can take advantage of the free all-in-one Garmin ActiveCaptain mobile app that creates a simple yet powerful connection between a compatible mobile device and a STRIKER Plus unit. Thanks to ActiveCaptain, waypoints and routes can be transferred directly to a STRIKER Plus unit making it easier than ever for anglers to pre-fish a body of water. Smart notifications are also delivered right on the screen as well as over-the-air software updates so users will always have access to the latest feature improvements from Garmin before heading out for the day. ActiveCaptain also makes it possible to quickly and easily access the Quickdraw Contours Community to share or download new user-collected data.\nThe STRIKER Plus series comes standard with a built-in high-sensitivity GPS receiver, so fishermen have the ability to not only see fish and structure below the boat, but also to quickly and easily mark favorite fishing spots and other areas of interest like brush piles, stumps and docks, and get back to them. When trolling, the high-sensitivity GPS provides an update once per second, giving fishermen the precision needed to dial in the exact trolling speed and optimize lure presentation. Users can also share waypoint data across multiple STRIKER Plus units, as well as the new ECHOMAP Plus series devices.\n\nAvailable with a 5- or 7-inch display, the Plus series also adds a larger 4.3- and 9-inch model to the lineup, all with bright, sunlight readable color displays. With a rugged design and keyed interface that\u2019s built to withstand the harsh marine environment, the STRIKER Plus series comes with everything anglers need \u2013 including transom- and trolling-motor transducer and mounting hardware \u2013 to make getting on the water fast and easy. The six new models offer flexible mounting so the devices can be tilted for an optimum-viewing angle. An optional flush-mount kit is available for in-dash installation. Additionally, the STRIKER Plus series is compatible with a wide-range of optional Garmin scanning transducers to customize sonar performance and installation options.\nThe new STRIKER Plus fishfinders will be available soon with suggested retail prices ranging from $139.99 to $699.99.
