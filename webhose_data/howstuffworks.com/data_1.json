Vasily Pindyurin/Getty Images \nIt's a perennial joke: \"If I die, delete my browser history.\" Everyone gets it because no matter how unquestionable your internet activity might be, we all have weird Google searches people might not understand when taken out of context. And we've all visited someone's Facebook page one too many times. But even though the internet has advanced in leaps and bounds, our understanding of our right to privacy on the internet has been slower to catch up. \nThat's why the guys at Stuff They Don't Want You To Know teamed up with Will Pearson and Mango Hattikudur at Part-Time Genius for a special two-part episode on internet privacy. First, Matt Frederick, Ben Bowlin and Noel Brown tackle the tough question: Can you really delete your internet history? The answer might surprise you. \nSince the late 1990s, the internet has become an integral part of life all over the world. Almost 4 billion people have an internet presence. That's more than 50 percent of the global population, up from just 7 percent in 2000. Access to the internet is becoming less of a luxury, and more of a human right, since so much of life is centered around being able to get online. \nBecause of the amount of internet usage worldwide, collecting information on users has become a huge business. Search engines like Google and social media sites like Facebook have an enormous amount of data on their users' lives and daily routines that is extremely valuable for advertising and marketing. But it's also valuable to governments and, of course, hackers. Thanks to targeted marketing, more people are realizing just how much information they're allowing onto the internet. But deleting your social media account might not be the fail-safe answer you're hoping for. \nThe problem with deleting information is that nothing is ever really gone from the internet. Thanks to the terms and services that none of us read \u2014 but all of us agree to \u2014 it's very hard to retract info you've already shared. You, and other users of that site, might not be able to see the deleted info, but it's still stored somewhere. And in some cases, that content doesn't really belong to you anymore. \nFor example, you have to request Facebook delete your account permanently, and Google can keep your information in perpetuity and use it however the company sees fit. YouTube might take down a video, but it still exists on the servers. Android phones can listen to your conversations and record audio without asking your permission first. And in the United States, at least, this is legal: In March 2017, Congress voted to allow companies to collect and sell their users' browsing data. ( Not so much in Europe. ) \nBut it's not just companies that want to sell you stuff that want this info; the National Security Agency has also benefitted from this setup. Matt, Ben and Noel covered a lot about the NSA on this previous podcast , but what matters here is that the government wants information on who is using what websites and for what reason. Under the guise of \"national security,\" it's tried everything from using backdoors to unlock iPhones to locate suspected terrorists to trying to discover who used certain websites that helped those who protested against the Trump inauguration. It'll come down to legal battles to determine who will prevail: the citizens or Homeland Security. \nBeyond never using a computer again, what can you do to protect your information? Listen to the podcast here and see what Matt, Ben and Noel have to say. And be sure to listen to the second podcast of this special two-part collaboration between Stuff They Don't Want You To Know and Part-Time Genius. Ben, Matt, Will and Mango chat about what companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google and Twitter know about what you search, where you live and what shows you hate-watch with your friends.

Salzhauer has come under fire for his outrageous plastic surgery Snapchat videos, but they also helped him land a reality TV show. Rodrigo Varela/Getty Images for WE tv/Getty Images \nAre you thinking of having plastic surgery ? If so, you might want to Google your chosen surgeon to find out if his social media postings are in line with what you want out of a doctor. It turns out that social media antics aren't limited to celebs, U.S. presidents and wild teenagers \u2014 plastic surgeons are jumping on the bandwagon, turning the operating room into a circus. Some plastic surgeons are posting videos to Snapchat and Instagram where doctors perform tricks, like juggling breast implants, or wear elaborate costumes. One doctor invited people to come enjoy free booze and a DJ while he performed surgery live. On an actual human being. \nCiting concern over patient safety, a team of experts at Northwestern University are trying to \"take the circus tent down.\" They recently penned a brand-new code of ethical behavior outlining how and when plastic surgery videos may be shared. The guidelines were published in the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Journal , and will be presented at the upcoming American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) meeting on October 6. \n\"There is increasingly vulgar content by a growing number of plastic surgeons that is not in the best interest of the patient,\" says senior author Dr. Clark Schierle, a plastic surgeon and faculty member of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in a press release . Schierle recalls one post that featured a surgeon holding an abdominal tummy tuck specimen in a cradling position. The doctor also used a Snapchat filter to add an infant face to the specimen. \"This is inappropriate handling of human tissue for entertainment purposes,\" Schierle says. \nThe proposed guidelines include getting written consent from patients before they appear in social media videos; obscuring patient identifiers (like face and tattoos) unless the patient agrees separately to expose those; letting patients know they have the right to refuse to appear in a video without this affecting care; and \"upholding professional standards,\" among other rules. The new ethics guidelines will be voted on at the October meeting; Schierle hopes they will become part of the association's code of conduct which ASPS members agree to abide by. \nThe guidelines could face opposition from surgeons who've achieved significant success thanks to their online antics. Many of the surgeons engaging in this over-the-top-behavior are hoping to inspire the same sort of success as Michael \"Dr. Miami\" Salzhauer , a Florida-based plastic surgeon who livestreams unedited video of patients undergoing cosmetic surgery. He has more than 2 million social media followers, a two-year waiting list and his own reality television show to boot. The problem is each copycat surgeon is wilder than the next, with hopes that these shenanigans will attract attention and followers. \nAnd that could spell problems in the operating room. \"Instead of focusing on providing the most efficient surgical procedure to help the patient, the surgeon is distracted by hamming it up for the camera,\" Schierle says. Now That's Interesting No matter how fun they try to make it, surgery is serious business.

VCG/Getty Images \nGood news is hard to come by these days, but here's a little: China's wild panda numbers are up! In 2016, the bamboo-eating giant panda ( Ailuropoda melanoleuca ) native to southern central China was reclassified as \"vulnerable\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), after spending nearly 30 years on the \"endangered\" list. The species' wild population has grown by 17 percent in the past decade, bringing its numbers up to more than 1,800 pandas living in the wild, according to the most recent census . \nAnd although this is terrific news, two new pieces of research show risk still exists for the giant panda due to infrastructure development and livestock grazing. \nThe first new study , published in the Sept. 25, 2017, issue of the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, looks at what brought about this population growth, and whether it's likely to continue. \n\"What my colleagues and I wanted to know was how the panda's habitat has changed over the last four decades, because the extent and connectivity of a species' habitat is also a major factor in determining its risk of extinction,\" said coauthor Stuart Pimm, professor of conservation ecology at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment , in a press release . \nThe researchers used satellite imagery data to figure out the change in land use over the panda's entire geographic range. They found that between 1976 and 2001, panda habitat decreased by 23 percent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but that it actually increased slightly between 2001 and 2013. This encouraging trend has been due mostly to bans on commercial logging in panda habitat, as well as the establishment of 67 panda preserves and education for people living within these preserves. \nBut the changes in these panda-friendly areas of China haven't all been good: Loads of new infrastructure like roads and hydropower stations has been built since 2001. \n\"These have been the major factor in fragmenting the habitat,\" said Pimm. \"There was nearly three times the density of roads in 2013 than in 1976.\" Over the past two decades, livestock grazing has damaged one-third of all giant panda habitat in Wanglang National Nature Preserve, one of China's oldest and most important panda preserves. Binbin Li \nAlthough there's no aingle permanent solution to securing the conservation of these iconic animals , the research team suggests establishing panda corridors between the existing patches of habitat. That would allow the remaining wild pandas to find each other, and prevent any part of the population from becoming isolated. \nA separate cooperative research initiative conducted by Chinese and U.S. scientists looked at the impact of livestock on panda habitats. The second study , published online Oct. 3, 2017, in the journal Biological Conservation, found that over the past 15 years, livestock numbers in China's Wanglang National Nature Preserve have increased 900 percent, damaging one third of all giant panda habitat in the park. \n\"These problems are not unique to our study area, but common throughout the panda nature reserves and habitats. It is not just an ecological problem, but also a gamble between the communities, the nature reserves, local governments and other stakeholders,\" added Li Sheng, an assistant professor of conservation biology at Peking University involved in the second study. \n\"This long-term monitoring shows that the pandas are being driven out of the areas that are heavily used by the livestock, especially the park's valleys,\" said Pimm, who participated in research for both studies. \"These lower elevation areas are crucial for giant pandas, especially during winter and spring.\" Now That's Interesting Even though the diet of giant pandas consists of 99 percent bamboo, the animals have the digestive system of a carnivore .

The reason they do that back-and-forth-dance in the road is more about instinct than anything else. Przemek Komon/EyeEm/Getty Images \nYou might be familiar with the moment: You're driving down the road \u2014 perhaps one lined with autumn 's trademark crimson, gold and amber foliage \u2014 and you see an Eastern gray squirrel ahead, right in your car's path. No problem. It sees you coming and scampers away. \nOr does it? As you draw near, the squirrel apparently panics and runs back into your path. Then out again, then back, then out again. And just when you think it's OK to zoom past ... so much for fall's cool colors. You're now a squirrel killer, and you are not alone. \nDuring the fall months, squirrel roadkill is about as common as the changing colors on the trees. Part of the reason for the deadly uptick this time of year is that squirrels are simply more active as they fatten up and store nuts for the winter. Plus, young squirrels born the previous fall are out of the nest for the first time, trying to figure out their way in this crazy world. And as we know from our human experiences, young ones don't always make the smartest choices. \nBut more to the point: Why do squirrels engage in this odd, serpentining, running-into-the-path-of-an-oncoming-car behavior? Are they stupid? Do they have a death wish? Is car-dodging some sort of sick squirrel game? And how do you, as the driver of a car, avoid this melodrama? \nEastern gray and Eastern fox squirrels are proven to be complex thinkers, even capable of figuring out the most complicated bird feeders. And they spend most of their lives trying to not die. \nThe trying-to-fake-out-a-linebacker behavior we see in squirrels with cars bearing down on them is actually instinct taking over, according to Thaddeus McRae, a biologist and squirrel researcher at Lee University in Cleveland, Tennessee. \n\"The zig-zag run does seem to function as a way to throw off hawks swooping in for a meal,\" McRae says. In other words, for the 30-plus million years that tree squirrels have been around, this maneuver has helped them dodge birds of prey and other predators. It's only recently (in the last 100 years or so) that autos have entered the picture. \"This zig-zag run does absolutely nothing to throw off approaching vehicles,\" McRae adds. \nMcRae cautions that this theory, while commonly held by researchers, has not been officially field tested. (One wonders what that field test would look like.) \nIn summary: Want to avoid running over squirrels this fall? If you see one in the road ahead, be patient. Let the squirrel do its dance. Eventually it should hop out of the way. And you can go about enjoying the season's more pleasant offerings. Now That's Enlightening As if squirrels don't face enough challenges, here's another killer: power lines.

But Columbia University scientists have identified another, thus-far untapped energy source that might have just as much promise \u2014 the massive amount of water that continually evaporates from the nation's lakes and reservoirs. \nThat natural phenomenon, they say, could be tapped into by devices containing sheets covered with bacterial spores, which contract and expand in response to changes of moisture \u2014 almost like the flexing of a muscle. That mechanical \"muscle\" action, in turn, could be used to generate gigantic amounts of electricity, they say. \nIn a newly published article in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers estimate that inland bodies of water in the United States have at least the theoretical potential to generate as much as 325 gigawatts of electricity, an amount equals to nearly 70 percent of our nationwide electrical consumption in 2015. \n\"Our artificial muscle absorbs water evaporating from the surface of the lake,\" says chemical engineer and study lead author Ahmet-Hamdi Cavusoglu, via email. \"As it absorbs water, the muscle swells and expands. When the muscle absorbs all the possible water, the shutters above the muscle open so that water can evaporate into the air from the muscle. As the water leaves the muscle, the muscle shrinks, pulling at a turbine to generate energy, similar to a rower on a rowing machine pulling at the turbine.\" The findings of the study indicate that the southern and western United States have the greatest capacity to produce evaporation-generated power. Columbia University \nIn practice, that amount of power might be difficult to achieve, since as the article notes, it would require completely covering the entire surface of just about every domestic lake and reservoir. But as even a much smaller deployment of evaporation engines \u2014 say, covering 10 percent of those water surfaces \u2014 still could add a substantial amount of electrical capacity to the nation's supply. \n\"If we were to cover only 10 percent of the top ten lakes and reservoirs we studied with the most efficient evaporation engines possible,\" says Cavusoglu, now is an associate director of the Academic Venture Exchange and director of partnerships at the Innovation Accelerator Foundation , \"we could harness an average power of 7.1 gigawatts from an area of about 560 square miles [1450 square kilometers], which is greater than the utility solar power sector in the U.S. in 2013.\" \nAnd that's just if they used lakes and reservoirs. Evaporation energy conceivably could be harvested from other sources as well, ranging from rivers and coastlines to farm fields that have been moistened by irrigation. \n\"Water is pretty much ubiquitous in the environment,\" says Ozgur Sahin , an associate professor of biological sciences and physics at Columbia and one of the study's co-authors. (Sahin and colleagues pioneered the use of spores and evaporation to create tiny engines, as detailed in this 2015 Nature Communications article .) \nUsing evaporation as a renewable energy source could have other advantages as well, the researchers note. Evaporation is driven by solar energy, which is absorbed by a body of water and stored, almost like a gigantic battery, and then released gradually. That means an evaporation engine could produce electricity with fewer fluctuations than solar panels or wind turbines, whose production drops whenever the wind dies down or the sun goes behind a cloud. \nAdditionally, evaporation engines could alter the amount of water vapor given off by a lake or reservoir or another source, providing aid to water-strapped parts of the nation. The engines could also control the electrical output. \n\"An interesting property we realized is that by slowing down evaporation, we can raise the temperature of water, effectively storing energy as heat that we could later release on demand,\" says Cavusoglu. \"Depending on the local weather conditions, we could release this stored energy rapidly as additional evaporation to match fluctuations in electrical energy demand. This would be similar to how hydroelectric dams vary their power output by changing the flow rate of water through the dam.\" \nSo far, evaporation engines have been tested only in the laboratory, and there's a lot more research and development work ahead before the technology could be scaled up to the size where it might become a major source of electricity. \n\"First, better and bigger materials need to be made that can effectively harness energy from evaporation,\" says Cavusoglu. \"Currently, the Sahin lab is researching how to make better spore-based materials and building larger engine prototypes. We hope to see larger prototypes being demonstrated in the next few years.\" Now That's Interesting According to a 2013 study by U.S. and Canadian scientists, a typical day's worth of evaporation from the Great Lakes could amount to 820 billion gallons (3.1 trillion liters) \u2014 nearly 20 times the flow rate of Niagara Falls.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "patrick j. kiger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "juan carlos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sahin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmet-hamdi cavusoglu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ozgur sahin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cavusoglu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "columbia university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nature communications", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "innovation accelerator foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "academic venture exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niagara falls", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T16:04:45.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b58f4035adc41e1b953a5f4f7e610baeb78e1d09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoVIvuwAucPT6nvXj5WkYV9x3MpoBh61ZBPGYCYYQhQPvSqPMGatemQmXPtBuakC8U-", "site_full": "shows.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "Leggo Eleven's Eggo: A Tale of Frozen Waffles", "title_full": "Leggo Eleven's Eggo: A Tale of Frozen Waffles", "published": "2017-10-04T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/waffle-resize.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 36, "comments": 0, "shares": 36}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b58f4035adc41e1b953a5f4f7e610baeb78e1d09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoVIvuwAucPT6nvXj5WkYV9x3MpoBh61ZBPGYCYYQhQPvSqPMGatemQmXPtBuakC8U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T13:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Leggo Eleven's Eggo: A Tale of Frozen Waffles", "text": "a division of InfoSpace Holdings LLC Newsletter \nGet the best of HowStuffWorks by email.

Hero Images/Getty Images \nThe U.S. has come a long way since the days of Reefer Madness . Thirty states \u2014 most recently, West Virginia \u2014 and the District of Columbia have approved marijuana for either medical or recreational purposes. And polls suggest more Americans than ever \u2014 61 percent \u2014 want marijuana legalized nationwide. \nWhile debate continues over marijuana's health benefits versus its risks, recent studies have placed cannabis squarely in the middle of the conversation over what has been called \"the worst drug epidemic in U.S. history.\" And this time, some researchers say, marijuana might be a part of the solution. \nAs countless news reports have said, abuse of opioids \u2014 including prescription opioids, heroin and illegally manufactured fentanyl \u2014 is the leading cause of death in the United States. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse , an estimated 90 people die every day from opioid overdose, and 16,000 a year from prescription opioids alone. \nSome observers link the epidemic to pharmaceuticals aggressively marketing highly addictive opioids since the 1990s, and doctors aggressively prescribing them to victims of chronic pain. \nAccording to a 2014 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine \"chronic noncancer pain is common in the United States, and the proportion of patients with noncancer pain who receive prescriptions for opioids has almost doubled over the past decade. In parallel to this increase in prescriptions, rates of opioid use disorders and overdose deaths have risen dramatically.\" \nMethadone, oxycodone and hydrocodone are the most commonly overdosed prescription opioids, according to the Centers for Disease Control . \nFurther, a study released in the October 2017 edition of journal Health Affairs notes that as overdoses on prescription opioids have decreased since federal initiatives on prescriptions were put in place in 2010, overdoses on heroin and fentanyl have spiked. This strikes at the heart of the chronic-pain-and-opioids issue, signaling that addiction to opioids, not management of chronic pain, has become the central problem \u2014 i.e., making prescription opioids less available has only forced those addicted to seek other (often deadlier) resources. \nSo, where does marijuana enter the picture? Well, in some cases, it doesn't \u2014 or, at least not legally. Marijuana is considered at the federal level a Schedule 1 drug, meaning, among other things, it's not accepted for medical use. On the state level, it is outlawed for medical and recreational purposes in 20 U.S. states. And in the 30 states that have approved it in one form or another, it's in the infancy of its introduction into medical and economic communities . \nBut several studies have shown that medical marijuana can do what opioids can do \u2014 manage chronic pain. Specifically, Nabiximols (a botanical extract of CBD and THC) has shown promise. And researchers from University of Pennsylvania did find that opiate-related deaths decreased by almost one-third in 13 states after medical marijuana was legalized. \n\"Marijuana, like any other medicine for pain, does not eliminate chronic pain, but it makes it more manageable,\" Dr. Beatriz Carlini, senior research scientist at University of Washington Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute, says in an email. Carlini cites a 2017 report on cannabinoids from the National Academy of Medicine that collected results from several studies. The National Academy report concluded that \"In adults with chronic pain, patients who were treated with cannabis or cannabinoids are more likely to experience a clinically significant reduction in pain symptoms.\" \nAlso, using medical marijuana instead of opioids virtually eliminates the possibility of overdose deaths, says Michael Patterson, CEO of U.S. Cannabis Pharmaceutical Research and Development, which baldly promotes its mission to \"cultivate cannabusiness.\" Dr. Beatriz Carlini recommends those with opioid addiction have easy as access to Narcan, a prescription medicine that can reverse an overdose. Scott Olson/Getty Images \n\"Cannabis has never killed anybody in human history,\" Patterson says. \"It's time we wake up and stop believing the fake news. Once you show people the facts about cannabis, it's hard for them to stay on their prohibition stance.\" \nCannabis does have potentially harmful side effects, Carlini maintains. Among other things, \"its chronic and heavy use may result in 'cannabis use disorder,'\" she says, \"and early initiation of cannabis use may affect the developing brain. Also, in people genetically susceptible to psychosis , marijuana use can trigger schizophrenia and other psychotic states.\" \nStill, victims of chronic pain in the U.S. are currently faced with choosing between 1) a prescription to opioids, which manage pain but are highly addictive and can lead to overdose and death, 2) limited access to legal or illegal medical marijuana, depending on where they live, and 3) over-the-counter pain relievers approved by the Food and Drug Administration. \nCarlini calls for an increase in access to medical marijuana, as well as education efforts targeting patients and healthcare about the potential for marijuana to treat chronic pain. \n\"In the long run, this can help,\" she says. \"But recommending marijuana won't do much to prevent overdose deaths of those severely addicted to opioids, to help those already living [on] the streets, injecting heroin just to feel normal. At this point, their brains are already hijacked by opiates.\" \nTo help those with opioid addiction, Carlini recommends Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) , as well as access to Narcan , a prescription medicine that can block the effects of opioids and reverse an overdose. Now That's Sad A recent Centers for Disease Control report says that between 2014 and 2015 (the most recent stats available), opioid overdose deaths in teenagers aged 15 to 19 jumped over 19 percent from the previous year.

It usually lasts a lot longer than we'd expect (an average duration of 18 days !) but does eventually abate. Others experience the misery of a chronic cough due to allergens or asthma . In children, however, a chronic cough or wheezing can be the result of not just a cold or allergies, but also a very particular protein. \nHere's the backstory: Researchers have been puzzled why children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) had the cough and wheezing associated with asthma, but didn't respond to the same drugs that work for adults with asthma. RSV is a super common and typically mild virus that acts a lot like a cold would in infected people. \nA protein appears to be behind that discrepancy. An October 2017 study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology found that the protein, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (or TRPV1), had increased activation in children's \u2014 but not adults' \u2014 bronchial epithelial cells infected with RSV. \nThat's interesting because the TRPV1 protein is known for playing a role in all the miserable stuff that comes with a cough: narrowing airways, mucus and the reflex of a cough. \nLearning that TRPV1 activation isn't allergy -related opens the door to developing new and more effective cough treatment for young people. \nAnd that's a significant development, especially when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Pediatric Advisory Committee has declared that the risk of using certain opioids in children's cough medication outweighs the benefits. NOW THAT'S INTERESTING Many cough treatments aren't treating the cough themselves; they're just using opioids to blunt the body's response to the cough or reflex. Finding a way to understand \u2014 and treat \u2014 the cough itself could help those 18 days of misery get much shorter.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T21:55:31.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f2ee9c57314319a2b6947d39e74ce1a0ce60b97c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyIQWXmo9DxhzXHkdl0J7WXMBMkX0XqgmpalbAoYggsYOwz7KOSNQxSQDbGqmvWOkSA1jFrgH3Xr41T7XQcPoO.MNuxUTyn0lCPbL.6UFjOiOJkppq5k5pC", "site_full": "people.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW?type=article", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "Who Are the Rohingyas?", "title_full": "Who Are the Rohingyas?", "published": "2017-10-04T20:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s.hswstatic.com/gif/rohinga.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 66, "comments": 0, "shares": 66}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f2ee9c57314319a2b6947d39e74ce1a0ce60b97c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyIQWXmo9DxhzXHkdl0J7WXMBMkX0XqgmpalbAoYggsYOwz7KOSNQxSQDbGqmvWOkSA1jFrgH3Xr41T7XQcPoO.MNuxUTyn0lCPbL.6UFjOiOJkppq5k5pC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Melanie Radzicki McManus", "published": "2017-10-04T20:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Who Are the Rohingyas?", "text": "by Melanie Radzicki McManus POSTED Oct 4, 2017 Rohingya Muslim refugees holds bags of goods as they reach Balukhali refugee camp by the field in Bangladesh's Ukhiya district on October 4, 2017. Thousands now cross the border each day. FRED DUFOUR/AFP/Getty Images \nThey're considered to be among the most persecuted citizens in the world, yet they're not well known in many parts of the globe. \"They\" are the Rohingya, a group of Muslims who hail from northern Myanmar (formerly Burma) near the Bangladeshi border. Harassed, abused and exploited on and off for decades, today this community of some 2 million is scattered among several Asian countries. Most live in Myanmar and Bangladesh, but there are also 250,000 in Pakistan, 300,000 in Saudi Arabia, and 100,00 in Thailand, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates, collectively. \nA fresh wave of violence against the Myanmar Rohingya began in August 2017, after Rohingya militant groups attacked some police posts in the Myanmar state of Rakhine. Infuriated, the Myanmar military lashed back at all Rohingya, expelling citizens from their homes, burning entire villages, raping and killing people. Some 370,000 Rohingya fled to neighboring Bangladesh in what U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called \"a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\" \nThe reason for the Rohingyas' perennial persecution is layered and complex. The group traces its roots to Myanmar's Arakan region bordering Bangladesh, where their Arab, Bengali and Mughal ancestors settled in the 7th century C.E. The Rohingya's neighbors today are the Rakhine, Buddhists who trace their ancestry to Hindus and Mongols. The Rakhine are the ethnic majority in the Arakan region, while the Rohingya are the minority. \nSeeds of conflict were first planted during World War II, when the British defeated the Japanese and reclaimed Burma in the process. The Brits promised the Rohingya they would create a separate Muslim state for them as thanks for their loyalty and assistance during their battle with the Japanese. But they never followed through. \nA few years later, the Rohingya asked that their slice of northern Arakan be folded into a corner of the newly created country of Pakistan to create a homeland for their people. That didn't happen, either. Instead, the area of Pakistan that they were hoping would become their home became part of the new Bangladesh. More ominously, the Burmese government began to distrust the Rohingya, with their repeated attempts to secure a land of their own. Tensions also began brewing with their Buddhist neighbors. \nDespite all of this, the Rohingya were still considered one of Burma's official indigenous ethnic nationalities. Rohingya served in the Burmese parliament and in other governmental positions, and overall life was not too bad. Until 1962. That year, Burma's military junta seized control of the country and life for the Rohingya began a downward spiral. \nThe government declared them foreigners in 1982 \u2014 the new citizenship law said there needed to be proof that a family had lived in Myanmar before 1948 and many Rohingya did not have any paperwork to prove it. In 1990 they were stripped of their right to vote. They also are restricted in where they can travel, move to, be educated, or even which health services they can access. Effectively, the Rohingya became strangers in their own country. \nMore recently, a nationalist movement among Myanmar's Buddhist community \u2014 90 percent of the population is Buddhist \u2014 spurred deadly clashes between the Rohingya and their Buddhist neighbors in 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2017. Myanmar now says the Rohingya belong in Bangladesh . The Bangladesh government says they do not. \n\"It's pretty clear Myanmar is an anti-Muslim society,\" says Tim Seymour, a hedge fund manager and CNBC on-air commentator who does business in the southeast Asian country. \"They're proud and nationalistic and don't make any bones about it.\" \nOne of the more puzzling pieces of the Rohingya story is Aung San Suu Kyi . Suu Kyi is head of the National League for Democracy (NLD), the political party leading Myanmar's government. She's also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Suu Kyi could do much to help the Rohingya, but she's been curiously silent as the humanitarian crisis unfolds. Experts say there could be various reasons behind her silence and inaction . \nWhile Suu Kyi leads the country, she's not necessarily in control. She was under house arrest for 15 years while she fought the military junta for elections, and the armed forces are still around and still powerful. In addition, the party she represents has never made the Rohingya a priority. Although the group has lived in the country for centuries, the majority of NLD party members (and Myanmar's Buddhist citizens) consider them outsiders, and not true citizens of Myanmar. Islamist political organizations in Bangladesh staged protests after the military crackdown against the Rohingya ethnic group in Myanmar. Protests took place in other parts of the world too. Monirul Alam/NurPhoto via Getty Images \nThen there's the notion of who is really at fault. Seymour says the main assertion he hears about the crisis when he visits Myanmar is that it's being perpetrated by radical Islamic terrorists from Bangladesh and the Middle East \u2014 not by Myanmar citizens or members of its government. \"The other part [of what I hear] is that there are plenty of members of the opposition party who are very interested in creating this chaos and putting pressure on Suu Kyi, which has made her politically cautious.\" Suu Kyi first came to power in November 2015. \nWhile some investors refuse to work in Myanmar until the Rohingya crisis is resolved, Seymour says others are moving forward; Myanmar is seen as \"the new Vietnam,\" ripe for investment and development. With the international business community not expressing outrage, and with the heads of major foreign countries, including the U.S., declining to pressure Suu Kyi, her inaction is given some credibility. Yet the situation has tarnished her image as a heroine. \nThat's likely not much consolation to the Rohingya. Now That's Interesting There are more displaced people living in the world today that at any time in history, according to the United Nations' 2016 Global Trends Report . At the dawn of 2017, there were 65.5 million refugees, a 300,000-person increase from the prior year.

And studies continue to underline the fact that starting the day with a healthy meal is even more so. Jean-Claude Winkler/Getty Images \nSome of us hate breakfast. It's not that we dislike food, it's just that there's something unpalatable about the idea of waking up and immediately eating a cold soup made of milk and tiny sweetened crackers. Or worse: eggs. But breakfast is the most important meal of the day , says our collective mom. But still, we skip breakfast because it seems like an innocuous habit, and we're busy with life, and we just keep doing it and now skipping breakfast is just a Thing We Do. \nBut we should eat a healthy breakfast. Science knows that, and more research just backs that up. \nFor instance: A new study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology adds to our previous understanding that breakfast eaters have better cardiac health because it helps them maintain healthier body weight and cholesterol . The researchers found that skipping breakfast can be associated with an increased risk for a condition called atherosclerosis \u00e2\u0080\u0094 basically the buildup of plaque in the arteries which results in their narrowing and hardening. \nSeems weird, though, right? It's just one measly little meal. \nBut the researchers found the breakfast skippers among us are likely to have an overall unhealthy lifestyle, more often making poor general diet choices, smoking, drinking alcohol with abandon, etc. Plus, people who don't eat breakfast were more likely to be hypertensive and overweight or obese. This illustration shows a healthy artery, and one with a buildup of atherosclerotic plaque. Encyclopaedia Britannica/Universal Images Group/Getty Images \n\"People who regularly skip breakfast likely have an overall unhealthy lifestyle,\" said study author Dr. Valentin Fuster, a cardiologist, director of Mount Sinai Heart and editor-in-chief of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, in a press release . \"This study provides evidence that this is one bad habit people can proactively change to reduce their risk for heart disease.\" \nThe researchers assessed the diets of 4,052 men and women who were free of heart disease or kidney disease. Through a computer survey, they assessed the participants' eating habits by asking them to estimate how much of their caloric intake was consumed in the morning. They found 2.9 percent skipped breakfast, 69.4 percent were low-energy breakfast consumers (with less than 5 percent of their day's calories being consumed in the morning) and 27.7 percent were breakfast eaters (who consumed more than 20 percent of their calories in the morning). Compared with breakfast eaters, breakfast skippers and low-energy breakfast consumers had a higher frequency of atherosclerosis . The breakfast skippers also had the greatest waist circumference, body mass index , blood pressure, blood lipid levels and fasting glucose levels. \nYikes. \n\"Aside from the direct association with cardiovascular risk factors, skipping breakfast might serve as a marker for a general unhealthy diet or lifestyle which in turn is associated with the development and progression of atherosclerosis,\" said study author Jose L. Pe\u0102\u0105alvo, assistant professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, in the press release. \"Our findings are important for health professionals and might be used as a simple message for lifestyle-based interventions and public health strategies, as well as informing dietary recommendations and guidelines.\" Now That's Interesting Eleventh-century theologian Thomas Aquinas didn't think much of the morning meal.

Leemage/Corbis via Getty Images \nIn January 2017, women from across the United States took part in a march to advocate for human and women's rights. While it was certainly a vocal way to express frustration with the political climate, there is a historical precedent for such an event. \nOn an episode of Stuff You Missed in History Class , hosts Holly Frey and Tracy V. Wilson walk us through the Women's March on Versailles, a turning point in French history. \nBut before we get to the march, let's talk a little about Versailles and the crisis that fomented the protest. Versailles , 12 miles (19 kilometers) from Paris, was practically its own town. It was an opulent palace with extensive grounds, many buildings and 60,000 people living or employed there in the late 18th century. Its splendor contrasted starkly with the lives of French commoners in 1789, when the march took place. \nBecause while Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette were having a ball at Versailles, there were serious economic problems in France. The population had grown by 8 million people in eight decades, and agriculture hadn't caught up. There were a few terrible years for crop harvests, and French officials had also attempted to deregulate grain trade \u2014 much to the chagrin of farmers and other French citizens. By 1789, typical French laborers were spending 70 to 90 percent of their wages on bread, as opposed to about half of their wages earlier in the century. \nSo on Oct. 1, when word got out that a huge party with tons of food had been thrown at Versailles, nonaristocratic French folk were not thrilled. \"Though they were overblown reports, they still garnered the ire of public,\" says Holly. \"For one, guests of Versailles were badmouthing the revolution which was just in its infancy ... For another, these men were being treated to a massive feast when many of France's people were going hungry.\" \nAdding to the anger was the fact that there was still a massive bread shortage despite a better harvest year, which made people suspicious. \"People started to gossip that the shortage was purposely being arranged by government to weaken the populace and make them more submissive,\" says Tracy. \nSo on Oct. 5, an estimated 5,000-10,000 people \u2014 mostly women \u2014 met up in Paris to demand the palace's grain stores be released. From there, they walked the 12 miles to Versailles, and gained thousands more followers as they went. \nHear Tracy and Holly recount the dramatic events and aftermath of the march and protest on this episode of Stuff You Missed in History Class.

Urbanandsport/NurPhoto via Getty Images \nFC Barcelona is one of the greatest professional football \u2014 no one calls it soccer outside the U.S. \u2014 teams in the history of the sport. Led by the incomparable Lionel Messi, arguably the best player in the game, FC Barcelona inspires a fierce loyalty among its fans that's nearly inseparable from Spanish politics . The club is based in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, and the citizens there take the club's motto \" M\u00e9s que un club \" (\"More than a club\") very seriously. FC Barcelona (Bar\u00e7a) is indeed a more than a club \u2014 it's a way of life and a symbol of Catalonian nationalism. How it came to fulfill this role is a fascinating one, particularly at this juncture in its history. \nOn Oct. 1, Catalonia voted for independence from Spain. As more than 2 million Catalan citizens flocked to polling stations this past Sunday, they were met by riot police under orders from the Spanish government to stop the vote. Violent clashes left more than 900 people injured , only ratcheting up the long-running political tensions between the Catalan region and the central government. \nSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy refused to recognize the \"unconstitutional\" vote, in which 90 percent of Catalan voters chose independence, according to Catalan officials, but just 40 percent of registered voters took part . Thousands of residents of Barcelona took to the streets for days of protests and work strikes . That included FC Barcelona , which halted all sports activities on Oct. 3, two days after it was forced to play a game \"behind closed doors\" \u2014 meaning no fans in attendance \u2014 as police clashed with separatist protesters outside. Young people gather in the aftermath of a general strike called on Oct. 3, 2017 to protest the violence of the National Police during the referendum for an independent Catalonia. About 300,000 people took part. Guillaume Pinon/NurPhoto via Getty Images \nFor the people of Catalonia, who have chafed under Spanish rule for centuries, the team is a living symbol of Catalan pride, and inter-league rivalries with teams like Real Madrid can feel like mini civil wars played out on the soccer pitch. \nHometown crowds at Camp Nou stadium in Barcelona often break into cries of \" Independencia! \" at the 17 minute 14 second mark , as they did during a 2012 game against Real Madrid, shown below. The year 1714 was the date that Catalonia lost its last great war of independence against the Kingdom of Castille. \nIronically, the team that is so closely linked with Catalan identity was actually founded by a foreigner, Swiss-born Hans Gamper , in 1899 with the support of Swiss, German and British expats, plus some local footballers. In its early years, FC Barcelona was mostly known for signing foreign players, while its crosstown rival, Espanyol, was fielded almost exclusively by Catalan players. \nBut the role of Bar\u00e7a as Catalonia's \"national\" team was cemented during the political upheaval leading to the Spanish Civil War in 1936. In 1935, a wealthy Catalan lawyer and politician named Josep Sunyol was elected president of the Futbol Club Barcelona. As a prominent leftist political figure in Catalonia, Sunyol was an ardent advocate of using football to forward the cause. Years earlier, he founded a Barcelona newspaper La Rambla, with the motto \" Esport i Ciutadania\" or \"Sports and Citizenship\" and wrote scathing editorials attacking the right-wing government in Madrid. \nWhen the Spanish Civil War broke out between pro-Republic leftists and the fascist forces led by General Francisco Franco, Sunyol stood his political ground as president of FC Barcelona. Several players joined the ranks of the leftists. In August 1936, Sunyol and some compatriots drove to the front in the Sierra de Guadarrama mountains to show support for the Republican fighters, but accidentally crossed into enemy territory . When they greeted a fascist military checkpoint with a cry of \" Viva la Republica! \" they were pulled from the car and killed on the spot. \n\"Sunyol's death is now seen as the truly defining moment of the club, the desecration of an ideology in bud, of cultural separatism, independence, the right to autonomy,\" writes Phil Ball in \" Morbo: The Story of Spanish Football .\" \nThe fascists won the Civil War and Franco was installed as a military dictator who ruled from Madrid, ruthlessly determined to purify Spain as a Castilian nation. The Catalan language was banned \u2014 as was Euskera, the Basque language to the west \u2014 as well as any public celebrations of Catalan culture, food, dance, art and history. With the martyrdom of Sunyol fresh in their memories, the people of Catalonia threw all their national pride behind FC Barcelona. \nAfter the Civil War, writes Ram\u00f3n Spaaj in \" Understanding Football Hooliganism ,\"\"FC Barcelona became the symbol of an oppressed nation.\" Its fans even lashed out at local Barcelona rivals Espanyol, who had taken to spelling their name \"Espa\u00f1ol\" in the Castilian style, which was \"hugely provocative,\" writes Spaaj. \nWhether Espanyol deserved it or not, its players and fans were accused by the Bar\u00e7a faithful as being functionaries of the fascist centralist government in Madrid. \n\"Despite their geographical proximity, Espanyol and FC Barcelona have come to symbolize two diametrically opposed social, cultural and political conceptions,\" writes Ball, \"Catalanism versus Anti-Catalanism, Anti-Spanishness versus Spanishness, and integration versus non-integration.\" \nThe passion of the separatist protesters taking to the streets of Barcelona is undeniable, but it's unclear whether Catalonia will successfully break from Spain, or what place it would have as Europe's youngest nation. It's also unclear what effect Catalan independence would have on FC Barcelona, which plays in La Liga, the highly competitive (and tremendously lucrative) Spanish pro football league. If Barcelona is no longer part of Spain, can they still play in the Spanish league? \nAt a press conference Wednesday, FC Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu said that if independence is won, the board of directors would consider moving the team to one of Europe's other top leagues, like the Premier League in the U.K., adding , \"This situation does not exist so far... It would be something to analyze calmly.\" \nThe club is also going to be one of the 11 \" non-political organizations \" that will be part of a commission to resolve the issues between Catalan leaders and the Spanish government. But at this point, it's difficult to know how the political standoff will end. Now That's Cool FC Barcelona really is more than a football club. It also fields basketball, handball and roller hockey teams, among other sports. It's the second-richest football team in the world and, unlike most pro soccer clubs, is owned by its supporters.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T00:13:54.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ed0362625f04a5922900280b84610e6b8aa8ea80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOqks75rrC4EbmpM_Cnxw.qp8.5vpjnN.i1lE3vBhGheon2sCI.pH3qgdOzPa_YyxZJ1mWw1qKkDvcLhKeHaAPR_ZJmOZ5VFe1w-", "site_full": "science.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW?type%5b%5d=article&type%5b%5d=list&type%5b%5b=quiz", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "How the Navy Comfort Ship Is Aiding Puerto Rico", "title_full": "How the Navy Comfort Ship Is Aiding Puerto Rico", "published": "2017-10-05T23:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/Navy-Comfort-Ship1.jpg", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 403, "comments": 0, "shares": 403}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ed0362625f04a5922900280b84610e6b8aa8ea80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOqks75rrC4EbmpM_Cnxw.qp8.5vpjnN.i1lE3vBhGheon2sCI.pH3qgdOzPa_YyxZJ1mWw1qKkDvcLhKeHaAPR_ZJmOZ5VFe1w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cherise Threewitt", "published": "2017-10-05T23:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "How the Navy Comfort Ship Is Aiding Puerto Rico", "text": "How the Navy Ship Comfort Is Aiding Puerto Rico by Cherise Threewitt POSTED Oct 5, 2017 The U.S. Naval Hospital Ship Comfort is seen in the Port of San Juan as it arrives to help after Hurricane Maria swept through the island on Oct. 3, 2017 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Joe Raedle/Getty Images \nAs President Donald Trump implied, hurricane relief is more difficult on an island . Fortunately, the U.S. military is prepared to offer medical help and other emergency assistance when those in need are located in the middle of \"a very big ocean.\" Oftentimes that assistance comes in the form of one of the United States' two largest hospital ships: the USNS Comfort, which arrived in Puerto Rico on Oct. 3, 2017, and its sister ship, the USNS Mercy. \nMercy is stationed in San Diego and typically serves missions in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Comfort, which is stationed in Norfolk, Virginia, (and therefore closer to Puerto Rico), often serves that region. But the priority of both ships is the same: to provide medical care in times of war. When they're not needed to care for military forces, they are deployed to aid in disaster relief \u2014 like the Comfort's current mission to Puerto Rico \u2014 and other humanitarian assignments. \nIt takes about five days for each ship to get fully staffed and ready for a deployment. That's because the ships carry a lot of people and equipment. Each one is equipped to provide full hospital services and includes 12 fully functioning operating rooms, two oxygen-producing facilities, digital radiology and CAT-scan services, a medical laboratory, an optometry lab, a full pharmacy and 1,000 hospital beds. The ships are staffed with crews of 1,215 medical personnel and 65 mariners. How USNS Comfort Can Help \nBefore the Comfort was deployed, about half of Puerto Rico's residents had no access to drinking water, and the electrical system was knocked completely offline after being decimated by Category 5 Hurricane Maria on Sept. 20, 2017. There are 69 hospitals on the island, but only 21 of them were able to provide any services at all. That means access to medical treatment was limited to those with the most critical needs, and then, only if the necessary tools or medicines were available. \nAnd almost immediately after arriving, the ship began receiving patients. On Oct. 4, five critical patients from Ryder Memorial Hospital in Humacao, Puerto Rico were medevaced by the Navy's Sea Knights Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron and Army Black Hawk helicopters after the hospital's generator failed. \n\"Working with the Army and the hospital, we were able to reduce transport times for critically ill patients,\" Lt. Cmdr. Christopher \"Harm\" Perry, said in a statement . Perry is an emergency physician and naval aviator aboard the Comfort and helped with the patients. \"This is the mission we have all been training for.\" U.S. Navy Sailors on the Comfort prepare to move a simulated battle casualty onto a gurney during a mass casualty drill as part of the ship's weeklong Comfort Exercise (COMFEX) in 2016. U.S. Navy photograph by Bill Mesta \nThe decision to deploy the Comfort to Puerto Rico was made near the end of September, about a week after Hurricane Maria passed through the region. One of the ship's biggest benefits \u2014 its size \u2014 ultimately became a drawback. A Pentagon spokesperson told The Washington Post that the ship wasn't sent sooner because of concerns that it was too big for the Puerto Rico's ports, which were heavily damaged in the storm. The Comfort has already demonstrated its value in disaster relief numerous times, including visits to New Orleans in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina, and Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. \nThe time it takes these massive ships to deploy can be a big problem, too, but in many ways, they do provide the best options for transporting emergency medical services and equipment that needs to be unloaded in the aftermath of major catastrophes. The arrival of the Comfort in Puerto Rica means that those most in need of medical assistance now have access to highly trained medical personnel, necessary equipment and a sterile working environment for safe treatment. Who Else Is on Board? \nJoe Messere is a Navy veteran and an administrator at Team Rubicon, a non-governmental organization (NGO) of veterans that provides disaster relief. He says during deployments like the Comfort ship's mission to Puerto Rico, the hospital staff consists entirely of active duty U.S. Navy doctors, nurses and corpsmen, and the ship's crew is all full-time government employees of Military Sealift Command (MSC). \nIn addition to the Comfort, government agencies and nonprofits have been working together to help Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria. The Navy , Coast Guard and U.S. Maritime Service had already deployed ships full of personnel and supplies; and Army Black Hawk helicopters and Air Force jets were able to get there even more quickly. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is there to coordinate the disaster response and lend a hand. \nCivilians groups also contribute to the relief efforts by working with NGOs like Team Rubicon, which specializes in disaster mitigation and recovery. Team Rubicon currently has volunteers assisting with Hurricane Maria (though not aboard the Comfort). Now That's Interesting The USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy were both converted from oil tankers. Since the ships travel around the world to care for injured soldiers, they occasionally end up in some very dangerous areas. Thus, the ships are armed with weapons that are to be used only if they need to defend themselves from attack. The ships rely on the Geneva Convention , which states that it is a war crime to attack hospital ships and their lifeboats.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T00:13:57.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3fadd24c47f0f3ab9b8d73b9c2fc82dd4d4269ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOqks75rrC4EbmpM_Cnxw.qp8.5vpjnN.i1ju5dc9Kap.ck1weoK_gqCGZ2ofDNymoNKVAp2lI.hP4_VK9wOWqLZlX_NODT20jQ-", "site_full": "science.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW?type%5b%5d=article&type%5b%5d=list&type%5b%5b=quiz", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "What Is a Bump Fire Stock?", "title_full": "What Is a Bump Fire Stock?", "published": "2017-10-05T22:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/bumpstock-1.jpg", "performance_score": 7, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 739, "comments": 0, "shares": 739}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3fadd24c47f0f3ab9b8d73b9c2fc82dd4d4269ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOqks75rrC4EbmpM_Cnxw.qp8.5vpjnN.i1ju5dc9Kap.ck1weoK_gqCGZ2ofDNymoNKVAp2lI.hP4_VK9wOWqLZlX_NODT20jQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Patrick J.

Kiger POSTED Oct 5, 2017 A bump stock device fits on a semi-automatic rifle to increase the firing speed, making it similar to a fully automatic rifle. George Frey/Getty Images \nOn Sunday, Oct. 1, a country music festival in Las Vegas became the scene of a mass killing when a gunman positioned in a high-rise hotel began shooting at concertgoers. At least 58 died, and more than 500 others were injured before the shooter took his own life, according to Las Vegas TV station KXNT. During the attack, the shooter, later identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, at one point managed to fire nearly 90 rounds in just 10 seconds, according to a New York Times analysis of audio posted on social media. \nThe speed of that bullet barrage led some to assume that the killer used a fully automatic firearm , a type of gun that automatically reloads after a shot is fired, fires again, and repeats the process as long as the trigger remains depressed. With the Firearm Owners' Protection Act of 1986, Congress banned the sale of new fully automatic firearms, but ones produced before that date are still obtainable, after the purchaser goes through an FBI background check. The gap between the stock and the main body of the rifle allows for the weapon to move, or \"bump,\" back and forth between the user's shoulder and trigger finger, increasing the rate of fire. George Frey/Getty Images \nBut the Las Vegas killer didn't need a fully automatic weapon to unleash his rapid-fire terror. In a Wednesday, Oct. 4, press conference, Jill Snider, Special Agent in Charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) San Francisco office, said that when authorities reached the gunman's hotel room, they found an arsenal that included 12 semi-automatic rifles equipped with after-market attachments called bump fire stocks. As Snider explained, the devices are designed to simulate automatic fire, without mechanically altering the function of a rifle in a way that would make it illegal under current federal law. \nAs The Truth About Guns , a popular gun blog, explains, a bump fire stock basically replaces the rigid standard stock on a rifle. Unlike the standard stock, the bump fire stock has a small amount of space that allows the rest of the rifle to move back and forth. That way the recoil causes the gun to bump the trigger against the shooter's finger, increasing the speed of firing. As this discussion thread on the gun-enthusiasts website AR15.com explains, it's possible to get a similar effect by holding the rifle at waist level. \nThough they increase the lethal potential of a gun and replicate a now illegal-to-possess firearm, the bump stocks themselves do not violate the current law. A 2010 letter produced by the ATF explains that one bump-fire device that was evaluated was found to be a legal firearm part, and therefore not regulated under the act. \nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has introduced a bill that would ban devices designed to allow a semiautomatic weapon to simulate full-auto speed. According to CNBC , even some Republican members of Congress, generally reluctant to enact firearm regulation, are now willing to consider such a ban in the wake of the Las Vegas shootings; both the White House and the National Rifle Association have indicated an openness to considering more regulation. Now That's Interesting A standard fully automatic weapon like a pre-1986 Colt AR-15 can fire 100 shots in about seven seconds, according to the New York Times analysis , while a semi-automatic AR-15-style assault rifle of the kind used in the June 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, fires 24 shots in 9 seconds. The bump stock used in Las Vegas more than triples the capability of the latter.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T00:13:58.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7fe646f02902ddeebf229f57d62ef30d62c1b816", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApumSbbEoOUoUbW7TYBSp0S7FnL2BGsh081RuxqHdAEBwMkhmMe0n4GRegdB_BxwxG2KefgkIzp6dVdJwshvKeYO", "site_full": "money.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/money", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Business & Money | HowStuffWorks", "title": "Could a Corporation Have Its Own Entire City?", "title_full": "Could a Corporation Have Its Own Entire City?", "published": "2017-10-06T19:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/amazoncorporate-1.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 259, "comments": 1, "shares": 259}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7fe646f02902ddeebf229f57d62ef30d62c1b816", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApumSbbEoOUoUbW7TYBSp0S7FnL2BGsh081RuxqHdAEBwMkhmMe0n4GRegdB_BxwxG2KefgkIzp6dVdJwshvKeYO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Laurie L.

Dove POSTED Oct 6, 2017 Could this Amazon corporate office building in Sunnyvale, California, provide a template for an entire city in Georgia? Lisa Werner/Moment Editorial/Getty Images \nEverything, apparently, has its price \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even cities. \nThroughout the United States, there are stadiums, sports arenas and streets named after private companies, but the ultimate in branding may come in the form of a new city named Amazon. Yes, named for that Amazon \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the online retail and cloud services juggernaut currently looking for a home for its second U.S. headquarters. \nOfficials in Stonecrest, Georgia, a city with a population of about 35,000, are attempting to convince Amazon to build its second headquarters on 345 acres (140 hectares) of open space within Stonecrest city boundaries. If Amazon accepts, the space will be parlayed into an entirely new city named Amazon and will become the corporation 's own city within a city, contend council members. \nThe idea is part of a proposal Stonecrest officials have put together to lure Seattle-based Amazon to the metropolitan Atlanta area, a move that would create about 50,000 jobs expected to pay an average of $100,000 each. \n\"There are several major U.S. cities that want Amazon, but none have the branding opportunity we are now offering this visionary company,\" Stonecrest Mayor Jason Lary told Atlanta NBC news station 11Alive. \"How could you not want your 21st-century headquarters to be located in a city named Amazon?\" \nIf the Amazon deal goes through, the creation of the Amazon city would require the approval of the state's legislature. And if you're worried about a company creating its own techno-corporate police squads and enforcing its own laws, we're not there yet; the Amazon city would likely rely on an operating agreement with Stonecrest and Dekalb County to provide services ranging from sewer and water to police and fire protection. It is expected that the legislative approval would require the Amazon city to be subject to the same municipal, county and state laws as every other locale in the state. But this could also offer the company a way to get creative with local taxation. \nAs disturbing as it may seem to have a corporate city, the private/public lines have been blurred before. A New Mexico city called Hot Springs agreed to change its name in the 1950s after a popular television game show wanted a city to rename itself in honor of its 10th anniversary. City officials voted to switch the town's name from Hot Springs to Truth or Consequences , on April 1, 1950. \nIn the 1990s, Halfway, Oregon, temporarily became Half.com to receive corporate cash for the renaming. Topeka, Kansas, briefly was called ToPikachu during the Pokemon craze of the late 1990s, and in 2011 spent several months officially named Google in a bid to attract a high-speed internet project. Now That's Interesting Think branding an entire city with a retail name is extreme? To lure the Amazon HQ committee's attention, Tucson, Arizona, delivered a live, 21-foot (6.4-meter) Saguaro cactus to Amazon's executive team. (The gift was rejected .)

David Becker/Getty Images \nA mall. A church. A nightclub. These are now what we know as \"soft targets.\" Not that long ago soft target was one just a term used by military, federal or police operations. But it's, sadly, entered everyday terminology. These soft targets are considered any public place where security is limited and are potentially populated by a high number of victims. \n\"Active shooter\" is another head-shaker in today's lexicon: Its definition is someone with a gun or guns, trying to kill as many people as possible \u2014 a mass shooting. And these shootings seem to be happening more often in the U.S., and in places that are considered safe. A movie theater. A sporting event. A music festival. \nAnd that's where the latest shooter took aim. He booked a hotel room in Las Vegas overlooking the Route 91 Harvest festival, and killed 58 people and injured hundreds more on Oct. 1, 2017 in what was apparently a methodically designed plan . \nEven though the chances of dying in a mass shooting (a shooting where four or more are killed at once) are low \u2014 just one in 15,325 according to a data analysis by Business Insider \u2014 staying vigilant when visiting these so-called soft targets, especially if the unthinkable happens, could save your life. 1. Stay Alert \nFirst of all, it's important to be prepared. Not paranoid and not terrified, says Paul Merritt, owner of Fortress Consulting , which specializes in helping businesses guard themselves against active-shooter situations. \"You can't walk around thinking the sky is going to fall,\" he says. But be prepared. \n\"First of all, these [shootings] are extremely rare occurrences,\" Merritt says. \"But understand: Things do happen and can happen.\" \nThis is actually the important first step in maintaining your safety. Once you come to grips with the idea that you might one day find yourself in an active-shooter situation, Merritt says, you take precautions. Merritt likens preparing for an active-shooter situation to fire drills. Yes , fires exist. No , you are not likely to die in a fire. Still, it's smart to be prepared for what to do should a fire break out in your home or office building. 2. Always Be Situationally Aware \nWhen you fly on a plane, for instance, flight attendants tell you where the exits are located. Do the same when you're at the mall or the movie theater. Look around as you shop or before the movie begins. Where are the exits? Where did you come in? Having an idea of your location will come in handy if a worst-case scenario unfolds. 3. Deny Denial \nMerritt says one of the most common responses from people when they hear gunfire? \"They assume it's fireworks,\" he says. \"But that's denial kicking in.\" If you think about it, there are very few places in which you will encounter fireworks . A crowded soft target is not one of them. Assume it's gunfire, and make your next decision. 4. Move and Create Distance \nMany of the helpless victims at the Las Vegas music festival could do little but duck or lie down. They had no choice. But Merritt maintains this is an anomaly. In most shootings, people have room to run or hide. First note where the gunfire is coming from , and move as quickly as possible in the opposite direction, toward the nearest exit (that you previously noticed). \nDo not lie down, if at all possible. \"It makes you an easily available target for the shooter,\" Merritt says. \"Create distance from the bad guy ... A moving target is harder to hit.\" If you cannot move quickly, find the nearest hiding place. \"Get out of the view of the shooter,\" Merritt says. And silence your cell phone. Text people, instead, to let them know your location and whether you need help getting to safety. 5. Leave and Keep Going \nOnce you've removed yourself from danger, run and don't stop going. Call 911 , but keep moving until you are completely out of the area. If you can help others without endangering yourself, do so. If you can't leave and are stuck in a hiding place that is safe, stay there until authorities arrive. This could take minutes or hours, but stay hidden. \nMerritt offers one last piece of advice, and it's another head-shaking reminder of the times we live in: Learn to use a tourniquet . You never know when you'll be called upon to use this skill. \nStories have emerged from Las Vegas, and other shootings, in which proper application of a tourniquet stopped or slowed a victim's bleeding \u2014 and it saved someone's life.

Bob Riha/WireImage/Getty Images \nWe are living in the golden age of in-flight movies. If you're old enough to recognize the sound of a dial-up modem, then you remember how movies were once reserved for only long flights. One movie, for the entire plane , shown on bulky monitors hanging down every 10 rows and censored so severely you were lucky to salvage a comprehensible plot. \nBut today \u2014 oh, today! \u2014 the in-flight entertainment choices are phenomenal. Thanks to on-board servers and broadband connectivity, you can stream new-release and classic movies, watch live TV, browse music channels, play video games and read ebooks \u2014 not only on the seatback screen, but on your own laptop, tablet or smartphone. \nBut with the explosion of in-flight entertainment choices comes a new twist on an old dilemma. When you turn every seatback and iPad into a movie screen, how do you make sure that potentially offensive content \u2014 graphic violence, nudity and culturally insensitive gags \u2014 isn't thrust in the faces of kids or the unsuspecting passenger in the middle seat? \nYou do what the entertainment industry and airlines have always done; you censor them. For the biggest blockbuster movies, studios themselves create an \"airline version,\" which is scrubbed of the bloodiest violence, the steamiest love scenes, as well as any references to plane crashes or terrorists. But there's also a booming cottage industry of in-flight entertainment content companies whose job is to edit and distribute customized versions of Hollywood movies to suit the tastes and taboos of different international markets. Passengers watch the first-ever film shown on an airplane during flight in 1929. Hulton-Deutsch Collection/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images Sex, Violence and Pork \nAmir Samnani is senior vice president of content services for Global Eagle, the market leader in providing both in-flight content and streaming technology for airlines serving every corner of the globe. Samnani says that the in-flight movie-editing business is all about matching the content of the movie with the culture of the airline. \n\"You can get away with a lot of stuff on European carriers, because the countries they represent aren't as culturally conservative compared to other regions in the world, like Indonesia or the Middle East,\" says Samnani. \"Those [other] airlines are a little more conservative.\" \nJovita Toh, CEO of Encore Inflight Limited, told CNN that while Europeans might be open to seeing more skin, gory violence turns them off. In the Middle East, it's sexual language and nudity that must be scrubbed, while Singapore travelers don't want to see anything that alludes to homosexuality. Toh also said that airlines serving majority Muslim countries ask to edit out mentions of \"pork\" or \"pigs\" in subtitles. \nSamnani at Global Eagle says that he's never been asked to cut out shots of bacon or sausage from a movie, but his team is definitely on the lookout for any dialogue or sight gags that make fun of a particular religion. \n\"Airlines fly all over the world nowadays,\" says Samnani. \"You can't say or show something that portrays that you're insulting a religion or a faith group or any country or any culture.\" \nLanguage in general is not as big of an issue, says Samnani, because in-flight audio is played through headphones, not broadcast through the whole cabin. Still, pretty much all airlines draw the line at the \"C-word,\" he says. \nThere are no U.S. or international laws that spell out exactly what can or cannot be shown on in-flight entertainment screens. Instead, there's an industry trade group called APEX \u2014 Airline Passenger Experience Association \u2014 that works with movie distributors and airlines to establish general guidelines for in-flight content, but most censoring decisions are left to the discretion of individual carriers. (The 2015 film \"Carol\" about a lesbian couple in the 1950s was heavily edited for viewing on Delta flights but not on United or American Airlines. Delta said it took the edited version it received from the movie studio and doesn't have the rights to request some edits and not others.) How Streaming Changed the Rules \nIn 2007, a pair of U.S. congressmen introduced the Family-Friendly Flights Act , which aimed to shield young children from violence and nudity in in-flight movies by creating \"child-safe viewing areas\" on planes where any movie rated beyond G couldn't be played. The legislation was never passed and no similar bills have been proposed since. \nCompared to the old in-flight entertainment systems, the new streaming technology gives passengers a tremendous amount of control. And that element of personal choice, says Samnani, takes some pressure off of the airlines to police content. \n\"The airlines are a little bit more lenient when it comes to streaming,\" Samnani says. \"What the airlines are doing now, before the movie starts, they have a little disclaimer. They'll say, 'This movie has some unsuitable content \u2014 nudity or language.' And then you as the passenger have to say yes, I still want to watch it. You're clicking, you're choosing something to watch.\" \nOne film expert checked the running times of movies shown on two major airlines (Virgin and Air Canada) and found that two-thirds were the same length as the theatrical presentation, while 14 percent were shorter, which gives you an idea of how many in-flight movies are cut. Intriguingly 21 percent were longer \u2014 most likely due to the \"director's cut\" or some other version made for home viewing being shown. Now That's Cool The very first in-flight movie \u2014 a newsreel and two cartoons \u2014 was shown on Oct. 8, 1929 on a Transcontinental Air Transport flight. Regular in-flight movie service didn't begin until the early 1960s, but good luck seeing the screen through all the cigarette smoke.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dave roos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pork  amir samnani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samnani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jovita toh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "transcontinental air transport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images sex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global eagle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american airlines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "encore inflight limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "airline passenger experience association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "air canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virgin america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T22:43:13.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d51a061f5f044877c053858fabc9954774ececa4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWaiqtttk4feTfT8qQSEUWmRnIGQhFW.nELxcNrDDoKJHUH2tWFJ2NNBVpekjtNaml8dXgWEbWiOc.8bih4wdr61HLuIarImgpuuRpnG.u2DcIJ1QV2JI6xla9Z6_DnVMDc-", "site_full": "history.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "A City in South Dakota Boasts a Life-size Statue of Every US President", "title_full": "A City in South Dakota Boasts a Life-size Statue of Every US President", "published": "2017-10-06T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/cityofpresidents-3.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 526, "comments": 0, "shares": 526}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d51a061f5f044877c053858fabc9954774ececa4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWaiqtttk4feTfT8qQSEUWmRnIGQhFW.nELxcNrDDoKJHUH2tWFJ2NNBVpekjtNaml8dXgWEbWiOc.8bih4wdr61HLuIarImgpuuRpnG.u2DcIJ1QV2JI6xla9Z6_DnVMDc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jesslyn Shields", "published": "2017-10-06T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "A City in South Dakota Boasts a Life-size Statue of Every US President", "text": "A City in South Dakota Boasts a Life-size Statue of Every US President by Jesslyn Shields POSTED Oct 6, 2017 President Harry S.

Lee Stockton/Flickr/ CC BY-ND 2.0 \nThere's nothing like a little public art to tell the rest of the world exactly what your community stands for. Liverpool, England, for instance, is covered in miniature replicas of the city's hulking Superlambanana sculpture. That's artist Taro Chiezo's 8-ton (7.3-metric ton), 17-foot (5.2 meter) lamb-banana hybrid which has been reminding tourists and residents alike of the creepy aspects of genetic engineering since 1998, while also memorializing the city's most historically significant imports. And Athens, Georgia, a town famous for its fanatical devotion to its local college football team, the Georgia Bulldogs, has dozens of flashily painted bulldog statues on permanent display to remind residents who might have forgotten that SEC football is really, really, really important. \nThe City of Rapid City, South Dakota, however, decided to forego capturing mere local flavor in its public art. Although this city of about 70,000 residents could have gotten some mileage out of the nearby Black Hills or their history as an Old West outpost, they decided to take on the theme of the entire American presidency . Let it never be said that the people of Rapid City are not ambitious. A sculpture of James Monroe in Rapid City, South Dakota, shows the country's fifth president tipping his top hat to passers-by, a nod to his reputation as a cordial man. Christian Heeb/AWL Images/Getty Images \nGranted, Mount Rushmore National Memorial is just 26 miles (42 kilometers) southwest of Rapid City, so the whole area has a bit of a patriotic vibe \u2014 there's even a presidential wax museum in nearby Keystone, South Dakota. \nBut in 2000, the \"City of Presidents\" project was born, the brainchild of Rapid City businessman and furniture manufacturer Don Perdue. He decided to honor the American presidency by commissioning life-sized bronze sculptures of all past American presidents , and placing them on every downtown street corner. To fund the project, Perdue started the City of Presidents Foundation , which has raised more than $2 million so far. This money goes towards the creation and installation of each sculpture \u2014 each one costs about $50,000. \nThe curators of the projects have worked to focus on the American presidency, humanizing the individuals in the office and not focusing on their politics. No political party or president is highlighted or given preferential treatment in the layout of the exhibit, and the five South Dakota artists (John Lopez, Lee Leuning and Sherri Treeby, James Michael Maher, Edward Hlavka, and James Van Nuys) who have created the existing sculptures have done exhaustive research on each president to find out what made the guy \u2014 and yes, so far all guys \u2014 tick. \n\"All of the sculptures are really intricate \u2014 all the presidents are recognizable because they're doing things they liked to do,\" says Michelle Thomson, the president of Black Hills and Badlands Tourism Association . \nAnd the presidents certainly are humanized on the streets of Rapid City. They're installed right at street level, so visitors can mosey up to their favorite commander-in-chief and look him right in the face \u2014 or sit in his lap. Ronald Reagan, Calvin Coolidge, and Teddy Roosevelt are pretty casual, duded up in their Western gear, while Millard Fillmore and Martin Van Buren look as if they might be having a nice Sunday morning lounge with some favorite reading material. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd president, appears before microphones delivering his famous \"date which will live in infamy\" speech. The Dec. 8, 1941, speech, delivered in front of a joint session of Congress, took place the day after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor; the United States officially declared war against Japan less than an hour after Roosevelt's speech. jpellgen/Flickr/ CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 \nJohn F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln are deep in conversation with their young sons while George W. Bush and Gerald Ford pose with their dogs. Richard Nixon sits with his fingers tented, staring intensely into the middle distance, apparently plotting world domination. Everybody has their thing. \nThe presidents have been wildly popular with tourists, thousands of whom check in at the visitor's center each year, grab a map and take the presidential walking tour. \n\"The project has been a huge benefit to Rapid City,\" says Thomason. \"Visitors love it and it's spurred other development downtown aimed at drawing visitors. Locals even put hats and scarves on the presidents during the winter months for people in need.\" \nAll 43 past presidents are now accounted for in downtown Rapid City, with the exception of Barack Obama, whose statue is currently in the works but will feature a smiling Obama in a walking pose. Donald Trump will get his after he leaves office. Lyndon B. Johnson was the 36th president; a statue of him in Rapid City, South Dakota, depicts him leaning against a lectern, a reference to his refusal to debate his 1964 opponent Barry Goldwater.

Tom M Johnson/Getty Images \nBefore the 1970s, homosexuality was often considered a mental illness . Indeed, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) classified it as such in its first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published in 1952. This was not a controversial position at the time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it held with prevailing norms. But then gay activists started protesting at annual meetings of the APA, and presented scientific evidence opposing this view. \nIn 1973, it was put to the vote and the majority (58 percent) of APA members agreed homosexuality should no longer be considered a mental disorder [source: Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry ]. This change was a huge step for gay rights and helped to shift societal thinking on homosexuality. It also demonstrated the power of the DSM, the diagnostic manual of the APA, on public opinion. \nKeep Reading Below \nNow in its fifth edition and known as DSM-5 (this is the first edition without a Roman numeral), the publication does not offer treatment or medication advice for the 157 disorders described in its pages. Rather, it was designed to help healthcare professionals better identify and diagnose mental disorders, such as those that impact personality, cognition, mood and identity. The manual also provides uniform diagnostic codes for each issue, which are used to facilitate billing and data collection [source: APA ]. \nThe manual is primarily used in the United States, with much of the rest of the world's health professionals turning instead to the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Diseases (ICD) , which covers all diseases, not just those psychiatric in nature. APA encourages healthcare professionals to consider DSM-5 and ICD as \"companion publications,\" designed to be compatible with each other. \nSo how did it start? The DSM was developed in response to an obvious need for mental illness classification systems. The U.S. Census of 1840 took baby steps toward the eventual development of the manual when it added incidents of \"idiocy/insanity\" to its survey. This was possibly the first attempt at statistical information-gathering related to mental illness, and therefore a pretty big deal. In 1880, the Census fleshed out the mental health categories to include issues like dementia, melancholia, epilepsy and mania [source: APA ]. \nMental institutions of the past have been the stuff of horror movies, a fate sometimes worse than death for those who wound up behind their walls. Just a century ago, people were institutionalized for relatively common, now-treatable problems, like bipolar disorder [source: Mental Health America ]. Fortunately, mental illness detection, treatment and diagnosis, although still far from perfect, have come a long way. One of the measures credited with improving care quality was the development of the DSM. \nIn 1917, the American Medico-Psychological Association (the forerunner of the APA) and the National Commission on Mental Hygiene came up with a plan, adopted by the Census Bureau, for gathering uniform health statistics in mental hospitals. And in 1921 the APA started to develop psychiatric classifications for various severe psychiatric disorders. After World War II, the APA used a bigger classification system developed by the U.S. Army as it was treating veterans to develop the first DSM [source: APA] . 1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "statistical manual of mental disorders", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dsm", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mental health america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american psychiatric association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medico-psychological association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "advancement of psychiatry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "census bureau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national commission on mental hygiene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. army", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T01:03:09.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9598ddd6d2bad8bce4e4564d666a7fbd68e37ae1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyIQWXmo9DxhzXHkdl0J7WXMBMkX0XqgmpalbAoYggsYOwz7KOSNQxSQDbGqmvWOkSA1jFrgH3Xr8QeJznhZZjUIWkPZOhtXyJP.DOzy1SW8Pr8OhZUZJOe.ELcC_yFZYH0JRdpdQC00dE6yFF1zisF4GFYSRma2UEaF3SIEQpaX5kVHK_bQ0Ha", "site_full": "people.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "Cute, Courageous and Crazy: Our Best Stories You Might Have Missed This Week", "title_full": "Cute, Courageous and Crazy: Our Best Stories You Might Have Missed This Week", "published": "2017-10-06T23:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/Panda-cub-weeklywrapup.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 14, "comments": 0, "shares": 14}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9598ddd6d2bad8bce4e4564d666a7fbd68e37ae1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyIQWXmo9DxhzXHkdl0J7WXMBMkX0XqgmpalbAoYggsYOwz7KOSNQxSQDbGqmvWOkSA1jFrgH3Xr8QeJznhZZjUIWkPZOhtXyJP.DOzy1SW8Pr8OhZUZJOe.ELcC_yFZYH0JRdpdQC00dE6yFF1zisF4GFYSRma2UEaF3SIEQpaX5kVHK_bQ0Ha", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarah Gleim", "published": "2017-10-06T23:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cute, Courageous and Crazy: Our Best Stories You Might Have Missed This Week", "text": "Cute, Courageous and Crazy: Our Best Stories You Might Have Missed This Week by Sarah Gleim POSTED Oct 6, 2017 A panda cub is seen here sleeping in tree in Wolong valley resort at Wuyuan County, east China's Jiangxi Province.

So prepare yourselves, dear readers, for our newest, cutest and otherwise silliest stories that you missed this week. The Cute \nThere's no denying pandas are about the cutest things on earth. And thankfully, there's some good news for these adorable black-and-white bears: Their numbers continue to increase in the wild! So much so the cuddly bamboo-eating giant panda ( Ailuropoda melanoleuca ) is actually no longer considered \"endangered.\" In 2016, it was reclassified as \"vulnerable\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). But there's still work to do. The panda's habitat continues to shrink, and that puts these guys at risk. Read all about it here . The Courageous \nYou probably know about the Women's March on Washington in January 2017. But did you know that it was women that led a massive protest in October 1789 that ultimately changed the course of the French Revolution? That's right. Thousands of courageous protestors \u2014 mostly women \u2014 marched 12 miles (19.3 kilometers) from Paris to Versailles to demand King Louis XVI release the palace's grains to the people who were starving. You can find out more about the march \u2014 and its outcome \u2014 by reading about it here or listening to the Stuff You Missed in History podcast episode here . The Crazy \nWe have nothing against anyone who wants to get a little nip-and-tuck. But when a plastic surgeon starts turning his operating room into a social media circus, that's where we draw the line \u2014 and by circus, we mean doctors juggling breast implants while performing surgery live and broadcasting it online. These plastic surgery videos have gotten so out of control, apparently, that the American Society of Plastic Surgeons has written a code of ethics about what videos can be shared online.

JGI/Jamie Grill/Getty Images \nGetting healthy can be overwhelming in scope, which is one reason why many people abandon ship after a short period of effort. Fortunately, scientists have uncovered the secret to health success, and it's a lot less convoluted than you might think. In fact, simplicity is the very core message. \nA meta-analysis of 150 research reports , recently published in the journal Health Psychology Review, concluded that similarly focused messages are what matters when helping people stage a health intervention, like losing weight or quitting smoking. Success is more likely when the messages are not mixed with both action and inaction recommendations. For example, if a doctor tells a patient to engage in only inaction behaviors, like reducing fat intake or reducing screen time, that's more likely to work than telling him to engage in one action, like exercise more, along with one inaction, like eat less sugar. \n\"What we found is that it's better to combine them in a homogeneous way,\" said Dolores Albarracin, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois in a press release. \"If you tell people to engage in two behaviors and the behaviors are a mix of actions and inactions, it's likely that recipients will adhere less. It's easier to frame the recommendations along the same axis of action or inaction. You don't want to work against yourself or at cross-purposes with your message.\" \nAction-only recommendations (exercise more, eat more veggies) are also less confusing than mixed messages. Surprisingly, in the areas of exercise and diet, action messaging is less effective in the long run than inaction-focused recommendations. On the flip side, smoking-reduction efforts are more successful with action steps. \nThis guidance should be helpful for healthcare providers and groups trying to improve habits and behavior. \"In terms of organizational behavior, if you're trying to train people to execute a few different behaviors, it would be better to frame it this way rather than mix and match,\" Albarracin explains. \"If you're trying to create employee health programs, for example, think of it as one package. You don't want to overload people with information, but you also don't want to have a message that's at cross-purposes with itself.\" Now That's Scary Approximately 1 in 3 Americans today are considered obese, a huge shift from just a few decades ago. Why the change? Some possible causes are an uptick in affordable convenience foods, lowered physical demands on the job (and thus less exercise throughout the day) and more screen time than ever before.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alia hoyt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "albarracin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dolores albarracin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "health psychology review", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of illinois", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T20:19:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "76e232d3b10e0decaeb331d6d567a89beba95e8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWZJc1wsnJ_yFz9DQ.5KqEzjz7sf826DForJHTIqMwYt2I8GtIc47MlKHBdYny3FfWERDFIEUP8FAiuy2lu0jaOYI.0LFQQhakLZqMRGRHK2B92VNA1TwaJ4CCFQ4ykuIWPQLOXLJ8NMO_C0uEGRhUZu", "site_full": "health.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "Have Most Plastic Surgeons Had Surgery Themselves?", "title_full": "Have Most Plastic Surgeons Had Surgery Themselves?", "published": "2017-10-09T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/plasticsurgeonsurgery-2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 35, "comments": 0, "shares": 35}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "76e232d3b10e0decaeb331d6d567a89beba95e8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWZJc1wsnJ_yFz9DQ.5KqEzjz7sf826DForJHTIqMwYt2I8GtIc47MlKHBdYny3FfWERDFIEUP8FAiuy2lu0jaOYI.0LFQQhakLZqMRGRHK2B92VNA1TwaJ4CCFQ4ykuIWPQLOXLJ8NMO_C0uEGRhUZu", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Laurie L.

Dove POSTED Oct 9, 2017 \"Physician, heal thyself,\" goes the biblical proverb. Does the same standard apply for surgeons who handle elective cosmetic procedures? Peter Dazeley/Getty Images \nAt his San Diego office, Alex Roher, M.D., relaxes wrinkles and plumps deep lines one face at a time. For years, he's been administering vials of Botox and injectable fillers to patients eager to refresh their looks, but does the desire to look younger extend to industry professionals? Absolutely, Dr. Roher contends. \n\"Most plastic surgeons have gone under the knife,\" says Roher. \"The rate compared to the general public is much higher, from my experience.\" Cosmetic vs. Plastic Surgery \nBefore delving into the propensity of surgeons to undergo appearance-altering procedures , let's get a handle on the differences between cosmetic and plastic surgeons. Although \"cosmetic\" and \"plastic\" are terms often used interchangeably , they refer to two different levels of training. \nIn general, surgeons who follow the training and certification process to become a board certified plastic surgeon are required to complete 150 cosmetic surgery cases as part of a rotation that includes surgical training for hands, reconstruction, trauma, congenital defects and other disorders. Plastic surgeons repair cleft palates and revise scars, as well as reconstruct limbs and breasts after surgery. However, plastic surgeons can perform surgical and noninvasive procedures that are strictly cosmetic, too. In the United States, plastic surgeons undergo cosmetic procedures at a higher rate than the general population, according to research. Innocenti/Cultura RF/Getty Images \nCosmetic surgeons are focused on enhancing the appearance of a patient's face, neck or body with liposuction, tummy tucks, breast augmentations , facelifts and other cosmetic procedures . Cosmetic surgeries are considered elective, as are noninvasive procedures like laser resurfacing or Botox injections. To become board certified, cosmetic surgeons are required to complete 300 cosmetic surgery cases. Surgery Rates Among Surgeons \nSo, do most plastic or cosmetic surgeons elect to enhance their appearance? And, do they do so at a higher rate than the general public? \n\"Yes and yes,\" says Grant Stevens, M.D., fellow of the American College of Healthcare Executives, and a clinical professor of plastic surgery at the University of Southern California. \nThe results of a study published in the December 2009 Journal of Plastic Reconstructive Surgery seem to bear out this anecdotal evidence. The study found that, of the 276 plastic surgeons surveyed, a full one-third have had at least one type of cosmetic surgery, while Pew Research Center statistics show that of the general U.S. population, only 4 percent of adults say they've had cosmetic surgery. Of the surgeons who'd had surgery themselves, the most common surgical procedure (18.6 percent) was liposuction of the trunk and/or extremities. \nInterestingly, female plastic surgeons were less likely to have breast augmentation than the general population, but male plastic surgeons were more apt to have cosmetic procedures than men in the general population. It's a finding that holds true for Glenn Vallecillos, M.D., a board-certified plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills. \n\"I continuously maintain and enhance my current features with the noninvasive treatments offered throughout my practice,\" says Dr. Vallecillos. \"I will treat myself to a laser, yet other times I will ask one of my nurses to inject a little Botox.\" \nLike Dr. Vallecillos, 62 percent of the plastic surgeons in the 2009 study had undergone at least one type of minimally invasive cosmetic procedure, less serious than surgery. The most common procedure was Botox injections (31.5 percent), and female plastic surgeons had significantly more minimally invasive cosmetic procedures compared with male plastic surgeons (84.9 versus 57 percent). The Selfie Effect \nIn 2016, facial plastic surgeons reported an uptick in cosmetic surgeries by patients under 30, along with an increase in nonsurgical procedures, according to a member survey by the American Academy of Facial Plastics and Reconstructive Surgery. \nFifty-one percent of AAFPRS members reported that more patients are seeking early intervention, with increasing numbers of men and women in their 20s and 30s opting for facial injectables. \n\"The focus has shifted from correction to prevention,\" says Fred G. Fedok, M.D., president of the AAFPRS, in the report . \"Even before the first signs of sagging, lines or volume loss, we are seeing patients adamant about stalling the aging process.\" \nNearly all AAFPRS members \u00e2\u0080\u0094 99 percent \u00e2\u0080\u0094 agreed that celebrity influence plays a big role. And so does social media. According to AAFPRS members, the top driver for cosmetic procedures is the impact of social media; of participating surgeons, 42 percent reported that patients are seeking cosmetic procedures to look better in selfies on Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook Live and other social channels. \nThe second-most reported motivating factor for patients was the desire to remain \"relevant\" and \"competitive\" at work. Walking Billboards \nMany plastic surgeons are no different. They feel it's difficult to sell their services without looking like they've taken a dip in the fountain of youth themselves \n\"One of the benefits of treating myself is I'm a walking billboard of my own work,\" plastic surgeon Lorrie Klein, M.D., said in a 2015 interview with Real Self magazine. \"I'm proud of my artistry and like to show it off. What nature didn't give me or what age has taken away, I can frequently fix.\" Now That's Cool Where did the term \"plastic surgery\" originate? Ancient Greece, of course.

Jordan Siemens/Getty Images \nWe've just got to stop using so many fossil fuels; they're ruining everything . And while there is no silver bullet to dispatch all our climate problems, electric cars could be one way we can begin to cool it on the carbon dioxide emissions. But in order to make electric cars, we need to make electric car batteries that can store enough energy to run a car. And for that, we need lithium. \nBut the problem is, this light, silvery metal is becoming increasingly hard to come by. Most of the world's lithium supply comes from igneous rock deposits in Australia and salt flats in Chile. But as we continue mining those deposits to power our cellphones, laptops and power tools (and to manufacture things like nuclear weapons and psychiatric drugs), the possibilities of what we can do with lithium-ion batteries becomes more limited. We can't use what we can't find. Scientists have identified around 30-40 supervolcanoes globally, six to 10 of which are potentially active. Samosir Island, pictured here, sits within Lake Toba, a lake occupying the caldera of a supervolcano in Sumatra, Indonesia. laughingmango/Getty Images \nBut a recent study published in the journal Nature Communications suggests that researchers from Stanford University and the U.S. Geological Survey might have found a new source of lithium in North America's supervolcanoes. \nSounds exciting! But what does that mean? \nSupervolcanoes are volcanic features whose eruptions can be up to 10,000 times bigger than your average volcano in, say, Hawaii. They spew magma up to 240 cubic miles (1,000 cubic kilometers) in all directions and create massive calderas \u00e2\u0080\u0094 giant holes that gradually fill up with water over time. Crater Lake in Oregon is a great example of one of these lakes formed by a super-eruption that happened thousands of years ago. How does this potentially help us make batteries? Over tens of thousands of years, lithium from the volcanic deposits leeches out of the water that fills the basin, and the metal settles to the bottom, forming a clay called hectorite. \nThe research team looked at samples of rock from caldera sites in Nevada, Wyoming and Colorado, even comparing samples from similar sites in Mexico and Sicily, to determine exactly how much lithium we could expect to squeeze from an ancient supervolcanic rock. According to the researchers, the prospects are good. \n\"If you have a lot of magma erupting, it doesn't have to have as much lithium in it to produce something that is worthy of economic interest as we previously thought,\" said co-author Gail Mahood, a professor of geological sciences at Stanford's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences , in a press release . \"You don't need extraordinarily high concentrations of lithium in the magma to form lithium deposits and reserves.\" \nWhich is super, because lithium might be essential to humanity's energy future, and domestic sources of lithium could benefit the United States. \n\"We're going to have to use electric vehicles and large storage batteries to decrease our carbon footprint,\" Mahood said. \"It's important to identify lithium resources in the U.S. so that our supply does not rely on single companies or countries in a way that makes us subject to economic or political manipulation.\" Now That's Interesting", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jesslyn shields", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gail mahood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahood", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "stanford university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nature communications", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford's school of earth, energy & environmental sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. geological survey", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyoming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crater lake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lake toba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sicily", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sumatra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samosir island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T22:27:15.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2921d349e4b7bd1b7d4a6aeceda185744bac04ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApumSbbEoOUoUbW7TYBSp0S7rtJ6qeDrAq0bAq_n9fMPQ54jh9xT5V7NE9FBxUZg.yMtpbFRPhVlXzMhoCOxbSL.H78TeWo5dK0-", "site_full": "money.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW", "site_categories": ["telecommuting", "media", "jobs"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "Why Buy a Sports Jersey When You Can Rent One?", "title_full": "Why Buy a Sports Jersey When You Can Rent One?", "published": "2017-10-09T23:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/rent-jersey.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 35, "comments": 0, "shares": 35}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2921d349e4b7bd1b7d4a6aeceda185744bac04ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApumSbbEoOUoUbW7TYBSp0S7rtJ6qeDrAq0bAq_n9fMPQ54jh9xT5V7NE9FBxUZg.yMtpbFRPhVlXzMhoCOxbSL.H78TeWo5dK0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Melanie Radzicki McManus", "published": "2017-10-09T23:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Buy a Sports Jersey When You Can Rent One?", "text": "by Melanie Radzicki McManus POSTED Oct 9, 2017 Richard Sherman (No. 25) of the Seattle Seahawks signs autographs for fans after a 16-10 win over the Los Angeles Rams at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Oct. 8, 2017. Harry How/Getty Images \nNo one wants to shell out big bucks for a football jersey with someone's name on it that becomes obsolete when the player is traded to another team. Now, a new company says you don't have to. Rep the Squad sends you a different sports jersey whenever you like, allowing you to always show who you're rooting for on a given day. \nThe Seattle-based business works like Netflix did in the video business's early days. You go to the Squad's website and select a jersey you'd like to wear. The company ships it out and you keep it as long as you'd like. When you're ready for a new one, you mail the jersey back in the prepaid envelope. A few days later you'll receive a new shirt. The monthly fee for this service is $19.95. \nCurrently the company offers jerseys for players repping the Detroit Lions, San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks, but it plans to add other teams. The company also stocks retro jerseys and the jerseys of retired classic players. \nCompany founder Brian Watkins told the New York Daily News that because sports jerseys are pricey, most people can't afford to have an extensive collection of them. It's also a huge bummer when you pony up to buy your favorite player's jersey, and then he gets traded to another team. \nA little queasy about the idea of wearing a jersey someone may have spilled beer and wing sauce on? No worries. After a customer mails back a jersey, the company dry cleans it and someone personally inspects it before sending it out to the next user. But if you damage a jersey, you'll be billed. If you become attached to a particular shirt, you can purchase it from the company at a discounted price. \nRep the Squad plans to also cover other sports, including professional hockey, baseball and basketball. Jerseys for some NBA teams will be available in time for the 2018 season.

It's usually because of the odor. The smell of a ripe durian ( Durio zibethinus ) has been compared to sweaty socks, roadkill custard, rotten eggs, a gas leak and \"a sewer full of rotting pineapples,\" but still, the fruit has its superfans. \nAnd now some of those superfans from the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS) and Duke-NUS Medical School (along with some financial donors who just love durians enough to privately fund a study about them) have completely mapped the durian genome to find out, among other things, why the putrid stench, durians? \nIn the study , published in the journal Nature Genetics, the researchers sequenced the genome of a popular and prized durian variety called Musang King, and found its genome is made up of around 46,000 genes \u2014 just about double the number of genes that compose the human genome. They found the plant is closely related to both cotton and cacao \u2014 that's right, the chocolate plant. Durians are so smelly, and thescent can linger for so long, that many hotels and public transportation in Singapore and Malaysia ban the fruit. Danita Delimont/Gallo Images/Getty Images \nBut the researchers were really interested in the source of the smell, so in snooping around the genome for odor-producing compounds, they found a class of genes called MGLs (methionine gamma lyases) in the leaves, roots and fruits of durian plants. The researchers found that these genes regulate the synthesis of odor-producing volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). They also discovered that in the ripe fruit, the expression of one of these VSC-expressing genes is about 2,000 times stronger than it is in other parts of the plant. \n\"Our analysis revealed that VSC production is turbocharged in durian fruits, which fits with many people's opinions that durian smell has a 'sulphury' aspect,\" writes co-lead author professor Patrick Tan from Duke-NUS Medical School , in a press release . \nIn the wild, this aspect might be responsible for attracting seed-dispersing animals like elephants and bats to the durian fruit. \nThis isn't the first research conducted on the durian's unique scent; in 2012, a team of German researchers identified dozens of chemical compounds that create to combine the smell, publishing their analysis in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. But that research didn't investigate the genes behind those compounds. \nThe NCCS-Duke research team was hoping to make an important medical discovery with the sequencing of the Musang King genome \u2014 after all, anticancer drugs like Taxol , derived from the bark of the Pacific yew ( Taxus brevifolia ), save lives every day. And as biodiversity decreases all over the world, we need to figure out what we have while it's still around. But as durian enthusiasts, these scientists also just wanted to investigate how this quirky and controversial plant might be conserved. Besides D. zibethenus , there are around 30 other species of durian (both edible and inedible) in the Asian forests, and some of them are endangered. \n\"Many of these other durian species are in this part of the world, and sadly some are endangered due to the increasing loss of biodiversity,\" said co-lead author Dr. Teh Bin Tean, deputy director of the National Cancer Centre Singapore , in the press release. \"DNA sequencing is thus an important tool to protect the precious information contained in these fascinating and important plants.\" Now That's Interesting A single durian can weigh up to 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms).

There are even toy-based versions of superheroes, resulting in a perfect storm of merchandising. But while these fictional heroes seem unbelievable, there are actually real superpowers among everyday human beings. These powers are rare, but they can be exploited for their incredible abilities. \nThat's why Matt Frederick, Ben Bowlin and Noel Brown of Stuff They Don't Want You To Know think real-life superpowers are amazing, but also inherently dangerous. \nIn this episode of podcast , they start first saying superpowers are real. There are documented cases of human beings displaying amazing abilities such as an extremely detailed memory , seeing sound as color or even magnetism. Usually there is some genetic explanation: The people with magnetism seem to have a higher friction on their skin , making it attractive not only to metal but also glass, plastic and wood. \nLiam Hoekstra, the world's strongest kid , could do a pullup by the time he was 8 months old. His body wasn't producing myostatin, a gene that inhibits muscular growth. Without it, there is no limit to muscle development, leading to real-life super strength. \nOther superpowers heighten certain senses to an extreme degree. Synesthesia , common in many artists and musicians, is where experiencing one sense leads to experiencing another. (For example you might always \"see\" a certain letter as a certain color.) Many people with synesthesia also have chromesthesia , which enables them to see sound as color. \nSome superpowers can even be learned: Echolocation , for example, is the ability to sense where objects are in space by detecting how sound bounces off them. Bats and dolphins have this ability, and so do humans. Ben Underwood learned echolocation to play football, basketball, skateboard and rollerblade, all without the use of his eyes. People can also learn to regulate their body temperature through a method called tummo meditation. Wim Hof, aka \" The Iceman ,\" learned how and was able to climb Mount Everest wearing only shorts and shoes by employing tummo techniques to keep him warm. \nSo human beings are pretty cool! But here's the scary part: Where there are superheroes, there must also be supervillains. And many times, supervillains are organized. (Hail Hydra .) What happens when private entities, like pharmaceutical companies, have the technology to create and manufacture superpowers? \nThere are obvious concerns like super soldiers, but there are more insidious factors as well. You'll have to listen to the podcast to find out what the guys think those horrors could be.

Take the simple task of making breakfast: Would you rather make scrambled eggs while pondering your utility payments or, say, pretend you're a short-order cook tasked with making the World's Best Scrambled Eggs for a celebrity? Breakfast is a lot more interesting when there's something at stake. \nAccording to a recent study in the journal Child Development, kids are savvy to this trick. Aiming to test the benefits of self-distancing (viewing personal experiences from an outsider's perspective) on children's perseverance, the researchers asked 180 kids, ages 4 or 6, to do a pretty boring computer task for 10 minutes. Although all the kids had to do was press a key when they saw a certain image, they were told the task was important and that they had to be \"good helpers.\" They could take breaks to play a game on an iPad if they wanted. \nThe researchers split the kids split into three groups, and asked each to think about its performance on the given task from a certain perspective: self-immersed, third-person or exemplar. Kids in the self-immersed group asked themselves, \"Am I working hard?\" The third-person group reflected on the task by asking, \"Is [the child's name] working hard?\" And the exemplar group? Those children imagined they were either Batman, Bob the Builder, Rapunzel or Dora the Explorer \u2014 well-known characters who are model hard workers \u2014 and were given props to help them get in character. They were told to ask themselves, \"Is [whatever character was chosen] working hard?\" Every minute of the task, a recorded voice prompted the children with their allotted question. \nThe researchers found that the kids in both age groups who imagined themselves as a character spent a longer time on the task. (Although, predictably, the younger kids spent less time on the task than the older kids, across the board.) The 6-year-olds who were asked to reflect in first person spent about 35 percent of the time on the task rather than on break, and the 4-year-olds just over 20 percent. But the children pretending to be fictional heroes spent 55 percent of their time working, while the 4-year-olds in this group spent 32 percent of their time on task. \nThe researchers posit that when the children used third-person or impersonated characters, the kids distanced themselves from the boring task and tempting game, allowing them to gain more focus and self-control . \"Taking an outsider's perspective on one's own behavior can improve perseverance in the face of entertaining distractions,\" the researchers say in the study. \nBut interpreting these results is not so simple. Is pretending to be a character just fun? Does it make kids think like their powerful alter ego? The study authors say answering these questions will require more research. Regardless, the current study suggests that for kids, sticking to a task might be easier with role play.

Margo Silver/Getty Images \nEven the hardest of hearts are likely to be saddened by animal hoarding cases, which too often reveal sick, neglected and dead animals. This is not an uncommon occurrence, either. At least 700 and 2,000 animal hoarding cases are exposed every year in the United States alone, each of which may involve dozens, even hundreds of animals living in filthy conditions. Some experts have struggled with whether or not animal hoarding merits its own diagnosis, separate from object or general hoarding. Researchers from Brazil recently released a report in the journal Psychiatry Research that supports the creation of the separate diagnosis. \nThe group conducted field visits to the homes of 33 hoarders in Porto Alegre, Brazil. The average number of animals in each location was 41 , mostly cats and dogs \u2014 giving a total of 1,400 animals affected. The researchers talked at length to the subjects about their backgrounds, lifestyle and living situations. Analysis showed that 64 percent of them were elderly, 75 percent were low-income and 88 percent were not married. \nThese statistics jibe with what scientists currently believe to be true of general hoarders. Some major differences emerged, however. First, 73 percent of the animal hoarders were women, compared with what is generally a 50/50 split of general hoarders. Also, they appear to have different motivations for hoarding animals. \n\"They think they are like missionaries, that they are saving these [animals'] lives ... and that they are the only ones who can care for them,\" researcher Elisa Arrienti Ferreira told Science Magazine . \"When you speak to someone who is hoarding objects, they don't say things like that. Instead, they say they are keeping things because they think they might need them someday.\" \nAnd although the DSM (the diagnostic manual of the psychiatric profession) stated that most animal hoarders also hoarded objects, Ferreira found that to be true only half of the time. Most of those interviewed described a major traumatic event \u2014 like the death of a child as the catalyst for the animal hoarding. \nIn addition, \"The processes of disengaging from or donating animals also differ from those of object hoarding, since there is an affectional bond with lives and not with unanimated objects,\" the scientists write in the study . \"In this sense, the characterization of Animal Hoarding Disorder as a new mental disorder may arouse great interest from both clinical professionals and researchers.\" \nNot so fast, say some experts. Animal hoarding is accepted as a special manifestation of general, compulsive hoarding. However, it takes a huge amount of study for a new diagnosis to be created. \"It is premature to establish such a diagnosis,\" explains Dr. Gail Steketee, with the Boston University School of Social Work in an email interview. \"Although we have a working definition for animal hoarding, this has not yet been established through rigorous research and vetted through the psychiatric channels. We do not have comprehensive studies of those with the condition and corroborating information from professionals who treat them.\" \nMore in-depth study can't come fast enough for experts and those affected by animal hoarding, whether or not a new diagnosis is necessitated. \"The consequences of animal hoarding can be quite severe not only for the animals themselves, but anyone living nearby,\" says Smith College psychology professor Dr. Randy O. Frost in an email. \"It is not uncommon to find large numbers of sick and/or dying animals in homes that also threaten the health of any humans living there.\" \nFrost co-authored a paper comparing object and animal hoarders in 2011. It noted that because animals are legally considered property, it would seem that hoarding animals would qualify as hoarding disorder, with people who hoard objects displaying many similar characteristics to those who hoard animals. These include a need for control and intense emotional attachments to objects/animals, as well as not being aware they had a hoarding problem. There were also differences, one being that animal hoarders tended to live in very squalid conditions, which was true for only a small group of object hoarders. \nHowever, much is unknown. And Ferreira's study is pretty small. \n\"The fundamental conclusion is that we know so little about animal hoarding that it is hard to justify a new diagnosis,\" says Frost. \"There was great pressure to avoid creating new disorders when DSM-5 was put together [it was released in 2013]. One option that was considered was to include animal hoarding as a special subtype or specifier under hoarding disorder. It was concluded that there was simply not enough known about it to do so.\" Now That's Cool Serial animal hoarder Vikki Kittles was repeatedly busted for decades of animal abuse in Florida, Mississippi, Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Wyoming.

Donald Iain Smith/Getty Images \nTell a child they need to undergo another painful medical procedure, and you'll probably have a kid who's racked with fear and anxiety. Tell that same child they'll have a chance to zap flying cheeseburgers in outer space while their doctor works on them, and they might feel a little different. \nThat night-and-day difference in how kids respond to the pricks and prodding of their doctors is the reason for Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford's groundbreaking use of virtual reality technology . As one of the first hospitals in the country to implement distraction-based VR therapy in every patient unit, Packard Children's lets kids participate in fun and relaxing immersive experiences that can significantly reduce their anxiety \u2014 and even their pain . \nExperts have already found virtual reality has a major impact on kids' stress levels. \"VR is often so unfamiliar that it is instantly engaging and incredibly distracting,\" Veronica Tuss, a child life specialist with the hospital's Child Life and Creative Arts Department, told Stanford Medicine News Center . \"If I'm preparing a child for their very first IV, and they share with me that they don't want to see what's happening procedurally, I know I need a distraction that is visually engaging. With VR, an often-intimidating setting suddenly becomes this really cool thing or place that they get to explore. It can minimize the experience of getting the IV to the point that we may actually turn a negative experience into a positive one.\" \nThis isn't the first time Packard Children's has introduced innovative methods to ease patients' worries. In 2015, Sam Rodriguez, M.D., and Thomas Caruso, M.D., the co-founders of Packard Children's Childhood Anxiety Reduction through Innovation and Technology (CHARIOT) program, which is leading the VR rollout, introduced the Bedside Entertainment and Relaxation Theater (BERT). The system projects videos on a large screen attached to patients' gurneys so they can watch movies and music videos all the way to the operating room. Pretty cool stuff. \nAnd in early 2017, CHARIOT launched an interactive video game called Sevo the Dragon , which projects on the BERT screen and gamifies the administration of anesthesia, so the tiniest patients have something fun to do while breathing medicine through a mask. \nCaruso and Rodriguez are currently collaborating with Silicon Valley-based software engineers to create original VR content that's specifically tailored to pediatric patients. Spaceburgers , the duo's first game, was developed in collaboration with Juno VR , and it allows the kids to listen to relaxing music as they fly through outer space and zap objects. \nResearchers are now investigating how much of an impact VR actually has on pain and anxiety levels during certain procedures, and so far, the results are promising . Kids who are engaged with VR tend to be more cooperative, less fearful and experience less pain during procedures like blood draws. \nVR distraction therapy is being used for kids at Packard Children's as young as age 6 in specific areas like the emergency department, but the tool will be rolled out to all of the hospital's acute care floor units and Stanford Children's Health's ambulatory surgery clinics by the end of 2017, and it will even make a debut in the labor and delivery unit. \n\"Children shouldn't grow up being afraid to go to the doctor to have a shot, but certain experiences can cause phobias that last into adulthood. Needle phobia is a common example of that, and it's the primary reason adults avoid important immunizations like flu shots,\" Caruso told Stanford Medicine News Center. \"Now, when patients get a shot while they are wearing VR goggles, they are reporting only limited levels of pain, if any.\" Now That's Cool The earliest known fictional reference to what we now refer to as virtual reality can be found in a sci-fi story by Stanley G.

What will you do? \nOver 81,000 players in the medieval fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game ( MMORPG ) \"ArcheAge\" were faced with that question as they explored the fictional world of Erenor. \nWell, sort of. In a recent study , \"I Would Not Plant Apple Trees if the World Will Be Wiped...,\"\"ArcheAge\" players were placed in an end-times scenario to test their behavior when an apocalyptic event looms. \nThe researchers analyzed 270 million player behavior records during a closed beta test (CBT) of \"ArcheAge,\" a \"sandbox-style\" game that allows players to roam the world and choose their own path. At the end of the CBT, all characters, data and virtual property are deleted and the outcome of the players' behaviors loses its meaning. In other words, the virtual world was ending, and the players were aware of it. How would they behave during end times, when there is no penalty for harmful deeds? \nAs MMORPGs are approximations of the real world, the researchers aimed to use the beta test to understand people's actions in an actual apocalypse. To study the complex dynamics of the virtual world, the researchers classified 75 different in-game actions into 11 categories, including combat, raid, item production, housing and \"interaction doodads, when players interact with various worldly objects, e.g., harvesting a tree for wood.\" They collected the records of these actions during the 11-week gaming period as anonymized data, not linked to any real-world identities. \nThe authors found that as the apocalypse neared, more players abandoned their quests and stopped advancing their characters, quitting their efforts at leveling up and gaining abilities.

Bilgin S. Sasmaz/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images \nWhen Arthur Conan Doyle created the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes in 1887, he had no idea he was also creating the first modern-day superfans. His readers adored Holmes and quickly became obsessed with him \u2014 so obsessed that when Conan Doyle tired of the character and killed him off in 1893, they were incensed. A whopping 20,000 of them cancelled subscriptions to the magazine where the stories had appeared. Some wore black armbands in the streets while others organized letter-writing campaigns to bring Holmes back. A decade later, Conan Doyle relented with the publication of \"The Return of Sherlock Holmes.\" \nAnd that was just the first incarnation of Sherlock Holmes superfandom. In 1934, after Conan Doyle had stopped writing Holmes for good, a journalist named Christopher Morley started a club in New York called the Baker Street Irregulars where people could get together to talk about the fictional detective. The club also created rituals that continue to be de rigueur for devoted fans of all genres: fan fiction, conventions, even cosplay, in the form of wearing deerstalker hats. The club is still going strong. \nToday, superfans are everywhere. They cheer for, and fawn over, sports teams, boy bands, celebrities, TV shows, and comic books, among other things. It may seem silly to go nuts over pandas or Spider-Man. But there are good reasons why humans tend to do this. Will Pearson and Mangesh (Mango) Hattikudur tackle this intriguing topic in an episode of the podcast Part-Time Genius titled \"What's it take to be a Superfan?\" \nWill and Mango say most people are casual fans, not superfans. What's the difference? A casual fan of \"Game of Thrones\" might spend seven hours binge watching a season of the TV show. A superfan might spend an additional 20 hours listening to podcasts that dissect each episode of the show. \nWhat makes some people so obsessed? First, self-presentation, says Will. For instance, wearing certain clothes at Dragon Con , painting your face on game day, or consuming certain media. These conscious choices send a message about the kind of people we are or want to be. But is the signal mainly for ourselves or for the people around us? A study by psychotherapist Teresa Stern concluded that a community of fans provides a comfortable space for people to come to grips with their identities without being judged. This can also help them to build self esteem. \n\"We all want that sense of belonging,\" says Mango, \"and fandom just seems like one way of doing that.\" Missouri Tigers fans cheer during the first half of a college football game against the Auburn Tigers, Sept. 23, 2017, at Memorial Stadium in Columbia, Missouri. Scott Kane/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images \nOne study reported in the Atlantic crunched numbers on baseball attendance. It found that the most winning teams had the most fickle fan bases. In a way, that makes sense \u2014 if tickets will still be sold regardless of whether a team loses, the motivation to win could diminish. Does that mean, then, that these fans of losing teams get the short end of the stick? No, say the podcast hosts, they're still getting community and identity. \"Win or lose, the existence of the relationship props you up. A sports team and its fan base are an anchor point in an inconstant universe, fulfilling a need for belonging that some researchers argue is as fundamental a motivator as hunger,\" says Will. \nTo find out more, including the stuff Will and Mango themselves geek out about, listen to \"What's it take to be a Superfan?\" NOW THAT'S Wild The U.S. sports team with the most rabid fan base is the NFL's Green Bay Packers .

Audi \nAs some automotive safety experts have long suspected, recent studies show that the more technology we have in our cars, the worse we drive . And that includes cars' infotainment systems and active safety systems . \nThe American Automobile Association (AAA) sponsored a study that confirms how distracted drivers get. The study was conducted by researchers from the University of Utah and released in early October 2017. It rated 30 different vehicles' infotainment systems on their potential to distract drivers . The study found that navigation systems were the most demanding distractions, and tuning the radio and programming navigation took drivers eyes off the road longer than calling/dialing or texting. But overall, all infotainment tasks \u2014 calling or dialing, texting, tuning the radio or programming navigation \u2014 were \"associated with higher levels of cognitive demand.\" \nThe AAA research supports the findings of a University of Michigan study released this summer. This study, sponsored by an automaker, was designed to find out how drivers were using the automaker's blind spot warning system. Overwhelmingly, the researchers found, people driving cars with blind spot detection systems tended to change lanes without ever checking for traffic on their own. These two studies identify two main problems and hint at a third: Using some safety technology distracts drivers more. Drivers use safety systems as a primary source of input rather than as a backup. Automakers are racing to develop these types of technology, and some are less cautious than others. \nCombined, these factors add up to a lot more drivers paying a lot less attention to the road. \n\"The new technologies are sort of a double-edged sword,\" Bill Van Tassell, manager of driver training programs at AAA, explains. \"If they work properly and drivers use them properly, there is a net safety benefit. If it doesn't work properly, or the driver changes his or her behavior, there will be a net loss of safety.\" \nNewly released data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows traffic deaths have increased from 2015 to 2016 \u2014 by 2.6 percent per 100 million miles driven. But those deaths weren't due to distracted driving. Fatalities caused by distracted driving are actually decreased by more than 2 percent. \nEven though distracted driving fatalities are down, the rise in drivers not paying attention on the road is still a problem. Right now, many drivers have access to some type of autonomous driving technology , usually marketed as active safety systems, including: Blind spot monitoring Self-park or park assistance Dynamic cruise control, which automatically follows the car in front at a safe distance, slowing down and speeding up as necessary Lane keep assist, which senses when a car drifts out of its lane and helps the driver get back on track Forward collision warning with emergency braking, which senses when a car gets too close to the car in front of it and automatically applies the brakes Systems that scan for obstacles such as pedestrians, large animals, and cyclists, often combined with automatic emergency braking \nIt's easy to imagine that the more of these systems are found in any given car, the less that a car's driver will believe it is necessary to pay close attention to the road. Here's where the line gets blurred: Active safety systems are supposed to be a backup to a driver's skills, to step in if the driver should make an error. Yet autonomous and self-driving car technology implies, by its very name, that the driver won't really have to do anything behind the wheel. \nAnother issue is that most of these systems are still relatively new and have only recently begun to show up on affordable, mainstream cars. That means a lot of consumers don't know how to use them yet. Further complicating matters is that there is no consistency (enforced or voluntary) among the auto manufacturers, so these systems can operate very differently between different brands and models. \nEventually, a true self-driving car will use all of these systems and more, networked together to ensure the car never comes too close to neighboring traffic or other obstacles; however, drivers are still supposed to remain in control of the car. Since many drivers already show too much confidence in active safety systems, some safety experts worry that it will be hard to convince people to pay attention to the road in an even more autonomous vehicle . \nSome experts suggest that standardizing safety technology terminology will help consumers understand what they're buying and how it really works, but Van Tassell thinks drivers should focus on what they already have. \n\"You should know what your vehicle's systems [will do] and what they won't do,\" he says. \"You're the one taking the vehicle on the road, so you need to be the one who steps up and initiates that.\" \nWhile the ultimate responsibility lies with the driver, he says that auto manufacturers should also be proactive. \"Manufacturers need to create good information and training for customers, and their dealer networks who actually interact with the buyers need to make a good faith effort to get that information across,\" Van Tassel says. \nAs for the original question of whether our driving skills are deteriorating, Van Tassell is a bit more optimistic. He points out that drivers now need to learn how to use 20 or more new kinds of technology, so in a sense, our skill sets are expanding. \n\"I'm not sure there is actually a national erosion of driving skills,\" he says. \"In fact, we've seen a resurgence in training drivers safely in the last few years, so in effect, drivers need to know more now than they did a few years ago.\" \nIn the future, traditional driving skills may no longer be necessary, but fully autonomous cars are still a long way off. For the time being, drivers should be ever more vigilant, and ensure they're using self-driving technology as intended. Now That's Scary Tesla has probably gotten the most attention for its self-driving technology dubbed \"Autopilot\" and its well-documented public failures. The difference between Tesla and other automakers is that Tesla was essentially beta-testing its Autopilot technology on its customers, putting others on the road at risk. The saga of Model S Autopilot crashes is best seen as a cautionary tale for drivers who are all too eager to let their cars take over.

Kiger POSTED Oct 11, 2017 Activists have brought suit in federal court, aiming to grant the Colorado River the same legal rights as a person. David McNew/Getty Images \nA federal lawsuit filed in September against the state of Colorado seeks to have the Colorado River ecosystem recognized as \"possessing rights similar to a 'person,'\" including \"certain rights to exist, flourish, regenerate and naturally evolve.\" \nThe litigation, filed by Denver attorney Jason Flores-Williams , actually names the river ecosystem as the plaintiff in the suit. Environmental groups Deep Green Resistance (DGR) and the Southwest Coalition and several individual activists also are participating as the role of \"next friends\" acting on behalf of the river to bring the lawsuit. DGR activist Will Falk explained in a San Diego Free Press article that the lawsuit is an effort to counter a system that \"currently defines nature as property.\" \nFlores-Williams has significant experience representing homeless people in class-action litigation against the city of Denver and city officials. He says that that previous work inspired the river lawsuit. \"The only thing more homeless than homeless people is nature,\" he says. The Colorado River pictured five miles from its source in the Rocky Mountains. raclro/Getty Images \nFlores-Williams says that after researching legal efforts to protect the environment, he came to the conclusion that even those \"heroic\" lawsuits hadn't prevented environmental conditions from worsening. One reason, he says, is that \"many environmental cases are dismissed for a lack of standing, because you can't show what somebody, or a corporation or a state, is doing is of immediate harm to a human being.\" \n\"It's a real problem, a procedural defect,\" says Flores-Williams. \nIf the river lawsuit is successful, Flores-Williams says that it would enable groups to act on behalf of the river, and make their case by showing that a defendant is damaging the waterway, without the need to prove that humans are being hurt. \nThe idea of nature having legal rights isn't a new idea. Back in 1972, Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, in his dissenting opinion in the case of Sierra Club v. Morton, argued that environmental issues might be put in better focus if lawsuits could be filed \"in the name of the inanimate object about to be despoiled, defaced, or invaded by roads and bulldozers, and where injury is the subject of public outrage. Contemporary public concern for protecting nature's ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation.\" \nDouglas cited legal scholar Christopher D. Stone, whose book \"Should Trees Have Standing?\" made the case that natural objects could have legal rights, which would be exercised with the assistance of appointed guardians. \nSince then, an international movement has sprouted to confer legal rights on nature, and recently, several countries have afforded such status to rivers. In March 2017, for example, after long negotiations with indigenous people, the New Zealand Parliament passed legislation that declared the Whangagui (Te Awa Tupua) River to be \"a legal person\" with all of the rights, powers, duties and liabilities that any other New Zealand resident might have. \nShortly after the New Zealand decision, a court in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand ruled that the Ganges River and its main tributary, the Yamuna River, also deserved the same legal status as human beings. \nEven so, the Colorado River lawsuit may face a difficult legal road. Reed Benson, chairman of the environmental law program at the University of New Mexico, told the New York Times that he considered it \"a long shot in more ways than one.\" \nBut Flores-Williams doesn't seem deterred by the challenge, or by worries that some might take a dim view of a river being granted rights similar to those of a human being, or of a corporation . \n\"I wish people would get hung up on the idea that our environment is being diminished,\" he says. \"The river should have a right to exist.\" Additionally, he says, \"anyone knows that if the Colorado River is extinguished, it would cause an injury to us all.\" \nThe office of Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper declined to comment on the suit itself, but, via email, spokesperson Jacque Montgomery defended the state's efforts to protect the river. \n\"Colorado and countless partners have long understood the significance of the Colorado River system and the need to balance our needs for water with conservation and enhancement of the river ecosystem,\" she wrote. \"This extends from efforts to protect \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and improve habitat for \u00e2\u0080\u0094 endangered fish in the river over the course of decades to the recent development of Colorado's Water Plan. That plan's very essence is about working together to ensure sufficient water supplies for agriculture, cities, recreation and the environment as our state continues to grow. The Colorado River, and its protection, has been a fundamental focus of Colorado as a state, but also of local governments and water utilities who themselves depend upon the river's health and function as necessary for their own success.\" \nFlores-Williams says that activists in other states have expressed interest in filing similar suits. Now That's Interesting The Constitution of Ecuador contains an entire chapter laying out the legal rights of nature, including \"the right to integral respect for its existence\" and \"the right to be restored.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "patrick j. kiger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "william o. douglas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "will falk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john hickenlooper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher d. stone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flores-williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason flores-williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacque montgomery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david mcnew/getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reed benson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "san diego free press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southwest coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of new mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dgr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sierra club", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rocky mountains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecuador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uttarakhand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ganges river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "awa tupua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yamuna river", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T17:33:13.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "33c5ffefb87f6664494c624cacaf57ad42cc94f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoVIvuwAucPT6nvXj5WkYV9aW1LTS5g6MXAKx4YNz6BTWFG8eYR5ZNljh75Gqs5nrsfMlyB08G6y3eznrPJe2Pb3xBCcWVlFRA-", "site_full": "shows.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "The Mixed Bag of Mixed Reality", "title_full": "The Mixed Bag of Mixed Reality", "published": "2017-10-11T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/TechStuff-mixedbagvr-copy.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5, "comments": 0, "shares": 5}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "33c5ffefb87f6664494c624cacaf57ad42cc94f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoVIvuwAucPT6nvXj5WkYV9aW1LTS5g6MXAKx4YNz6BTWFG8eYR5ZNljh75Gqs5nrsfMlyB08G6y3eznrPJe2Pb3xBCcWVlFRA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-11T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Mixed Bag of Mixed Reality", "text": "The Mixed Bag of Mixed Reality POSTED Oct 11, 2017 + Subscribe TechStuff VR kukhmar/getty images \nWhat exactly is mixed reality?

WF Sihardian/EyeEm/Getty Images \nA new study published in the Journal of Applied Volcanology has finally arrived to tell us just how likely we are to die by volcano, and if we indeed met that grisly fate, how it might most likely go down. \nMore than 800 million people worldwide live within the footprint of an active volcano \u2014 that is to say, 10 percent of the world's population lives within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of certain death . OK, so, it's actually not certain. Potential death . Living near an active volcano is something of a hazard. According to the study, around 278,000 people have died since the year 1500 as a result of volcanic activity, which averages about 540 people a year for the past 517 years. A memorial to those who died in the May 18, 1980 Mount St. Helens volcanic eruption was placed on the 20th anniversary. Dan Callister/Online USA/Getty Images \nThe research team from the University of Bristol's School of Earth Sciences updated, corrected, and added new data to previously existing volcanic fatality databases, including information about how far people were from the active volcano when they died. As it happens, there are a few different mechanisms by which a volcano might kill you \u2014 the researchers refer to these as \"hazards\" \u2014 and some can happen when the volcano is active, and others even when it's quiet. \nThese hazards can range from being in the footprint of a volcanic eruption, as most fatalities happen within 3 miles (5 kilometers) of the volcano, to falling victim to volcanic gasses escaping from the ground, to succumbing to volcano-caused lahars , tsunami and tephra up to 9 miles (15 kilometers) or more from the volcano itself. (For the curious, those are volcanic mudflows, massive sea waves and material ejected into the atmosphere, respectively.) \nMost fatalities occurred in residential communities within 6 miles (10 kilometers) of a volcano, but people have been killed by volcanoes from as far away as 105 miles (170 kilometers). For those close to the blast, it's mostly pyroclastic density currents \u2014 avalanches of molten rock, ash and deadly gases \u2014 that kills them. Those who don't live in the area right around the volcano also lose their lives, but less commonly. While the majority of deaths in the past centuries comprised nearby residents, volcanoes have killed 561 tourists, 108 miners, 67 scientists, 57 emergency responders and 30 members of the media. \n\"The identification of these groups of victims is key for improving safety and reducing deaths and injuries in these groups, said lead author and volcanologist Sarah Brown of the University of Bristol's School of Earth Sciences , in a press release . \n\"While volcanologists and emergency response personnel might have valid reasons for their approach into hazardous zones, the benefits and risks must be carefully weighed,\" she said. \"The media and tourists should observe exclusion zones and follow direction from the authorities and volcano observatories. Tourist fatalities could be reduced with appropriate access restrictions, warnings and education.\" \nScientists have identified 1,508 active volcanoes around the world. So, whether you live near one or you don't \u2014 or your plan to cook S'mores over a lava flow takes an unexpected turn \u2014 the point is, be careful in volcano country!

Noel Hendrickson/Getty Images \nThe year after North Carolina working mom Spencer (she asked that her full name not be used) had her first child, she says she could hardly leave the house. \"After she was born, I didn't have a pedicure for a year because there was no going anywhere,\" she says. Her husband, who she says is a devoted father, just didn't really know what he was doing when his daughter was born, and that left her with the majority of the baby duties. \nAnd apparently situations like Spencer's are not uncommon. A first-of-its-kind study released Oct. 9, 2017, from The Ohio State University and published online for the journal Sex Roles concluded that women pull most of the weight when it comes to caring for newborns and tending to housework , especially on non-workdays. \n\"I probably did 98 percent of the work when our first child was born,\" Spencer says. \"Part of that was because [her husband] traveled, but even when he was here, I could only get him to change diapers. He wasn't the one getting up with her.\" \nThat inequality in child care and household duties, the small study found, was par for the course for the 52 couples who participated. The couples completed time diaries for workdays and non-workdays during the women's third trimesters through three months after the babies were born. No other study has had couples provide such detailed information about what they were doing on the same day at the same time. The research found that when the babies were around 3 months old, dads were more likely to spend their days off work relaxing 46 percent of the time while moms did housework and took care of the babies. \nBut on days when men took charge of child care and housework, women spent just 16 percent of their time relaxing. The women were instead most often working around the house or helping out with the child. In fact, the moms in the study spent half as much time \u2014 46 to 49 minutes \u2014 relaxing than their husbands, who spent about 101 minutes of downtime. \n\"It's frustrating. Household tasks and child care are still not being shared equally, even among couples who we expected would have more egalitarian views of how to share parenting duties,\" Claire Kamp Dush, lead author of the study and associate professor of human sciences at The Ohio State University, says in a statement . \nNorth Carolina mom Spencer agrees and says her husband had no choice but to step up when their second child was born last year. \"I still put [our daughter] Briant down to sleep, so he has to take care of the baby,\" she says. \"A lot of the things he didn't do with Briant, he has had to do with the baby. When I was still nursing, he had to take her to parties, and he's had to change more diapers, too. Some of it is a comfort level thing, but some of it is necessity.\" \nNot all of the findings were bad for dads, though. The times the men in the study fell short during the nonworking days, they made up during the workdays. \n\"On workdays, parents are more evenly splitting housework and child care. It's very much 'all hands on deck' but when there is more time available on the weekend and parents are not so pressed to get everything done, then we see the emergence of gendered patterns and inequality where women do a lot more housework and child care while he leisures,\" study author Jill Yavorsky,assistant professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, says in a statement . \nDush says couples like those in the study, which consisted of mostly highly educated, white, dual-earner couples from the Columbus, Ohio area having their first child, are the ones she anticipated would share housework and child care equally. \n\"I was expecting to see a lot more minutes where the couple was doing some kind of housework or child care together,\" she says. \"I suspect the situation may be even less equitable for women who don't have all the advantages of the couples in our sample.\" \nSpencer says she and her husband do share responsibilities during the workweek but they're still not quite 50/50. \"This has been a four-year conversation,\" she says. \"The first thing moms think about is the kids and what always needs to get done. I think the man just thinks the mom will take care of it.\" Now That's Interesting According to a 2015 Pew Research study , dads spend about seven hours a week on child care. But that's triple the time they spent in 1965. And the nine hours a week they said they spend on household chores? That's also increased \u2014 it was just four hours in 1965.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T02:30:51.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ecf1ef3fd253499a09d09fb92deeddc6b443bfb0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Q6TznVkCfdT_9s0z_b4IDM3MzZtScO2R2YQHnwQnoob0YD4rQkmDDULCZ_UXCdPetLlKvHsCLwCpOnhkBKXd9bniyHUE3aH1WgC.tfe1KDlNFwJu4JlRlRFKefagtEDiA-", "site_full": "animals.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW?type%5b%5d=article&type%5b%5d=list&type%5b%5b=quiz", "site_categories": ["pets"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "People Sleep More Soundly With Their Dogs in the Bedroom ...

Robert Daly/Getty Images \nMany people see dogs as legit members of the family, so it's no surprise that dog and owner often wind up snoozing side by side. But are these pet parents sacrificing their own sleep quality ? Researchers at the Mayo Clinic's Arizona campus recently sought to uncover the truth, with some surprising results. \nTheir small study fitted 40 participants and their pups (older than 6 months of age) with sleep trackers, which they wore for seven nights. The data revealed that sleeping with animals in the bedroom actually helped participants achieve better quality sleep. \n\"Most people assume having pets in the bedroom is a disruption,\" says Lois Krahn, M.D., a co-author of the study and a sleep medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic, in a press statement . \"We found that many people actually find comfort and a sense of security from sleeping with their pets.\" \nHowever, those participants who cuddled right up to a pup didn't sleep as well as those whose dogs were in their own beds. But the difference was not great. The sleep efficiency (the time spent in bed versus the time spent sleeping) for people with a dog in the bedroom was 83 percent. When the dog was in the bed, it was a tad above 80 percent. Eighty percent is considered the cut-off point for acceptable sleep efficiency. \nSleep expert and clinical psychologist Dr. Michael J. Breus is not surprised by the findings. \"For years, I have been saying that it is OK to sleep with animals in your bed. It is a very comforting feeling; they are members of your family.\" \nBreus has two small dogs, as well as a cat. \"Our animals usually sleep on top of our bed,\" he says. He recommends a 25-pound (11-kilogram) cut-off for pet bedmates. \"Once you go much over that, there is a space issue, a movement issue, and in some cases a snoring issue [with] bulldogs and 'mushy faced' animals,\" he says. He also suggests that they remain on top of the covers, rather than snuggling under. And, \"Consider getting an accurate sleep tracker ... and monitor if your pet is disruptive or helpful to your sleep.\" Now That's Cool Dogs, especially large breeds, get a lot more shut-eye than humans do. In fact, they average between 12 and 14 hours per 24-hour cycle, especially older pooches and young pups.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T02:31:24.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "369eab57cdd5d580b240cd0d4e0452a0f73984dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3KiTuFgTWY4yb_au9btwFIBqmNzzgUjn4Th31ssDHM62aFxBa0sOgk4d6bqezB5DavWyK6UanCABvsFwuOP71WI7E3SDBXomgGKm_tre7GrJD._mMQg_y0F", "site_full": "entertainment.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW?type%5b%5d=article&type%5b%5d=list&type%5b%5b=quiz", "site_categories": ["media", "television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "Cirque du Soleil: Masters of Performance and \u2026 Water Filtration?", "title_full": "Cirque du Soleil: Masters of Performance and \u2026 Water Filtration?", "published": "2017-10-13T00:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/Cirque-luzia-performer.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 110, "comments": 0, "shares": 110}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "369eab57cdd5d580b240cd0d4e0452a0f73984dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3KiTuFgTWY4yb_au9btwFIBqmNzzgUjn4Th31ssDHM62aFxBa0sOgk4d6bqezB5DavWyK6UanCABvsFwuOP71WI7E3SDBXomgGKm_tre7GrJD._mMQg_y0F", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Robert Lamb", "published": "2017-10-13T00:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cirque du Soleil: Masters of Performance and \u2026 Water Filtration?", "text": "Cirque du Soleil: Masters of Performance and \u2026 Water Filtration? by Robert Lamb POSTED Oct 12, 2017 A performer in Cirque du Soleil's \"Luzia\" show dazzles the audience despite being fully drenched.

Behind the scenes, the technical aspects of this effect are equally impressive. \n\"Every time we create a production, we strive to come-up with performances and stage pictures that will surprise our audience and evoke their emotions,\" says Cirque publicist Francis Jalbert. \"'Luzia' is a complex show as we incorporated technology we had never worked with before. Playing with water onstage under the Big Top brought us to find ways to recycle the water, heat it, clean it and pump it all the way at the top of the tent for the acts involving rain.\" \nAnd \"Luzia\" uses a lot of water \u2014 1,585 gallons (6,000 liters) for a single performance, in fact. And since the show recycles the water for all of a given city's shows, they have to run it all through a filtration and disinfection system. After all, an aerial strap performance is death-defying enough without the risk of cholera. The backstage team stores the water at a constant 82 degrees F (28 degrees C) before pumping it up to a rotating array of 174 spray nozzles 56 feet (17 meters) above the stage. \n\"We also had to figure out how to dry the stage quickly for acts requiring a dry surface,\" says Jalbert, \"and find out how to protect microphones and other technical equipment from getting wet. That's why the creation process of a show at Cirque du Soleil lasts over two years; we constantly come up with new technologies and learn how to master them as we go to bring the vision of the creators to life.\" \nBut the technology is only one aspect of the show. The human performers in \"Luzia\" also had to adjust to this new performance element. Which tricks could be performed wet? How might they avoid the risk of slippery acrobatic props and water-heavy garments? \nThe Cirque team dreamed up several creative solutions. For instance, they constructed a special \"wet\" trapeze out of sailing rope and a wooden bar for improved grip. The human-centered \" Cyr wheel \" used in the show is covered with a bike tire, because otherwise it would prove impossible to manipulate on a wet surface. A performer deftly handles the modified Cyr wheel without her hands and feet slipping. Cirque du Soleil \nWas all of this technical effort worth it? According to Jalbert, the answer is in the audience reaction. \n\"You can see the amazement on their faces as they first see the rain and feel the coolness of the water in the air. There is a particular moment where shapes and designs appear in the rain; it's literally raining images of animals and plants. The audience reacts loudly as they've never seen something like this before and are moved by the combination of this simple moment with our powerful musical score.\" \n\" Luzia \" is currently at Atlanta's Atlantic Station through November 2017, followed by runs in Los Angeles and Costa Mesa, California. Now That's Cool Cirque du Soleil first traveled to the U.S. in 1987. That show was called \"We Reinvent the Circus.\" In the 30 years since, it's safe to say that Cirque has indeed done some reinventing of the Big Top.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T02:31:33.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6f82f328b0129ad167c0d2cea79636d08b7efe72", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoVIvuwAucPT6nvXj5WkYV9aW1LTS5g6MXAKx4YNz6BTeGMc7eJOzJfXr4hXXwRxXOMDM1t1XoOFw--", "site_full": "shows.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "Equifax", "title_full": "Equifax", "published": "2017-10-13T00:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/tsd-equifax.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6f82f328b0129ad167c0d2cea79636d08b7efe72", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoVIvuwAucPT6nvXj5WkYV9aW1LTS5g6MXAKx4YNz6BTeGMc7eJOzJfXr4hXXwRxXOMDM1t1XoOFw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T00:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Equifax", "text": "+ Subscribe Equifax headquarters in Atlanta, GA.

General Mills \nWho among us hasn't dumped an entire box of cereal just to get the prize inside? Well, consider this: It might take just seconds to empty the box to get to that toy, but it can take up to 18 months to get it there. \nThat's according to Mike Siemienas, a spokesman for General Mills, who says his company considers all kinds of variables before deciding what prizes make it into their cereals, including the toy category in general, play trends and influences from kids. \nAfter all, it's all about the kids. They've been clamoring for the those prizes and games since 1909 when Kellogg's became the first company to begin using \"premiums\" in its cereal products. General Mills followed in the 1930s , and has tempted the tiniest of diners with the best of American pop culture treats, including Lone Ranger comic books, Green Hornet rings, Hello Kitty stickers, and of course, \"Star Wars\" goodies. The most nostalgic cereal toys are now collectibles. \nToys became such a significant part of marketing cereal that General Mills had its own toy division from 1965 through the mid-'80s, acquiring Rainbow Crafts (the company that made Play-Doh), Kenner and Parker Brothers to create it. Aside from producing toys for its cereals, General Mills toy division produced some of the most memorable toys of that time, including Betty Crocker Easy-Bake Ovens, the Spirograph, Nerf balls, and action figures for the popular '70s TV series \"Six-Million Dollar Man\" and \"Bionic Woman.\" \nPerhaps the company's most successful collaboration is its partnership with the \"Star Wars\" franchise. In 1977, the year the eponymous first film in the series (now known more elaborately as \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\") debuted in theaters, General Mills and its toy division, Kenner, jumped at the chance several companies turned down: a licensing opportunity with the film . The gamble paid off. \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\" was a huge success. A year later, General Mills (via Kenner) created the 12 original \" Star Wars \" action figures and a plastic Millennium Falcon spaceship, and its Cheerios, Trix, Cocoa Puffs and Lucky Charms cereals had \"Star Wars\" movie posters, stick-on toys, cards, hang gliders and kites inside for fans. General Mills offered several cereal prizes from 2015's 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'. General Mills \nThrough the years, not only have toys changed to reflect what's in the box office, the toys have also changed with children's expectations. Now, there's a \"greater interest in the collectability of an in-box premium,\" Siemienas says via email, and the quality of the play experience matters, too. Parents, and by proxy, their children, affect what toys become box premiums through studies where parents share what their children like and don't like. \n\"Our goal is to team up with the best partners that are relevant to current cultural trends and give-away items that the whole family may enjoy,\" Siemienas says. \"Some items are for short-term fun and others are collectibles that people keep for years.\" But, he says, other things impact the toys they choose, too, including their collectability, size, safety standards and the fun they bring to consumers. \nGeneral Mills no longer has a toy division (General Mills spun off Kenner Parker Toys in 1985) but its licensing partnership with \"Star Wars\" is solid . After 40 years, the company is now including \"Star Wars\" toys and premiums designed to appeal not only to children, but to the first generation of \"Star Wars\" fans \u2014 the parents who are now sharing their favorite film franchise with their children. \"This behavior is most prevalent when the adult and child have a shared interest in an established versus new property,\" Siemienas says. \nAs for what you can expect in or on cereal boxes in the future, General Mills doesn't like to spoil the surprise. Though it's safe to assume that \"Star Wars\" will appear on the cereal aisle again soon, with \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" coming to theaters in December. But, as Siemienas told us, \"If we weren't excited about a premium item, we would not put it in a box.\" Now That's Interesting The very first cereal box prize was a book \u2014 \"The Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Book\" \u2014 offered by Kellogg's in 1909 . By 1912, Kellogg's had distributed 2.5 million copies and kept the book in production for 28 years.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shaun chavis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "betty crocker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kellogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike siemienas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siemienas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kellogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenner parker toys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainbow crafts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parker brothers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general mills", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kenner", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T22:21:58.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "430d6f4ddeee42e2a872bbf48f701cf7f9efe870", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoVIvuwAucPT6nvXj5WkYV9x3MpoBh61ZBPGYCYYQhQPoFmPUFYwLLKYJSIRy5WmC3.IwyaXZN_6Q--", "site_full": "shows.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "Cocktail Hour: The Whiskey Sour", "title_full": "Cocktail Hour: The Whiskey Sour", "published": "2017-10-13T17:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/whiskey-sour.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 31, "comments": 0, "shares": 31}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "430d6f4ddeee42e2a872bbf48f701cf7f9efe870", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoVIvuwAucPT6nvXj5WkYV9x3MpoBh61ZBPGYCYYQhQPoFmPUFYwLLKYJSIRy5WmC3.IwyaXZN_6Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T17:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cocktail Hour: The Whiskey Sour", "text": "a division of InfoSpace Holdings LLC Newsletter \nGet the best of HowStuffWorks by email.

Kiger POSTED Oct 13, 2017 Whether fully autonomous or merely just technologically advanced, the trucks of the future will still require some human oversight, industry experts say. Education Images/UIG/Getty Images \nIf you saw the recent X-Men movie \"Logan,\" you probably remember one startling scene that showed driverless robotic trucks hurtling down the highway in the year 2029. \nThat futuristic vision isn't here yet, and experts say there are significant technological and regulatory challenges that would have to be overcome before autonomous trucks dominate our highways. But already, truck manufacturers have been making significant strides toward automating much of the work human truck drivers currently perform \u2014 and those advances eventually may lead to future fleets of big rigs that transport their loads safely without a person behind the wheel. New Tech on the Road \nVehicle manufacturer Daimler tested an experimental big rig in Nevada in 2015, but the company isn't going to put such autonomous vehicles (AVs) into production any time soon. An automated, driverless \"super truck\" manufactured by Foton Motor Group is displayed at a vehicle expo in Shanghai, China, in 2016. (Xinhua/Chen Fei/Getty Images) \n\"An AV requires significant system redundancies in the event of a component failure, a significant increase in sensing to provide an accurate 360-degree view of the environment \u2014 particularly challenging with a trailer \u2014 and a significant increase in computational power and artificial intelligence,\" says Derek Rotz, director of advanced engineering for Daimler Trucks North America, via email. \"In short, we see significant development hurdles to be autonomous, which adds cost and complexity to the vehicle.\" \nIn a 2016 corporate blog post on the future of autonomous trucks, Scott Perry, chief technology and procurement officer for the commercial trucking giant Ryder, wrote that \"increased road safety regulations have played a large role in driving advancements in onboard vehicle technologies.\" \nIn an interview, he says that the industry already is outfitting human-driven trucks with technology such as adaptive cruise control , forward-looking radar, and collision-avoidance and lane-departure warning systems, in an effort to make trucks safer. Minding the Gap \nAnother promising automation advance that could help human truck drivers is platooning technology, which enables trucks to communicate with each other and follow one another at distances close enough to reduce air drag and boost fuel efficiency. \n\"Collapsing the following distance from 150 to 50 feet (46 meters to 15 meters) would improve the fuel economy of the lead vehicle by 4 percent, and the trailing vehicle by 10 percent,\" Perry says. If a car got between them, the trucks' platooning technology automatically would adapt and lengthen their following distance, he says. Past generations imagined a futuristic setting for the trucking industry, as in this 1943 illustration advertising axles for the Timken-Detroit Axle Company, but they often depicted human drivers. Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago /Getty Images \nDaimler recently began testing platooning on selected highways in Oregon and Nevada. The company's director of advanced engineering emphasizes that Daimler intends the technology to augment a human at the wheel, rather than replace him or her. \"Daimler Trucks North America believes the driver will remain indispensable to the vehicle, as their responsibilities go beyond steering, accelerating and braking,\" says Rotz. \"Therefore the platooning system is developed specifically with the driver in mind.\" \nBut without totally replacing drivers, automating many of their tasks could make their work easier, and help them to work longer and more safely. That could help the trucking industry cope with a growing shortage of drivers that's projected to reach 175,000 nationwide by 2024, according to trade publication Logistics Management, up from 2017's shortage of 48,000 drivers. \nThose technologies also could pave the way eventually for trucks that are fully autonomous . Besides easing driver shortages, autonomy also could help reduce highway congestion. Perry envisions driverless trucks that would communicate with each other and slow their speed in unison as they approached a major city, allowing traffic to continue to flow smoothly. Or the driverless fleets could travel late at night, he says, when there aren't as many commuters in cars on the road. Powered by Batteries \nBy making truck travel more efficient, autonomous technology might also extend the range of future generations of battery-powered electric trucks that would help reduce carbon emissions. \nIn Sweden, startup truck maker Einride has developed a prototype electric driverless big rig called the T-pod, a 23-foot-long (7-meters-long) rig that weighs in at 20 tons (18.1 metric tons) fully loaded, and is envisioned as a cleaner alternative to conventional diesel-burning big rigs. What's particularly attention-getting about the T-pod is that it not only lacks a steering wheel and pedals and a windshield, but doesn't even have a cabin for a human to ride in. \n\"The T-pod will be autonomous,\" says Einride chief executive Robert Falck, in an email, \"but will have a remote driver that is able to take over in certain situations where the system needs assistance \u2014 such as construction, getting on and off highways, or any other unpredictable situations. \nEinride is perfoming a pilot program for an unnamed customer in late 2017, and has set a goal of having a network for 200 T-pods up and running by 2020, Falck says.

ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images \nOn Oct. 12, 2017, the MGM Resorts International issued a statement disputing the Las Vegas police report that there was a six-minute delay between the time gunman Stephen Paddock shot security guard Jesus Campos at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and the time he opened fire from the 32nd floor into a crowd of concertgoers, killing 58 people and injuring more than 500. MGM, which owns Mandalay Bay, says the time delay was more like 40 seconds, according to new information it received. (Police confirmed there was no six-minute gap today.) \nThe hotel was responding to one of the unanswered questions and concerns that people have voiced about hotel security: Why was there a delay? How was the gunman able to make several trips back and forth to his hotel room to bring in 23 weapons without anyone noticing? And, why, if many of the moments of the shooter's preparations were captured on hotel surveillance camera , was nothing done? \nHotel security in the U.S. today seems to be where airport security was before 9/11. Will it change after the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history? And how should it? Metal Detectors in Hotels? \nMac Segal is head of hotel security consulting for the global security firm AS Solution. He says that metal detectors, luggage searches and armed guards are already standard at Western-style five-star hotels across Africa and the Middle East. That's because upscale hotels have proven to be attractive targets for terrorists. \n\"In the last three years, over 300 people have been killed or injured in terror-related attacks on hotels in Africa,\" says Segal, citing deadly incidents in Mali, Egypt, Burkina Faso and Libya. Malian troops take security measurements outside the Radisson Blu Hotel in Bamako, Mali, on Nov. 20, 2015. Gunmen took 170 hostages and at least 20 people, including 18 hostages and two attackers, were killed in the siege. Habibou Kouyate/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images \nBut in the United States, terror threats and active shooter situations hadn't even made it onto the radar for most hotels. Until now. \n\"In the U.S., hotel security has ended with petty theft, potential sexual harassment and drunk guys in the bar,\" says Segal. \nPerhaps one of the reasons that Stephen Paddock could carry so many weapons up to his luxury suite in the Mandalay Bay is that most hotel security in the U.S. is focused on protecting the guests, not profiling them as potential threats. \n\"In hotel security, they're looking at two things,\" says Bill Nesbitt, a security consultant and expert witness with Security Management Services International. \"They want to protect the guests against outside incursions. They also want to protect the guests against any dishonest employees.\" Would Tougher Security Measures Have Helped? \nWhen Paddock opened fire through two broken hotel windows at 20,000 concertgoers attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival, he became the first lone gunman in U.S. history to use a hotel as a staging ground for an attack. It's unclear at this point whether Mandalay Bay could have done anything to predict or prevent the shooting, given that Paddock's profile and behavior didn't follow the typical pattern for a mass shooter. \nAnother important fact, says Segal, is that the target of Paddock's attack wasn't the hotel. \n\"I don't think the conversation right now should just be about hotel security,\" Segal says. \"The Mandalay Bay was not attacked. The hotel was not attacked in any shape or form. No guest was injured or threatened. The only person injured [in the hotel] was that incredibly brave security officer.\" \nWhile the Las Vegas shooting should absolutely be a wake-up call for hotels, Segal says he thinks that bigger questions need to be asked about event security and particularly event evacuation plans. Hundreds of people were injured trying to flee the outdoor music festival, with some scrambling over barbed-wire fences and others trampled in a panicked rush for the exits. Segal believes that venues need to design exits and evacuation plans specifically for active shooter situations, not just fires. \nStill, says Nesbitt, hotels need to be on guard against copycats who are inspired by Paddock's rampage \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just as there have been many copycat killings after Columbine. More Effective Security Measures \nYet, Segal says that hotels can tighten security against future terrorist or lone gun attackers without turning hotel lobbies into military checkpoints. \n\"Increased security doesn't mean that we have to inconvenience the guests, make the guests feel intimidated, make the kids feel scared or make the hotel look like a prison,\" says Segal. \"On the contrary, you can do this in an intelligent, aesthetic manner that still allows for a positive guest experience and still keeps people safe.\" \nWhile some hotels may install more cameras and metal detectors, the best protection against future attacks, says Segal, is a well-trained hotel staff. Every hotel employee, from housekeeping to blackjack dealers, needs to be trained in how to recognize \"suspicious indicators\" of an imminent attack. \n\"You see nervousness, aggression, tunnel vision, repeated body movements, avoidance of eye contact,\" says Segal. \"Maybe the guy pays for the room in cash, doesn't want to give ID.\" \nAgain, whether that type of training would have prevented the gunman's attack is unclear, since all accounts describe Paddock as cool, calm and drawing no attention or suspicion before the attack. \nSteve Wynn, CEO of Wynn Resorts, told Fox News that his Las Vegas hotels implemented heightened security protocols in 2015 after identifying The Strip as a soft target for terrorists. Those protocols included a \"no gun\" policy for all guests and security training for all hotel staff members. In addition, all entrances and exits are monitored with cameras and hidden metal detectors to alert security personnel to suspicious individuals. \nWhile Wynn refused to say whether his hotels' security measures could have prevented an attack like Paddock's, he did point to the fact that Paddock had holed up in his room for 36 hours, which should have been a red flag. \n\"We also have rules about 'do not disturb,'\" Wynn told Fox News. \"If a room goes on 'do not disturb' for more than 12 hours, we investigate.\" Now That's Interesting College student Paige Gasper, who was injured in the Las Vegas music festival massacre, has filed a lawsuit against MGM Resorts and others for liability in this mass shooting.

LSG \nAntarctica is no place for a tomato. But starting in January 2018, researchers at the German Antarctic research station, Neumayer III, will begin growing not only tomatoes but also lettuces, herbs, peppers, cucumbers, swiss chard, radishes and even strawberries inside a climate-controlled shipping container. Although other indoor gardens have existed in Antarctica, the EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility will be the most advanced indoor farm on the continent \u2014 an experiment meant to push the limits of indoor agriculture, so that the technology can hold up for a long mission to Mars . \n\"Some of my colleagues like to say, 'It's no longer your grandmother's garden anymore,'\" says Matthew Bamsey, a research associate at DLR, also known as the German Aerospace Center, and a member of the EDEN ISS team, a multipartner project focused on developing plant cultivation technologies for future use in space. \nOut on the Ekstr\u00f6m Ice Shelf in the Atlantic sector, the greenhouse will stand against Antarctica's frigid temperatures, the long dark winter and extremely low humidity. From the outside it's a simple structure, just two 20-foot (6-meter) shipping containers placed end to end. But inside, it's a high-tech oasis capable of producing 661 pounds (300 kilograms) of produce annually. To give you an idea of how much that is, in 2013, the average U.S. person consumed 272 pounds (123 kilograms) of fruits and vegetables. \nFine-tuning the operation for space is one of the main goals of the project. \n\"We don't want an astronaut working 16 hours a day in the greenhouse,\" he says. \nThe experiment will allow them to figure out just how much time is needed to tend the garden. Over the next year, they'll get closer to that answer. \nThe indoor garden is based on a soil-free growing system called aeroponics. The system, first invented in the 1920s but advanced by NASA in the 1990s, is extremely water-efficient, using 98 percent less water than soil-based gardens. Plants grow in trays on racks, with their roots suspended within a protected chamber that prevents light from entering. At regular intervals, the hanging roots are spritzed with a fine water and nutrient-rich mist. Any water not taken in by the roots is captured and recirculated. The Future Exploration Greenhouse pictured here (not in Antarctica) is the area where the plants grow in the EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility. The greenhouse has 135 square feet (12.5 square meters) available for cultivation. Bruno Stubenrauch \nSensors monitor the nutrient levels and provide data to a computer that analyzes the mix and adjusts it according to the plants being grown and their stage of growth. Cameras monitor the plant's growth, while other sensors capture temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide levels, which are fed to a computer that keeps the ideal levels precisely tuned. Air filters keep the environment free of bacteria and fungus, while an ultraviolet light helps sterilize the air and kill any organism not caught in the filter. Because of the sterile environment, neither insecticides nor pesticides are required. \nThe plants grow beneath LED lights that illuminate the leaves in blue, red and white light, which when mixed together, bathe the room in pinkish-violet sci-fi glow, says Bamsey. The lights shine for 16 hours a day and then turn off for eight hours to simulate night. \nAs of this writing, the greenhouse, comprising two shipping containers, is making its way by ship to Cape Town, South Africa, where it will be transferred to another ship bound for Antarctica, and due to arrive on Dec. 24, 2017. Bamsey and several of his colleagues, including DLR scientist Paul Zabel, will be there to meet the shipment and oversee its transport by tracked vehicle approximately 12 miles (20 kilometers) across the ice shelf. Bamsey says the shipping containers will be placed end to end atop an 8.2-foot (2.5-meter) tall platform that will prevent the greenhouse from becoming buried in snow. One shipping container, named the Future Exploration Greenhouse, houses the plants and the other, the Service Section, contains the control systems that keep them alive. As this drawing shows, the greenhouse will be split into three separate sections: a cold porch/airlock, a service section and the actual greenhouse. LSG \nAll of the DLR scientists, including Bamsey, will return home after seven weeks, with the exception of Zabel, who will stay behind at Neumayer III, along with nine other researchers. There, Zabel will keep an eye on the greenhouse, which will sit about (1,312 feet) 400 meters away from the main station. Along with making sure all of the systems are running smoothly, he'll prune the plants, harvest them when they're ready and take samples that will be sent back to partner research labs. Having some interaction with the plants provides a psychological benefit, says Bamsey. And even though a fully autonomous system is possible, the engineers likely will not design one. Previous research has shown that for people stationed in remote areas like Antarctica, tending to plants, interacting with them and just observing them improves a person's state of mind. \nBamsey referred to a 2013 South Korean study , conducted after an indoor garden was installed at the King Sejong Station on Antarctica. It found that 83 percent of station crew members found the fresh produce to be \"very helpful\" or \"somewhat helpful\" to their mental health. \nThe psychological benefits of having greenery in Antarctica goes back to the 1902 Discovery Expedition of the continent, led by Robert Falcon Scott, where some of the crew members grew cress and mustard in the ship's ward under natural light, says Bamsey. In some of the crewmen's journal entries, they talk of the plants, the energy and time they took to care for them and the boost to morale they provided. \n\"Some of the crew members and explorers of that time talk about how this was the first green material they had eaten in two years,\" says Bamsey. \nThe greenhouse has funding until the end of 2018. Produce samples will be sent back to labs in Europe to test for their nutritional value and if all goes well, the researchers will be back again for another frigid growing season.

We've pulled out some of the stories that inspired us most this week, from virtual reality in hospitals to growing fresh veggies in Antarctica. So, keep reading (and listening) to find out how exhilarating your world can be. The Fantastic \nKids at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital in Palo Alto, California, are getting some reprieve from painful medical procedures, and it's coming from an unlikely source \u00e2\u0080\u0094 virtual reality technology . That's right. The hospital is one of the first in the U.S. to use what's called distraction-based VR therapy. In a nutshell, the kids get to put on a VR headset during different procedures and escape into another world of fun and immersive experiences that have been proven to reduce their anxiety \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and even their pain. The Freaky \nIn honor of Friday the 13th (and the next season of \"Stranger Things\" dropping just weeks away), Stuff To Blow Your Mind hosts Robert, Joe and Christian get real about the science behind the fictional show. In this episode of the podcast , they delve deep into the mysteries of actual government research and psychic phenomena, sensory deprivation tanks (not unlike the tanks Eleven is forced to float in), interdimensional travel and the real-life researcher behind the demented Dr. Brenner. Sit down and listen up. Just don't forget your Eggos. The Futuristic \nIf you think growing tomatoes in your home garden is tough, try growing them in Antarctica. That's what a group of scientists at the German Antarctic research station, Neumayer III, will do starting in January 2018. No ... they won't be growing them on the ice tundra. They'll be growing all types of veggies with the help of aeroponics and LED lighting inside a super high-tech shipping container. It's all part of research to determine if the same type of technology could one day be replicated on a mission to Mars.

Dorling Kindersley, Ruth Jenkinson/Getty Images \nYour pinky toe might seem like it serves no real function but to look cute. But if you've ever stubbed, fractured or otherwise injured it, you find out otherwise. You're probably surprised at how much an injured fifth toe affects your everyday life. \nThe pinky is part of a complex system within the foot. In fact, every standard foot is composed of 30 joints, 28 bones and more than 100 tendons and ligaments. All these parts can make any foot injury extra-unpleasant. \"Any pain in that area is definitely high since it is mostly muscle and blood, leading to more inflammation and aches when swollen,\" explains Dr. Aditi Gupta Jha, lead physician at the medical online consulting platform, JustDoc.com,\u200b in an email. \nYou can learn to live without this little piggy, but it's easier to have one, as it works in concert with the other toes and rest of the foot to get us where we need to go. \"The purpose of the pinky toe is to provide balance and propulsion,\" says podiatrist Dr. Bruce Pinker with Progressive Foot Care in Nanuet, New York. \"As one takes a step, the foot rolls from lateral to medial in normal foot biomechanics.\" This motion helps us \"push off\" to the next step. When the pinky is damaged in some way, the propulsion is limited, leading to an affected gait. Occasionally, side effects can be more severe. \"If [the fifth toe is] injured or has to be amputated, it can lead to falls from imbalance,\" Dr. Jha says. \nIn fact, our reliance on the foot's \"tripod\" of balance (the heel, pinky toe knuckle and big toe knuckle) is pretty critical. Loss of one of those elements can significantly inhibit a person's ability to skip, run or walk. The pinky also helps us to push off the side of a swimming pool when diving in, making it extra-important to the livelihoods of competitive swimmers, says podiatrist Dr. Mark Hinkes via email. \nThe type of shoes you wear can impact your little toe negatively. \"In fashion footwear, the pinky toe can rub against the inside of the shoe until a 'bursa,' which is a fluid-filled sac between the skin and bone, develops. This malady is known as bursitis and it really hurts,\" says Hinkes, noting that narrow-toed shoes are pinky killers. Pointy-toe shoes can also cause hammertoe to develop, which is when the toe abnormally bends in the middle. It's more common in the second, third and fourth toes at the middle joint, but can also occur in pinkies. Wearing high heels and pointy-toe shoes can be bad for your pinkies. Peter Dazeley/Getty Images \nThe pain potential doesn't end there, however. \"Pinky toes are famous for developing soft tissue lesions on the top, tip, or in-between the toes. These lesions are called corns,\" Hinkes explains. Corns don't look like much to write home about, but they have been likened to having a constant rock in the shoe, and sometimes require surgery to get rid of. \nSo, let's say you severely stub or smash your toe and you fear that it's fractured. What next? Don't try to tough it out \u2014 visit a doctor and get an X-ray. A fracture that isn't properly treated could subject you to premature arthritis if the joint is impacted. \n\"If the little toe is severely bruised or injured, it needs to be cared for based on the kind of injury,\" explains Dr. Jha. \"If it is only superficial skin, it repairs itself over time with good hygiene and antibiotic ointments. If the muscle or bone is however injured, conservative management is advised to try and preserve the defected part. Mostly a splint is applied which is a bandage that is tied to the adjacent toe, so that movement is restricted and healing can then occur.\" \nAnd in the event that you have to have your little toe amputated, podiatrist Hinkes says most people can adjust to walking without it. However, \"losing a pinky can be psychologically distressing and we often refer patients to a counselor before and after the procedure... [They also] may use a special custom insole after the operation site heals.\" Now That's Cool If you've been diagnosed with a toe fracture, check out this helpful video on how to use self-adherent wrap to complete a \"buddy splint.\" This will immobilize the toe and reduce potential for swelling.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alia hoyt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bruce pinker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hinkes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruth jenkinson/getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aditi gupta jha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark hinkes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorling kindersley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "progressive foot care", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nanuet", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T20:22:18.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e95540ad7c466eccddd4a0aee5eb67c91e06da2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqAUtn5xquZ_FuaZJ3kE9Nai28b8y50hI6ZUIh9I4WXixAYz22.vSdweyZ4ohvlsaeK72tUIm0oQ--", "site_full": "shows.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "Bitcoin", "title_full": "Bitcoin", "published": "2017-10-16T21:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/tsd-bitcoin.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e95540ad7c466eccddd4a0aee5eb67c91e06da2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRqAUtn5xquZ_FuaZJ3kE9Nai28b8y50hI6ZUIh9I4WXixAYz22.vSdweyZ4ohvlsaeK72tUIm0oQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-16T21:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin", "text": "+ Subscribe Bitcoin Alexander Demianchuk/Getty Images \nThe cryptocurrency Bitcoin is never out of the news cycle for long.

ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images \nOn Oct. 12, 2017, the MGM Resorts International issued a statement disputing the Las Vegas police report that there was a six-minute delay between the time gunman Stephen Paddock shot security guard Jesus Campos at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and the time he opened fire from the 32nd floor into a crowd of concertgoers, killing 58 people and injuring more than 500. MGM, which owns Mandalay Bay, says the time delay was more like 40 seconds, according to new information it received. (Police confirmed there was no six-minute gap today.) \nThe hotel was responding to one of the unanswered questions and concerns that people have voiced about hotel security: Why was there a delay? How was the gunman able to make several trips back and forth to his hotel room to bring in 23 weapons without anyone noticing? And, why, if many of the moments of the shooter's preparations were captured on hotel surveillance camera , was nothing done? \nHotel security in the U.S. today seems to be where airport security was before 9/11. Will it change after the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history? And how should it? Metal Detectors in Hotels? \nMac Segal is head of hotel security consulting for the global security firm AS Solution. He says that metal detectors, luggage searches and armed guards are already standard at Western-style five-star hotels across Africa and the Middle East. That's because upscale hotels have proven to be attractive targets for terrorists. \n\"In the last three years, over 300 people have been killed or injured in terror-related attacks on hotels in Africa,\" says Segal, citing deadly incidents in Mali, Egypt, Burkina Faso and Libya. Malian troops take security measurements outside the Radisson Blu Hotel in Bamako, Mali, on Nov. 20, 2015. Gunmen took 170 hostages and at least 20 people, including 18 hostages and two attackers, were killed in the siege. Habibou Kouyate/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images \nBut in the United States, terror threats and active shooter situations hadn't even made it onto the radar for most hotels. Until now. \n\"In the U.S., hotel security has ended with petty theft, potential sexual harassment and drunk guys in the bar,\" says Segal. \nPerhaps one of the reasons that Stephen Paddock could carry so many weapons up to his luxury suite in the Mandalay Bay is that most hotel security in the U.S. is focused on protecting the guests, not profiling them as potential threats. \n\"In hotel security, they're looking at two things,\" says Bill Nesbitt, a security consultant and expert witness with Security Management Services International. \"They want to protect the guests against outside incursions. They also want to protect the guests against any dishonest employees.\" Would Tougher Security Measures Have Helped? \nWhen Paddock opened fire through two broken hotel windows at 20,000 concertgoers attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival, he became the first lone gunman in U.S. history to use a hotel as a staging ground for an attack. It's unclear at this point whether Mandalay Bay could have done anything to predict or prevent the shooting, given that Paddock's profile and behavior didn't follow the typical pattern for a mass shooter. \nAnother important fact, says Segal, is that the target of Paddock's attack wasn't the hotel. \n\"I don't think the conversation right now should just be about hotel security,\" Segal says. \"The Mandalay Bay was not attacked. The hotel was not attacked in any shape or form. No guest was injured or threatened. The only person injured [in the hotel] was that incredibly brave security officer.\" \nWhile the Las Vegas shooting should absolutely be a wake-up call for hotels, Segal says he thinks that bigger questions need to be asked about event security and particularly event evacuation plans. Hundreds of people were injured trying to flee the outdoor music festival, with some scrambling over barbed-wire fences and others trampled in a panicked rush for the exits. Segal believes that venues need to design exits and evacuation plans specifically for active shooter situations, not just fires. \nStill, says Nesbitt, hotels need to be on guard against copycats who are inspired by Paddock's rampage \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just as there have been many copycat killings after Columbine. More Effective Security Measures \nYet, Segal says that hotels can tighten security against future terrorist or lone gun attackers without turning hotel lobbies into military checkpoints. \n\"Increased security doesn't mean that we have to inconvenience the guests, make the guests feel intimidated, make the kids feel scared or make the hotel look like a prison,\" says Segal. \"On the contrary, you can do this in an intelligent, aesthetic manner that still allows for a positive guest experience and still keeps people safe.\" \nWhile some hotels may install more cameras and metal detectors, the best protection against future attacks, says Segal, is a well-trained hotel staff. Every hotel employee, from housekeeping to blackjack dealers, needs to be trained in how to recognize \"suspicious indicators\" of an imminent attack. \n\"You see nervousness, aggression, tunnel vision, repeated body movements, avoidance of eye contact,\" says Segal. \"Maybe the guy pays for the room in cash, doesn't want to give ID.\" \nAgain, whether that type of training would have prevented the gunman's attack is unclear, since all accounts describe Paddock as cool, calm and drawing no attention or suspicion before the attack. \nSteve Wynn, CEO of Wynn Resorts, told Fox News that his Las Vegas hotels implemented heightened security protocols in 2015 after identifying The Strip as a soft target for terrorists. Those protocols included a \"no gun\" policy for all guests and security training for all hotel staff members. In addition, all entrances and exits are monitored with cameras and hidden metal detectors to alert security personnel to suspicious individuals. \nWhile Wynn refused to say whether his hotels' security measures could have prevented an attack like Paddock's, he did point to the fact that Paddock had holed up in his room for 36 hours, which should have been a red flag. \n\"We also have rules about 'do not disturb,'\" Wynn told Fox News. \"If a room goes on 'do not disturb' for more than 12 hours, we investigate.\" Now That's Interesting College student Paige Gasper, who was injured in the Las Vegas music festival massacre, has filed a lawsuit against MGM Resorts and others for liability in this mass shooting.

LSG \nAntarctica is no place for a tomato. But starting in January 2018, researchers at the German Antarctic research station, Neumayer III, will begin growing not only tomatoes but also lettuces, herbs, peppers, cucumbers, swiss chard, radishes and even strawberries inside a climate-controlled shipping container. Although other indoor gardens have existed in Antarctica, the EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility will be the most advanced indoor farm on the continent \u2014 an experiment meant to push the limits of indoor agriculture, so that the technology can hold up for a long mission to Mars . \n\"Some of my colleagues like to say, 'It's no longer your grandmother's garden anymore,'\" says Matthew Bamsey, a research associate at DLR, also known as the German Aerospace Center, and a member of the EDEN ISS team, a multipartner project focused on developing plant cultivation technologies for future use in space. \nOut on the Ekstr\u00f6m Ice Shelf in the Atlantic sector, the greenhouse will stand against Antarctica's frigid temperatures, the long dark winter and extremely low humidity. From the outside it's a simple structure, just two 20-foot (6-meter) shipping containers placed end to end. But inside, it's a high-tech oasis capable of producing 661 pounds (300 kilograms) of produce annually. To give you an idea of how much that is, in 2013, the average U.S. person consumed 272 pounds (123 kilograms) of fruits and vegetables. \nFine-tuning the operation for space is one of the main goals of the project. \n\"We don't want an astronaut working 16 hours a day in the greenhouse,\" he says. \nThe experiment will allow them to figure out just how much time is needed to tend the garden. Over the next year, they'll get closer to that answer. \nThe indoor garden is based on a soil-free growing system called aeroponics. The system, first invented in the 1920s but advanced by NASA in the 1990s, is extremely water-efficient, using 98 percent less water than soil-based gardens. Plants grow in trays on racks, with their roots suspended within a protected chamber that prevents light from entering. At regular intervals, the hanging roots are spritzed with a fine water and nutrient-rich mist. Any water not taken in by the roots is captured and recirculated. The Future Exploration Greenhouse pictured here (not in Antarctica) is the area where the plants grow in the EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility. The greenhouse has 135 square feet (12.5 square meters) available for cultivation. Bruno Stubenrauch \nSensors monitor the nutrient levels and provide data to a computer that analyzes the mix and adjusts it according to the plants being grown and their stage of growth. Cameras monitor the plant's growth, while other sensors capture temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide levels, which are fed to a computer that keeps the ideal levels precisely tuned. Air filters keep the environment free of bacteria and fungus, while an ultraviolet light helps sterilize the air and kill any organism not caught in the filter. Because of the sterile environment, neither insecticides nor pesticides are required. \nThe plants grow beneath LED lights that illuminate the leaves in blue, red and white light, which when mixed together, bathe the room in pinkish-violet sci-fi glow, says Bamsey. The lights shine for 16 hours a day and then turn off for eight hours to simulate night. \nAs of this writing, the greenhouse, comprising two shipping containers, is making its way by ship to Cape Town, South Africa, where it will be transferred to another ship bound for Antarctica, and due to arrive on Dec. 24, 2017. Bamsey and several of his colleagues, including DLR scientist Paul Zabel, will be there to meet the shipment and oversee its transport by tracked vehicle approximately 12 miles (20 kilometers) across the ice shelf. Bamsey says the shipping containers will be placed end to end atop an 8.2-foot (2.5-meter) tall platform that will prevent the greenhouse from becoming buried in snow. One shipping container, named the Future Exploration Greenhouse, houses the plants and the other, the Service Section, contains the control systems that keep them alive. As this drawing shows, the greenhouse will be split into three separate sections: a cold porch/airlock, a service section and the actual greenhouse. LSG \nAll of the DLR scientists, including Bamsey, will return home after seven weeks, with the exception of Zabel, who will stay behind at Neumayer III, along with nine other researchers. There, Zabel will keep an eye on the greenhouse, which will sit about (1,312 feet) 400 meters away from the main station. Along with making sure all of the systems are running smoothly, he'll prune the plants, harvest them when they're ready and take samples that will be sent back to partner research labs. Having some interaction with the plants provides a psychological benefit, says Bamsey. And even though a fully autonomous system is possible, the engineers likely will not design one. Previous research has shown that for people stationed in remote areas like Antarctica, tending to plants, interacting with them and just observing them improves a person's state of mind. \nBamsey referred to a 2013 South Korean study , conducted after an indoor garden was installed at the King Sejong Station on Antarctica. It found that 83 percent of station crew members found the fresh produce to be \"very helpful\" or \"somewhat helpful\" to their mental health. \nThe psychological benefits of having greenery in Antarctica goes back to the 1902 Discovery Expedition of the continent, led by Robert Falcon Scott, where some of the crew members grew cress and mustard in the ship's ward under natural light, says Bamsey. In some of the crewmen's journal entries, they talk of the plants, the energy and time they took to care for them and the boost to morale they provided. \n\"Some of the crew members and explorers of that time talk about how this was the first green material they had eaten in two years,\" says Bamsey. \nThe greenhouse has funding until the end of 2018. Produce samples will be sent back to labs in Europe to test for their nutritional value and if all goes well, the researchers will be back again for another frigid growing season.

Well, consider this: It might take just seconds to empty the box to get to that toy, but it can take up to 18 months to get it there. \nThat's according to Mike Siemienas, a spokesman for General Mills, who says his company considers all kinds of variables before deciding what prizes make it into their cereals, including the toy category in general, play trends and influences from kids. \nAfter all, it's all about the kids. They've been clamoring for the those prizes and games since 1909 when Kellogg's became the first company to begin using \"premiums\" in its cereal products. General Mills followed in the 1930s , and has tempted the tiniest of diners with the best of American pop culture treats, including Lone Ranger comic books, Green Hornet rings, Hello Kitty stickers, and of course, \"Star Wars\" goodies. The most nostalgic cereal toys are now collectibles. \nToys became such a significant part of marketing cereal that General Mills had its own toy division from 1965 through the mid-'80s, acquiring Rainbow Crafts (the company that made Play-Doh), Kenner and Parker Brothers to create it. Aside from producing toys for its cereals, General Mills toy division produced some of the most memorable toys of that time, including Betty Crocker Easy-Bake Ovens, the Spirograph, Nerf balls, and action figures for the popular '70s TV series \"Six-Million Dollar Man\" and \"Bionic Woman.\" \nPerhaps the company's most successful collaboration is its partnership with the \"Star Wars\" franchise. In 1977, the year the eponymous first film in the series (now known more elaborately as \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\") debuted in theaters, General Mills and its toy division, Kenner, jumped at the chance several companies turned down: a licensing opportunity with the film . The gamble paid off. \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\" was a huge success. A year later, General Mills (via Kenner) created the 12 original \" Star Wars \" action figures and a plastic Millennium Falcon spaceship, and its Cheerios, Trix, Cocoa Puffs and Lucky Charms cereals had \"Star Wars\" movie posters, stick-on toys, cards, hang gliders and kites inside for fans. General Mills offered several cereal prizes from 2015's 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'. General Mills \nThrough the years, not only have toys changed to reflect what's in the box office, the toys have also changed with children's expectations. Now, there's a \"greater interest in the collectability of an in-box premium,\" Siemienas says via email, and the quality of the play experience matters, too. Parents, and by proxy, their children, affect what toys become box premiums through studies where parents share what their children like and don't like. \n\"Our goal is to team up with the best partners that are relevant to current cultural trends and give-away items that the whole family may enjoy,\" Siemienas says. \"Some items are for short-term fun and others are collectibles that people keep for years.\"But, he says, other things impact the toys they choose, too, including their collectability, size, safety standards and the fun they bring to consumers. \nGeneral Mills no longer has a toy division (General Mills spun off Kenner Parker Toys in 1985) but its licensing partnership with \"Star Wars\" is solid . After 40 years, the company is now including \"Star Wars\" toys and premiums designed to appeal not only to children, but to the first generation of \"Star Wars\" fans \u2014 the parents who are now sharing their favorite film franchise with their children. \"This behavior is most prevalent when the adult and child have a shared interest in an established versus new property,\" Siemienas says. \nAs for what you can expect in or on cereal boxes in the future, General Mills doesn't like to spoil the surprise. Though it's safe to assume that \"Star Wars\" will appear on the cereal aisle again soon, with \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" coming to theaters in December. But, as Siemienas told us, \"If we weren't excited about a premium item, we would not put it in a box.\" Now That's Interesting The very first cereal box prize was a book \u2014 \"The Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Book\" \u2014 offered by Kellogg's in 1909 .

Kiger POSTED Oct 13, 2017 Whether fully autonomous or merely just technologically advanced, the trucks of the future will still require some human oversight, industry experts say. Education Images/UIG/Getty Images \nIf you saw the recent X-Men movie \"Logan,\" you probably remember one startling scene that showed driverless robotic trucks hurtling down the highway in the year 2029. \nThat futuristic vision isn't here yet, and experts say there are significant technological and regulatory challenges that would have to be overcome before autonomous trucks dominate our highways. But already, truck manufacturers have been making significant strides toward automating much of the work human truck drivers currently perform \u2014 and those advances eventually may lead to future fleets of big rigs that transport their loads safely without a person behind the wheel. New Tech on the Road \nVehicle manufacturer Daimler tested an experimental big rig in Nevada in 2015, but the company isn't going to put such autonomous vehicles (AVs) into production any time soon. An automated, driverless \"super truck\" manufactured by Foton Motor Group is displayed at a vehicle expo in Shanghai, China, in 2016. (Xinhua/Chen Fei/Getty Images) \n\"An AV requires significant system redundancies in the event of a component failure, a significant increase in sensing to provide an accurate 360-degree view of the environment \u2014 particularly challenging with a trailer \u2014 and a significant increase in computational power and artificial intelligence,\" says Derek Rotz, director of advanced engineering for Daimler Trucks North America, via email. \"In short, we see significant development hurdles to be autonomous, which adds cost and complexity to the vehicle.\" \nIn a 2016 corporate blog post on the future of autonomous trucks, Scott Perry, chief technology and procurement officer for the commercial trucking giant Ryder, wrote that \"increased road safety regulations have played a large role in driving advancements in onboard vehicle technologies.\" \nIn an interview, he says that the industry already is outfitting human-driven trucks with technology such as adaptive cruise control , forward-looking radar, and collision-avoidance and lane-departure warning systems, in an effort to make trucks safer. Minding the Gap \nAnother promising automation advance that could help human truck drivers is platooning technology, which enables trucks to communicate with each other and follow one another at distances close enough to reduce air drag and boost fuel efficiency. \n\"Collapsing the following distance from 150 to 50 feet (46 meters to 15 meters) would improve the fuel economy of the lead vehicle by 4 percent, and the trailing vehicle by 10 percent,\" Perry says. If a car got between them, the trucks' platooning technology automatically would adapt and lengthen their following distance, he says. Past generations imagined a futuristic setting for the trucking industry, as in this 1943 illustration advertising axles for the Timken-Detroit Axle Company, but they often depicted human drivers. Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago /Getty Images \nDaimler recently began testing platooning on selected highways in Oregon and Nevada. The company's director of advanced engineering emphasizes that Daimler intends the technology to augment a human at the wheel, rather than replace him or her. \"Daimler Trucks North America believes the driver will remain indispensable to the vehicle, as their responsibilities go beyond steering, accelerating and braking,\" says Rotz. \"Therefore the platooning system is developed specifically with the driver in mind.\" \nBut without totally replacing drivers, automating many of their tasks could make their work easier, and help them to work longer and more safely. That could help the trucking industry cope with a growing shortage of drivers that's projected to reach 175,000 nationwide by 2024, according to trade publication Logistics Management, up from 2017's shortage of 48,000 drivers. \nThose technologies also could pave the way eventually for trucks that are fully autonomous . Besides easing driver shortages, autonomy also could help reduce highway congestion. Perry envisions driverless trucks that would communicate with each other and slow their speed in unison as they approached a major city, allowing traffic to continue to flow smoothly. Or the driverless fleets could travel late at night, he says, when there aren't as many commuters in cars on the road. Powered by Batteries \nBy making truck travel more efficient, autonomous technology might also extend the range of future generations of battery-powered electric trucks that would help reduce carbon emissions. \nIn Sweden, startup truck maker Einride has developed a prototype electric driverless big rig called the T-pod, a 23-foot-long (7-meters-long) rig that weighs in at 20 tons (18.1 metric tons) fully loaded, and is envisioned as a cleaner alternative to conventional diesel-burning big rigs. What's particularly attention-getting about the T-pod is that it not only lacks a steering wheel and pedals and a windshield, but doesn't even have a cabin for a human to ride in. \n\"The T-pod will be autonomous,\" says Einride chief executive Robert Falck, in an email, \"but will have a remote driver that is able to take over in certain situations where the system needs assistance \u2014 such as construction, getting on and off highways, or any other unpredictable situations. \nEinride is perfoming a pilot program for an unnamed customer in late 2017, and has set a goal of having a network for 200 T-pods up and running by 2020, Falck says.

NSF/LIGO/Sonoma State University/A. Simonnet \nScientists have detected the weak gravitational wave signal of two neutron stars colliding, and space telescopes have measured the flash of gamma rays erupting from the violent merger. This is the first time that both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation have been observed emanating from the same cosmic event. It's also the first time we've recorded the gravitational waves from a neutron star merger. \nUntil now, gravitational wave observatories have only discerned black hole mergers. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO), which manages two detecting stations in Washington and Louisiana, made history in 2015 for making the first detection of gravitational waves rippling through spacetime \u2013 a key theoretical prediction from Einstein's general relativity. \nSince that historic discovery, three more black hole mergers have been confirmed. The most recent black hole merger event was recorded on Aug. 14, and it saw the Advanced Virgo detector (located near Pisa in Italy) join LIGO to make the most precise measurement of a black hole smash-up yet. \nA mere three days later, on Aug. 17, LIGO and Virgo detected another signal. This time it was coming from two colliding neutron stars, proving that black holes aren't the only events making gravitational waves. An international collaboration of 70 ground- and space-based telescopes supercharged the discovery by capturing the gamma-ray burst and afterglow of the neutron star collision that happened 130 million light-years away in a galaxy called NGC 4993. \nOn Monday, Oct. 16, the LIGO/Virgo study was published in the journal Physical Review Letters. This before and after comparison of the galaxy NGC 4993 shows the location of the neutron star merger in optical and near-infrared light that generated the gravitational wave signal GW170817. 1M2H/UC Santa Cruz and Carnegie Observatories/Ryan Foley \n\"This detection opens the window of a long-awaited 'multi-messenger' astronomy,\" said David H. Reitze, executive director of the LIGO Laboratory, in a statement . \n\"It's the first time that we've observed a cataclysmic astrophysical event in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves \u2013 our cosmic messengers. Gravitational-wave astronomy offers new opportunities to understand the properties of neutron stars in ways that just can't be achieved with electromagnetic astronomy alone,\" he added. The Dark Universe \nUnless they are surrounded by hot gas, black hole mergers don't necessarily produce electromagnetic radiation (such as light, X-rays and infrared), so although they may be the most energetic events in our universe, they won't be picked up by conventional telescopes. With gravitational waves, however, scientists have opened a new window into the \"dark\" cosmos, giving us the ability to \"see\" the spacetime ripples these powerful events produce. Gravitational wave detectors use ultraprecise lasers firing along miles-long \"L\"-shaped tunnels to measure the slight spacetime warping that gravitational waves cause when passing through our planet. \nDetecting gravitational waves is one thing, but the pinnacle of any astronomical study is to have multiple observatories viewing the same event across multiple frequencies. And now, for the first time, the gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves from the same astrophysical event have been recorded to reveal a staggering amount of information about colliding neutron stars. \n\"This detection has genuinely opened the doors to a new way of doing astrophysics,\" said Laura Cadonati, deputy spokesperson for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, in the release . \"I expect it will be remembered as one of the most studied astrophysical events in history.\" Neutron Stars Dance, Too \nThrough analysis of the LIGO and Virgo signals, researchers could decipher that two massive objects, between 1.1 and 1.6 times the mass of our sun, had become trapped in a binary orbit and spiraled into one another, creating a telltale 100-second \"chirp\" \u2013 a rapid increase in gravitational wave frequency that's typical of a merger. A localization sky map of all the confirmed gravitational wave signals detected to date. GW170814 and GW170817 have areas of uncertainty much smaller than the other detections. That's because Virgo also was added to the network. LIGO/Virgo/NASA/Leo Singer (Milky Way image: Axel Mellinger) \nAfter black holes, neutron stars are the densest objects in the universe. Measuring the approximate size of a city, these objects can be more massive than our sun. In fact, neutron star material is so dense that a teaspoonful of the stuff will have a mass of a billion tons . They are remnants of massive stars that exploded as supernovas, so they also possess powerful magnetic fields and can spin rapidly, sometimes generating powerful blasts of radiation from their poles \u2013 known as pulsars. \nWhen this gravitational wave signal \u2013 called GW170817 \u2013 was detected, LIGO and Virgo scientists knew this wasn't \"just another\" black hole merger; these objects were too small to be black holes and within the range of neutron star mass. \n\"It immediately appeared to us the source was likely to be neutron stars, the other coveted source we were hoping to see \u2014 and promising the world we would see,\" said David Shoemaker, spokesperson for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, in a statement . \"From informing detailed models of the inner workings of neutron stars and the emissions they produce, to more fundamental physics such as general relativity, this event is just so rich. It is a gift that will keep on giving.\" \nThe Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on NASA's Fermi space telescope also detected a burst of gamma rays from the location of the gravitational wave source. The gravitational wave signal and gamma rays hit Earth at approximately the same time, confirming Einstein's theory that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light . \nIn addition, as soon as Fermi detected the gamma rays, the European gamma-ray space observatory INTEGRAL studied the signal, confirming that this event was a short gamma-ray burst. \n\"For decades we've suspected short gamma-ray bursts were powered by neutron star mergers,\" said Julie McEnery, Fermi project scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center, in a statement . \"Now, with the incredible data from LIGO and Virgo for this event, we have the answer. The gravitational waves tell us that the merging objects had masses consistent with neutron stars, and the flash of gamma rays tells us that the objects are unlikely to be black holes, since a collision of black holes is not expected to give off light.\" Kilonova Gold and a Mystery \nTheoretically, when two neutron stars collide the event generates an explosion known as a \"kilonova,\" an intense fireball that blows superheated material out from the point of impact and into surrounding space. \nAstronomers suspect kilonovas of creating the heaviest elements found throughout our universe \u2013 including gold and lead \u2013 so in our quest to understand how these elements are seeded throughout the universe, astronomers have (literally) uncovered a science goldmine. \nThe U.S. Gemini Observatory, the European Very Large Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope have studied the neutron star merger aftermath and are already reporting observations of newly created material containing the signatures of gold and platinum. This is therefore a very significant event that's providing evidence for how heavy elements are synthesized in galaxies. \nThis event has provided observational evidence of an assortment of theories, from proving that neutron stars do, in fact, collide, to highlighting where the precious metals in our universe come from. \nBut GW170817 also has created its own mystery. \nThe neutron star merger happened in a galaxy only 130 million light-years away (the previously detected black hole mergers occurred billions of light-years away), yet the signal received by LIGO and Virgo was much weaker than predicted. Scientists aren't sure why, but this is only the beginning of our gravitational wave odyssey, so we can expect many more mysteries and discoveries as waves from energetic events keep being detected.

Cannabis farmers in Sonoma County and The Emerald Triangle are losing crops to the fires, as well. Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \nThe wildfires that have incinerated hundreds of thousands of acres in the Northern California in October have destroyed thousands of homes, acres of pristine vineyards and something else central to California life and culture \u2014 fields of marijuana . \nThe wildfires, which have burned more than 213,000 acres (86,198 hectares) and 5,700 structures and killed 41 people, have also raged in the so-called Emerald Triangle \u2014 Mendocino, Humboldt and Trinity counties \u2014 where much of the marijuana in the United States is grown. \nIn 2016, California voters legalized the recreational use of pot, and sales are scheduled to begin in January with estimates suggesting it could create a $5 billion market . Most farmers who decided to cash in on the fledging industry are small-scale and have put their life savings into the farms. The Redwood Valley Fire has burned more 38,500 acres (15,580 hectares) in Mendocino County , alone. \nThat's very bad news for pot farmers because harvest time is in November, so many of the plants are still in the field and in various stages of production. Though it's hard to estimate exactly how many growers are impacted by the fires, in Sonoma County, there are thought to be between 3,000 and 9,000 cannabis farms , and that's not counting undocumented growers. \n\"This time of year, everyone's harvesting. And now, the annual paycheck that we've been working all year to earn may have been burnt to a crisp or will soon dry out due to lack of water,\" farmer Ahren Osterbrink told the Cannabist . \nTo complicate matters even more, marijuana is still considered an illegal drug by the federal government , and pot growers do business mainly in cash, so insurance companies are reluctant to sell the growers policies. In addition, many farmers have spent thousands of dollars to get their farms and businesses to comply with the new California state laws. They have paid for permits, forms and licenses to make their farms and businesses legal. But farmers cannot write these and other business expenses off on their federal taxes, and they also cannot get federal crop insurance. \n\"Since hemp is classified as a prohibited substance under federal law, it is not eligible for federal crop insurance,\" Heather Manzano, acting administrator of the United States Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency , which oversees crop insurance, said in a statement. \nAlthough cannabis growing is a fledgling industry, Arcview Market Research , predicts that the marijuana market in California will hit $6.5 billion by 2020, up from $2.76 billion in 2015. \nBut even the fields of marijuana that escape the fires may still not be salvageable \u2014 the fallout from smoke could devastate what doesn't burn. Smoke can contaminate plants with a variety of substances making them unsuitable for use. Exactly what the financial impact will be when the fires die out is still yet to be seen. Now That's Interesting California, as well as Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada and the District of Columbia, have the most liberalized marijuana laws . In California, adults 21 years and older can possess up to an ounce and grow up to six plants in their homes.

Kean Collection/Getty Images \nWhen Malcolm X said in 1965 that white people \"have to be willing to do as old John Brown did\" to be a true ally for blacks' rights, his allusion to the abolitionist might've been startling to some. Initially, many people wrote Brown off as a hysteric or terrorist for the raid he led on Harper's Ferry, Virginia, in 1859. But others came to recognize him as a man who was willing to shed blood for the cause of abolition. Did his violent and radical means merit such worthy ends? \nHolly Frey and Tracy V. Wilson let you ponder that question as they revisit John Brown's Raid on Harper's Ferry in this episode of Stuff You Missed in History Class . While there were many turning points on the road to the Civil War, Harper's Ferry was a terribly divisive event that spurred radicalism on both the anti-slavery and pro-slavery sides. \nJohn Brown was a strict Calvinist, raised in an abolitionist household. While he wasn't a thundering success when it came to business (he was bankrupt by his 40s ), he believed that he was on Earth for something big. \"This devotion to ending slavery, and his Calvinist upbringing, would eventually combine into a complete and utter certainty that he was predestined to bring about slavery's end,\" says Holly. \nAnd one way he planned to do that was to expand the Underground Railroad into what he called the \" Subterranean Pass-Way \" that would stretch for thousands of miles into the Deep South to ferry slaves to liberation. But it wasn't just about freedom, Holly points out. \"As part of this plan, some of these liberated people would become part of an armed fighting force of free black people that would forcibly end slavery in the South by raiding plantations of their power and their workforce.\" Before John Brown, pictured here, was hanged, he gave his guard this note: \u201cI, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood.\u201d \u00a9 CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images \nIn 1858, Brown convinced abolitionist leaders to fund his plan to create and arm a fighting force with a raid on Harper's Ferry, which was home to a federal arsenal. He even enlisted Harriet Tubman to spread the word around the region and help foment a groundswell of support when the raid came. \nSo, in October 1859, Brown and 19 other men took over a railroad station, musket factory and rifle works in Harper's Ferry. They abducted slave owners as hostages, but they weren't met with loads of supporters or help. They hadn't done enough work on the ground, it seemed, to support a widespread insurrection or even sympathy. Robert E. Lee , then a colonel, was put in charge of ending the raid, and his team of U.S. Marines successfully brought Brown and his men into custody. Ten of Brown's men were killed, along with six civilians. \nJohn Brown was sentenced to death just weeks after the event, and he died by hanging on Dec. 2, 1859. The raid was a failure at starting a massive slave revolt, and it encouraged fears of a slave uprising and bolstered future Confederate militias. But as Tracy and Holly discuss in this episode of Stuff You Missed in History Class , it also made John Brown a martyr \u2014 which might've contributed to an upsurge of support for abolition in Northern states.

Kiger POSTED Oct 17, 2017 What if the reality we experience every day were really just a simulation running inside a giant supercomputer? Photographer is my life/Getty Images \nThe \"Matrix\" trilogy of sci-fi thrillers present the fascinating premise that what most people think of as reality is actually a computer simulation , created by super-intelligent evil machines who want to harvest human bodies for electrical power. \nBut the notion that our reality is a simulation isn't just some clever plot device for screenwriters. A 2003 article in Philosophical Quarterly by Oxford University faculty member Nick Bostrom proposed that very thought right in its title: \"Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?\" He went on to argue that it was a distinct possibility that we were living in a simulation, at least based what we are capable of deducing from \"the dark forest of our current ignorance.\" \nMore recently, popular astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson raised the prospect that we might not only be living in a computer simulation, but that simulation itself might have been created in a computer that isn't real either, but simply is part of a simulated reality in the memory of an even more powerful machine. \nThat chain could go on endlessly, like someone standing in one of artist Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirror Rooms . And even technologist Elon Musk has suggested he finds the reality-is-fake theory plausible. \nBut if the simulated reality idea is just a bit too unsettling for you, one development may soothe your jangled nerves. A new paper published in the journal Science Advances indicates that modeling reality from the level of fundamental particles would require almost unfathomably enormous amounts of computing power. From that, argue theoretical physicists and study authors Zohar Ringel and colleague Dmitry Kovrizhin, you can extrapolate that creating a virtual reality, with all of the complexity that we can observe and calculate, would be pretty much impossible. \nThat wasn't the question that they researchers sought to answer. Instead, they sought to determine whether it was possible to use quantum Monte Carlo technique , a mathematical method, to model systems that have anomalies such as the quantum Hall effect . What they found was that they couldn't. That's because as the number of particles being simulated grew, the complexity of the simulation increased exponentially, so that the amount of computing power has to double each time a single particle is added. \nWhile their paper actually doesn't go into the implausibility of \"The Matrix,\" it seems to make the idea of a computer massively powerful enough to simulate reality seem about as likely as some real-life parkour enthusiast duplicating Trinity's chase scene stunts. Now That's Interesting As an article in Popular Science notes, the limitations described by Ringel and Kovrizhin assume a universe with similar laws of physics to ours.

Flavor Flav's dancing left a lot to be desired, but behind the tongue-in-cheek lyrics lurked a long-standing frustration in many communities of color, that police and ambulances seemed to take forever to respond to 911 calls in predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods. \nBut is it really true? Can an ambulance refuse to respond to a 911 call because it's in a \"bad\" part of town? \n\"The short answer is 'no,'\" says Cathy Chidester, director of the Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Agency, one of the largest emergency response systems in the United States. \nIn Los Angeles, the county contracts with private ambulance companies to serve specific geographic areas. Ambulances are required to respond to all 911 calls in those areas in less than nine minutes at least 90 percent of the time. A \"no show\" \u2014 defined as anything later than 15 minutes \u2014 carries a $3,000 fine. \nIn Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, every municipality in the county contracts with a private ambulance company to respond to 911 calls within its geographic boundaries. \nWhen a 911 call comes into the dispatcher, the caller's address is automatically linked to a specific ambulance company, explains George Dudash, executive director of NorthWest EMS, which covers 14 communities in the Pittsburgh area. Late responses don't trigger fines in Pittsburgh, but Dudash says his ambulances arrive in less than eight minutes to every call in every neighborhood. \nSo that's the situation today. But \"911 is a Joke\" came out 27 years ago, when memories of a very different reality would have been fresh in many people's minds. The ambulance system as we know it \u2014 well-equipped vehicles staffed with trained paramedics or EMTs \u2014 didn't exist anywhere in the U.S. until the late 1970s and early 1980s. Before that, emergency response was an unregulated hodgepodge of police paddy wagons and private vans, and discrimination was undoubtedly a problem. \nParamedics and EMTs weren't even a thing until an eye-opening 1966 report by the National Academy of Sciences found that a seriously injured person would have a better chance of surviving on a battlefield in Vietnam than in most American cities. That's because the Army had trained medics who could perform life-saving procedures in the field, but civilians had to get to a hospital before any treatment could begin. That report led to the first paramedic training courses and EMT certifications by the 1970s. \nChidester of L.A. County EMS says that before California put strict regulations and procedures in place for emergency response in 1980, private ambulance services often raced to be the first one to arrive to a call. \n\"They would siphon gas out of each other's ambulance, they would put things in the way, they would deflate tires, or they would argue over who was going to take the patient,\" says Chidester, comparing the antics to the 1976 Bill Cosby comedy \" Mother, Jugs & Speed .\" \nAmbulance companies were also free to ignore calls from \"undesirable\" neighborhoods. \n\"All they'd have to do is say that they were 'encumbered' [busy] so they couldn't go,\" says Chidester. \nThe current system of awarding exclusive service contracts to specific ambulance companies means that providers are held accountable, Chidester says. \"If they don't make it to a call, you go out there and you find out why.\" \nBut what about payment? A single trip in an ambulance can easily run $1,200 to $1,500 . You could see how an ambulance company might be concerned that clients from lower-income neighborhoods would be less likely to pay their bill. Could that lead to no shows? \nDudash from NorthWest EMS in Pittsburgh says absolutely not. Getting stiffed is just part of the ambulance business. Between high-deductible insurance policies, lowball Medicare reimbursements and people who simply can't pay, Dudash says he pockets about 35 cents for every dollar he bills. Rather than sending a collection agency after unpaid ambulance bills, the company simply writes it off as bad debt. \n\"That's the reason I've never gone to Vegas,\" jokes Dudash. \"Every time an ambulance goes out, it's a gamble.\" Now That's Cool The hit 1970s TV show \"Emergency!\", which chronicled the adventures of a team of handsome Los Angeles paramedics, did a lot to raise public awareness of the emerging field of professional emergency response.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dave roos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bill cosby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cathy chidester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chidester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dudash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george dudash", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national academy of sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northwest ems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles county emergency medical services agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l.a. county ems", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vietnam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T20:41:08.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6017fd286e8d3fe98b230070b4f8201da45b18f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzzQDffEpu_IKnSvhIfAl12Xr5S5a5ISg_Brv6DdvfuhlsMyc9zbRTnjheJGzCx9cDPmVSxQsBvBWE8D6lCAmwalQI5KYzARTGCQJL7ny7rEAn0hYP58rG", "site_full": "history.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "Inside Yellowstone's 'Zone of Death' Crimes Can't Be Prosecuted", "title_full": "Inside Yellowstone's 'Zone of Death' Crimes Can't Be Prosecuted", "published": "2017-10-17T20:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/zone-of-death.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 300, "comments": 1, "shares": 300}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6017fd286e8d3fe98b230070b4f8201da45b18f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzzQDffEpu_IKnSvhIfAl12Xr5S5a5ISg_Brv6DdvfuhlsMyc9zbRTnjheJGzCx9cDPmVSxQsBvBWE8D6lCAmwalQI5KYzARTGCQJL7ny7rEAn0hYP58rG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Diana Brown", "published": "2017-10-17T20:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Inside Yellowstone's 'Zone of Death' Crimes Can't Be Prosecuted", "text": "Inside Yellowstone's 'Zone of Death' Crimes Can't Be Prosecuted by Diana Brown POSTED Oct 17, 2017 Grizzly bears and wolves are the only residents in Yellowstone National Park's 'Zone of Death.' NPS \nYellowstone National Park, an idyllic and beautiful geographical gem situated in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, hides a dark secret: a 50-mile (80-kilometer) patch of lawless land, known as \"The Zone of Death,\" where anyone can commit a crime and go unpunished. \nHow is that possible? That's exactly what Stuff They Don't Want You To Know hosts Matt Frederick, Ben Bowlin and Noel Brown wondered, and they dig into the info in this episode of the podcast . \nThe area, dubbed \"Zone of Death\" was discovered by Michigan State law professor Brian Kalt , who was looking for a topic for a paper when he came across the unusual legal situation in Yellowstone. At first, Kalt planned to write about technicalities around the Sixth Amendment , which entitles every U.S. citizen to a speedy trial by their peers, with a jury selected of residents from where the crime took place. During his research he discovered the loophole that allows the Zone of Death to exist: It has no residents. The Zone of Death is located in a remote part of Idaho , and no one lives there, so it has no potential jury members . \nKalt was fascinated, but also horrified, by his realization. He'd discovered a place where criminals could escape punishment for crimes as heinous as murder . He redirected his research on the topic and published a paper in 2005 in Georgetown Law Journal titled \" The Perfect Crime ,\" but feared his work might inspire potential criminals. \nSo Kalt took matters into his own hands. Before his paper published, he sent his findings and research to legislators in Wyoming, but nothing happened. Only after his paper went public did he see any movement: Author C.J. Box wrote a novel in 2007 inspired by Kalt's findings. Republican Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming was a fan of Box; he read the book and contacted Kalt to discuss how to close this loophole. Congress could simply pass a law placing Idaho's portions of Yellowstone inside the District of Idaho. But 12 years after Kalt published his paper, nothing has been done to change the law. \nIt might seem far-fetched that a court would let a criminal go free based on a technicality, but one guy tried to do just that . Michael Belderrain illegally shot an elk in Yellowstone, and the government attempted to have him tried in Montana. His defense was that his Sixth Amendment rights would be violated by sending him out of the district in which the crime was committed. The judge threw out the defense, saying that sending him to a more populous district amounted to a \"harmless error.\" \nBut the fact is that any violation of constitutional rights cannot be seen as a harmless error, as Kalt points out, and in a higher-stakes case, the defense would certainly not allow the court to throw out that argument without an appeal. \nOf course there are plenty of problems to be solved by our legislative bodies other than hypothetical crimes that haven't been committed in a remote part of Yellowstone Park, but Kalt finds it hard to believe that they would wait for a person to be murdered before rewriting a few lines of the legal language guiding jurisdiction in Yellowstone. \nYou'll have to listen to the podcast to find out more about why the loophole hasn't been closed and what the Ninth Circuit courts have to do with the Zone of Death.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "diana brown", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "c.j. box", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian kalt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben bowlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noel brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt frederick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike enzi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael belderrain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kalt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yellowstone", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown law journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ninth circuit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "yellowstone national park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyoming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yellowstone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "district of idaho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idaho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yellowstone park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T22:15:49.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9660f9bb6cc46bbe42a44790d2af90c4258d52cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpQmnHkozjxpgw7ENdKKT12RghUeUG1g5Igpe.mDSmX1gYOZlHspwTaRFMcWMByTAUpvKYxjrkV3OG0OZbzyd3R1fPxoDCKWDbs9_ntHm3b2PoUkrNdmp3rLOjWMOWIqwqn4LnvM2A7DRZFVyVqxAG", "site_full": "science.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "Why King Tides Are Flooding Coastal Cities More Often", "title_full": "Why King Tides Are Flooding Coastal Cities More Often", "published": "2017-10-17T23:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/king-tides.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 142, "comments": 0, "shares": 142}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 16}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9660f9bb6cc46bbe42a44790d2af90c4258d52cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpQmnHkozjxpgw7ENdKKT12RghUeUG1g5Igpe.mDSmX1gYOZlHspwTaRFMcWMByTAUpvKYxjrkV3OG0OZbzyd3R1fPxoDCKWDbs9_ntHm3b2PoUkrNdmp3rLOjWMOWIqwqn4LnvM2A7DRZFVyVqxAG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "John Perritano", "published": "2017-10-17T23:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why King Tides Are Flooding Coastal Cities More Often", "text": "Why King Tides Are Flooding Coastal Cities More Often by John Perritano POSTED Oct 17, 2017 People walk through a flooded street in Fort Lauderdale caused by a king tide. Many cities in South Florida have begun installing pumps and building sea walls to try and combat the rising oceans. Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images \nPeople living along the coast are no strangers to significant weather \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they often deal with hurricanes, rising sea levels and tropical storms. But there's another natural phenomenon that is slowly taking its toll on many seaside towns \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the king tide . In fact, Miami was hit by a massive king tide in early October 2017 that flooded streets just weeks after Hurricane Irma slammed the area. \nKing tides are the highest astronomical tides of the year, the result of a perfect alignment between the Earth, sun and moon. Think of them as high tides on steroids. Every two weeks, the moon and the sun position themselves on the same side of the planet. Their combined gravitational pull tugs at Earth's oceans, resulting in tides that are about 20 percent higher than normal. Three or four times a year the moon, which has an elliptical orbit , snuggles up to Earth on its closest approach to the planet. When both of these astronomical events converge, a king tide rolls in. \n\"King tides can occur any time of the year, but tend to occur during the fall or spring near the full moon tides surrounding the equinox, when the moon is at perigee [closest to Earth in its orbit],\" Derek Loftis, a research scientist at the College of William and Mary's Virginia Institute of Marine Science, says in an email. \"The fall season's highest tides are slightly more pronounced due to the Earth being slightly closer to perihelion with the sun [on the solstice].\" \nKing tides can worsen if they happen during a coastal storm. The tide, along with a storm surge , pushes extra water inland. Meteorologists and other scientists are always concerned when storms line up with king tides. While scientists can calculate a king tide in advance, predicting storms before they blow through is much trickier. \nFor example, in October 2017 in Virginia and in other locations, Hurricane Jose, which never made landfall but churned hundreds of miles off the U.S. coast, contributed to king-tide flooding. Off Sewells Point near Norfolk, the water rose 0.73 feet (.22 meters) above what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration considers minor flood stage there. \nSuch situations are becoming increasingly common and more troublesome. In Florida, the number of king tides has soared 400 percent between 2006 and 2016 . Why the increase? Although there are many reasons why king tides are driving water further inland, none is more worrisome than climate change. As Earth warms, ice melts and the temperature of the ocean gets hotter. When that happens, water expands and rises. \n\"The king tides are garnering more attention now due to the derivative effects of sea level rise, and coastal land subsidence due to the draining of subsurface aquifers for drinking water in many coastal regions,\" Loftis says. \nBrian McNoldy, a scientist at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, says seasonal effects, such as the amount of precipitation, also play a role. In addition, when trees and plants begin to shut down for the winter and shed their leaves, they cannot absorb as much rain runoff as they do in the spring and summer. As a result, the increase runoff contributes to flooding during king tides. \nAlthough wind does not have a direct impact on king tides, it does play a role. In South Florida, McNoldy says, a persistent onshore wind increases the water level up to a foot (.03 meters) on top of the regular astronomic tides. The impact on communities can be devastating. Right after Hurricane Irma blew through, king tides flooded some neighborhoods of Anna Maria Island , Bradenton Beach and parts of South Florida for several days, creating unease in an already ravaged area. \nBoth McNoldy and Loftis say the king tide is the \"new normal,\" which is one reason why some communities have been pouring money into shoring up infrastructure, housing and habitat restoration projects to minimize damage. Early in 2017, Miami Beach announced a new $100 million flood prevention project to keep neighborhoods from flooding. The city plans to raise roads, install pumps and water pipes, and make sure sewer connections hold up. \n\"King tides have always been around,\" Loftis says. \"We have only just started calling them this in the past couple of years in the U.S. In Australia, where the name hails from, the king tide truly reigns supreme over the other tides, as they bring much higher water levels than the mean highest astronomical tides. Here in North America, the king tide is barely the king, and in many cases, is only a few inches higher than the high tides on the days before or after.\" Now That's Scary Within a century, scientists predict that king tides will add 2 to 12 feet (0.6 to 3.6 meters) more water to coastal areas as sea levels rise.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john perritano", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brian mcnoldy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derek loftis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcnoldy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loftis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "college of william and mary's virginia institute of marine science", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national oceanic and atmospheric administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosenstiel school of marine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "fort lauderdale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna maria island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bradenton beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norfolk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T23:56:49.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "62a788bcb91697e990b0eb3e4fe4eae6a23a2341", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRTQfhfxBFH_WLk1yyo3sPbHTpr39BnBWcOUB0DPSexkbqTtI5JjuvNcR4B4YRQOvyQt.9CFmV9gkqochU91M62wnPnUBDvCztCEO4DahMgoQ--", "site_full": "entertainment.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&cf=all&ned=us&hl=en&q=movie&cf=all&output=rss", "site_categories": ["media", "television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "movie - Google News", "title": "7 Times Misleading Movie Trailers Didn't Align with the Film - HowStuffWorks", "title_full": "7 Times Misleading Movie Trailers Didn't Align with the Film - HowStuffWorks", "published": "2017-10-18T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/movietrailers-1.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 209, "comments": 0, "shares": 209}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "62a788bcb91697e990b0eb3e4fe4eae6a23a2341", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRTQfhfxBFH_WLk1yyo3sPbHTpr39BnBWcOUB0DPSexkbqTtI5JjuvNcR4B4YRQOvyQt.9CFmV9gkqochU91M62wnPnUBDvCztCEO4DahMgoQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-18T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "7 Times Misleading Movie Trailers Didn't Align with the Film - HowStuffWorks", "text": "7 Times Misleading Movie Trailers Didn't Align with the Film by Chris Opfer POSTED Oct 18, 2017 Director Darren Aronofsky attends a post-screening Q&A of his controversial 2017 film \"Mother!\" at the Busan International Film Festival. Woohae Cho/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures \nDarren Aronofsky is nothing if not polarizing. Whether it's a mind-bending trip down a drug-fueled rabbit hole in \"Requiem for a Dream,\" or a dark peek at eroticism on the professional ballet circuit in \"Black Swan,\" the award-winning writer/director's films tend to elicit strong feelings. \nAronofsky's latest opus \"Mother!\" is garnering a new kind of feedback from moviegoers. As with many Aronofsky flicks, many viewers appear to be leaving the theaters confused about what it actually is that they just watched. Per usual, the film has also divided critics . But a vocal group of movie watchers are also miffed because they say the final product on the big screen looks very little like the trailer promoting the film that they watched on TV or online. \nThe team behind \"Mother!\" isn't the only one to be accused of using film trailers and other movie marketing tools to sell moviegoers a bill of goods. Here are seven films that didn't exactly line up with their previews. Actor Johnny Depp starred in \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,\" a 2007 movie whose marketing team avoided overtly cluing in audiences to the fact that it was a musical. Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images 1. \"Sweeney Todd,\" 2007 \nThe combination of Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and the story of a murderous barber out for revenge in Victorian London is something akin to a holy trinity in some cinephile circles. It was certainly enough to get many folks out to the theatre when the film dropped in 2007. The only problem is that Dreamworks left out one important detail in the film's trailer : \"Sweeney Todd\" is a musical. Johnny Depp sings. The entire time. So do most of the characters. Sure, Broadway veterans certainly understood going in that the movie was based on Sondheim ditties. The rest of the crowd was a little surprised. 2. \"Drive,\" 2011 \nNicolas Winding Refn's 2011 noir crime piece is a nuanced film about a guy who drives really well, and doesn't do much else. It won critical praise and rave reviews from audiences, but it also offered some filmgoers a little less than what they bargained for at the box office. Just about all of the action that takes place over the course of 100 minutes of movie was also jammed into two and a half minutes of movie trailer . The good news is action-craving crowds still got to see a guy get his head stomped in like a watermelon; the bad news for those same people is the film was more meditative and artistic than they'd expected. 3. \"The Tree of Life,\" 2011 \nIf Aronofsky has a kindred spirit behind the camera, it's fellow art-leaning director Terrence Malick. The man who delivered the Pacific World War II fever dream that is \"The Thin Red Line\" in 1998 followed it up with \"The Tree of Life\" 13 years later. The film \u2013 which stars Brad Pitt, Sean Penn and Jessica Chastain \u2014 tells the tale of a Texas family, the father's memory of his own upbringing, and how it all ties back to the creation of the universe. In other words, it's long and sometimes tough to follow, but it's also a beautifully shot piece of film. \nIf you watch the trailer , you're not likely to walk away with any idea of what the film is about other than a family and some strife. Then again, some moviegoers had the same experience after walking out of the theater; some cinemas even posted a no-refunds policy for the film, warning moviegoers ahead of time they were in for a nontraditional ride. 4. \"National Treasure: Book of Secrets,\" 2007 \nNic Cage may be a strange human being, but he is also a cinematic treasure. For all of the dreck that he churns out, it can be easy to forget that the actor who first turned heads in \"Raising Arizona\" every once in a while still has a delightfully over the top performance or two left in the tank. Unfortunately, \"National Treasure\" is not one of those films. It is not good. So not good that the movie's marketing team loaded its trailer with scenes that are not actually in the film . 5. \"Scream,\" 1996 \nIf you were a teenager in mid-'90s and remember going to see \"Scream\" on the big screen, you likely also remember expecting Drew Barrymore to play a starring role in the horror flick. She was featured heavily in movie posters and ads. She also did much of the press tours in advance of the film. Turns out Drew's turn in front of the camera for Wes Craven lasted about as long as the previews. \nThe misdirection was probably by design. \"Scream\" is a film about horror films, and the tropes that often feature heavily in them. Wes Craven wanted us to think that Barrymore would play the damsel in distress protagonist role, and he wanted us to be shocked when she met her very early demise. 6. \"Lost in Translation,\" 2003 \nSofia Coppola and the team behind \"Lost in Translation\" were robbed. Sure, everyone knew going into the 2003 Oscars that \"The Lord of the Rings\" was going home with the best picture award, but that doesn't mean it was the best picture. The Coppola flick is a dry, dark comedy about loneliness and Japanese whiskey. It is not the lighthearted romantic comedy that it was made out to be in this trailer . 7. \"The Rules of Attraction,\" 2002 \n\"The Rules of Attraction\" is a move about college starring James Van der Beek and Jessica Biel. What folks who are not Brett Easton Ellis disciples may not have known going into the film is that it's based on a book written by the guy who penned \"American Psycho.\" This is no simple \"Animal House,\" despite the trailer's focus on sex, drug and rock 'n' roll on campus. It's a jaunt over to the darker side of the dorm.

Cirque du Soleil \nIf you've ever seen a Cirque du Soleil show, you know to expect a rich integration of stunning visuals, evocative music and dazzling performances. But the Canadian entertainment company also exhibits technical mastery \u2014 and its show \"Luzia\" has the 50-foot (15-meter) onstage waterfall to prove it. \nThe show itself, currently on tour in North America, is a dreamlike journey through Mexico, full of high-end acrobatics, juggling , puppetry and clowns. The show highlights Mexican culture and native insect life, but the star is the water. In order to enable onstage rain and a wading pool, Cirque designed the entire set around a digital water curtain. If you're ever seen the aquatic Cirque show \"O,\" you'll know this isn't the first time the company has built a water-centric piece. The onstage wading pool is shown to great effect in this still from Cirque du Soleil's production \"Luzia.\" Cirque du Soleil \nDuring \"Luzia,\" audience witness a spectacle of falling rain, especially mesmerizing when it displays patterns and pictures in its cascade. Behind the scenes, the technical aspects of this effect are equally impressive. \n\"Every time we create a production, we strive to come-up with performances and stage pictures that will surprise our audience and evoke their emotions,\" says Cirque publicist Francis Jalbert. \"'Luzia' is a complex show as we incorporated technology we had never worked with before. Playing with water onstage under the Big Top brought us to find ways to recycle the water, heat it, clean it and pump it all the way at the top of the tent for the acts involving rain.\" \nAnd \"Luzia\" uses a lot of water \u2014 1,585 gallons (6,000 liters) for a single performance, in fact. And since the show recycles the water for all of a given city's shows, they have to run it all through a filtration and disinfection system. After all, an aerial strap performance is death-defying enough without the risk of cholera. The backstage team stores the water at a constant 82 degrees F (28 degrees C) before pumping it up to a rotating array of 174 spray nozzles 56 feet (17 meters) above the stage. \n\"We also had to figure out how to dry the stage quickly for acts requiring a dry surface,\" says Jalbert, \"and find out how to protect microphones and other technical equipment from getting wet. That's why the creation process of a show at Cirque du Soleil lasts over two years; we constantly come up with new technologies and learn how to master them as we go to bring the vision of the creators to life.\" \nBut the technology is only one aspect of the show. The human performers in \"Luzia\" also had to adjust to this new performance element. Which tricks could be performed wet? How might they avoid the risk of slippery acrobatic props and water-heavy garments? \nThe Cirque team dreamed up several creative solutions. For instance, they constructed a special \"wet\" trapeze out of sailing rope and a wooden bar for improved grip. The human-centered \" Cyr wheel \" used in the show is covered with a bike tire, because otherwise it would prove impossible to manipulate on a wet surface. A performer deftly handles the modified Cyr wheel without her hands and feet slipping. Cirque du Soleil \nWas all of this technical effort worth it? According to Jalbert, the answer is in the audience reaction. \n\"You can see the amazement on their faces as they first see the rain and feel the coolness of the water in the air. There is a particular moment where shapes and designs appear in the rain; it's literally raining images of animals and plants. The audience reacts loudly as they've never seen something like this before and are moved by the combination of this simple moment with our powerful musical score.\" \n\" Luzia \" is currently at Atlanta's Atlantic Station through November 2017, followed by runs in Los Angeles and Costa Mesa, California. Now That's Cool Cirque du Soleil first traveled to the U.S. in 1987.

TorriPhoto/Getty Images \nDepression treatment is better now than ever before, thanks to a variety of prescription drug options and improved therapy techniques. But in some cases, these proven therapies fall short. However, magic mushrooms just might be the key to giving those depression sufferers some much-needed relief, according to a recent study by researchers at Imperial College London. \nPublished in the journal Scientific Reports , the small study looked at the effects of psilocybin on 19 patients for whom conventional depression therapies failed. (Psilocybin is the psychoactive compound that is naturally present in 200 types of mushrooms .) The researchers describe the results as \"rapid and sustained.\" In fact, within weeks, the patients reported fewer depression symptoms, with several of them describing a \"brain reset.\" This reportedly lasts for up to five weeks post-treatment. \nOther studies have shown positive effects from using LSD and MDMA (the active ingredient in ecstasy) to treat some mental illnesses. But this is the first study to look at the effect of psilocybin on depression. \n\"We have shown for the first time clear changes in brain activity in depressed people treated with psilocybin after failing to respond to conventional treatments,\" says Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris, head of psychedelic research at Imperial and leader of the study, in a press release . \"Several of our patients described feeling 'reset' after the treatment and often used computer analogies. For example, one said he felt like his brain had been 'defragged' like a computer hard drive, and another said he felt 'rebooted'. Psilocybin may be giving these individuals the temporary 'kick start' they need to break out of their depressive states and these imaging results do tentatively support a 'reset' analogy. Similar brain effects to these have been seen with electroconvulsive therapy.\" \nParticipants were given two doses of psilocybin (serotonin agonist)a week apart. Functional MRIs done after each dose showed reduced blood flow in certain areas of the brain, particularly the amygdala, which is credited with processing fear, stress and emotional responses. Greater stability in a different brain network was also revealed. The tests appear to show that people undergo a temporary disintegration of brain networks during a \"trip,\" but re-integration follows soon after. \nPsilocybin has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries and became a popular recreational drug beginning in the psychedelic '60s. The researchers warn that people should not attempt to \"self-medicate,\" as the experimental treatment was conducted in tandem with therapy. They also note the small size of the study group and the absence of a control group as cautions before making applications to the general population. \nHowever, write the study authors, \"accumulating evidence suggests that psilocybin with accompanying psychological support can be used safely to treat a range of psychiatric conditions, including: end-of-life anxiety and depression, alcohol and tobacco addiction, obsessive compulsive disorder, and most recently from our group, treatment-resistant major depression.\" They plan to test psilocybin against a major antidepressant in another trial. Now That's Crazy Despite these positive results, psilocybin use can cause some pretty crazy side effects, like panic attacks, paranoia, strange reactions and outbursts.

You've been eating at Big Al's Cluckin' Chicken Shack for years and it's always earned As. It makes you wonder; what kind of corners is Big Al cutting in the kitchen to get the place demoted to a B, and should you stop eating there? \nRestaurant health inspections are valuable public services paid by your hard-earned tax dollars. But that doesn't mean that the average restaurant-goer has any idea what inspections results are all about. Is the food at a place that earns a B or an 82 percent on its latest inspection really more likely to make you sick than a restaurant that scores an A or a 95 percent? \nKeep Reading Below \nThe short answer: probably not. The main purpose of restaurant inspections is to make sure that local eateries are complying with public health regulations. Those laws are designed to lower the risk of foodborne illnesses by setting rules about employee handwashing, wearing gloves when handling ready-to-eat foods, maintaining minimum internal cooking temperatures for meats, among other standards. \nWhile a restaurant's inspection score is useful shorthand for judging the overall attentiveness of the owner and kitchen staff, it's neither a total condemnation or a guarantee of safety. To be an informed consumer, you really need to know why the restaurant received its rating. Were the violations relatively harmless, like a broken screen on a kitchen window? Or were they objectively scary, like rats crawling through that broken screen? \nTo do that, you need to learn how restaurant inspectors do their job, what constitutes a major or minor violation, and what it takes for the health department to shut a restaurant down. Then you'll be in a better position to decide if Big Al's 16-piece bucket is worth the risk. 1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T02:08:30.892+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4357e17adb0c1c772e2d832957ed0ae5d9c14ba1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpQmnHkozjxpgw7ENdKKT12RghUeUG1g49hICHm0R0BJQki9t4OvkAzzM9UlFoAiHYkPfPkbvvH1r_PVII8cCagDxaKqEbtWkU6yABaHkGEPwJpBaFHhUhvqD1f0WbBYg-", "site_full": "science.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW?type%5b%5d=article&type%5b%5d=list&type%5b%5b=quiz", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "Neanderthal DNA Changed the Way Modern Humans Look", "title_full": "Neanderthal DNA Changed the Way Modern Humans Look", "published": "2017-10-19T00:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/neanderthal-traits-2.jpg", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 478, "comments": 0, "shares": 478}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4357e17adb0c1c772e2d832957ed0ae5d9c14ba1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpQmnHkozjxpgw7ENdKKT12RghUeUG1g49hICHm0R0BJQki9t4OvkAzzM9UlFoAiHYkPfPkbvvH1r_PVII8cCagDxaKqEbtWkU6yABaHkGEPwJpBaFHhUhvqD1f0WbBYg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kate Kershner", "published": "2017-10-19T00:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Neanderthal DNA Changed the Way Modern Humans Look", "text": "Neanderthal DNA Changed the Way Modern Humans Look by Kate Kershner POSTED Oct 18, 2017 When humans interbred with Neanderthals, it affected humans' risk of disease and even physical appearance. martinwimmer/Getty Images \nThe word \"Neanderthal\" is often used as a shorthand for \"idiot.\" But there's now good reason to believe that Neanderthals were just as smart as humans. And on top of that, we're also learning that some traits humans inherited from Neanderthals are apparent in people today. \nResearchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany analyzed the genetic data of 112,338 people of British ancestry who have Neanderthal DNA to conduct a study on the link between Neanderthal DNA and humans' physical characteristics. Having access to a large cohort of study participants from the UK Biobank proved important, since there just isn't much Neanderthal DNA floating around. (People of European and Asian descent get anywhere from 1\u20134 percent of their genes from Neanderthals, thanks to interbreeding thousands of years ago .) \nPrior research has found that the ancient hominids may have influenced a variety of disease-related traits in humans. For instance, the presence of Neanderthal DNA is associated with the increased sensitivity to certain allergens and a higher risk for nicotine addiction . But in the new study, the researchers focused on nondisease phenotypes \u2014 the observable physical characteristics of an organism \u2014 in modern humans. \nWith the help of questionnaires given through UK Biobank, the researchers determined that the propensity to smoke and loneliness are associated with Neanderthal DNA. They also found that some Neanderthal alleles (variant forms of genes) contributed to lighter skin and hair tones in modern humans, while others contributed to darker tones. But breaking down the study's results isn't as easy as pointing to a certain shade of skin and linking it to Neanderthal DNA. Multiple alleles influence skin and hair color, and Neanderthals might've had a large range of skin and hair tones based on different pieces of genetic material, just like modern humans. \nThe researchers noted in the study that many of the Neanderthal-linked traits are related to sunlight exposure , including an allele that contributes to circadian rhythm and the tendency to be an \"evening person.\" In the study, non-African people living farther from the equator had higher frequencies of that allele. Indeed, Neanderthals had been living in northern environments with lower and more varying levels of ultraviolet radiation for thousands of years when modern humans came to the region from sunnier Africa. \nSo, if you stay up late and nap during the day?

JOSE ANTONIO PEAS/Getty Images \nWe're now four films into the multibillion-dollar \"Jurassic Park\" film franchise, and the \"raptors\" are still fan favorites. Audiences revel in watching packs of them gang up on everything from khaki-clad riflemen to a hybridized dino monster. These attacks are organized, strategic and \u2014 in three of the movies, at least \u2014 they rely on a chain of command within the group. \nIs such team-oriented behavior supported by the fossil record? Before we can answer that question though, we should clear something up. Mistaken Identity \nThe dinosaur that's called Velociraptor in the \"Jurassic Park\" movies and novels was based on a completely different animal known as Deinonychus . And when it comes to size, there's a huge gap between the two. Velociraptor wasn't much bigger than a turkey, but the adult Deinonychus measured 11 feet (3.3 meters) long and may have weighed more than 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms). \nBoth are classified as dromaeosaurids, a family of bird-like carnivorous dinos. Members of this group had a specialized toe on each foot, which \u2014 famously \u2014 was held in an upright position while they walked. In theory, that habit kept the large, hook-shaped claws on those digits nice and sharp. (Stay tuned for more details.) \nGetting back to Deinonychus , this particular dinosaur was originally discovered in 1931 in Montana , but it wouldn't be named until 1969. That's when Yale paleontologist John Ostrom was overseeing a dig at a Montana quarry and the bones of four Deinonychus were found strewn around the partial skeleton of a much-larger herbivore called Tenontosaurus . \nLate in his career, Ostrom compared this paleo crime scene to a wolf pack dispatching its prey. The four dead Deinonychus dinos , he theorized, had been killed while attacking the big plant-eater in a coordinated group effort. Later, other members of their pack presumably killed that tenacious Tenontosaurus. A Wolf in Dinosaur's Clothing \nOstrom's work influenced author Michael Crichton, who wrote pack-hunting dromaeosaurs into the first \"Jurassic Park\" book. The concept has since taken hold of the public's imagination. Moreover, it's had a significant impact on dinosaur science. Theropods \u2014 the group containing birds and all known extinct, carnivorous dinos \u2014 are often found buried in close proximity to other members of their own species. Because of this, it's been argued that plenty of non-dromaeosaur predators \u2014 like Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus \u2014 might have hunted in packs, too. \nBut then again, perhaps they didn't. In a 2007 paper , paleontologists Brian Roach and Daniel Brinkman dissected the issue at length. And in their opinion, neither Deinonychus nor Velociraptor nor any other non-avian predatory dinosaur would have formed packs. \"Mammal-like cooperative pack hunting... [is] an extremely rare and complex behavior,\" Daniel Brinkman says via email. \nSo let's talk terminology. Brinkman and Roach's paper defines \"true cooperative pack hunting\" as a group hunting effort carried out by animals that \" habitually work together [with others of their species] to capture and subdue prey too large for an individual predator to kill alone. \" Furthermore, these team-players also defend their territory collectively and may share youngster-rearing duties. \nNo living bird or reptile fits the criteria. It's true that Nile crocodiles sometimes gang up on big mammals like wildebeests, but they later disperse. And although Harris hawks have been known to form hunting parties of up to nine birds, they target small game while doing so. \nThat said, there is one living animal that \u2014 according to Roach and Brinkman \u2014 might offer us some insight into how dromaeosaurs and other non-avian theropods behaved around big prey items: the Komodo dragon . A pack of Velociraptors encircling a lone Protoceratops before they move in for the kill. Mark Stevenson/Stocktrek Images/Getty Images Packs, Tracks and Mobs \nKomodo dragons are solo hunters, and effective ones at that. An adult can bring down victims 10 times its own bodyweight. These reptiles are also eager scavengers, and when one of them kills a large prey item, others are likely to come running. What follows is a gruesome feeding frenzy , with a dozen or more Komodo dragons mobbing the carcass. Such meetings get violent fast. While squabbling over a corpse, Komodos may attack one another; sometimes, they even kill and eat their smaller competitors at the site. \nSo when paleontologists find a large collection of theropod bones and/or teeth in the same fossil deposit, what should they make of it? Should they interpret the remains like a wolf-style family unit? Or should they be viewed as the site of a disorganized mob, where side-squabbles and cannibalism would've been rampant? \nFor their part, Brinkman and Roach find the latter scenario more probable. \" Deinonychus [and other non-avian theropods] were most likely solitary hunters who engaged in antagonistic, Komodo dragon-like feeding aggregations,\" Brinkman says, \"and ... they interacted with each other in ways that were much more contentious, combative and cannibalistic than has widely been believed.\" \nFinding teeth and bones together is one thing, but what about dinosaur footprints? Can they shed any light onto the pack-hunting debate? In 2007, a 120-million-year-old dromaeosaur trackway was discovered in China. Six different sets of parallel tracks \u2014 each made by an animal standing about 4 feet (1.2 meters) tall at the hip \u2014 were found. And judging by the nature of the sediment, it looks like these prints were all laid down within a very short span of time. \nAnthony J. Martin, a leading paleoichnologist (a \" trace fossil scientist\") at Emory University, thinks the animals who made them were traveling in some kind of group. \"The trackways show these dromaeosaurs were moving at about the same pace, in the same direction (parallel), and spaced more-or-less the same distance [apart]. So I'm fairly certain that this is evidence of group behavior,\" he says via email. \nStill, this doesn't necessarily mean the dromaeosaurs hunted in packs. Maybe they were rushing toward a dead body like those independently minded Komodo dragons. In order to confidently cite any footprint assemblage as the product of pack-hunting or a similar activity, we'd need \"more evidence, such as tracks of a prey animal that was clearly preceding them, and not by much time,\" says Martin. \"Best of all would be the dromaeosaur tracks ending at a kill site. An ichnologist can dream, right?\" Now That's Interesting Historically, it was thought that the notorious recurved toe claws of Deinonychus , Velociraptor and their kin were slashing tools, used to disembowel prey. Yet, recent studies have found that the claws would have been better equipped for stabbing or puncturing . Dromaeosaurs therefore might have used their remarkable toes to help them cling onto large, thrashing victims. (Basically, think of this spectacle as a prehistoric rodeo.)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T02:08:34.562+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5940d09462d1dabe2fcb9d3621dc60cbe001cebc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTD75Iij8n2IIq1z1HLygL.OPBFCDiyNLO5p2vxm.QeGihcvVWMkmVnqTfohxCz6WIWciJF10f97sDQfXpi5_ptQkYLuXWbygg-", "site_full": "www.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW?type=video", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "HowStuffWorks Illustrated: Two Legal Gun Modifications", "title_full": "HowStuffWorks Illustrated: Two Legal Gun Modifications", "published": "2017-10-13T18:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://r.hswstatic.com/w_640/h_360/gif/videos/two-legal-gun-modifications.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5940d09462d1dabe2fcb9d3621dc60cbe001cebc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTD75Iij8n2IIq1z1HLygL.OPBFCDiyNLO5p2vxm.QeGihcvVWMkmVnqTfohxCz6WIWciJF10f97sDQfXpi5_ptQkYLuXWbygg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T18:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "HowStuffWorks Illustrated: Two Legal Gun Modifications", "text": "HowStuffWorks Illustrated Two Legal Gun Modifications HowStuffWorks explains two ways that gun owners are modifying their semi-automatic weapons to fire like automatic ones.

Joe Robbins/Getty Images \nLots of teams have unique rallying cries that help their fan bases stand out. For example, New York Jets diehards like to show off their spelling skills by hollering \"J-E-T-S. JETS! JETS! JETS!\" Out west, home crowds at Kansas Jayhawks games intone the school's beloved call to arms, \" Rock, Chalk, Jayhawk! \" Somewhat more biting is the favored mass taunt of Utah State basketball fans. A triumph over the visiting squad\u2014whomever it may be\u2014is followed by the local fans raising their voices together in a brutal, multi-part jeer called \" Winning Team, Losing Team .\" \nOf course, not all chants are team-specific. Consider the famous \"DEE-FENSE\" cheer which rings out at all kinds of American sporting venues, from soccer fields to hockey rinks. That one has an interesting backstory, one that involved a top-notch football roster and a legendary baseball park. \nYankee Stadium (the old one, that is) was the home of the New York Football Giants from 1956 to 1973. Early in their tenure there, the G-Men were an NFL superpower. Under head coach Jim Lee Howell, the franchise built a hard-hitting defense now remembered as one of pro football's all-time best. Included in its ranks were three future Hall of Famers: Sam Huff, Emlen Tunnell, and Andy Robustelli. With so much defensive firepower at hand, it's easy to see why Howell's Giants made six championship game appearances in an eight-year span. \nMuch to the chagrin of Gotham sports fans though, the Giants lost all but the very first of those championship games. In 1956, the team put together a record of eight wins, three losses, and one tie during the regular season. Then, thanks largely to that stellar defense, the team won NFL championship game, in which they clobbered the Chicago Bears, 47-7. (The first Super Bowl wasn't held until 1967.) It would be their last league title for over thirty years, as the Giants did not win a world championship again until they bested John Elway's Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI in 1987. \nThe 1956 New York Giants season is notable for another reason as well. On November 11 of that year, the club hosted the Chicago Cardinals in Yankee Stadium. At the time, these were \u2014 by record \u2014 the two best teams in the NFL's Eastern Conference, so the matchup was highly anticipated . More than 61,000 spectators poured into the stadium, and the G-Men treated them to a 23-10 victory over Chi-Town. Late in the game, as Chicago was driving down the field, the New York fans tried to give their defense some encouragement. \nSuddenly, a few attendees started crying \" Dee-Fense! Dee-Fense! \" And lo, an iconic chant was born. In short order, this became a staple at Giants home games. Fans took to shouting it in unison while the defensive players ran out onto the field before each kickoff. Plus, they'd repeat the statement whenever visiting offenses looked ready to make some trouble. The crowd's passion was deafening; As Giants linebacker Harland Svare once said in retrospect, \"It was almost a distraction. You couldn't hear anything.\" \nGood chants are liable to spread. Eventually, the war cry made its way from the Bronx to Manhattan, transcending sports en route. In 1969, the New York Knicks of the NBA were a championship-caliber, defense-minded team\u2014not unlike Howell's Giants before them. That year, pro basketball fans introduced the \"Dee-Fense\" chant to Madison Square Garden. Here, it was often punctuated by handclaps, resulting in a now-popular upgrade that sounds like this : \"Dee-fense!\" (*Clap! Clap!*) \"DEE-FENSE!\" \nHaving conquered the Big Apple, the intonation began to take root in other cities. It was regularly employed at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium during the 1970s, a decade which saw the Steelers ride their fearsome \"Steel Curtain\" defense to four Super Bowl victories. And after an upset road win over Washington in 1979, the New Orleans Saints were met at the Moissant Airport by 3,000 NOLA fans all screaming \"Dee-Fense!\" over and over. Today, stadium jumbotrons across the country prompt fans into repeating the statement on cue, sometimes with a bit of musical accompaniment from the DJ. \nProps are now involved too. Televised football games almost always include footage of some spectator holding up a cardboard \"D\" in one hand and a picket fence in the other. The true origin of this pun-derful practice is a mystery. But no matter where it came from, the D-Fence sight gag has spawned some cute regional variants. In Seattle, for instance, Seahawks super fan Lorin \"Big Lo\" Sandretzky likes replacing the \"D\" with a cutout of the word \"Sea.\" Get it? \" Sea-Fence! \" Funny stuff. NOW THAT'S INTERESTING Whenever Los Angeles teams play on the road, they can expect to hear the opposing fans chant \" Beat LA! \" Ironically, this tradition started at a game between two east coast franchises. In 1982, the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers met in the NBA's Eastern Conference Finals. The victor would go on to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who'd already won the west. Boston hosted the decisive game seven, in which Philly trounced the Celtics, 120-106. As a show of good sportsmanship, the New England crowd started yelling \"Beat LA! Beat LA!\" And the rest is history.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark mancini", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jim lee howell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "howell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lorin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandretzky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harland svare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emlen tunnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john elway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam huff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy robustelli", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kansas jayhawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york jets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver broncos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston celtics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "celtics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago cardinals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles lakers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seahawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york football giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steelers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new orleans saints", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida state seminoles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york knicks", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "madison square garden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "three rivers stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yankee stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gotham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moissant airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "papa john's cardinal stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bronx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T23:47:15.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8307c6eedc99a3832c60f857e4530ae9e0aa2544", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTtKlG6WTGfxZdqbW3SH7Ny61t004921EixenijIq0La4DzTxb_Kzr4074G.WVy47WeGc0pboFwwd3FufLk1ZEqXizmAWPZ20vj_6eih7t018Z.gWxmhAtIu9o8_o9p3dC4RAjFUSbwqNYSKBkvogD4", "site_full": "auto.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW", "site_categories": ["auto_racing", "car_culture", "vehicles", "auto_repair", "sports"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "California Proposing Ban on Gas and Diesel Cars", "title_full": "California Proposing Ban on Gas and Diesel Cars", "published": "2017-10-19T21:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/california-car-ban.jpg", "performance_score": 7, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 792, "comments": 0, "shares": 792}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8307c6eedc99a3832c60f857e4530ae9e0aa2544", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTtKlG6WTGfxZdqbW3SH7Ny61t004921EixenijIq0La4DzTxb_Kzr4074G.WVy47WeGc0pboFwwd3FufLk1ZEqXizmAWPZ20vj_6eih7t018Z.gWxmhAtIu9o8_o9p3dC4RAjFUSbwqNYSKBkvogD4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cherise Threewitt", "published": "2017-10-19T21:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "California Proposing Ban on Gas and Diesel Cars", "text": "California Proposing Ban on Gas and Diesel Cars by Cherise Threewitt POSTED Oct 19, 2017 The Bay Area Air Quality Management District in San Francisco has set aside $5 million to increase the number of electric car charging stations to 5,000 around the Bay Area. The city currently has 120 charging stations. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \nIn early October 2017, the California announced a potential ban on vehicles powered by internal combustion engines \u2014 in other words those running on gas and diesel. This announcement follows similar ones recently by China, France and the United Kingdom, all designed to shift drivers to electrified vehicles and help reduce pollution . \nThe announcement raises plenty of questions, though, like whether the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will grant a waiver to the California to enforce the proposed law, or if it will have resort to other options , such as changing vehicle registrations or restricting the types of cars that can drive on state highways. \nCalifornia resident and auto industry expert Ed Kim is vice president at AutoPacific , which analyzes the auto industry. He agrees are some of the concerns about the bill that is expected to be announced in January. California's Proposed Law \nThe overall impact on the industry will depend on how the law is written. For example, Kim says the wording of the United Kingdom rule states only that by 2040, all new vehicles must be electrified , which includes hybrids, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen. This is much different than mandating fully electric vehicles. \n\"In other words, there will be plenty of new vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel in the U.K. in 2040, it's just that they will be augmented by batteries,\" Kim says via email. \"We have not seen the wording of the proposed bill that will be introduced in California in January, but if it follows the lead of other so-called gasoline bans announced around the world, it will likely stipulate that all new vehicles sold in California by 2040 must [have] some form of electrification.\" \nThat said, the rule-makers could still go more extreme. Hybrids and EVs cost more than conventional gasoline cars because the high-tech batteries are expensive. Federal and state tax rebates help offset the cost somewhat (this is true across the country) but it's understandable that Californians might be concerned about buying the higher-priced cars. It's still premature to worry, Kim says, though by the time the rule is enforced, batteries should be much more affordable than they are now. \n\"By some estimates, battery powered cars will be cheaper than conventional cars in the foreseeable future,\" he says. \nSupport is another problem, though. California's EV infrastructure is among the best in the country, but even it needs improvement. According to Wired , the city of San Jose has 500 electric charge points per million people, and San Francisco has 450 charge points per million people. These numbers are high, but Silicon Valley and major cities don't represent the entire state. Driving electric cars has to be just as convenient for people in areas that are less densely populated. California is already working on it, and was just awarded $800 million to allocate toward infrastructure as part of Volkswagen's Dieselgate settlement . \nThe state's electric grid already produces enough energy to support more electric cars, but Kim points out it might be difficult to get homes ready. Multi-family dwellings like apartments and condos can only support so many charging outlets, especially where so many residents depend on street parking. There is also concern that some buildings are too old to safely handle an increase in electrical load. \nEven with plenty of power to go around, consumers need to understand what they're paying for. Kim says that the complicated pricing structure of utilities is already too confusing. \"Figuring out one's operating costs for an electrified vehicle is so much more complex than filling up a tank with gasoline or diesel,\" he says. \"This needs to change in order for the mainstream to adopt electrification.\" The Auto Industry Response \nAs mentioned earlier, California already affects automakers' development and engineering, although if this new measure passes, the result will be on a much larger scale. Automakers are, understandably, anxious to see the verbiage of California's proposed rule and how much it differs from federal law. \n\"Automakers have traditionally been annoyed by California's more stringent standards because they sometimes have to develop powertrains to two different standards: California and the rest of the country,\" Kim says. \"A California mandate that all vehicles must be electrified can further complicate things.\" \nIn other words, stricter rules will force automakers to make more electric cars to meet the demand in California, but since building cars just for California is unrealistic, it will affect the make-up of their entire fleets. This concern might be overblown, though, since the shift is already happening. Since China's announcement , General Motors disclosed a plan for 20 new EV models by 2023, and BMW and Volvo have both announced a shift toward EV-focused lineups. \nAnything that forces changes on the automotive industry affects the rest of the United States, but that might not be as drastic as it sounds. There's reason to believe the auto industry would go in this direction anyway, Kim says, and California is a good test case. The state's progress in developing a reliable charging infrastructure will make it easier for other states to adopt. \n\"The market might well reach 100 percent electrification by then anyway, given the dropping costs of batteries and a big influx of hybrids coming soon,\" Kim says. \"If we are talking all-electric, then it will be a huge challenge, but a valuable one in the sense that if such a huge state and one of the world's biggest economies can transition to all-electric, well, it probably can be done anywhere.\" Now That's Interesting California was one of the first U.S. states to build out infrastructure to support EVs, so auto manufacturers have used the state to test electric and electric hybrid vehicles for some time.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cherise threewitt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ed kim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "air quality management district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "volkswagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general motors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "volvo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "autopacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environmental protection agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmw", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bay area", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san jose", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T23:47:16.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6d117eff55d5c6c5a0d52e552451136cd26eb14a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpQmnHkozjxpgw7ENdKKT12RghUeUG1g704tbvauZP8MqBsMP8NDM_Gcf.BSxIBVt1HwDKiV8sHOOxxTMNiy_FQ5bMuqRGqEC2j0TJCJJ2j7yLjUpZLgiQ_SQSvj2MMC9fnE3qa4TtPg--", "site_full": "science.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "How Long Can a Person Safely Hang Upside Down?", "title_full": "How Long Can a Person Safely Hang Upside Down?", "published": "2017-10-19T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/hangupsidedown-1.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 131, "comments": 1, "shares": 131}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6d117eff55d5c6c5a0d52e552451136cd26eb14a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpQmnHkozjxpgw7ENdKKT12RghUeUG1g704tbvauZP8MqBsMP8NDM_Gcf.BSxIBVt1HwDKiV8sHOOxxTMNiy_FQ5bMuqRGqEC2j0TJCJJ2j7yLjUpZLgiQ_SQSvj2MMC9fnE3qa4TtPg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jesslyn Shields", "published": "2017-10-19T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Long Can a Person Safely Hang Upside Down?", "text": "How Long Can a Person Safely Hang Upside Down? by Jesslyn Shields POSTED Oct 19, 2017 How much time can the human body spend upside down? Hans Neleman/Getty Images \nDoes hanging upside down make you feel a little panicky? Like it might explode your head? Like all your spit might pool in your nose and drown you? Or like your eyes might pop out of their sockets and plop on the floor? \nDon't worry \u2014 none of those things would happen. But hanging out in a head-down position isn't completely harmless, either. In fact, being suspended upside down for too long might not eject your eyeballs (although it can occasionally lead to temporary loss of vision in some people), but it would eventually kill you . \nIn 2009, a Utah man named John Jones died after spending 28 hours stuck upside down in a cave. Rescue workers tried to work fast, but the walls of the passage were so narrow, they weren't able to get him out before he died \u2014 most likely of asphyxiation. Turns out, your lungs evolved to sit atop of all the other organs for a reason. Delicate organs that they are, it doesn't take them long to get squished by the bigger, heavier organs like the liver and intestines that usually sit below them. This isn't as much of a problem when you're lying on an incline with your feet slightly elevated above your head, but when your head is directly underneath your feet, your lungs simply can't absorb enough oxygen given the available space they have to work with. Natalie Morales (L) and Savannah Guthrie appear on NBC's \"Today Show\" testing an inversion table, which suspends a user upside down for a brief period of time. Peter Kramer/NBC/NBC NewsWire/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty Images \nBut it's not just the lungs you have to worry about during extended periods of reverse suspension. Our bodies are well set up to move blood around when we're standing upright, and our blood vessels are customized to make sure blood doesn't pool up in our feet. But that system is a one-way street \u2014 our bodies didn't evolve to keep blood from pooling in the brain. When this happens, all sort of things could go wrong, including ruptured blood vessels, which can lead to brain hemorrhage. \nAnd don't forget about your heart ! Medical professionals think heart failure is the cause of death in most upside-down fatalities , for much the same reason our brains can suffer: when you're head down, your heart slows down its pumping and starts receiving more blood than it has the capacity to manage at one time. It begins to have a hard time maintaining blood pressure, and eventually loses its ability to move enough blood around to maintain all the body's essential functions. \nBut here's the thing: Although hanging upside down will occasionally kill people , if you take it in shorter stints, it can confer some pretty compelling health benefits. Inverted poses encourage blood to flow from the feet, legs and pelvis back to the heart and lungs, where it picks up fresh oxygen. Studies have shown that, over time, brief inversions can lower the resting heart rate, increase overall endurance and help your body use oxygen more efficiently during exercise. \n\"In yoga, inversions are considered beneficial in a number of ways; headstand and shoulderstand are among the most important of all the asanas, cleansing the lymphatic system and stimulating all of the systems in general,\" says Julie Phillips, an aerial yoga and dance instructor at Canopy Studio in Athens, Georgia. \"Yogis are known to hold inversions for long periods of time \u2014 12 minutes, and I've even read there are some who hold them for hours. On the personal level, while I don't hold inversions anywhere near that long, I find them to be very therapeutic.\" \nSo although inverse suspension can be dangerous, it's actually pretty rare that people die from it. There doesn't even seem to be a hard-and-fast rule about how long it's safe to hang out upside down. For instance, people with heart conditions die a lot faster in situations like these, and young, healthy people can survive longer than the old or sick. Afraid of getting stuck upside down on a roller coaster ? Well, it's not impossible. In 1997, a group of people found themselves in exactly that position for an hour and a half, and everyone survived the ordeal. \nSo the rule of thumb seems to be, if you're upside down and start to feel like you should stop, then stop. \n\"In my aerial yoga classes, we take five minutes \u2014 sometimes longer \u2014 with students hanging upside down,\" says Phillips, \"but I make it clear they can come into and out of their inversion throughout that time, and emphasize they should come out at any point that it feels like too much.\" Illusionist David Blaine hangs upside down in New York's Trump Tower to announce a Sept. 18, 2008, endurance challenge where he spent most of 60 hours suspended upside down.

NASA, ESA, and A. Feild (STScI) \nWhen a massive star runs out of fuel and dies, it may go out in a blaze of glory, exploding as a supernova . \nBut supernovas aren't the only big booms out there. Enter the \"kilonova.\" It's 1,000 times brighter than a nova (when a white dwarf erupts) but not as bright as a supernova . A kilonova is triggered by the collision of two stellar corpses. These events produce the most powerful electromagnetic explosions in the universe and are responsible for showering the universe in gold . Stellar Husks \nNeutron stars are the stellar corpses in question. Produced by supernovas, these extremely dense husks are left behind after massive stars end their lives. They are composed mainly of neutrons and measure about a dozen miles wide. But don't let their relatively diminutive size fool you. They pack the mass of an entire star (more massive than our sun) into their tiny volumes and possess intense magnetic fields. This means neutron stars are among the most extreme objects in the known universe. A teaspoonful of neutron star material weighs a cool 1 billion tons (907 million metric tons). \nNeutron star matter doesn't act like normal matter. These gravitationally dominated objects crush all that they are made of into a \"degenerate\" state. That is, the pressures are so extreme that quantum mechanics is the only thing preventing their mass from collapsing in on itself and creating a black hole. \nSo, if two neutron stars collided, it would obviously be an incredibly violent and destructive event. On Aug. 17, scientists saw the aftermath of such a collision courtesy of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO) in the U.S. and the Virgo gravitational wave observatory in Italy. These advanced gravitational wave observatories detected a very strange, weak signal emanating from a galaxy called NGC 4993, 130 million light-years away. Multi-messenger Astronomy \nUntil that moment, gravitational wave detectors had only discerned the merger of black holes billions of light-years away, so to measure a weak signal at a comparatively close distance came as a surprise. After analysis of the telltale gravitational wave \"chirp\" (a rapid increase in frequency as two massive objects spin around each other, eventually colliding and merging), scientists realized that the signal, called GW170817, wasn't a black hole merger, it was in fact the merger of two neutron stars. The stars, with masses of only 1.1 and 1.6 suns, had become trapped in a gravitational dance, spiraling in on one another and colliding. \nWhen the detection was made, NASA's Fermi gamma-ray observatory and Europe's INTEGRAL space telescope also recorded a powerful flash of gamma-ray radiation blasting from NGC 4993, known as a short gamma-ray burst (GRB). \nAlthough scientists have theorized that short GRBs are generated by colliding neutron stars, only with the help of gravitational wave detectors could this be confirmed. This is the first time that scientists have measured both the gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves from a single cosmic event, connecting a GRB with a neutron star merger and opening a brand-new way to study the universe \u2013 known as \" multi-messenger astronomy .\" Kilonova! \nThe gravitational waves helped us connect the GRB with the collision of neutron stars, but what created the GRB? \nThe neutron star merger that generated GW170817 was undoubtedly a violent one. As the two masses rapidly spun around each other and made contact, huge quantities of super-hot neutron star material were blasted into space. When this happened, it set the stage for some kilonova fireworks. \nAs neutron stars are composed mainly of neutrons, and neutrons are a key component (along with protons) of atomic nuclei, there were suddenly a LOT of subatomic building blocks flying around immediately after the neutron star smashup. The conditions were so extreme that this environment was ripe for chunks of radioactive neutron star material to stick together, creating new elements. Through a process called rapid neutron capture (\"r-process\"), neutrons attached themselves to the newly minted elements before they could radioactively decay. The creation of new elements generated an astounding amount of energy, erupting with powerful gamma-ray radiation, generating the GRB astronomers saw from 130 million light-years away. \nFollow-up studies of the turbulent blast site by the Hubble Space Telescope, Gemini Observatory and ESO Very Large Telescope revealed spectroscopic evidence for the r-process having taken place. And this is special: In the remnants of the kilonova blast, vast quantities of heavy elements , like gold, platinum, lead, uranium and silver had been synthesized. \nScientists have long wondered how elements heavier than iron are created in our universe (elements lighter than iron are created via stellar nucleosynthesis in the cores of stars), but now we have observational evidence that these cataclysmic kilonovas are also cosmic foundries where the heaviest \u2014 and most precious \u2014 elements are seeded. \nEditorial note: This article was corrected on Oct. 20, to rectify an inaccuracy introduced by the editor, misstating the brightness of kilonovas. Supernovas are, in fact, the brightest, followed by kilonovas and novas, respectively. Now That's Interesting Although gravitational waves travel at the speed of light, GW170817 was detected by LIGO and Virgo moments before the GRB was detected by Fermi and INTEGRAL. According to NASA , this is because the neutron star merger happened first (launching gravitational waves) and the kilonova erupted moments after (blasting the universe with gamma rays).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T03:12:57.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e61619c4543bf7622227280c737fa6dd18c183cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpQmnHkozjxpgw7ENdKKT12RghUeUG1g6ZPrq6zY9G3eAuvKbvTNULtHFjoWkh34GGCUtB2FIOyE0k9HFrTaFS5WaXiH54gvk-", "site_full": "science.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/science", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "Science | HowStuffWorks", "title": "Haumea, a Dwarf Planet in the Kuiper Belt, Has Its Own Ring", "title_full": "Haumea, a Dwarf Planet in the Kuiper Belt, Has Its Own Ring", "published": "2017-10-20T17:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/haumea-ring-iaa.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 383, "comments": 0, "shares": 383}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e61619c4543bf7622227280c737fa6dd18c183cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpQmnHkozjxpgw7ENdKKT12RghUeUG1g6ZPrq6zY9G3eAuvKbvTNULtHFjoWkh34GGCUtB2FIOyE0k9HFrTaFS5WaXiH54gvk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jesslyn Shields", "published": "2017-10-20T17:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Haumea, a Dwarf Planet in the Kuiper Belt, Has Its Own Ring", "text": "Haumea, a Dwarf Planet in the Kuiper Belt, Has Its Own Ring by Jesslyn Shields POSTED Oct 20, 2017 Scientists have identified a ring circling Haumea, an egg-shaped dwarf planet (relatively) near Pluto shown in this artist's illustration. JM Madiedo, JL Ortiz/IAA-CSIC \nThere's a lot going on just outside of our solar system , planet-wise. Sure, there's the dwarf planet Pluto lurking out there beyond Neptune. But there's more than that one, demoted little former planet hanging out in the Kuiper Belt, the disc of space rubble that orbits our sun. In fact, in addition to an unfathomable number of asteroids and chunks of frozen gasses, Pluto has a couple of dwarf planet friends out there in the Kuiper belt called Haumea and Makemake. There may, of course, be more mini worlds out there, but for now it's great to find out what we can about the ones we know. \nWhich is why astronomers are pumped about discovering a ring around Haumea. \nPlanets, as we know, sometimes have rings made out of chunks of rock and ice \u2014 Saturn's got the most famous one , but Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune have them, too. But Haumea, a little oblong chunk of rock that lies 50 times farther away from the sun than Earth, is the only official dwarf planet ringed by its own collection of orbiting space particles. It's also the only trans-Neptunian object \u2014 a planet-like object that orbits the sun from a distance equal or greater to that of the planet Neptune \u2014 known to have a ring. \nA new study published in the October 2017 journal Nature reports the discovery of Haumea's ring. In January, 2017, a team of researchers from the Spain's Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia (IAA-CSIC) wanting to find out more about the celestial body trained 12 telescopes from 10 different European observatories at a star they knew Haumea would pass in front of. When the dwarf planet moved in front of the star, they expected to be able to get a good look at Haumea's size, shape and rotational speed, which they did, but they also spotted a ring. \n\"There are different possible explanations for the formation of the ring,\" said lead author Jos\u00e9 Luis Ortiz, a researcher at the IAA-CSIC, in a press release . \"It may have originated in a collision with another object, or in the dispersal of surface material due to the planet's high rotational speed.\" \nThe scientists also found Haumea to be much bigger, less dense and less reflective than they suspected. The egg-shaped Haumea, when measured along its largest axis, is about as long as Pluto is round, and has at least two of its own moons: Hi\u02bbiaka and N\u0101maka.

And the researchers think that presence of a ring, which circles Haumea about 1,421 miles (2,287 kilometers) from its equator at a speed three times slower than the planet's own rotation, might mean similar rings could be much more common in our solar system than previously thought.

New research suggests the last common ancestor of all apes may have been about the size of a modern-day gibbon. Louise LeGresley/Getty Images \nWe want to understand where we come from, but all we humans know for scientific fact is that we are primates like apes, monkeys and lemurs, and that our ancestor species inched their way over millions of years along some labyrinthine evolutionary trail that is now largely obscured by time. We may never know every hairpin turn of that path, but that doesn't keep us from trying. \nSo we chip away at the available evidence to find out as much as possible about our hominid and hominin ancestors, from diet to movement to social organization to ecological niche. And one thing that affects these, and scores of other elements of an animal's ecology and biology, is body mass. A new study published in the journal Nature Communications suggests that the last common ancestor (LCA) between all modern apes \u2014 including humans and great apes like chimpanzees \u2014 was an animal no bigger than a modern-day gibbon . This chart shows the current scientific understanding of ape and human lineage. University of T\u00fcbingen \n\"Body size directly affects how an animal relates to its environment, and no trait has a wider range of biological implications,\" said lead author Mark Grabowski, who conducted the work as a postdoctoral fellow in the American Museum of Natural History's Division of Anthropology , in a press release . \"However, little is known about the size of the last common ancestor of humans and all living apes. This omission is startling because numerous paleobiological hypotheses depend on body size estimates at and prior to the root of our lineage.\" \nNobody's sure exactly when this split between the hominid ancestors happened, but it was probably during the Miocene, between 23 million and 5 million years ago. The fervent pipe dream of every paleobiologist is that we will one day find fossil evidence of the LCA, or the fabled \" Missing Link ,\" that will explain everything about how we got to be this way. \nBut in order to estimate the body mass of the LCA without the holy grail of fossils, these researchers used the stats of modern apes and the fossils we do have from Miocene primate species from Africa, Europe and Asia to piece together a rough courtroom sketch of the animal. They came to the conclusion that the LCA probably weighed around 12 pounds (5.4 kilograms). \nConsidering researchers have most recently worked under the assumption that the LCA probably weighed around the same as a modern chimpanzee \u2014 100 pounds (45 kilograms) \u2014 this study could vastly change the way we think of the evolutionary history of our species. For instance, the LCA might not have just climbed trees as modern chimpanzees do, they could have swung from trees with the overhand motion of a modern gibbon, which would have helped provide access to hard-to-get food. The predilection toward bigger bodies might have evolved later, then, to help our ape ancestors contend with a growing number of monkey competitors. \n\"There appears to be a decrease in overall body size within our lineage, rather than size simply staying the same or getting bigger with time, which goes against how we generally think about evolution,\" Grabowski said.   The study also concluded that many of our early human relatives, from Australopithecus to Homo erectus , were probably smaller than their ancestors.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T22:23:02.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a96bec17a7f74a3aec128c6bdbec9e2f39d239e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpQmnHkozjxpgw7ENdKKT12RghUeUG1g704tbvauZP8MqBsMP8NDM_Gcf.BSxIBVuKg384RGwWYDWHhsXJC1j5czpaBjTt_YlLZlqmtp4Uk1RH0vJpguhqsS5okGCITpm4ODkWoDtWrS5Loz5q3mnQ3InPrNe.LCOZeqcrlmkhU_MOuqdPEEY5", "site_full": "science.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/science", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "Science | HowStuffWorks", "title": "Silly, Serious and Surprising: Our Best Stories You Might Have Missed This Week", "title_full": "Silly, Serious and Surprising: Our Best Stories You Might Have Missed This Week", "published": "2017-10-21T00:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/wrap-up-10-20.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 33, "comments": 0, "shares": 33}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a96bec17a7f74a3aec128c6bdbec9e2f39d239e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTpQmnHkozjxpgw7ENdKKT12RghUeUG1g704tbvauZP8MqBsMP8NDM_Gcf.BSxIBVuKg384RGwWYDWHhsXJC1j5czpaBjTt_YlLZlqmtp4Uk1RH0vJpguhqsS5okGCITpm4ODkWoDtWrS5Loz5q3mnQ3InPrNe.LCOZeqcrlmkhU_MOuqdPEEY5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Yves Jeffcoat", "published": "2017-10-21T00:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Silly, Serious and Surprising: Our Best Stories You Might Have Missed This Week", "text": "Silly, Serious and Surprising: Our Best Stories You Might Have Missed This Week by Yves Jeffcoat POSTED Oct 20, 2017 The hippo pictured here, Orion, is the child of one of the hippos drug kingpin Pablo Escobar previously owned.

Macduff Everton/Getty Images \nWhen Cornelia Bailey was a child on Sapelo Island, Georgia, her dog Spot got sick \u2014 his hind legs stopped working and all he could do was drag himself around on his front legs. Her parents told her to bury the dog in the dirt, just leaving his head out. She and her brother put a little shelter over his head and gave him water but otherwise left him alone. \n\"After three days, we dug Spot up, and low and behold, he could walk ... In a couple of hours' time, he was charging around the yard like he'd never been sick,\" she recalled in her memoir \" God, Dr. Buzzard and the Bolito Man .\" \nBailey, who died on Oct. 13, 2017 at age 72, was the unofficial historian and community leader of Sapelo Island, one of the barrier islands (called the Sea Islands) off the coast of Georgia. Even today, there is no bridge to the mainland \u2014 all visitors come by ferry. The island is known for its Hog Hammock community \u2014 virtually all its residents are direct descendants of slaves who were brought to the island in the late 1700s and worked the land when it was owned by a white planter named Thomas Spalding. (The former \"big house\" is now called Reynolds Mansion , since it was later owned by tobacco magnate R.J. Reynolds Jr.) The Reynolds Mansion on Sapelo Island, Georgia is open for group rentals. Marjie Lambert/Miami Herald/MCT via Getty Images \nBecause of its relative isolation from the mainland, Sapelo Island residents were able to keep many of their African customs and folklore alive. Bailey's great-great-great grandfather, Bilali Muhammad, was a Muslim, and the plantation's manager, although he was enslaved. Even after his descendants converted to Christianity, they continued observing customs that were rooted in Islam. For instance, the men and women sat separately in church and the congregation faced the East when it prayed. Geechee Culture \nThe Sea Islands are home to the Geechee-Gullah people, the terms given to the African-American descendants who live on the various islands off the coast of Georgia and South Carolina. \"Gullah\" is the term most often used in South Carolina, while Georgians tend to use the term \"Geechee.\" In an interview earlier this year, Bailey joked that some Gullah people had a distinctive accent and \"some of them practice it real hard for the tourists' sake. Sneak up on them when there's no tourist around ... they drop [it]. There's no pretension here. What you see is what you get.\" \nAfter slavery ended, people on Sapelo started buying the plots of land they lived on. At one time, there were five small black communities on the island. Today, there is just one, Hog Hammock. A sign that was erected in the early 1990s set the population at 70. But Bailey said it is now more like 48, including just nine children. The island school closed in the 1970s. There is just one grocery store, and the only two churches that hold services on alternate Sundays. St. Luke Baptist Church is one of the two functioning churches on Sapelo Island. Services are held twice a month. Kathryn Whitbourne \n\"We've had some people move back. But we want people to move back who've got children,\" Bailey said. \"Some people say, 'Soon as I retire I'm coming home.' You're not coming home at age 65 dragging two or three little kids with you. That's what you need to keep a community going. Without children you don't have a community.\" Survival \nThe slow decline in population is understandable, as there are few jobs on the island. Most of it is owned by the State of Georgia and a large part is designated a marine preserve. The people who are employed on the island either work at the Reynolds Mansion or for the University of Georgia's Marine Institute; the rest work on the mainland. A business growing heirloom red peas and other crops for cash has been started. Bailey had been working to establish a living history village on-site. \nBailey, who became interested in preserving the Sapelo Island culture by \"being nosy\" said she hoped the next generations appreciated and built on the work she had done. \"Why the heck else are we paying these high taxes, if not for them? I tell my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren, 'I'm not paying these things and fighting for myself because these days I've got one foot on a banana peel.' So, you gotta take care of your legacy.\" The beach at Sapelo Island. Kathryn Whitbourne \nWhether Hog Hammock will survive is an open question. \"If we look at other seaside and coastal historically black coastal communities \u2014 places like Hilton Head \u2014 the prospects are grim,\" says Melissa Cooper, an associate professor of history at Rutgers University and the author of \" Making Gullah: A History of Sapelo Islanders, Race, and the American Imagination .\" However, the islanders are really fighting hard to ensure that their descendants can still call the island home ... That said, all the indicators say that something major will have to be done to make the retention of the people who live in the community now and the reintroduction of descendants feasible. And I'm not sure what that would look like and I'm not sure that would happen.\" \nCooper has relatives from Sapelo and remembers visiting as a child in the summers. \"[Back then], the island was populated by a greater number of black people, more children on the island, more elderly. The senior citizen building was a functioning center, the island had more vitality. So not only are my visits [now] accented by the fact that these people are not there, but they are also accented by the fact that there are all these new structures on stilts everywhere that also represent the influx of new people who are taking residence on the island even if it's just weekenders or vacationers.\" \nCooper brings up another important issue in the survival of Sapelo: property taxes. Outsiders have been building vacation homes on the island, and driving up property taxes. (Some Hog Hammock residents have filed a federal lawsuit alleging discrimination and violation of fair housing laws.) But these vacation homes are also attracting more visitors to the island. \n\"It's up to the islanders to determine whether it's a good thing or not,\" Cooper says. \"If other coastal communities are any indication of what is to come, a change in the economic profile of the community will also mirror changes in the tax structure, the value of property and I wonder if you can have a sort of mixed use community with different economic profiles unless it is done intentionally.\" Now That's Cool More information on visiting Sapelo Island can be found at the Sapelo Island Visitors Center .

Dove POSTED Oct 23, 2017 A new Porsche 718 Boxster model is on display at the 2016 Geneva International Motor Show. The Boxster is one of the models included in the new Porsche Passport subscription program. Chesnot/Getty Images \nIf you're in the mood for a new car and feeling kinda extra, now you can use an app to book a luxury sports car or SUV and have it delivered on demand. \nIn November 2017, Porsche will roll out a subscription-based mobile app called Porsche Passport . The pilot program, launching initially only in Atlanta, allows users to book one of eight different Porsche models that, for a mere $2,000 a month, will be delivered right to their driveways. For $3,000 a month, users get on-demand access to even more cars \u2014 22 model variants! \u2014 that can be supplied anywhere in metropolitan Atlanta. \n\"All this goes back to us looking into society trends and us saying, well there is actually a target group out there, who's not so much interested in owning a car, but using a car,\" Klaus Zellmer, president and CEO of Porsche North America, told WABE Atlanta . \"This target group, from our perspective, also is interested in not using just one car of our range, they want to use many cars. Not at the same time, but they want the flexibility to change over.\" \nIn addition to exchanging vehicles frequently using the month-to-month program, users don't have to worry about the extra miles they put in while showing off their new wheels. That's because mileage is unlimited. Vehicle tax, registration, insurance, roadside assistance, maintenance and detailing are included, too. All it takes is an app download , a $500 set-up fee, and a successful background check. Oh, and a commitment of thousands of dollars a month, too. \nWhile Porsche is hoping to tap into user trends and plans to discontinue the test subscription program if it hurts sales, it isn't the only luxury brand taking the leap. In 2017, Cadillac also launched a subscription service for residents in the New York metropolitan area \u2014 that app-based service costs $1,500 a month. \nAnd, for those who don't want to decide on just one brand, consider Revolve , a subscription service that costs $2,000 a month for access to a fleet including cars from Jaguar, Tesla, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Land Rover, Cadillac, Maserati and, yes, Porsche. Revolve's is a longer commitment, ranging from one to four months, and currently serves only the South Florida area. Now That's Interesting Subscriptions are big business : More than 2,000 different \"subscription box\" services exist in the U.S. alone, ranging from women's clothing and men's razors to dog treats and toys.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laurie l. dove", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "klaus zellmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maserati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tesla", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "porsche", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "audi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaguar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes-benz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wabe atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "porsche north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cadillac", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-23T20:29:27.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9f83eb0bf48862b86cc61dead160b72d7578b71", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT2j7n6D6CkqM9zofU2sCAybOkSLSxxvZ7I1YGWCxm00nBRqNLk4dMIYcDdew086U3xQ2S3I7kfHp_yhJyx.Vj2jhXCgrmDijOZ5G7GJ0SPKTpHngGnThdLdT1_MoUqUWvprk9SE.nwqA--", "site_full": "lifestyle.howstuffworks.com", "site": "howstuffworks.com", "site_section": "http://syndication.howstuffworks.com/rss/HSW", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!", "title": "Going Micro: Tiny Weddings on the Rise", "title_full": "Going Micro: Tiny Weddings on the Rise", "published": "2017-10-23T22:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://r.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/microwedding-1.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 1670, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 525, "comments": 0, "shares": 525}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9f83eb0bf48862b86cc61dead160b72d7578b71", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT2j7n6D6CkqM9zofU2sCAybOkSLSxxvZ7I1YGWCxm00nBRqNLk4dMIYcDdew086U3xQ2S3I7kfHp_yhJyx.Vj2jhXCgrmDijOZ5G7GJ0SPKTpHngGnThdLdT1_MoUqUWvprk9SE.nwqA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alia Hoyt", "published": "2017-10-23T22:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Going Micro: Tiny Weddings on the Rise", "text": "Going Micro: Tiny Weddings on the Rise by Alia Hoyt POSTED Oct 23, 2017 Weddings have been getting a lot smaller these days but not only to save on money. Kristine Foley/Getty Images \nBack in May, digital marketing specialist Katie Biggs married her husband in New York City. Their ceremony was held at City Hall, followed by vegan dim sum in Chinatown. The event was capped off with a champagne toast at their apartment that evening. From start to finish, their wedding day was attended by a total of 25 people, only family and very close friends. \n\"Having a huge wedding was not what either of us wanted. We don't have the type of personalities for putting on a show, so we kept it to our nearest and dearest in one of our favorite restaurants,\" she explains in an email. \"Our wedding was also more budget-friendly; we saved money on having a huge ceremony which meant that we could spend more on the elements that did mean a lot to us -- I got to spend more on flowers, he got to spend more on his suit.\" \nBiggs is part of a growing trend: the microwedding. Lavish nuptials have long been the standard, at least for people who could afford the significant expense. But, many couples are now opting instead for a more intimate experience \u2014 sometimes to save money, other times to make the wedding experience more meaningful. The Knot notes in its 2016 survey that the average number of wedding guests is now 141, down from 149 in 2009. \n\"I think couples are going this route because they want to make their wedding experience personal to their relationship and not worry about all the traditions of a wedding that they don't want,\" says microwedding and elopement coordinator Tracy Brisson with Savannah Custom Weddings & Elopements . So far for 2017, she says 107 couples have chosen microwedding packages \u2014 about a third of all the company's weddings. In 2016, 88 couples chose microwedding packages, or 23 percent. What a Microwedding Isn't \nSo what exactly is a microwedding? First off, it's not an elopement, because it's not a secret. There's usually some planning involved, but far less than for a traditional wedding. There's also no definitive number of guests. Some wedding planners put it at less than 50, others at less than 10 guests. \"[It's] the fewest you can get away with having,\" explains global trends expert Daniel Levine in an email. \"They are the result of a conscious decision to exclude guests who you would have invited to a 'regular' wedding ... The microwedding trend is rising, and will continue to grow over the next decade.\" https://www.instagram.com/p/BJkn6UHhZSQ/ \nThere's also often an absence of tradition, which differentiates microweddings from a typical small wedding of the past. So, there might not be a church, a decorated hall or a reception area with lots of fresh flowers. \"Most people buy a ton of flowers, hire a wedding planner and a popular band because it's tradition. They assume it's expected,\" says Shelley Grieshop, writer with Totally Promotional , a company that makes wedding favors and other items. \nHowever, microweddings aren't necessarily about being understated or thrifty. Sometimes, couples go all out for a smaller number of guests. \"I find that couples like to take advantage of the money saved to create a wedding weekend for their guests. The majority of my clients are planning destination weddings, so they use the savings to extend the festivities and keep family and friends entertained throughout their stay,\" emails Emily Sullivan of Intimate Weddings by Emily Sullivan , which focuses on nuptials with a lower guest count. \"We're seeing everything from crawfish boil welcome parties to brunch at five-star restaurants.\" Boomers and Millennials \nSo, who is most likely to take advantage of this trend? Southwest Florida wedding planner Jenifer Gay, with Blue Flamingo Weddings , says her most common microwedding couple is an older pair who were previously married. \"They have no interest in spending their hard-earned money on a big wedding, nor do they feel the need to impress anyone,\" she says by email. \nMillennials are also big into this trend. Since they're marrying at older ages than previous generations, they're often paying for all or most of the wedding themselves, notes Flora Ellis with Unveil Events . \"Because of this, couples really care about value and the experience of their wedding day,\" she emails. \nJust don't be surprised if some people get their noses out of joint when they don't make the guest list. There are bound to be hurt feelings, so Emily Sullivan recommends that couples head it off at the pass by being vocal about their plans. \"I suggest to my clients that they need to set expectations with family and friends ahead of time. This can be a tough but necessary conversation.\" \nAs for who to invite to your microwedding, Sullivan says to think of it this way: \"If you were going to have a dinner party at your house, who would you invite? Those are the people that need to be with you on your wedding day,\" she says. Now That's Crazy Many New Yorkers are going micro \u2014 and no wonder.

Kristina Jackson/Getty Images \nMy little beagle Daisy gets away with just about anything thanks to her big brown eyes. It's almost like she knows if she flashes me those puppy dog eyes, she's got me wrapped around her, well, fluffy dog tail. \nAnd according to new research from the University of Portsmouth's Dog Cognition Centre , dogs like Daisy deliberately make more facial expressions when we're watching them, and it could be their way to communicate with us. The study was led by Dr. Juliane Kaminski and published in the October 2017 issue of Scientific Reports . \nKaminski and her research team came to their conclusion after watching 24 different dogs, all family pets of varying breeds and ages. Each dog was filmed individually in a room with a person who went through various scenarios, including looking at the dog, looking away from the dog and giving the dog food. \nThe scientists then studied the dogs' facial expressions using the Dog Facial Action Coding System (DogFACS), which is a scientific tool for coding canines' facial movements. (It was adapted from the FACS system created for humans by Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen in 1978.) Kaminski and her team discovered that each dog made animated faces when the person in the room was looking at it, including raising its eyebrows and sticking out its tongue \u00e2\u0080\u0094 much more than when the person's back was turned. \n\"The findings appear to support evidence [that] dogs are sensitive to humans' attention and that expressions are potentially active attempts to communicate, not simple emotional displays,\" Dr. Juliane Kaminski says in a press statement . \nMost surprisingly is that even the presence of food didn't influence the dogs as much as human affection. \"We knew domestic dogs paid attention to how attentive a human is \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in a previous study we found, for example, that dogs stole food more often when the human's eyes were closed or they had their back turned,\" Kaminski says. \"In another study, we found dogs follow the gaze of a human if the human first establishes eye contact with the dog, so the dog knows the gaze-shift is directed at them.\" \nKaminski says it's possible that the expressions of dogs have changed as they've become more domesticated . But the study does have its limits: Twenty-four canines makes for a small study sample, so it's likely that more dogs should be studied to confirm the findings. \nOf course, we may never know, regardless of how many scientists study it, if our dogs truly understand what we say or if they're really trying to communicate with us through their eyes or faces. But I'm pretty sure my beagle friend knows exactly what she's doing when she flashes her big brown eyes my way.

Les Stocker/Oxford Scientific/Getty Images \nSeasonal changes affect us all differently. Winter might make you more prone to depression or binge-watching , but chances are it doesn't actually shrink your brain. The same can't be said for common shrews ( Sorex araneus ). \nThat's right, according to an October 2017 study published in Current Biology, the shrew's skull may shrink by up to 20 percent in anticipation of winter. Researchers from Max Planck Institute for Ornithology investigated the so-called \"Dehnel phenomenon\" to see if observations of skull-shrunk shrews held up to scientific scrutiny \u2014 or shrewtiny, if you will. \nBecause sure, while past studies pointed to a loss in cranial mass, skeptics wondered if this wasn't due to larger shrews dying out in the winter. Past studies were based largely on general observations, while this latest study actually followed a dozen individual shrews across three seasons and measured their tiny heads. \nThe researchers used live traps to capture specimens during the summer of 2014 through the fall of 2015. Each captured shrew received a cranial X-ray and a subdermal microchip for tracking purposes. X-ray image of a common shrew Javier L\u00e1zaro \nWhile the researchers expected large shrew mortality to be a major factor in the phenomenon, their study revealed that common shrews do in fact exhibit a winter decline in cranium size and a rebound in the spring. \nThe shrews in the study also exhibited a loss and rebound in body mass across several major organs, a decrease in spine length and a mass decrease in the brain itself of between 20 and 30 percent. \nResearcher Javier Lazaro stresses that more research is needed to see exactly how this amazing shrinking of shrew works \u2014 and what effect it might have on the animal's cognition. But the adaptation seems largely geared at surviving the winter without the aid of hibernation , migration or, of course, Netflix.
