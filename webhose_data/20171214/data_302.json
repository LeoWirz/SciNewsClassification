An oscillator is an indicator that is used as a counter trend showing when the market is overbought or oversold. These indicators are momentum based. The CMF is based largely on the Accumulation Distribution Line; it compares the close value with the high and the low for that same day. Generally, CMF indicator could be used as an indicator of buying and selling pressure. When CMF is above zero it is indicator of buying pressure and when it is below zero it is indicator of selling pressure. \nTaking a deeper dive into the numbers, Velan Inc Sv (VLN.TO) has a 50-day Moving Average of 17.85, the 200-day Moving Average is 17.71, and the 7-day is noted at 17.93. A popular tool among technical stock analysts is the moving average. Moving averages are considered to be lagging indicators that simply take the average price of a stock over a specific period of time. Moving averages can be very useful for identifying peaks and troughs. They may also be used to help the trader figure out proper support and resistance levels for the stock. \nValue investors may be scanning the shelves for bargain stocks. They may be looking to spot those shares that haven\u2019t been doing a whole lot and are being generally overlooked by the investing world. Value investors may be searching for stocks with lower price to earnings ratios that possess higher dividend yields. Investors looking for growth stocks may be willing to shell out a little more for a stock that has the possibility of increasing EPS at a quicker pace. Some investors may favor one category of stocks over another, but they may need to find a combination at some point. As markets tend to move in cycles, it may be necessary to align the portfolio to the category that is best positioned to make consistent gains in the future. \nTraders may be relying in part on technical stock analysis. Velan Inc Sv (VLN.TO) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -8.73. Despite the name, CCI can be used on other investment tools such as stocks. The CCI was designed to typically stay within the reading of -100 to +100. Traders may use the indicator to determine stock trends or to identify overbought/oversold conditions. A CCI reading above +100 would imply that the stock is overbought and possibly ready for a correction. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally. \nAt the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Velan Inc Sv (VLN.TO) is 18.12. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available. \nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one of multiple popular technical indicators created by J. Welles Wilder. Wilder introduced RSI in his book \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u201d which was published in 1978. RSI measures the magnitude and velocity of directional price movements. The data is represented graphically by fluctuating between a value of 0 and 100. The indicator is computed by using the average losses and gains of a stock over a certain time period. RSI can be used to help spot overbought or oversold conditions.

He started saying how he watches us at every turn, he slows when he sees an officer on a traffic stop, he slows way down on the interstate and takes the lane closest to the officer to force everybody else to slow down or move over, he watches our backs while we eat, stand in line, or use the bathroom. He went on to say how he wishes more people had watched his sons backs, they were both LEO\u0092s, one was killed during a traffic stop on the interstate and the other was shot while in his lunch break.\nHis story has weighed heavily on me the past week, and has me doing a bunch of soul searching.\nDang that's a heck of a story BigPig and it should help to know people really do want to help.

In the composition includes: an autonomous fighting machine 9\u0410331\u041c\u041a-1 and antiaircraft missile module 9\u041c334 with four anti-aircraft guided missiles 9\u041c9331. At MAKS-2013 was presented on the chassis of the Indian TATA. The affected area expanded to height - 10 km, distance - 15. The crew of 2 persons. Chance to destroy any target 98% as a minimum. Significantly improving penetrating power of fragments of warhead. The system is fully automated. Modules weighing 15 tons are installed on ships of the Russian Navy.\nShort description: The TOR missile system (Russian: \u0422\u041e\u0420; English: torus) is an all-weather low to medium altitude, short-range surface-to-air missile system designed for engaging airplanes, helicopters, cruise missiles, precision guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles and short-range ballistic threats (Anti-Munitions). Originally developed by the Soviet Union under the GRAU designation 9K330, the system is commonly known by its NATO reporting name, SA-15 Gauntlet. A navalized variant was developed under the name 3K95 \"Kinzhal\", also known as the SA-N-9 \"Gauntlet\". TOR was also the first air defence system in the world designed from the start to shoot down precision guided weapons like the AGM-86 ALCM day and night, in bad weather and jamming situation. TOR can detect targets while on the move. The vehicle must stop intermittently when firing, although trials are being conducted to eliminate this restriction.\n\u0422\u041e\u0420-\u041c2\u041a\u041c (9\u041a331\u041c\u041a\u041c) -

December 7, 2017 09:29 GMT Sansa Stark in a still from Game Of Thrones season 6 Getty \nSophie Turner has shared some details about possible Game Of Thrones season 8 airdate and revealed what is next in store for Sansa Stark after her adviser, Littlefinger was killed off in season 7 finale. \nTalking to Variety about season 8 filming , Turner revealed, \"We started in October, so we're maybe like a tenth of the way through. We've got six or seven months left.\" \nTalking about her upcoming ventures, she said, \"Yeah, I'm really excited. Game of Thrones comes out in 2019. Dark Phoenix is in November. Then I have a couple indie movies coming out. I'm a producer on my next movie [\"Girl Who Fell From the Sky\"]. So I'm really excited about the future.\" \nLooks like fans will have to wait until 2019 for the next season of the HBO fantasy drama. The 21-year-old X-Men actress also revealed that next season will be \"tricky\" for her without Littlefinger aka Petyr Baelish. \nShe said, \"It's going to be tricky for her, because at the end of last season, she felt that she had everything set up. She had her family back together. They were in control of the North again.\" Sansa Stark and Little Finger aka Lord Petyr Baelish in Game Of Thrones Helen Sloan/HBO \nThe HBO actress continued, \"This season, there's a new threat, and all of a sudden she finds herself somewhat back in the deep end. And without Littlefinger, it's a test for her of whether she can get through it. It's a big challenge for her, without this master manipulator having her back. This season is more a passionate fight for her than a political, manipulative kind of fight.\" \nThe actress also previewed an \"emotional\" final season. She explained to the outlet, \"When we all had the read-through for the final season, it was very, very emotional. For the first time in \"Thrones\" history, we had everyone there. All of the Americans wanted to come over. \" \nTeasing the end, the Sansa actress continued, \"Every single cast member was pretty much there. We're all kind of feeling the end of it coming. We're all staying in town a little longer, going out for more meals, trying to get together more. We're all trying not to take it for granted any more.\" \nThe final season will feature an epic battle between the living and the dead, aka White Walkers. The season 7 ended with the King of the White Walkers riding Daenerys' dragon, Viserion, who brought down the wall and helped the wights to march south. \nIn a recent interview , Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays Jamie Lannister in the HBO fantasy-drama, teased that the upcoming battle will find many favourite characters will turn into the blue-eyed walkers fighting for the Nights King. \nHinting that Jamie could be one of them Waldau told Esquire, \"The fear is that I would be turned into one of those undead. That would suck. You know some of the main characters are going to get turned.\" \n\"There are going to be some blue-eyed main characters running around. And, god, I hope it's not me. That's three hours of make-up in the morning,\" Coster-Waldau added of the upcoming season.

The Australian dollar declined after another disappointing set of economic data. \nIn Japan, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average recovered most of its worst slide in nine months after US stocks steadied. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was up after falling for eight consecutive days to Wednesday. \nThe Australian dollar dropped to the lowest since June after October trade data missed estimates. Weaker-than-expected third-quarter GDP earlier this week reinforced views that the central bank won\u2019t adjust monetary policy any time soon, sending the Aussie lower. \n\"Japanese stocks will probably regain their calm as the currency market hasn\u2019t fallen into a typical risk-off vicious circle after the selloff in Asian stocks yesterday,\" said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Nomura Securities in Tokyo. \"Shares are looking cheaper.\" \nGlobal markets have succumbed to a bout of profit taking this week with eight days of losses for Asian equities culminating on Wednesday in the biggest slide since last December for the region\u2019s stocks index. \nTechnology stocks, this year\u2019s biggest winners, have posted the largest declines along with emerging-market shares, also standout winners in 2017. \nElsewhere, sterling weakened as efforts to rescue Brexit talks appeared to stumble. The looniest fell as the Bank of Canada kept borrowing costs on hold at its last interest-rate decision of 2017 and reiterated it will be \"cautious\" with future moves. \nHere are some of the key events facing markets in the coming days: \nThe US faces a partial government shutdown after money runs out on December 8 if Congress can\u2019t agree on a spending bill by then. US employers probably hired at a robust pace in November as the unemployment rate held at an almost 17-year low. \nThe Labour Department\u2019s jobs report on Friday may also show a bump up in average hourly earnings. \nThese are the main moves in markets: \nStocks \nThe Topix index was up 1.2% at the close in Tokyo and the Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.5%. The Nikkei dropped 2% on Thursday. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.5%. \nSouth Korea\u2019s Kospi index was 0.3% lower. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index was up 0.4%, and the Shanghai Composite Index was down 0.5%. Futures on the S&P 500 rose 0.2%. The underlying measure closed little changed. \nThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 0.5%. \nCurrencies \nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1%. The Australian dollar fell 0.2% to 75.46 US cents. The yen fell 0.2% to 112.49 per dollar. The euro traded at $1.1790. The pound added to losses, falling 0.2% to $1.3366. \nBonds \nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries held at 2.34%. Australia\u2019s 10-year yield rose one basis point to 2.51%. \nCommodities \nWest Texas Intermediate crude was up 0.2% at $56.07 a barrel after falling 2.9% on Wednesday.

Picture taken November 16, 2017. Reuters \nScientists at the Fudan University, Shanghai, China have developed an affordable, cold-enduring lithium-ion battery for use in winters. \nAccording to the journal Angewandte Chemie, the battery is made of hard-carbon anode and lithium-rich vanadium phosphate cathode. The hard carbon anode of the battery gives higher kinetics to the lithium ions even at a low temperature which keeps it functional during the extreme weather conditions. \nProf. Yonggang Wang, a Physical Chemistry Professor at the Department of Chemistry, Fudan University, Shanghai, China said, \"the fuel cell keeps the high-energy density characteristics of conventional lithium-ion batteries and exhibits the supercapacitor-like high power and long cycle life.\" The battery could work at temperatures as low as minus 40 degrees Celsius. \nThe researcher stated, \"this achievement arises from the inherent low-temperature ability of the vanadium phosphate cathode and the fast kinetics of the prelithiated hard-carbon anode.\" \nThe battery which is still under its development process would be a best suited for electric car engines. \nMeanwhile, the researchers at the Empa, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology and the University of Geneva (UNIGE) have now developed all solid batteries as an alternative to the lithium-ion batteries. \nThe all solid state batteries have potential to store more energy while maintaining high safety and reliability. \nHans Hagemann, Professor in the Physical Chemistry Department in the UNIGE's Faculty of Sciences said that the scientists are researching on a suitable solid non-toxic ionic conductor which could transfer sodium ions to the anode and cathode in the cell. The system also needs to be chemically and thermally stable. \nThe researchers have discovered closo-borane, a boron compound which allows free circulation of the sodium ions. The closo-borane has limited risk to catch fire while recharging. Leo Duchene, a researcher at Empa's Materials for Energy Conversion Laboratory said, \"The difficulty was establishing close contact between the battery's three layers: the anode, consisting of solid metallic sodium; the cathode, a mixed sodium chromium oxide; and the electrolyte, the closo-borane.\" \nThe scientists tested the battery over 250 charge and discharge cycles and found 85% energy retaining capacity.

A few remaining appeals and retrials will become the responsibility of the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals, which performs the same role with the now-closed Rwandan tribunal. The ramifications of the ICTY\u2019s work extend far beyond the region. It was the first such court to prosecute war crimes since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials at the end of the second world war. It indicted 161 people, including former presidents and prime ministers. All were caught, handed themselves in, or died. Ninety were convicted. Nineteen were acquitted. None is a fugitive. The court heard evidence from more than 4,650 witnesses in cases relating to genocide, ethnic cleansing, mass murder and sexual violence.\nOnce a relatively liberal communist country, Yugoslavia disintegrated in the 1990s. It was a federation of six republics and two autonomous provinces\u2014and a mish-mash of nationalities. Many regional leaders transmogrified into nationalists and war took hold. If Croatia was going to become independent then many of its Serb inhabitants would fight to remain in a Greater Serbian state. And Croat nationalists wanted a Greater Croatia that included Croat-inhabited parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. And so on. As the Bosnian war ground on and Serb forces besieged Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, foreign powers could not agree how to respond. No one wanted to send troops to separate the parties. But they all approved the prosecution of war criminals, so backed the establishment of the tribunal. At first the court, based in The Hague, had little money. It also had no police of its own to arrest anyone indicted. But over the years its influence increased. It demanded that the Balkan states and others carry out arrests, and also got help from NATO-led peacekeepers in Bosnia. It succeeded in making the handing over of those indicted a political issue, with sanctions slapped on Serbia and Croatia when they dragged their feet.\n Ivanka 15 Why the Brexit negotiations are about to get harder a day ago See all updates Some of its achievements were legal and some political. Several of the most evil of the wartime actors were imprisoned. The tribunal gave victims and civilians a voice, and often justice, in a way that would not otherwise have been possible. It created new legal precedents. Sexual violence is now considered a war crime. It established the groundwork for other courts, including those that looked into horrors committed in Rwanda and Sierra Leone, and the International Criminal Court (ICC). Its 2.5m pages of transcripts provide an extraordinary archive. It established that genocide had taken place when some 8,000 Bosniaks (Muslims) were murdered as Srebrenica fell. To weigh against all this there must be the acknowledgment that many believe that justice was not always done. The hopes that many had for the tribunal have at times been disappointed. It did not accelerate the process of reconciliation. Many believe there was interference, from America and elsewhere, in its work. In cases related to Kosovar Albanians, in particular, prosecutors alleged witness-tampering.\nAccording to Eric Gordy, a sociologist at University College London\u2019s School of Slavonic and East European Studies, the court tried to end impunity for war crimes and in this \u201cit was partially successful\u201d. It was founded at a time when there was still some consensus about the need for this. Now, sadly, that is no longer the case. There is no international tribunal indicting anyone for war crimes in Syria. Russia and America are among those countries that have either withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the ICC or never ratified its statute. It remains to be seen whether the Yugoslav tribunal will become a relic from a more hopeful time or a trailblazer in a cause that was always bound to suffer setbacks.\nPrevious Why \u201cdeath taxes\u201d have fallen out of favour Next Why the French are arguing over a small dot", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eric gordy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "the international criminal tribunal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "icty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "international criminal court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nited nations security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mechanism for international criminal tribunals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university college london\u2019s school of slavonic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "yugoslavia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "srebrenica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rwanda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bosnia-herzegovina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sierra leone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the hague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bosnia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nuremberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "serbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarajevo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "croatia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:34:59.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5ed52f8d70bfcba90667c25342de6575b2d3f88b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspatEWvF9gXhTdM1w_kURGtHOE0Df1qBnjd_BQ3brtpVFLRtXwKdetSZRwVVUMY52kK2hOFVKSI5z1ltC0uKUXH00AaxPTVJnL4OLem0ZAmHIE-", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/Washington-Hoteis.d178318.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Washington: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "Metro Points Hotel-Washington North:", "title_full": "Metro Points Hotel-Washington North: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-11-07T19:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "edbac8d102fb05101f5cef126a6915dc0602445a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspatEWvF9gXhTdM1w_kURGtHOE0Df1qBnjd_BQ3brtpVFLRtXwKdetSZRwVVUMY52kK2hOFVKSI5z1ltC0uKUXH00AaxPTVJnL4QUoNjH5LKPD_iCw_HKilPI6M2OW7AnRvUKVj5THW7wk-", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-29T12:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Expedia and I the Purchase of Service Not Rendered and Paid For..hummm What do you Think?

Google collaborated with MediaTek to ensure that Android Oreo (Go edition) works well on its line of processors, enabling a faster time-to-market mechanism for device manufacturers, and ensuring a quality Android smartphone experience that is both secure and affordable for devices with 512MB to 1GB of memory. This marks one of the first times that entry-level SoCs are ready to be used shortly after the latest version of Android, in this case Android 8.1 Oreo, has been released to the Android Open Source Project. \nWith Android Oreo (Go edition), Google has optimized its OS platform, first party apps and the Google Play\u2122 Store to improve the capabilities of entry level devices. Limited processing power and storage are top pain points for entry-level device users. Android Oreo (Go edition) was created to not only address these issues, but to also ensure that the devices are secure and that users have more control over data usage. \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) leverages the existing Google Play Store ecosystem to deliver apps that run smoothly on low memory devices. This improves the overall user experience with, and support for, devices that have 512MB to 1GB of memory, which results in significant bill of materials (BOM) cost savings. These savings enable device makers to provide the 400 million users who buy entry-level smartphones every year, a better option. \n\u201cEntry-level devices are the gateway to the internet for many people, and we want to make sure everyone has a great experience when they use these devices,\u201d said Sameer Samat, VP of Product Management, Android & Google Play. \u201cWe\u2019re excited that Android Oreo (Go edition) will significantly improve storage, performance, data management, and security.\u201d \n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement builds upon our existing work with Google, including our recent collaboration on Google\u2019s GMS Express to speed up the certification process,\u201d said TL Lee, General Manager of MediaTek\u2019s Wireless Communication business unit. \u201cWith Android Oreo (Go edition), we are partnering with Google to tackle the performance challenges of lower memory phones, improving the user experience of entry level smartphones for consumers in key markets across India, the Middle East & Africa, Latin America and South East Asia.\u201d \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) leverages MediaTek\u2019s acclaimed turnkey references and chipsets that are designed specifically to reduce product development time and compliance testing. A wide range of MediaTek SoC\u2019s supports Android Oreo (Go edition), including the MT6739 and MT6737 for 4G devices, as well as the MT6580 for 3G devices. This gives device makers the range of capabilities they need to develop devices for specific price points and markets. \nAndroid Oreo (Go edition) smartphones powered by MediaTek will be available in world-wide market by Q1, 2018. \nFor more information about the program, please explore: https://www.android.com/ \n*Google, Android, and Google Play are trademarks of Google LLC. \nAbout MediaTek Inc.
