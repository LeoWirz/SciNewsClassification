I thought to myself \"This is it.\" A clean slate is exactly what I need and I'm sharing it with you as well. \n\nI have a renewed energy, and I'm dedicated to moving forward.

I made a cup of coffee, I said a prayer, acknowledged with a grateful heart and asked for help to be the best me I can today. \n\nIf someone came in and wiped your slate clean, how would you fill it? \n\nClick here to share your thoughts on this post! \n\nMotivational Member    MILLIE5522 \n\"The measure of success i... \n\nReached my goal weight of 125 lbs on 17th September 2012.

(TSX-V: EAM ) (\u201cEast Africa\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to announce the Company has received government approval of East Africa\u2019s Mining Licence Agreement for the Terakimti Oxide Gold Project (the \u201cTerakimti Project\u201d) at the Company\u2019s 70% owned Harvest Project located in the Tigray National Regional State of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (\u201cEthiopia\u201d). The Mining Licence Agreement has been formally approved by the Ministry of Mines, Petroleum, and Natural Gas (the \u201cMinistry of Mines\u201d), the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers. The Company will now focus on finalizing its previously announced Project Financing (refer to the Company\u2019s news release dated November 10, 2017) and proceed with engineering and development of the Terakimti Project. Andrew Lee Smith, East Africa\u2019s C.E.O. stated, \u201cThis is an extremely important achievement for East Africa, and we appreciate the efforts of the Government and Ministry of Mines in the development of the Mining Licence Agreement for Terakimti. We plan to move forward as soon as possible with engineering and development of the project\u201d. The Terakimti Project will provide East Africa the opportunity to benefit from establishing the first commercial heap leach operation in the country, and provide the basis for additional exploration and development to grow the Company\u2019s mineral resources in Ethiopia. Terakimti Oxide Gold Project Profile: Mineral Resource: Indicated Resource of 1,110,000 tonnes grading 3.20 grams gold and 23.6 grams silver per tonne containing 114,000 ounces of gold and 841,000 ounces of silver; Heap Leach Recoveries from Column Testwork 1 : up to 74.8 % gold and 39.4% silver; Proposed Mining Method: Conventional open pit; Proposed Processing Technology: Heap leaching to produce gold\u2013silver dore. (1) see East Africa Metals News Release dated January 23, 2017 for summary of metallurgical test work results. Proposed Mining Operation: The Terakimti Project is proposed as an open pit mining operation followed by heap leaching and on site processing to produce gold-silver dore. The combination of near surface oxide gold and silver mineralization, hosted in soft rock when compared to other deposits, high and rapid extraction of gold at coarse crush sizes in metallurgical testwork, along with satisfactory percolation rates all support this strategy for the development of the Terakimti Project. Project Infrastructure: The Terakimti Project is located approximately 600 kilometres north of the Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. The region has daily, commercial air service from Addis Ababa. The existing transportation and power infrastructure is located close to the project site and enhances the development potential of the proposed operation. The proposed mining operation would utilize grid power for the project, for which the nearest high tension power line is approximately 7 kilometres away. Primary road access to the site is by paved highway from the town of Shire, 40 kilometres south of the project. Shire has a population of approximately 60,000 people and sufficient services to serve as a base for off-site project activities. Environmental Impact and Socio-Economic Assessment: An independent Environmental Impact and Socio-Economic Assessment (\u201cEISA\u201d) study has been completed by Beles Engineering Pvt. Ltd. Co. of Ethiopia, and forms an integral part of the Mining Licence Agreement. This EISA examined the beneficial and adverse aspects of the proposed mining operation and concluded that the local population is in favor of the project, and the anticipated benefits would be positive and very important to the local community and to the local and regional governments. The EISA further concluded that the adverse impacts identified can be mitigated through implementation of the proposed management and monitoring plans, and therefore recommended project implementation. Mineral Resources: Terakimti Updated Oxide Mineral Resources 2 Terakimti Sulphide Mineral Resources Additional gold copper resources underlie the Terakimti oxide resource and the Company plans to continue its assessment of these resources for future development. Terakimti Mineral Resources 3 More information on the Company can be viewed at the Company\u2019s website: www.eastafricametals.com .

Potter Training Tips: Understanding and Managing Resource Guarding!", "text": "Col. Potter Training Tips: Understanding and Managing Resource Guarding! Resource Guarding is a natural instinct, brought on by anxiety, especially in a dog who is under-confident about other things in his life. The very best course of action is to avoid situations that threaten the dog and its possessions. Allow your dog to chew in peace when appropriate and never try and take the toy away except as part of a positive exchange. Resource Guarding What is resource guarding? Resource guarding (RG) is when a dog has possession of an object that he/she thinks is valuable, and is growling/snapping/biting in an effort to protect/keep that object. The object may be something we deem silly, for example, a piece of Kleenex is a common object dogs guard...or even empty bowls. Some dogs will even guard spots, like a bed or couch. And in few, rarer cases dogs will see their owner is a resource and guard that person. Why does my dog do this? Generally speaking, RG is a genetic, inborn behavior. This behavior evolved because in the wild, possession of something is important, and not allowing that thing to be stolen is a matter of life and death. Many dogs retain this behavior, despite there being ample resources. Just like hunting, playing, and mating, RG is a survival skill built into the dog. In some cases, RG can be learned. This happens most often when a bored dog starts to chew objects. The owner approaches and removes the object, often times scolding the dog. Unfortunately, this only teaches the dog to steal/chew objects out of the owner\u2019s sight to avoid punishment, and/OR it will teach him that he needs to protect the object from the owner, as he sees the owner as a thief. Things like anxiety, being in a new home, or the addition of another dog or pet can increase these behaviors, or cause them to appear seemingly spontaneously. Dogs that are under-confident in other aspects of their lives tend to be guarders . This puppy is at the first level of warning, freezing in place and giving a hard stare, his paw on his toy, because his Alpha sister is standing right there, ready to jump in and grab his special toy. Know the signs so you can avoid trouble! The timely distraction of a training session, with \u201csits\u201d and \u201cdowns\u201d and great treats, avoided further escalation in this case. What\u2019s with all the biting, snapping, growling? These behaviors are part of the dogs hierarchy of warnings . The warnings play out like this: Freezing in place/hard staring Placing face against the object, putting more paws on the object Lip lifting Warning/air snapping ( these will not make contac t) Warning snaps with contact ( does not break skin ) Biting that breaks skin Full attack fight that must be broken up. Generally speaking, most dogs will travel up the hierarchy, over time, giving stronger and stronger warnings, until they finally end up biting or attacking. Now, how hard the dog bites, depends on his learned bite inhibition . Bite inhibition is learned as a puppy from littermates, and from his owners when he comes home. If a dog has good bite inhibition, he will be very restrained in his bites, if he has poor control, he may bite very hard, and sooner than a dog with better control. Some dogs go up this hierarchy, gradually, over time. For example a dog being pestered by another dog while he eats may progress over weeks or months until they finally fight, but other dogs may go up the warning hierarchy VERY quickly - so quickly that they run through all the signals in a blink of an eye. These are the types of dogs that many people site as \u201cbiting without warning\". What actually is happening is perhaps the owner did not see the signals, or chose to ignore or punish the lower level signals. The point being, dogs do not want to attack over their object, they want to do everything possible to keep their object , but without causing harm, this is ritualized aggression . Its when the issue is pushed (for example a human that continues to take objects away despite warnings, or another dog that continues to bully the RG) the dog's behavior can, and usually does, escalate. Should I use corrections to stop this? Isn't my dog trying to dominant me? Dogs that RG are not trying to climb a social ladder, or overthrow the humans as the \"leader\". In fact, these are the dogs in the household with confidence or anxiety issues. These are dogs that are, in a sense, \"paranoid\" that everyone is out to get their \"valued thing\". Confident dogs do not feel the need to RG most objects, as they are positive no one is even going to try to take their stuff. However, most \"normal\" dogs, with average to high confidence, may guard something of very high value - like a piece of raw meat, a new toy, etc. - when the dog doesn't normally get to have those things. It is the abnormally high value of the object that elicits the behavior. Strangers can also create the behavior. A dog that would never RG from the family may snap at a guest, the anxiety from not knowing the person as well triggers the behavior. Or, in the case of a party or gathering at the house, the dog may simply be over-stimulated. Corrections for this behavior, such as yelling at the dog, making hissing sounds, physically punishing the dog, poking him, or removing the object as punishment are all methods with a very high likelihood of backfiring, plus making the behavior worse. Since this is often anxiety based, punishment will only increase anxiety, and also damage your relationship with your dog. It puts you two in conflict every time he finds an object he likes. What should I do first? First, we want to manage ( prevent ) the behavior as much as possible. Pick up your clothes and things, remove dog toys and treats from the floor, moving and covering trashcans, and so forth. Use x-pens and baby gates to keep your dog out of areas where he is going to find objects to guard. The reason this is so important is that every time the dog practices the behavior, it is becoming more and more ingrained. Preventing it helps keep the dog at the level he/she is already at, while you implement training. If the dog guards food/food bowls, feed him separately from other dogs, preferably in his own room or crate. For dogs that guard food bowls/food management: If the dog is being aggressive with humans, one of the best things you can start is hand-feeding ALL meals. Many dogs do not make the connection that food comes from YOU, and instead think it magically appears in their magic bowl (hence guarding an empty bowl). Couch/bed guarding management: Attaching a short leash to help guide the dog off the spot will work in an emergency, but placing cardboard boxes or other objects on the surface that discourage usage is preferred. Also remember to close doors or use baby gates to keep the dog away from the surface they guard. Make sure to discuss the management plan with all family members so that everyone is on board and there is a better chance of success. Ok, so I am preventing the behavior, can I start training now? Yes, but first... All this training advice is meant as a guideline . Different dogs will progress at different rates due to temperament, history, environment, handler skill, and so forth. It is very important to understand that RG takes a decent amount of time to \"fix\" with most dogs, and the training will have to be repeated, from the beginning, with all other family members to ensure the dog has generalized the behavior. Patience is key. Also, if your dog is breaking skin, you are otherwise afraid or intimidated by your dog, or you in any way feel you may be harmed (dog size is a factor to consider), then its time to hire a professional to help you. Keep in mind, most trainers are not experienced in aggression cases and will not take them on. Also be aware that many of the trainers that agree to take on aggression cases may not be truly qualified to do so . Your best bet is to select your trainer very wisely or hire a good behaviorist, in either case , one who understands and practices Relationship Based Training.

However, a Sena minister was in Surat recently promoting a BJP candidate. \nMaharashtra Minister of State for Water Resources and Water Conservation Vijay Shivtare, who is the Sena legislator from Purandar in Maharashtra, was in Surat\u2019s Choryasi Assembly constituency on November 22 to attend the election campaign of BJP candidate Jhankhana Patel, daughter of deceased BJP legislator from the constituency Raja Patel. Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar was also present at the rally to support Jhankhana Patel. \nChoryasi has always been a BJP stronghold. Following Raja Patel\u2019s death due to dengue in 2015, his daughter contested the by-election and retained the seat. \u201cNo city in the country has seen the kind of rapid development the city of Surat has undergone,\u201d Shivtare was quoted as saying at a rally, in a press release issued by the BJP Surat (City) office.It further quoted Shivtare as saying, \u201cI am not attending this campaign on behalf of my party, but for my family, as Rajabhai Patel was a very close friend of mine. We lived together in Mumbai for sometime. Rajabhai and I joined politics during the same time.\u201d \nThe release said Shivtare asked people to vote in large numbers for Jhankhana Patel. \u201cIf Jhankhana Patel wins with a heavy margin, it will be a tribute to Rajabhai Patel in a true sense,\u201d Shivtare was quoted as saying. Shivtare did not respond to several calls made by this paper. Shelar declined to comment. The Shiv Sena has fielded 47 candidates in Gujarat, especially in Surat and Rajkot. The party has fielded 30 candidates for the first phase of polls, while 17 will contest the second phase, said Rajul Patel, Shiv Sena corporator from Mumbai, who is part of the team constituted by the Sena to finalise candidates and draw up a strategy for the Gujarat polls.

Two Akali workers were injured in the clash. SAD alleged that Moga administration deliberately delayed issuing them no-dues pending NOCs (no objection certificates) due to which many of their aspirants failed to file the papers. \nThey alleged that administration worked under the pressure of local Congress MLAs. SAD also alleged that most of their candidates failed to file papers for Baghapurana Municipal Council and Dharamkot Nagar Panchayat polls. \nThey claimed that just one of their candidate was able to file nomination papers for Baghapurana Municipal Council polls out of the total fifteen wards. Kamaljeet Kaur of SAD filed papers from Ward Number 11. \nMoga SAD (Rural) president Tirath Singh Mahla alleged that their workers were injured after Congress workers opened attack on them. \u201cCongress workers resorted to hooliganism and made our candidates run away. Some even snatched papers from hands of our workers. The administration completely failed today to control the situation. Our ex-councillor, Pawan Dhand, even got an arm fractured and another senior SAD worker Harmail Singh was thrashed. His turban fell off,\u201d alleged Mahla. \nIn Dharamkot, Barjinder Singh Brar, son of former SAD minister Tota Singh, alleged that administration acted in a biased manner. \u201cMany of our candidates were not able to file papers. Those who did will see their papers rejected after scrutiny because we were not issued NOCs by the administration. It has been a complete failure of administration,\u201d he said. He said that if papers of SAD candidates are rejected because of NOCs, administration will be responsible for it. Moga Deputy Commissioner Dilraj Singh, meanwhile, refuted all allegations and said that NOCs were issued timely on Wednesday morning and candidates had ample time to file the papers. \n\u201cFirstly, we had issued NOCs today morning.

We now know that his father\u2019s throat was slit with a sharp object while his mother was strangulated to death,\u201d said a police officer. \nPrateek and his wife alerted their neighbours about the incident, and subsequently informed police. After primary inquiry and investigation, police arrested Parag. \u201cWe have arrested Parag Kshirsagar on charges of murdering his parents, and trying to commit suicide. As per our primary information, Parag is an alcoholic and is currently unemployed. He often used to get into arguments with his family members,\u201d said Senior Inspector Appasaheb Shewale, in-charge of Vishrambag police station. \nParag had a fight with his parents the night before he killed them, said police. He used a piece of glass to slit his father\u2019s throat and a rope to strangle his mother, they said. Prakash Kshirsagar worked in a construction company, while his wife worked with the education department at its Cantonment area office, said police.

Photo by Audrey Melton Priests Open Up Ahead of Day For Night David Garrick | December 7, 2017 | 4:00am Music can be so many things that you can love a band for who they are, what they stand for, and who they're striving to be for just as many reasons as you can adore their sound. That's how most would describe Washington DC's Priests , a band that's so much more than just another punk band. Between running their own label Sister Polygon Records to playing shows for admirable causes, the four piece happened to drop one of the best albums of 2017 with Nothing Feels Natural .\nNow after playing here earlier in the year, they're returning to Houston to wow all in attendance at Day For Night . the Houston Press took a moment to chat with lead singer Katie Alice Greer to talk about genres, running a record label, and being a touring band in today's already crowded space.\nSince the band started out five years ago, music journalists have called them everything from political to punk, but the labels are something that comes from everyone else it seems, and not the four piece.\n\"I don't think we often think about a genre when we make music. It is something that we're labeled with after the fact, and I understand its purpose,\" says Greer. \"We started playing in people's basements and had a set up that's traditional for a rock or punk band, so I understand why people categorize us that way. It's just not the most interesting way to think about music, in my opinion. We just try to make music that's exciting to us.\"\nThe band's latest offering, this year's Nothing Feels Natural took a while to come out, in fact the band almost broke up prior to it getting released.\n\"We had some rough patches, and if I'm being completely honest, Priests has always been going through some kind of \"rough\" patches. We've always been a band of four equal voices, which as you might expect, can cause conflict between strong personalities,\" Greer says. \"The challenge of communicating has always been as rewarding as it has been frustrating, it teaches you a lot if you're willing to hear its lessons. We learned a lot from the trials and errors of the recording process as well. We found that recording the songs many times was actually really useful to the songwriting process, but it was a shame that it was so expensive and time-consuming to record so many versions that we thought would be the final result. So this time we're trying to build that process in before we start, rather than after the fact.\"\n\"Nothing Feels Natural\" is as captivating as it is intense Photo Courtesy of Sister Polygon Records The band also runs their own label, something that can be daunting and difficult for any one person to attempt to do much less a band trying to write and record as well as tour. With Sister Polygon Records, the band who has also dropped work with Don Giovanni Records finds something rewarding in releasing their own material as well as that of others.\n\"I personally like being responsible for every step in this process,\" Greer says. \"No offense to the non-morons running big labels, but I don't really want some numbers guy, (and it's almost always a guy) who knows nothing about music (and who doesn't respect it) the final say on our album art, how often we get to release records, or how it will get marketed. I guess at heart I'm the same person that I was when I was a little kid, I don't like people telling me what to do.\"\nUntil recently, the members of Priests were attempting to be a band, run a label, and hold onto day jobs at the same time.\n\"We all had outside jobs until this year, right now we've been touring so much that we can't work anywhere else. I've usually juggled a few different jobs at the same time. Right now it's the band, the label, and doing some writing of my own on the side,\" Greer says.\nEXPAND Priests will bring their captivating and intense live show to this year's Day For Night festival. Photo by Audrey Melton While the band has made their name as an amazing live act, they hadn't really played a festival until this year. Playing festivals means that the band can earn better money. According to Greer, the strength of the live show and playing festivals were all things that came in time.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://open.spotify.com/album/4Q4PAknSA2wgEY0VPLCqAR", "http://sisterpolygonrecords.bigcartel.com/", "https://www.666priests666.com/", "https://dayfornight.io/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "audrey melton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katie alice greer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david garrick", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sister polygon records", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "don giovanni records", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "polygon records", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston press", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington dc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:20:08.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15badb2ea48cba13f0a3b228e5021622aab2dd74", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg83.Qbxd2VNsvuYb6EmDdFYDEoeP1l4ZH3vbg5ijZERjsf8c9t0ZC5DUao.fvfO.OF6AqRcUEeDtA--", "site_full": "www.marilynvossavant.com", "site": "marilynvossavant.com", "site_section": "http://www.marilynvossavant.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=1", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Marilyn vos Savant \u2022 View forum - Magazine column", "title": "Four-digit number problem", "title_full": "Marilyn vos Savant \u2022 View topic - Four-digit number problem", "published": "2017-12-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "11ea0ec32f61f98b53e531c42d44bc472937454d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg83.Qbxd2VNsvuYb6EmDdFYDEoeP1l4ZH3vbg5ijZERjsf8c9t0ZC5DUao.fvfO.OHEQ7naH5OUK0cP8FZJrrf7", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Gofer", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">is how the problem even could be solved using reasoning alone and not math skills.
