Our level of maturity is exactly as it should be, and we are going through the stages that people of our age ought to be going through. In other areas, this is not so. We are complex people, irregular, uneven. In all of us there are areas fixated in some emotional ice age, areas that have not felt the freeing warmth of the sun. \n\nWe cannot expect ourselves to move forward all at once. Not only is it okay to move slowly - it's often the only way it can be. Confusion, conflict, or pain may have caused us to let our memories or feelings be frozen safely away. This has been a long process, and we can allow ourselves more time to heal. The task now is not to deny or hide from these changes, but to have confidence that the healing warmth of the program will reflect on all areas of our lives and help make us whole. \n\nI am thankful I am given both time and patience in which to continue my growth.

He is charged with leading a terror organization, engaging in terror propaganda and other crimes. \nThe trial is one of many against Demirtas, who is imprisoned in northwestern Turkey. He did not attend Thursday\u2019s trial. \nDemirtas was arrested last year when the government launched a crackdown following a failed coup attempt, which critics say has been expanded to target all government opponents and dissenting voices. \nThe government accuses the HDP, the nations\u2019 third-largest party in parliament, of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK. The HDP denies the accusation. \nProsecutors accuse Demirtas of being a leader of Turkey\u2019s outlawed Kurdish rebels and hold him responsible for street violence that broke out in 2014 during protests against government policies on Syria. \nThe violence led to more than 30 deaths. \nThe New York-based advocacy group, Human Rights Watch, criticized the trial, calling it \u201cpart of a wider pattern of repression against government critics.\u201d \n\u201cHolding the leader of a major opposition party in pre-trial detention for over a year on flimsy charges is another example of the political abuse of the criminal justice system we are repeatedly seeing in Turkey,\u201d said Hugh Williamson, Human Rights Watch\u2019s director for Europe and Central Asia. \nThe Turkish parliament stripped lawmakers of legal immunity last year, paving the way for the arrest of several HDP legislators \u2014 including Demirtas and former co-chairwoman Figen Yuksekdag \u2014 on terror-related charges. \nThe arrests follow the collapse of a fragile peace process between the state and the PKK in 2015. The group is considered a terror organization by Turkey and its Western allies. \nYuksekdag lost her seat in parliament earlier this year after an appeals court confirmed her 2013 conviction for engaging in terrorist propaganda, and later stepped down as the HDP\u2019s co-leader.

Messenger Post Media \nCANANDAIGUA \u2014 The Canandaigua Chapter of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution has announced the selection of three local girls for the 2017 DAR Good Citizen Award. \nEmily Cook, from the Victor School District; Camille Sisto, from the Canandaigua School District; and Danielle Green, from the Honeoye District; were selected by school staff as award winners. \nThe qualities of a DAR Good Citizen are dependability (which includes truthfulness, loyalty and punctuality); service (which includes cooperation, courtesy and consideration of others); patriotism (which includes unselfish interest in family, school, community and nation). \nThe scholarship contest that helps determine the honor consists of two parts. \nIn the first part, the student describes how she has tried to manifest the qualities of a good citizen. Applicants list high school activities, how they have served the community, future plans, education, goals and aspirations in life. They also list extracurricular activities. \nFinally, they are to describe why the four qualities of a DAR Good Citizen are important and how they have exhibited those qualities in their lives and in their relationships with others. \nThe second part is a timed essay administered under the supervision of a faculty member. The theme this year was, \"Our American Heritage and Our Responsibility for Preserving It.\" The focus question was \"How has America advanced the cause of freedom in the rest of the world?\" \nThe three girls were awarded $100 scholarships on Nov. 8 at the Wood Library. They now also are eligible for state and national level awards. \nAbout the organization \nThe National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution is a nonprofit, charitable organization, founded in 1890. Membership is open to any woman 18 years and older who can trace her family's lineal descent from a patriot of the American Revolution. The DAR functions as a volunteer service organization and is dedicated to patriotism, education and historic preservation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emily cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "camille sisto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danielle green", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "messenger post media  canandaigua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canandaigua school district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victor school district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national society of the daughters of the american revolution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wood library", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "honeoye district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:05.087+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50d9b0f0e2578fad0b3b451825f4cba18e35d4c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUUC4XTyMkceuOVELklFmGAqMIiFgTT26acGQu6TWw7hNGCmguj77bNrbua2L5SHFK2FBJfx.tSCQzEPuUZOGvxHMegqIQF8aw--", "site_full": "www.expedia.com", "site": "expedia.com", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com/Auburn-Opelika-Hotels.d6057712.Travel-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Top 10 Auburn - Opelika Hotels in Alabama | Hotel Deals on Expedia", "title": "Quality", "title_full": "Quality Inn: 2017 Room Prices, Deals & Reviews | Expedia", "published": "2017-11-27T01:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.143, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 416, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "50d9b0f0e2578fad0b3b451825f4cba18e35d4c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUUC4XTyMkceuOVELklFmGAqMIiFgTT26acGQu6TWw7hNGCmguj77bNrbua2L5SHFK2FBJfx.tSCQzEPuUZOGvxHMegqIQF8aw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-27T01:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "Quality", "text": "Front desk inept.

We cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past. All challenges demand new approaches.\n\nMy announcement today marks the beginning of a new approach to conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. In 1995, Congress adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act urging the federal government to relocate the American embassy to Jerusalem and to recognize that that city \u2014 and so importantly \u2014 is Israel's capital.\n\nThis act passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority, and was reaffirmed by unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago. Yet for over 20 years, every previous American president has exercised the law's waiver, refusing to move the US embassy to Jerusalem or to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital city.\n\nPresidents issued these waivers under the belief that delaying the recognition of Jerusalem would advance the cause of peace. Some say they lacked courage, but they made their best judgments based on facts as they understood them at the time.\n\nNevertheless, the record is in. After more than two decades of waivers, we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result.\n\nTherefore, I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering.\n\nI've judged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. This is a long overdue step to advance the peace process and to work towards a lasting agreement.\n\nIsrael is a sovereign nation with the right, like every other sovereign nation, to determine its own capital. Acknowledging this as a fact is a necessary condition for achieving peace.\n\nIt was 70 years ago that the United States under President Truman recognized the state of Israel. Ever since then, Israel has made its capital in the city of Jerusalem, the capital the Jewish people established in ancient times.\n\nToday, Jerusalem is the seat of the modern Israeli government. It is the home of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, as well as the Israeli supreme court. It is the location of the official residence of the prime minister and the president. It is the headquarters of many government ministries. For decades, visiting American presidents, secretaries of state, and military leaders have met their Israeli counterparts in Jerusalem, as I did on my trip to Israel earlier this year.\n\nJerusalem is not just the heart of three great religions, but it is now also the heart of one of the most successful democracies in the world. Over the past seven decades, the Israeli people have built a country where Jews, Muslims, and Christians \u2014 and people of all faiths \u2014 are free to live and worship according to their conscience and according to their beliefs. Jerusalem is today \u2014 and must remain \u2014 a place where Jews pray at the Western Wall, where Christians walk the Stations of the Cross, and where Muslims worship at Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nHowever, through all of these years, presidents representing the United States have declined to officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. In fact, we have declined to acknowledge any Israeli capital at all. But today, we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel's capital. This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It's something that has to be done.\n\nThat is why, consistent with the Jerusalem Embassy Act, I am also directing the State Department to begin preparation to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This will immediately begin he process of hiring architects, engineers, and planners so that a new embassy, when completed, will be a magnificent tribute to peace.\n\nIn making these announcements, I also want to make one point very clear: This decision is not intended in any way to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement. We want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\n\nWe are not taking a position on any final status issues, including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem or the resolution of contested borders. Those questions are up to the parties involved. The United States remains deeply committed to helping facilitate a peace agreement that is acceptable to both sides. I intend to do everything in my power to help forge such an agreement.\n\nWithout question, Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive issues in those talks. The United States would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides. In the meantime, I call on all parties to maintain the status quo at Jerusalem's holy sites, including the Temple Mount, also known as Haram al-Sharif. Above all, our greatest hope is for peace \u2014 the universal yearning in every human soul.\n\nWith today's action, I reaffirm my administration's longstanding commitment to a future of peace and security for the region. There will, of course, be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement. But we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a peace and a place far greater in understanding and cooperation.\n\nThis sacred city should call forth the best in humanity \u2014 lifting our sights to what is possible, not pulling us back and down to the old fights that have become so totally predictable. Peace is never beyond the grasp of those willing to reach it. So today we call for calm, for moderation, and for the voices of tolerance to prevail over the purveyors of hate. Our children should inherit our love, not our conflicts.\n\nI repeat the message I delivered at the historic and extraordinary summit in Saudi Arabia earlier this year: The Middle East is a region rich with culture, spirit, and history. Its people are brilliant, proud, and diverse, vibrant and strong.\n\nBut the incredible future awaiting this region is held at bay by bloodshed, ignorance, and terror. Vice President Pence will travel to the region in the coming days to reaffirm our commitment to work with partners throughout the Middle East to defeat radicalism that threatens the hopes and dreams of future generations.\n\nIt is time for the many who desire peace to expel the extremists from their midsts. It is time for all civilized nations, and people, to respond to disagreement with reasoned debate, not violence. And it is time for young and moderate voices all across the Middle East to claim for themselves a bright and beautiful future.\n\nSo today, let us rededicate ourselves to a path of mutual understanding and respect. Let us rethink old assumptions and open our hearts and minds to possible and possibilities. And finally, I ask the leaders of the region \u2014 political and religious, Israeli and Palestinian, Jewish and Christian and Muslim \u2014 to join us in the noble quest for lasting peace.\n\nThank you, God bless you, God bless Israel, God bless the Palestinians, and God bless the United States.\n\nThank you very much.

While the agency has been working against the clock to help ever more people, the cash is quickly running out. \n\u201cWe\u2019re letting down those who need us most,\u201d said Claude Jibidar, WFP\u2019s Representative in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\u201d A tightly planned surge had made a big difference, Jibidar explained, but WFP had largely funded this from its own meagre resources. \u201cWithout immediate donor support, many \u2013 particularly women and children \u2013 will die.\u201d \nThe eruption of violence in what used to be a poor but peaceful region has claimed countless lives. Some 1.4 million people have been forced from their homes. Traditionally high malnutrition rates have sky-rocketed. \nWith 3.2 million people desperately short of food, WFP has stepped in with emergency assistance. A lull in fighting has allowed more staff to be deployed. Aid workers have fanned out into the Kasai countryside. WFP has co-ordinated multi-agency logistics and humanitarian flights. As a result, the number of people assisted has grown rapidly \u2013 from 42,000 in September to 115,000 in October and 225,000 in November. Last month, 13,500 children were given special fortified foods. \nBut donors\u2019 reluctance to commit to Kasai is jeopardizing this effort. While WFP plans to feed almost half a million people in December, so depleted are the agency\u2019s coffers that only half-rations can be distributed. \nHunger not only puts lives at risk: it forces people into prostitution and increases the risk of sexual violence, Jibidar stressed. \u201cGovernment partners must do all in their power to spare Kasai from the kind of decades-long humanitarian catastrophe that has plagued other DRC regions.\u201d \nWFP is the world's largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide, delivering food assistance in emergencies and working with communities to improve nutrition and build resilience.

Yep, it gets hot in there, even at the beginning of December. \nI should add that opening act Pseudo Echo raised the temperature a bit as well, with a surprisingly energetic set that had fans buzzing. Their 45 minutes on stage was just long enough to whip the crowd into a mild frenzy with hits like Send Me An Angel and Funky Town . Vocalist/guitarist Brian Canham even threw in a touch of AC/DC\u2019s Dirty Deeds at the end. Well played! \nThe Human League\u2019s sound is more keyboard based than guitar and this led to them sounding somewhat fey compared to the openers. \nThey began with Sky , a moody tune from their 2011 album Credo. Oakey hung back at the rear of the stage while vocalists Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall stood at the front on opposite sides. The band was filled out by a drummer and a couple of keyboard players who also played guitar occasionally. \nBut the fans didn\u2019t show up to hear songs from the 21 st century, they were there for a hit of 80s nostalgia and that began with Love Action (I Believe In Love). Phil Oakey\u2019s distinctive baritone voice remains strong although Susan and Joanne were sometimes difficult to hear in the mix. \nCredit to Oakey for refusing to age gracefully\u2026his outfit was classic bad taste eighties. \nUnfortunately, many of the lesser known songs featured in the mid portion of the show could be classified similarly. I admit to feeling like a quick nap as they churned through songs like Soundtrack To A Generation, Seconds and Tell Me When . The repetitive nature of those songs didn\u2019t help matters. \nBut the energy level came back up with 1983\u2019s Mirror Man , followed by (Keep Feeling) Fascination and the one tune everyone came to hear\u2026 Don\u2019t You Want Me . \nFor the encore, Oakey dipped back to the band\u2019s early days to play the dark Being Boiled , but sent everyone out on a high with his 1984 collaboration with Giorgio Moroder \u2026(Together In) Electric Dreams. \nIf The Human League had been kept to a 45 minute set, as their Australian friends had, I imagine their show would have felt more snappy and succinct.

The NATO allies are divided by a series of decades-old issues, including territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea, and have come to the brink of war three times since the early 1970s. \nBut from the outset, the discussions focused on disagreements. \nOn the eve of his visit, Erdogan rattled his Greek hosts by telling Greece's Skai television that the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne should be \"updated.\" The treaty delineated modern Turkey's borders and outlines the status of the Muslim minority in Greece and the Greek minority in Turkey, among other issues. \nIn a visibly testy first meeting with Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos, the two engaged in a thinly-veiled verbal spat over the treaty and Greece's Muslim minority, which Erdogan is to visit Friday. \n\"This happened in Lausanne, that happened in Lausanne. I get that, but let's now quickly do what is necessary,\" Erdogan told Pavlopoulos. \"Many things have changed in 94 years. If we review these, I believe that all the sides will agree that so many things have to (change.)\" \nThe spat continued during Erdogan's appearance at an unusually candid joint news conference with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. \nThe two listed a series of grievances their countries have with each other, including religious and minority rights, the divided island of Cyprus and the case of ten Turkish servicemen who have applied for asylum in Greece following a Turkish government crackdown after a failed coup last year. \n\"It is very important to strengthen our channels of communication, and this can only happen on the basis of mutual respect,\" Tsipras said. \nThe prime minister said the two also discussed tensions in the Aegean Sea, where Greece complains Turkish fighter jets frequently violate its airspace. \n\"The increasing violations of Greek airspace in the Aegean and particularly the simulated dogfights in the Aegean pose a threat to our relations, and particularly a threat to our pilots,\" Tsipras said. \nFor his part, Erdogan insisted once more that the Lausanne treaty needed to be reviewed, but stressed his country had no territorial claims on its smaller neighbor. \nOn the topic of the Muslim minority in Greece \u2014 which the country recognizes only as a religious minority, while Turkey has long pressed for better rights \u2014 Tsipras said his government agreed that improvements must be made in their quality of life. \n\"But issues that concern reforms involving Greek citizens are not an issue of negotiation between countries,\" he said. \nTsipras noted it was unclear exactly what Erdogan was seeking with his call to update the 1923 treaty. \n\"The truth is I am a little confused about what he is putting on the table,\" he said. \nGreeks have been aghast at Erdogan's previous comments over possibly revising the Lausanne treaty, fearing that could harbor territorial claims. \nErdogan and Tsipras also sparred over Cyprus, a Mediterranean island divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion into a Turkish-occupied north and an internationally recognized Greek Cypriot south. Another round of internationally-brokered peace talks to reunify the island failed earlier this year. \n\"Who left the table? Southern Cyprus did ... we want the issue to reach a fair and lasting solution but that is not southern Cyprus' concern,\" Erdogan said. \nTsipras retorted: \"My dear friend, Mr. President, we must not forget that this issue remains unresolved because 43 years ago there was an illegal invasion and occupation of the northern part of Cyprus.\" \nErdogan also raised the issue of Athens having no official mosque, to which Tsipras responded by saying Greece had restored several mosques around the country, including a centuries-old mosque in Athens. \nThe refugee crisis appeared to be the only issue the two sides did not disagree on, with both noting they had shared a significant burden of the migration flows into the European Union. More than a million people crossed from Turkey through Greece at the height of the crisis. \nLater Thursday, several hundred leftist, anarchist and Kurdish protesters held a peaceful march through Athens against Erdogan's visit. \nOn Friday, Erdogan will visit the northeastern town of Komotini to meet with members of Greece's Muslim minority. \n____ \nSuzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, Derek Gatopoulos and Nicholas Paphitis in Athens contributed. \n  Photos", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitris tzanakopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexis tsipras", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lausanne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:07.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f9e460cf16260a393e5db5a3cdc3831c5801a05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3Jp4jgBgGeyeHig8_xRatgpdiZRO7MoJwId19KRNtTAJCbWp9Tr1HwP_hcrovHZ9QtLwrug9JU5aH5.54A_eeBPPkU6LbXUjpw1Tx57tOfXX47rAlzVCXLSqZkxmkmUgMs7YUaUT3YcOQ--", "site_full": "eaworldview.com", "site": "eaworldview.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "TrumpWatch, Day 321: Flynn Promised End to Russia Sanctions - Whistle-Blower - EA WorldView", "title_full": "TrumpWatch, Day 321: Flynn Promised End to Russia Sanctions - Whistle-Blower - EA WorldView", "published": "2017-12-07T10:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.037, "main_image": "http://i1.wp.com/eaworldview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TRUMP-FLYNN-2.jpg?fit=710%2C473", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f9e460cf16260a393e5db5a3cdc3831c5801a05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3Jp4jgBgGeyeHig8_xRatgpdiZRO7MoJwId19KRNtTAJCbWp9Tr1HwP_hcrovHZ9QtLwrug9JU5aH5.54A_eeBPPkU6LbXUjpw1Tx57tOfXX47rAlzVCXLSqZkxmkmUgMs7YUaUT3YcOQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Lucas", "published": "2017-12-07T10:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "TrumpWatch, Day 321: Flynn Promised End to Russia Sanctions - Whistle-Blower - EA WorldView", "text": "Donald Trump with Michael Flynn during the 2016 campaign \n\u201cThis is going to make a lot of very wealthy people.\u201d \nDevelopments on Day 321 of the Trump Administration: \nSee also Podcasts: Trump\u2019s Jerusalem Mistake Did Flynn Promise Confirm Trump-Russia Cooperation Before Inauguration? \nEleven minutes after the inauguration of Donald Trump, Michael Flynn \u2014 senior Trump campaign advisor and then National Security Advisor in the new Administration \u2014 promised a former business associate that sanctions against Russia would soon be \u201cripped up\u201d, according to a whistle-blower who spoke with legislators. \nAs he sat behind Trump listening to the Inaugural Address, Flynn texted Alex Copson of ACU Strategic Partners, which hired Flynn in 2015 as an advisor for a plan to work with Russia to build nuclear power plants throughout the Middle East. The message was that the initiative could proceed with the removal of sanctions. \nListening to Trump, Copson told the whistle-blower, \u201cI couldn\u2019t be better. This is the best day of my life. This is the start of something I\u2019ve been working on for years, and we are good to go.\u201d \nCopson then showed the Flynn text to the whiste-blower, who noted the time of 12:11 pm, and said, \u201cMike has been putting everything in place for us\u2026.This is going to make a lot of very wealthy people.\u201d He explained that sanctions would be \u201cripped up\u201d in one of the Administration\u2019s first actions, saying Obama \u201cfucked everything up in my nuclear deal with the sanctions\u201d. \nThe whistle-blower\u2019s account is set out in a five-page letter by Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, to the committee\u2019s GOP chairman Trey Gowdy. \nRead the letter \nFlynn left as National Security Advisor after only 25 days, amid revelations about his conversations in December 2016 with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, including over additional sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama. Last week, he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. \nCourt records confirmed that the former Trump advisor is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation. They documented that senior Trump staff, notably Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, gave him guidance before the discussions with Kislyak. \nDespite the significance of the revelation, Gowdy indicated that the Oversight Committee will not follow up with the whistle-blower. Responding to Cummings by letter on Wednesday afternoon, Gowdy said that the claims \u201cfit squarely within\u201d Mueller\u2019s jurisdiction and that he had promised the Special Counsel that he would not interfere with his investigation. \nCummings maintained that Gowdy should subpoena the White House and the Flynn Intelligence Group, Flynn\u2019s former company, for documents that the House committee had requested in March but had not yet been provided. Cummings also said that Gowdy should subpoena Flynn, Copson, and four others to testify. Trump Jr. Wrongly Invokes Attorney-Client Privilege to Avoid Answers to Congressional Committee \nDonald Trump Jr. wrongly invokes attorney-client privilege to avoid answering questions in an eight-hour session with the House Intelligence Committee. \nA Democratic member of the committee, Rep. Jackie Speier, summarized : \nMy takeaway is he has a very serious case of amnesia. \nHe was pretty non-responsive on a lot of issues that, frankly, you would have a recollection of, considering it was just a year ago that many of these events took place when Donald Trump was the candidate. He was by his father\u2019s side; he was campaigning with his father. And you get the impression in listening to him that he didn\u2019t spend much time talking to his father. \nSpeier added, \u201cLots of people don\u2019t recall things. But, I would say that there are elements of this where he was very clear and knew precisely what had happened, and then other circumstances he didn\u2019t at all.\u201d \nCommittee Democrats focused on Trump Jr.\u2019s June 2016 meeting \u2014 alongside Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign manager Paul Manfort \u2014 with three Kremlin-linked envoys about the possible provision of material damaging Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. \nAt one point, the legislators asked about Trump Jr.\u2019s first, misleading response about the meeting when it was revealed by The New York Times in July 2017. Multiple media reports indicate that Donald Trump Sr. shaped the false response. \nDemocratic Rep. Eric Swalwell said Trump Jr. invoked attorney-client privilege and \u201crefused to share anything\u201d about what he and his father discussed about the statement. Trump Jr. did tell the committee that he engaged in a back-and-forth about the wording of the statement with communications director Hope Hicks, according to \u201ca committee source\u201d. \nThe committee also asked about Trump Jr.\u2019s correspondence with WikiLeaks, which disseminated e-mails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s advisors \u2014 after they were provided by Russian operatives through third parties, according to US intelligence services \u2014 in autumn 2016. \nSpeier said: \nI think the overriding issue here is, why does every road lead to Russia? \nEvery business deal, every engagement. The engagement with WikiLeaks was all quite opaque in terms of how it all started, why [Trump Jr.] was able to direct-message with [WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange]. So, there\u2019s still a lot of pieces to this puzzle that we don\u2019t have the answers to. \nSwalwell said the Democrats plan to present Republican counterparts with legal arguments for why attorney-client privilege \u201cdoesn\u2019t apply\u201d just because lawyers were present for the conversations in question. \nHowever, Swalwell said, \u201cIt\u2019s up to the Republicans whether or not to call him back.\u201d 58 Democrats Vote For Impeachment Proceedings v. Trump \nAlmost 60 Democrats, an unexpectedly high number, support an effort to launch impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump. \nThe resolution from Rep. Al Green of Texas was set aside 364-58. All Republicans voted with 126 Democrats to defeat the resolution. \nThose Democrats included Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who announced ahead of the vote they would vote to table the effort. They cited ongoing investigations by congressional committees and the Special Counsel Robert Mueller. \nGreen\u2019s articles of impeachment said Trump has \u201cbrought disrepute, contempt, ridicule and disgrace on the Presidency\u201d and \u201csown discord among the people of the United States\u201d. They cited Trump\u2019s response to white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia in August and his attacks on National Football League players kneeling during the national anthem to raise social issues. Veterans Administration Ends Program for Homeless Vets \nFour days after Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin used a prominent Washington event to promote the Trump administration\u2019s promise to house all homeless vets, the Veterans Administration pulls resources from a major housing program. \nThe VA said it is ending a $460 million program that has dramatically reduced homelessness among chronically sick and vulnerable veterans. The money will go to local VA hospitals that can use it as they like, as long as they show evidence of dealing with homelessness. \nThe move came as an annual survey showed a 1.5% increase in veteran homelessness this year \u2014 the first rise since 2010. Most of the jump occurred in Los Angeles, where housing costs are rising sharply. \nAccording to Government data, there were almost 40,000 homeless veterans in 2016, and even those with housing still need assistance. The program slashed by the VA had reduced the number of displaced servicemembers, serving 138,000 since 2010 and cutting the number without housing on a given day by almost half. More than half the veterans housed are chronically ill, mentally ill, or have substance abuse problems. \nShulkin insisted on Wednesday that overall funding for veteran homelessness was not being cut, but suggested he might reconsider the decision as he promised to get input from local VA leaders and others \u201con how best to target our funding to the geographical areas that need it most\u201d. GOP Legislators Make It Easier to Carry Guns Across State Lines \nRepublicans push a bill through the House of Representatives that will make it easier for gun owners to legally carry concealed weapons across state lines. \nThe House approved the bill 231-198, largely along party lines. The legislation now goes to the Senate for consideration. \nThe measure is the first significant action on guns in Congress since mass shootings in Nevada and Texas killed more than 80 people in October and November. \nRepublicans said the reciprocity measure, a top priority of the National Rifle Association, means gun owners can travel freely between states without worrying about conflicting state laws or civil suits.

Business leaders warn further delays will hurt companies as they plan for the future. \nIreland\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said late Wednesday that he hopes May will submit a new offer \u201ctonight or tomorrow.\u201d Disagreements over rules governing the border between the Republic of Ireland, which is a member of the EU, and the U.K. province of Northern Ireland derailed an earlier proposal. \nExisting rules allow people and goods to pass freely between the Republic and Northern Ireland with no border checks. Ireland wants to preserve the current arrangement, which has eased tensions along the border. May is struggling to balance those demands against the concerns of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to support her government in Parliament. \nVaradkar said Wednesday that avoiding a hard border remains his \u201cabsolute red line.\u201d \n\u201cWe will not loosen our position,\u201d he told Ireland\u2019s Parliament, the Dail. \u201cWe will stay very firm.\u201d \nThe British and Irish prime ministers discussed the Brexit impasse in a phone call Wednesday, but there was no sign of an imminent breakthrough. \nMay\u2019s office said she and Varadkar are \u201cworking hard to find a specific solution to the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland,\u201d which have triggered a crisis in Britain\u2019s divorce negotiations. \nIn Brussels, the EU\u2019s executive Commission is talking with the British government to organize a visit by May by Sunday. \n\u201cWe here in the commission are still in discussions with London and the whole EU 27, notably with Dublin. So far, no white smoke,\u201d said EU Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas. \nHe rejected British media speculation that May could be given until next week to demonstrate \u201csufficient progress\u201d on the three key issues of the Brexit divorce. \n\u201cWe stand ready to receive Prime Minister May at any moment in time when they are ready,\u201d Schinas said, but warned: \u201cThis will have to have to happen this week.\u201d \n\u201cEvery day lost makes this more difficult,\u201d he said.

Upland Resources Limited   383.17M   758,307   1.15 and high of 1.68. FTSE 100 Index: Driving The U.K. \nThe Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index (FTSE 100 Index) or FTSE 100 for short, is the benchmark index of the top 100 largest and most liquid stocks on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). As such, the index is market capitalization-weighted and free-float adjusted. FTSE 100 is operated by FTSE Group, a unit of London Stock Exchange Group. \nA large component of the index is made up of foreign companies listed on LSE. So while the index tracks the LSE\u2019s blue-chip stocks, it is considered a weak representation of the U.K.\u2019s economy because of its large foreign constituency. \nFor investors interested in tracking the health of the U.K. economy, the FTSE 250 is a better guide because it is dominated by domestic U.K. companies. \nComponents of FTSE 100 make up more than 80% of LSE\u2019s entire market capitalization and that partly explains why it is a widely used gauge of the U.K.\u2019s stock market. However, a more comprehensive indicator is the FTSE All-Share Index, which is broader as it aggregates FTSE 100, FTSE 250 and other small-cap stocks on the LSE. Rebalancing of the index \nThe FTSE 100 is reshuffled quarterly. The Rebalancing of the index takes into account the changes in the market capitalization of its constituents such as after a rights issue or a large debt-to-equity swap. Components of FTSE 100 represent a variety of sectors in the U.K. economy such as Financials, Industrials, Technology and Energy. Upland Resources Limited is a stock traded on the U.K\u2019s stock exchange. Historic marks \nFTSE 100 Index dipped to a lifetime low of 427.50 points in February 1978, but steadily recovered from the trough. The index notched a lifetime high of 7103.98 points in April 2015 amid speculation that the Conservative Part would win the U.K. general election in May of the same year. The index\u2019s earlier record high was reached in 1999 during the so-called dot-com bubble. Upland Resources Limited has relatively good liquidity. The stock market \nThe LSE is the main stock exchange in the U.K. and one of the largest in the world. The exchange was established in 1801, making it one of the world\u2019s oldest stock markets. The LSE is also a platform for companies to raise capital for expansion. \nThe exchange has an SME focused platform called the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). It also operates the Depository Receipt (DR) platform for trading shares of foreign companies based outside the European Union. \nA variety of securities are traded on LSE. These include equities, bonds, ETFs and a broad line of other derivatives. Opening hours \nThe LSE platform opens for trading at 8 a.m. and closes at 4 p.m. But there are pre-market and post-market sessions that open early and close late. The exchange operates all weekday except on holidays declared in advance. The market is closed on weekends. \nThe LSE is owned by the London Stock Exchange Group, which also owns several other exchanges across Europe and the FTSE 100 Index. U.K. stocks drawing more investors \nThough Brexit has shaken several businesses and economies in the Eurozone and beyond, U.K. companies continue to see investor interest in their stocks thanks in part to the country\u2019s strong regulations and corporate transparency. \nProspects of the U.K. avoiding hard Brexit are also strengthening retail investor hopes that the country\u2019s economy would escape recession after it leaves the European Union. Professional analysts might be interested how this will affect Upland Resources Limited. \nAnother recent and important Upland Resources Limited (LON:UPL) news was published by Worldoil.com which published an article titled: \u201cUpland Resources announces farm-in agreement with Corallian Energy in the UK\u201d on November 30, 2017. \nUpland Resources Limited is a principal investment firm specializing in farm-ins and applications for open acreage.   4.83 million GBP. The firm seeks to invest in the gas and oil exploration and production sectors. It currently has negative earnings.

This feature can be enabled when you select weather alerts under the \u201cMy Alerts\u201d section of your Alert Loudoun profile. Weather Alerts Are Automatically Sent By Phone A feature of the Alert Loudoun system is voice calling, which is used to communicate automated weathers alerts to subscribers who provide mobile, home and/or work voice numbers.

Also, though we strongly encourage subscribers to provide voice numbers, you can visit your profile and remove voice numbers.

How can I maximize the weather alerts in Alert Loudoun? A. With the Alert Loudoun system, by providing a physical address with your account, you can customize and receive weather alerts targeted for that address. In addition, you may register for alerts affecting your home, workplace, children\u2019s schools, and more. Q. Why is there a confirmation option with Alert Loudoun messages? A. The confirmation option lets the system know that you have received the message. Once you confirm receipt of the message, the system stops trying to deliver the messages through the other methods or devices you have selected for your account. For example, the email alert asks you to acknowledge receipt through a link; a text alert to your cell phone asks you to reply \"Yes and send;\" while the mobile app (see below) gives you the option to press \"Confirm.\" Q. I signed up to receive alerts as text messages on my cell phone but am not receiving the texts. Any idea why I am not receiving text message alerts? A. Your phone or service provider may be \u201cblocking\u201d these alerts. All Alert Loudoun SMS text messages come from the Everbridge SMS short code number #89361 or #87844. What you'll need to do is call your cell phone carrier to confirm that they are not blocking the Everbridge SMS short code (#89361 or #87844) on your device. For most major carriers, dialing 611 from the device will get you to their service to ask about short code blocking. Other causes of this issue include: Not adding Everbridge to the list of 9999 unblock/block Sprint Commands (for Sprint customers only); and content downloads, such as paid game/ringtone downloads being blocked (they should be unblocked) Q. What is the best web browser to use with Alert Loudoun? A. The best Internet browser to use with Alert Loudoun/Everbridge is Google Chrome. The Everbridge platform also supports Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer 11+ and Edge. Q. Is there an app for Alert Loudoun? A. Yes. You can download the Everbridge app for your smartphone. Search for the Everbridge app on the Apple Store or Google Play store. (Everbridge is the company whose software is used to send our alerts.) Q. I live in Loudoun, but work in Fairfax. How can I sign up for another jurisdiction\u2019s alerts? A. Go to www.Capitalert.gov for links to the alert systems for area jurisdictions. Q. Will my contact information be shared with others? A. No. The information that you provide will be used only for notification purposes. We will not give or sell your contact or location information to any vendor or other organization. Q.

This isn\u2019t surprising, drawing to the end of what has undoubtedly been \u201ctheir year\u201d, in which they have released four studio albums to massive coverage (with a fifth planned before the month is through.) \nAlong for the ride were two Californian groups; Mild High Club, who collaborated with the headliners this year on their album Sketches Of Brunswick East , and surf-rockers La Luz. I\u2019ll say from the beginning that all three bands were fantastic last night, making for one of the best live musical experiences I\u2019ve had this year. \nLa Luz opened the night at 8:45, matching the heat of the gradually filling venue with a set of tropical surf rock. The four-piece layered sunny surf guitars, 60\u2019s-inspired organ and bouncy rockabilly rhythms for a little over half an hour, and I would have been happy to watch more. Drummer Marian Li-Pino particularly stood out as an exemplary musician to watch, delivering surf rhythms with a jazz-infused approach. Their music, tropical and humid, has a slightly spooky edge, self described as \u201csurf noir\u201d. \nUp next were Mild High Club. Like La Luz before them their music was a perfect match for the summer heat, though they took a more mellow approach with woozy washed-out guitars, lounge-jazz keyboards and of course lots of reverb. Opening with a handful of tracks from their debut album, they then proceeded to play the first five cuts from 2016\u2019s follow-up Skiptracing in order, starting with the drum machine-lead lazy psych of the title track. The best moments were those that showed their jazz influences the clearest, the five-piece swapping instruments as they layered multiple guitars and synthesizers over some sublime drumming (turns out great drummers were kind of a theme this night). \nThe headliners finally took the stage at around 10:40. Spaces can clearly be deceiving \u2013 on previous occasions when I\u2019ve seen solo acts at Whammy Bar the performance space has seemed tiny, but last night it easily fit all seven members of King Gizzard, including two drummers with a drum kit each, though the bassist and one of three guitarists ended up partially hidden towards the back of the low-lit stage. \nThey played full-throttle from track one, opening with the breakneck People Vultures , the front row shouting every word. Most of the set after that leant heavily on this year\u2019s Murder Of The Universe , with some of the spoken word segments cued over the speakers. \nThe music rarely stops at a King Gizzard gig, the group changing from one song to the next while rarely stopping the beat. For someone not familiar with all of their material, it can be hard to know where one song ends and another begins, which is a good thing in the context of this band, allowing one to focus on the driving rhythms and relentless energy. \nCellophane , from 2014\u2019s I\u2019m In Your Mind Fuzz , was the only pre-2016 cut played, and one of many highlights due to multi-instrumentalist Ambrose Kenny-Smith\u2019s wailing harmonica. More mosh-friendly fan favourites came with Robot Stop and Gamma Knife , followed by a reprise of the set\u2019s opening track People Vultures . This was just one example of the band constantly recycling musical motifs, blending tracks from across their recent discography into one continuous musical trip. The set closed with a run of tracks from their first album of the year, Flying Microtonal Banana , starting with the groove of Nuclear Fusion (a nice quiet moment only by comparison) and closing with the sustained bounce of single Rattlesnake . \nThe musicianship of the group is truly something to behold. The two drummers, their kits facing each other, played with almost unbelievable accuracy together, churning out relentlessly fast rock\u2019n\u2019roll beats in absolute unison, even perfectly coordinating each fill and drum roll. When they did diverge it was to great effect as well, trading on and off beats on the hi hats in Nuclear Fusion . The whole group navigated solidly through constant time signature changes and beat skips and jumps, keeping the music constantly evolving while still maintaining the musical repetition and similarity that gives their live set a kind of circular, continuous flow. \nWhat\u2019s more, I\u2019ve never seen or even dreamt of a band being able to sustain such a high level of energy continuously for as long as King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard and keep the crowd engaged and energised for the entire set without ever growing stale for want of variation. I\u2019ve always believed a gig needs a good contrast of energetic highs and lows, but this band somehow proved the exception, by using the talent of all seven members to construct a constant yet ever-changing musical set that taps into some place of primal energetic satisfaction. \nI\u2019m going back on Saturday, when it will be interesting to see if they have the same level of energy on their fourth consecutive appearance at the same venue. Somehow I don\u2019t doubt it though. \nRuben Mita. \nClick on any image to view a photo gallery by Veronica McLaughlin: \nLa Luz setlist \u2013", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "la luz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ambrose kenny-smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruben mita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "veronica mclaughlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marian li-pino", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "whammy bar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king gizzard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mild high club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "people vultures", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gamma knife", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brunswick east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laneway", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:09.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c8b4883f39b86aa806a31f1275979d3eca4e845", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED8Ax9yxcwZ2Y4_7rdjai3WGO2qf9ORAsu2Dhu0AQCzFyTEYYI.XLQodnRlIQ0d7y8.Brzscnt0LTNn6r0BtDC2ogzP0cUIJ4gYvdUisDZMoHBBfxB75wkqibu7NyySM42Qh2TiDHfBs8xK5p0_VB.fPhB2L8okwwOk-", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/geek/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Geek links", "title": "(9829287) The world is an awful cesspool so let's discuss how cool these new Lego Batman minifigures are instead", "title_full": "FARK.com: (9829287) The world is an awful cesspool so let's discuss how cool these new Lego Batman minifigures are instead", "published": "2017-12-07T06:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img.fark.net/images/cache/orig/r/rE/fark_rE4oA1YErXADWgE2RNiFnHfclwE.jpg?t=tRhL16vbEz6ongFA3MNVNA&amp;f=1512968400", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3382, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d6b511853e606664fe6627eb5369adebc99d180f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqIBRdCDNqED8Ax9yxcwZ2Y4_7rdjai3WGO2qf9ORAsu2Dhu0AQCzFyTEYYI.XLQodnRlIQ0d7y8.Brzscnt0LTNn6r0BtDC2ogzP0cUIJ4gYvdUisDZMoHBBfxB75wkqibu7NyySM42Qh2TiDHfBs8xK5p0_VB.fPfADHplOD5tNWVxttjwAekg--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Smashed Hat", "published": "2017-12-07T11:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Ashyukun : Yeah, sorry- I wholeheartedly disagree.

In addition, the correction function such as adding a brush function to the partial correction tool has been enhanced. This product is RAW development software for professional. Full Basic Functions SILKYPIX allows you to make adjustments such as exposure (brightness), white balance (shading), tone (light and dark sharpness) while maintaining a high quality of image without deteriorating the image. In addition, anyone can easily perform high-quality adjustments because basic adjustments are arranged in order from the top of the control panel. Furthermore, fine tuning adjustments for each item can be minutely performed with the \"Slider\" control.\nA Variety of Functions to Recreate the Photographer\u2019s Images The Partial correction function is included to adjust saturation and brightness of specified areas. In addition, the newly adopted Brush in SILKYPIX Pro8 can be used to designate areas for partial correction more freely than ever. What is more, a variety of fine adjustment functions such as Fine color controller which can be used to adjust each specific color and Highlight controller which restores colors in highlighted parts as well as recover gradation are available. \nEasy Editing with Tastes SILKYPIX Pro8 has 10 types of maker tastes installed which can take on various shooting scenes in advance. Just by choosing a taste such as \"Landscape\" or \"Portrait,\" you can make a finished photograph easily that fits your image. In addition, you can save your adjusted parameters as a taste. Parameters are very useful functions, and you can easily create pictures from the same image by applying them to other photographs. \nCompliable with JPEG and TIFF With \"SILKYPIX RAW Bridge\" available only on SILKYPIX Pro8, JPEGs and TIFFs are expanded to 16 bits, so even JPEG and TIFF images can be adjusted to a high degree of image quality with less image degradation. \nNew Features in Version 8.0: \nClarity adjustment A \u201cClarity\u201d parameter has been added to the \u201cTone\u201d adjustment item to adjust the luminance level of each pixel based on information from surrounding pixels. Increasing the effects of \u201cClarity\u201d will make it possible to finish the details of the subject in a bold picture, so it is effective when you want to finish bold scenes with a hazy surrounding. In contrast, by lowering the \u201cClarity\u201d you can finish with a soft ambience like with a soft focus, so you can use it to effect with women and children\u2019s photography. \nA Brush added to the Partial correction tools A \u201cBrush\u201d that makes it possible to select correction areas more freely to \u201cPartial corrections\u201d was added in \u201cSILKYPIX Developer Studio Pro7.\u201d Using the \u201cBrush\u201d makes corrections easier even in difficult areas of \u201ccircular correction filter\u201d and \u201cgradual correction filter.\u201d More creative adjustments have become possible by making partial corrections that do not take the form of the subject. \nStrengthening the Monochrome Controller Function A Monochrome Controller function has been installed specialized for adjusting monochrome pictures. Eight kinds of \u201cColor filters\u201d can be selected, and it is possible to reproduce filters when shooting monochrome photographs on your screen. In addition, since the \u201cLightness\u201d can be adjusted for each hue, you can make a thorough finish to your black and white photographs. Even beginners of black and white photography can easily switch between color and monochrome images after applying parameters in the preview display, so you will be able to intensify the understanding of effects on monochrome photographs due to changes in color. \nUnderwater Photo Controller Installed as a Function for Correcting Dedicated to Underwater PhotographyA function from \u201cSILKYPIX Marine Photography\u201d for RAW development software dedicated to underwater photography has been installed into \u201cSILKYPIX Developer Studio Pro8\u201d called Underwater photo controller. With this Underwater photo controller, you can correct the bluishness that is difficult to adjust with the normal white balance by using \u201cWhite balance for underwater.\u201d It also features \u201cColor restoration,\u201d which actually reproduces colors lost in water, as well as \u201cMuddy reduction\u201d to eliminate murkiness in water. \nFocus Peaking Function Installed A Focus peaking function has been installed to detect the parts focused on from adjacent pixels in the image, and to display them with colors added to those parts. With this function, you can clearly check the area of focus. \nImproved User Interface We have improved the design to be clean and simple to make it possible to concentrate on adjusting images. In addition, the layout has been changed to make it easier to understand for those using adjustment functions for the first time. Also, you can now change the background color of the preview display according to your preference. \nRELEASE NOTES:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:09.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "57ad8bfbcacd349d0b7aaa3f4ae17ea8e48efe40", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6aoitnkY7ao1AllybxsJqvBXkoO7RCc5z_nom1y82.xVBqkIhkjIb5fU7D6TpmkabAP67BM.Anz46eX8fX5Ui04uj5M0_Ab3vJU5Jfi9HS9YuxMZ4i5drmD2l3b39TsA-", "site_full": "www.reviewcentre.com", "site": "reviewcentre.com", "site_section": "https://www.reviewcentre.com/Postal-and-Delivery-Services/Montway-Auto-Transport-www-montway-com-reviews_1477166", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "computer_reviews", "tech"], "section_title": "Montway Auto Transport Reviews - www.montway.com | Postal &amp; Delivery Services | Review Centre", "title": "Expert Logistics Delivery Delivered on time", "title_full": "Expert Logistics Delivery Review | Delivered on time", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.046, "main_image": "https://assets.reviewcentre.com/cms//images/175/837/6/Expert-Logistics-Delivery-jpg-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 37825, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "57ad8bfbcacd349d0b7aaa3f4ae17ea8e48efe40", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6aoitnkY7ao1AllybxsJqvBXkoO7RCc5z_nom1y82.xVBqkIhkjIb5fU7D6TpmkabAP67BM.Anz46eX8fX5Ui04uj5M0_Ab3vJU5Jfi9HS9YuxMZ4i5drmD2l3b39TsA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lambxf185", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Expert Logistics Delivery Delivered on time", "text": "Delivered on time by very polite driver.

Oh well...guess it will be a water block if I want it cooler.\n#11", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [],
