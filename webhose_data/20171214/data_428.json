We present the first study addressing molecular effects of fractional non-sequential ultrapulsed CO 2 laser treatment using a 3D skin model that allows standardized investigations of time-dependent molecular changes ex vivo. While histological examination was performed to assess morphological changes, we utilized gene expression profiling using microarray and qRT-PCR analyses to identify molecular effects of laser treatment. Irradiated models exhibited dose-dependent morphological changes resulting in an almost complete recovery of the epidermis 5 days after irradiation. On day 5 after laser injury with a laser fluence of 100 mJ/cm 2 , gene array analysis identified an upregulation of genes associated with tissue remodeling and wound healing (e.g., COL12A1 and FGF7), genes that are involved in the immune response (e.g., CXCL12 and CCL8) as well as members of the heat shock protein family (e.g., HSPB3). On the other hand, we detected a downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP3), differentiation markers (e.g., LOR and S100A7), and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1\u03b1.\nOverall, our findings substantiate the understanding of time-dependent molecular changes after CO 2 laser treatment. The utilized 3D skin model system proved to be a reliable, accurate, and reproducible tool to explore the effects of various laser settings both on skin morphology and gene expression during wound healing.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AzlrSw", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "co", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:32.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "75b1912f30ff177f9dc2b2ef57a97583c76ba136", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gT.AZYqr_NjceKVtiTYjZ94-", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/1011639/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Guild Recruitment - World of Warcraft Forums", "title": "933 DK looking for TANK spot in progression", "title_full": "933 DK looking for TANK spot in progression - World of Warcraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T17:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/wow.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0bfb99034519e9406fdbffbd68996a83d0b646de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gT.AZYqr_Njc.6ZWnc1zOk5xlxDoOyVOTQ--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Dieslowly", "published": "2017-12-07T17:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "(H) veracity is 11/11N in Antorus and looking for more to fill out our roster.\nveracity is lead by mythic raiders from previous raid tiers and expansions.

Meet Robina Kolok, a supply officer from South Sudan on assignment to Bangladesh. Robina Kolok, Associate Supply Officer, temporarily assigned to Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, from Kenya.\u00a9 UNHCR/Mitra Salima Suryono 07 December 2017 | Fran\u00e7ais \nName: Robina Kolok, 35, from South Sudan. Job titl e: Associate Supply Officer, temporarily assigned to Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, from her duty station in Kenya. Years at UNHCR: Seven, working in South Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya. Why did you become an aid worker? I think I was destined to work with refugees. I was an urban refugee in Kenya, having left South Sudan when I was very young. I was a UNHCR beneficiary \u2013 UNHCR sponsored my primary education. I got to know about UNHCR at an early age. In addition to that, my mother later joined the World Food Programme in South Sudan. When I went to visit her at work, she would be involved in programmes like food distribution. Seeing people receive the food aid, and how they appreciated what they were receiving, made me want to do what she was doing. I saw the sense of satisfaction she got from her job. It motivated me to follow in her footsteps. What is the most rewarding/challenging thing about your job? In just three months, more than 600,000 Rohingya refugees have fled violence in Myanmar to seek safety in Bangladesh. What is shocking to me about this emergency is how fast it has been growing. While it is growing very fast, the resources are not keeping up. We are giving a lot, yet it feels like a drop in the ocean. Logistically, it means more work for us at our warehouse, because we are bagging up various aid items like jerry cans, plastic sheets, blankets, mosquito nets, cooking pots and solar lanterns. But when it comes to distribution, it is easier. In the camps, refugees have to walk long distances to pick up aid items. So having the items already in kit form makes it easier for them to carry. Robina at work in the UNHCR warehouse in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. \u00a9 UNHCR The job needs you to be strong, and have an authoritative voice. You are dealing with people, mainly men, from different backgrounds \u2013 from labourers to loaders, truck drivers, to managers. You need to have all these characteristics, which I think women have. What was the best day you had at work? I had just started my career in the United Nations when we were involved in the repatriation of refugees from Uganda to South Sudan. When I saw them return, they had that feeling of coming home. They had possessions that they brought back with them, and they were so happy to be back in their own land. We were not doing much for them \u2013 we were distributing tools and seedlings \u2013 but what I saw in their faces was a hope for a new and better tomorrow. That was the best day of my life. Especially for myself, coming from the same community, it felt like things were changing for the better. What was the worst day at work? Actually, it is related to what I said is the best day of my career. It was when I saw that hope begin to crumble in late 2013, when fighting broke out in South Sudan again. I happened to drive along the road exiting town, and there were all these families walking with mattresses on their heads, buckets, all their belongings \u2013 leaving South Sudan, trying to cross the border into Uganda. It was just a few years before that they were coming back home, and now they were leaving their home again. That was painful for me.

Last Tuesday to this past Monday will likely go down as one of the worst weeks in the entire Giants franchise, and it should. A bad joke of a head coach, in the middle of a garbage year, pointlessly tanks a franchise legend\u2019s record for pretty much nothing, and the entire fanbase turned on the team to the point where it\u2019ll likely be years before a lot of us feel any reason to trust the Giants again. I\u2019ve always made fun of the Giants from a place of love, but this past week it came from a place of hate. It was weird. I don\u2019t want to hate them, but I kinda do. \nI don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m happy about the firings. I\u2019m glad Jerry Reese got canned, because I was afraid he was going to get Ben to take the fall like he managed with Coughlin, so that at least gave me slight hope. \nBut firing them on Monday? It\u2019s too late, Mara. You already committed to the mistake. Now you\u2019re just undoing what flimsy justification you still had left! If you are going to tank Eli\u2019s streak, to insult him and the fanbase for the sake of looking at the future QB situation, at least fucking commit. With the streak dead and the damage done, going back to Eli feels\u2026pointless. It\u2019s too late. You knocked over the card tower, don\u2019t rebuild it, you can\u2019t. See what the other deck has. At this stage the only game Eli should really start is the last week, so he can get an appropriate sendoff in case it\u2019s his final game as a Giant. Now Geno\u2019s chance to do something is ruined, Davis Webb\u2019s chance to show something is ruined, all for nothing. Eli\u2019s streak ended for nothing. Nothing. I don\u2019t consider the firings worth it, because they would have likely happened anyway, and they only happened this soon because of how badly this whole thing got handled. \nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, Eli\u2019s streak should count till his actual first non-start due to injury or legitimate benching. It won\u2019t go into the record books, but it should be considered as such. Rivers is now the Iron Man and he should pass Eli in the early 2019 season. I expect him to get it. I\u2019ll be happy for him when he does, because he will deserve it. I\u2019ll just be sad that the record he broke ended in such insulting fashion. \nMara\u2019s been pulling out the PR talk all week, and he\u2019s pretty good at it honestly. I can see why it was so easy to buy into his BS before this, he\u2019s pretty smooth. This as just such a big dent he can\u2019t quite buff it all out this time. Claiming he \u201cnever expected Eli to react the way he did\u201d, or \u201cthat the plan was to let Eli stay in until the game was well out of hand and then Ben took that into a terrible direction\u201d. He\u2019s claiming a bunch of stuff that is just plausible enough that it could very well be true, and I\u2019d be willing to believe if this hadn\u2019t been such a blow to any trust the franchise had. \nFor one thing, he had roughly 4-5 days to prevent this shit. The news broke Tuesday and the outrage was immediate and loud. There was ample time to step in and curb McAdoo\u2019s decision. But he didn\u2019t. I think it\u2019s because he straight up knew exactly what the plan was. I think they were all totally on board with this nonsense, made the decision expecting blowback, telling themselves \u201cwe made the hard choice\u201d, then stuck with it. But the outrage was greater than expected and threatened their wallets. This wasn\u2019t grumbly fans, this was calls of protest and sheer disgust on levels I haven\u2019t seen Giants fans reach before. I think Mara waited to see if Geno would actually play well, because if he did and the Giants won, they could claim it was the right move and stick with it. But it obviously didn\u2019t work, and Mara realized this was only going to get worse, so he cut his losses and hit the reset button. Now the team will limp to the finish line without any reason for us to care. At least before this we had Eli\u2019s streak to be proud of. Now I just feel bad for Eli. What does he even have left to play for here? If I was him I would ask for a release at the end of this season. \nMcAdoo might find another job someday, probably as a position coach like Tomsula or something. He was always in way over his head. Reese\u2026I won\u2019t deny to be happy to see him gone but he did play his part in two Super Bowls. He was garbage at drafting past round 2 and only did anything in free agency when his job was threatened, but there are worse GMs and his 2007 class and 2010-2011 free agent acquisitions did help propel the Giants to a couple of championships. But during his tenure the Giants never really felt like a true championship contender outside 2008. The two wins are largely viewed as flukes or underdog stories by the public at large. That\u2019s partially on him. The team was clearly good enough to win it all, but they never actually felt like it except the one year that got tanked when Plax shot himself. He just sucked at finding depth and building a complete team. He was with the organization for 20 years. The tenure ended poorly, but I think he deserves a friendly wave on the way out. \nI\u2019m done giving a shit about the team this year. I have no reason to care until week 17 when Eli gets a send off. I don\u2019t know who we\u2019ll get as GM or coach and I\u2019ll worry about it when it counts. We\u2019ll probably fuck it up.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ben mcadoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iron man", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coughlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tomsula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry reese", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plax", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis webb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcadoo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "giants", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:32.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "39647232aac58319d0b37b6fd7e5f65daa85a2e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_9XNWKvROtZQ4qzx33HrsnRo_jS8SqVDntL9X4ANDuneHK.OrzxEe.PIgtYiHIMg5z7eavtptPM1hLAN.WGpVwOEmmJ6RuIqAtvACiG7Y8VSmsHvhMR9mdNyTttkY8JY7C2o0PqrL084UOqzQvWly9J09LDImxnz4dg9Lu8CNYIa2.8Iay28Fi2ip4Q4CgANo-", "site_full": "www.oxfordmail.co.uk", "site": "oxfordmail.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/sport/rss/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Oxford Mail | Sport", "title": "VARSITY MATCH: Sophie Trott fully focused on helping Oxford University defend their title at Twickenham", "title_full": "VARSITY MATCH: Sophie Trott fully focused on helping Oxford University defend their title at Twickenham", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/resources/images/7150067/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 88840, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "39647232aac58319d0b37b6fd7e5f65daa85a2e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_9XNWKvROtZQ4qzx33HrsnRo_jS8SqVDntL9X4ANDuneHK.OrzxEe.PIgtYiHIMg5z7eavtptPM1hLAN.WGpVwOEmmJ6RuIqAtvACiG7Y8VSmsHvhMR9mdNyTttkY8JY7C2o0PqrL084UOqzQvWly9J09LDImxnz4dg9Lu8CNYIa2.8Iay28Fi2ip4Q4CgANo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "VARSITY MATCH: Sophie Trott fully focused on helping Oxford University defend their title at Twickenham", "text": "VARSITY MATCH: Sophie Trott fully focused on helping Oxford University defend their title at Twickenham Jack Johnson @OxMailJackJ Sports reporter covering rugby and athletics.

I\u2019ve tried making my own a few times but was always discouraged by the long list of ingredients I could never find and the hours spent cooking it. I have finally developed a version that can be made in under 30 minutes with only a few simple ingredients that you may already have in your kitchen. If you like the classic Chinese soup but never have time to make it, you are going to love this version. 30 Minutes or Less \nCreating soup recipes that can be made quickly and easily is one of my hobbies I take most seriously . Why, you may ask? Because when I get sick, the last thing I want to do is spend hours in the kitchen making myself soup; followed by the impending doom of a million dishes that need to be done. So, as much as I love the traditional Chinese versions recipes I have tried, it was only a matter of time before I developed a short cut version. \nWith 30 minutes (or less) there is no need for a blender or saut\u00e9ing ingredients separately. For this recipe, you will throw almost all of the ingredients into a pot and bring them to a boil. Then you will add a couple other ingredients and voila! Hot & sour egg drop soup ready in under 30 minutes. Let\u2019s Get Started! \nSo what are you waiting for? Sick or not, this soup will satisfy your soul and tickle your tastebuds. Hot & Sour Egg Drop Soup: Ready in 30 minutes or less Servings: 6-8 Time: 30 MINUTES OR LESS!

Barrie. Whit MacLaughlin directs on the Arden\u2019s F. Otto Haas Stage. The Honorary Producer is the Hamilton Family Foundation. Ever since J.M. Barrie\u2019s story first appeared in 1904, countless versions have been produced on stage and in film. This version by Scottish playwright, Douglas Irvine, gets at the heart of J.M. Barrie\u2019s stories with bold theatricality, and celebrates the joy of storytelling and the power of imagination. Emilie Krause (left) and Jo Vito Ramirez (right) in PETER PAN at Arden Theatre Company through January 28th. www.ardentheatre.org. Photo by Mark Garvin. \nJoin Peter on his adventure to Neverland, a magical island where there are no parents, no chores, and fairies and pirates rule! Introduce your children and grandchildren to the characters you loved from J.M. Barrie\u2019s timeless masterpiece: Wendy Darling, Tinker Bell, Captain Hook, a horde of mischievous Lost Boys, Nana the dog, and \u2013 last but not least \u2013 a very hungry, ticking crocodile. \nArden Producing Artistic Director Terrence J. Nolen says, \u201cWe have been very fortunate to have a director of Whit\u2019s caliber to help us tell these stories over the past 20 years. He is committed to finding the most inventive and honest way possible to bring these classics to life in new and imaginative ways.\u201d \nDirector Whit MacLaughlin says, \u201cWhen I started directing for Arden Children\u2019s Theatre, my kids were very young and I felt like I was making a show for them every year. It\u2019s been a wonderful bond for our family, and I like being a hero once a year for my daughters.\u201d \nHe adds, \u201cI have always approached children\u2019s theatre in the same way I approach any other work. Always with respect for the story that is being told. It\u2019s important to find ways to honor the adult in the child, as well as the child in the adult. In this version of Peter Pan, you\u2019ll find that both the boys and girls are heroic, and everyone gets to be a swashbuckler. This is definitely a Peter Pan like you\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d \nThe role of Captain Hook is being played by Barrymore Award-winning actress Catherine Slusar. Slusar has extensive experience on local stages and has appeared previously in Arden Children\u2019s Theatre productions including The Borrowers, the BFG and Sideways Stories from the Wayside School.

Eliana Fabiyi, Brandon Pierce and Leah Walton round out the cast. \nPost-show question and answer sessions follow each performance.

implement RTE Act and in achieving universalisation of education in India... Follow @mediaamalendu \nHuge gaps in budgetary allocation is acting as a massive barrier to implement RTE Act and in achieving universalisation of education in India \nNew Delhi 6th December, 2017. RTE Forum. Today (6th Dec, 2017), Ministry of Finance convened a Pre-Budget Consultation under the chairmanship of Mr. Arun Jaitely, the Finance Minister of India. Mr. Ambarish Rai, the National Convenor of RTE Forum participating in the consultation and giving its submission raised the concerns regarding hugely inadequate financing of school education in India. Right to Education Forum which is a civil society coalition of 10000 organisations across the country, demanded at least 6% of GDP. He emphasised that India is long committed to spending at least 6% GDP on education. This was a recommendation of the Kothari Commission, formed part of both the UPA and the BJP election manifestoes and also part of India\u2019s EFA commitments internationally. However, India\u2019s spending continues to fall short. Indeed, India continues to spend below the global average on education (3.7% GDP, 2017). \nHe said that even after 7 years of commencement of the RTE Act, there is a teacher vacancy of 17.51% (more than 9 lakhs) in government schools at the elementary and at Secondary level it is 14.78%. Their service conditions, qualifications and salaries vary widely. There is a need to ensure availability of the prescribed number of trained teachers in these schools as per the RTE Act. Around 10 % percent primary schools are only single teachers.. As per official data, the share of professionally trained teacher varies from 52.2 percent in Bihar to 99 percent in Maharashtra (DISE, 2015-16). The District Institutes of Education and Training (DIETS), conceived as teacher training and curriculum development institutions, have failed to live up to their roles. Private teacher training institutes constitute 92 percent which acts primarily as business houses instead of providing constructive teacher training. \nMr. Rai pointed towards the fact that India failed to meet the MDGs of achieving universal primary education by 2015. The new set of UN SDGs (Sustainable Development goals) 2015-2030 to which India has committed for universalisation of education up to secondary level. Now, extension of RTE needed accordingly from pre primary to secondary level. The government must calculate the resources required for fulfilling the targets and objectives under the Act and provide for it over a stipulated period of time. \nRTE Forum gave its submission in pre budget consultation which demands mainly as follows: 1. Investment in RTE Implementation is investment in quality and learning, 2. Ensuring Availability of adequate numbers of trained and qualified teachers, Addressing Infrastructure gaps, 3. Need to address CAG Recommendations under the Audit of RTE Compliance, 4. Need to Increase Budgetary Allocation in Secondary Education and Universalise Education for Children Up To 18 Years, 5.

Device twins are important in the development and deployment of industrial IoT solutions. They act like virtual devices representing the data and metadata of the physical device connected to the IoT network. The rise of device twins has been noticed by one Gartner report, which placed this as a top five trend for 2016. The twin devices are typically called twins, shadows or device virtualization. Each device activated and registered with an IoT platform contain two categories of data. The first one is the metadata which doesn\u2019t change often. Here we include the details that describe precisely the device such as serial number, firmware version, model or year of manufacturing. The second category of data contains real-time and unique data from the device. Why is the digital twin so valuable? The concept of the digital twin is a powerful one that can bring real benefits such as: Visibility : the virtual version of the device allows visibility in the operations of the machines and also enables larger interconnected systems. Predictability : by using various modeling techniques, mathematics-based or physics-based, the digital replica can be utilized to predict a future state of the device. Analysis : through well-designed interfaces, the interaction with the model is simplified, and people could address \u201cwhat if\u201d questions to simulate various conditions that are impractical to create in real life. Documentation and communication mechanism : the digital twin can be used as a communication mechanism, which can provide understanding and explications for different behaviors. Connecting backend business applications : the digital twin can be used successfully to create a connection with the backend business app to achieve useful outcomes in the context of supply chain including procurement, transportation, and logistics. Industrial twins These implementations are adopted in general by the Industrial IoT providers, and these constitute information from the Product Lifecycle Management tools on the design of a machine, but it could also be designed as a model of one device. The industrial vendors look at the physical properties, the design of information and then present them in an asset model. These industrial twins could be implemented as: Virtual twin (device virtualization); Predictive twin (using analytics models); Twin Projections (insights projection); Within the next few years, billions of things will be represented by their twins, creating a dynamic software model of the physical item. The digital shadows combined with the representations of environments and facilities, as well as businesses, people or processes will enable a sophisticated digital image of the real world, suitable for analysis, simulation, and control. If you have questions about the topic do not hold back on them.

Is it valid because it's valid? No, it's valid because we are keeping a secret from you and thus limiting you to what we know of ourselves, thank you very much: that approach doesn't work in a real death cult. This could be a case of Eazy-E taunting Dr. Dre about Real Motherphukin G's or, more to the point, me in a harm reduction site, trying to get people off the streets and avoid the State paying MORE money into the coffers of the wrong drug dealers at month end and all points in between. I'm in three different death cults but really it's the same thing, palliative, alimentary and cognitive recourse to the sure and finite knowledge that one day, maybe today, you will be dead and what has been left in the world is the meaning and substance of your existence, not for the fact that you were even here. Can you imagine?\n\n\nIt's the non-stop mystification of the ordinary that really bugs me and since I'm a participant of a triptych arrangement that manifests in DrugsErosArt, I feel it necessary to say what I know to the fullest extent of whatever knowledge might transpire as being necessary in the realm of my cortex or my synaptic firings, my glands, my tumescence, whatever passion it took to get the Emergency Housing Maintenance Initiative (EHMI, call it Amy), off the ground, maybe it was friends in high places, an uncle in a federal cabinet post, a sister in a research capacity in health science at the University of Ottawa or doing data science for a Toronto LIN, maybe they thought it wise to include me in the proceedings or better yet, what if I were to simulate such an inclusion so as to provide some avenue around the gilded secret that is something akin to a dark room where there are pipes hanging down. You can walk in the room and hit your head on the pipes only so many times before you realize that other people not only know about the pipes, but put them there and won't tell you anything about it except to say that they think it's funny that they didn't tell you about it and also, they don't care about free and unobstructed use from the middle of the room. Now, this is a spurious example but what would happen were I to simulate the end of the secret? What would come of the process then, would people be obliged to catch themselves up? I can tell you with some degree of certainty and puzzlement at this point that there is no secret here that I'm referring to, that the notion of secrets in an age of information is almost preposterous and yet, with the advent of Big Data, entirely possible to simply create narrative that looks and sounds like everything else but is patently fake and with it, contains the seeds of difference for a group of people who claim familial ties and then proceed to murder one another with garrotes, cars and poison. Are you among that group of people? I should hope not, but if you are, keep reading and maybe we can work something out. \n\nIn this sense then, I started AMY and it's very simple, a program designed to work in concert with existing harm reduction initiatives and infrastructure insofar as AMY has a few layers and so it's best to start with the basic premise that the State spends far too much money on drugs, both in terms of giving welfare payments to addicts that can't be recovered and then housing those addicts in shelters that are in turn breeding grounds for the worst kinds of addictive behavior and indeed, as in the case of Seaton House in 2015, staff poisoning and strangling their own clients, referred to by name as \u201cvictims\u201d, something else I had to experience in order to get myself to the point where I could write about AMY as being a recourse for addicts AWAY from shelters where they might be murdered not only in robberies gone wrong but also harmed by malefactors who, (given I saw the murders in a hospital and a homeless shelter that are literally blocks apart), could be termed systemic in their hold over the esprit de corps of social services at the present time. So let's say that some miracle happens and they give me shoestring funding to get an AMY project off the ground, what are we doing exactly? Short form we are prescribing the drug of choice to an addict on a maintenance basis, similar methodology to the NAOMI project in Vancouver, except that we go one step further and project the necessary savings based on the level of maintenance use, which is to say, if you are being prescribed 2 points of heroin, which costs 60$ on the street, it costs us something like 5$ to prescribe that to you, so the savings on that particular cost split alone is 55$, never mind the amount of money the government COULD be willing to put into a collective bargaining fund that would force developers to stream their units as multi-purpose and guarantee that there would be subsidized social housing available in all but the most posh new condominium developments. In order to acquire the drugs, we would either be tapping into what I term \u201cstreet family\u201d or we would be relying on a hospital or pharmacy to provide us with morphine or heroin that would be suitable as a maintenance dose for people. Street family provisions means we buy right off the dealers and test the drugs in order to learn how to cut back toxic shipments and also to gauge the relative toxicity of drugs out there before it hits the main population of addicts. \n\nPart of my job then is overseeing a support network and that means a bit of coaching, a bit of coercion and a bit of point blank questioning (do you want to live or die? Maintenance is your best option to live, cuz) and so it goes that my day is over for the moment, a quiet day, only three people coming in to get their hit and talk to me to get referrals to pro-social outlets and programming and also for a maintenance support group that I chair every night at the site, tonight being the exception when I have someone from the local social services support ecology chairing the event because I have to go home for a personal matter. Now, don't laugh when you hear what this personal matter is but I have a surveillance girlfriend who has a current affairs show on around six o'clock on a local radio station and I tune in and take off my clothes for her once in a while... \n\nWhat? \n\nIt's kind of complex. She thinks of herself as my fool (sometimes). We are more or less broken up but for a while there we had a pretty hot emotional resonance happening. She came onto me when I was in rehab because with the power of undisclosed tech she can see right into where I am and she made use of that power in order to watch me when I was in bed with the wry comment that she would like to learn how to teleport. How do I know this is real? I don't and so when the demons came by to interrupt my striptease and demand what the fuck I was doing with my life after all these years and of course it's Maria Torres, my old literary flame, and she has friends with her, a plump lady with a demure, sour expression she introduced as Alicia Bolero and two wild eyed younger girls she said were Evita and Estella Morales, both of them bowing slightly to me, turning red and then promptly going upside down and hanging from the ceiling, popping gum and reading a fashion magazine. Demons, what can you do and apparently my surveillance lover can't see the same things I can see because she doesn't seem to understand what I'm looking at right in front of me, she thinks I'm on drugs again, she is exasperated, she is confounded, she is confined by her reason to the lower echelons of her brain and then suddenly she stops dead in the show and stops the mic and Maria gives me a slow burning kiss on the lips and I know we need to conceive, her and I, I need to have children to ease my infernal, aching heart and now the demons are teasing me, what are you doing for dinner, huh, why don't you go for a walk to the Distillery District, she's probably going to be there tonight, it's what a little bird told me, she dines there every Thursday night, alone, and then sometimes she puts in a call to (one) of her boyfriends or her mother or her grandmother or her sister, doesn't matter who the fuck she talks to Benn Gray, mind your own business except... \n\nIf only she would do the same. \n\n(in all honesty I don't really want to be left alone) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alicia bolero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benn gray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "estella morales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria torres", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "big data", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seaton house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emergency housing maintenance initiative", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of ottawa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "victoria st.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "distillery district", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:36.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f8c6651cb0deb2f60d136410e90f36ac7f2f5b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFrkvIihAjYHZrxZT4Awn8P20BM7zfvinpBaMblbt24jJVnc3_lt2SierUpQDJLrJvftKotUDSK2_Q--", "site_full": "gall.dcinside.com", "site": "dcinside.com", "site_section": "http://gall.dcinside.com/list.php?id=hos&page=19", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "\ud788\uc5b4\ub85c\uc988 \uc624\ube0c \ub354 \uc2a4\ud1b0 \uac24\ub7ec\ub9ac", "title": "\ube5b\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc2a4", "title_full": "\ube5b\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc2a4 -

Becky Coleman and Ellie Stubley on their way to winning the IM3 double sculls at Burway Head Picture: Luca Giachino 0 comments \nOXFORDSHIRE\u2019S clubs enjoyed senior success on the London Tideway \u2013 but the juniors had plenty to boast about at the Burway Small Boats Head, writes John Wiggins. \nThe annual Vesta Scullers Head in the capital turned out well for Oxford University women\u2019s coach, Jamie Kirkwood, who topped the times for the elite scullers. \nBut the overall title eluded him as differing tidal waters over the course of the race gave greater advantage to later starters. \nThat played into the hands of \u2018Freshers\u2019 winners, Richard Hume, of Oxford Brookes, and Wallingford RC\u2019s Christie Duff. \nFormer St Edward\u2019s pupil and Olympian, Tom Middleton, dominated the Masters B category. \nAnd in the Masters H it was a familiar picture with Tom Bishop winning ahead of Wallingford\u2019s Sean Morris and Charles Parry. \nForsaking the troubled tideway waters for the smoother and consistent Thames stream, Oxfordshire\u2019s scullers enjoyed a prosperous Burway Small Boats Head. \nWallingford\u2019s John Donohue was victorious in the Masters D category, while the younger club members won in the quads. \nTheir J16 boys (Richard Mangion, James Colam, Edward Devetta and Ben Sumner) and the J15 girls (Bethan Morrison, Anna Grace, Annie Burdess and Freya Sharp, coxed by Liberty Barlow) triumphed. \nHinksey Sculling School showed strength in numbers when winning in quads in both the WJ17 (Poppy Marshall, Jess Foster, Bonnie Coughlan and Alice Vine) and WJ16 (Harriet Wilson, Mae Willoughby, Helene Rittscher and Jojo Blyth). \nBlyth also tasted success in the novice single. \nIt turned out to be a good day for Andrew Clark, who claimed wins in the J17 double, with Rafe Stanford-Meisl, and J1 single. \nThere were also victories for William Wakefield (J18) and Stanley Cannons (senior IM3). \nCity of Oxford triumphed in the quad (Tilly Elliston, Ellen Grainger, Evie Tinegate, Abi Taylor and cox, Kathryn Grainger), while Robert McRae took the single. \nBecky Coleman and Ellie Stubley won the senior IM3 double sculls. \nSt Edward\u2019s School found themselves unopposed in their women\u2019s quad, but still completed the course as the fastest female boat. \nTeddie sculler Saskia Ward triumphed in the J15 singles.",

Nairobi \u2014 The Employment and Labour Relations Court has issued orders preventing the government from extending the term of office of the NGO Coordination Board Executive Director Fazul Mahamed pending the determination of a petition filed by activist Okiya Omtatah. In the orders, Justice Hellen Wasilwa directed that the Interior Cabinet Secretary should not renew Mahamed's term which expired last month nor re-appoint him pending the inter parties hearing of the case. She also prohibited Fazul from accessing offices of the NGO Coordination Board and carrying out the functions of the body. \"An interim order is issued restraining the respondent and its agents or any person purporting to act under its authority from renewing, re-appointing, or in any way whatsoever extending the interested parties contractual tenure as the Executive Director of the NGO Coordination Board which expired on November 23rd 2017 pending the interpartes hearing and determination of this application and the petition herein,\" she stated. In his suit papers Omtatah argued that Mahamed's three-year tenure as executive director at the board expired and that he should have taken terminal leave. He wants an acting executive director appointed in the transition period pending the competitive recruitment and appointment of a substantive office holder. The board, which is operating without members, was moved from the Devolution to Interior Ministry. In November 2016, the Commission on Administrative Justice, known as the Ombudsman, declared Mahamed unfit to hold public office. This was corroborated by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) which ordered fresh investigations into his suitability in May 2017. Mahamed has, however, remained unmoved nor no action has been taken against him.

This one has no side support because they cut costs by leaving out the storage drawer. Because of this, the sides colapsed when the movers brought it in. We repaired it and accepted the discount credit but when we got it in discovered several other production shortcuts. The most noticable was the lact of a top light making it impossible to see without adding some sort of light. I rigged up a desk light but because the knobs were stainless steel, the glare from them with the light made the numbers impossible to see. The stainless steel is very cheap. We notice this because our sinks are stainless steel, made in 1957. They are side by side with the stove and the difference in obvious. The stove is very difficult to shine because of this. Finally, as I already mentioned, the lack of a storage drawer is very problematic and totally unnecessary as there is nothing in the empty space. They just put a cover over it and saved production costs. The problem here is there are no other 40 inch stoves made in the US so you are stuck with this one.

Chelmsford Chieftains shows how far the team have come. \nA 4-0 success at a side who had only lost once this season saw Stars stay six points clear at the top of the South Division 2 table. \nAnd Redmond was delighted with his side\u2019s display in securing a tenth successive victory. \n\u201cChelmsford is a difficult place to come to, they are very competitive and there won\u2019t be many sides this season who come away with a shut-out,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted with the win and the manner of it. We had a few players out, but showed our strength in depth and resilience. \n\u201cIt was a good team performance and to earn a shut-out for the second game running shows we are doing the right things and giving our offensive players the platform to play.\u201d \nStars were on the back foot early on, but gradually began to get on top. \nThey took the lead in the seventh minute, when Matt Lawday fired home, assisted by Josh Florey and Joe Edwards. \nDom Hopkins thought he had made it 2-0, only for his effort to be disallowed. \nHowever, within four minutes of the second period starting Oxford had doubled their advantage through Josh Oliver. \nAnd they went a long way to securing maximum points just two minutes later with Andy Cox\u2019s goal. \nStars refused to take their foot off the gas in the final period and wrapped up victory when Hopkins found the net, assisted by Mike Whillock and Joe Edwards.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kenny redmond", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "redmond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt lawday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh oliver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dom hopkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy cox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike whillock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hopkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe edwards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh florey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "oxford city stars", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chelmsford chieftains", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "oxford", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chelmsford", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:44:37.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c5fdd96e11b9bb629f1eb76ae83b535261f55d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_9XNWKvROtZQ4qzx33HrsnRo_jS8SqVDn4O0cjXBj9luNlNgWgfEpM7yqKk1AJGIRd9UKnBOhdjUH5Fbpgv2439lNBdNxoT1abZgi5nldYK41IuJ9HPEx4TWzUHbSoeMvr4WV0mmQau7sVgFGZe9PZ9q9Vxx99Dq0-", "site_full": "www.oxfordmail.co.uk", "site": "oxfordmail.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/sport/rss/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Oxford Mail | Sport", "title": "ATHLETICS: Ben West impresses to claim second in Chiltern League third round", "title_full": "ATHLETICS: Ben West impresses to claim second in Chiltern League third round", "published": "2017-12-07T09:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/resources/images/7150183/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 88840, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c5fdd96e11b9bb629f1eb76ae83b535261f55d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_9XNWKvROtZQ4qzx33HrsnRo_jS8SqVDn4O0cjXBj9luNlNgWgfEpM7yqKk1AJGIRd9UKnBOhdjUH5Fbpgv2439lNBdNxoT1abZgi5nldYK41IuJ9HPEx4TWzUHbSoeMvr4WV0mmQau7sVgFGZe9PZ9q9Vxx99Dq0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "ATHLETICS: Ben West impresses to claim second in Chiltern League third round", "text": "ATHLETICS: Ben West impresses to claim second in Chiltern League third round Bicester's Ben West looks relaxed on his way to second in the under 17 boys race in the Chiltern League Picture: Barry Cornelius 0 comments \nBEN West delivered an outstanding performance to finish second in the under 17 men\u2019s race at the third round of the Chiltern League in Luton. \nThe Bicester youngster was also the first Division 2 runner home, crossing in a time of 18min 24secs. \nAbingdon\u2019s Adam Ede, who was a guest runner, finished eighth. \nIn the under 15 race, Bicester\u2019s Max Nicolle came eighth. \nHeadington\u2019s Sam O\u2019Neill was the top performing Oxfordshire club runner in the senior men\u2019s race, crossing 30th overall. \nBanbury Harrier Sam Davis took 12th in the under 11 event. \nMartha Lloyd impressed to finish ninth in the senior women\u2019s race. \nClubmate Daisy Palmer came tenth in the under 15 competition, with Bicester\u2019s Amelia Cox 14th. \nIn the under 11 event, City\u2019s Isabella Haines-Gray performed well to take fourth. \nOTHER RESULTS \nCHILTERN CROSS COUNTRY LEAGUE \nDIVISION 1 \nHeadington RR \u2013 Men: 25 S O\u2019Neill 30.39, 41 T Willner-Reid 31.24, 63 D Lawrence 32.44, 75 A Aimon 33.07, 76 A Hanner Hopwood 33.09 (V40), 77 F Campbell 33.17 (V40), 91 K Lowies 33.53 (V50), 107 R Skilbeck 34.28 (V40), 115 T Clarke 34.53, 142 A Darbyshire 36.35 (V50), 143 John Griffiths 36.43 (V50), 179 S Khan 40.07 (V40), 187 K Byrne 41.07 (V60), 218 P Lister 48.44 (V60).

Coach Ben McAdoo and general manager Jerry Reese were fired the next day and interim coach Steve Spagnuolo announced Wednesday that Eli Manning will start Sunday against Cowboys. \n\u201cAny competitor wouldn\u2019t be [happy] to be put in that situation where you get a chance to play and then you are being pulled.\u201d Smith said Wednesday. \u201cBut it\u2019s not because you played bad. So it is, you are trying to figure out why. You have to understand things happen in this business and you got to roll with it.\u201d \nOne thing Smith could explain is why he apologized after the game on Twitter for the loss and his postgame comments bashing Rex Ryan , his coach with the Jets. see also OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 If Geno Smith needed a little extra... \n\u201cI wasn\u2019t apologizing to him,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI was apologizing for the distraction.\u201d \nSmith tried not to be one Wednesday. Spagnuolo, who said his gut told him starting Manning \u2014 who asked for his job back \u2014 was the right decision, said he was pleased with how Smith took the news of his demotion. \n\u201cI have a great deal of respect for Geno Smith in the way he reacted,\u201d Spagnuolo said. \u201cHe was a man. He obviously didn\u2019t agree with the decision, but he is a team player.\u201d \nSmith said he doesn\u2019t believe he got a raw deal and appreciates McAdoo making a decision to start him when \u201cnot a lot of people would have.\u201d \n\u201cAs far as like any sympathy or something like that, I\u2019m not looking for it,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t need any sympathy.
