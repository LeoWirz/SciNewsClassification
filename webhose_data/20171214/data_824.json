Globally, adoption of biological surgical sealants is increasing at a significant rate owing to their absorbable nature and because they are associated with minimal complications compared with synthetic sealants and adhesives. Biological products generate less of a foreign body response and they are more resistant to infections. \nDrivers of Surgical Sealants and Adhesives Market: According to the report, one of the major drivers for this market is increase in volume of surgeries. Surgical sealants are used to block the passage of fluids during surgeries and surgical adhesives are used for the closure of wounds or to bind two body tissues.

Alibaba in a statement on Thursday said digital marketing-focused Alimama and operating system firm AliOS would be among subsidiaries working with Ford under the three-year agreement. One avenue under consideration is the sale of Ford cars on Tmall, an Alibaba spokeswoman said. Reuters on Wednesday reported that Ford was planning to sign such a deal as it overhauls its China strategy to stimulate growth. \"The agreement aims to explore new ways to redefine how consumers purchase and own vehicles, as well as how to leverage digital channels to identify new retail opportunities,\" Alibaba said in its statement. The Chinese e-commerce firm and U.S. automaker will initially \"explore a pilot study\" for new retail opportunities, Alibaba said. Ford President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett in the statement said collaborating with technology firms builds on its vision to make \"smart vehicles\". Ford's China sales have been sluggish in recent months as it struggles to keep pace with rapidly changing trends, including increased demand for entry-level cars in smaller cities. Meanwhile Alibaba is increasing its presence in the automotive sector with Banma Technologies, a partnership with SAIC Motor Corp Ltd developing Internet-connected cars.

Credit: G. Baranov Researchers from Cologne, Tallinn, and Edinburgh have found out that the compound eyes of today\u2019s arthropods are still constructed in much the same way as they were in their ancestors 500 million years ago. The research team looked at fossil trilobites . However, these arthropods lacked the lenses of contemporary compound eyes. The zoologist Dr Brigitte Schoenemann and her colleagues have now published the results of their research in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nDr Brigitte Schoenemann (University of Cologne) and her colleagues Helje P\u00e4rnaste (Tallinn, Estonia), and Euan Clarkson (Edinburgh, Scotland) have succeeded in unraveling the structure and functioning of the oldest known compound eye. The researchers used an exceptionally well-preserved fossil trilobite (Schmidtiellus reetae), which is over half a billion years old, showing the cellular structure of a compound eye. It not only shows how this eye was constructed, but also its functioning, its performance, and how it differs from contemporary compound eyes. The results show that modern compound eyes work in ways strikingly similar to those of half a billion years ago. They are very conservative in their structure \u2014 and quite successfully so. \u201cThe principle of the modern compound eye most likely goes back to before the times of our first fossil records. Half a billion years ago, it was in the early stage of its development, and with our work we have succeeded in uncovering the first visible steps of this extremely successful visual principle,\u201d says Schoenemann.\nThe eye belongs to a trilobite found in Estonia, an extinct arthropod that lived in the oceans of the Palaeozoic . The findings from this geological layer have brought to light the very first fossils of complex animals. The right eye of the trilobite is slightly abraded, allowing for a view into its interior. It is a typical compound eye consisting of approximately 100 subunits placed relatively far apart compared to modern forms. The authors were able to show that each of these subunits (ommatidia) consists of about eight sensory cells \u2014 just like modern compound eyes \u2014 grouped around a central rhabdom, a light-guiding receptive structure. The latter contains the visual pigments and conveys the brightness of the surrounding environment to the animal\u2019s central nervous system.\n\u201cHowever, in contrast to the modern compound eyes of bees, dragonflies, and many crabs, this very old compound eye does not have a lens,\u201d Schoenemann explains. \u201cThis is likely due to the fact that these rather soft-shelled arthropods lacked the necessary layer in their shell responsible for lens formation.\u201d The physical features of the central rhabdom ensures that each element of the compound eye has a limited field of vision and that the animal\u2019s overall visual impression already has the mosaic-like character of a modern compound eye. The precision of such an eye can be determined by the number of its elements \u2014 just like the number of pixels determines the precision of a computer graphic. \u201cWith approximately 100 \u2018pixels,\u2019 the performance of this eye dating back more than half a billion years is certainly not outstanding. But it was sufficient to provide the trilobite with information on movement in its field of vision, for example approaching predators. It could roughly discern the distribution of light in its surroundings or avoid obstacles in its path,\u201d says Schoenemann.\nThe biologist and her team were also able to show that only a few million years after Schmidtiellus, new and improved compound eyes with higher resolution developed in another trilobite from the Baltic region: Holmia kjerulfi. The performance of this species\u2019 eyes even approximated that of modern dragonflies. A physical analysis of the compound eyes of both trilobites showed that the organism inhabited bright waters, most likely coastal shelf regions of a Palaeozoic ocean.\nReference: \nBrigitte Schoenemann, Helje P\u00e4rnaste, Euan N.

The tumor blood flow (TBF), fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD) of the enhanced lesion and related edema were calculated. The lesion was categorized as recurrence/residual or postradiation changes.\nResults There was significant differences between residual/recurrent gliomas and postradiation changes of TBF ( P \u2009=\u20090.001), FA ( P \u2009=\u20090.001 and 0.04), and MD ( P \u2009=\u20090.001) of enhanced lesion and related edema respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of TBF of enhanced lesion and related edema used to differentiate residual/recurrent gliomas from postradiation changes were 0.95 and 0.93 and of MD were 0.95 and 0.81 and of FA were 0.81 and 0.695, respectively. Combined ASL and DTI metrics of the enhanced lesion revealed AUC of 0.98, accuracy of 95%, sensitivity of 93.8%, specificity of 95.8%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 93.8%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 95.8%. Combined metrics of ASL and DTI of related edema revealed AUC of 0.97, accuracy of 92.5%, sensitivity of 93.8%, specificity of 91.7%, PPV of 88.2%, and NPV of 95.7.\nConclusion Combined ASL and DTI metrics of enhanced lesion and related edema are valuable noninvasive tools in differentiating residual/recurrent gliomas from postradiation changes.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AyyMKS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "dti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asl", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:17.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e0f0b5b9f459515a81a55766b217c57cc957ec73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhQLUPVZEle268aqpZ3kkm5t039UvwlyNv3C4Jqw3OQqRoDMHanXFVvAT_Yu__.saVo3PZ3HKpQIwQP3EFWCWYNvrdlPbtVevln75KzOQ22adhnkWikJP9fkB0.JEU20eYstq9VIAn6A1teT4NBC6asfOvIWLL2iwi4X05XxlP4Osqa6SVYsJoOV", "site_full": "www.chennaiclassic.com", "site": "chennaiclassic.com", "site_section": "http://www.chennaiclassic.com/feed/1/posts", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "Chennai  - ChennaiClassic.com", "title": "Apple MacBook Pro MC976LL/A 15.4-Inch Laptop with Retina Display", "title_full": "Apple MacBook Pro MC976LL/A 15.4-Inch Laptop with Retina Display", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.chennaiclassic.com/adpics/5a290f80d61c224d0be504f16.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 64302, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e0f0b5b9f459515a81a55766b217c57cc957ec73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhQLUPVZEle268aqpZ3kkm5t039UvwlyNv3C4Jqw3OQqRoDMHanXFVvAT_Yu__.saVo3PZ3HKpQIwQP3EFWCWYNvrdlPbtVevln75KzOQ22adhnkWikJP9fkB0.JEU20eYstq9VIAn6A1teT4NBC6asfOvIWLL2iwi4X05XxlP4Osqa6SVYsJoOV", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "Apple MacBook Pro MC976LL/A 15.4-Inch Laptop with Retina Display", "text": "Apple MacBook Pro MC976LL/A 15.4-Inch Laptop with Retina Display Reply to: (Use contact form below) (Please mention ChennaiClassic.com when contacting) The Largest Marketplace of Electronics and Digital Products in China,We sell original Products with low price and quality wholesale goods,the item is discount for sale During 2017's Christmas day, Best deals for Electronics from Trusted wholesalers: www.proudsale.com 15.4-inch Retina display with LED backlighting and IPS technology (2880 x 1800-pixel resolution, 220 pixels per inch) 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 quad-core processor (3.6 GHz with Turbo Boost Technology;

Back to Article news The Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission has arrested a retired Appeal Court judge for allegedly demanding bribe to the tune of N200m. According to a statement by ICPC spokesperson, Rasheedat Okoduwa , the retired judge, whose name was given as Justice Mohammed Tsamiya , allegedly demanded a N200m bribe in exchange for a favourable judgment in a National Assembly election case that was pending before the Imo State Judicial Division of the Court of Appeal. The commission says it arrested Justice Tsamiya, for allegedly demanding N200m bribe from Mr. Nnamdi Orji , in exchange for a favourable judgment in a National Assembly election case that was pending before the Imo State Judicial Division of the Court of Appeal. The ICPC said the offence, which violates Section 10 of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000, was alleged to have been committed in 2015. The retired Justice asked Orji, who was the candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance for the Arochukwu/Ohafia Federal Constituency, to give him N200m to enable him to influence the court\u2019s decision in his favour.

Everton have reportedly emerged as shock contenders to pursue the services of Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang . The Gabon international has been linked with a winter exit from the Westfalenstadion amid his recent disciplinary issues. The 28-year-old has been a regular goalscorer for the Bundesliga outfit, having contributed 25 or more goals in each of the last three seasons. Likewise, he has started the current campaign in fine fashion with 19 goals in 20 appearances, but his future at BvB is hanging in the balance. Aubameyang has attracted plenty of transfer interest with Chelsea and Arsenal among his long-time admirers while Liverpool have also been associated with Jurgen Klopp keen a reunion with the former Saint-Etienne man.

The Phi Delta Theta fraternity was placed on suspension in October. Rush says USI is not investigating any other fraternities right now. He says he feels the Greek culture is strong and safe for their students. @14News \u2014 Kate O'Rourke (@Kate14News) December 5, 2017 \nAs for whether any USI students are facing criminal charges, Vanderburgh Co. Sheriff Dave Wedding tells us the sheriff's office hasn't been called to investigate. \nRush says the university has no intention of allowing the fraternity back on campus in the future. \nMason Hendricks is a junior at USI and a member of the fraternity. He sent us this statement on Wednesday: \n***The statement below reflects my personal views only, and not those of the entire Indiana Lambda chapter*** \nAlthough there is full cooperation with USI and Phi Delta Theta\u2019s General Headquarters, I personally do not agree with the final decision that was made. The sanctions given to us on Monday were not justified. A mistake did occur within our Fraternity, but it does not reflect the culture of the Indiana Lambda chapter of Phi Delta Theta whatsoever. It was an isolated incident that was being taken very seriously and being handled internally within our organization. Our chapter had a zero tolerance for hazing and therefore, did not condone any form of it by any of its members. We strived to always hold each other to the highest standard in everything that we did. Pushed out from under the spotlight and into the shadows is our organization\u2019s contributions to not only USI, but the surrounding community. We took great pride in the thousands of dollars we were fortunate enough to raise for charitable organizations each semester, as well as the numerous community service events that we were able to volunteer at. We truly cherished the involvement that we had and the relations that we had built, both on campus and in the community. \nFollow us online at 14NEWS.com and on Twitter .

Among them, the clinical rollators are perceived as the low-end premium products, which are at a comparatively higher price. For instance, there is a substantial price difference between a cane and a clinical rollator owing to the difference in product features such as stability, balance, and smooth mobility, which can lead to the increased price of a clinical rollator.

The event will take place in two parts: one open discussion that is free admission from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and a fine art fundraiser gala from 6-9 p.m.\nThis event specifically targets the medical benefits of using the natural remedies of cannabis to treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.\nThe first portion will take place in Montezuma Hall and is free admission for anyone.\nThis segment will have featured speakers like Heather Manus, Ken Sobel, Brian Krumm and Kyle Turley.\nThe second portion of the event is a gala featuring musicians Denny Seiwell, Marlon Martinez and Sami Shapiro, as well as artists John Jazanjian, Dale Mathis, Chris Green, Linda Jacobson, Mark Lewis, Nic McGuire and Mikel Patrick.\n\u0093Our goal is to reach out to as many people in need,\u0094 former SDSU Monty Montezuma and C4C member Carlos Gutierrez said. \u0093There\u0092s a lot of sick people we can see it in our military with PTSD and CTE in regards to concussions from soccer players to football players to people in car crashes.\u0094\nThe discussion will be targeting the science behind the endocannabinoid deficiency and the use of cannabinoids in helping understand and better treat PTSD. With CTE, the goal of the conversation is to create an opportunity to do further research and create protocol that will prevent more injuries from happening during athletic events.\nFormer NFL player and SDSU alumni Kyle Turley will be speaking at the first event discussing his company, Neuro Armor, and his experience making the transition from using opioids to cannabis.\nNeuro Armor is a CBD oil company that works to combat brain injuries in sports and is a natural preventative to brain injuries.\n\u0093I do not take one opiate or synthetic medicine to date going on three years now, and I feel significantly better than I did when I was on opiates,\u0094 Turley said.\nHe said he believes cannabis can stop the opioid epidemic America is currently facing and wants to educate people on the medical uses of marijuana rather than the recreational use.\n\u0093It\u0092s not about getting high, but it\u0092s about relief and getting better and using it in a healthy place and not getting addicted to opiates,\u0094 Gutierrez said.\nHe said this is the first \u0093Cannabis 4 the Cause\u0094 event and it was chosen to be hosted at SDSU to incorporate the educational aspect of studying and researching the plant to better understand its medical benefits.\n\u0093It\u0092s imperative that universities research this and study it and document it in studies with collegiate athletes,\u0094 Turley said.\nTurley used to be an athlete. He said he wants to help set up a protocol and a way to prevent head injuries that cause CTE so other athletes don\u0092t have to suffer from an addiction to opioids like he did.\nThis event will have an open discussion, but will not be selling any marijuana products.\n\u0093We want to pay it forward to the community with healthiest alternatives\u0094 Bianca Martinez, event coordinator, said. \u0093Many people are just into the recreational side and I wanted something with no products, only educating the public.\u0094\nThose putting on the event encourage people to engage in the conversation and have an open mind to the science and medical research behind cannabis.\nTo RSVP and purchase tickets go to c4cevent .\n\u0093Come learn about the truth and the science,\u0094 Turley said.\n Cannabis event smokes opioid addiction \u2013 The Daily Aztec\nAuthor: Sofia Bert\nContact: Contact \u2013 The Daily Aztec\nPhoto Credit: Shutterstock\nWebsite: The Daily Aztec \u2013 San Diego State University\u2019s Independent Student Newspaper Since 1913", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://thedailyaztec.com/86674/artsandculture/cannabis-event-smokes-opioid-addiction/", "http://thedailyaztec.com/", "http://thedailyaztec.com/contact/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:17.042+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0d21ed17c7d57fb1e831390794023caa947d74c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZeQ6FfIkhdBXRfqQVX.gYNFZl5F4G.RJCKQZFQF0FnAV3B19pI5LsPyTb.wOGY5wcpqknqCBjQDPFtu86hLNyvkzNxwCUkXwE-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money", "title": "Steam stop accepting Bitcoin (core), mempool clogging up, tx fee skyrocket, while the price of Bitcoin (core) still keep going up.

New investor Crane Venture Partners joins angel investors Peter Simon, founder of retailer Monsoon, and Steve Garnett, former chairman of Salesforce EMEA. \nAccording to analyst firm Gartner, through 2017, a full 60% of big data projects will fail to go beyond piloting and experimentation, and will be abandoned. AVORA was founded by serial entrepreneur Ricky Thomas, who previously established and sold two online companies \u2013 DatingUK and PetMeds. After experiencing the data challenges when running businesses firsthand, Thomas developed AVORA, offering a Software as a Service solution that redefines how companies get value from their data. \nAVORA founder and CEO Ricky Thomas commented: \u201cThe first wave of business intelligence software left many companies with multi-million-pound investments that do not provide a holistic view of company data. Traditional BI just generates charts, doesn\u2019t tell where you look or help you do your job, there\u2019s nothing intelligent about them. With AVORA we have created a software service to connect disparate data sources without the massive infrastructure investment and coding knowledge.\u201d \nAVORA, which was founded in 2014, consolidates data from hundreds of sources within an organisation, allowing access to users to analyse and act on the information that\u2019s important to them. Utilising machine learning, AVORA automatically detects anomalies and trends, alerting users to key changes in business metrics. AVORA has secured clients in retailing, media, and advertising who use their technology to keep track of customer churn, review advertising spend, and monitor performance on current in-market campaigns, along with other applications. \nThomas continued: \u201cUsing machine learning technology, AVORA provides business users with a smart system to monitor your business and suggest improvements that drive business outcomes, in real time. AVORA gives business leaders the benefits of having an experienced department of data scientists providing ongoing business insights that improve business performance without the major time and cost investments.\u201d \nScott Sage, partner at Crane Venture Partners, stated: \u201cUsing AVORA gives businesses the advantages of a team of data scientists and business analysts without the upfront investment of typical business intelligence systems and data science teams. We\u2019re impressed with what the company has already built and see great potential for AVORA to bring its next-generation Business Intelligence to businesses around the world.\u201d \nAfter finding initial traction with large ecommerce companies, AVORA is seeing demand from other industries looking to manage real-time data and turn it into actionable business insights. Recently, companies such as ad agencies AKA, Adtrak, and Karmarama have adopted AVORA to drive business performance for their advertising clients. The new funding will enable AVORA to expand into the US and hire more senior business leaders in enterprise technology, including recent hires from Salesforce.com, Splunk, and more.

Put your ideas out there even if you think it may be wrong. The one thing that I think really made me stand out was that I presented a research article on every one of my patients.

But then at that moment there, we had a prayer and we said our goodbyes, said we love you,\" the 20-year-old said Wednesday.\n\"We had a horrible moment there that we felt like we weren't going to make it \u2026 It was very, very intense to go through something like that.\"\nHe and his younger brother, Lester, his cousin, Dylan and his mother, Nancy, were four of six people rescued by firefighters from the third floor of their apartment building at 489 Furby St., after a fire broke out on the second storey. Six other people escaped on their own, and the building next door was evacuated because of the heavy smoke and water used in firefighting efforts.\nThe effort involved nearly 60 crew members on rotation and lasted into the following morning. The McIvor family lost everything except what they were wearing and have been staying in a relative's one-bedroom apartment down the street.\nOn Wednesday, they got to meet some of the firefighters who rescued them, and were handed a cheque for $500 to help them rebuild.\n'The only fire escape was the window,' says woman rescued from Furby apartment blaze Fire destroys apartment building, sends 3 people to hospital\n\"I'm happy to see them all together as a family. No one got hurt and that's the bottom line,\" said Lt. Scott Lucas, one of four firefighters who broke down the door and found the family.\n\"It's hard, and especially this time of year, to see a family lose most of everything they have including their shoes. But family is everything, and lives saved is worth it enough.\"\n'It was horrific'\nDwight McIvor was in his bedroom playing video games Monday night when he heard the building's fire alarm go off and thought nothing of it. The alarm went off frequently in the building for no reason, he said.\n\"Right away, at the moment, I dismissed the idea of a fire because it happens all the time,so I just continued on playing [the] game,\" he said.\n\"But I made sure to listen out. I heard my younger brother open the front door and I was listening for him \u2026 A minute later, I heard him running up the stairs, I heard him say, 'a real fire.'\"\nHe went to the living room to see what was going on without turning off his game. Through the headset he left sitting in his bedroom, he said the friends he was playing with could hear parts of the commotion.\n'We felt like we weren't going to make it': Survivors of Furby St. fire relive rescue 2:39\nBoth the front and back doors were blocked by smoke so thick they couldn't see, so the family made its way to Dwight's bedroom, where the smoke was lighter.\nThey huddled there for more than half an hour before Lucas and his team broke down the door and escorted them out.\n\"We were at the verge of saying goodbye to one another and saying our goodbyes, and to be saved like that and to hear somebody breaking the doors and opening that door, says, 'I got four here!' \u2014 I knew we were going to get saved,\" Nancy McIvor said.\nLucas said it was a relief for him, too.\n\"It's a relief to know you got everyone off that floor. That's what you're tasked to do, that's what you want to make sure happens,\" he said. \"You don't want to leave anyone behind. The guys did a crackerjack job.\"\nDwight McIvor said the meeting was \"amazing.\"\n\"We relived that night ... ever since it happened. [From] the moment we were leaving to the moment we were in the hospital to even today, right now. We keep reliving that moment of almost dying, because it's a very traumatic experience. It was horrific. It was very scary, and I'm glad we made it out alive,\" he said.\n\"That was the most relieving feeling I have ever felt was seeing that firefighter come through my bedroom door, and seeing someone come save us where we felt like there was nothing we could've done.\"\nWith files from Jill Taylor", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dwight mcivor", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "lester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dylan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jill taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dwight", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy mcivor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcivor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott lucas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "furby", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "furby st.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:19.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6898aa5e623d075a93f5ee62902c04f236c195fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSv1D9ZbkQFmMQgnw2m4NktUNlqnXW.16cPYlXbpgxXKeRgsy2pV8ZbFmn9x0TmK4Cu23.jlewObfgQK2oqwWxSuey..eh_f3sYY7fDKZxTIhZidYuJBlVuBXYjUKaDIsT", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wheredidthesodago/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "The mystery of the soda.", "title": "New from Mark Zuckerberg: HOW TO CONSUME SPHERICAL NUTRIENT CORES LIKE THE HUMAN YOU DEFINITELY ARE", "title_full": "New from Mark Zuckerberg: HOW TO CONSUME SPHERICAL NUTRIENT CORES LIKE THE HUMAN YOU DEFINITELY ARE : wheredidthesodago", "published": "2017-12-04T20:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 173, "participants_count": 136, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a409590825a9c4a62e23c1ba1531141dae04d365", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSv1D9ZbkQFmMQgnw2m4NktUNlqnXW.16cPYlXbpgxXKeRgsy2pV8ZbFmn9x0TmK4Cu23.jlewObfgQK2oqwWxSuey..eh_f3sYY7fDKZxTIhZidYuJBlVuCebQTPUXfMFeqgtRACMWsPmfxoqq5hgSQ--", "ord_in_thread": 172, "author": "souffle-etc", "published": "2017-12-05T22:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "idk if that's for real but i appreciate you and your comment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:19.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d094b189242fdac213dbc3448828a1781598f3a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8vUdzJk69cXLbt6Og5ndAlgtfCJTNxg62rYaDUD89A9b0MkFR8J2RIXAy2Q9vCzw4-", "site_full": "www.akfiles.com", "site": "akfiles.com", "site_section": "http://www.akfiles.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=2", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "General Discussion - The AK Files Forums", "title": "How do you start over at 60?", "title_full": "How do you start over at 60? - The AK Files Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T09:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 73634, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c12afc44c08c01c7beff20e6c462aad1805aafc5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8vUdzJk69cXLbt6Og5ndAlgtfCJTNxg62rYaDUD89A9b0MkFR8J2RIW4utXvQLFjSE_LwAbnvdPygJmVnSvSxJ", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "mike88", "published": "2017-12-07T09:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Follow your heart, enjoy the lack of drama and constant resentment, get a dog and a van.
