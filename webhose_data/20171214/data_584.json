Evans said cops had been called to the Tobin community center for a disturbance about 7:47 p.m. and were outside the building when gunshots were heard up the street.\n\u201cThey heard multiple gunshots being fired less than a block away,\u201d Evans said. \u201cThey quickly went down to that location and found three individuals shot.\u201d\nHe said the victims were found on Parker, Tremont and Sewall streets.\nThe teen found on Parker Street was taken to Boston Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. Evans said the other two were hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\u201cWe are hoping and praying the other two make it,\u201d Evans said. \u201cBut obviously right now we need the public\u2019s help. ... Everyone should be outraged when something happens like this to these young kids. There are way too many guns on the street.\u201d\nEvan said it\u2019s important to get the shooter or shooters off the street to prevent any retaliation.\nHe said there were 200 young people inside the community center when the shooting happened.\nThe Rev. Mark Scott of the Ella J. Baker House and the city\u2019s trauma response team responded to the scene as well. Scott said he is concerned for the teens who poured out of the center and into a murder scene.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a traumatic event. It\u2019s a frightening event. It\u2019s an upsetting event,\u201d Scott said. \u201cSo what we\u2019ll be working on is reaching out to those young people and having conversations with them, and with each other and with their families, so they can be on the road to recovery and healing.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christopher evans", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "o\u2019ryan johnson", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "william b. evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sewall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tobin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ella j. baker house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mission hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tremont street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parker street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:52.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72983596359774435958ecc578a22601de08da46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Raclk.ajWaTcg_eac3OyoWNtgt8aOPGJY0Zd23sr1rQiTgxOv7OLubCcyEN6OFa5A6Z3amEW0IPcOhtBM5.FexWfcqWiNsYK78B0LZBu4JWQ--", "site_full": "america-here.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://america-here.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "America Here", "title": "Seth Meyers Nails What Trump Means When He Says \u2018Law And Order\u2019", "title_full": "Seth Meyers Nails What Trump Means When He Says \u2018Law And Order\u2019", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "72983596359774435958ecc578a22601de08da46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Raclk.ajWaTcg_eac3OyoWNtgt8aOPGJY0Zd23sr1rQiTgxOv7OLubCcyEN6OFa5A6Z3amEW0IPcOhtBM5.FexWfcqWiNsYK78B0LZBu4JWQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JOHAN BROWN (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "Seth Meyers Nails What Trump Means When He Says \u2018Law And Order\u2019", "text": "\u201cThink about that.

The Surge A Walk In The Park DLC also includes Xbox One X enhancements allowing the game to look even more fantastic thanks to the 4K Ultra HD and HDR support of the new Microsoft console previously codenamed Project Scorpio. Watch the launch trailer for the new Walk In The Park content for an overview of what you can expect. \nThe Surge brought players deep into the high-tech CREO industrial complex, overrun by deadly machines, rogue AI and deranged exoskeleton workers. A Walk in the Park gives players a breath of fresh air by taking them to an environment that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more open and colorful, though no less deadly. CREO World is an amusement park built by CREO for its employees and their families. The entire park is a deadly trap, where roaming rescue teams have gone insane and robotic mascots patrol freely, patiently waiting for new visitors to offer a deadly welcome. \nOriginally created to celebrate CREO and its mission, the park is a radically different setting from the rest of the complex, full of branching paths and secrets to discover. Through technical and spectacular fights, you will face this new threat, cutting and equipping 16 all-new weapons, sets of armor, and new implants to upgrade and further customize the way you want to play. \nNew players can embark on the ultimate Surge experience with the Complete Edition, which will include the full game and all its DLC, including A Walk in the Park.

K-12 \nLet's start with K-12. There, Republicans from both sides of Congress generally agree on two big changes. \nSaving for private school \nTaxpayers can currently save money for college through a 529 plan, where earnings grow tax-free. Many states also offer deductions for contributions. In the proposals, Republicans want to let taxpayers use 529s to pay for K-12 tuition at private and religious schools, too. Families can already do that with a different plan \u2014 Coverdell Education Savings Accounts \u2014 but these have low contribution limits and aren't open to high-income Americans. The move to expand the 529 would dramatically increase who could use these plans and the money they could save. \n\"I think the only taxpayers who will be in a position to benefit from the 529 change are very rich people,\" says Nora Gordon, an economist and associate professor at Georgetown University. She says using these accounts to save for elementary or high school won't help much unless you can afford to set aside a lot of money early on. No wonder, when the Government Accountability Office studied 529s and Coverdells a few years ago, it found \"families with these accounts had about 25 times the median financial assets\" of those who didn't use them and \"about three times the median income.\" \nWhile the proposed expansion of 529 plans would largely help affluent parents who use private schools, Republicans are proposing another change that could hurt funding for the nation's public schools. \nThe SALT (state and local taxes) deduction \nUp to now, taxpayers who itemize their deductions \u2014 generally high-earners who make up about a third of households in the U.S. \u2014 have gotten a break from the federal government for paying state and local taxes. \nThink of it as a kind of rebate \u2014 courtesy of Washington \u2014 that ultimately helps state and local governments pay for important things, like schools, among other things. \nRepublicans now want to cut that discount, getting rid of the income and sales tax deductions and putting a $10,000 cap on the deduction for property taxes. \n\"This bill is going to make it more painful for residents to increase local property taxes to pay for public schools,\" says John Friedman, an associate professor of economics at Brown University. \nOn average, nearly half of public schools' funding (45 percent) comes from local taxes, often property taxes. In the past, when locals hiked these taxes to help pay for their schools, the federal government made the hike hurt less with that SALT deduction. So imagine, if Congress caps the property tax deduction, for high earners who already pay a lot \u2014 in places like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, even Texas \u2014 a new hike would hurt more than it used to. \n\"This is a really big deal for some states and no deal at all for other states. And the states that it's a really big deal for are blue states,\" says Nora Gordon of Georgetown. \"They're states with higher cost of living, higher property values and states that spend more on their state and local government.\" \nWhile local taxes provide nearly half of public school dollars, state taxes account for much of the rest (46 percent). Kim Rueben of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says states often use these sales and income taxes to help their poorest schools. \n\"The money from the state ends up helping to prop up school districts that have less ability to raise money from the property tax,\" she says. Getting rid of these deductions, Rueben says, will make state-level taxes more painful for some and, again, could make it harder to raise money for schools in the future. \nImportant context: All this is happening with many school districts still reeling from the Great Recession. According to a recent analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, after adjusting for inflation, \"twenty-nine states provided less overall state funding per student in the 2015 school year than in the 2008 school year, before the recession took hold.\" Higher education \nThe two tax bills are farther apart when it comes to higher education. \nIn the House: fewer tuition benefits \nWe've heard a lot about graduate students' reaction to the proposal to tax their tuition waivers as income. \nAs Ariana Figueroa reported for NPR: \n\"Many grad students \u2014 especially in Ph.D. programs \u2014 receive tuition waivers in exchange for teaching classes or doing research. Under current law, that money isn't taxed as income. But the House bill calls for those tuition waivers to be counted as income and subjected to income taxes. \nThat means graduate students would be paying taxes on money they never receive.\" \nThe House bill also cuts or reduces other higher education tax benefits: The Hope Scholarship Credit The Lifetime Learning Credit and tuition deduction The deduction on interest for those repaying student loans The American Opportunity Tax Credit, which students and families can use to offset college tuition payments, is limited to exclude part-time and graduate students, although it is also extended for a fifth year. \nTogether, the axed benefits are worth about $6.5 billion a year to students and families, according to the American Council on Education. \nThe Senate bill doesn't include any of the above. \nState funding for public higher education may also be in jeopardy, for the same reasons we discussed above \u2014 a consequence of getting rid of the deductions for SALT. Scaling back, or cutting federal discounts to taxpayers may cause a squeeze on funding for state universities and colleges. \nPrivate college penalties \nBoth public and private colleges have expressed concern that fewer people are going to be taking the charitable deduction, because of the increase in the standard deduction. They're worried this will lead, in turn, to less money in donations. The American Council on Education estimates about $100 billion less a year in donations across all nonprofits. \nThere are also some provisions in the House and Senate bills that target private colleges specifically. One provision would levy a tax on investment gains for a small group of private colleges that have very large endowments on a per-student basis. Currently, this money grows tax-free thanks to the colleges' nonprofit status. \nThis affects about 65 private colleges with extremely large endowments. But even more colleges are worried about it, says Terry Hartle of the American Council on Education. \n\"Even though public universities are not affected by the endowment tax, they are very much opposed to it, for fear it would set a precedent that would be applied to them in the future.\" \nCulture war? \nThe tax plans, which passed on party lines in both the House and Senate, are aligned with a broader Republican agenda. On the K-12 side, cuts that impact the source of public school funding are coming hand in hand with special tax benefits for families with means to put aside money for private school tuition. \nOn the higher education side, Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and adviser to the Trump campaign, told Bloomberg that Republicans are going after university endowments because \"universities have become playpens of the left.\" Amplifying that point, a recent Pew Research Center poll showed there is a sharply rising partisan gap on higher education, with 58 percent of Republicans saying colleges have a negative effect on the country, while 72 percent of Democrats say they have a positive impact.

For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically. \nHistorically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different. \nYou can find out more details about why steam has decided to stop taking Bitcoin payments over at their website at the link below.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roland hutchinson  bitcoin", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "valve", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:54.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c7bd4a58bbfc3f07e8a6ad6cdffecb369c4a5613", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCnE1NY5uyHL1bpi_s8TC.jW0IT15J6VpgEuqaEIdb4eUrf_qqZE2ZLNmaoUKsG3cDD3XHuWl1jLdnJL7pMfrEwVJFpbNfLUFKqzUtfaSkicmtEzYG0w3IfRtTqEzgooQ-", "site_full": "passionford.com", "site": "passionford.com", "site_section": "https://passionford.com/forum/ford-car-forums-listed-by-model-5/", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Ford car Forums listed by Model. - PassionFord - Ford Focus, Escort &amp; RS Forum Discussion", "title": "fiesta mk6? engine swap options", "title_full": "fiesta mk6? engine swap options - PassionFord - Ford Focus, Escort & RS Forum Discussion", "published": "2017-12-07T04:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "549ac8d2174df348f9cf594672540b57486feb8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCnE1NY5uyHL1bpi_s8TC.jW0IT15J6VpgEuqaEIdb4eUrf_qqZE2ZLNmaoUKsG3cDD3XHuWl1jLdnJL7pMfrEwVJFpbNfLUFKqzUtfaSkicmtEzYG0w3IMFiG9_OPiQnrVJMrEMZMPg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "studabear", "published": "2017-12-07T09:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I would expect plenty of fabrication to be required to fit the 5cyl turbo engine and corresponding gearbox.

Frye - Photo courtesy of Southwick Fire Chief Russell Anderson prev next comments A Western Massachusetts fire chief described as the \u201cconsummate professional\u201d was battling a two-alarm chimney fire with his firefighter son by his side when he collapsed and died yesterday, a fellow chief from a neighboring town told the Herald.\nChief Stephen P. Frye, 59, collapsed fighting the fire on Southampton Road in Montgomery Tuesday night after a call for a chimney fire came in at about 11:08 p.m., according to Department of Fire Safety spokeswoman Jennifer Mieth.\n\u201cThe concern, clearly, is for his family,\u201d Easthampton fire Chief David A. Motter said. \u201cHis son was on the hose line with his father when he collapsed. It\u2019s a tight-knit family, they all live on the same street.\u201d\nFrye was rushed to nearby Bay State Noble Hospital in Westfield, where he was pronounced dead, Mieth said.\nHe had worked with the Montgomery Fire Department since 1993 and served as chief for the past 13 years, Mieth said. He is survived by his wife and two adult children, a son and a daughter.\n\u201cHe was the best, he was the absolute best, you couldn\u2019t ask for a better person,\u201d said a woman who identified herself as Frye\u2019s sister-in-law and said the family is devastated by the loss. \u201cHe would give you the shirt off his back, he was the best of the best of the best.\u201d\nMotter said he worked with Frye last year on an unusual midwinter brush fire and said the neighboring chief\u2019s only concern was for the safety of residents of Montgomery, a town of fewer than 1,000 residents located near Springfield.\n\u201cHe was a consummate professional,\u201d Motter said. \u201cHe wanted to make sure the right message got out to residents and you could see how well-respected he was in the town.\u201d\nThe fire destroyed the home, but the residents inside were able to escape unharmed, Mieth said, adding an investigation determined the blaze to be an accidental chimney fire.\nFrye\u2019s is the second fire-related firefighter death this year.

Can you just explain to me how all these people got together and came up with this plot against Roy Moore? ... I don't know if there's like a conference call that Mitch McConnell and radical homosexuals are on, but it would be fascinating to hear that.\" \"When you have false allegations that are generated by The Washington Post , there tends to be a pile-on,\" Porter said. \"That's how a lynch mob works.\" \nCooper noted that Moore has spoken about abortion and gun rights, then asked \"where the judge stands on a number of issues that he's spoken of in the past but not as much recently.\" Porter said she didn't know if Moore still believes that homosexual conduct should be illegal, that 9/11 may have happened because \"we've distanced ourselves from God,\" that U.S. Muslims shouldn't be allowed to serve in Congress, or that Barack Obama was born outside the U.S. \n\"You know, you can ridicule Biblical beliefs if you want, but it's not going to fly in Alabama,\" Porter said. \"I'm not ridiculing,\" Cooper said, \"I'm giving you quotes of exactly what your candidate has said, you're the spokesperson, and you ... seem either not to know what his positions are or unwilling to actually tell me what his positions are.\" Watch the entire interview, including Cooper's suggestion that Porter \u2014 from Ohio \u2014 is carpetbagging and lots of talk about the Bible, the Constitution, and Sharia law.

A couple of weeks ago, Frederick and I had a chance to have a mini getaway, where we liked one restaurant so much that we went there twice. If you live in the Bay Area, you have probably visited Lake Tahoe at least once for the snow experience. In my humble opinion, Lake Tahoe is an awesome place to visit anytime of the year. Whether it is warm weather in summer where you can hire a boathouse or have an exciting parasailing experience, or cold weather in winter for fun snow activities. \nSo there we were, in early November, where the snow has yet to come, but the weather is cold enough that you want a hot cocoa while strolling around the heavenly downtown area in the early evening. We stayed at The Ridge Tahoe Resort where we could explore their unique and newly renovated areas. Check out the room. \nThe Ridge Tahoe staff really made sure we felt really comfortable and welcome. Each room comes with its own living room, kitchen, dining table, washer and dryer! They really had thought of every luxury. The view is simply stunning and I couldn\u2019t stop admiring the gorgeous sunrise vistas from our room. \nWhat\u2019s even more fun about staying here is that the property provides awesome facilities that the whole family can enjoy. They have everything you need from an indoor/outdoor swimming pool, spa and fitness center, movie theater, kid\u2019s corner, to a games room, arcades, miniature golf, hiking, and a sky lift. \nI\u2019m going to go through some of the highlights and try not to write 800 paragraphs about each of these experiences \u2013 because I easily can\u2026 and it may end up happening anyway. #wordlover \nOUR ITINERARY: \nDay 1 : We had dinner at the Hungry Bear Restaurant which is a restaurant at the Ridge Tahoe. It features wonderful menu options cooked by their inventive chef for a stylish experience in a relaxed atmosphere. \nOn the menu you will find seafood, steak, pasta and other favorites which the whole family can enjoy. We ordered the salmon salad, which was fresh and mouthwatering, and absolutely delicious. It was so good that we ended up ordering more to take home. \n\nDay 2 : We started the day with a hike and got the opportunity to enjoy the sunrise. The weather was so fantastic \u2013 a bit crispy yet light and refreshing \u2013 the perfect morning weather. \nJust before noon, we had a chance to experience the largest cruising vessel in South Lake Tahoe, the MS. Dixie II \u2013 a local favorite. The boat can fit 500 passengers and has great dining options available. The 2-hour tour was totally worth every penny. It\u2019s the best of both worlds: the beauty of a pristine mountain lake setting combined with the thrill of a new adventure. \nRight after our boat tour, we decided to explore the area further and went to Tallac Historic Site. This beautiful area is made up of a series of buildings that encompass the history of the area is remarkable detail. The Pope Estate, Baldwin Estate, and Valhalla give you a glimpse into the lavish way of life of the rich and famous that spent their summers at Lake Tahoe. Sadly, we did not get a chance to explore the inside since they were closed for the season and only open in the summer. However, you can still bike and stroll along the gardens, and take some pictures. \nSince we did not get a chance to explore Tallac, we decided to stop by Heavenly Village. Anyone who has visited Lake Tahoe will know Heavenly Village, which has made quite a name for itself. This fun area is not just for tourists who enjoy shopping and eating out, but also for locals who enjoy outdoor ice skating or watching a movie. \nFor dinner, we went to Jimmy\u2019s Restaurant based on some recommendations\u2026 and I fell in love with everything they put on the table, especially their grilled octopus. It really blew my mind! It was served with roast potatoes, taramasalata, and haricot verts \u2013 absolute heaven on a plate! \nDay 3 : After spending 2 days with the spectacular view, I was not ready to go home, so we decided to go for another hike in the morning, for fresh air and some fun activities. \nI had enjoyed Jimmy\u2019s so much the night before that I wanted to go back there for lunch before we headed home. Thankfully, the hubs agreed and off to Jimmy\u2019s we went for another dose of delicious. The restaurant, located at rear of the Landing Resort & Spa, faces gorgeous Lake Tahoe and lures you in with a friendly and casual vibe. We ordered the same grilled octopus because it was so damn good! And I\u2019m still dreaming about it now as I write this post. It is a definite must try. \nWell, who says visiting Tahoe for a short holiday is not fun.

It\u2019s been 22 years since the Senate passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act with overwhelming bipartisan support, formally recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. But no action was taken to move the U.S. Embassy there. Until now.\nKnowing that the peace process has long been stalled between the Palestinians and our greatest ally in the Middle East, it was long overdue to try something new. Our president \u2014 a change agent \u2014 expressed this yesterday: \u201cWe cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s action puts Iran on notice. The world\u2019s primary state sponsor of terrorism has repeatedly threatened to destroy Israel, and provides support to the terrorists who constantly attack the Jewish state, creating instability throughout the region. It is no accident that Arab nations such as Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states now quietly cooperate with Israel. They also know where their interest lies.\nStrong, unequivocal U.S. support for Israel means that the Palestinians have to consider reality. Israel is not going away, and as with many Arab nations, an accommodation is in their interest.\nYesterday on my Herald Radio show, U.S. Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) told me, \u201cThis is a pledge that President Trump made, not just as president but as a candidate, and it improves his stature around the world when he carries through on the pledges that he makes; it tells our allies and our enemies both that this president is a man of his word and he will fulfill the promises and commitments that he makes.\u201d\nBanks added, \u201cFor 3,000 years Jerusalem has been the center of the Jewish people and this declaration that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and our recognition of such is a powerful American statement to those around the world who are paying attention to our actions.\u201d\nUnder the Obama administration, U.S. relations with Israel hit an all-time low. We recall Obama and scores of Democrats \u2014 including our own U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 snubbing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s historic address before Congress over the Iran nuclear deal.\nBut peace with terrorists doesn\u2019t come from weakness and concessions. It comes from strength. But now that a pro-Israel president is managing our foreign policy, Trump is quickly repairing this vital geopolitical relationship that is critical to our short- and long-term security in the region. And he is letting the world know we are serious about the Middle East again.\nAdriana Cohen is a Boston Herald columnist, radio host and syndicated columnist.

On the top of it its healthy too. \nAunthentic recipe of Appe/Paddu/Paniyaram uses idli/dosa batter. You can use anything for a batter like rawa, oats, whole wheat, besan or any other multigrain flour. This time I am sharing the recipe with idli/dosa batter. \nThe best part of this dish is that you can add any vegetable you like or don\u2019t like it will turn up tasty. So, its best to add healthy vegetables like lauki/bottle gourd/dudhi which kids usually don\u2019t like but is very healthy. This time I have added onion, carrots and capsicum. \nI love South Indian dishes a lot that I can have them daily.

The company is US based hence the shares are on Etrade.com.\nWhats the best way to sell these shares and transfer the proceeds back to Australia? (So that i can have this more readily available to contribute towards mortgage deposit.. which will be sometime early next year). But I'm looking to sell this asap, as the stock prices are good.\nOptions Ive explored sofar:\n1. Sell & wire transfer from Etrade directly into my everyday AUD account. Which seems least cost effective considering Etrade would charge something like $27 + 300 basic points (3%) of transacted amount. And their exchange rate is not the best.\n2. Create a foreign currency USD account in Australia and transfer from Etrade to that account. And then exchange USD to AUD when the conversion is good. EDIT: Etrade advised that they'd only charge the Wire transfer charge of about $27.\nNow, I bank with ANZ who apparently dont provide USD accounts for individuals. anyone recommend a bank/account?\n3. Sell the shares and Wire the proceeds to OFX's account and then transfer to my local AUD account. (no fees from OFX seems too good to be true). But OFX want a \"Sale of Shares document\" which Etrade customer support claim has no clue of.\nI'm sure there's someone out there has done this before with less pain. Option 2 seems promising & simple.Should I be concerned of any hidden costs associated with Option 2?\nIs there another option I haven't considered?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:57.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "da2bbd876864bd9e118ddd5bee5de7373a0972ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTIjXRLn6u6SVT2.lupsJDmkvPOEDxJqFGSCFkNdeJElEj3_AN3E4bE6GZ9zd0Jb9ogMREV3PW7SlJ_9JtwwOg6pjWp5NU4cqMcoz884TVSYlSLOuhc3wlZCZCyMW_Mtn02uVIGSgfxHw--", "site_full": "www.aussiestockforums.com", "site": "aussiestockforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.aussiestockforums.com/forums/international-markets.6/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "International Markets | Aussie Stock Forums", "title": "Selling US shares on ETrade and money back to Australia", "title_full": "Selling US shares on ETrade and money back to Australia | Aussie Stock Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T15:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "https://www.aussiestockforums.com/styles/aussiestockforums/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bbe89b7d5fdb191a90fb44b70f90d422bf1abe16", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTIjXRLn6u6SVT2.lupsJDmkvPOEDxJqFGSCFkNdeJElEj3_AN3E4bE6GZ9zd0Jb9ogMREV3PW7SlJ_9JtwwOg6pjWp5NU4cqMcoz884TVSYlSLOuhc3wlZCZCyMW_Mtn1fL3QB5to9sA--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "minwa", "published": "2017-12-07T16:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Option 2 I believe only HSBC and Citi offer personal foreign currency accounts. You still get ~1-3% haircut on exchanging back to AUD when you eventually convert. You are not really saving anything over option 1, the exchange rate is from the banks side, not ETrade, which you have still have to suffer when you eventually convert. Only upside (which could backfire depending on your AUDUSD picking skills/luck) of this option over 1 is you can choose when to convert back to AUD.\nThe best way I know of is option 2 with an added step of opening an IB account. Etrade withdraw USD to foreign currency account, then send it to IB brokerage, convert USD to AUD in IB then withdraw to local bank account. This avoids the currency haircut.\nOFX seems to lower the haircut to 100 points. Pretty sure the no fees is correct, they make their margin on the haircut. This could be less hassle than using IB except you still get exchange loss.\nYou have to decide how much are you actually converting and is it really worth opening a new bank account and possibly new brokerage just to save on the conversion ?
