My experience with her proved that Dr. Irene Chua doesn't want to be questioned or tailor her care to your beliefs. During my birth, Dr. Irene Chua did the quickest option possible because it was clear she didn't want to be there in the early hours in the morning. I'll spare you the lengthy details, but it's important to know that the bedside manner she displayed in her office QUICKLY went out the window. To add insult to injury, Dr. Irene Chua's follow up care was appalling - terrible (or no) instructions, mean comments and a real lack of sympathy. I have spoken to other doctors in Singapore about how I was treated and they were shocked. Shocked. I know lots of people have had good births with Dr. Irene Chua, and I do think that's possible, but it's going to be if you blindly trust her and only do exactly what she wants.

He expressed regrets that some people squandered the nation\u2019s enormous wealth without providing basic facilities, such as water, electricity and good roads. President Buhari spoke yesterday at the Emir of Kano Muhammad Sanusi 11\u2019s palace during his two-day visit to Kano. The trip will be rounded off today. \nThe President also pardoned 500 inmates of Kurmawa Prison who got cash donations to start a new life. He said the gesture was part of his administration\u2019s effort to decongest the prisons. The President said: \u201cFrom 1999 to 2014, the wealth of this country was lavishly squandered by those in the position of authority. Those who have looted the treasury will best be judged by God.\u201d President Buhari also told the Emir of Kano that he had seen a lot since he joined politics in 2003, adding: \u201cAs a politician, I really tasted the pains of seeking elective office. \u201cSince I joined politics in 2003, I contested for president three times but I could not get it right until the fourth attempt in 2015. I was in court for 30 months, challenging the 2007 election and in 2011, I also spent 16 months in court.\u201d He urged Nigerians to understand the difference between military and democratic dispensations, saying: \u201cWhen I was the military head of state, I arrested many people and jailed them for alleged corruption and in the end, I also ended in jail.\u201d The President added that \u201cit is not easy for us to surmount all the obstacles against us; but knowing that the road to a promised land appeared rough, but all I want from Nigerians is to be patient that there will be light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d Buhari recalled his sustained cordial relationship with Kano emirate council, saying the Emirate contributed tremendously to his life, \u201cKano emirate council has contributed a lot to my life. Whatever I became in my life, I always consult the Kano emirate council.\u201d At the Prison, he said: \u201cI am pleased with this visit and I have learnt a bit more about the conditions of the prisons and inmates. \u201cThis building in front of us was built since 1910. Rehabilitation of prisoners and training of inmates is very important to us and we would continue to invest more on this. \u201cI asked one of the inmates (released) how old he was and he told me he is only 19 years old. \u201cIf we have people of 18 and 19 years in the prison, and there is no continuous training, then their lives will be completely destroyed. We will invest more in education and vocational training,\u2019\u2019 he said. The 500 inmates granted pardon, including men and women, were drawn from various prisons in Kano State, including Kurmawa Prisons, which has 1,398 inmates as opposed to 750, the established capacity. On security, Buhari said his administration had recorded significant success in crushing the Boko Haram insurgency in the Northeast and restoring peace and harmony in the region and other parts of the country. President Buhari added that the North was important to the country, saying \u201cif there is peace and stability in the North, there will be peace and stability in the whole country and if there is a problem in the region it will affect the entire country.\u201d The Emir of Kano said the palace was happy to receive President Buhari who he described as a Kano indigene. \u201cWe are welcoming the President of Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari to Kano, even though as he spoke earlier that the Palace is his home and Kano is his hometown because of the number of votes he got from Kano during the last election. \u201cAt all times he contested for the presidency, the people of Kano always voted for him massively. When it was perceived that he was defeated at those contests, Kano people still stood by him and voted for him, even though in Kano, they he that won and he won. The people of Kano are promising people. We are praying for you. \u201cMay God give you good health; may the God almighty see you through. All Nigerians have seen the rapid development that is being witnessed in your administration, especially on security and particularly on the fight against corruption. We also witness your tremendous effort in reviving agriculture, education and power with the recession the world is witnessing. We shall continue to pray, we shall continue to give our own advice. Host Governor Abdullahi Ganduje renamed the Gingiyu Specialist Hospital as Muhammadu Buhari Specialist Hospital. He said the hospital was named after President Buhari because of his selfless and pragmatic leadership style which has earned him international acceptance, particularly, his fight against corruption. He said the two hospitals inaugurated by the President were abandoned for over 10 years, but were completed by his administration at N8 billion, with state-of-the-art equipment. Ganduje noted that the hospitals would stop health tourism abroad. President Buhari was received by a huge crowd which followed his convoy from Malam Aminu International Airport to all the places he visited, chanting \u201c sai  Buhari,  sai  Ganduje\u201d. People lined up the streets waving at Buhari\u2019s long convoy. The President inaugurated two general Hospitals, Panshekara/ Madobi Underpass, CBN Quarters Road, inspected 2000 affordable housing unit under construction and laid the foundation of the the Kano Economic City, among others. At the Muhammadu Buhari Specialist hospital, the President said: \u201cThe commissioning of this hospital is meant for Nigerians and I am happy that am seeing how our government of APC is bringing change faster to the people that voted us into power. This hospital, the first of its kind in the region, is a true reflection of what our government is all about. Today before returning to Abuja, the President will inspect the Fullmark Rice Mill Company at Kwanar Gunduwawa, and Gezawa Oil Mill, the largest oil mill in Africa at Tokarawa Industrial Estate, both on Hadeja Road. Buhari is expected to meet with the Ulamas and hold an interactive session with community leaders and politicians before returning to Abuja. \n\n\n\nFeel Free To Comments Here...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammadu buhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kano muhammad sanusi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdullahi ganduje", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boko haram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ganduje", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gezawa oil mill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurmawa prisons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokarawa industrial estate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fullmark rice mill company", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kano economic city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kano state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal republic of nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abuja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emirate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malam aminu international airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kwanar gunduwawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panshekara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hadeja road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurmawa prison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northeast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gingiyu specialist hospital", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:25.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "77833cdcafa6a21aa2654b39f03d6d61845d074d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTaIC9fTIpa3viWoUXCHaI7aDOFn5w33AWZ6OBN3uVDNnXMxh3NSDghUusgaUkVhp3qQnACnfruqFI2vmBGsJLEtkI6zZYY1QKpg3KDA_1Rqw--", "site_full": "oilvoice.com", "site": "oilvoice.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/JobMarketplace", "site_categories": ["job_search", "jobs", "business", "green_solutions"], "section_title": "OilVoice", "title": "REVIT SPECIALIST - (MODELER/DRAFTER/DESIGN) - SINGAPORE", "title_full": "REVIT SPECIALIST - (MODELER/DRAFTER/DESIGN) - SINGAPORE", "published": "2017-12-07T05:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://oilvoice.com/Content/logos/oilvoicelogo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "77833cdcafa6a21aa2654b39f03d6d61845d074d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTaIC9fTIpa3viWoUXCHaI7aDOFn5w33AWZ6OBN3uVDNnXMxh3NSDghUusgaUkVhp3qQnACnfruqFI2vmBGsJLEtkI6zZYY1QKpg3KDA_1Rqw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T05:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "REVIT SPECIALIST - (MODELER/DRAFTER/DESIGN) - SINGAPORE", "text": "Job Title: REVIT Specialist (BIM Modeler/Drafter/Designer) Starting Date: ASAP (no later than end of December) Contract Duration: 4 months (up to 12 months) My client is currently seeking for an REVIT SPECIALIST (Modeler, Drafter, Design) for a desalination project to provide technical support and services to end customers' base.

FILE PHOTO | JARED NYATAYA | NMG \nEarly last month, 65,000 kilogrammes of unused and expired medicines \u2013 among other pharmaceutical waste - from various hospitals, chemists and clinics across the country were destroyed by industry regulators. \nThe destruction of the products worth over Sh1.29 million was done at the Envirosafe Limited incinerator at the Export Processing Zone, Athi River. \nThe Pharmacy and Poisons Board (PPB) and the Pharmaceutical Society of Kenya (PSK) in collaboration with the Kenya Ports Authority collected the products in a span of one year. The National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) was also involved. \nAccording to PSK, controlled medicines meant for disposal can lead to deaths if consumed hence the destruction. \nBut a lack of public awareness on how to dispose of expired drugs obscures the public eye which ought to act as a watchdog when inappropriate disposal takes place. \nSources of unwanted pharmaceuticals range from unsolicited medicines especially in situations of duress like wars, famine, natural disasters or when authorities seek for help from well-wishers or expiry of medicinal supplies that are routinely used. \nPoor quality products which may be mouldy, adulterated or inappropriate for human and animal consumption are also a factor for disposal, said PSK president Philip Mwaniki.

These have led to deaths.\u201d \nHe added: \u201cMost public facilities do not have the capacity to destroy medicinal waste at the required standard that assures safe disposal.\u201d \nThere are more than 10,000 health facilities in Kenya, ranging from the smallest clinic to the largest referral hospitals under public and private hospitals. \nThese health facilities generate medicinal waste through routine use and the expiry of supplies. \nBut in most instances, expired medicinal supplies are kept away probably in a store or simply under a shade. \nSometimes it is just heaped somewhere within the health facility to create room for storage of new useful supplies due to shortage of space. \nThe biggest challenge for health facilities is lack of space to serve as storage for waste. \n\u201cThe way it is being done in all public facilities is causing more harm and pollution than just keeping them locked up somewhere,\u201d said Dr Mwaniki. \nPharmaceuticals are largely destroyed at very high temperatures (at more than 1,200\u00b0C), according to PSK. \nThat means that for one to incinerate pharmaceuticals, he or she needs special incinerators that can attain such temperatures and with adequate control of emissions. \nThe brick and motor incinerators doting most public health facilities can hardly generate high temperatures (of over the required 1200\u00b0C) for proper incineration of drugs, most of them can do about 300\u00b0C. \nThe price of poor pharmaceutical waste disposal will be borne by generations for decades to come as harmful toxic pollutants from low temperature incinerators and open pits found in most public facilities get lodged in the air, deposited on land and consumed by people over time. \nThese are known to cause cancers \u2013 a menace that is on the rise, Dr Mwaniki said. \nCostly to dispose \nExpired pharmaceuticals cost a lot of money, and counties have hundreds of tonnes of waste. \nTo dispose of the expired commodities, a responsible pharmacy professional and representatives of a waste disposal company should be involved. \nThe cost for disposing of one kilogramme of pharmaceutical waste, for instance, used to range between Sh200 to Sh400 in the 1990s, based on the type of waste, but the cost has since come down to about Sh25 to Sh30. \nAnti-cancer drugs, for instance, need over 3,000\u00b0C to be safely destroyed. Apart from the Kenya Medical and Research Institute, there is no other public facility with such capacity. \nKenyatta National Hospital (KNH), the largest public referral facility in the eastern Africa, for instance, has a 1,700\u00b0C incinerator according to Louis Machogu, thus it does not meet the required recommendation. \nDr Machogu is a PSK National Governing Council member and the PSK Nairobi Branch Interim Chairman. He is also the founder of the Haltons Pharmacy chain. \nDr Machogu said the private sector has not prioritised incinerators as it \u201ctries as it has arrangements with suppliers to return products six months to expiry\u201d. \nApproval must be sought \n\u201cIncinerators cost a lot of money to run and no private hospital wants to have it on its books. Outsourcing is what they do,\u201d said Dr Machogu. \nDr Mwaniki said, however, that in order for a country or organisation to dispose of harmful pharmaceuticals approval must be sought from the appropriate authority. \n\u201cIn our country, authority must be sort from the Ministry of Health through the drug regulatory authority,\u201d he said. \nBefore devolution the Health principal secretary who is also the ministry\u2019s accounting officer was in charge of commissioning the disposal, according to PSK. \nBut with the formation of counties the PS is now only in charge of national referral facilities like KNH, Mathare Mental Hospital, the National Spinal Injury Hospital, and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. \n\u201cThe bulk of public health facilities which include dispensaries, health centres and sub-county and county hospitals were put under counties. Therefore, the County Chief of Health (CoH) should take up that mantle. There is a big gap here as our CoHs are not resourced to destroy expired medicines,\u201d said Dr Mwaniki. \nHe added: \u201cThere is need for funding, necessary expertise, human resources, professional time, space, equipment, material and available disposal options for proper disposal of medicinal supplies. This is essential before practical steps can be taken to start disposal in counties.\u201d \nAlso, cost estimates of expired medicines need to be made as they have an impact on financial reporting and accountability for both public and private facilities. \nExpired pharmaceuticals do not represent a serious threat to public health or to the environment if stored appropriately, said Dr Machogu. \nHowever, he added, improper disposal may be hazardous as it can lead to not only contamination of water supplies or local sources used by communities and wildlife but also pilfering and theft from stockpiles of waste drugs may result in their being diverted to the market for resale and misuse. \nChildren \nExpired drugs may also land in the hands of scavengers and children if a landfill is insecure. \nA landfill is a constructed pit purposely for disposal of waste. \nThe consequences of inefficient and insecure sorting and disposal of medical waste may allow drugs to be diverted for resale to the general public, hence rent-seeking businessmen may alter expiry dates on vials, packing materials and bottles and hoodwink the public into buying the unsafe medicine. \n\u201cIn our country scavenging in unprotected insecure landfills is a hazard driven by poverty and pure greed for a quick kill,\u201d said Dr Machogu, a pharmacist by profession. \n\u201cMost pharmaceuticals that are past their expiry date become less efficacious and some may become more toxic leading to adverse drug reactions.\u201d \nSome categories of expired drugs or defective disposal practices carry a public health risk. \nControlled substances like narcotics and psychotropic drugs, for instance, require tight security and control to avoid theft and resale in the market. \nDr Machogu said that there are instances where drug addicts set up homes in disposal sites when a government institution or hospital inappropriately disposes of expired dugs in the hope of landing substances to inhale, inject or sell at a profit. \n\u201cIf pharmaceuticals must be discarded directly to a landfill, then they must be covered immediately with a large quantity of municipal waste,\u201d Dr Machogu said. \nLandfills, he said, must be constructed in a way that minimises the possibility of underground seepage to avoid waste entering an aquifer, surface water or drinking water system. \nNon-biodegradable antibiotics, anti-cancer drugs and disinfectants should not be disposed of into the sewage system as they may kill bacteria necessary for the treatment of sewage hence endangering the ecosystem through growth of undesirable microbes. \n\u201cThe public should not flush expired anti-cancer drugs into watercourses as they may damage aquatic life or contaminate drinking water,\u201d he said. \nDon't burn \nBurning pharmaceuticals at low temperatures or in open containers also spells doom as it results in the release of toxic pollutants into the air. \n\u201cThis should be avoided as it may lead to the proliferation of undesirable medicinal conditions like Asthma, Bronchitis and a host of other allergic manifestations.\u201d \nDumping into a county site is not a good idea either. \nThe Dandora dumping site continues to bear the brunt of receiving all sorts of waste including toxic electronics and harmful pharmaceutical products. \nAntibiotics dumped at the site may seep into the food chain through being consumed by animals such as chicken feeding on the dumpsite, as well as soil and water contamination leading to unintended exposure by humans and animals to the drugs. \n\u201cDumping antibiotics in communal pits might lead to drug resistance to microbes like Vibrio Cholera, especially in cases of poor human waste management,\u201d said Dr Machogu. \n\u201cCounty governments, their environmental and health departments together with the pharmacy board should look into this. We as professionals and the private sector have capacity to support.\u201d \nDump sites not ideal \nOpen dump sites like Dandora are not ideal for disposal of medicinal supplies. Experts advise for highly professional sanitary landfills, which are dug to a level where they do not reach the aquifer to avoid water contamination. \nThese should ideally be located away from human settlements and properly secured. \nThe government has a return-back mechanism for some supplies such as vaccines which are returned to sub-county public facilities for onward disposal.Most public health facilities have regular incinerators, a sewerage system and an open pit for disposal of general waste. \nSave for a few syrups like multivitamins and paracetamol, which can be disposed through the sewerage system, these county facilities can hardly be used for disposal of antibiotics, anti-cancers and other controlled medicines. \nDr Mwaniki said there is a need to develop a national policy on the disposal of medicinal supplies, which will then be followed up by guidelines on how to dispose of them. \nEach county should then be required to establish a high capacity incinerator for disposal of medicinal waste. \n\u201cIt is not just about disposal but safe disposal of medicinal waste. More harm comes from substandard medicinal waste management,\u201d said Dr Machogu. advertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "philip mwaniki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moi teaching", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oimeke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mwaniki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "machogu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared nyataya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louis machogu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kenya ports authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psk national governing council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national environmental management authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya medical and research institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national spinal injury hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "envirosafe limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mathare mental hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "referral hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haltons pharmacy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenyatta national hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psk nairobi branch interim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poisons board", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "athi river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eldoret", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "export processing zone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:25.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "30a6447f0db1dea8260d7960e673b256f9f94cee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4UEkjK18.G3fXvo4aOxQtcla75Rh91sclVzCJgW9xhOK0ImH7PI9BV1aEevlkPyhbzQfrR4DGd5eBfpE4an.prOvrcy15WxIg8ZPrEhBHYQ--", "site_full": "amarillo.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://amarillo.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist amarillo | personals search", "title": "Very cute and insanely tight clean girl here looking for a hung -

This comes on the back of an intensified service drive by airport management and staff. Scores are based on independent passenger surveys administered by Airports Council International. \u201cThis improvement is a significant achievement over a relatively short time,\u201d said Bongiwe Pityi , gm of Ortia. \u201cNo organisation can run successfully without collaboration from strategic partners. In any airport, only a small fraction of the people working there are actually employed by the airport company. This means that the passenger experience depends on all of us being aligned and striving to put the traveller first in everything we do,\u201d said Pityi. An ASQ score is determined by factors that enhance the passenger\u2019s experience. Areas that achieved significant improvement at Ortia were overall satisfaction, waiting time at passport/ID inspection, and restaurant/eating facilities. Speed of baggage delivery, courtesy and helpfulness of airport and airline check-in staff, cleanliness of the terminals, and a feeling of being safe and secure also saw improvement. Gauteng MEC for Transport, Ismail Vadi added: \u201cI cannot overemphasise the strategic national importance of airports as sovereign assets and as enablers of economic activity.

So in those first days he made himself a promise: trust no one, document everything. \nA newly minted teacher with a reputation for secular ideas, he had lost his university job. \nHe found another calling. \n\u201cMy job as a historian requires an unbiased approach which I am going to adhere to and keep my personal opinion to myself,\u201d he wrote on that first day, June 18, 2014. \nMosul Eye became one of the outside world\u2019s main sources of news about the Islamic State fighters, their atrocities and their transformation of the city into a grotesque shadow of itself. \nDuring Friday sermons, Mohammed feigned enthusiasm. He collected propaganda to post online later. He drank tea at the hospital, fishing for information. \nMuch of what he collected went on the blog. Other details he kept in his computer, for fear of giving away his identity. Someday, he promised, he would write history with them. \nThe most sensitive details initially came from two old friends: a doctor and a high school dropout who had joined an Islamic State intelligence unit. \nMohammed\u2019s information sometimes included photos of the fighters and commanders, complete with biographies surreptitiously pieced together during the course of his normal life \u2014 that of an out-of-work scholar living at home. \n\u201cI used the two characters, the two personalities to serve each other,\u201d he said. He expanded into a Facebook page and a Twitter feed to parcel out information at a time when little news was escaping. \nIntelligence agencies made contact as well and he rebuffed them. \n\u201cI am not a spy or a journalist,\u201d he would say. \u201cI tell them this: If you want the information, it\u2019s published and it\u2019s public for free. Take it.\u201d \nIn March 2015, his catalogue of horrors got to him. \n\u201cI was super ready to die,\u201d Mohammed said. \u201cI was so tired of worrying about myself, my family, my brothers. I am not alive to worry, but I am alive to live this life. I thought: I am done.\u201d \nHe cut his hair short, shaved his beard and pulled on a bright red sweater. His closest friend joined him. \nThey drove to the banks of the Tigris blasting forbidden music. They shared a carafe of tea. Heedless of people picnicking nearby, Mohammed lit a cigarette\u2014banned by IS. Somehow, incredibly, he wasn\u2019t caught. \n\u201cAt that moment I felt like I was given a new life.\u201d \nHe resumed what he had taken to calling his duty. He grew out his hair and beard, put the shortened trousers back on. \nHe tested out different voices, Christian, Muslim. Sometimes he indicated he was gone, other times that he was still in the city. \nFinally, after leaving Mosul a thousand times in his mind, he decided it was time to get out. \n\u201cI think I deserve life, deserve to be alive.\u201d \nA smuggler agreed to sneak him out for $1,000. Mohammed left the next day, the contents of his computer transferred overnight to a hard-drive that he packed with him. \nNo one gave him a second look during the two days and some 500 kilometres (300 miles) it took to reach Turkey. \nOnce there, Mosul Eye kept at it: via WhatsApp and Viber, from Facebook messages and long conversations with friends and relatives who had contacts within IS. From hundreds of kilometres away, his life remained consumed by events back home . \nBy mid-2016, deaths were piling up faster than he could record. The Islamic State group was on a hunt for traitors and the airstrikes were taking an increasing toll on everyone. His records grew haphazard, and he turned to Twitter to document the atrocities. In February 2017, he received asylum in Europe. \nOnly after his elder brother Ahmed was killed in a mortar strike and IS was gone from the city did Mohammed reveal his secret to a younger brother \u2014 who greeted the news with a shock of pride and happiness. His sibling spoke on condition of anonymity from his refuge in Iraq because he was fearful for his life. \n\u201cPeople in Mosul had lost hope and confidence in politicians, in everything,\u201d his brother said. Mosul Eye \u201cmanaged to show that it\u2019s possible to change the situation in the city and bring it back to life.\u201d Recent Articles", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lori hinnant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maggie michael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul eye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omar mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tigris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:26.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aff24551924d343fb441803df295f1424cd7de6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XvOP.xSLZ1wAqY9j1Yfxmk5dmGeuCdNF3CF8eCjyldJPobxOrTEh9afKqLRwMKLBQFxBlIy9vJlMz0_tc7g5sfXGn.0jTtRl8R5Uyg0jyW5jdg9X8IGwk", "site_full": "www.canadianinquirer.net", "site": "canadianinquirer.net", "site_section": "http://www.canadianinquirer.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "immigration"], "section_title": "Philippine Canadian Inquirer", "title": "SWS: Filipino families experiencing hunger up", "title_full": "SWS: Filipino families experiencing hunger up", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.canadianinquirer.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/6893104358_852957a7bf_z.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aff24551924d343fb441803df295f1424cd7de6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XvOP.xSLZ1wAqY9j1Yfxmk5dmGeuCdNF3CF8eCjyldJPobxOrTEh9afKqLRwMKLBQFxBlIy9vJlMz0_tc7g5sfXGn.0jTtRl8R5Uyg0jyW5jdg9X8IGwk", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Carlo Jacob Molina", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "SWS: Filipino families experiencing hunger up", "text": "By Carlo Jacob Molina , Philippine Canadian Inquirer on December 7, 2017 The Third Quarter 2017 SWS survey found that 11.8% or an estimated 2.7 million families experienced involuntary hunger in the past three months, posting an 2.3 percentage rise from 9.5% quarterly Hunger in June 2017. ( Photo by Feed My Starving Children (FMSC)/Flickr , CC BY 2.0 ) \nMore Filipino families said they experienced involuntary hunger at least once in the last three months, the latest Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey showed. \nThe Third Quarter 2017 SWS survey found that 11.8% or an estimated 2.7 million families experienced involuntary hunger in the past three months, posting a 2.3 percentage rise from 9.5% quarterly Hunger in June 2017. \nApproximately 11.8% or 2.2 million families said they experienced moderate hunger. The percentage rose by 1.8 points from 9.6% in September. \nWhereas, 2.1% or 493,000 families said they experienced severe hunger, up by 0.5 points 2.1% in September. \nModerate Hunger refers to those who experienced hunger \u201cOnly Once\u201d or \u201cA Few Times\u201d in the last three months, while Severe Hunger refers to those who experienced it \u201cOften\u201d or \u201cAlways\u201d in the last three months \n\u201cThe few who did not state their frequency of hunger were classified under Moderate Hunger.\u201d the SWS said. \n\u201cBoth Moderate Hunger and Severe Hunger increased between June 2017 and September 2017. Prior to this, both had been steadily declining since December 2016,\u201d it added. \nFrom June 2017 to September 2017, quarterly Hunger rose by 3.1 points among the Self-Rated Poor, from 13.6% in June to 16.7% in September. It also rose by 1.1 points among the Non-poor over the same period, going from 6.3% to 7.4%. \nHunger also increased by 2.7 points among the self-rated food-poor to 19.8 percent in September from 17.1 percent in June and 2.1 points among the not food-poor to 8 percent from 5.9 percent. \nThe quarterly hunger percentage swelled in all regions except Mindanao. \nIn Metro Manila, quarterly hunger rose by 0.4 points from 11.3% (353,000 families) in June 2017 to 11.7% in September 2017 while in Balance Luzon, it rose 5.5 points from 8.3% (645,000 families) in June to 13.8% in September. \nHunger rose by 1 point in the Visayas, from 8.7% (324,000 families) in June to 9.7% in September. However, in Mindanao, Hunger fell by 1.7 points from 11.3% (523,000 families) to 9.7% in September. \nThe Survey, conducted from September 23-27, interviewed 1,500 adult aged 18 years old and above nationwide. \nAnnual Hunger rates, or the annual averages, have a sampling error margin of \u00b11.5%.

( Photo by By Connor Mah \u2013 Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0 ) \nCALGARY \u2014 Alberta has set out its competition-based plan to reduce carbon emissions from the province\u2019s big industries, but it\u2019s raising concerns from some about jobs and costs. \nThe regulations will give companies credits if their facilities produce less than a benchmark amount of emissions, while those that exceed the threshold will have to buy offsets or pay $30 for every tonne of emissions over the limit. \n\u201cThe improved rules that we are releasing today will reward companies that use best practices and reward investment in modern and efficient facilities,\u201d said Environment Minister Shannon Phillips at a news conference in Calgary Wednesday. \n\u201cThat\u2019s how we are going to create a race to the top in Alberta, by rewarding the top performers in each sector.\u201d \nThe stakes for the regulations are high, since the large emitters they cover produce about half of all of the province\u2019s emissions. \nAlberta expects the new regulations to cut emissions by 20 million tonnes by 2020, and 50 million tonnes by 2030, equivalent to the emissions from about 11.5 million cars, said Phillips. \nCosts are also expected to be high, with the government estimating the total value of levies per year coming in at upwards of $1.2 billion annually when in full force in 2020, though offsets and credits mean the government expects to take in closer to $800 million. \nThe new structure, called the Carbon Competitiveness Incentives, comes into place Jan. 1, 2018 and applies to facilities like oilsands operations, cement plants and fertilizer production that produce more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. \nThe regulations will replace the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation currently in place, and will mean a big jump in costs, said Tim McMillan, head of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. \n\u201cIt looks like, by our calculations, about a five-fold increase in costs to our industry from the current carbon levy. And at a time when attracting capital is challenging and we\u2019re seeing increasing amounts of capital that traditionally came to Canada going to the U.S. and elsewhere, we\u2019re very sensitive to cost implications.\u201d \nThe opposition United Conservative Party also raised concerns about the plan, demanding the government provide clear estimates on how many jobs the policy could cost and pointing to a leaked memo that estimated the losses could be in the thousands. \n\u201cThe details in this document are shocking and all Albertans, especially those employed in the oil and gas sector, should be deeply concerned about how these policies will impact our economy,\u201d said UCP Opposition Leader Jason Nixon in a release. \nTo ease the transition and avoid big hits to industry, the government is phasing in the regulations, with industry paying 50 per cent of the costs next year and 75 per cent for 2019 before the full regulations take force for 2020. \nThe government has also committed to return some of industry\u2019s carbon levy back to it in the form of $1.4 billion in funding announced Tuesday. \nThe money includes $440 million specifically for steam-based oilsands operations to improve efficiencies and reduce emissions, plus money across sectors for innovation projects, energy efficiencies and loan guarantees for emission-reduction projects. \n\u201cThis whole policy was designed around the protection of jobs and ensuring companies remain competitive,\u201d said Phillips.

Good, I shall do this, I have one in the mail as we write. As for the OHM check 'good' info, into my notes.\nQuote: : i have also seen a few of the pickups on the ignition circuit go bad. you can test them at the point they come out of the case by the recoil. the smaller plugs should be 2. As in 2 OHM.. I gather. Ok. I did check the entire magneto back in august when I went thru the engine and its probably more then likely that something happened to it between then and now. Understanding that reducing the amount of 'false economy' is the goal for me and this sled here. I will check the mag again thru using the write-up in the 2009 service manual. If its dodgy, I will replace the whole shebang.. crank sensors, pull rope and all.\nQuote: : You did dump the fuel and flush the tank right? use a hanger and pull the fuel line in the tank up and inspect it for cracks along with the smart valves. you can undo the fuel pump just to the r of the steering post with just one nut and 1 plug (black and red wire) and pull it all out of the tank if needed. One of the first things I did Kel was get rid of that old stank gas and water in the tank and clean the tank spotless. However I didn't have the fuel pump/works out of the tank. Initially I used it to bilge the tank, then STOPPED realizing I risked put all that **** thru the pump. I dumped the rest out by hand. I looked at the screens in the pickup with a flashlight and I didn't see any OBVIOUS damage, but I didn't get my HANDS on them and inspect closely. I will pull the fuel pump tonight and yard it out of there and look for cracks.\nUpdate: Okay, I split the throttle quadrant and disconnected the micro-switch. Put it together, and fired it up. I let it warm up then proceeded to do my little circuit loop. It went further then it ever went, and managed to punch it a few times.. what a machine.. but around the far side of the loop it started to howl as before, only NOT as severe. So +1 on that micro switch Bud. Thank you. Not the entire solution but definitely a step in the right direction.\nI have the heat on in the garage, so after I finish writing this, it should be cool enough to take the muffler off to get to the fuel tank, and the fuel rail.\nI think Joey's advice combined with your advice concerning the fuel pickup is on the right track. Fuel system needs a very close inspection. I do NOT have a pressure gauge, but when the RPM picks up, I can watch the fuel line try to straighten out or flex, not an accurate reading I know. I will try and locate a fuel pressure setup to borrow. I noticed that the in-tank-pump has a built in return and not a looped return with a regulator on rail like a conventional EFI system. Odd to me. Like chinzy odd. Not the way I would do it but whatever.\nOn last note. The pump in the tank when running just seems to spray the return fuel all over the place.. like a.. sprinkler and I have no idea if that's even normal.. Looks wack to me.. but like I said I am new to Sled EFI and I have seen pumps with internal pressure reliefs, just not one so.. flamboyant I guess.. I will update as I get crap pulled apart.\nThanks again for helping me with this.

Their economy is in the dumps, so he\u2019s grasping at straws.\u201d \nEarlier Wednesday, Saskatchewan Infrastructure Minister David Marit announced that vehicles with Alberta licence plates will no longer be allowed on future government highway and building project sites. Existing projects will not be affected. \nThe ban includes contractors, sub-contractors, consultants and workers. Ministry staff will enforce the provision through job-site monitoring. \nMarit said the ban is in response to reports from Saskatchewan workers who say they face similar restrictions in Alberta. \n\u201cSaskatchewan operators feel forced to register their vehicles in Alberta if they want to do business there,\u201d said Marit. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement just levels the playing field.\u201d \nBilous said there are no such restrictions in Alberta on out-of province workers or licence plates. \nAlberta officials said there were no prior discussions or advance warning of the change from Saskatchewan. \nThe Saskatchewan Heavy Construction Association lauded the move. \n\u201cSaskatchewan heavy construction contractors have been one of the largest employers in the province in good years and in bad,\u201d association president Shantel Lipp said in a release. \n\u201cAs local construction companies obtain a larger share of the Saskatchewan construction marketplace, they develop the people, equipment and capacity to maximize their economies of scale.\u201d \nThe Alberta Roadbuilders & Heavy Construction Association said it hoped the issue can be worked out before the next construction season begins. \n\u201cIt\u2019s our understanding that there are already rules in place to require vehicles that are being used on a site to be re-registered after 30 days,\u201d the group said in a news release. \n\u201cWe are not aware of any complaints. The new Saskatchewan policy could be problematic for industry because it would force vehicles to be re-registered and require insurance changes for even short site visits or work.\u201d \nThe plate feud is the latest cross-boundary sniping between Wall\u2019s right-of-centre government and Premier Rachel Notley\u2019s left-leaning NDP. \nWall\u2019s government has previously complained about new rules to assist Alberta\u2019s craft brewers that Saskatchewan calls unfair to out-of-province beer producers.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brad wall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bilous", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david marit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel notley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deron bilous", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shantel lipp", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "saskatchewan heavy construction association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saskatchewan infrastructure", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberta roadbuilders & heavy construction association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ndp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberta economic development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saskatchewan premier", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "alberta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saskatchewan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edmonton", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:26.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "705beb697daae268fef6b3b73b021c6f54733045", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XvOP.xSLZ1wAqY9j1Yfxmk5dmGeuCdNF3CF8eCjyldBqurukBVxCcoQ2QkdgBajWxX.CqtULgr1qPlTrY7I9NIb3joF6lKdkH4lHjQeoke7iwlKl4M4NCQv22n26imP4BXY4x3F0p.59iAr5rF57L", "site_full": "www.canadianinquirer.net", "site": "canadianinquirer.net", "site_section": "http://www.canadianinquirer.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "immigration"], "section_title": "Philippine Canadian Inquirer", "title": "RCMP arrest pharmacist for trafficking after 33,000 narcotics tablets stolen", "title_full": "RCMP arrest pharmacist for trafficking after 33,000 narcotics tablets stolen", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.canadianinquirer.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/okotoks-2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "705beb697daae268fef6b3b73b021c6f54733045", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XvOP.xSLZ1wAqY9j1Yfxmk5dmGeuCdNF3CF8eCjyldBqurukBVxCcoQ2QkdgBajWxX.CqtULgr1qPlTrY7I9NIb3joF6lKdkH4lHjQeoke7iwlKl4M4NCQv22n26imP4BXY4x3F0p.59iAr5rF57L", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bea Kirstein Manalaysay", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "RCMP arrest pharmacist for trafficking after 33,000 narcotics tablets stolen", "text": "By The Canadian Press on December 7, 2017 Rogalsky has been released from custody and is to appear in Okotoks provincial court on Dec. 22.

(Pixabay photo) \nMANILA \u2014 Quantity of goods traded in the domestic market in July to September period has increased by double digit this year compared to the same period in 2016. \nPhilippine Statistics Authority (PSA) data released Thursday showed that volume of domestic trade in third quarter of the year grew 18.9 percent to 4.86 million tons from 4.09 million tons in Q3 last year. \nFood and live animals were the most traded commodities in Q3 2017 sharing 1.16 million tons or 23.9 percent of the total domestic trade in the previous quarter. \nOn the other hand, total value of flow of goods in Q3 2017 also went up by 3.3 percent to PHP154 billion from PHP149.1 billion in Q3 2016. \nAbout 99.85 percent of the total value of trade was transported across the country via water, and the remaining 0.15 percent was through air. \nMachinery and transport equipment accounted for the highest value of commodities traded within the country in Q3 2017 at 34.4 percent amounting to PHP53.1 billion. \nFlow of machinery and transport equipment goods in the country for Q3 2017 was higher by 12 percent compared to its PHP47.3 billion trade value in the same period last year. \nFood and live animals posted second largest value in domestic trade at PHP36.6 billion, followed by manufactured goods classified chiefly by material amounting to PHP18.7 billion. \nIn terms of value, other top commodities traded locally were mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials at PHP12.7 billion; chemical and related products at PHP9.5 billion; beverages and tobacco at PHP6.4 billion; miscellaneous manufactured articles at PHP5.86 billion; commodities and transactions at PHP5.4 billion; crude materials, inedible except fuels at PHP4.3 billion; and animal and vegetable oils, fats, and waxes at PHP1.4 billion. \nMoreover, Central Visayas accounted for the bulk of domestic trade inflows and outflows in Q3 2017 at 19.4 percent or a total of 940,000 tons. \nThis was followed by Central Luzon at 860,000 tons and Northern Mindanao at 790,000 million tons. Largest trade outflow in the country in the previous quarter was from the National Capital Region (NCR) reaching to PHP31.5 billion, followed by Western Visayas and Eastern Visayas at PHP27.1 billion and PHP24.6 billion, respectively. \nIn terms of balance of trade, six regions posted favorable trade balance, which include Eastern Visayas, NCR, Central Luzon, Davao Region, SOCCSKSARGEN, and Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. \nThis means these regions had more trade outflows than inflows in Q3 this year. \nMeanwhile, unfavorable trade balance was recorded in regions of Caraga, Calabarzon, Zamboanga Peninsula, Central Visayas, Mimaropa, Northern Mindanao, Ilocos Region, Western Visayas, Cagayan Valley, and Bicol.

The Palestinians want east Jerusalem \u2014 which Israel captured in 1967 \u2014 for their capital. \nBut Trump declared it was time for a new approach to Mideast peace after decades of failure. Calling Jerusalem Israel\u2019s capital, he argued, was merely recognizing the obvious. \n\u201cWe cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past,\u201d the president said. \nFreeland had been briefed on the announcement in a call Monday with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, sources told The Canadian Press. The two are together this week at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where Tillerson has been getting an earful from world leaders over Trump\u2019s move. \n\u201cWe are strongly committed to the goal of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East, including the creation of a Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and security with Israel,\u201d Freeland said in a statement. \n\u201cWe call for calm and continue to support the building of conditions necessary for the parties to find a solution.\u201d \nPrime Minister Justin Trudueau, who is on a state visit to China, told reporters Thursday that Canada will keep its embassy in Tel Aviv. \n\u201cCanada has a long-standing policy on the Mideast that we need to work toward a two-state solution through direct negotiations,\u201d Trudeau said. \n\u201cWe will continue to engage constructively and substantively in the region with partners and friends around the world.\u201d \nWorld leaders from the Pope to the Chinese government raised concerns Wednesday that Trump\u2019s move would further escalate tensions in the region and threaten the ongoing peace process, as well as any potential for the U.S. to broker any kind of peace. \nIn Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his nation was \u201cprofoundly grateful\u201d and Trump\u2019s announcement was an \u201cimportant step toward peace.\u201d \nHowever, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that the U.S. shift \u201cis a declaration of withdrawal from the role it has played in the peace process.\u201d \nNew Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh said the U.S. decision was counterproductive and Canada should speak up. \n\u201cIt is something that needs to be pointed out as being divisive,\u201d Singh said. \nThe Conservatives offered no comment, perhaps remembering their own political history. \nMuch like Trump\u2019s decision was part of a campaign promise, in 1979, Progressive Conservative leader Joe Clark made a similar promise ahead of the federal campaign. \nHe reiterated it upon winning power, but after a significant outcry from business and community leaders, backed away from the idea. \nEven former prime minister Stephen Harper, a staunch supporter of Israel, never proposed the idea, though his former foreign affairs minister courted some controversy when he met with an Israeli politician in east Jerusalem, which many diplomats refuse to do. \nBut that the proposal continues to have some political traction domestically was evident during the campaign to replace Harper, when contender Kellie Leitch proposed moving the embassy as part of her platform. \nShe wouldn\u2019t comment Wednesday. \nGroups who advocate on behalf of the Jewish community do feel the Liberals should follow Trump. \n\u201cSince the re-establishment of the modern State of Israel, Jerusalem has been the home to Israel\u2019s democratically elected parliament, independent supreme court, and national government offices,\u201d the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs said in a statement. \n\u201cWe have always maintained that Canada should formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chrystia freeland/facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name":

Here are some facts about asthma you should know: Asthma is a condition where a person finds it difficult to breathe because the tubes that take air into the lungs swell up . This reaction is caused because the airway comes in contact with an asthma trigger (an allergen) that causes it to swell up. Common symptoms of asthma are coughing which gets worse at night, wheezing (a whistling sound from the chest when the person breathes), chest tightness and shortness of breath. Read more about causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of asthma. There are two types of asthma depending on the type of trigger \u2013 extrinsic and intrinsic asthma. Extrinsic asthma is an immune response to an external allergen such as pollen, animal dander, dust, etc. Intrinsic asthma is caused due to inhaling certain chemical agents such as cigarette smoke, paint vapours, etc. In some cases it may also be worsened by a chest infection, stress, laughter etc. The most common allergens that cause asthma are pollen, dust, pollution like smoke from vehicles, animal dander, certain smells like that of diesel and petrol combustion, peeling paint and fungus or mould in enclosed areas. There are mainly two types of reactions a delayed hypersensitive response (where the person experiences symptoms after a long period of time) and an instant hypersensitive response (where the person immediately develops symptoms to the allergen). Some drugs like aspirin and other NSAIDs are also known to cause asthma attacks. A person can develop asthma at any age, and some researchers believe that it may even be a genetically inherited trait. Young children can suffer from mild asthma, which usually progresses to a more severe form later in life. Doctors have found that women going through emotional stress or menopause , experience peaks of estrogen levels in their body which leads to the swelling of the airways leading to sudden and severe asthma attacks. This phenomenon can occur in women who have never had asthma all their lives. There are a number of ways to treat the symptoms of asthma \u2014 allopathic and natural remedies . In the allopathic method the most effective way to treat asthma is to use inhaled medication. There are two types of medicines available \u2014 relievers and preventers . Relievers are used in cases of emergency, and are quick acting agents. They are inhaled and help the surrounding muscle relax, allowing the person to breath normally again. Preventers are steroid-based medicines that help asthmatics by reducing the sensitivity of their airways to allergens. Preventers are inhaled directly into the lungs, thereby allowing very little of the steroid into the body itself. Apart from the traditional inhalers, there are steroid-based tablets that one can take to control asthma. These tablets usually take longer to react in case of an emergency since they are ingested and not inhaled. Having steroid-based tablets to control asthma gives the patient a 50 times greater dose of corticosteroids. Long term use of tablets has serious side effects such as osteoporosis, diabetes, bruising easily, cataract, heart burn and acidity. It is a common myth that a person cannot die because of asthma that is not true. According to the WHO \u2013 of the 300 million people who suffer from asthma, 25,000 of them died due to the disorder in 2005. Asthma can be prevented. First identify the causative agent of the asthma. The next step is to follow a desensitization pattern. This means helping the body slowly reduce its sensitivity to the particular allergen with controlled exposure to it. Another way to prevent the disease is to make a few lifestyle changes, like maintaining a healthy lifestyle with a healthy diet and some form of exercise. Lastly, it is important for a patient to follow their doctor\u2019s instructions regarding schedule regarding medication and regular checkups.

Matthew Heineman uses this new weapon to devastating effect in Cartel Land , closely tailing murderous members of the Knights Templar Cartel in Mexico while playing ride along with a vigilante group calling themselves Autodefensas. Heineman clearly possesses balls of steel, as we find ourselves witnessing first-hand explosive gun-fights in the streets and close-up vigilante beatings, all the result of society's reaction to living in fear of cartel violence. It's a scary portrait of a country seemingly locked in a cycle of corruption and brutality, and how its influence has spilled over to the borders of the U.S..\n\nThere are two stories in Cartel Land , with one understandably receiving more focus and screen-time than the other. In Michoacan, Mexico, surgeon and public speaker Jose Manuel Mireles - known as 'El Doctor' - has formed the Autodefensas, a group of citizens who have lived under the cartel's tyranny for too long. They move from town to town, successfully driving out the gang members and receiving the adoration and support of the residents in the process. The government has labelled them a dangerous vigilante organisation operating outside of the law, but in one scene they manage to drive away the military with the backing of fellow citizens as their power and influence rapidly increases. In the U.S., Tim 'Nailer' Foley heads the Arizona Border Retcon, another vigilante group with the task of stopping illegal immigration. As cartel violence spilled into their towns, their job became significantly more difficult, hampered further by the government's inability or unwillingness to help.\n\nDespite your personal views on vigilante justice, Cartel Land begins with painting both Mireles and Foley as men with good intentions. They both live in a lawless land where the government have either abandoned them or actually contributed to the growing issues. Yet their actions also have consequences. Mireles' 'Robin Hood' persona soon starts to peel away with suggestions of infidelity and a ballooning ego, and the solidarity of the Autodefensas starts to wobble as in-group power plays and cartel infiltration emerge. The goals of Foley and the Border Retcon attract the most right-wing nutcases with questionable motives, and although he is happy for the help, it has led to the group being labelled an extremist organisation. There is an imbalance to the amount of screen-time given to these parallel stories, but Cartel Land succeeds as an honest and eye-opening account of how people can rally together when their supposed protectors have abandoned them, but also how vigilante justice amidst widespread corruption can have devastating consequences.\n\nDirected by: Matthew Heineman \nStarring: Jos\u00e9 Manuel 'El Doctor' Mireles , Tim 'Nailer' Foley \nCountry: USA\n\nRating: **** \n\nTom Gillespie\n\n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "heineman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom gillespie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose manuel mireles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mireles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim 'nailer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robin hood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew heineman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jos\u00e9 manuel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "arizona border retcon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "autodefensas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cartel land", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knights templar cartel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michoacan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:27.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3c333a8bc2e02874a167767995f1005c6da7c92f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4UEkjK18.G3fXvo4aOxQtcla75Rh91sc7SDCrVDO06PA.3DqLVXCR0jduWKLAM3VQpN4s0E3Id9N3vc8MM3Z9ymAD9u.RR68-", "site_full": "amarillo.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://amarillo.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist amarillo | personals search", "title": "Wet & tight pussy - w4m (amarillo)", "title_full": "Wet & tight pussy - w4m (amarillo)", "published": "2017-12-07T09:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3c333a8bc2e02874a167767995f1005c6da7c92f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4UEkjK18.G3fXvo4aOxQtcla75Rh91sc7SDCrVDO06PA.3DqLVXCR0jduWKLAM3VQpN4s0E3Id9N3vc8MM3Z9ymAD9u.RR68-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "Wet & tight pussy - w4m (amarillo)", "text": "favorite this post Wet & tight pussy - w4m (amarillo) hide this posting unhide   Hey daddy let me relieve some of your stress do you need a body rb and some wet tight pussy from a lesbian come watch me bounces that ass on that dick... do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 6415736754", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:27.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d6f5b10ab46c0f6da7f3d5d1d068ac7cda8d8a99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4UEkjK18.G3fXvo4aOxQtcla75Rh91seHt5RWMLRqEfKGNKPfHajLtz6ASCkDaK8kOj.z3.k_XQ--", "site_full": "amarillo.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://amarillo.craigslist.org/search/ppp?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist amarillo | personals search", "title": "BBW FWB (amarillo)", "title_full": "BBW FWB (amarillo)", "published": "2017-12-07T09:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d6f5b10ab46c0f6da7f3d5d1d068ac7cda8d8a99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4UEkjK18.G3fXvo4aOxQtcla75Rh91seHt5RWMLRqEfKGNKPfHajLtz6ASCkDaK8kOj.z3.k_XQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "BBW FWB (amarillo)", "text": "age: 26   Looking for fwb type of situation.

A good manicure Cross Creek TX will leave you with gorgeous looking nails that are healthy as well. Here are some tips and tricks that you can use to get your nails looking their best.\n\nChoosing the right salon is important. You will want to make sure that the tools they use are clean. It is easy for bacteria to grow on manicuring tools. Look for an autoclave or other sterilizing equipment. Using a sterilizer on tools is the only way to keep them from spreading bacteria from one client to another.\n\nYou need to think about whether you want to keep your nails natural or if you want to have gel or acrylic ones put on. If you are athletic or if your natural nails are weak or brittle it may be difficult to prevent breakage. If you do experience breakage it will mean that your fingers do not look good no matter how much you spend on manicures. Some salons may charge fifty dollars or more depending on what you are having done so it is important to think carefully before making a final decision.\n\nThe process for all manicures is relatively similar. A technician will have you remove any old polish. They will have you soak your hands to soften the cuticles so that they can be pushed back away from the nail bed. A great nail technician will use creams or lotions to remove excess cuticles. You will want to make sure that your cuticles are not trimmed with any sharp tools. This can end up damaging them and you may end up with an infection if the tools are not clean.\n\nIf you are having acrylics or gels put on the technician will need to grind down the surface of your nail. This is so that once the overlay is applied the nail will not be excessively thick. Make sure that when the grinder is being used that the technician does not take too much of your natural nail off. If you end up damaging the nail bed you can end up developing an infection.\n\nThe length and shape of your nails will also influence how attractive they will look as well as how easy it will be to follow your normal routine once they have been applied. While you may want long, dramatic tips put on your hands it may be difficult to keep them from breaking if you are not used to having them.\n\nOnce your natural nails have been shaped and filed or your false ones applied they will be painted. Many people like to have a solid color applied whereas some will enjoy having French tips applied. This usually means a neutral base with a white or light colored tip. Choosing an understated look will help keep your look beautiful and professional no matter what time of year it is.\n\nOf course you need to make sure that you do your part to keep things looking good. Problems tend to pop up when women soak their hands in water for extended periods of time. Prying things open can also stress your nails and cause them to break or tear.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are searching for information about a manicure Cross Creek TX residents can come to our web pages online today.

The exhibit, which is free and open to the public, will run until Dec. 8 in the Lobby Gallery on both the first and second floor. \nThe exhibit is described as a \u201cmultimedia exhibit of healing artists\u2026 representing the use of art in health: healing, inspiring, transforming and overcoming illnesses. Whether the art is literal or not, any artwork in any form that takes the artist or the viewer from a place of pain or illness (physical or emotional) \u2013 can be an instrumental healing modality.\u201d \nMany different pieces of art are on display. Accompanying the unique pieces are descriptions of the creations, where the artists have the opportunity to express themselves with words in addition to their art. Some spoke of their art being inspired by a personal tragedy, and how art has helped them on their journeys to heal. Some pieces are listed as for sale. \nThe art on display was a combination of many different types of artists and healing artists: art students, fine artists, art therapists, and rehabilitative artists and clients. The themes within the art included poverty, autism, peace, transformation, freedom, happiness, breast cancer awareness, escapism and nature. \nDifferent mediums of art are being showcased, including paintings, booklets, drawings and mixed media. All pieces are unique, deeply personal and beautiful. \nInformation at the exhibit explained that Art & Health is \u201ca diverse, multidisciplinary field dedicated to transforming health and healing by connecting people with the arts at key moments in their lives.
