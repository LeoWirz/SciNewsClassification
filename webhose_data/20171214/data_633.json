It included this sentence: \u201cWhat we failed to predict was the successful, collective manipulation of nearly all \u201cmarkets\u201d by the CBs, their primary dealers and their willing/sycophant media through HFT.\u201d \nThat one sentence could be the subject of a full post or podcast but, for now, let\u2019s just focus upon the market manipulation through HFT. As you know by now, the USDJPY is just about the single most important general input for HFT buy/sell decisions. Whether it\u2019s S&P futures, bond futures or Comex Gold, the direction of the USDJPY generally impacts all of these \u201cmarkets\u201d more than anything else. The chart below plots the inverse of USDJPY (JPYUSD) with gold futures. Note clear correlation that began in 2008. \nIn observing the central bank market manipulation\u2026when we see the same pattern again and again\u2026and this pattern is followed by the desired equity or bond market reaction\u2026then you know something is up. How many times have we captured screenshots of the BoJ, Fed, SNB or whomever buying the USDJPY in size at just the right moment to create and paint a double bottom on the chart? From there, how many times have we watched a near perfect and uninterrupted, 45-degree angle recovery ensue? \nHere are just a couple of egregious examples that I just chose at random from my desktop folder that holds about 40 charts. (I\u2019ve only been keeping them since late summer.) \nWell, since we just used the term \u201cegregious\u201d, let\u2019s apply it again to the charts below. Recall that things were sailing along surprisingly well last Monday. Over the previous week, the USDJPY had failed to hold support near 113 and again near 112 and it had fallen to near and just below the very-important 111 level. Then, as we chronicled that day, a sudden spike occurred on NO NEWS and not even any rumors. Just a spike from out of the blue that drove the pair immediately back above 111. \nAnd what followed over the next five days? Well, outside of the sudden plunge on the now disproven stories from Brian Ross at ABC News, the USDJPY has followed the same glide path all the way back to 113. Also, IT\u2019S VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE where USDJPY reopened Sunday afternoon\u2026RIGHT ON the glidepath. Remove the reaction to Friday\u2019s unexpected headlines and it\u2019s a near-perfect, 45-degree angle for nearly FIVE FULL DAYS. \n(And in case you\u2019re wondering which tail wags which dog, note the turn in USDJPY last Monday clearly preceded the turn in the S&P.) \nHow is this even possible? It\u2019s not\u2026well, at least not in the traditional and \u201cfree market\u201d sense\u2026the pre-2008 and pre-2012 sense. All of these things used to move somewhat independently as human, carbon-based traders made rational investment decisions based upon a number of inputs. However, in 2017, where 90% of all trading is now done through HFT\u2026.well, the results are pretty clear. The Central Banks and their Primary Dealer trading desks manipulate the key inputs and HFT does the rest. This is why yours truly and so many other \u201cexperts and mavens\u201d have been confounded for the past five years. It\u2019s not nefarious intent and it\u2019s not because gold bugs are cruel, heartless charlatans who are intent upon stealing as many dollars as possible from the easily-duped. Instead, it is a failure to anticipate the levels to which The Central Banks would successfully go to keep their system alive. \nUnderstanding this is why you consistently hear me cite the refrain of PHYSICAL DEMAND. It is only through a renewed crisis of confidence that this system can be broken\u2026at least as it pertains to the precious metals. Physical demand will bust The Bullion Banks by breaking their just-in-time and unallocated delivery system. Physical demand will force price to be discovered through the exchange of physical metal, not the alchemized digital garbage that permeates the system today. \nWe\u2019ll leave you today with stories from each end of The Bank monster. The first, and one that we\u2019ve been following closely since last March, is the continued run-up to renewed war on The Korean Peninsula. WHILE NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND IS CHEERING THIS ON, it is important to be prepared for all of the unknown unknowns that would come with such a catastrophe, one of them being financial calamity that could again shatter confidence in the current system. \nhttp://theweek.com/articles/740264/why-north-korea\u2026 \nAnd the other story deals with gold alchemy and the continued shunting of physical demand into sham/scam paper investments. It seems the World Gold Council is hungry to increase their fees. They are apparently planning to offer a whole new \u201cgold\u201d ETF, perhaps designed to compete with the IAU. Ask yourself, from where will this fund get the 200-300 metric tonnes of gold needed to fund its \u201cinventory\u201d? Once again, The Banks will simply perform the alchemy of leveraging current unallocated stockpiles into more and more digital \u201cgold\u201d. \nhttp://www.etf.com/sections/daily-etf-watch/new-ph\u2026 \nAgain, true physical demand is the only antidote to the poison created by the Central Bankers and the Bullion Banks. Sadly, 2018 promises another surge in war, debt, negative interest rates and de-dollarization. Will these events finally prompt enough physical demand to break The Banks?

Over 60% of battery production in 2020 was expected in China, compared with around 20% in the US, Miller said.\n\"The lithium-ion industry is a China story,\" Miller said, with Europe far behind.\nUnlike CRU, Miller did not foresee supply outpacing demand in coming years and although he expected new spodumene supply to fill any deficit in the short term, prices should remain high on tightness.\nThe story for cobalt was similar, he said. Also a component in cathodes for lithium-ion batteries, prices have surged over 60% in the past 12 months on expectations of increased demand and supply tightness.\nBut whereas lithium supply has increased markedly in anticipation of greater demand, cobalt supply remained restricted.\nAlthough traded on the London Metal Exchange, it is hard to access supply. Production is largely a byproduct of other metals such as nickel, so it is hard to get financing for projects based on cobalt prices, despite the recent spike.\nThe metal also comes nearly exclusively from the Democratic Republic of Congo, which brings with it significant supply risk, given issues around mining practice, including child labor.\nCRU expected a deficit in both mined and refined cobalt supply this year and next and although stocks should be able to meet much of the increase in demand in the short term, new supply will be needed by 2020.\nArtisanal supply was expected to play an important role, especially as a swing producer when supply is tight.\nCRU has identified a number of processors located in the DRC around Kolowezi, Likasi and Lubumbashi, that sell concentrates believed to be derived from local small scale and artisanal operations, Gordon said.\nGordon estimated these produced around 10,500 mt of artisanal cobalt in 2015 and around 8,500 mt in 2016. She forecast around 10,000 mt this year.\nAt the same time, recycling remained a concern for both lithium and cobalt, accounting for a tiny proportion of refined supply currently.\nWith a 7-8 year life, electric vehicle battery recycling volumes should start to pick up after 2021 and producers such as Apple and Nissan have talked recently about the importance of battery recycling.\nBoth speakers agreed that more work was needed in terms of regulation or industry best practice in battery recycling to secure supply.\n--George King Cassell, george.king.cassell@spglobal.com\nsupplied by johnCM\nFI$HING FOR THE NEXT TROPHY\n$UPERMAN OPINIONS MAY CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:14.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a6397ac8049da7073f991ecec9235404718fea5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvTrwrgDwWsQzCd.mpLdikttKS_m6yf.CxfwDAxqaufwW7ldhj1.HpBwr2pbr_qX9zLAxFF21vpoVLa.uFb.UGh", "site_full": "medcancersfakianakis.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://medcancersfakianakis.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Cancer by Sfakianakis Alexandros", "title": "Editorial Board", "title_full": "Editorial Board", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a6397ac8049da7073f991ecec9235404718fea5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvTrwrgDwWsQzCd.mpLdikttKS_m6yf.CxfwDAxqaufwW7ldhj1.HpBwr2pbr_qX9zLAxFF21vpoVLa.uFb.UGh", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alexandros Sfakianakis (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Editorial Board", "text": "\nPublication date: December 2017\nSource: European Journal of Surgical Oncology, Volume 43, Issue 12\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2nC9Tci", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "european journal of surgical oncology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:14.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "59491555efbd331af0e4aeee649590e822558e49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9F_yf.l4Qe0vclufdhfYzbxjF.wB.6MahMSdvVJFlv9Ys1tEEhOEdixnhZ2zCaUkL1mjPQBjxHRUDw6IsDjA.w", "site_full": "www.fightercontrol.co.uk", "site": "fightercontrol.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.fightercontrol.co.uk/forum/viewforum.php?f=350", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Aviation Videography \u2022 FighterControl \u2022 Home to the Military Aviation Enthusiast ", "title": "Nellis AFB spotting", "title_full": "Nellis AFB spotting \u2022 FighterControl \u2022 Home to the Military Aviation Enthusiast", "published": "2017-12-07T10:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.023, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "59491555efbd331af0e4aeee649590e822558e49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9F_yf.l4Qe0vclufdhfYzbxjF.wB.6MahMSdvVJFlv9Ys1tEEhOEdixnhZ2zCaUkL1mjPQBjxHRUDw6IsDjA.w", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Archer01", "published": "2017-12-07T10:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "Nellis AFB spotting", "text": "https://youtu.be/H5_OcxuCn5U See more aviation videos on my channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkFi6- ...

we reported earlier , Bitcoin brushed off the weekend sell-off and blasted above the $14,000 level as the Asian trading session got underway. There was no news to catalyse the move higher, although excitement and debate over the upcoming launch of Bitcoin futures on 10 December continues. One Bitcoin-related story did peak our interest, however. \nIt might be a sign that Bitcoin is becoming mainstream when blackmailers are prepared to accept the cryptocurrency as payment. \nGerman tabloid, Bild, is reporting that this has befallen logistics company, Deutsche Post DHL. However, the recipients of two deliveries containing explosive devices had a lucky escape, as Bloomberg explains. \nA criminal blackmailing Deutsche Post\u2019s DHL parcel service demands EU10m in the digital currency Bitcoin, German newspaper Bild reports, not saying where it got the information. Blackmailer placed two bombs in parcels delivered by DHL; bombs didn\u2019t detonate because of technical problems \nParcels included QR codes with links to extortion letter to DHL \nThreatened to send further bombs \nGerman Parcel Bomb Is Part of Extortion Plan Against DHL: Police \nHandelsblatt provided more details of one of the bombs found in the eastern German city of Potsdam. \nAuthorities confirmed Sunday the apparent bomb found near the Potsdam Christmas market on Friday was unrelated to terrorism but an attempt to blackmail delivery company DHL. The package resulted in a large-scale evacuation of the market in Potsdam, near Berlin. \n\u201cThe good news is that we can say, with all likelihood, the package was not aimed at the Christmas market,\u201d Karl-Heinz Schr\u00f6ter, Brandenburg\u2019s state interior minister, told reporters. \u201cThe bad news is that it was a blackmail attempt targeting DHL.\u201d \nThe Potsdam package, containing nails, an unidentified powder substance and a metal cylinder, was sent to a nearby pharmacy as a special delivery. The store\u2019s owner informed authorities after noticing unusual wires and hearing a hissing noise while opening the package. Police initially believed the package to be a fake bomb but, after forensic teams examined it, determined it was \u201ccapable of activation.\u201d \nThe other bomb was found in a similar package in another eastern city, Frankfurt/Oder,last month. German officials warned that the blackmailers would \u201clikely\u201d send more explosive devices in the run-up to Christmas. \nOf course, Bitcoin naysayers are likely to pounce on stories like this to dismiss Bitcoin as merely a mechanism for facilitating criminal activity . Indeed, Larry Finck of Blackrock dismissed it as a index to gauge worldwide money laundering, our old friend Neil Dwane, of Allianz Global Investors, described it as a \u201cscam for money laundering around the world\u201d and Jamie Dimon famously described it as a \u201cfraud\u201d. \nIn the meantime, the merits of Bitcoin as a means of payment and as investment continues. Yesterday, the CEO of ICE, which owns the NYSE, lamented that his organisation was \u201cbeaten to the punch\u201d in trading Bitcoin futures by the CME and CBOE. As we noted, Jeff Sprecher told a Goldman investor conference on Tuesday that that \u201cwe may be stupid for not being first on that\u201d adding that \u201cI don\u2019t have the answers, I wish I knew\u201d how the investments will evolve, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of cryptocurrencies.\u201d Comment on this Article Via Your Facebook Account Comment on this Article Via Your Disqus Account Follow Us on Facebook!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "neil dwane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry finck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karl-heinz schr\u00f6ter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff sprecher", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bild", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allianz global investors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandenburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche post dhl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blackrock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "potsdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:14.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "de573370eb544aa890ffa485d9ef2b22d5aea06c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyp8VQkLW0UKtYCOypRuudVBbaV3JJOXalWebjQLav6R0ForCFQZraRbB9ZVW1HiapIDfxpqzde9nQAH13QizBOPdEwN4GMVkbyDIRqd5wZFA--", "site_full": "fahionmagazine.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://fahionmagazine.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Fashion Mag", "title": "Lily McMenamy for Dazed Autumn 2014", "title_full": "Lily McMenamy for Dazed Autumn 2014", "published": "2017-12-05T20:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "de573370eb544aa890ffa485d9ef2b22d5aea06c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyp8VQkLW0UKtYCOypRuudVBbaV3JJOXalWebjQLav6R0ForCFQZraRbB9ZVW1HiapIDfxpqzde9nQAH13QizBOPdEwN4GMVkbyDIRqd5wZFA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Arun R (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-05T20:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "Lily McMenamy for Dazed Autumn 2014", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lily mcmenamy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:14.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6518ab9797f546dcede8b098a75a56d0d42e5fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuYQ9wS2Ww9NiK202hRion.9VymEcsonGjUa7FjuTJej79iRK54vR5_hwfmFMyLyRyXG1Pz.JR6Og--", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html?page=7&sort=newest&pagesize=15&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'html' Questions - Page 7 - Stack Overflow", "title": "html - jinja for loop inside jinja for loop", "title_full": "html - jinja for loop inside jinja for loop - Stack Overflow", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a6518ab9797f546dcede8b098a75a56d0d42e5fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuYQ9wS2Ww9NiK202hRion.9VymEcsonGjUa7FjuTJej79iRK54vR5_hwfmFMyLyRyXG1Pz.JR6Og--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "asked 5 hours ago", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "html - jinja for loop inside jinja for loop", "text": "I think the problem is the nested brackets '{{stock.{{i}}}}'.\nJust use the i variable directly: {{stock.i}} or {{stock[i]}}.\nYour describe is not explicit, I can't test it.

recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Working Party (AGIHO) of the German Society for Haematology and Medical Oncology (DGHO)", "text": "Abstract Immunocompromised patients are at high risk of invasive fungal infections (IFI), in particular those with haematological malignancies undergoing remission-induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and recipients of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT). Despite the development of new treatment options in the past decades, IFI remains a concern due to substantial morbidity and mortality in these patient populations. In addition, the increasing use of new immune modulating drugs in cancer therapy has opened an entirely new spectrum of at risk periods. Since the last edition of antifungal prophylaxis recommendations of the German Society for Haematology and Medical Oncology in 2014, seven clinical trials regarding antifungal prophylaxis in patients with haematological malignancies have been published, comprising 1227 patients. This update assesses the impact of this additional evidence and effective revisions. Our key recommendations are the following: prophylaxis should be performed with posaconazole delayed release tablets during remission induction chemotherapy for AML and MDS (AI). Posaconazole iv can be used when the oral route is contraindicated or not feasible. Intravenous liposomal amphotericin B did not significantly decrease IFI rates in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients during induction chemotherapy, and there is poor evidence to recommend it for prophylaxis in these patients (CI). Despite substantial risk of IFI, we cannot provide a stronger recommendation for these patients. There is poor evidence regarding voriconazole prophylaxis in patients with neutropenia (CII). Therapeutic drug monitoring TDM should be performed within 2 to 5 days of initiating voriconazole prophylaxis and should be repeated in case of suspicious adverse events or of dose changes of interacting drugs (BIItu). General TDM during posaconazole prophylaxis is not recommended (CIItu), but may be helpful in cases of clinical failure such as breakthrough IFI for verification of compliance or absorption.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2iybn1S\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "medical oncology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "infectious diseases working party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aml", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "german society for haematology and medical oncology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hsct", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ifi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:15.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a9142b095a230b4c2cf4f97f3d3c625ee1c03f91", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UfypjZxRov_9bMYXGzwhFAIefAiQ5n_q62sSqaeeAWN27Rw9AwGVbC1ESnO8zvv8f10tZYtNE.IzJfPU_TsNV7_aaJXkeRnEtBLVrQmmmoMsRpDy7p2AfHB", "site_full": "dealsbestjopchunm.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://dealsbestjopchunm.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "DealsBestJopchunm", "title": "Best Deal for Christmas!

He is charged with leading a terror organization, engaging in terror propaganda and other crimes. (AP Photo/Lefteris Pitarakis, File) By: Staff The Associated Press Published on ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 A trial against the imprisoned leader of Turkey's pro-Kurdish opposition party on terror charges has opened in the Turkish capital. Prosecutors are seeking a total of 142 years in prison for Selahattin Demirtas, the co-chairman of the Peoples' Democracy Party \u2014 or HDP. He is charged with leading a terror organization, engaging in terror propaganda and other crimes. The trial is one of many against Demirtas, who is imprisoned in northwestern Turkey. He did not attend Thursday's trial. Demirtas was arrested last year when the government launched a crackdown following a failed coup attempt, which critics say has been expanded to target all government opponents and dissenting voices. The government accuses the HDP, the nations' third-largest party in parliament, of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. The HDP denies the accusation. Prosecutors accuse Demirtas of being a leader of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish rebels and hold him responsible for street violence that broke out in 2014 during protests against government policies on Syria. The violence led to more than 30 deaths. The New York-based advocacy group, Human Rights Watch, criticized the trial, calling it \"part of a wider pattern of repression against government critics.\" \"Holding the leader of a major opposition party in pre-trial detention for over a year on flimsy charges is another example of the political abuse of the criminal justice system we are repeatedly seeing in Turkey,\" said Hugh Williamson, Human Rights Watch's director for Europe and Central Asia. The Turkish parliament stripped lawmakers of legal immunity last year, paving the way for the arrest of several HDP legislators \u2014 including Demirtas and former co-chairwoman Figen Yuksekdag \u2014 on terror-related charges. The arrests follow the collapse of a fragile peace process between the state and the PKK in 2015. The group is considered a terror organization by Turkey and its Western allies. Yuksekdag lost her seat in parliament earlier this year after an appeals court confirmed her 2013 conviction for engaging in terrorist propaganda, and later stepped down as the HDP's co-leader.

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) By: Danica Kirka And Lorne Cook The Associated Press Published on LONDON \u2014 Ireland expects the U.K. to make a new Brexit proposal by Friday as officials in London struggle to resolve issues surrounding the Irish border that are stalling talks over Britain's departure from the European Union. British Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure to persuade EU leaders to declare that sufficient progress has been made on divorce issues with the EU, including the Irish border, when they meet next week in Brussels so talks can move on to trade and future relations between the two sides. Business leaders warn further delays will hurt companies as they plan for the future. Ireland's prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said late Wednesday that he hopes May will submit a new offer \"tonight or tomorrow.\" Disagreements over rules governing the border between the Republic of Ireland, which is a member of the EU, and the U.K. province of Northern Ireland derailed an earlier proposal. Existing rules allow people and goods to pass freely between the Republic and Northern Ireland with no border checks. Ireland wants to preserve the current arrangement, which has eased tensions along the border. May is struggling to balance those demands against the concerns of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to support her government in Parliament. Varadkar said Wednesday that avoiding a hard border remains his \"absolute red line.\" \"We will not loosen our position,\" he told Ireland's Parliament, the Dail. \"We will stay very firm.\" The British and Irish prime ministers discussed the Brexit impasse in a phone call Wednesday, but there was no sign of an imminent breakthrough. May's office said she and Varadkar are \"working hard to find a specific solution to the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland,\" which have triggered a crisis in Britain's divorce negotiations. In Brussels, the EU's executive Commission is talking with the British government to organize a visit by May by Sunday. \"We here in the commission are still in discussions with London and the whole EU 27, notably with Dublin. So far, no white smoke,\" said EU Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas. He rejected British media speculation that May could be given until next week to demonstrate \"sufficient progress\" on the three key issues of the Brexit divorce. \"We stand ready to receive Prime Minister May at any moment in time when they are ready,\" Schinas said, but warned: \"This will have to have to happen this week.\" \"Every day lost makes this more difficult,\" he said.

Turner on Thursday in a Memphis courtroom. Judge Lee Coffee told her he would not allow another such interruption. Turner was indicted Tuesday on a first-degree murder charge. His bail is set at $1 million. Turner told the judge that he was planning to hire an attorney and Coffee set a hearing for Tuesday. Wright's body was found in a swampy field in suburban Memphis on July 28, 2010, 10 days after the 34-year-old was reported missing. He was shot multiple times. The seven-year investigation into his death has been one of the Memphis Police Department's most high-profile unsolved cases. After Marion's statement, the judge said he understands her pain because his father was killed, but he also said that he would not allow anyone to \"engage in an outburst like that.\" Wright, who was born and raised in Memphis, played for the Memphis Grizzlies and four other NBA teams as a forward and centre over 13 seasons before retiring in 2009.

Prosecutors say Melgen, a prominent Florida eye doctor who was accused of bribing New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, should get a 30-year sentence for Medicare fraud. A three-day sentencing hearing for Melgen is scheduled to begin Tuesday, Dec. 5, 2017, in West Palm Beach on 67 counts. Prosecutors say the 63-year-old doctor stole more than $100 million from the federal government. He was convicted in April after a 2 1/2- month trial.(Lannis Water/Palm Beach Post via AP, File) By: Terry Spencer The Associated Press Published on WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Either Dr. Salomon Melgen is one of the biggest Medicare swindlers ever, stealing more than $100 million from the federal health care program, or a penny ante thief who walked off with $64,000. Those were the widely contrasting arguments made Thursday by prosecutors and Melgen's defence attorneys as they tried to persuade U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra to sentence the Dominican-born, Harvard-trained doctor to 30 years or something significantly less. Prosecutors are seeking 30 years. They say the doctor subjected elderly patients to painful tests and treatments they didn't need, for diseases they didn't have, to support a vacation home in his native Dominican Republic, lavish trips to Europe and outside business interests. The government also says he bribed New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexandra Chase told Marra that Melgen's practice was so \"permeated\" with fraud that the judge should accept the government's estimate. Chase said even if the 63-year-old Melgen stole just $65 million \u2014 about half as much \u2014 he would be eligible for a life sentence. She pointed to Melgen often seeing more than 100 patients a day, and his employees performing in seconds tests that normally take 10 minutes or more, making them useless for diagnosis but allowing the doctor to bill Medicare for them. \"The system was set up to maximize fraud,\" she said. Melgen's attorneys argued that the government only proved Melgen stole about $64,000, the amount they will concede was falsely charged for 30 patients who stood in during the trial as a representative sample of the more than 2,000 Melgen saw between 2008 and 2013, most of them numerous times. They say the selection of those patients came from a larger sample of 310 that wasn't random but cherry-picked and any extrapolation from those samples should be thrown out. They want a short sentence, perhaps even time served. Josh Sheptow portrayed his client as ahead of his time, injecting patients with then-experimental drugs that are now approved. Medicare does not pay for experimental treatments, noted Sheptow, who suggested Melgen may have falsified billing statements to get around those restrictions. That would still be fraud, Sheptow said, but he said the treatments were legitimate and therefore the government didn't lose anything with many of his patients. A jury found Melgen guilty of 67 counts last April after a two-month trial, including health care fraud, submitting false claims and falsifying records in patients' files. He is charged separately with bribing Menendez in exchange for interceding with the Medicare officials investigating his practice and other favours , including getting visas for his foreign mistresses. A federal jury in New Jersey hung on that case last month, and prosecutors there have not said whether they will retry them. Melgen's attorneys rested much of their sentencing argument on the doctor's use of the drug Lucentis between 2008 and 2013. During most of that time, Medicare approved its use only for wet age-related macular degeneration or ARMD, a retinal disease that can cause blindness. Lucentis is injected in tiny doses \u2014 0.5 millilitres , or a sixty-fourth of a teaspoon. It comes in single-use vials that contain four times that amount \u2014 a sixteenth of a teaspoon. The manufacturer's instructions say doctors should pull the vial's entire contents into the syringe and then squeeze out and dispose of the excess \u2014 about a thirtieth of a teaspoon \u2014 before administering the injection. Medicare reimburses doctors their wholesale cost of $1,900 per vial plus a 6 per cent surcharge, $114. Melgen used each vial for three or four injections, charging Medicare $2,014 each time. Prosecutors say the two or three extra injections were theft. Melgen's attorneys argue that he cost the Medicare program no extra money by avoiding what he would have spent buying more vials. Melgen also administered the drug to patients who did not have wet ARMD, although he told Medicare they did. Sheptow suggested that the patients had diabetic-related sight loss, types of which Lucentis is now authorized for. He said Melgen and other eye doctors knew Lucentis worked on those diseases and suggested Melgen gave a false diagnosis to Medicare to be reimbursed for a treatment he knew was effective, even if it wasn't yet approved. That might be fraud, he said, but Medicare lost no money because its mission of providing medical care to the elderly was met. What had been a scheduled as a three-day hearing that started Tuesday will now need a fourth, possibly later this month or in January, as the sides did not finish their presentations. Marra has said he will then need time to process the information before pronouncing sentence.

But she wasn't totally surprised when her son told her his secret. Amid tears, she said, \"I knew there was something going on with you.\" Omar Mohammed, 31, disclosed in an Associated Press story Thursday that he is the man behind the legendary and widely read Mosul Eye, the pseudonym under which he wrote the catalogue of horrors that was life under Islamic State fanatics. After Mohammed told tens of thousands of Twitter and Facebook followers that he was Mosul Eye, post after post thanked him, blessed him and welcomed him with a single word: Hero. Anonymous for more than three years, Mohammed wandered the streets of occupied Mosul by day, chatting with shopkeepers and Islamic State fighters, visiting friends who worked at the hospital, swapping scraps of information. He grew out his hair and his beard and wore the shortened trousers required by the extremists. He forced himself to witness the beheadings and deaths by stoning, so he could hear killers call out the names of the condemned and their supposed crimes. By night, he was Mosul Eye, and from his darkened room he told the world what was happening. If caught, he knew he would be killed. But over three years, his double life grew too heavy to bear. His secrets consumed him, sapping the energy he needed to work on his doctoral dissertation and to help Mosul rebuild. In face-to-face conversations with AP reporters over the course of two months, he agonized over how to end the anonymity. The day he revealed his identity to the world, Mohammed told AP: \"I feel free.\" He received scores of media requests, and on Facebook and Twitter, his fans poured out their feelings. Tahani Saleh posted on Facebook: \"When death was sweeping over us, you said: We are the life. I am very proud of you, Omar.\" Bella Oskar, a member of the \"Women of Mosul\" Facebook group, wrote, \"I used to read what you posted on Mosul and your love for it and for its people. The voice of Mosul reached the world by the son of Mosul.\" Mohammed decided to reveal his identity for his thousands of readers and followers, for all his volunteers in Mosul who have been inspired by a man they have never seen. But above all, he did it in memory of his older brother, who died in the final battle for the Iraqi city, and for his grieving mother. \"I can't be anonymous anymore. This is to say that I defeated ISIS. You can see me now, and you can know me now,\" he told AP. Mohammed first posted about the Islamic State group under his own Facebook account, in the first few days after its fighters swept into the city, but a friend warned him he risked being killed. A newly minted teacher with a reputation for secular ideas, he lost his university job when IS took over. On June 18, 2014, he became Mosul Eye. His motto: Trust no one, document everything. \"My job as a historian requires an unbiased approach which I am going to adhere to and keep my personal opinion to myself,\" he wrote on that first day. Mosul Eye became one of the outside world's main sources of news about the Islamic State fighters and their transformation of the city into a grotesque shadow of itself. Much of what he collected went on the blog. Other details he kept in his computer, for fear of blowing his cover. Someday, he promised, he would write history with them. Mohammed's information sometimes included photos of the fighters and commanders, complete with biographies surreptitiously pieced together during the course of his normal life \u2014 that of an out-of-work scholar living at home. When intelligence agencies made contact with Mosul Eye, he rebuffed them. \"I am not a spy or a journalist,\" he would say. \"I tell them this: If you want the information, it's published and it's public for free. Take it.\" His computer hard drive filled with death, filed according to date, cause of death, perpetrator, neighbourhood and ethnicity. Accompanying each spreadsheet entry was a separate file with observations from each day. \"IS is forcing abortions and tubal ligation surgeries on Yazidi women,\" he wrote in unpublished notes from January 2015. A doctor told him there had been between 50 and 60 forced abortions and a dozen Yazidi girls younger than 15 died of injuries from repeated rapes. April 19, 2015: \"The forensics department received the bodies of 23 IS militants killed in Baiji. They had no shrapnel, no bullets, no explosives and the cause of death does not seem to be explosion. It is like nothing happened to the bodies. A medical source believes they were exposed to poison gas.\" July 7, 2015: \"43 citizens were executed in different places, this time by gunfire, which is unusual because they were previously beheadings. A source inside IS said that 13 of those who were executed are fighters and they tried to flee.\" Finally, he decided it was time to get out. On Dec. 15, 2015, he left with a smuggler whom he paid $1,000. Overnight, Mohammed had transferred the contents of his computer to a hard-drive that he packed with him. Once in Europe, Mosul Eye kept at his mission: via WhatsApp and Viber, from Facebook messages and long conversations with friends and relatives who had contacts within IS. By mid-2016, deaths were piling up faster than he could record. The Islamic State group was on a hunt for traitors and the airstrikes were taking an increasing toll on everyone. His records grew haphazard, and he turned to Twitter to document the atrocities. In February 2017, he received asylum in Europe. After he posted his name on Facebook, among the dozens of responses one from Safwan al-Madani stood out: \"You defied all expectation and speculation about who you are. We waited for so long for this moment.\" Editors' Picks ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maggie michael", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lori hinnant", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "viber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul eye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omar mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mosul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tigris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:18.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "85ee49ef17a2c0bb2d0a3d8a631a30dc99bc7027", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iukx.1bvM7k3sm_pKFn98RozwXUxnNgOidMGd916cRxiDTzSEjjZjqzhjeSWrqGUSSWCROrMVkLTTaEc9gQDsBhnJOpg3i0vWFpWIK1dPcqJ_Chx2m1OcFmTxJKGBcS2qZzrm6Me4NQ--", "site_full": "www.metronews.ca", "site": "metronews.ca", "site_section": "http://www.metronews.ca/feeds.articles.news.rss", "site_categories": ["canada", "travel"], "section_title": "METRO NEWS | NEWS", "title": "Emotional testimony expected as ex-officer's sentencing ends", "title_full": "Emotional testimony expected as ex-officer's sentencing ends", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.metronews.ca/content/dam/thestar/2017/12/07/emotional-testimony-expected-as-ex-officer-s-sentencing-ends/CAET809-126-2016-061236.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 37932, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85ee49ef17a2c0bb2d0a3d8a631a30dc99bc7027", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iukx.1bvM7k3sm_pKFn98RozwXUxnNgOidMGd916cRxiDTzSEjjZjqzhjeSWrqGUSSWCROrMVkLTTaEc9gQDsBhnJOpg3i0vWFpWIK1dPcqJ_Chx2m1OcFmTxJKGBcS2qZzrm6Me4NQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Meg Kinnard - The Associated Press", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Emotional testimony expected as ex-officer's sentencing ends", "text": "White ex-cop gets 20 years for Walter Scott slaying Share on Facebook Share via Email Print FILE - In this Monday, Dec. 5, 2016, file photo, Judy Scott, center, Walter Scott's mother, is comforted by her son Rodney Scott, as the family attorneys, Chris Stewart, left, and Justin Bamberg, right, hold a press conference after a mistrial was declared in former South Carolina officer, Michael Slager's trial in Charleston, S.C. Slager, who fatally shot a black motorist, Walter Scott, in 2015, could learn his fate as soon as his federal sentencing hearing winds down. On Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017, attorneys are expected to call friends and relatives of both men who'll tell the judge how Scott's death and the officer's arrest have impacted their lives. (AP Photo/Mic Smith, File) By: Meg Kinnard The Associated Press Published on CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 One by one, relatives of the late Walter Scott urged a judge to mete out a significant punishment for Michael Slager, the white former police officer who fatally shot Scott, an unarmed black man, in the back after a 2015 traffic stop. Through tears, Scott's family told Slager they felt sorrow for him and the loss his young children would feel in his absence. In the end, a judge sentenced Slager to 20 years in prison, giving the Scott family the justice they had sought ever since a stranger came to them with the shocking video of Scott being killed. \"I forgive Michael Slager. I forgive you,\" Scott's mother, Judy, said as she turned toward her son's killer. \"I pray for you, that you would repent and let Jesus come in your life.\" Sitting just a few feet away, Slager wiped tears from his eyes and mouthed: \"I'm sorry.\" The punishment wrapped up a case that became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Slager, 36, is one of only a few police officers to go to prison for a fatal shooting, and his sentence is by far the stiffest since the shootings came under extra scrutiny in recent years. Attorneys for the former North Charleston officer said he shot the 50-year-old Scott in self- defence after the two fought and Scott grabbed Slager's stun gun. They said race didn't play a role in the shooting and Slager never had any \"racial animus\" toward minorities. Still, Slager pleaded guilty in federal court to violating Scott's civil rights. As part of a plea agreement reached in May, prosecutors dropped state murder charges. \"This is a tragedy that shouldn't have happened,\" U.S. District Judge David Norton said. Slager apologized to the Scott family, calling Scott's mother and brothers by their names. \"With my actions that day, Walter Scott is no longer with his family, and I am responsible for that,\" Slager said. Of their forgiveness, he added: \"I am very grateful for that.\" Slager's emotions stood in stark contrast to his stoic demeanour during his state murder trial when jurors deadlocked over a verdict. He has several weeks to appeal his sentence and will be housed at the Charleston County jail until he's assigned to a federal prison. After the sentencing, Judy Scott and Walter's two brothers told reporters that, while they had made peace with the case, they remained adamant the officer should pay for his crime. \"Who are we not to forgive?\" Rodney Scott said. A bystander recorded the shooting on a cellphone, and it was shared around the world, setting off protests across the U.S. as demonstrators said it was another egregious example of police officers mistreating African-Americans. Slager fired at Scott's back from 17 feet (5 metres ) away. Five of eight bullets hit him. The video was seized on by many as vivid proof of what they had been arguing for years: that white officers too often use deadly force unnecessarily against black people. When the jury failed to reach a verdict in the state murder case, many black people and others were shocked and distressed, because the video seemed to some to be an open-and-shut case. Some despaired of ever seeing justice. The shooting angered local African-Americans who complained for years that North Charleston police harassed blacks, pulling them over or questioning them unnecessarily as they cracked down on crime. But after the shooting, the Scott family successfully pleaded for calm, asking everyone to let the justice system run its course. Two months after the shooting, a young white man killed nine black church members in a racially motivated massacre during a Bible study in Charleston. The family members of those victims struck a similar forgiveness tone after that attack. Before Slager's sentence was handed down, the judge had to decide whether the shooting amounted to second-degree murder or manslaughter. Norton found that it was murder. \"No matter what sentence I give, neither the Scott family nor the Slager family is going to think that it's right,\" the judge said. After the shooting, Slager picked up his stun gun and placed it next to Scott. Slager contended he was securing the weapon. Prosecutors think he put it there to bolster his self- defence story. The judge also found that Slager obstructed justice when he made statements to state police after the shooting. A pre-sentencing report for Slager found that he committed manslaughter and recommended 10 to nearly 13 years in prison. But the judge was not bound by that review. If Slager had faced another state trial and been convicted of murder, he could have been sentenced to anywhere from 30 years to life in prison. Convictions in police officer shootings are uncommon in the U.S. and prison time is even rarer. South Carolina has been aggressive in charging white officers who shoot unarmed black people. Four have pleaded guilty in state or federal court in the past six years. But only Slager and former state trooper Sean Groubert, who shot a man as he tried to get his wallet during a seat belt violation check, will have been sent to prison. Groubert was sentenced to five years behind bars. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP . Read her work at https://apnews.com/search/meg%20kinnard .

Raila Odinga alleged Thursday that dozens of Kenyans have been killed by the security forces and \"nobody is talking about it. Yet they have the audacity to come and advise us to forget and move on.\" He spoke outside a morgue in the capital Nairobi while accompanying families collecting bodies of the police's alleged victims. A U.S. Embassy statement Wednesday called Odinga's planned protest event on Dec. 12 \"extra- constitutional \" and urged him to cancel the event. Odinga successfully challenged Kenyatta's August re-election but then boycotted a rerun vote in October, demanding electoral reforms. Kenyatta was inaugurated last week.

December 7, 2017 09:34 GMT Crews work on the engine of an Air New Zealand Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. Getty Images \nAir New Zealand has been forced to ground some of its international flights after revealing some of the Rolls-Royce engines mounted had to be inspected. \nCiting \"two recent events\", the carrier said on Thursday (7 December) that a number of Trent 1000 engines that powered its Boeing 787-9 fleet needed maintenance \"sooner than previously advised\" and confirmed flights would be cancelled or delayed every day for the forthcoming weeks. \nThe news comes after two Air New Zealand flights, heading to Tokyo and Buenos Aires respectively, were forced to return to Auckland after take off earlier this week, due to unspecified engineering issues. \nAccording to the New Zealand Herald, passengers on the flight to Tokyo reported hearing \"weird noises\" and said the aircraft was shaking throughout the flight. \nWhile New Zealand's national carrier did not disclose the cause of the issue, the New Zealand Transport Accident Investigation Commission said it was investigating two events involving \"engine abnormalities\". \nAir New Zealand is not the first airline to report issues with Rolls-Royce's Trent 1000 engines. In August last year, All Nippon Airways announced it would replace all 100 Rolls-Royce engines on its fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners following three engine failures earlier in the year. \nThe issue stemmed from corrosion and cracking of turbine blades and forced Rolls-Royce to fit new blades on all the 787s operated by Japan's largest airline. News of the replacement, however, was seen as a major blow for the carrier, which is the world's largest operator of 787s, as the process can take up to three years. \nEarlier this year, Virgin Atlantic switched one of its daily trans-Atlantic flights to Delta Air Lines, which bought a 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic in 2012, to allow the Trent 1000 engines mounted on its 787 Dreamliners to undergo maintenance. \nRolls-Royce said it was working with Air New Zealand to minimise disruption and vowed to restore full flight operations as soon as possible. \n\"It's not uncommon for long-term engine programmes to experience technical issues during their life and we manage them through proactive maintenance,\" a Rolls-Royce spokeswoman was quoted as saying by Reuters.

The most fun is usually had over the full weekend.\nCost: $24.00 a night per campsite, $25.00 Fri and Sat nights (Misc costs see below)\nTime: Check-in 3PM... Checkout 1PM\nReservations can be made starting January 2018 Save up and get your reservations in RULES and REGISTRATIONS\nRegistration is by reservation. Sites 1 - 4 are local walk-in sites. Sites 5 - 41 are by reservation. We can stop in the office or call 1-866-644-6727. I am looking to get us all in one area, preferably starting with site 11 lakeside as in the past. HOWEVER... we will take what we can get so long as we all are together or as close as possible. Everything is within easy walking distance, so if you are unable to get a site right in the main area we seek, it is not a big deal... even for wheelchair use. There are paved areas that are easily accessible to every site!!! For those who like to get there early, you will be charged the night before if you arrive before 6AM, and you will be charged another day if not out by 1PM.\nBicycling is permitted in the campground but not after dark.\nThose visiting people camping may visit from 6AM to 10PM.\nTwo (2) pets permitted per campsite but must remain leashed.\nNo firearms or fireworks... this goes without saying.\nNo alcohol. Rag's interpretation... keep it quiet, responsible and in plain cups with bottles and cans hidden and there should not be an issue, but get hammered at your own risk. Our Gatherings have always been responsible before, so I see no reason why that should change now. Bring a good insulated cup/mug with straw or spout and be adults and there should be no reason to question. It IS nice to have a couple drinks just to relax with friends and family. This IS PUBLIC STATE LAND and open container and public intoxication laws of Ohio apply!!!\nFires permitted only in stoves, grills, or designated areas. Leave no fire unattended.\nNOISE must be kept to a minimum between 11PM and 7AM.\nThe park has a dumping station for waste water. USE IT. There are also drinking fountains and spigots for usable water.\nIce is available on site, though a bit steep. There are also a couple soda machines.\nNo collecting firewood or cutting down trees. I usually supply.\nA campsite may not be occupied by more than six people. Parents with multiple children excepted.\nNo trespassing on other people's sites. We seem to be the only ones that adhere to this. They can dredge for their bodies later. Camping Equipment Limited To;\n1.) One tent or tents having a separate or combined floor space not in excess of 200 sq ft or\n2.) One bus, travel trailer, house vehicle, motor home, station wagon, motorcycle, car, truck, van, pickup camper (None of these may exceed 35 feet in length) in combination with a tent or tents listed above.\n3.) One motor vehicle, in addition to one of the above mentioned vehicle, may be parked on the site parking pad in lieu of other vehicles.\nWe have plenty of room if we get our lakeside camping areas. We will find a way to squeeze people in. No worries.\nMISC DETAILS;\nA fishing license is required to fish. As woob and I are usually out fishing before July, we will post if the fishing is good or not before money is spent on an out of state license. Some years are good here... and some suck. You never know until you fish it and see.\nThere is a staffed office and workers at the campground.\nIce machines and soda machines, canoe, party barge, and paddle boat rentals.\nThere is firewood available for purchase on site, and I will be bringing wood as well. (SSs ... theirs is expensive )\nThere is a small beach at the campground, a small playground, showers and heads. There is also various gaming stuff available from the park office for use. As a family, we do welcome kids!!! We have always been family oriented, and do quite well except for the occasional slip of the lip, but we do try to avoid such.\nThere is a larger public beach not far away with facilities and parking as well, and a swing-set.\nThere is also an ice cream stand open during summer hours nearby the beach.\nMISC COSTS;\nIn addition to the site fee(s), in 2015 everyone usually did their own thing for meals and drinks. We simply ate together. Most cooking was done by Doug for the group. This seemed to work out pretty well. We will work along these lines again this Gathering, tentatively, but do plan on bringing funds for various miscellaneous expenses that arise. IE, propane, firewood, paper plates, plastics, and napkins/paper towels. We do approach this as a family, and families share. None go without, but do not take advantage. Share and share alike!!!\nIf you do not have much in the way of camping gear, do not worry about it. If you have a tent, a chair, a flashlight, and something to sleep on/in, we can usually help with the rest. We set up a main commissary and main fire area, so that covers almost all the required needs.\nThis seems like a lot for a Gathering, but it is mostly rules and regs for the campsite. My rules are much simpler. Have fun but be responsible... remember we are a family and our kids do attend... keep the drinking low key and the noise level low ... and if Raziel, woob, Sid, Doug, or myself ask you to do something if you may be getting a bit loud or something, just listen and be cool about it all. We are all there to have fun and build memories to last us all a lifetime\nMore info and such will be posted as it is gathered.\nPics in following post.\nDO NOTE... the site fees are subject to change, but I do not expect them to change. If they do, the change will be minimal.\nAny questions you may have can be fielded my myself, Raziel, or Sidona.\nDo bear in mind this is OHIO. Weather changes drastically in a very short time!!! Be prepared for rain, broiling sun and heat, or downright cold!!!\nOn a different note, with regards to showers, disability showers are also available large enough for wheelchairs, shower chairs etc, and these come with an upper and lower shower-head. One or both may be used. As I discovered the hard way, if you use these showers, turn the water on BEFORE stepping into it. One can receive a very rude awakening being hit squarely in the nether regions with cold water until the hot water clears the pipes!!! Rest assured you will immediately be wide awake. Bring a pair of shower shoes (flip-flops) for use in the showers. They are cleaned and maintained, but not after each individual use.\nWe intend to try and get lakeside lots. If using tents, remember to bring some good stakes and extra rope. If weather blows in, the wind coming over the water can become rather harsh at times.\nIf you wish to travel light, and are interested, you can ship your larger items to woob and I, and we will get it to the campground for you. This should help a great deal for those who my be traveling by air, bike, etc. Just get ahold of me so we can work out the details.\nI AM ALREADY EXCITED ABOUT SEEING MY FAMILY AGAIN", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:18.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "54ac5a84f2063fef94cf59be2056319994370134", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ScoimW67Wq19.I7vuglWiHOYwy3MVUKWdEtZxlhdczDh6jI63jw6reb72xUszPKU-", "site_full": "www.chicagosplash.com", "site": "chicagosplash.com", "site_section": "http://www.chicagosplash.com/feed", "site_categories": ["fashion", "style_and_fashion"], "section_title": "SPLASH", "title": "Web break!", "title_full": "Web break!", "published": "2017-12-06T17:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.chicagosplash.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-884587508.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54ac5a84f2063fef94cf59be2056319994370134", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ScoimW67Wq19.I7vuglWiHOYwy3MVUKWdEtZxlhdczDh6jI63jw6reb72xUszPKU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Splash Staff", "published": "2017-12-06T17:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "Web break!", "text": "By Splash Staff / General / Latest / December 6, 2017 The best news, gossip and trivia from around the Internet to help get you over the mid-week hump. \nSquad goals There\u2019s a new wave of activists coming to the forefront of history \u2014 and it\u2019s a very fashionable group. On the heels of the announcement that Conde Nast\u2019s brainchild, Teen Vogue, will no longer be regularly distributed, editor Elaine Welteroth and digital editor Phillip Picardi decided to round up their demographic and head to L.A. for the first annual Teen Vogue Summit . What actually interested me in this summit was the panel of women like Hillary Clinton and Maxine Waters who spoke to a lawn of trendy teenagers about the importance of activism and staying woke during this challenging political climate. Makeup tutorials and clothing hauls are cool, but so is getting involved and speaking up for what you believe in. \u2014 Contributing writer Beth Delany \nThe royal treatment Everyone says the shining star of \u201cThe Crown\u201d \u2014 which premieres its second season Dec. 8 \u2014 is Queen Elizabeth, played by Claire Foy. But I\u2019d argue it\u2019s Vanessa Kirby, the beautiful spitfire who plays the queen\u2019s chain-smoking younger sister and ultimate trouble maker of Buckingham Palace, Margaret. Vanity Fair writer Julie Miller interviewed Kirby, who she calls the \u201cheartbeat of the first season,\u201d about her commitment to playing the princess and staying true to her essence. Kirby even has pictures of Princess Margaret all over her house \u2014 even in \u201cthe loo\u201d\u2014 for inspiration. \u201c\u2026 I think [it\u2019s] quite disturbing for anyone who comes over and doesn\u2019t know that I play her.\u201d I\u2019ve always been fascinated by Princess Margaret. Most people know her as the sad princess because of her misfortune in love, but I think Kirby\u2019s portrayal shows viewers that Princess Margaret was just a young girl who was bent on the pursuit of a good time, but fell victim to her times \u2014 and title. \u2014Senior editor Chiara Milioulis \nA very Kardashian Christmas If there\u2019s one thing I love, it\u2019s an adorable toddler. But throw in Kim Kardashian and her two children into the mix, and I love it even more. For the holidays this year, KKW is gifting us with a 25-day countdown to Christmas with intimate photos of her family. Shot by photographer/creative director Eli Russell Linnetz (who also shot Kanye\u2019s \u201cFade\u201d music video), fans get to see North West, 4, and Saint West, 2, in their cutest, most candid form. \u2014 Editorial intern Gretchen Sterba \nKick in the pants There seems to be a little confusion among a myriad of power-hungry men that needs clarification. Matt Lauer, Harvey Weinstein and Louis C.K. (just to name a few) seem to be under the offensive and false assumption that power and success translate into being able to freely expose yourself whenever you feel like it \u2014 regardless of your present environment and who you might permanently scar. We would very much like to clear up any confusion and recommend this step-by-step guide of when it is and when it is not OK to drop-trou. Based on recent events, this explanation is crucial. Chris Rosenthall speaks on behalf of all of us when he explains that keeping your pants on at the workplace should be the general rule of thumb. \u2014 Contributing writer Beth Delany",

Some homes are filled with so many decorations there isn't much of the house structure left to see. Some yards are full of inflatable Christmas decorations which seem to be the rave the past few years.\n\nYet, in one instant these objects of delight and wonder can take you to a place that can capture your heart. Soon you can find yourself swallowed up in the glamour and spectacle of it all. And if you are not careful, these decorations can become an object of adoration.\n\nWhen something else other than the God of heaven captures your heart, there is a problem. As God fathered Jesus by way of the Holy Spirit, He gave us a gift of love that we ought to adore more than life itself.\n\nDecorating your home to celebrate the season of Christmas is a personal choice and one of the freedoms we can enjoy here in the West. But if we choose to adorn our homes inside and out with the colorful decorations of the season, and give homage and honor to those things. If we pay more attention to the objects of the season instead of the main object in the personage of Jesus Christ, we are at great risk of robbing God the glory and honor and exaltation.\n\nIf you choose to decorated your home, do so as you please. But don't let those things become an object of your adoration and worship. That belongs to God and God alone!\n\n1 Chronicles 29:11-14 \nYours, O Lord, is the greatness, The power and the glory, The victory and the majesty; For all that is in heaven and in earth is Yours; Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, And You are exalted as head over all. Both riches and honor come from You, And You reign over all. In Your hand is power and might; In Your hand it is to make great And to give strength to all. Now therefore, our God, we thank You And praise Your glorious name. \n\nIn Christ,\nPastor Tom\n\u201cAs for me and my house, we will serve the LORD\u201d \u2013 Joshua 24:15", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joshua 24:15", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus christ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "holy spirit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "west", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:18.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a07c042d2a4cc3f6b45b8edb8627898da85f5499", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqrGNRgIF_8DPwrd3_reTjCUnTN6jhLHCOXuSdNYie280c1tXEMGxGmuzNkTaSiXw3FEb6Y5r4HUJZDwlwBIk5XjHCyW.4V_7G55UnZpfiG5KscvxEYjty4rwby2JTU8Uo7jRibmgTwi4WxPCECiVf4Bjq4u9okMTb3TE6eFjKFw--", "site_full": "healthunlocked.com", "site": "healthunlocked.com", "site_section": "https://healthunlocked.com/nhsweightloss", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "HealthUnlocked | The social network for health", "title": "HealthUnlocked | The social network for health", "title_full": "HealthUnlocked | The social network for health", "published": "2017-12-07T08:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.035, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5912, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "74511460f4c817d03de78061f351d84e00561b02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqrGNRgIF_8DPwrd3_reTjCUnTN6jhLHCOXuSdNYie280c1tXEMGxGmuzNkTaSiXw3FEb6Y5r4HUJZDwlwBIk5XjHCyW.4V_7G55UnZpfiG5KscvxEYjty4rwby2JTU8Uo7jRibmgTwi4WxPCECiVf4Bjq4u9okMTaJQOuAXFeTR4n6lmi_7nn", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Minniewinny", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Best advice as Moreless had said, go see your doctor or health professional..

Copied from a reprint in the National Tribune. Vol. 4, No. 12, December 1880. \nThe last time I ever saw Anthony Sherman was on the fourth of July, 1859, in Independence square. He was then ninety-nine years old, and becoming very feeble. But though so old, his dimming eyes rekindled as he gazed upon Independence Hall, which he came to visit once more. \nLet us go into the hall, he said. I want to tell you an incident of Washington's life--one which no one alive knows of except myself; and, if you live, you will before long, see it verified. \nFrom the opening of the Revolution we experienced all phases of fortune, now good and now ill, one time victorious and another conquered. The darkest period we had, I think, was when Washington after several reverses, retreated to Valley Forge, where he resolved to pass the winter of 1777. Ah! I have often seen the tears coursing down our dear commander's careworn cheeks, as he would be conversing with a confidential officer about the conditions of his poor soldiers. You have doubtless heard the story of Washington's going to the thicket to pray. Well, it was not only true, but he used often to pray in secret for aid and comfort from God, the interposition of whose Divine Providence brought us safely through the darkest days of tribulation. \nOne day, I remember it well, the chilly winds whistled through the leafless trees, though the sky was cloudless and the sun shone brightly, he remained in his quarters nearly all afternoon alone. When he came out I noticed that his face was a shade paler than usual, and there seemed to be something on his mind of more than ordinary importance. Returning just after dusk, he dispatched as orderly to the quarters of the officer I mention who was presently in attendance. After a preliminary conversation of about half and hour, Washington, gazing upon his companion with that strange look of dignity which he alone could command, said to the latter: \n\"I do not know whether it is owing to the anxiety of my mind, or what, but this afternoon, as I was sitting at this table engaged in preparing a dispatch, something seemed to disturb me. \n\nWashington's Headquarters Office Looking up, I beheld standing opposite me a singularly beautiful female. So astonished was I, for I had given strict orders not to be disturbed that it was some moments before I found language to inquire the cause of her presence. A second, a third, and even a fourth time did I repeat my question, but received no answer from my mysterious visitor except a slight raising of her eyes. By this time I felt strange sensations spreading through me. I would have risen but the riveted gaze of the being before me rendered volition impossible. I assayed once more to address her, but my tongue itself had become paralyzed. A new influence, mysterious, potent, irresistible, took possession of me. All I could do was to gaze steadily, vacantly at my unknown visitant. Gradually the surrounding atmosphere seemed as though becoming filled with sensations, and grew luminous. Everything about me seemed to rarify, the mysterious vistor herself becoming more airy and yet more distinct to my sight than before. I now began to feel as one dying, or rather to experience the sensations which I have sometimes imagined accompany dissolution. I did not think, I did not reason, I did not move; All were alike impossible. I was only conscious of gazing fixedly, vacantly at my companion. \n\"Presently I heard a voice saying, 'Son of the Republic, look and learn,' while at the same time my visitor extended her arm eastwardly. I now beheld a heavy white vapor at some distance rising fold upon fold. This gradually dissipated, and I looked upon a strange scene. Before me lay spread out in one vast plain all the countries of the world--Europe, Asia, Africa and America. I saw rolling and tossing between Europe and America the billows of the Atlantic and between Asia and America lay the Pacific. 'Son of the Republic,' said the same mysterious voice as before, 'look and learn,' At that moment I beheld a dark, shadowy being, like an angel, standing, or rather floating in mid-air, between Europe and America. Dipping water out of the ocean in the hollow of each hand, he sprinkled some upon America with his right hand, While with his left hand he cast some on Europe. Immediately a cloud raised from these countries, and joined in mid-ocean. For a while it remained stationary, and then moved slowly westward, until it enveloped America in its murky folds. Sharp flashes of lightning gleamed through it at intervals, and I heard the smothered groans and cries of the American people. A second time the angel dipped water from the ocean, and sprinkled it out as before. The dark cloud was then drawn back to the ocean, in whose heaving billows it sank from view. A third time I heard the mysterious voice saying, 'Son of the Republic, look and learn,' I cast my eyes upon America and beheld villages and towns and cities springing up one after another until the whole land form the Atlantic to the Pacific was dotted with them. Again, I heard the mysterious voice say, 'Son of the Republic, the end of the century cometh, look and learn.' \n\"At this the dark shadowy angel turned his face southward, and from Africa I saw an ill-omened spectre approach our land. It flitted slowly over every town and city of the latter. The inhabitants presently set themselves in battle array against each other. As I continued looking I saw a bright angel, on whose brow rested a crown of light, on which was traced the word, 'Union,' bearing the American flag which he placed between the divided nation, and said, 'Remember ye are brethren.' Instantly, the inhabitants, casting from them their weapons became friends once more, and united around the National Standard. \"And again I heard the mysterious voice saying, 'Son of the Republic, look and learn,' At this the dark, shadowy angel placed a trumpet to his mouth, and blew three distinct blasts; and taking water from the ocean, he sprinkled it upon Europe, Asia and Africa. Then my eyes beheld a fearful scene; from each of these countries arose thick, black clouds that were soon joined into one. And throughout this mass there gleamed a dark red light by which I saw hordes of armed men, who, moving with the cloud, marched by land and sailed by sea to America, which country was enveloped in the volume of cloud. And I dimly saw these vast armies devastate the whole country and burn the villages, towns and cities that I beheld springing up. As my ears listened to the thundering cannon, clashing of swords, and the shouts and cries of millions in mortal combat, I again heard the mysterious voice saying, 'Son of the Republic, look and learn.' When the voice had ceased, the dark shadowy angel placed his trumpet once more to his mouth, and blew a long and fearful blast. \n\"Instantly a light as of a thousand suns shone down from above me, and pierced and broke into fragments the dark cloud which enveloped America. At the same moment the angel upon whose head still shone the word 'Union,' and who bore our national flag in one hand and a sword in the other, descended from the heavens attended by legions of white spirits. These immediately joined the inhabitants of America, who I perceived were well nigh overcome, but who immediately taking courage again, closed up their broken ranks and renewed the battle. Again, amid the fearful noise of the conflict, I heard the mysterious voice saying, 'Son of the Republic, look and learn,.' As the voice ceased the shadowy angel for the last time dipped water from the ocean and sprinkled it upon America. Instantly the dark cloud rolled back, together with the armies it had brought, leaving the inhabitants of the land victorious. \n\"Then once more I beheld the villages, towns and cities springing up where I had seen them before, while the bright angel, planting the azure standard he had brought in the midst of them cried with a loud voice: 'While the stars remain, and the heavens send down dew upon the earth, so long shall the Union last.\" And taking from his brow the crown on which blazoned the word 'Union,' he placed it upon the Standard while the people, kneeling down, said, 'Amen.' \n\"The scene instantly began to fade and dissolve, and I at last saw nothing but the rising, curling vapor I at first beheld. This also disappearing, I found myself once more gaping upon the mysterious visitor, who, in the same voice I had heard before, said, Son of the Republic, what you have seen is thus interpreted. 'Three great perils will come upon the Republic. The most fearful is the third passing which the whole world united shall not prevail against her. Let every child of the Republic learn to live for his God, his land and Union. With these words the vision vanished, and I startled from my seat and felt that I had seen a vision wherein had been shown me the birth, progress, and destiny of the United States.\" \n\"Such, my friends, concluded the venerable narrator, \"were the words I heard from Washington's own lips, and America will do well to profit by them.\"   \nWashington and Lafayette at Valley Forge, winter of 1777 - 1778. Copy of an engraving by H.B. Hall after Alzono Chappel. \nMore on Valley Forge and George Washington From the Editor:  Here are some nice excerpts describing Washington's tremendous faith in God and his extraordinary ability to not only talk the talk but walk the walk. He led by example. And because he did, God invested a more than ordinary amount of light and grace in him. The presence of God in him, re-enforced the faith in all his troops. After this excerpt the authors go on to describe Von Steubens's contribution to help mold the already steeled troops into a disciplined fighting force. It is an excellent book describing God's hand in America's destiny. \nExcerpts from:   The Light and the Glory  by Peter Marshall and David Manuel,  pp. 323-324. \n\"... the reason they endured--the reason they believed in God's deliverance--was simple: they could believe, because their General did believe. \n\"Washington made no secret of his Christian faith. In his general order calling for divine services every Sunday, he said: \"To the distinguished character of a Patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of a Christian.\" And others, such as pastor of a nearby Lutheran church. Henry Muhlenberg, would note his faith with approval:\" \"I heard a fine example today, namely, that His Excellency General Washington rode around among his army yesterday and admonished each and every one to fear God, to put away wickedness that has set in and become so general, and to practise the Christian virtues. From all appearances, this gentleman does not belong to the so-called world of society, for he respects God's Word, believes in the atonement through Christ, and bears himself in humility and gentleness. Therefore, the Lord God has also singularly, yea, marvelously, preserved him from harm in the midst of countless perils, ambuscades, fatigues, etc., and has hitherto graciously held him in His hand as a chosen vessel.\" \"When it came to prayer, however, Washington preferred to pray in private, and it is doubtful that he ever prayed more fervently than he did that winter. One of the number of accounts of people accidently discovering him in prayer involved the General's temporary landlord, Isaac Potts. ... \" [ see the story under the picture of \"The Prayer at Valley Forge,\" on the previous page. ] \n\"Something else happened that winter which says much about the quality of Washington's faith. A turncoat collaborator named Michael Wittman was captured, and at his trial, it was proven that he had given the British invaluable assistance on numerous occasions. He was found guilty of spying and sentenced to death by hanging. On the evening before the execution, an old man with white hair asked to wee Washington, giving his name as Peter Miller. He was ushered in without delay, for Miller had done a great many favors for the army. Now he had a favor to ask of Washington, who nodded agreeably. \n\"I've come to ask you to pardon Michael Wittman.\" \n\"Washington was taken aback. \"Impossible! Wittman has done all in his power to betray us, even offering to join the British and help destroy us.\" He shook his head. \"In these times we cannot be lenient with traitors; and for that reason I cannot pardon your friend.\" \n\"Friend! He's not friend of mine. He is my bitterest enemy. He has persecuted me for years. He has even beaten me and spit in my face, knowing full well that I would not strike back. Michael Wittman is not friend of mine!\" \nWashington was puzzled. \"And you still wish me to pardon him?\" \n\"I do. I ask it of you as a great personal favor.\" \n\"Why?\" \n\"I ask it because Jesus did as much for me.\" \nWashington turned away and walked into the next room. Soon he returned with a paper on which was written the pardon of Michael Wittman. \"My dear friend,\" he said, placing the paper in the old man's hand, \"I thank you for this.\" \nSuch charity did not weaken him in the army's eyes; the men loved him for it, as did his officers. NO one who had served with him could understand why there were generals and Congressmen who wanted to see him replaced. But then, the latter did not know how it was at Valley Forge. \"The greatest difficulty,\" said the young Marquis de Lafayette, \"was that, in order to conceal misfortunes form the enemy, it was necessary to conceal them from the nation also.\" \n\nhttp://www.reversespins.com/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

"text": "Dec 7 2017 \u00bb The Voting News \nThe head of President Donald Trump\u2019s election fraud commission drafted a law as a Kansas official that led to 23 disabled people not having their votes counted in a recent local election. The disenfranchisement occurred in Sedgwick County and was a direct result of a law pushed by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a member of Trump\u2019s voter fraud commission, which requires disabled voters\u2019 signatures on their ballot envelopes. Until Kobach\u2019s Secure and Fair Elections (SAFE) Act passed in 2011, ballots were not tossed if a disabled person\u2019s signature did not exactly match one on file or if someone else signed on behalf of a physically unable voter. As a result, 23 unsigned ballots from disabled people were tossed in a local election where only 24,120 votes were cast according to deputy elections commissioner Laura Bianco. Some of the races in the county were decided by far fewer than 23 votes. \n\u201cIf you\u2019re a person with quadriplegia or a senior and don\u2019t have the same ability to mark a ballot as you did when you were younger,\u201d the ballot would be thrown out, Rocky Nichols, executive director of the Disability Rights Center of Kansas, told Newsweek . \u201cIt\u2019s really a problem for people with disabilities. We need to get it fixed.\u201d \nJim Howell, a member of the Sedgwick County Commission, which acts as the board of canvassers, said he believes it is an \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of the law. \nDespite the result, Howell actually voted for the SAFE Act while on the state legislature, he told Newsweek .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim howell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "howell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura bianco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kris kobach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kobach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rocky nichols", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "disability rights center of kansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newsweek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sedgwick county commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sedgwick county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:18.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fb3d1b5c67e33bc703b56fc02fcb535df77e48a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSvACowzhkCBN0uV.hswME5YctHtcaVe8TBjHM.cACzvtV93FdfjU1Hw7LSvs_Q53d6J0rXj5_qMQ--", "site_full": "www.jobsearchdigest.com", "site": "jobsearchdigest.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/hedge-fund-jobs", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Job Search Digest", "title": "Associate - Business Development", "title_full": "Associate - Business Development", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fb3d1b5c67e33bc703b56fc02fcb535df77e48a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSvACowzhkCBN0uV.hswME5YctHtcaVe8TBjHM.cACzvtV93FdfjU1Hw7LSvs_Q53d6J0rXj5_qMQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Associate - Business Development", "text": "Associate \u2013 Business Development Los Angeles, CA \nRapidly expanding private equity firm.
