Abstract \nThis paper presents an optimization method for the design of the layout of an autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) fleet to minimize the drag force. The layout of the AUV fleet is defined by two nondimensional parameters. Firstly, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed on the fleets with different layout parameters and detailed information on the hydrodynamic forces and flow structures around the AUVs is obtained. Then, based on the CFD data, a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) method is used to describe the relationship between the layout parameters and the drag of the fleet. Finally, a genetic algorithm (GA) is chosen to obtain the optimal layout parameters which correspond to the minimum drag. The optimization results show that the total drag of the AUV fleet can be reduced by 12% when the follower AUV is located directly behind the leader AUV and the drag of the follower AUV can be reduced by 66% when it is by the side of the leader AUV. 1. Introduction \nAutonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are a kind of self-sailing, self-executing underwater robots, which play an important role in expanding people\u2019s knowledge of the ocean. AUVs are capable of a wide range of applications, such as pipeline inspection [ 1 , 2 ], underwater search and rescue, mine-sweeping [ 3 ], and oceanographic exploration [ 4 ]. The tasks of current AUVs are relatively single, and in the future, AUVs will be able to perform a variety of tasks. Therefore, AUVs will be composed of more complex structures and control systems, as well as more sensors and functional modules. Another solution for complex tasks is to use a fleet of simple AUVs, among which each one has a specific function, so that the fleet can complete complex tasks with simple AUVs and at a lower cost. \nWhen the AUVs travel in a fleet, the layout of the fleet becomes a key problem. Observations of animal motions such as birds in flocks suggest that some energy benefit may be obtained by certain fleet shapes [ 5 ]. It is known to all that migrating geese fly in a V or I formation for long distance migrations (Figure 1 ). The leader goose produces high speed updrafts in wake, which help the follower geese to save energy. Similarly, the leader AUV in the fleet produces low speed wake and low pressure side flows. Therefore, the follower AUVs could possibly use the velocity difference or pressure difference to minimize the drag and save energy. Figure 1: (a) Migrating geese and (b) possible layout of an AUV fleet. \nThe drag of an individual AUV can be reduced by optimizing the shape of the hull, propeller, and surface control [ 6 , 7 ]. Alvarez et al. introduced an optimization method for the shape optimization of an AUV moving near the water surface [ 8 ]. They used a panel model to predict the wave resistance of a revolution body and a simulated annealing algorithm to optimize the geometric parameters that minimize the wave resistance. Kim et al. proposed a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method for the optimization of monohull ships with the minimum drag [ 9 ]. Joung et al. proposed a procedure using the CFD method and a Design of Experiments (DOE) optimization for the hull optimization [ 10 ]. Sun et al. established an energy consumption model for an underwater glider and optimized the shape of the glider with a combined CFD and Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) method [ 11 ]. \nCFD simulations can predict the hydrodynamic performance of the AUV with high accuracy, however, at the cost of time. Combined optimization method based on the CFD, Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), and Genetic Algorithm (GA) can efficiently save the simulation time to obtain the optimal target. BPNN and GA are used at some of the nonlinear data to find the optimal value [ 12 , 13 ]. Safikhani et al. studied the multiobjective optimization of nanofluid flow in flat tubs, which combined with a CFD, artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithms [ 14 ]. They got important design information about nanofluids and flat tubes. Avc\u0131 et al. studied the optimization of the deign parameters of a home refrigerator using CFD and artificial neural network [ 15 ]; they showed that CFD simulation and the ANN can determine the best value for the refrigerator design. \nInspired by the above research, this paper introduces an optimization procedure of an AUV fleet, which contains two AUVs, to minimize its drag. The layout of the fleet is defined by two nondimensional parameters. Three-dimensional CFD simulations are performed to find the drag of each case. Then BPNN and GA optimization method is used to find the optimal layout which has the minimum drag. 2. Geometry Configuration 2.1. The AUV Hull Design \nThe AUV considered in this paper has a torpedo-like axisymmetric shape, which is characterized with a length of \u2009m and a maximum diameter of \u2009m, resulting in a slenderness ratio (the ratio of the length to the diameter) of 6.5. The two-dimensional sketch of the AUV is shown in Figure 2 . The designed AUV is composed of a nose section, a middle section, and a tail section. The lengths of the three sections are 0.2\u2009m, 0.7\u2009m, and 0.4\u2009m, respectively. In order to obtain a low-drag shape, the Myring Equation [ 17 ] is used to design the shape of the AUV nose. The Myring Equation is widely used in the design of AUV hulls [ 10 ]. The expression for the nose shape is determined by where is the position along the rotation axis, is the radius at a specific , and is the length of the nose. The tail section is smoothly transited from the mid-section to a circular cone, which has a cone angle of 30\u00b0. The diameter of the rear surface is 0.04\u2009m. Table 1 shows the values of the dimensional parameters. Table 1: Dimensional parameters of the AUV. Figure 2: Shape of the AUV. 2.2. Parameters of the AUV Fleet \nAs shown in Figure 3 , a coordinate frame is assigned to the nose of the leader AUV, with its horizontal axis pointing right and its vertical axis pointing to the side of the follower AUV. The layout of the AUV fleet can be characterized by two parameters, a and b , which represent the relative location of two adjacent AUVs in the fleet. To eliminate the dimensional effects, a and b are normalized by dividing the length of the AUV, where x f and y f are the position of the follower AUV in the proposed coordinate frame. Figure 3: Parameter definition for the AUV fleet. \nA series of fleet layouts can be described by changing the two design parameters, a and b . Before the optimization procedure, 53 groups of CFD simulations are performed as sample points with a varying from 0.00 to 0.60 and b varying from 0.00 to 2.00. It should be noted that simulations for and are not performed because of the geometric interference between the two AUVs in these situations. \nThis study aims optimize the drag of the AUV fleet. The drag is normalized in the following way: where are the drag coefficient of the leader AUV, the follower AUV, and the fleet, respectively, is the water density and is equal to 998\u2009kg/m 3 , is the area of the cross-section of the AUV, and is the velocity of the AUV. 3. CFD Method \nThe drag coefficients and the flow structures for each simulation case are obtained by the CFD approaches separately. A group of transient representations of the three-dimensional flow are carried out to improve the efficiency of the optimization process. Further, the results of this numerical model will be compared with existing experimental data for the model validation, which will be discussed in Section 3.4 . 3.1. Governing Equations \nThe prediction of the flow around the AUVs is based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations [ 18 ], where is the vector of velocity, is pressure, and refers to the stress tensor. \nThe shear stress transport (SST) k - \u03c9 turbulence model was selected to model the turbulence terms of the RANS equations [ 18 ]. The SST k - \u03c9 turbulence model is able to model the transport of turbulent shear stress and gives accurate predictions on the onset and amount of flow separation under adverse pressure gradients and has been successfully used in the CFD simulation of complex flows [ 11 , 19 \u2013 22 ]. 3.2. Computational Domain and Boundary Conditions \nThe computational domain is a finite space used to simulate the flow around the AUV. In order to minimize the effect of block caused by the AUV, a rectangular domain with a dimension of is selected, resulting in a maximum block ratio of 0.67%, as shown in Figure 4 . The length of the domain is and the leader AUV is placed in the mid-plane of the domain and to the left boundary. The follower AUV is in the same horizontal plane with the leader AUV and is offset in the coordinate frame. Figure 4: Computational domain and boundary conditions. \nSteady and uniform velocity inlet boundary is set at the left surface of the domain. The magnitude of the inflow velocity is 6\u2009m/s and a moderate turbulence intensity of 5% is chosen. Pressure outlet boundary is chosen for the right surface of the domain, which has the same turbulence intensity with the inlet boundary. Smooth wall conditions are imposed at the four-side surfaces, where the shear effects are neglected to minimize the influences of the walls. Standard wall conditions are applied to the surfaces of both AUVs. 3.3. Mesh Generation \nIn order to obtain more accurate results with smaller number of grids, the computational domain is meshed with structured hexahedral grids, as shown in Figure 5 . Because the flow around the AUVs is more complex and has higher velocity gradients, a higher density of grid is set in this place to capture the development of flow with accuracy. Particularly, prism layer grid elements (Figure 5(c) ) are generated from the wall surfaces to refine the mesh quality near the boundary layer flows. The initial height of the prism layer above the wall surfaces is an important indicator for the quality of the mesh. In this study, we use the nondimensional value to evaluate the quality of the prism layer and a maximum value of 1 is chosen for all meshes. For a smoother transition of the adjacent elements, a general mesh growth rate of 1.2 is chosen for all grids. Figure 5: Details of the computation mesh: (a) overview; (b) grids around the vehicle; and (c) prism layer grid elements. 3.4. Verification and Validation \nA mesh verification study is carried out to determine the proper density of mesh. The verification simulations are performed on a single AUV with different meshes. Three meshes, with approximately 3.76 million (fine mesh), 2.80 million (mediate mesh), and 1.67 million (coarse mesh) elements, respectively, are generated for the grid resolution verification. The drag coefficients obtained by the three meshes are listed in Table 2 . It is found that the coarse mesh predicts slightly higher and the other two give almost the same results. Therefore, the mediate mesh is chosen for the following simulations. It should be noted that, for the simulations of the AUV fleet, the grid density is kept the same with that of the single AUV and the number of elements is about 5.5 million due to the increased number of AUVs. Table 2: Results of the mesh verification study. \nA validation study is performed for the validation of the proposed numerical model. Simulations are performed according to an experiment of twin parallel bare prolate spheroids with transverse separations [ 16 ] ( a varies and in current study), as shown in Figure 6 . The length of the model was 1.2\u2009m and the maximum diameter was 0.2\u2009m, which is very close to the size of the AUV in this study. The testing inlet velocity was 40\u2009m/s, corresponding to a Reynolds number of according to the length of the model. This Reynolds number was also close to the current simulation. The calculated coefficients of drag and side force of the top spheroid are then compared with those obtained by experiment [ 16 ] and a previous CFD study [ 23 ] (Figure 7 ). It is noticed that the current CFD model provides more accurate results than that presented by Molland and Utama [ 23 ]. The maximum relative errors of the predicted drag and side force are 3.3% and 9.1%, respectively. This proves that the CFD model in this study can predict the forces of two AUVs with acceptable accuracy. Figure 6: Wind tunnel test of the twin spheroids [ 16 ]. Figure 7: Results of the validation study: (a) coefficients of drag and (b) coefficients of side force. 4. Optimal Design Method \nThis paper establishes an optimization method based on the combination of CFD method, BPNN and GA. The drag coefficients and the flow structures for 53 different layouts are obtained by the CFD approaches separately. The results are then used to build the agent model between and the design parameters () using BPNN. Finally, GA is applied to search for the optimal together with the values for the corresponding design parameters based on the agent model. 4.1. BP Neural Network \nThe artificial neural network is widely accepted as an alternative to providing solutions to complex and ambiguous problems [ 24 , 25 ]. In this study, a back-propagation algorithm that optimizes weighted connections by allowing errors to propagate from the output layer to the input layer is used to train the network. The topology of the BPNN in present study is shown in Figure 8 . The structure has two input layers, five hidden layers and one output layer. Each node of the structure represents a neuron, and the nodes between the layers and the layers are connected by weights. Figure 8: The topology of the BPNN. \nThe BPNN is working based on the following principle: \nAccording to CFD simulation results, determine the network input data and output data . is the data matrix of the hidden layer, as can be seen in where are the numbers of inputs, outputs, hidden layers, and the training samples, respectively. \nThe outputs of the hidden layer are obtained by where is the connection between the input layer and the hidden layer. \nThe predicted outputs of the BPNN can be obtained by where is the connection between the hidden layer and the output layer. \nAccording to the network forecast output and the expected output , calculate the network prediction error . \nThe weights are updated according to the network prediction error (). is the learning efficiency of BPNN. \nThe thresholds are updated according to the network prediction error . \n(7) Return to step if the optimization is still running. \nIt is noted that all the iterative processes of the BP neural network have a mean square error (MSE). In addition, the average accuracy of the prediction is defined by Kreith (2000). In other words, represents the goodness of fit, which is used to measure the correlation between prediction output data and training samples data. The closer it is to the value of 1, the better the training network is. 4.2. Genetic Algorithm \nIn this paper, the GA tool in MATLAB is used for the optimization, which runs in the following principle: (1) Initialize the population, calculate the fitness value, and find the best chromosome from the population. (2) Iterative optimization: (a) Select: first, the solution to the problem is encoded by using the floating-point encoding. This function selects the chromosomes in each generation population for subsequent crossover and mutation. The method used is the roulette selection method. (b) Crossover: this function is a random selection of two chromosomes, according to determine the crossover probability to determine whether the cross, and the cross position is also random. (c) Mutation: this function performs the mutation operation. The mutation chromosomes and mutated positions are randomly selected. Finally, it will check the feasibility of chromosomes; otherwise, it will be recompiled. (d) Result analysis. \nThe optimal solution can be found after several generations. The establishment of BPNN approximate model and the numerical optimization of the genetic algorithm are shown in Figure 9 . Figure 9: Neural network and genetic algorithm flowchart. 5. CFD Results 5.1. Force Performance \nIn order to more intuitively show the influences of the fleet layout on the drags of the two AUVs, the coefficients of drags are expressed in a nondimensional drag ratio by dividing of a single AUV (0.0774 in Table 2 ): \nThe drag ratios for the 53 different fleet layouts are shown in Figure 10 . The configuration of the AUV fleet can be divided into four regions depending on the drag ratios: the Parallel Region, the Pull Region, the Push Region, and the Tandem Region. Figure 10: Drag ratios for different AUV fleet layouts. 5.2. Parallel Region \nThe Parallel Region locates at . AUVs in this region generate a higher drag than that in an infinite domain. Besides, the drag ratios for both AUVs are almost the same as each other due to the symmetrical geometric positions. For example, the drag ratios of AUVs at and are 5.52% higher than that of a single AUV. It can also be observed that as the latitudinal offset increases, the drag ratios gradually reduce. At and , the drags of the AUVs are only approximately 0.6% higher than that of a single AUV. These results are consistent with previous studies [ 16 , 26 ] which suggested a minimum latitudinal offset of to preclude the interactions between two AUVs. \nThe contours of pressure and velocity around the two parallel AUVs are shown in Figure 11 . Three different latitudinal offsets, , 0.4, and 0.6, are presented and compared. It can be seen from the figure that the velocity of the fluid is obviously increased in the range between the two AUVs. According to Bernoulli\u2019s Equation, larger fluid velocity corresponds to lower pressure, which can be verified by the pressure distributions in Figure 11(b) . For example, in the pressure diagram of , the pressure on the nose of the AUV is significantly reduced, which eventually leads to an increase in the drag. As increases, the interactions between the AUVs get weaker and the drag of the AUV is gradually restored to normal levels. Figure 11: Contours of (a) velocity and (b) pressure around two parallel AUVs at different latitudinal offsets. 5.3. Tandem Region \nThe Tandem Region is where the follower AUV locates just behind the leader AUV (). The drag ratios of the AUVs in this region are greatly reduced, especially for the leader AUV. For example, at and , the drag reduction is 6.18% for the leader AUV and is 2.52% for the follower AUV. It should be noted that the follower AUV experiences an 9.72% increase in drag at and , but the total drag of the AUV fleet reduces. \nThe contours of pressure and velocity around the two tandem AUVs are shown in Figure 12 . Three different longitudinal offsets, , 1.50, and 1.75, are presented and compared. When the follower AUV is located in tandem in the wake of the leader AUV, a certain amount of pressure is recovered on the tail of the leader AUV, which contributes to the reduction of the pressure drag of the leader AUV, while for the follower AUV, the velocity of the upstream flow is reduced by the leader AUV, resulting in a reduction of the nose pressure and a decrease in final resistance. Figure 12: Contours of (a) velocity and (b) pressure around two parallel AUVs at different latitudinal offsets. 5.4. Pull Region \nThe Pull Region is where the drag of the leader AUV is increased and that of the follower AUV is reduced. The Pull Region mainly locates between and . In this region, it is likely that the leader AUV pulls the follower AUV to move, so that the drag of the leader AUV is increased and the drag of the follower AUV changes oppositely. \nThe contours of pressure and velocity around the two AUVs in the Pull Region are shown in Figure 13 . Three different locations with , 0.3, and 0.4, , 0.50, and 0.75, respectively, are presented and compared. The longitudinal offset is within one AUV length and the nose of the follower AUV locates at the lower pressure region by the side of the leader AUV. Under the effects of the follower AUV, the pressure on the side surface of the leader AUV is reduced, resulting in an augment in the drag. Besides, as the increases, the interactions between the two AUVs are weaker and the variation in the drags of both AUVs is smaller. Figure 13: Contours of (a) velocity and (b) pressure around two AUVs in the Pull Region. 5.5. Push Region \nThe Push Region is where the drag of the leader AUV is reduced and that of the follower AUV is augmented. The Push Region mainly locates between and . In this region, it is likely that the follower AUV pushes the leader AUV to move, so that the drag of the leader AUV is reduced and the drag of the follower AUV changes oppositely. \nThe contours of pressure and velocity around the two AUVs in the Push Region are shown in Figure 14 . Three different locations with , 0.3, and 0.4, , 1.50, and 1.75, respectively, are presented and compared. The reason for the variation of the drags on the two AUVs can be explained. The obstacle flow around the nose of the follower AUV hinders the separation on the tail of the leader AUV; therefore, a certain amount of pressure is recovered on the tail of the leader AUV, which contributes to a reduction of the pressure drag of the leader AUV. A reaction force is then applied to the follower AUV, leading to an increase in the drag on the follower AUV. Figure 14: Contours of (a) velocity and (b) pressure around two AUVs in the Pull Region. 5.6. Data for the BPNN Training Samples \nThe predicted drag ratios for the AUV fleet obtained by CFD are given in Table 3 . It should be noted that 10 samples for and are added to complete an orthographical sample domain. Since it is nonphysical to arrange the two AUVs in this area, a high drag ratio of 2.0000 is assigned to the AUV which locates in this region. Therefore, there are 63 samples in total for the training of the BPNN. Table 3: CFD data for the training samples. 6. Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm Optimization 6.1. Optimization of the AUV Fleet \nWhen the AUV fleet executes tasks underwater, a minimum drag is expected so that the fleet will work for a longer time and a wider range. Therefore, the layout of the AUV fleet should be optimized to obtain a minimum drag. 6.1.1. Neural Network Training \nUsing the data in Table 3 , training of the BPNN is carried out until the network meets the intended target. A comparison between the predicted data and the expected data is shown in Figure 15 . The training network predicts drag ratios with good agreement with the CFD data. Therefore, it can be said that the BPNN successfully model and predict the drag ratio of the AUV fleet. Figure 15: Comparisons of the drag ratio of the AUV fleet by BPNN and CFD. 6.1.2. Comparisons of the Optimal Drag between CFD and BPNN \nA CFD simulation of the AUV fleet for the optimal parameters is carried out for the comparisons between the two methods. The optimal results are shown in Table 4 . The results of the BPNN and the CFD method are very close, with a relative error of 0.66%, which further validates the accuracy of the BPNN. The optimal drag ratio is obtained at and , where the follower AUV is directly behind the Leading AUV, and the optimal drag ratio of the AUV fleet is 1.8825, which means that the total drag of the AUV fleet is reduced by approximately 12%. Table 4: Comparisons of the optimal drag ratio of the AUV fleet between CFD and BPNN. \nTo further investigate the flow structures of the optimal fleet layout, Figure 16 compares the pressure contours around the optimal AUV fleet and that of a single AUV. The most obvious difference between these two cases is the pressure distribution on the tail of the leader AUV. Due to the block effect of the follower AUV, the pressure on the tail of the leader AUV is recovered. This variation can be clearly observed in the pressure distributions in Figure 17 . Figure 16: Contours of pressure around the AUV: (a) single AUV and (b) optimal AUV fleet. Figure 17: Pressure distributions along the longitudinal direction of the AUV: (a) single AUV and (b) optimal AUV fleet. 6.2. Optimization of the Follower AUV \nAlthough the optimal fleet layout analyzed in Section 6.2 characterizes with the minimum drag, the drag of the follower AUV is not the optimal value. Among the AUVs in a fleet, it is possible that leader AUV is designed with high propulsive performance and the other follower AUVs obtain lower propulsion costs at the expense of the leader AUV. Therefore, the optimal layout of the fleet for the best performance of the follower AUV should be studied. 6.2.1. Neural Network Training \nUsing the data in Table 3 , training of the BPNN is carried out until the network meets the intended target. A comparison between the predicted data and the expected data for the follower AUV is shown in Figure 18 . As can be seen from the figure, the training network predicts drag ratios with good agreement with the CFD data. Figure 18: Comparisons of the drag ratio of the follower AUV by BPNN and CFD. 6.2.2. Comparisons of the Optimal Drag between CFD and BPNN \nBased on the network after the training process, the optimal output drag ratio of the follower AUV is predicted using the BPNN model. Typically, a CFD simulation for the optimal parameters is carried out for the comparisons between the two methods. The optimal results are shown in Table 5 . Table 5 suggests that the results of the BPNN and the CFD method are very close, with a relative error of 1.87%, which further validates the accuracy of the BPNN. The optimal drag ratio is obtained at and , where the AUV fleet is in the Pull Region. The optimal drag ratio of the follower AUV is 0.3417, which means that the drag of the follower AUV is reduced by approximately 66%. Table 5: Comparisons of the optimal drag ratio of the follower AUV between CFD and BPNN. \nFigure 19 compares the pressure contours around the optimal AUV fleet and that of a single AUV. The most obvious difference between these two cases is the pressure distribution around the nose of the follower AUV. At this position, the nose of the follower AUV is influenced by the negative pressure on the inside surface of the leader AUV, so that a smaller pressure is obtained. This can also be observed in the pressure distributions in Figure 20 . Figure 19: Contours of pressure around the AUV: (a) single AUV and (b) optimal AUV fleet. Figure 20: Pressure distributions along the longitudinal direction of the AUV: (a) single AUV and (b) optimal AUV fleet. 7. Conclusions \nThe drag of the AUV fleet significantly influences the operating time and range of underwater vehicles. In this study, an optimization method is proposed to find the optimal layout of the AUV fleet which has the minimum drag. A combined method of CFD simulation, BPNN, and GA method is utilized for the optimization of the AUV fleet. Important conclusions of this study include the following: \nThe CFD results show that the drags of the AUVs in the fleet are determined by the relative position of the two AUVs. The layout of the fleet can be categorized into four different regions based on the drag behavior of the two AUVs: the Parallel Region, the Tandem Region, the Pull Region, and the Push Region. The variation of the drags of the AUVs is the result of the interacting flow and pressure change on the two AUVs. \nThe optimal layout parameters for the minimum fleet drag are and , where the fleet is in the Tandem Region and predicts a drag approximately 12% lower than that of a single AUV. \nThe optimal layout parameters for the minimum drag of the follower AUV are and , where the fleet is in the Pull Region and predicts a drag approximately 66% lower than that of a single AUV.

Weekend - TFMR - Discussion - People - Metals Over the past weekend at TFMR, we had a discussion about how so many well-intentioned people could have been so wrong about \"the metals\" over the past five years. It included this sentence: \"What we failed to predict was the successful, collective manipulation of nearly all \"markets\" by the CBs, their primary dealers and their willing/sycophant media through HFT.\"That one sentence could be the subject of a full post or podcast but, for now, let's just focus upon the market manipulation through HFT. As you know by now, the USDJPY is just about the single most important general input for HFT buy/sell decisions. Whether it's S&P futures, bond futures or Comex Gold, the direction of the USDJPY generally impacts all of these \"markets\" more than anything else. The chart below plots the inverse of USDJPY (JPYUSD) with gold futures. Note clear correlation that began in 2008. Bank - Market - Manipulation - Pattern - Pattern In observing the central bank market manipulation...when we see the same pattern again and again...and this pattern is followed by the desired equity or bond market reaction...then you know something is up. How many times have we captured screenshots of the BoJ, Fed, SNB or whomever buying the USDJPY in size at just the right moment to create and paint a double bottom on the chart? From there, how many times have we watched a near perfect and uninterrupted, 45-degree angle recovery ensue?Well, since we just used the term \"egregious\", let's apply it again to the charts below. Recall that things were sailing along surprisingly well last Monday.

Just as the negotiations appeared to be reaching a conclusion, the DUP applied the brakes. It was a disaster for the Prime Minister\u2019s already shredded authority and the long-term prospects of a Brexit deal, but it is also troubling that no one appeared to consider one of the most obvious problems: the consequences for Scotland . \nThose consequences became obvious almost as soon as the deal emerged. According to the draft, there would be \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d between Northern Ireland and the Republic, but Nicola Sturgeon wasted no time in saying that if a special deal was possible for Northern Ireland, then Scotland should get one too. \nNow a further challenge to Mrs May has come from within her own party, with the leader of the Scottish Conservatives Ruth Davidson saying that those who supported Brexit were not voting for different deals for the home nations. \u201cIf regulatory alignment in a number of specific areas is the requirement for a frictionless border, then the Prime Minister should conclude this must be on a UK-wide basis,\u201d she said. \n \nWhat Ms Davidson says makes perfect sense. Everyone recognises that there are special circumstances that apply in Northern Ireland and that everything must be done to avoid a return to the borders of the past, but the deal that was on the table earlier this week was a failure of logic, diplomacy, and political common sense. Who knows if the DUP were properly consulted, but the fact that they were able to put the kibosh on the deal exposes the inherent weakness of Theresa May, a PM pulled in different directions but going nowhere. \nThe deal also failed to consider the Scottish dimension, which is worrying for those, such as Ms Davidson, who are concerned about protecting the union of the UK. It was obvious \u2013 or it should have been \u2013 that the SNP would cause mischief with the deal. But, had it gone ahead, a regulatory deal for Northern Ireland would also have created important economic differences with the other UK nations. \nAnd did Mrs May really expect to get away with a deal that would effectively allow Northern Ireland to remain within the single market and customs union while keeping the rest of the UK out? We know that the DUP will never support such an arrangement (and when the DUP speaks, the PM must listen), which leaves only one alternative. If a hard Brexit for most of the UK and a soft Brexit for Northern Ireland is out of the running because of the DUP, and a hard Brexit for the whole of the UK including Northern Ireland is out because of the border issue, that leaves only a soft Brexit for all of the UK. And the problem with that is worryingly familiar: trying to leave the EU while also trying to keep most of its benefits. \nMrs May might yet be able to pull it off, but on the evidence of the last few days, the signs are not good.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "davidson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruth davidson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicola sturgeon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dup", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:55.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2fa91cb547e14d770fe1397189a9dcb19956f4c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPenp74J5MgLlYcluGu6u5kUyXRzuB0xRA15xWXK8U_0NCUuPX4n8lVm84VPWLvlas_mDLvmjNF9E", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g293961-i8983-Sri_Lanka.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Sri Lanka Forum, Travel Discussion for Sri Lanka - TripAdvisor", "title": "Flood update - Sri Lanka", "title_full": "Flood update - Sri Lanka Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-07T09:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6edd018db6c4ea160929d805949488ee5d611f46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPenp74J5MgLlYcluGu6u5kUyXRzuB0xRA15xWXK8U_0NCUuPX4n8lVm84VPWLvlas3YA3Rl6RzSRJ1w3dveHiAI-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "SeekingPlaces", "published": "2017-12-07T10:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Which news is this?

in the college sector, the hope in recent months was that a deal had finally been reached on lecturers\u2019 pay. But it would seem the hope was premature. \nThe basics of the deal are good: lecturers will receive an average rise of nine per cent, with some receiving much more because of historic pay anomalies. Lecturers will also receive some extra holidays. It will mean salaries of up to \u00a340,000 and 62 days of holiday a year. \nHowever, the talks now appear to have broken down over a \u00a31,000 annual rise which the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) says is needed to cover the rise in living costs, but the real problem is that colleges are struggling to implement the Scottish Government \u2019s policy to harmonise lecturers\u2019 pay across the sector. \n \nThe policy of harmonisation itself is sound, but what is a policy without proper funding? In the years since the SNP came to power, college funding has been dramatically reduced; the merger process has also led to job cuts, financial support for students has been cut, and the numbers going to college has declined. \nTo top it all, the latest dispute over pay represents yet another tightening of the screw. Pay rises for college lecturers are well deserved and long overdue, but the SNP should not expect colleges to pay for the promises that it has made.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "snp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "educational institute of scotland", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:56.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f503aba60d7efb15c385c099710a2721cc9c2725", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTh8JEu81K5aFWHJ0wJeAvhIEor6P73ecp_5njj5rUu3nwu3mv0nmRh7t.MeFX1ipY-", "site_full": "sciencebusiness.technewslit.com", "site": "technewslit.com", "site_section": "http://sciencebusiness.technewslit.com/?feed=rss2", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Science and Enterprise", "title": "How to Design a Warehouse Perfect for Your Needs", "title_full": "How to Design a Warehouse Perfect for Your Needs", "published": "2017-12-06T23:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f503aba60d7efb15c385c099710a2721cc9c2725", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTh8JEu81K5aFWHJ0wJeAvhIEor6P73ecp_5njj5rUu3nwu3mv0nmRh7t.MeFX1ipY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alan", "published": "2017-12-06T23:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "How to Design a Warehouse Perfect for Your Needs", "text": "How to Design a Warehouse Perfect for Your Needs   \u2013 Contributed content \u2013 (Flickr) \n6 December 2017. If you\u2019ve had an amazing idea for a product, you will need somewhere to manufacture and store it, ready for sale to your customers. For many businesses, buying a warehouse is a simple process, but for your more complex needs, you may need to look into how you can fully optimize a space to get the most from your square footage. \nA warehouse isn\u2019t just about storing products and parts, though, you also need to make sure that your warehouse staff will be safe in their working environment and that any risk of accident is minimized as far as possible. This will certainly influence the layout and design of your warehouse and thinking about this now will help you to save money and lives in the long term. \nMake use of mezzanine levels \nIf you have a high ceiling, installing mezzanine levels is a really good idea. You will essentially increase your floor space without having to expand your footprint which is a much more efficient use of space and will likely end up being cheaper than bigger premises. \nYou can use a forklift truck to ensure the safe movement and storage of your stock and even have staff up there to guide things into place. A simple way to ensure their safety is to install pivoting mezzanine safety gates which will ensure that there is always a gate between your employee and a potential fall. \nConsider layout and movement \nYes, it is obvious, but you do need to make sure that if you are using forklifts, they are able to move between the units in your warehouse and there is enough space for them to safely maneuver. The best way to do this is to create a floor plan that is roughly to scale to see what the best way of fitting everything in is. \nAnother thing to consider is how you want everyone to safely move around the warehouse. This could be another simple thing like marking colored lines on the floor to indicate where people can walk and where forklifts can drive . You should also mark out walkways around the warehouse to indicate where the safest places to stand are. \nUse tech to optimize processes \nThere are all sorts of warehouse and logistics technologies you can use to optimize your processes while making the warehouse safer. However, the future is also looking bright for further developments in warehouse tech. \nOne of the most common causes of accidents in a warehouse are forklift trucks which can topple over, emit carbon monoxide and be mishandled. Every year 95,000 warehouse employees are injured and 100 employees are killed in forklift related incidents, giving a clear indication that there is room for technological intervention in this area. \nThere are already plenty of pick and place robots and human-friendly forklifts that are capable of doing these jobs effectively but due to the number of other modification required to let them do their job, they haven\u2019t really caught on yet. \nWatch this space, though, the future of industry is right around the corner. * * *", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:56.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d48a3a493aa4165c0c066c4137020753e89b516a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9k72.YxEPp6L7PEdG0tZI9SFLAsF26W9WZAEW1jlNGpuTS7xE8FK5Ze_q35xOG2Rn4VhpJGCMLO8xUoRsVyr_3uSecG0214Kwv0gk85noo_Q--", "site_full": "worldwidejops.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://worldwidejops.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WORLD WIDE JOPS", "title": "Google Alert - Fashion Jobs in New York", "title_full": "Google Alert - Fashion Jobs in New York", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d48a3a493aa4165c0c066c4137020753e89b516a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9k72.YxEPp6L7PEdG0tZI9SFLAsF26W9WZAEW1jlNGpuTS7xE8FK5Ze_q35xOG2Rn4VhpJGCMLO8xUoRsVyr_3uSecG0214Kwv0gk85noo_Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jop Online (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Alert - Fashion Jobs in New York", "text": "Fashion Jobs in New York Daily update \u22c5 December 7, 2017 NEWS LeBook Business Development Job for Trend Setter Media Jobs ... from the worlds of fashion , & luxury advertising.

economic prosperity in the country. \nBMP Chairman Mian Anjum Nisar has called for revisiting country\u2019s trade policy as country exports decline in three years, citing that even Bangladesh exports jumped from US $ 24 billion to US $36 billion. \nHe said: \u201cWe want to fully support the government\u2019s initiatives aimed at promotion of trade and industry, however, the government should also resolve our problems on priority.\u201d \nHe mentioned that chambers of commerce and trade associations should have been consulted while imposing regulatory duty on 731 items, adding that it could increase of cost of doing business and encourage smuggling. \nMian Anjum also thanked the government for speedy completion of projects under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). \nHe also called for making Special Economic Zones (SEZ) offered in CPEC functional as early as possible so that private sector of Pakistan may construct industries there. \nThe BMP Chairman also called upon the Federal Board of Revenue to put in place a workable mechanism to release sales tax claims which was much needed to rotate the financial circle of the businessmen. 2017-12-07", "highlightText": "",

Retailing for \u20b914,999, the phone features robust hardware and uncluttered software thanks to Xiaomi\u2019s collaboration with Google over the Android One initiative. For the next two days, the phone is available for just \u20b912,999 , a discount of \u20b92,000 from its retail price. \nThe promotion is valid on Flipkart as well as Xiaomi\u2019s own Mi.com portal , and is valid on all three color variants of the phone \u2014 Black, Gold, and Rose Gold. \nAs a refresher, the Mi A1 comes with a 5.5-inch Full HD display, Snapdragon 625 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, microSd slot, dual 12MP cameras at the back with a wide-angle primary lens augmented by a telephoto shooter, 5MP front shooter, and a 3080mAh battery. The phone has no issues delivering a day\u2019s worth of usage on a full charge, and the camera is one of the best in this category. \nThen there\u2019s the software experience, which makes using the Mi A1 a delight. The phone offers a pure Android interface, with a few additions from Xiaomi in the form of the Mi Camera app (to take full advantage of the dual cameras), Mi Feedback to submit feedback about the device, and the Mi Remote app to control devices in your house through the IR blaster. \nXiaomi is set to kick off the Oreo beta test soon , with a stable Oreo update slaeted to arrive before the end of the year. Overall, there isn\u2019t a phone in this segment that offers as much value as the Mi A1, and the \u20b92,000 discount makes it an even more enticing option.

This year till November, KPRA has generated Rs5billion taxes against its set target of Rs13.6billion\u201d, he added. \nThe session was informed that the KPRA was successful in generating Rs6.2billion against its set target of Rs6billion in its first year of inception. \nIn 2014-15, the KPRA collected Rs6.2billion against Rs12billion target, in 2015-16 Rs7.27billion were collected against its target of Rs8billion whereas in 2016-17 Rs10.27billion were generated against its target of Rs10billion. \nCurrently efforts are underway for transparent recruitment of officers from BPS 1 to 19. According to KPRA Director HR Arshad Afridi, the authority is focusing on enhancing the credibility and transparency in the recruitment process for gaining public trust. \nMoreover in the current year, donor support projects have also been initiated along with developing the organizational structure including establishment of directorates and collectorates. \nTahir Aurakzai added that the authority has the potential to generate between Rs 30-40 billion per year once the authority is fully functional adding that the KPRA is set to become the largest contributor in terms of adding revenue to the provincial kitty. 2017-12-07", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arshad afridi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tahir aurakzai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kpra tahir aurakzai", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kpra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khyber pakhtunkhwa revenue authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan academy for rural development", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "peshawar", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:58.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce7a6fb379767432a7da78ff8e0752a647e7554a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.C3cR4n4_dTSb6h3Em6f3g8j6mWUHtFvjZpXmXOqSgX43sUxSay49D", "site_full": "www.designsonthetruth.com", "site": "designsonthetruth.com", "site_section": "http://www.designsonthetruth.com/?feed=rss2", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Designs on the Truth", "title": "To bake or not to bake; freedom from coercion?", "title_full": "To bake or not to bake; freedom from coercion?", "published": "2017-12-05T05:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.designsonthetruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MasterpieceCake2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce7a6fb379767432a7da78ff8e0752a647e7554a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.C3cR4n4_dTSb6h3Em6f3g8j6mWUHtFvjZpXmXOqSgX43sUxSay49D", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "m.k.wojcik", "published": "2017-12-05T05:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "To bake or not to bake; freedom from coercion?", "text": "Posted on December 4, 2017 \nThis week in Washington D.C. a critically important legal precedent will be set \u2013 for good or ill. In the next few days we\u2019ll learn whether the Supreme Court will reaffirm our rights under the First Amendment \u2013 or side with the Gay stapo. Tomorrow, the top court will hear the Jack Phillips\u2019 case. Alliance Defending Freedom is representing Jack and his Colorado bake shop. Here are the basics ~ \nJack is a Christian cake artist and owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado. One summer afternoon two men came into his shop asking him to design a wedding cake for their same-sex wedding. Jack politely declined, just as he would have done in response to a request for a Halloween cake, an anti-American cake, a racist cake, or even a cake celebrating a divorce. Jack\u2019s view of marriage, shaped by the Bible, would not allow him to use his artistic talents to celebrate an event in conflict with that view. But he did offer to sell them anything else in his shop or to design a cake for a different event instead. The offer to serve them in another way \u2013 a way that does not violate his conscience \u2013 was not enough. Later, the couple came back to picket his cakeshop and then sued him. The case has been ongoing for the past five years. \nWhy not just go to another bakery? Because there\u2019s an agenda to push. Not only are we Christians (- and one would presume Muslims as well \u2013 though oddly enough they\u2019re never targeted\u2026) not allowed to be critical of homosexual marriage, we must publicly affirm it \u2013 even though God says it\u2019s sinful. \nIn a recent article, Why the Masterpiece Cake Case Matters to All Americans, Dr. Michael Brown lays out some specifics, explaining why the Supremes should find in Phillips\u2019 favor ~ \nThe Alliance Defending Freedom , which is defending Phillips, has pointed out that: 1. \u201cJack does not discriminate,\u201d and he was perfectly happy to sell the gay couple, who subsequently took him to court, cookies and brownies and anything else pre-made off of his shelves; 2. \u201cJack has turned down other cakes in the past,\u201d including Halloween cakes and lewd cakes; 3. \u201cJack has faced anti-religious bigotry as well as threats and intimidation simply because he declined to promote an event,\u201d so he is the one being singled out for unfair treatment; 4. \u201cJack owns a private family business, and he doesn\u2019t give up his rights when he sells his art,\u201d and by calling his business \u201cMasterpiece Cakes,\u201d he is making clear that for him, they are works of art; 5. Accordingly, \u201cJack\u2019s shop has been called an \u2018art gallery of cakes\u2019\u2019; 6. \u2018Wedding cakes made up about 40 percent of Jack\u2019s business,\u2019 and these are all custom designed. But due to Colorado\u2019s laws and legal rulings to date, he has had to drop this part of his business entirely [\u2026] \nIn the days ahead, many on the left will argue that Phillips was guilty of discriminating against gay customers. But that is a complete misrepresentation of the facts, and if the Supreme Court finds him guilty, the implications for America will be massive. It will mean that the highest court in the land has ruled that, in virtually all conceivable cases, gay rights trump religious rights. And it will mean that Christians in particular can be forced to violate their consciences and their deeply held, historic beliefs under penalty of law, with the real potential of losing their very livelihoods. And should they still refuse to comply, it could mean a jail sentence too. \nAmendment I ~ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack phillips", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phillips", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supremes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alliance defending freedom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phillips", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lakewood", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:58.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0296034684b630cc6240ba448d73168b309f8850", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW1xf7ieD78V08ldQuj73MdRiG64.GxqzYocTIa7Ck2SwBu76SmGXogU3Lws1LTzxdz0I9dZVHa5A--", "site_full": "news.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/news?query=a&start=22&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "", "title": "CHINA MALDIVES DIPLOMACY", "title_full": "CHINA MALDIVES DIPLOMACY : \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ub274\uc2a4", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "KS", "spam_score": 0.971, "main_image": "http://imgnews.naver.net/image/origin/091/2017/12/07/6217141.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0296034684b630cc6240ba448d73168b309f8850", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW1xf7ieD78V08ldQuj73MdRiG64.GxqzYocTIa7Ck2SwBu76SmGXogU3Lws1LTzxdz0I9dZVHa5A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EPA\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4 | \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ub274\uc2a4", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "CHINA MALDIVES DIPLOMACY", "text": "President of the Maldives Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom visits China\nPresident of the Maldives Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom (L) and China's President Xi Jinping (R) arrive for a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, 07 December 2017.

It is often caused by organic diseases. The present case involved an appendiceal intussusception without an organic disease, and laparoscopic resection of part of the cecum was performed. Appendiceal intussusception has various causes, including malignant diseases. Therefore, diagnosis and selection of operative method are complex and could potentially lead to an excessively invasive option. By performing SILS with a multiuse single-site port, we were able to provide an appropriate, non-invasive treatment that had a good esthetic outcome.\n\n\nfrom #Esophageal Cancer via a.lsfakia on

Advertisement \n\"This is Australia: Fair, diverse, loving and filled for respect for everyone,\" said an effusive Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, as he introduced the bill for a final vote. \n\"This is a great day, it belongs to every Australian.\" \nThe move follows a two-month national postal survey that showed 61% of more than 12 million respondents were in favor of marriage equality. \nThe country is now the 24th in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry, according to Pew Research. \nAustralia's first same-sex weddings will not take place until at least January, however, due to a longstanding requirement for all Australian couples to provide a full month's notice of their intention to get married. \nHistoric moment \nMarriage equality campaigners have fought for years for Thursday's vote. Though the bill was expected to pass into law without significant opposition, the lengthy legislative process was excruciatingly slow for the hundreds of advocates watching from the public gallery. \nAmong them was Christine Forster, the gay sister of Tony Abbott, the former Australian Prime Minister who has long been seen as the face of the \"no\" campaign. \nForster was joined in the public gallery by her partner, Virginia Edwards. They plan to marry next year, and Abbott has said he'll attend despite his personal views. \nAbbott and other conservatives proposed amendments to the bill to include further religious protections, all of which were voted down. \n\"These amendments are important and I stress they are not against same-sex marriage, they are simply in favor of the rights of religious organizations to keep doing what their doing,\" Abbott said. \nOpponents of the changes argued they would legalize discrimination against the gay community. The 500 or so people in the gallery were vocal in their disapproval of the amendments. They were warned multiple times that parliamentary rules prohibit them making noise and even applauding. \nAn emotional week \nAfter the bill passed the Senate last week, House proceedings kicked off with fireworks Monday when Liberal MP Tim Wilson surprised his colleagues by proposing to his long-time partner Ryan Bolger. \nThe next day, Liberal MP Andrew Wallace, who is a devout Catholic, shared with his colleagues how his gay daughter helped change his position on same-sex marriage. \n\"She said: Dad, in the years to come, my generation will look back and judge your generation about how you deal with the issue of homosexuality in the same way that your generation considered your parents' generation in the way that they dealt with our Indigenous people,\" Wallace said. \nFighting back tears, Liberal MP Sarah Henderson told the story Wednesday night of a close gay friend of hers who died months ago and who, in one of their last conversations, asked her to continue to push for same-sex marriage. \nSurvey says yes \nThursday's vote comes three weeks after Australia voted overwhelmingly to legalize same-sex marriage as part of a national postal survey lasting two months. \nUnder political pressure to find a solution, the ruling Liberal National Coalition government announced the non-compulsory survey in August, saying if the result was \"yes\" they would allow a free vote in Parliament. \nIn the end, 61.6% of Australia voted in favor of allowing same-sex marriage, with 38.4% saying \"no.\" \nAbout 12.7 million people participated in the survey, which had a response rate of nearly 80% -- which is considered very high. \nAustralians have long been in favor of same-sex marriage, with polling from as long as 10 years ago showing a majority support for legalizing marriage equality.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name":

A1 is a truly remarkable product that gets all the basics right. The phone has a unibody aluminum design that gives it an upmarket look, with antenna lines tucked at the top and bottom. \nUnder the hood, you get a 2.0GHz Snapdragon 625, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, microSD slot, and a 3080mAh battery that charges over USB-C. One of the main highlights of the phone is dual 12MP rear cameras, with a wide-angle lens augmented by a secondary telephoto lens. \nThen there\u2019s the fact that the Mi A1 is based on the Android One platform. Running an uncluttered software makes the device an absolute delight to use on a day-to-day basis, and gives the Mi A1 a leg up in this category. \nBottom line: The Mi A1 is the best budget phone currently available in India, and that isn\u2019t likely to change for a while. \nOne more thing: Xiaomi is guaranteeing to roll out Android 8.0 Oreo to the device before the end of the year. Why the Xiaomi Mi A1 is the best \nThe Mi A1 has all the hallmarks of a Xiaomi device: great internal hardware, premium design, and outstanding value for money. Combine that with Google software and you get the best phone in the budget segment. \nThe Mi A1 gets everything right: it has a 5.5-inch Full HD panel, and is powered by the Snapdragon 625 platform. It also comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage as standard, and even has a dual camera setup at the back. \nThen there\u2019s the 3080mAh battery, which provides a day\u2019s worth of usage from a full charge without breaking a sweat. With the phone sold under the Android One initiative, you get the promise of quick updates and a clean user interface that\u2019s unmarred by any customizations. \nThe Mi A1 is the perfect budget phone. \nAll this for just \u20b914,999 makes the Mi A1 the deal of the year, and the phone to beat in this segment. Of course, with every new launch the bar kees getting high, but it\u2019s hard to see how phones in this category can get any better. \nThere isn\u2019t a single drawback with the Mi A1, with the phone holding its ground against the likes of the Moto G5S Plus and the Redmi Note 4 in every single area. \nThe phone offers the best cameras in this segment, with the quality of the primary sensor on par with the Mi 6 , a device that costs over double that of the Mi A1. \nXiaomi will be handling updates to the phone, and in the two months it has been on sale, the device has picked up two security patches. As such, the Mi A1 is guaranteed to receive updates ahead of every other phone in this segment, with Android 8.0 Oreo set to roll out before the end of the year. \nSee at Flipkart \nThe Redmi Note 4 is the best-selling phone in India this year, and it isn\u2019t hard to see why. The phone gets a lot of things right, including a massive 4100mAh battery that makes it the best device in this segment when it comes to battery life. \nYou\u2019re guaranteed two days\u2019 worth of battery life from a full charge, with screen-on-time hitting the ten-hour mark consistently. Elsewhere, the phone comes with a 5.5-inch Full HD panel, Snapdragon 625 chipset, 3GB/4GB of RAM, 32GB/64GB of storage, and a 13MP rear camera. \nBest of all, Xiaomi reduced the price of the Redmi Note 4 recently, with the 4GB variant now available for just \u20b911,999. That\u2019s a no-brainer considering the hardware on offer. \nBottom line: A year after its release, the Redmi Note 4 continues to be one of the best options in the budget category. \nOne more thing: The phone has received the MIUI 9 update, bringing a host of new features. Best for multimedia \nSee at Flipkart \nXiaomi\u2019s 6.44-inch Mi Max 2 is the ideal device for consuming multimedia. The 1080p panel is certainly the largest in this segment, but as we\u2019ve seen with the first-gen Mi Max, there is an audience for large-screen devices with huge batteries. \nThe \u20b915,999 Mi Max 2 is catered to that audience.The 5300mAh battery ensures that the device lasts at least a day and a half even with heavy usage, and you can stream movies or browse the web with the confidence that you\u2019ll get an average screen-on-time in excess of eight hours. \nThe internal hardware isn\u2019t all that shabby either, with the Mi Max 2 offering 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, 12MP camera, and a 5MP front camera. Powering it all is a Snapdragon 625 chipset. \nBottom line: If you\u2019re looking for a phone with a massive screen and huge battery, you cannot go wrong with the Mi Max 2. \nOne more thing: Mi Max 2 is great for multitasking thanks to MIUI\u2019s split-screen mode. Best after-sales service \nSee at Flipkart \nSamsung usually has no trouble selling tens of millions of underwhelming Galaxy J devices, but with the likes of Xiaomi breathing down its neck, the South Korean manufacturer raised its game considerably this year. \nFeaturing a 5.5-inch FHD display, Exynos 7870 chipset, 3GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, 13MP rear and front cameras, and a 2600mAh battery, the J7 Pro has it all. It even comes with Samsung Pay. \nThe phone is the costliest on this list at \u20b919,990, but should you face any issues with the phone, you can rely on Samsung\u2019s robust after-sales network across India. Samsung continues to lead the way for after-sales service, and if that is a major consideration for you then the J7 Pro is the device to get. \nBottom line: The Galaxy J7 Pro is one of the most feature-rich budget devices Samsung has launched in recent years. \nOne more thing: If you use your credit or debit card a lot at retail outlets, you\u2019ll love the convenience on offer with Samsung Pay. Conclusion \nIf there\u2019s one defining trend for 2017, it\u2019s Xiaomi\u2019s dominance in the budget segment. The company has launched eight devices in the country over the course of the year, each offering a differentiated feature aimed at a particular audience. \nWith the Mi A1, Xiaomi is targeting those looking for a clutter-free software experience and fast updates. If you want an all-rounder with a premium aluminum design, dual rear cameras, and clean software, look no further than the Mi A1.

A university in Australia is joining a European research project to create new types of tobacco plants for producing pharmaceuticals. A team at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane will take part in the Newcotiana project, an initiative of the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 program, receiving the equivalent of $US 8 million in funding. \nThe tobacco plant is best known for products to smoke or chew, having little to do with health. But tobacco plants can also be exploited for generating therapeutic proteins, using the plants\u2019 basic biological processes. An example is ZMapp , a drug derived from tobacco plants that was pressed into service as one of the few treatments for the Ebola virus, when outbreaks occurred in Africa in 2014. \nThe QUT team will study a native variety of tobacco in Australia, the Nicotiana benthamiana or pitjuri plant, it\u2019s original name among Australia\u2019s indigenous population, to help develop a set of advanced plant breeding tools. The university\u2019s Centre for Tropical Crops and Biocommodities already cataloged many of the plant\u2019s properties, which contributed to research worldwide on metabolic engineering, plant-microbe interactions, RNA interference, vaccine and drug production (including ZMapp), and functional genomics. \nA biological tool set for N. benthamiana is expected to produce new varieties that can more efficiently generate proteins for drug treatments and vaccines using the plants as bio-factories. Cara Mortimer , an environmental scientist at QUT, is expected to apply the work of fellow QUT researcher Peter Waterhouse , who led the sequencing of the N. benthamiana genome. \nWaterhouse\u2019s work already sequenced about 85 percent of the plant\u2019s genome, containing some 60,000 genes, about twice the number of ordinary plants. \u201cCollaboration in the Newcotiana project will allow us to have 100% of the plant\u2019s genome sequenced,\u201d says Waterhouse in a university statement, adding, \u201cIf you have the whole genome sequenced, you know what you are dealing with, and you can achieve greater precision in the applications with that information.\u201d \nThe goal of the biological tool set, notes Mortimer, is to create high-value, non-smoking tobacco varieties that act as factories producing drug molecules and proteins. \u201cTraditional tobacco is in decline around the world,\u201d says Mortimer, \u201cand this presents social problems in many rural areas where communities and farmers\u2019 livelihoods have been built around the crops.\u201d \nShe adds that \u201cThis project looks to provide tobacco plants which are efficient bio-factories and which can be farmed, providing an alternative to farming of traditional tobacco.\u201d \nMore from Science & Enterprise:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cara mortimer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter waterhouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mortimer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tobacco plants studied as drug bio-factories tobacco plants studied", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queensland university of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "queensland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newcotiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1db6ec765ea8911b9133333feef6087ef08a7445", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.u.jtZR99Y0c5V94TmOzj5LHeN3Gdkaki0qqXap5_2z6rtky80278xikJFGf1V1AuvuGBtvMJqqS.Xif6hdgXe9pEavnlcvPQQmw3KIsZN4aiERozuNQpS", "site_full": "www.philashio.com", "site": "philashio.com", "site_section": "http://www.philashio.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Android News", "title": "Google Sheets updated with new machine learning features", "title_full": "Google Sheets updated with new machine learning features", "published": "2017-12-06T19:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1db6ec765ea8911b9133333feef6087ef08a7445", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.u.jtZR99Y0c5V94TmOzj5LHeN3Gdkaki0qqXap5_2z6rtky80278xikJFGf1V1AuvuGBtvMJqqS.Xif6hdgXe9pEavnlcvPQQmw3KIsZN4aiERozuNQpS", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Admin", "published": "2017-12-06T19:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Sheets updated with new machine learning features", "text": "Google Sheets updated with new machine learning features Dec 6, 2017 \nSheets is gaining automatic suggestions to speed up your workflow. \nIf there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s been synonymous with Google this year, it\u2019s been machine learning.

Muscle-sparing techniques diminish this concern, but often sacrifice the quality of exposure. We describe a novel muscle-sparing, high thoracotomy approach for the treatment of ventral cervicothoracic and upper thoracic spine lesions.\nMethods A novel muscle-sparing, high thoracotomy approach is described, utilizing a midline posterior incision with lateral extension from the lateral decubitus position. Five patients are presented to illustrate the application of this technique in thoracic tumors with intimate spinal involvement.\nResults The muscle-sparing, high thoracotomy approach afforded gross total resection and spinal reconstruction in five consecutive patients, including stage IV lung carcinoma with invasion of the T5 and T6 vertebral bodies, two malignant fibrous histiocytomas causing thoracic cord compression, a metastatic T6 lesion of unknown primary with associated cord compression; and a Pancoast tumor. All patients seen at 6 months had full symmetric shoulder range of motion postoperatively.\nConclusions The described muscle-sparing, high thoracotomy approach provides excellent exposure of the ventral cervicothoracic and upper thoracic spine without the morbidity associated with the transection of shoulder girdle muscle bellies. This technique is particularly useful in patients with primary malignant bone tumors requiring en bloc excision and metastatic tumors with large soft tissue components.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AhEzWh", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pancoast", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:00.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50c07cd15fa7b9344716bad59b29be3f30390b42", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbU1RQqGLQ7tg4gYyi_mnitYyCNlHToiIGLkfxCjVXDeEY_zoNYdttgwmhcbJIJ2wGuNBZLwEoFi0wOObnI.qFAg9H_r1NQqwC8sfBFxBiJK9", "site_full": "www.expedia.fr", "site": "expedia.fr", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.fr/Herceghalom-Hotel.d6129491.Voyage-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Hotel Herceghalom - R\u00e9servez au meilleur prix avec Expedia.fr", "title": "Sofitel Budapest Chain Bridge", "title_full": "Sofitel Budapest Chain Bridge (Budapest, Hongrie) | Expedia.fr", "published": "2017-10-28T14:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21453, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0b46dc113b2532aaed6bdcd38f08e59cef7002b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbU1RQqGLQ7tg4gYyi_mnitYyCNlHToiIGLkfxCjVXDeEY_zoNYdttgwmhcbJIJ2wGuNBZLwEoFi0wOObnI.qFAg9H_r1NQqwC_nDFadv.OoZze.LHrzBQs7KKD00XCeC8bKFS_Yw8LRS", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-07T03:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "All very very good.

Does human society want 10-15 billion\r\nhumans living in poverty or 1-2 billion living\r\nwith abundant resources? Dealing with the\r\nimbalance of the population-resource equation\r\nbefore it reaches a crisis level is the only way\r\nto avert massive tragedy. Mass immigration is\r\njustified by confabulating that it's good for the\r\neconomy. Australians hate mass immigration,\r\ndespite all the pro-immigration, pro-diversity\r\nbrainwashing. Most people hate mass immigration,\r\nbut that's what they get.\r\n\r\nThe accumulating weight of imported ethnic scab labour and their screaming spawn will overload and collapse all our systems\r\n\r\nFar from ignoring racial differences in the search\r\nfor harmony, multiculturalism actually seeks to\r\nemphasize and preserve them. Anyone who upsets\r\nthis happy little applecart will be attacking the\r\nblack Ponzi scheme heart of the establishment. How\r\nmany of your children will be crack-whores and\r\nsuckers for globalist racketeers? Will they think\r\nplague immigration is wonderful if the real estate\r\nbed-bugs and property pimp lice are eating them\r\nalive and their jobs went to imported scab labour?\r\nThe Great Australian Dream just mysteriously\r\nbecame unaffordable, and there seems to be far too\r\nmany people. Will you please look into this? You\r\nmight exert some influence over my niggling doubts\r\nabout politicians and globalism.\r\n\r\nThe multicultural project of breaking Australians\r\n\r\nAccess to justice is routinely denied to\r\nnative-born Aussies because of Anglophobic\r\ndiscrimination and because whole communities of\r\nAussies are treated as criminals subject to\r\nvilification and defamation such as: \"bludger\" and\r\n\"racist\". The nutritional value of imported human\r\nwaste is zero. Why convert Australia into a sewer\r\nfor the third world's overflow? If you are\r\ndetermined to contract ethnic syphilis, then\r\nexport your body, please don't import filth onto\r\nthe rest of us. Monash University population\r\nexpert Dr Bob Birrell said that one would have to\r\nwander deaf, dumb and blind through Australian\r\ncapital cities to not notice how urban congestion\r\nhas already reduced the quality of life. It is not\r\na pretty picture.\r\n\r\nThe globalist hunger for Aussie blood\r\n\r\nThanks to plague immigration, Aussies can no\r\nlonger afford to buy a house, or if they can, they\r\nhave little disposable income to raise their\r\nstandard of living since they are paying\r\nridiculous amounts of their income in mortgage\r\nrepayments. The accusation of \"racism\" is a sneaky\r\nploy for disarming a victim - which is YOU! It's\r\nan ultimatum to give up and submit to bulk\r\nimmigration. You must cease resisting. Allow then\r\nto do anything. You must back down and let them\r\ninvade your country. It's a grim thought, that\r\nevery cultural disease the US and Britain gets,\r\neventually infects Australia. How can youth have\r\nrespect for adults who dump them into the violent\r\nand pointless chaos of cultural diversity and tell\r\nthem to \"celebrate\" it?\r\n\r\nThe rapidly diminishing marginal productivity of debt\r\n\r\nBeing a bloodsucker landlord, land-price\r\nspeculator or property pimp can be sweet. Picking\r\nup unearned profits from desperate tenants is\r\nalmost bliss. Plague immigration and its real\r\nestate Ponzi schemes keep the weeds well-watered.\r\nWith millions more people, you get less water,\r\nless affordable housing and generally less of\r\neverything to go around. You get more\r\nenvironmental destruction, more congestion of road\r\nand rail, more consumption of energy and\r\nresources. The globalist brotherhood of bullshit,\r\nis unwilling to understand the importance of\r\nnational or cultural solidarity. Instead, the\r\nmulticultural insanity requires mass-idiocy and\r\nself-loathing to act as major agents of cultural\r\ncorrosion.\r\n\r\nHow the fecal matter contacts the rotating thingy\r\n\r\nWe are informed that \"only multicultural education\r\nof our children can eradicate racism.\" But what\r\nkind of \"education\" is that? I think we all know -\r\nit's nothing less than Stalinist indoctrination\r\nwith homosexual bells and whistles. Just 2%\r\npopulation growth roughly doubles your\r\ninfrastructure bills, with a quarter of all GDP\r\ndevoted to replacing or creating new\r\ninfrastructure, without getting ahead, just to\r\nstop things from getting worse. Globalist\r\npropaganda brought many Australians into a state\r\nof multicultural non-existence - a condition where\r\nthey become so unhappy with being human that they\r\ngive it all up. The few of us with strong and free\r\nminds, must fight to free the zombies.\r\n\r\nCitizens appalled at being deceived about mass immigration\r\n\r\nAbove average welfare usage has been the general\r\ntrend for immigrants for decades. The main reason\r\nfor this is not failure to recognize foreign\r\ncredentials but the fact that there are no jobs\r\nfor them, unless Aussie workers are retrenched.\r\nMost wealth generated in Australia flies into the\r\ngrasp of the super-greedy. When housing is\r\nunaffordable, it is party-time for plague\r\nlandlords, property pimps, developers, bankers and\r\nvarious scum of the earth parasites who now own\r\nAustralia. Globalism isn't interested in national\r\nsovereignty - it is interested in control through\r\ndeceit. The Aussie sheeple will only be tolerated\r\nas long as they can be exploited, otherwise,\r\nextermination through attrition will become the\r\nfinal solution.\r\n\r\nDo you ever wonder why plague immigration Australia bothers to maintain a defence force?\r\n\r\nThose subhumans who haven't the capacity or\r\nresources to feed their family, usually decide out\r\nof sheer ignorance or boredom to breed like\r\nlocusts. Currently, fornicating locusts that spawn\r\nmore misery are rewarded with government\r\nsubsidies. How were Australians so stupid that\r\nthey allowed all this plague immigration and\r\ncultural diversity nonsense? A very small shift in\r\npublic opinion and legal culture could see most of\r\nour State Premiers in prison, especially if phone\r\ntaps show they have let generous property\r\ndeveloper donations affect their awful decisions.\r\n\r\nThe real issue is population growth, which by definition, is unsustainable. But the multicultural fairies don't care about that\r\n\r\nBy now it should be clear to everyone, that plague\r\nimmigration is just feeding the insane \"endless\r\ngrowth\" Moloch of capitalist greed. Our political\r\nleaders mostly become its spineless lackeys and\r\npathetic arsewipes. The failed globalist bullshit\r\nof yesterday, is recycled back into the radical\r\nnew \"reforms\" of tomorrow, and today is the\r\nglobalist tomorrow you didn't worry about\r\nyesterday. Plague immigration causing debt and\r\npoverty - this is the sick reality. Given enough\r\ntime to brainwash the masses, the globalist\r\nquislings found that they could get a majority\r\nvote to support nearly anything. After decades of\r\nglobalist propaganda, they still pretend that\r\ndemocracy actually works.\r\n\r\nFar from ignoring racial differences in the search for harmony, multiculturalism actually seeks to emphasize and preserve them\r\n\r\nAfter you cross the globalist \"level playing\r\nfield\" which is really an economic minefield, you\r\ncan wander lost in the smouldering ruin created by\r\nplague immigration and real estate Ponzi schemes.\r\nThe golden multicultural republic. It is an irony\r\nof terminal growth-mania, that governments are\r\ninducing people to compact their garbage waste so\r\nthat ever more people can also be compacted into\r\nurban feedlots just like their own garbage.\r\nMulticultural love is blind when it comes to\r\nfeeding ever more real estate Ponzi schemes with\r\nimported scab labour, or the lunatics and\r\ncriminals that third world countries happily\r\nexport. Multiculturalism is merely a facade for\r\nthis criminality.\r\n\r\nBe a daring little devil: Dilute your standard of living even further with more plague immigration\r\n\r\nNightmare vistas of Chinese-style \"Stack and Pack\"\r\nslums rapidly replace Aussie communities with\r\nthird world horror. Perhaps a death penalty will\r\nprevent corrupt politicians and greed-crazed\r\nproperty developers from destroying Australia.\r\nCuriously, the bulk immigration lobby argues that\r\nsince immigrants create a \"demand\" for goods and\r\nservices, they benefit the economy. If things were\r\nas simple as that, we could boost the economy by\r\nburning down our suburbs at regular intervals. So\r\nare we clear on what globalism offers, Aussie\r\npeasants? You WILL \"celebrate\" and \"embrace\" your\r\ncultural enrichment and ethnic diversity, won't\r\nyou? And there's plenty more multicultural shit\r\nfrom where that lot of sewage came.\r\n\r\nSoiled by a bizarre multicultural inversion of morality\r\n\r\nThe real point is that we DO NOT NEED ANY\r\nIMMIGRANTS! That's all there is to it. They are\r\nbeing forced upon us by a parasitic elite that has\r\nan agenda totally at odds with Australian\r\ninterests. You can sense the animal fear that\r\npermeates Australia's bloated, violent cities, as\r\nthe overloaded infrastructure and vital services\r\ncrack and buckle under the strain of uncontrolled\r\nplague immigration force-feeding billionaire\r\ntapeworms. When a government allows real estate\r\nsales to foreigners, it has betrayed its citizenry\r\nand must be removed. Australian governments\r\nadvanced the logical progression of betraying the\r\nAustralian people for a long time.\r\n\r\nAustralia is assailed by an orgy of asset plundering\r\n\r\nAdmiration of the imported alien ethnic, is part\r\nof the multicultural ideology of submission and\r\nsurrender, where the ethnics don't love us in\r\nreturn. There is no glory in witless local sheep\r\nstupidly inviting wolves to dinner. A cult of\r\nimmigrationism exists in the Anglosphere nations\r\nwhich falsely teaches that immigration has always\r\nbeen an integral part of their respective national\r\ncharacters. Aussies fiddled as their inept and\r\ncorrupt leaders presided over a massive transfer\r\nof public assets and national wealth to foreign\r\ncorporations and banks. Thanks to a lying,\r\nunethical mass media, this great swindle went\r\nsmoothly without protest.\r\n\r\nA punishment by globalist totalitarianism and mass immigration\r\n\r\nA false choice is put before us: Rapid population\r\ngrowth, or slow population growth. Notice how \"no\r\npopulation growth\" and \"population reduction\" are\r\nnever options. If Australia is already\r\noverpopulated, then population reduction is\r\nrequired. Unlike most policies that have profound\r\nsocial, economic and cultural consequences, mass\r\nimmigration never had public support and\r\nacceptance. The bipartisan politicians just\r\nimposed it on Australians in stealth. Everything,\r\neven a rock, has awareness to some degree, but a\r\ntypical multicultural stooge is a totally unaware\r\nrobot or zombie puppet. Their minds are ruined,\r\nand they cannot be saved. Mass extermination is\r\nthe best policy.\r\n\r\nAustralian society writes its own obituary with multicultural bullshit\r\n\r\nWhen the property Ponzi scheme crashes, the\r\ngovernment would consider massively buying housing\r\nstock to bulldoze the lot, thereby forcing-up\r\nprices. That is the kind of corrupt thinking that\r\nrages in the deranged minds of our elected\r\nquislings. In a few decades, high-rise buildings\r\nwill become useless, because the energy required\r\nto service them and to transport the subhuman\r\nresource occupants to and from their daily\r\njob-seeking tasks, will be too expensive. A life\r\nof being bloodsucked by landlords or bank\r\nmortgages, to support the plague immigration real\r\nestate Ponzi scheme, is no kind of life at all.\r\nHow did stupid Aussies fall for such a pathetic\r\ncargo-cult in the first place?\r\n\r\nPlague immigration policy clashes with reality\r\n\r\nTo all the poor gay lemmings crying over the death\r\nof multiculturalism: Suicide immediately you\r\nfaggots, or get over it. Say goodbye to the most\r\ndestructive thing ever imposed on our nation. But\r\nthe real battle for Australia is coming. Check out\r\nKelvin Thomson's call for population reform! He's\r\na Labor politician who dares to speak the truth\r\nabout plague immigration and actually cares about\r\nthe average Australian, and our environment.\r\nMulticultural societies are basically\r\nconflict-societies, and multiculturalism equates\r\nto ethnic conflict and ethnic criminality. Our\r\nmisplaced tolerance for the stranger is\r\nundermining our own ability to defend ourselves.\r\n\r\nSome multicultural dimwits think they are working for the benefit of ethnic minorities, when in fact they are stooges for globalist billionaires\r\n\r\nWith their imported scab labour invasions, our\r\nelected \"representatives\" fully intend to engineer\r\na permanent reversal in the conditions of the\r\nAustralian working class. Workers' real incomes\r\nfell even faster since the supposed \"recovery\" of\r\n2009. Do you think your faggoty, tear-jerking\r\nhumanitarian concern for scab labour imported like\r\nsewer rats from third world sewers will protect\r\nyou when the children of these creatures begin to\r\nhate you, and attack you like demented and\r\nstarving rats? We have ethnic lobbies demanding\r\nunlimited immigration for their own brethren, but\r\nstrangely enough this is never reciprocated.\r\nTrying to be a politically-correct Aussie\r\ndo-gooder doesn't work. It's a mug's game. You\r\njust end up getting buggered.\r\n\r\nA Pandora's box of multicultural mischief\r\n\r\nPolitical ideologies and globalist theologies of\r\nless than zero wisdom are passed down by an\r\ninvisible governing class to the hopeless Aussie\r\nsheeple. Those who gobble down this spurious crap,\r\nare the worst kinds of pathological coprophiliacs.\r\nI'm not sure how many ethnic parasites and cuckoos\r\nwe need to deport, but we should play it safe. If\r\nwe set the numbers high, we will lower the risk of\r\nglobalist conquest. We should reserve summary\r\nexecution for spies and traitors. People must\r\nrealize that multiculturalism is just a battering\r\nram used to smash our culture into pieces, to set\r\nus on a path to something closely resembling\r\nStalinist slavery. The Australian Labor Party is\r\nnow the Landlords Party.\r\n\r\nThe true idiots of the political Left thought that mass immigration would give a blood transfusion to their feeble Stalinist ideology\r\n\r\nThere is no substitute for the security and\r\nharmony that cultural cohesion upholds. Cultural\r\ndiversity spawns Orwellian nightmares. Australians\r\nmust not feel guilty for preferring their own\r\nnational culture. Such inclinations are healthy\r\nand normal. Our system of government needs\r\nreplacing. Ironically, population growth trends\r\nprobably will result in revolution and great\r\npolitical upheaval. Of what nature can only be\r\nguessed. Australia's population growth is\r\ndepleting national resources and degrading soils.\r\nThe third world future rushes to meet witless\r\nAustralians who trusted the globalist propaganda\r\nthat mass immigration and cultural diversity would\r\nsolve their problems.\r\n\r\nYou cannot assist \"global peace\" by massively importing ethnic strife and crime into Australia\r\n\r\nAny country that imports ethnic scab labour\r\n(enslaved populations) will soon face economic,\r\nsocial and environmental problems. The plague\r\nimmigrationists \"embrace\" the core fallacy that\r\nenergy resources will always be affordable. The\r\nCassandra Syndrome is a term applied to\r\npredictions of doom about the future that are\r\nrejected by most, but upon reflection are seen to\r\nbe correct. This denotes a fatal tendency for\r\npeople to disbelieve inescapably bad news through\r\ndenial. They want you to be calm - so don't be\r\ncalm. They want you to be tolerant - so tolerate\r\nnothing. They want to \"enrich\" you with a tsunami\r\nof colourful ethnic brothers and sisters - so tell\r\nthem where to stick their colourful ethnic flood.\r\n\r\nA disturbing part of any political speech is when one of our quislings announces: \"I am a citizen of world!\"\r\n\r\nIs Australia nothing more than a mob of ethnics\r\nwho just use the same institutions? Is Australia\r\nnothing more than a mass of overloaded and failing\r\nservices? Let's stop calling ourselves a \"nation\"\r\nand choose a politically correct name. Plague\r\nimmigration opens the door to third world squalor,\r\nviolence and poverty. Why are we allowing it? Are\r\nwe actually so insane that we \"embrace\" it? The\r\nglobalist angels of death are neither wise, nor\r\nkind, and they plan to leave you destitute. Most\r\npeople are outer-directed and on the go, racing\r\ntoward their graves and eager to fall in. They\r\nreplaced experience with reaction and intimacy\r\nwith performance. Their thinking is autistic,\r\nnarcissistic, and masochistic. In denial of it\r\nall.\r\n\r\nOverpopulation is a massive problem, and plague immigration does not help\r\n\r\nWe are not all stupid - some of us can see clearly\r\nthat ethnic scab labour is imported to feed the\r\nfilthy property parasites with easy loot. We can\r\nalso see that Aussies are to be displaced to make\r\nway for a compliant third world work force. The\r\nglobalist bread of multiculturalism is poisoned\r\nwith the Ratsak of bulk immigration. Those who eat\r\nit are doomed. There is a stinking political sewer\r\nflowing beneath the thin veneer of civilization\r\nand progress. Plague immigration made it almost\r\nimpossible for governments and industry to plan\r\neffectively, e.g. to put one's places of work\r\nclose to one's residence, and to provide services\r\nand facilities, due to the high price of land.\r\n\r\nKeeping true citizenship just out of the reach of Aussies with multiculturalism\r\n\r\nGod help us in this struggle against property\r\nparasites and multicultural lunatics putting\r\nnational survival last and the appropriation of\r\nAustralia's resources and future first. Mass\r\nimmigrationist tapeworms must be purged. Due to\r\nglobalism and plague immigration, many Australians\r\nare without livelihoods and career prospects, and\r\nthey are being dispossessed of their public assets\r\nand, indeed, their country. The crime of\r\nunaffordable housing rubs salt into the wounds.\r\nDrooling multicultural morons do not like to use\r\nthe word \"overpopulated,\" because the shock\r\nreality of it might pop their delusional bubble.\r\nDemocracy is a workable system only if the\r\ncitizens are informed, intelligent and sane.\r\n\r\nGlobalism (neo-liberalism combined with Stalinism) is predicated on the alienated and isolated non-citizen \"human resource\" rather than the community or nation\r\n\r\nResisting the corrupt imperative to just relax,\r\nand let the globalist media idiot box tell me what\r\nthe truth is, has allowed me to analyze the\r\npolitical situation in depth. I put in the hard\r\nwork that most Aussies avoided. Optimistic\r\npropaganda about the festering joys of feral\r\nimmigration might comfort the patriotic consumers\r\nfor a little while, but fake prosperity is no\r\nsubstitute for the real thing. The dark, cold,\r\neconomic winter of globalism is creeping in. A\r\nsensible country will say, \"Enough is enough; we\r\ncannot afford to import more third world scab\r\nlabour.\" In contrast, some multicultural\r\n(homosexualized) countries, will always accept\r\nalien misfits even if it means self-destruction.\r\n\r\nBehind the plague immigration chaos we find the workings of financial racketeering and real estate Ponzi schemes\r\n\r\nMost investors are not concerned about inflation\r\nbecause politicians and central bankers did an\r\nexcellent job of persuading us that inflation is\r\nunder control and isn't a threat. The global\r\nfinancial fuck-up is a direct outcome of that lazy\r\nfaith. Now that the \"Great Australian Dream\" looks\r\nlike the wobbly mirage it always was, Australians\r\nhave nowhere to go. Societies are fracturing under\r\nthe impacts of globalism and plague immigration,\r\nAmerica included. The rich never had it better.\r\nAre the growth-mad multiculturalist politicians\r\ndemon possessed? No, they are globalist\r\nbillionaire possessed. Which is just about the\r\nsame thing really, and it is truly pathological.\r\n\r\nMulticultural Treason in Government\r\n\r\nAustralia is a large country, but with limited\r\nrenewable resources. Of a total land area of 768\r\nmillion hectares, 500 mha are arid or semi-arid,\r\nand only 77 mha are suitable for agriculture.\r\nGlobalist machinations gave us plague immigration,\r\nunaffordable housing, a massive and growing\r\nhousehold debt-bubble \"wage restraint\" and the\r\nGST. Globalist reform agendas are truly toxic.\r\nEvery globalist crook has a multicultural scam up\r\nhis sleeve. Globalist multicultural propaganda is\r\nnot bio-degradable, nor is it sustainable - just\r\nlike the broken nations it plunders and swindles.\r\nThe growth-fetish cargo-cult bullshit bored deeply\r\ndown into too many greedy hearts.\r\n\r\nCultural diversity brings chaos and violence to society\r\n\r\nGlobalist parasites aren't polite enough to ask,\r\n\"Excuse me, can I enslave you Australian people\r\nand steal your national assets?\" No, they just\r\nconsult with our elected quislings, who then\r\nimplement the globalist \"reforms\" they consider\r\nnecessary. The dirty little First Home Owners'\r\nGrant tricks people into buying property, but all\r\nit really does is increase demand and drive up the\r\nprice of real estate by the amount of the grant.\r\nIt is a putrid Ponzi scheme that is ready to\r\ncollapse. Rejecting the cultural diversity\r\nmindwarp starts when you change your thoughts and\r\nbehaviour about your own nation and culture. This\r\nacceptance improves your life, and can improve\r\nthat of other Australians when they follow your\r\npositive example.\r\n\r\nWhat is this weird Canadian multiculturalism and from what ethnic sewer did it emerge?\r\n\r\nSlipping in their own drool is the main\r\noccupational hazard faced by our \"risk taking\"\r\nreal estate speculators and property pimps. Even\r\nthe Labor Party champions of the working poor, bow\r\nand scrape, at the feet of the \"winners\" they\r\nserve. There is the sound of madness and hysteria\r\nin the screechings for mass immigration emanating\r\nfrom hand-wringers of the faggy political left.\r\nLetting misfits and ratbags guide national policy\r\nis one of the weaknesses inherent in liberal\r\ndemocracy. Unaffordable house prices and rents\r\nremind us what this plague immigration revolution\r\nis actually about. The economy's fake \"buoyancy\"\r\nis based on nothing but unsustainable debt and\r\nmulticultural bullshit.

Calling Qualcomm Xiaomi\u2019s \u201cmost important partner,\u201d Jun talked about the collaboration between the two companies, which stretches back all the way to the Snapdragon S3-powered Mi 1 from 2011. \nRumors from earlier this year suggested the Mi 7 would be one of the first phones to be powered by the Snapdragon 845. We don\u2019t know a lot about Xiaomi\u2019s upcoming flagship, but it is expected to feature a 6.0-inch Samsung-made display with thin bezels, and be available with 6GB and 8GB of RAM. Xiaomi is likely to unveil the device at Mobile World Congress. \nAs for the Snapdragon 845, all we know for now is that the chipset will be manufactured by Samsung Foundry, like this year\u2019s Snapdragon 835.

The two year-old Obsidian Therapeutics in Cambridge, Massachusetts licenses research from the chemical and systems biology lab of Thomas Wandless at Stanford University, the company\u2019s scientific founder. \nObsidian Therapeutics aims to better control emerging treatments for cancer and other diseases that harness the immune system with genetically-altered cells, such as modified T-cells with chimeric antigen receptors, or CAR T-cells, to treat cancer. While CAR T-cells are shown to invoke the immune system to drive some forms of leukemia into remission for many patients, they also come with severe side effects and can be too dangerous for other individuals. \nThe Obsidian technology adapts a process developed by Wandless and colleagues known as destabilizing domains that its founders say can program the activity of CAR T-cell and similar treatments, and thus improve both their safety and efficacy. The destabilizing domains process adds a synthetic binding protein to the therapeutic protein that supports the therapy\u2019s stability, in what the company calls a synthetic biological cassette. But the stability of the biological cassette can be adjusted with a companion small molecule compound, which makes it possible to control activity of the therapy, such as its dosing. \nObsidian\u2019s first products are expected to help program cancer treatments, starting with cytokine , or short protein, cassettes for CAR T-cell therapies. These cytokine cassettes, says the company, will be designed to enhance the persistence and tumor-killing abilities of CAR T-cells, as well as improve their safety for patients. Future company products are expected to boost the safety and efficacy of gene therapies for cancer and other diseases. \n\u201cBy equipping cells with new tumor-fighting powers,\u201d says Obsidian CEO Michael Gilman in a company statement, \u201cand by putting precise and dynamic dosing control in the hands of the treating physician, we believe we can improve safety, efficacy, and durability of CAR-T therapies. Moreover, we think Obsidian\u2019s pharmacologic operating systems will enable us to build entirely new classes of living medicines.\u201d \nThe company\u2019s first funding round is raising $49.5 million led by GV , previously known as Google Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. Taking part in the financing is Atlas Venture \u2014 Obsidian\u2019s seed capital source \u2014 as well as Takeda Ventures Inc., Vertex Ventures HC, Amgen Ventures, Alexandria Venture Investments, and ShangPharma Investment Group. \nMore from Science & Enterprise:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kevin walsh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wandless", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael gilman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas wandless", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "early funds cell programming company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlas venture", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obsidian therapeutics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shangpharma investment group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vertex ventures hc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandria venture investments", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google ventures", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "takeda ventures inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amgen ventures", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:01.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "78719d6b4101db753a302e24ac7ec478e53743d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw37pM0ts6wjUDYlgl5D4Rshneb15Be3GzI.1aoqZd_NWt9lIhEWm9RHOX_W0oEykX78APhmXKpMAaEVUI53jYYNwO0T4OGhMC2PJke4pYN29nNjWYTmNaV4BqrgqVYMBW3ifIDmFvJyrSt6OnRQOkMQWC2C1quxv6j_BcSnDBnoWCLt68WeT47YrIZVwlCvyZF3_cU2JLVCmxZA8rEuWl", "site_full": "www.gumtree.ie", "site": "gumtree.ie", "site_section": "https://www.gumtree.ie/s-leinster/jobs/v1l2q0p1", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Jobs in Leinster | Gumtree Classifieds Ireland", "title": "Tool Install Electrical Designer (Dublin) Hi Tech Semiconductor Plant Project 217386586", "title_full": "Tool Install Electrical Designer (Dublin) Hi Tech Semiconductor Plant Project | Dublin | Gumtree Classifieds Ireland | 217386586", "published": "2017-12-07T12:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://securet9.classistatic.com/1.1.451/images/en_IE/logoOpenGraph.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 62533, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "78719d6b4101db753a302e24ac7ec478e53743d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw37pM0ts6wjUDYlgl5D4Rshneb15Be3GzI.1aoqZd_NWt9lIhEWm9RHOX_W0oEykX78APhmXKpMAaEVUI53jYYNwO0T4OGhMC2PJke4pYN29nNjWYTmNaV4BqrgqVYMBW3ifIDmFvJyrSt6OnRQOkMQWC2C1quxv6j_BcSnDBnoWCLt68WeT47YrIZVwlCvyZF3_cU2JLVCmxZA8rEuWl", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "gumtree.ie", "published": "2017-12-07T12:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "Tool Install Electrical Designer (Dublin) Hi Tech Semiconductor Plant Project 217386586", "text": "Candidates will have a relevant Electrical Technician or higher 3rd level Electrical qualification and AutoCAD and BIM training with a minimum of 5+ years experience working as an Electrical Designer on Tool install on Hi Tech Semiconductor projects\nSkills and Experience required:\nExperience working in an operational site and/or carrying out site investigations and construction reviews\nExperience working in a team environment and meeting a demanding delivery schedule\nBackground developing design documents using AutoCAD.

Kenya says 'swearing-in' of Odinga would be seen as treason By the associated press NAIROBI, Kenya \u0097 Dec 7, 2017, 6:12 AM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press FILE - In this Monday, Nov. 20, 2017 file photo, Kenya's Attorney General Githu Muigai, right, speaks with a petition lawyer, Benjamin Musyoki, left, after the Supreme Court judgement of the petitions over President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election in a repeat vote, at the Supreme court in Nairobi, Kenya. Kenya's attorney general warned Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017 that the opposition's move to \"inaugurate\" its leader Raila Odinga next week to protest the recent presidential election would amount to treason. (AP Photo/Sayyid Abdul Azim, File) 0 Shares Email Kenya's attorney general warned Thursday that the opposition's move to \"inaugurate\" its leader Raila Odinga next week to protest the recent presidential election would amount to treason. Attorney General Githu Muigai's comments came a day after the United States urged Odinga's supporters to call off the mock \"swearing-in\" on Dec. 12, the country's independence day. The opposition objects to President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election after months of political turmoil that included a nullified August election and a repeat vote in October, saying that electoral reforms have not been made. The attorney general warned that institutions created by Odinga's group such as \"the People's Assembly\" are unconstitutional and illegal and \"may be visited by the full force of the law.\" Odinga on Thursday rejected the U.S. advice to cancel next week's event, saying he doesn't recognize the legitimacy of Kenyatta as president. Odinga also repeated his accusations against Kenya security forces, saying dozens of people have been killed in the months of election unrest and \"nobody is talking about it. Yet they have the audacity to come and advise us to forget and move on.\" The opposition leader spoke outside a morgue in the capital, Nairobi, while accompanying families collecting bodies of alleged victims. The U.S. Embassy statement on Wednesday called Odinga's planned inauguration \"extra-constitutional.\" It came as the top U.S. official for African affairs, Donald Yamamoto, visited the East African economic hub and met with government officials and opposition leaders. Odinga's National Super Alliance has said it will proceed with the event. Odinga successfully challenged Kenyatta's August re-election but then boycotted the new vote in October, demanding electoral reforms. Kenyatta won with over 98 percent of the votes and was inaugurated last week. 0 Shares ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

Advertisement \nIn filings with the Secretary of State\u2019s office, the state Democratic Party reported raising $457,741 between early June and this week, and $597,841 since the beginning of the year. It also reported a surplus of $237,611 from the 2016 cycle, for total receipts of $835,452. \nThe Democrats spent $467,240 during the period and $711,141 so far in 2017, leaving a current surplus of $124,311 in cash on hand. \nThe NHGOP raised $102,904 since early June and $154,434 since the beginning for the year. But it reported spending more than it raised -- $119,648 since June and $184,307 since January \u2013 meaning that the party has a deficit of $29,873. \nFederal account filings are due twice annually with the Federal Election Commission.

Dana Gas said it would not repay sukuk maturing in October because changes in the interpretation of Islamic finance had made the bonds unlawful in the UAE. Issuers are now amending their documentation to preclude the use of this argument. According to Mohamed Damak, global head of Islamic finance at Standard & Poor's, clauses seeking to reduce sharia compliance risk have become normal in the global industry, but the complexity of sukuk makes it difficult to remove the risk entirely. According to Mohammed Khnifer, senior associate at the Islamic Development Bank, sukuk holders and issuers will now rely more on English law and avoid local laws with dollar-denominated issuance.
