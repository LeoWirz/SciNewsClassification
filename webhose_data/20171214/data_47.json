Onto the background I stenciled an arch window using Distress Ink, stamped what is probably my favourite Chocolate Baroque sentiment from the Words of Inspiration stamp sheet using Versafine Toffe and using the same ink stamped a selection of leaves around the edge from the  Tangled Garden  stamp sheet. The beautiful Butterfly is from the same set stamped onto Bristol cardstock and coloured with distress inks, the same colours as the background but not Oxides as I find the chalky finish can detract from the detail of the image. \n\nFor this card I used the blooms from Bold Blooms  and leaves from the same set and  Tangled Garden , stamping all onto a piece of card coloured with Distress Inks and Pearl Mica Spray, I like to add that to inky backgrounds sometimes as it helps to bleed the colours and also leaves a nice sheen. I used a piece of torn paper to create a sunray effect when I wanted to place the flower which I layered up after cutting our three different sized blooms . I cut he leaves out and arranged onto a hand drawn stem with a little bit of doodling to ass interest. The lovely Wordsworth quote is also from Bold Blooms. \n\nI had an idea to create a shadow box surrounded by Butterfly, so started out with the base made using a die set. I coloured a large sheet of card with Distress Oxides concentrating on keeping within a tonal colour palette of oranges and yellows. Onto that I stamped several Butterflies from  Tangled Garden  and cut out ready to assemble around the frame. The fairy within the aperture is from June Fairy set and grasses from Silhouette Grasses  stamped with Versafine Toffee and a masked and inked background plus a few small stamped Butterflies. Finally I layered the Butterflies around and within the layers of the shadow box. \n\nThis one to coin Charlie of Hochanda's words is \"heavy on the grunge\", I started with acrylic paints and brushed them randomly over a piece of 600gsm Fabriano cardstock, it's so sturdy that it takes water and wet mediums without warping. Next added some texture paste through a stencil to the top corner and applied some gilding polish to lift the pattern. I also added some gold gilding flakes here and there. The Lily is from the  Lily Fuchsia and Hyacinth multibuy  stamped with versamark and heat embossed with copper detail powder and then colour added using the same acrylic paint as the background, the sentiment is from  Birthday Words  and finally some lace tied across the bottom. \n\nOn the rare occasion I find myself with time on my hands I make up a batch of inky backgrounds as I find it really handy to have some in reserve when I am up against the clock to get sample made. This is one of those using acrylic paints and crackle glaze onto which I randomly stamped a sentiment from  Birthday Words  and then the focal bloom from  Breath of Spring   using Versafine Black and then colourd in with sparkle pens and stickles. The base has been stamped with several of the foliage stamps from the  Lily Fuchsia and Hyacinth multibuy . \nAs always my thanks for taking the time to visit today. \n\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to share this post on Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter, etc ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brenda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lesley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hochanda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wordsworth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie of hochanda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lily fuchsia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pearl mica spray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tangled garden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bristol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinterest", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:51.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be4bd6e56eab6afb87dcc4f226747675733c689b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqa1FEjeW2baoziLEWcOYh3X9x4kf8cP4MO3E2KEs1t8xtBkYx1s49QkWpybxUBdwiVZg33586HX0wr3kDevcCRJKI5MafqX5MANK6A99.TYw--", "site_full": "bizpr.us", "site": "bizpr.us", "site_section": "http://bizpr.co/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BizPR.us | US Free Press Release and Distribution center", "title": "Pay Your Rent Online With Lone Star Realty & Property Management Inc.", "title_full": "Pay Your Rent Online With Lone Star Realty & Property Management Inc.", "published": "2017-12-07T11:03:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be4bd6e56eab6afb87dcc4f226747675733c689b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqa1FEjeW2baoziLEWcOYh3X9x4kf8cP4MO3E2KEs1t8xtBkYx1s49QkWpybxUBdwiVZg33586HX0wr3kDevcCRJKI5MafqX5MANK6A99.TYw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CelinaJenifer", "published": "2017-12-07T11:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "Pay Your Rent Online With Lone Star Realty & Property Management Inc.", "text": "December 7, 2017 Professional Services Press Releas No comments Killeen, TX/2017: In the modern day world, most people wish to avail online facilities to save their time and effort.

For me, it's very important to be IN the center of wherever I'm staying, not out in the periphery somewhere. On my first trip to Venice many years ago (with my parents) we stayed in Mestre and I vowed never again.\nI just got back from a trip to Venice about a week ago. We considered Palazzo Stern but ended up staying at the Palazzo Sant'Angelo, which is on the Grand Canal about equidistant from Rialto and San Marco. There is a vaporetto stop within 50 yards of the front of the hotel, with no steps, and Alilaguna's orange line also has a stop there which makes it a cinch coming in from the airport with luggage.\nThe hotel itself is run by an Italian company and we thought the staff were charming. Our room, was oversized (as was the bathroom) by European standards and well appointed in Venetian style. There was a desk and chair, two additional chairs and a cocktail table, as well as a separate closet area.

Screening, Enrollment, Randomization, and Follow-up. CMV denotes cytomegalovirus. Figure 2 Time-to-Event Analyses of Clinically Significant CMV Infection and Mortality in the Primary Efficacy Population and According to Risk Subgroup. Panel A shows the incidence of clinically significant CMV infection, according to trial group in a time-to-event analysis, through week 24 after allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation among patients without detectable CMV DNA at randomization (primary efficacy population). Panel B shows the results with regard to the primary end point in the subgroup of patients who were considered to be at high risk for CMV infection, and Panel C the results in the subgroup of patients who were considered to be at low risk. High risk was defined as meeting one or more of the following criteria at the time of randomization: having a related donor with at least one mismatch at one of the specified three HLA gene loci (HLA-A, B, or DR); having an unrelated donor with at least one mismatch at one of the specified four HLA gene loci (HLA-A, B, C, and DRB1); having a haploidentical donor; the use of umbilical cord blood as the stem-cell source; the use of ex vivo T-cell\u2013depleted grafts; and having graft-versus-host disease of grade 2 or greater that led to the use of 1 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) per kilogram of body weight per day. All the patients who did not meet the definition of being at high risk were considered to be at low risk. Panel D shows all-cause mortality through week 48 after transplantation, and Panels E and F show all-cause mortality in the high-risk and low-risk subgroups, respectively.

Over the past 20 years, clinicians have adopted a preemptive strategy 11 in which CMV surveillance and detection in blood by different methods trigger antiviral treatment to prevent clinical CMV disease and minimize the toxic effects of these antiviral agents. 9,10,12 This strategy has become standard and has been successful in reducing the incidence of CMV disease, 13,14 yet CMV seropositivity and early CMV reactivation after hematopoietic-cell transplantation remain associated with increased mortality. 3,4 Thus, the development of safe and effective antiviral agents for CMV prophylaxis remains a major goal in transplantation. \nCMV replication involves the cleaving of concatemeric genomic viral DNA (i.e., CMV genome units generated in tandem) and the packaging of each genome into preformed virus capsids, a process that is mediated by the CMV\u2013terminase complex (UL51, UL56, and UL89). 15,16 Letermovir is an antiviral agent that inhibits CMV replication by binding to components of the terminase complex (UL51, UL56, or both). 17-21 In a phase 2, dose-escalation trial, 22 letermovir at a dose of 240 mg per day was highly effective in preventing CMV viremia after engraftment in transplant recipients and had little toxicity. In this phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, superiority trial, we sought to confirm the efficacy and safety of letermovir for CMV prophylaxis after transplantation in CMV-seropositive recipients. Methods Patients and Trial Design \nWe recruited patients 18 years of age or older who were undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation at 67 centers in 20 countries (Section 1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Patients were eligible if they were CMV-seropositive, had an undetectable level of CMV DNA in plasma within 5 days before randomization, and could start taking the trial regimen by day 28 after transplantation. Exclusion criteria included severe liver impairment, an estimated creatinine clearance of less than 10 ml per minute, and either current or recent receipt of antiviral agents with anti-CMV activity. Neutrophil engraftment was not required for randomization. Detailed eligibility criteria are provided in Section 3 in the Supplementary Appendix . The protocol (available at NEJM.org) was amended on June 30, 2014, to exclude patients of Asian ancestry while additional pharmacokinetic studies were completed; however, this exclusion was removed on December 10, 2014. Randomization and Masking \nEligible patients underwent randomization in a 2:1 ratio by means of an interactive Web-response system and concealed assignment, with the use of permuted blocks of six, to receive letermovir or placebo through week 14 (approximately 100 days) after transplantation. Randomization was stratified according to trial site and CMV disease risk (Section 4 in the Supplementary Appendix ). 9 High risk of CMV reactivation and CMV disease was defined as meeting one or more of the following criteria at the time of randomization: having a related donor with at least one mismatch at one of the specified three HLA gene loci (HLA-A, B, or DR); having an unrelated donor with at least one mismatch at one of the specified four HLA gene loci (HLA-A, B, C, and DRB1); having a haploidentical donor; the use of umbilical cord blood as the stem-cell source; the use of ex vivo T-cell\u2013depleted grafts; and having graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of grade 2 or greater that led to the use of 1 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) per kilogram of body weight per day. All the patients who did not meet the definition of being at high risk were considered to be at low risk. \nPatients who were assigned to the letermovir group received 480 mg per day. Patients who were receiving concomitant cyclosporine received 240 mg of letermovir (or matching placebo) per day owing to a drug\u2013drug interaction that is mediated by the organic anion transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. 23,24 \nDose selection was based on the pharmacokinetic analyses of a phase 2 trial 22 to ensure adequate letermovir exposure in all the patients assigned to receive letermovir (Section 5 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Patients received letermovir or placebo either orally (as 240-mg or 480-mg tablets or matching placebo) or intravenously (dissolved in hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, in a ratio of 1800 mg per 240 mg of letermovir, or matching placebo solution) 25 at the discretion of the site investigators. Interruptions of the trial regimen for less than 7 days were allowed. Patients, site staff, and the sponsor were unaware of the trial-group assignments. Intravenous letermovir and placebo were prepared by pharmacists who were aware of the trial-group assignments but who were not involved in the care of the patients at each site. Investigators assessed for drug interactions because letermovir is a weak-to-moderate inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A) and a weak-to-moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 enzymes (encoding cytochrome P-450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptides 9 and 19, respectively). Levels of drugs, including cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and voriconazole, were monitored according to local practice. All the patients continued herpesvirus prophylaxis with acyclovir (at a dose of \u22643200 mg per day), valacyclovir (at a dose of \u22643000 mg per day), or famciclovir (at a dose of \u22641500 mg per day), according to local practice. Procedures \nPatients were evaluated weekly through week 14, then every 2 weeks through week 24, and every other month thereafter through week 48 after transplantation. The plasma level of CMV DNA was measured at every visit in the central laboratories (lower limit of quantitation, 151 copies per milliliter [137 IU per milliliter]). Additional trial-specific assessments are described in Sections 6 and 7 and Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix . \nPatients in whom clinically significant CMV infection (defined as CMV disease 26 or CMV viremia leading to preemptive treatment) developed discontinued the trial regimen and began anti-CMV therapy according to local practice. Results of CMV testing at the central laboratory or individual sites could trigger preemptive treatment; an additional plasma sample was obtained and submitted to the central laboratory if such treatment was initiated. If CMV viremia was not confirmed, treatment could be stopped and patients could resume letermovir or placebo. The protocol suggested thresholds for the preemptive treatment of CMV viremia of more than 150 copies per milliliter for high-risk patients and more than 300 copies per milliliter for low-risk patients through week 14 after transplantation and a threshold of more than 300 copies per milliliter for all the patients thereafter. End Points \nThe primary end point was the proportion of patients with clinically significant CMV infection through week 24 after transplantation among patients without detectable CMV DNA at randomization (primary efficacy population). Patients who discontinued the trial before week 24 for any reason or who had missing data at week 24 were imputed as having a primary end-point event. Key prespecified secondary end points were the proportion of patients with clinically significant CMV infection through week 14 and the time to clinically significant CMV infection in the primary efficacy population. \nAll the patients who received any dose of letermovir or placebo (safety population) were included in the safety analyses. Data on all adverse events were collected through week 16 after transplantation. Thereafter, only serious adverse events that were considered by the investigators to be related to the trial regimen or serious adverse events that led to death were reported through week 48. Prespecified exploratory end points included cumulative all-cause mortality and the rates of engraftment, GVHD, and infection during the trial. Trial Oversight \nAfter licensing letermovir from AiCuris, the sponsor (Merck) designed the protocol with input from several authors. All the investigators and central laboratories provided trial data. The trial statisticians performed the analyses and vouch for the integrity and validity of the analyses; the authors affirm that the trial was conducted as specified in the protocol. The first author wrote the manuscript with critical input from the other authors; all the authors agreed to submit the manuscript for publication. No one who is not an author contributed to the manuscript. \nThe trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The institutional review board at each center approved the trial. All the patients provided written informed consent. Statistical Analysis \nWe estimated that the rate of clinically significant CMV infection by week 24 after transplantation would be 35% in the placebo group 22 and that the rate in the letermovir group would be 50% lower than the rate in the placebo group. Assuming a 20% rate of discontinuation for non-CMV reasons and assuming that 15% of the patients would have detectable CMV DNA at baseline, we calculated that at least 540 patients (360 patients in the letermovir group and 180 in the placebo group) would be required in order to provide the trial with more than 90% power for the primary efficacy analysis. \nThe Mantel\u2013Haenszel method, with stratification according to CMV risk group, was used to test the superiority of letermovir over placebo for the prevention of clinically significant CMV infection through week 24 after transplantation, with the use of a one-sided test with an alpha level of 0.0249. An interim analysis for futility was conducted when approximately 40% of the patients had completed the trial regimen (\u03b1=0.0001 for the power cost for the interim look at the data results for the futility analysis). Kaplan\u2013Meier plots were used for time-to-event analyses, with data censoring for discontinuation at the last assessment. We estimated differences in adverse events and their 95% confidence intervals using the method of Miettinen and Nurminen. 27 Secondary and exploratory analyses did not control for multiplicity of inferences. All the analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute). Post hoc analyses of the primary end point with the use of multiple-imputation models for missing data under missing-at-random and missing-not-at-random assumptions were performed (Section 11 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Results Trial Population \nFrom June 20, 2014, to March 7, 2016, a total of 738 patients consented to participate in the trial and were assessed for eligibility. A total of 168 patients were excluded, mainly owing to detectable CMV DNA before randomization (117 patients [69.6%]) or receipt of anti-CMV antiviral agents (16 patients [9.5%]) ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Consent, Screening, Enrollment, Randomization, and Follow-up. CMV denotes cytomegalovirus. ). Of the 570 patients who underwent randomization, 5 (3 patients in the letermovir group and 2 in the placebo group) did not receive any dose of the assigned trial regimen and discontinued trial participation. The most common reasons for discontinuation through week 24 after transplantation were death (65 patients [11.4%]) and withdrawal of consent (39 patients [6.8%]). Deviations from eligibility criteria were noted in 51 patients (8.9%) who had undergone randomization (Section 10 in the Supplementary Appendix ); all these patients continued in the trial. The CMV risk-stratification group was misclassified at randomization in 27 patients (4.7%); data from these patients were analyzed according to the confirmed CMV risk. \nThe trial groups were well balanced with regard to the characteristics at baseline ( Table 1 Table 1 Characteristics at Baseline of All the Patients Who Underwent Randomization and Received the Trial Regimen (Safety Population). , and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Overall, 175 of 565 patients (31.0%) were considered to be at high risk for CMV, including 81 patients (14.3%) with haploidentical donors and 78 (13.8%) with mismatched, unrelated donors. There were similar proportions of myeloablative and less intense conditioning regimens and of cyclosporine-based and non\u2013cyclosporine-based GVHD prophylaxis regimens. Antithymocyte globulin was used in 198 patients (35.0%). \nPatients began letermovir or placebo a median of 9 days (range, 0 to 28) after transplantation; 206 patients (36.5%) had engraftment at randomization. The median duration of the trial regimen was 82 days (range, 1 to 113) in the letermovir group, as compared with 56 days (range, 4 to 115) in the placebo group. A total of 147 patients (26.0%) received the assigned regimen intravenously (99 patients in the letermovir group and 48 in the placebo group) for a median of 12 days (range, 1 to 88). Pharmacokinetic analyses showed similar exposures among patients who received oral letermovir at a dose of 240 mg per day with concomitant cyclosporine and those who received oral letermovir at a dose of 480 mg per day without cyclosporine. Patients of Asian ancestry had letermovir exposures that were similar to those of patients who were not of Asian ancestry (Section 6 and Tables S4 and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Primary End Point \nOf the 565 patients who received the trial regimen, 70 had detectable CMV DNA at randomization, including 48 patients in the letermovir group and 22 in the placebo group; these patients were excluded from the primary efficacy population ( Figure 1 ). Among the remaining 495 patients, the percentage of patients in whom clinically significant CMV infection developed or who were imputed as having a primary end-point event by week 24 after transplantation was significantly lower among letermovir recipients (122 of 325 [37.5%]) than among placebo recipients (103 of 170 [60.6%]). The difference, with adjustment for CMV risk stratum, was \u221223.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], \u221232.5 to \u221214.6; P<0.001). The difference was driven by clinically significant CMV infection; the proportions of patients who discontinued the trial or had missing outcomes were similar in the two groups ( Table 2 Table 2 Efficacy End Points (Primary Efficacy Population). ). The between-group difference was \u221230.7 percentage points (95% CI, \u221234.8 to \u221226.6) when multiple-imputation models that considered missing-at-random assumptions to imputed missing data were used and \u221224.5 percentage points (95% CI, \u221228.4 to \u221220.7) when multiple-imputation models that considered missing-not-at-random assumptions to imputed missing data were used (Section 11 in the Supplementary Appendix ). \nCMV disease was uncommon (occurring in 1.5% of the patients in the letermovir group and 1.8% of those in the placebo group) and involved the gastrointestinal tract in all cases. Details regarding CMV DNA levels and antiviral treatments that were used in patients with clinically significant CMV infection are provided in Tables S7 through S9 in the Supplementary Appendix . Key Secondary End Points \nBy week 14 after transplantation, significantly fewer patients in the primary efficacy population had clinically significant CMV infection or were imputed as having a primary end-point event among letermovir recipients (62 of 325 patients [19.1%]) than among placebo recipients (85 of 170 [50.0%]). The difference, with adjustment for CMV risk stratum, was \u221231.3 percentage points (95% CI, \u221239.9 to \u221222.6; P<0.001) ( Table 2 ). \nThe Kaplan\u2013Meier event rate of clinically significant CMV infection among letermovir recipients was 18.9% (95% CI, 14.4 to 23.5), as compared with 44.3% (95% CI, 36.4 to 52.1%) among placebo recipients, by week 24 after transplantation (P<0.001) ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Time-to-Event Analyses of Clinically Significant CMV Infection and Mortality in the Primary Efficacy Population and According to Risk Subgroup. Panel A shows the incidence of clinically significant CMV infection, according to trial group in a time-to-event analysis, through week 24 after allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation among patients without detectable CMV DNA at randomization (primary efficacy population). Panel B shows the results with regard to the primary end point in the subgroup of patients who were considered to be at high risk for CMV infection, and Panel C the results in the subgroup of patients who were considered to be at low risk. High risk was defined as meeting one or more of the following criteria at the time of randomization: having a related donor with at least one mismatch at one of the specified three HLA gene loci (HLA-A, B, or DR); having an unrelated donor with at least one mismatch at one of the specified four HLA gene loci (HLA-A, B, C, and DRB1); having a haploidentical donor; the use of umbilical cord blood as the stem-cell source; the use of ex vivo T-cell\u2013depleted grafts; and having graft-versus-host disease of grade 2 or greater that led to the use of 1 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) per kilogram of body weight per day. All the patients who did not meet the definition of being at high risk were considered to be at low risk. Panel D shows all-cause mortality through week 48 after transplantation, and Panels E and F show all-cause mortality in the high-risk and low-risk subgroups, respectively. The insets show the same data on an enlarged y axis. All P values are two-sided. ). Beginning around week 18, the incidence of clinically significant CMV infection after prophylaxis increased among patients who had received letermovir \u2014 a finding that reflected ongoing or new periods of CMV risk, mostly as a result of GVHD and glucocorticoid use. Results were similar when the safety population was analyzed (Figs. S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Prespecified Exploratory End Points \nAll-cause mortality at week 24 after transplantation was lower among letermovir recipients than among placebo recipients in the primary efficacy population (10.2% [95% CI, 6.8 to 13.6] vs. 15.9% [95% CI, 10.2 to 21.6], P=0.03). All-cause mortality through week 48 was 20.9% (95% CI, 16.2 to 25.6) in the letermovir group and 25.5% (95% CI, 18.6 to 32.5) in the placebo group (P=0.12) ( Figure 2 ) and reflected a nonsignificantly lower nonrelapse-related mortality among letermovir recipients than among placebo recipients (Fig. S3 and Section 12 in the Supplementary Appendix ). \nThe prevention of clinically significant CMV infection by letermovir was consistent in patients at high risk for CMV disease and in those at low risk. The lower mortality among letermovir recipients than among placebo recipients was more pronounced among high-risk patients than among low-risk patients ( Figure 2 ). The treatment effect of letermovir in preventing clinically significant CMV infection was consistent across various prespecified and post hoc subgroups both at week 14 and at week 24 after transplantation (Figs. S4 and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Safety \nAmong all the patients who had undergone randomization, 267 of 376 patients (71.0%) in the letermovir group completed the trial regimen to week 14, as compared with 80 of 194 (41.2%) in the placebo group (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Clinically significant CMV infection was the most common reason for discontinuation of the trial regimen in the placebo group (82 patients [42.3%]). More patients in the letermovir group than in the placebo group had withdrawn consent by week 14 (20 patients [5.3%] vs. 4 [2.1%]); the reasons for discontinuation were similar in the two groups. \nTable 3 Table 3 Adverse Events (Safety Population). lists the most common adverse events that were noted through week 16 after transplantation. Detailed analyses of the adverse events according to system organ class are presented in Tables S10 through S12 in the Supplementary Appendix . The frequency and severity of adverse events were similar in the two groups overall. \nVomiting was reported in 18.5% of the patients who received letermovir and in 13.5% of those who received placebo; edema in 14.5% and 9.4%, respectively; dyspnea in 8.0% and 3.1%; myalgia in 5.1% and 1.6%; atrial fibrillation or flutter in 4.6% and 1.0%; and alanine aminotransferase levels of more than 5 times the upper limit of the normal range in 3.5% and 1.6%. Although the term \u201chyperkalemia\u201d was reported more frequently in patients in the letermovir group (7.2%) than in the placebo group (2.1%), potassium levels were similar in the two groups in the central laboratory measurements. Acute kidney injury was reported in 9.7% of the letermovir recipients and in 13.0% of the placebo recipients. \nFurther analysis of atrial arrhythmias did not show a relationship with letermovir exposure (Figs. S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix ). No patient discontinued letermovir owing to these events, and only two events met the criteria for being a serious adverse event. \nThe time to engraftment among patients who started letermovir or placebo before engraftment was similar in the two groups (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix ) without evidence of myelotoxicity. No appreciable between-group differences in the frequency and intensity of GVHD, other infections, or relapse of hematologic disease were noted. \nOne patient had breakthrough CMV viremia during letermovir treatment ( Table 2 ). CMV genotyping in this patient showed the UL56 V236M mutation, which is known to confer letermovir resistance. 28 Discussion \nWe found that letermovir prophylaxis to prevent clinically significant CMV infection in CMV-seropositive patients beginning a median of 9 days after hematopoietic-cell transplantation and administered through week 14 (approximately day 100 after transplantation) was highly effective, led to minimal side effects, and was associated with lower all-cause mortality than placebo through week 24 after transplantation. Patients who were considered to be at high risk for CMV disease benefited the most from letermovir prophylaxis. \nThis trial culminates more than a decade of efforts to identify new, highly effective antiviral agents that can be safely prescribed prophylactically after hematopoietic-cell transplantation. 22,29-32 During this period, we learned that preemptive therapy with the use of polymerase chain reaction\u2013based surveillance consistently reduced the incidence of CMV disease among transplant recipients, 10,14,30,33 which made CMV disease 26 by itself not a suitable clinical-trial end point. The end point of clinically significant CMV infection was accepted among regulators, sponsors, and investigators as a meaningful outcome that would capture the potential benefits of new antiviral agents to prevent clinical disease, the potential detrimental effects of subclinical CMV disease, and the adverse effects of available antiviral agents that are used for preemptive treatment. Although we did not expect letermovir to have a sustained antiviral effect after day 100, we established a prolonged follow-up and a time point at week 24 after transplantation to claim primary efficacy on the basis of previous trial designs in solid-organ transplantation 5 and to assess for postprophylaxis events and long-term safety. This trial was strict in defining CMV prophylaxis, because it excluded patients with detectable CMV viremia during screening and considered only patients without detectable CMV DNA on the day of randomization in the primary efficacy analysis. \nThe risk of CMV reactivation and CMV disease among patients undergoing transplantation is dynamic over time \u2014 its duration, intensity, and recurrence depend on multiple factors, including donor type, conditioning regimens, and GVHD prevention, occurrence, and treatment strategies. 2,10,13 Although universal prophylaxis with letermovir early after transplantation through day 100 was highly effective as an overall strategy, the notable frequency of postprophylactic 34 CMV events among high-risk patients points to the importance of personalizing the therapy 35 on the basis of risk. Extended CMV prophylaxis with letermovir may maximize the benefit in high-risk patients, including those in whom immune reconstitution may be delayed owing to T-cell\u2013depleted grafts and those being treated for GVHD. In addition to benefitting patients who are unable to take the drug orally, the intravenous formulation of letermovir is particularly important for the care of patients with severe gastrointestinal GVHD, because of the rapid CMV-replication kinetics in this context 36 that render preemptive strategies less effective. \nLetermovir use was safe overall, but we found a modestly higher incidence of vomiting and edema in the letermovir group than in the placebo group, a finding that was also seen in the phase 2 trial. 22 Similarly, the higher frequency of atrial fibrillation and flutter events with letermovir than with placebo, although rarely serious, will require further evaluation in future studies. \nThe absence of myelotoxic effects allowed the initiation of letermovir prophylaxis before engraftment. No increased nephrotoxicity was observed with letermovir despite cyclodextrin use in its intravenous formulation and the potential for increased levels of calcineurin inhibitor owing to CYP3A-mediated drug\u2013drug interactions. These characteristics, in addition to the lack of cross-resistance of letermovir with other antiviral agents, 19,37 provide an attractive profile as compared with ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir, although it is important to take into account that the activity of letermovir is limited to CMV. Letermovir prophylaxis may be of benefit in transplant recipients who cannot take other anti-CMV agents. The development of breakthrough CMV viremia with confirmed UL56 mutations that confer letermovir resistance 28,38,39 can occur; these CMV mutants remain susceptible to ganciclovir. 28,39 \nA small trial of preemptive treatment with letermovir, 40 with doses that we now know would be insufficient for sustained efficacy, 22 and an emergency-use case report of multidrug-resistant CMV disease that resolved only with letermovir 41 treatment are the only documentation of the potential role of letermovir in the treatment of active CMV infection. These medically relevant areas need further study, as does the potential use of letermovir treatment in patients with congenital CMV disease. 42 \nIn conclusion, in a diverse population of patients who had undergone hematopoietic-cell transplantation, letermovir prophylaxis was effective in preventing clinically significant CMV infection when used through day 100 after transplantation. Letermovir was associated with only mild toxic effects, which allows for the administration before hematologic engraftment, was not associated with a higher rate of myelotoxic or nephrotoxic events, and was associated with lower all-cause mortality than placebo. \nSupported by Merck. \nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. \nThis article was published on December 6, 2017, at NEJM.org. \nWe thank all the patients, health care providers, and investigators who were involved in the trial; Carolee Welebob, Sue Philpott, and the staff of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation for contributions to the conduct of the trial; and Ibirone Addy, Peter Lischka, Silvia Riffel-Friedrich, Helga R\u00fcbsamen-Schaeff, and Holger Zimmermann, from AiCuris, for discussions on the trial design and the interpretation of data. \nThis article is dedicated to the memory of Xiao Sun, one of the trial statisticians.

Run the normally open contact to your lights and then the lights to ground. Now when the relay turns on the lights turn on and are protected by a fuse. Now you need to hook one of the signal pins of the relay up to ground. Now take the other pin and run it to one side of the switch, from the other terminal on the switch run it to an inline fuse rated at 1 or 2 amps. From there you're going to be in the dash somewhere so we'll use the easiest ignition switched wire in the car, the radio ignition wire, its going to be the red and white wire on the radio.\nThis way you are only drawing about 200ma from the ignition switch and sourcing all the power for the lights directly from the battery. With a small fuse rating on the switch you reduce the chance of damaging the vehicle electrical system to almost nothing while still being able to draw 40/60A directly from the battery/alternator for any lighting demand you may have in the future. Be it just some LED bumper lights, or high power LED off-road lighting. And since the power supplied to the switch is killed with the radio, the relay will also lose power and shut off the lighting when the radio loses power. This also gives you the option of turning the key to accessory to only power up the lighting and not the vehicle computers or blower motor.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:54.070+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ef0ac070c67e8c487c054c6d39e91dfd2329a478", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJwVqYwmb5BaTAixkp2wC7Tx7hL38vUCljEDTB03OyCGb9So3JqsdSYINqLNbXJd1QVyPOVZiS4u_0IM1dX3BUxwshbSFlTjDkTVwG5hibRym.cRGZ2XJPv_KeF2Ated4OfhLqrXMDMMBURy7cnYVtfcRDf4p_m7nJ", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Appliances-Washers-Dryers-Washers-Front-Load-Washers/N-5yc1vZc3pj/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "LG Electronics 4.5 High Efficiency Steam in White, ENERGY STAR-WM3670HWA", "title_full": "LG Electronics 4.5 cu. ft.

They make awesome makeup products! If you have not tried their velvet matte Lipsticks do check them out! They also have a silicone based makeup primer which I will review soon!\nAlright so without taking any more time lets see how Colorbar Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner worked out for me.\nFirst thing First, this is how this product looks like.\n\nBrand\u2019s Claim The Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner is long-lasting and does not smudge, crack, flake or peel. With its high definition flexible felt tip applicator, one stroke is enough to define a fine or thick line. Fast drying, Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner is suitable for sensitive eyes and those who wear contact lenses too \nPackaging This eyeliner comes inside a cardboard box that has the product name and the ingredients are mentioned on the other side. It comes for INR 399 for 2.5 ml \n\n\nInside the box is the eyeliner bottle containing 2.5 ml of product. The applicator is medium-thin and precise, and applying a very thin line could be difficult with this applicator as this is a tad bit thicker. The applicator is like the same old screw cap which works perfectly fine!\n\nPigmentation and Texture Colorbar Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner is immensely pigmented , it leaves no faded finish. One stroke with enough product is enough for an opaque finish. This is completely matte finish product, has no shine what so ever! Even then this formula is not drying or heavy . While wearing this you won\u2019t get any kind of stretchy or heavy feeling on your eyelids. It\u2019s very comfortable. The consistency is not runny but a little thick . It dries very quickly which is great.\n\nStay Power I applied this one while attending a wedding and it lasted the whole time without any fading or cracking. It stays put and does not budge for good 7-8 hours . For removing this, you will have to wipe this with a makeup remover multiple times to get rid of it completely.\nSmudgeproof and Waterproof Test The brand claims that this product is waterproof and smudge, crack proof. So I checked whether its true. I tested the swatches under running water and then rubbed it with a cotton swab. See the results. \nThe liner did not fade or smudge much . Some fading can be seen on the thicker swatch, but the thinner one is perfectly fine. Overall I think this product is waterproof and smudgeproof.\nSo overall this product does stand up to its claims. Colorbar Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner is waterproof, smudge proof (unless you stand under a shower :P) This does not cracks, it dries fast . I cannot comment on its wearability with contact lenses as I don\u2019t wear any. To sum up below are the Pros and Cons of this product.\nPros Very pigmented, deep dark black Completely matte No smudging No fading Dries Super quickly Stays for a LONG time No cracking Handy applicator for precision Cons The applicator could have been a little bit thinner, although it will work fine for most of the people. The stay power is good but could be more like the Nykka liquid liner My verdict Seeing all the pros and cons I recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable matte finish eyeliner.Colorbar Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner stays strong and long.\nI will give this a 4/5 star. If it had a super fine applicator I would have given a 5, because personally speaking I sometimes like to wear thin liners, also stay power could be further worked upon.\n \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "colorbar waterproof liquid eyeliner review colorbar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorbar waterproof liquid eyeliner", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:56.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f03215fccf7129a7f3faef9db99555c6208c3782", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZToWS06x1aR10Fs0em2sHb7N9Mvb.OU..n6M_kB.wsVUJqDssPWBqnkQkvlslPi5VF2Bmyiv9lRVA--", "site_full": "ca.trustpilot.com", "site": "trustpilot.com", "site_section": "https://ca.trustpilot.com/review/d3boost.com", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "D3Boost Reviews | Read Customer Service Reviews of d3boost.com", "title": "Patz oida", "title_full": "D3Boost reviewed by Patz oida", "published": "2017-12-07T10:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.191, "main_image": "https://share.trustpilot.com/images/review?locale=en-CA&reviewId=5a290173495a4e0d5c88a18f&businessUnitId=571c11d50000ff00058bee40", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1822, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f03215fccf7129a7f3faef9db99555c6208c3782", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZToWS06x1aR10Fs0em2sHb7N9Mvb.OU..n6M_kB.wsVUJqDssPWBqnkQkvlslPi5VF2Bmyiv9lRVA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Patz oida", "published": "2017-12-07T10:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "Top Service & Support", "text": "Top Service & Support", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:56.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c509c8b73fc95760be82a7726e3e28800962dd38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju36t0jtwz7BDcIhVyQtv0KisXyQujxeMzTlsnAz1cpz0_lCsp5CD5mPlJ3vNfDJ8yR0-", "site_full": "www.ign.com", "site": "ign.com", "site_section": "http://www.ign.com/boards/forums/xbox-lobby.8271/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Xbox Lobby | IGN Boards", "title": "Nostalgia for the Duke Controller?", "title_full": "Nostalgia for the Duke Controller? | IGN Boards", "published": "2017-12-06T12:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.ign.com/boards/styles/default/ign/ign-logo-100x100.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 383, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "686dc8c5755a66443251d0973d626c82d9cc8b2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.0mPTku09GXyRjixtp3h6A.CgJ7dZju36t0jtwz7BDcIhVyQtv0KisXyQujxeMzTlsnAz1cpz0_lCsp5CD5mPlNvec7qWaiRPaeXdyyabuFQ--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "cross44", "published": "2017-12-06T12:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I loved the duke coming from dreamcast, but once you get your hands on an S going back is impossible.
