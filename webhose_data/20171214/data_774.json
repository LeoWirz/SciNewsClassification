While most states have allowed some form of lawful access to marijuana, including seven and the District of Columbia that have legalized marijuana for recreational use, federal law looms above them all.\nAs of now, the Trump administration has followed the approach of the Obama administration in taking a hands-off approach to states that chose to regulate marijuana. But with Sessions, who has publicly stated his belief that \u0093good people don\u0092t smoke marijuana,\u0094 at the helm of the DOJ, there is great uncertainty about the course of federal action.\nWhile it remains unclear what Sessions\u0092 idea of a \u0093rational policy\u0094 toward marijuana is, his remarks are understandably troubling many proponents of legalization.\n\u0093It\u0092s my view that the use of marijuana is detrimental, and we should not give encouragement in any way to it,\u0094 he said. \u0093And it represents a federal violation, which is in the law and it\u0092s subject to being enforced, and our priorities will have to be focused on all the things and challenges we face.\u0094\nAt least with respect to the claim that marijuana remains a federal violation, he is correct. And, setting aside the merits of federal enforcement of laws against marijuana, it remains within the powers of the federal government to prevent states from legalizing marijuana.\nUltimately, it is up to the Congress whether or not states and the federal government should even be in the position of having conflicting approaches to marijuana.\nFrom a states-rights perspective, it makes sense to allow states to decide for themselves how to deal with marijuana. Decades of federal prohibition have proven that passing laws against marijuana and arresting people won\u0092t eradicate marijuana from society.\nAccording to the ACLU, between 2001 and 2010, there were 8.2 million arrests for marijuana nationwide, 88 percent for simple possession. Little has changed since, with the Drug Policy Alliance reporting that 41 percent of the 1.57 million drug arrests in 2016 were for marijuana.\nDespite this, people continue to use, grow, sell and distribute marijuana, for better or worse, regardless of what the laws are. And as an October Gallup poll noted, most Americans, 64 percent, including a majority of Republicans, favor legalization.\nSeveral members of Congress have introduced legislation to put an end to the failed policy of federal marijuana prohibition, and it\u0092s time they be put to a vote.\nLeaving marijuana policy to the states, rather than the whims of Jeff Sessions or any future administration, is the only rational way forward. The Congress should end the destructive federal prohibition of marijuana and allow states to make their own choices.\n Allow states to decide marijuana legalization for themselves \u2013 Orange County Register\nContact: Contact Us: The Orange County Register\nPhoto Credit: Melina Mara\nWebsite: Orange County Register: Local News, Sports and Things to Do", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.ocregister.com/2017/12/05/allow-states-to-decide-marijuana-legalization-for-themselves/", "http://www.ocregister.com/", "http://www.ocregister.com/contact/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:50.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13c8c800f6817d9c40fab8e8253dbd26f5ab87b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq6SKsx4lXFwV2cpxf1UI5jorip1NvAhd0X6J.1p25mkc32VpB5fJNkjiLEYqXXj.8A--", "site_full": "www.thestudentroom.co.uk", "site": "thestudentroom.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/forumdisplay.php?f=912", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "[Archived] Ask the University of Melbourne - Official Q&amp;A - The Student Room", "title": "any huge fans of Edgar Allan Poe's amazing writing?!!", "title_full": "any huge fans of Edgar Allan Poe's amazing writing?!! - The Student Room", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "//static.thestudentroom.co.uk/5a252fde38287/forum/images/base/logo-facebook.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7797, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13c8c800f6817d9c40fab8e8253dbd26f5ab87b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhq6SKsx4lXFwV2cpxf1UI5jorip1NvAhd0X6J.1p25mkc32VpB5fJNkjiLEYqXXj.8A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sarah99630", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "any huge fans of Edgar Allan Poe's amazing writing?!!", "text": "any huge fans of Edgar Allan Poe's amazing writing?!!\n his poem \"alone\" is my favourite! what do you think about his writing??

The fire was understood to have been caused by a cooker. Read More Collie is first dog to be treated using fire service's new animal oxygen masks \nHowever no-one was inside, except for the two dogs, which were safely rescued just after 2pm. These two dogs were rescued from a burning mobile home in St Austell (Image: St Austell Community Fire Station) \nA spokesman from Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said: \"On receipt of this call, both appliances from St Austell were mobilised. \n\"On arrival there was found to be a fire involving a mobile home. The attending crew classified the incident as 'persons reported' and a further appliance from Fowey was mobilised.\" \nThe spokesman added: \"It was quickly established that there were no persons within the property but we rescued two dogs from the property.\" \nThis is how you can ensure your cooker remains safe and does not burn your house down: \nLast year there were 66 accidental dwelling fires due to cooking which is a reduction of more than a fifth on the previous year. Read More Fire rips through St Mabyn house as crews urge everyone to check their fire alarms \nCooking related fires account for the biggest proportion of accidental dwelling fires in Cornwall. \nCooking related fires can be very dangerous and over the past three years there have been two deaths and six serious injuries due to this type of incident. Nearly all of these fires occurred in the kitchen and the majority are related to the oven (60%) and then the grill/ toaster (15%). \nFollow these simple tips to help make your kitchen safe: The cooker Keep electrical leads from trailing over or going near the cooker Don't hang tea-towels or cloths on or over the cooker and don't put oven gloves down on the cooker after you've used them Keep the oven, hob and grill clean as a build-up of fat and bits of food can start a fire Don't leave pans on the hob when you're not around - take them off the heat if you have to leave the kitchen (even if you think it will only be for a moment, while you answer the door or phone) Read More The tumble dryers, dishwashers and fridge freezers recalled that you should return immediately after two house fires in Cornwall The microwave don't put anything that is made of metal, or has a metallic finish or parts, in the microwave don't dry clothes in the microwave Electrical items in the kitchen keep electrical leads away from water don't put a plant pot or anything wet on top of an electrical appliance check the toaster is clean and well away from curtains; empty the crumb tray regularly don't overload sockets - one plug per socket is the rule, especially if the appliance takes a lot of power (like a kettle) don't run extension cables across the floor, as they can become worn electrical appliances - especially those that work at high speeds, such as the washing machine - should be serviced each year don't leave appliances such as washing machines or dishwashers on at night check that your kettle is not leaking \u2013 this can be dangerous \nRead the Fire safety in the home leaflet for more information on the safe use of electrical appliances at home. Ventilation \nCheck regularly that the ventilation in your kitchen is working properly and is not blocked up, especially if you have a gas cooker. Protection Buy a smoke alarm fitted with a \"hush button\", so if it goes off accidentally you can silence it instantly and aren't tempted to remove the battery (except to change it for a new one). Consider having a fire blanket in your kitchen, mounted on the wall where you can get to it easily and quickly. Cook safely \nMost kitchen fires occur when people are distracted or leave things unattended, so remember: if you're called away from the cooker - by the phone or someone at the door, for example - take pans off the heat don't let yourself be distracted while cooking don't cook if you're affected by alcohol or prescription drugs turn saucepans so that their handles don't stick out (and aren't over another ring) don't put oven gloves or tea-towels down onto the hot cooker after you've used them clean your grill pan after using it. Deep-Fat Frying Deep fat fryer demonstration in Truro (Image: Truro Community Fire Station) \nDeep-fat frying presents more dangers in your kitchen. \nChip pans are safe as long as you follow some simple guidelines. Before putting food in the pan dry the food, and test the temperature of the oil by putting in a small piece of bread. If the bread crisps quickly the oil is ready. \nRemember: Never fill a chip pan (or other deep-fat fryer) more than one-third full of oil Never leave the pan unattended when the heat is switched on Never put the food in the pan if the oil begins to give off smoke. Turn off the heat and leave the oil to cool, otherwise it could catch fire Consider using a thermostatically controlled deep-fat fryer - this will ensure that the fat does not get too hot \nIf your pan does catch fire: Don't take any risks. Turn off the heat if it's safe to do so - but never lean over a pan to reach the controls. If you have a fire blanket, put it over the pan. Don't use a fire extinguisher on a pan of oil - the force of the extinguisher can spread the fire. Never throw water over it. Don't move it - it is likely to be extremely hot. If you have put the fire out, leave the pan to cool completely. \nIf you are in any doubt about whether to try and put out a chip pan fire yourself, then don't - leave the room, close the door and dial 999. If you have an electrical fire in the kitchen: If it is safe to do so, switch off the power at the fuse box - this may be enough to stop the fire immediately smother the fire with a fire blanket, or use a dry powder or carbon dioxide extinguisher \nremember: never use water on an electrical fire Like us on Facebook ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st mabyn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "st austell community fire station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "truro community fire station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cornwall fire and rescue service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st austell", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "st austell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "truro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cornwall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fowey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buckler village", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:51.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7771763fe71f9bed5172d7f4da2eb4d33d53a1fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pwDDbLyVoa7G.VD0Srb7O80PqZrd0tOoR", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/hr/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/hr/ -

$14.86/cwt when coveting to U.S. milk solid measurements.\nChairman John Wilson said in a statement on Wednesday that strong production out of Europe and continuing high levels of skim milk powder stockpiles as a result of a European Union intervention has created a downward pressure on global prices.\nThat offset strong demand for dairy in China, other parts of Asia and Latin America, Wilson added.\nLast week, the world\u2019s biggest dairy producer had flagged that its arbitration with French company Danone SA had an impact on its earnings guidance for the season but none on the farmgate milk price.\nA arbitration tribunal had ordered Fonterra to pay Danone a smaller than expected 105 million euros ($124.05 million) over a contamination scare.\nFonterra also said on Wednesday that sales volumes in the first quarter fell 20 percent to 3.9 billion liquid milk equivalent (LME), due to poor performance in its dairy ingredients business.\nRevenue rose 4 percent over last year to

Imagine that in early 2017, rumors spread that KHC eyed Mondelez for a potential acquisition\u2026 When riches don\u2019t know what to do with their time\u2026Over the past few years, MDLZ...\n\nTo continue reading, please click on the article title above...

No screen, no indicator light, nothing.\nBefore it went dead like this I had had issues with charging it, in that while I had it plugged in the laptop would flicker between its plugged in and unplugged modes (most noticeable in that the screen brightness would change), and a few times it would run on battery power even when plugged in. I assumed this was from a faulty or frayed power cord, as it is around two years old at this point, so I ordered this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016B98C8K/\nBut even with the new cord the laptop still will not turn on. My friend's laptop has an issue with the battery where the battery will not hold charge but the laptop continues to try and use it, and so it will not turn on unless the laptop is plugged in AND the battery is removed. So I tried disconnecting the battery in my laptop (could not seem to remove it - adhesive? I didn't try very hard though), to see if this was a similar case. This did not work either.\nMy questions are:\nIs it possible that this is a battery issue? I am not sure if this model of laptop can operate without a functioning battery, but if it can't, then that explains why disconnecting it and trying to run on outlet power didn't work. Is this adapter actually compatible with my laptop? I don't see the amperage listed on the Amazon page, but the brick itself has it as 1.5, while the adapter that came with the laptop is 3.2. The other measurements seem to be the same. The plug fits my laptop but it is listed as being for the Dominator Pro, mine is just the Dominator.\nI think I can find the same original adapter online, but if possible I would like to know if that's the problem before I order it and return the one I got.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B016B98C8K"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:52.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b92501b2e88be063e1e84c96a99e727d848848a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPzSujtOQEN.qhhA0eDnmiA4TQ_kDsEZrHl16xRD7RFqfjEFqbfvybSxZyRJnfHFLdDYFfSxHnleexqO0RFMYxbYzu1bdwx98RgDzHf1wOpIbjutEhQDpmpsk6kkTx0gv0Y9svj6Br6uiy_197dNJTjHceFUvgl7Xq_DKgC0YXBv8-", "site_full": "www.military-technologies.net", "site": "military-technologies.net", "site_section": "http://www.military-technologies.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["table_tennis_ping_pong", "financial_news", "finance", "sports"], "section_title": "MilTech", "title": "Tunnel Magneto Resistance Based Devices (TMRs) Market 2022: Study Growth Factors, Types and Applications with Industry Forecasts", "title_full": "Tunnel Magneto Resistance Based Devices (TMRs) Market 2022: Study Growth Factors, Types and Applications with Industry Forecasts", "published": "2017-12-07T10:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b92501b2e88be063e1e84c96a99e727d848848a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPzSujtOQEN.qhhA0eDnmiA4TQ_kDsEZrHl16xRD7RFqfjEFqbfvybSxZyRJnfHFLdDYFfSxHnleexqO0RFMYxbYzu1bdwx98RgDzHf1wOpIbjutEhQDpmpsk6kkTx0gv0Y9svj6Br6uiy_197dNJTjHceFUvgl7Xq_DKgC0YXBv8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sagar G", "published": "2017-12-07T10:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "Tunnel Magneto Resistance Based Devices (TMRs) Market 2022: Study Growth Factors, Types and Applications with Industry Forecasts", "text": "QuantumWise A/S \nGet Sample PDF of Tunnel Magneto Resistance Based Devices (TMRs) Market report at https://www.absolutereports.com/enquiry/request-sample/11215907 Major Players in Tunnel Magneto Resistance Based Devices (TMRs) market are included which give a brief analysis of following points: \n\u2022 Company Profile \u2022 Tunnel Magneto Resistance Based Devices (TMRs) Product Introduction and Market Positioning o Product Introduction o Market Positioning and Target Customers \u2022 Company Production, Value ($), Price, Gross Margin 2012-2017 \u2022 Company Market Share of Tunnel Magneto Resistance Based Devices (TMRs) Segmented by Region in 2016 \nMajor classifications are as follows: Clockwise Spin Major applications are as follows: Data Storage Industrial Motors \nFor customisation in report, Ask Our Experts https://www.absolutereports.com/enquiry/pre-order-enquiry/11215907 \nGeographically, this report is segmented into several key Regions, with production, consumption, revenue (million USD), and market share and growth rate of Storage Area Network Switch in these regions, from 2012 to 2022 (forecast), covering North America, Europe, China, Japan, Southeast Asia, India and Others By providing the above mentioned key elements on the Industry status of the Tunnel Magneto Resistance Based Devices (TMRs) Market this report is a valuable source of guidance and direction for companies and individuals interested in the industry.

I\u2019ve tried loads of different ways to make money from home so I can spend my days with my son and Matched Betting is without a doubt the best. I\u2019ve seen it mentioned so many times online before when researching money making ideas. So, I thought I\u2019d give it a go and see what all the fuss is about. Since I started a few weeks ago I\u2019ve made almost \u00a31000 in tax free cash! I really recommend giving it a go if you\u2019re looking for a new way to earn extra money from home. \nWhat Is Matched Betting? \nMatched Betting is basically a way of taking advantage of free offers and special promotions from bookmakers. Sites will offer you a bonus such as a free bet for signing up with them. In order to make money from this you will place a bet with the bookmaker, and then place a bet against the same outcome with another website called an exchange. For example, you could bet on England to win against Spain. You\u2019d then bet AGAINST England to win with the exchange, so whatever the outcome of the game, you win one of the bets. Even when you\u2019ve completed all the new customer sign up offers, you can still make money. Sites will regularly offer you free bets, special odds and bonuses to keep you betting with them. These are called reload offers and are how you can continue to make money. Is Matched Betting Legit? \nI think one of the reasons people don\u2019t try Matched Betting is because it sounds to good to be true. I was certainly wary when I first heard about it, but it is 100% legal in the UK. Before I decided to try it out, I did a LOT of research. I read tons of websites and asked other money bloggers what their experience was. Everyone I spoke to had good things to say about it so I decided to try it for myself. I think if you\u2019re considering it, do a bit of research, learn the terminology then it won\u2019t seem so confusing, and just give it a go! If it\u2019s not for you, you haven\u2019t lost anything by trying. Can You Really Make Money? \nYes, since I started a few weeks ago I\u2019ve made nearly \u00a31000. How much you can make really does depend how much time and effort you put into it. Is There Any Risk Involved? \nAs long as you pay attention to what you\u2019re doing, Matched Betting is risk free. Matched Betting is NOT gambling. You are betting on all possible outcomes of a game so whichever way it ends up you\u2019ve made a profit! You just need to be careful and pay attention to what you\u2019re doing to make sure you place your bets correctly. How Do You Get Started? \nI would really recommend using Profit Accumulator to get started. It\u2019s a brilliant website that contains everything you need to get started with Matched Betting. You can learn the basics and earn up to \u00a345 with your first two offers through their free trial. You will need around \u00a350 to get started, and once you\u2019ve completed the offers you can use your profit to keep going and earning more! Do You Need To Know A Lot About Sport Or Gambling? \nNo. If you use Profit Accumulator all the hard work is done for you. It has training videos, step by step guides, software that does all your calculations and even a help forum. \nThings You Should Know: If you have any history of gambling problems, Matched Betting is not for you \u2013 please do not enter any gambling websites Some bookmakers carry out a credit search Try and build up a pot of money from your profits that you use to complete your next offer. The more you have in your pot the quicker you can complete more offers and make more money! I would personally avoid Matched Betting in the run up to a mortgage application.

It's required for receiving payments. Create an account here . \nNote: The email address should match with the email address used to open your Coinbase wallet account because the coins are automatically transferred to your wallet through your email thereby removing the need for a Bitcoin Wallet Address. \nSteps \n\n- Download the SlideCoin app from Google Playstore.\n\n- Click on 'Register' and fill in your full name, your valid email address, and a password, and this referral code hnw446. Click register. \n\n- A confirmation mail would be sent to email, click tge link in the email to confirm your account. \n\n- Once you get the success message, go back to the app and login, you would be gifted with 300 slide coins for installing the app and earn 10% more for using the referral code I provided.\n\n- You would be asked to set Slide Coin as your default message app, click 'ok' then 'yes' once the confirmation dialog box shows. \nHow to receive payments in Slide Coin - Click Set up Payment.\n\n- Follow the instructions. \n\n- Use the email you used in opening your Coinbase wallet account. \n\n- Click 'Tweet for payment'. \n\n- Authorize the app to send tweets through your twitter account. \n\n- Send the payment tweet and voila you should see this dialog below: \n\nWait a couple minutes sometimes hours and you would get your payment. \nPayment proof \nThe Slide Coin system once in a while has some flaws so I advice you follow them on twitter,  @slidecoin , and turn on notifications so you would know if there's any problems with the payment system.

John 16:8\u201310 The Spirit Convicts You Of Righteousness When I got saved as a young man, I remember how right after praying the sinners\u2019 prayer, a counselor asked me, \u201cDo you know what you have inside you now?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cOnce you are saved, you have the Holy Spirit inside you.\u201d\nThen, he said to me, \u201cThe Holy Spirit is the ding-dong bell inside you. He\u2019s there so that when you do wrong, He\u2019ll go, \u2018Ding-dong! Ding-dong!\u2019\u201d And from then on, I felt like there was always somebody watching me, not to catch me doing right, but to catch me doing wrong. I began to see the Holy Spirit as a faultfinder!\nI\u2019m so glad that I know better today. The Holy Spirit is not a \u201cding-dong bell,\u201d and certainly not a faultfinder. He doesn\u2019t convict believers of their sins. On the contrary, He convicts believers of their  righteousness  in Christ!\nToday\u2019s verses show us that the Holy Spirit convicts the world (non-believers) of one particular sin\u2014the sin of not believing in Jesus. We believers cannot be convicted of this sin of unbelief because we already believe in Jesus. What the Holy Spirit does convict us of is our  righteousness . God gave us the Holy Spirit to remind us that we are righteous in Christ because of His sacrifice.\nBeloved, thank God that the Holy Spirit is in you to convict you of righteousness. When you fail, He is the warm, encouraging voice that points you to the cross and says, \u201cJesus\u2019 blood has removed this sin. You are still righteous.\u201d He gives you the strength to get up on your feet again and to keep walking with God. And when you know that you are righteous, you will live a life that honors God!\n\njosephprince.com theletgobook.com \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Two ways: you miseducate or you don\u2019t educate at all.\u201d This week\u2019s social problem was the educational system and the drop out rates. 32 million adults in the United States are unfortunately illiterate. There\u2019s this misconception that the adults I\u2019m talking about are the immigrants who came to America, the ones who barely know how to speak English\u2026 when in fact, that number represents the illiterate adults who are actually the native born. Yes, I\u2019m talking U.S. Citizen, born and raised. Finally, my professor concluded his lecture by telling us that \u201cthe greatest equalizer is education.\u201d I\u2019m sitting there in the front row nodding my head because I honestly couldn\u2019t agree more. I basically heard the same message preached but in different words first by my own father and now my professor. Even though my pops wasn\u2019t physically present in my life growing up, he constantly instilled the importance and value of education. He would always tell me that education was something no one could ever take away from me a.k.a. knowledge is power, people. The class ended and I started walking to my car with a heart full of gratitude because I, Clarisse Coloma, had an education. I took a lot of pride in the fact that I\u2019m beating the odds and defying the statistics because \u201cfatherless children are twice as likely to drop out of school\u201d yet here I am pursuing a higher education despite being raised in single parent home\u2013What\u2019s really good? *asked with Godfidence* So anyway, I\u2019m fast walking to my car now because at 9 pm in California it gets \u201creally cold.\u201d As I got in my car, I heard a little whisper tell me, \u201cNo, Clarisse, Jesus is the greatest equalizer.\u201d I\u2019m there like, SHOOT YOU\u2019RE RIGHT THOUGH!!!! Let me just go back and let my professor know he got it wrong\u2026. lol. I finally start driving back home and I really let what the Holy Spirit said marinate in me. \u201cJESUS is the greatest equalizer.\u201d First of all, this can be interpreted in two ways. One- God legit came down to earth (a.k.a. Jesus) to be like us humans. To walk like us, to hurt like us. He became equal with us. So when He went on that cross He felt the pain and suffering of what we deserved. All that to show us how much He loves us. Two, we live in a society where there is so much division. People are fighting for racial equality and women are for equal rights. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m so here for both of those. Martin Luther King once said \u201cI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\u201d I\u2019m here believing alongside with him because yo, in God\u2019s eyes we\u2019re all the same. Don\u2019t try to make me feel inferior for being a POC. I also don\u2019t want to be making only 80% of what my male counterpart makes if we\u2019re out here doing the same darn job\u2026but I digress, Jesus is the greatest equalizer. Back in bible days, women viewed as second class citizens and how many times did we see Jesus advocating for women? Numerous times. IN A SOCIETY WHERE WOMEN WERE BASICALLY VIEWED AS LESS Y\u2019ALL. Proof (my favorite one): Jesus and the woman taken into adultery.

(Warning: These sets aren\u2019t for the meek of wallet \u2014 and range from $100 to more than $420, though you can probably find deals.)\n\u2022 \u201cThe Vinyl Collection,\u201d Midnight Oil\nDo you really need all 11 Oil\u2019s albums remastered on 180-gram vinyl plus its two EPs? Yes. The Australian quintet is the most underrated rock band of all time. Don\u2019t argue. Go beyond the hits. Spin \u201cRed Sails in the Sunset\u201d for an anger and energy rivaling U2\u2019s \u201cWar.\u201d Try \u201cEarth and Sun and Moon\u201d for a record linking Pearl Jam and the Beatles. Discover a punk-prog hybrid that actually works in the 1978 debut album.\n\u2022 \u201cExodus: 40th Anniversary Edition,\u201d Bob Marley\nZiggy Marley revisited his dad\u2019s original session recordings and created a \u201crestatement\u201d version. The younger Marley used his father\u2019s original session recordings, including previously unused and unheard vocals and instrumentation. The new mix has the needed low-end thump of Aston \u201cFamily Man\u201d Barrett, but the bass doesn\u2019t wash out the crying guitar of Junior Marvin. This deluxe version also includes a live set recorded at London\u2019s Rainbow Theatre, a \u201cPunky Reggae Party\u201d LP featuring new mixes and a pair of 7-inch singles.\n\u2022 \u201cThe Complete Prestige 10-Inch LP Collection,\u201d Thelonious Monk\nA limited-edition box set needs to look great and sound better. This compilation of Monk\u2019s 1952 to 1954 10-inch records does that. Each album has been carefully reproduced from jacket to LP label. But it\u2019s the sound that\u2019s truly amazing. Monk\u2019s dissonant vamping on \u201cFriday the Thirteenth\u201d still feels revolutionary. And his sidemen are aces \u2014 listen to saxophone colossus Sonny Rollins practically invent the bebop/hard bop blend on \u201cI Want to Be Happy.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cThe Joshua Tree: Super Deluxe Vinyl Box Set,\u201d U2\nThe new material here includes a 1987 Madison Square Garden concert, some fresh mixes of album tracks and an 84-page book of the Edge\u2019s photographs. The MSG set feels like a \u201cRattle & Hum\u201d companion piece (check out the \u201cExit/Gloria\u201d medley). The remixes nicely update the aesthetics of the \u201980s music, especially Jacknife Lee\u2019s pulsing, electronic \u201cBullet the Blue Sky.\u201d U2 rounds out the seven-LP set with the album\u2019s B-sides, which could have been another masterpiece on their own.\n\u2022 \u201cUnearthed,\u201d Johnny Cash\nNo singer has had a late-period revival like Johnny Cash. In the \u201990s, working with producer Rick Rubin, Cash created a series of albums for American Recordings that exemplified his pain, whimsy and existential explorations. In 2003, Rubin put together \u201cUnearthed,\u201d a box set of dozens of outtakes. For the first time, the 79 tracks have been released over nine records. The \u201cUnearthed\u201d package adds a 60-page coffee table book with liner notes drawn from five days of interviews with Cash, plus Rubin\u2019s notes on each track. Of course, the music matters most: cuts go from Cash with only his lonely voice and an acoustic guitar to rave-ups with Red Hot Chili Peppers and Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, to duets with Joe Strummer, Fiona Apple and more.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jed gottlieb", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pearl jam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom petty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob marley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "junior marvin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fiona apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob marley ziggy marley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonny rollins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnny cash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacknife lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe strummer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barrett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rubin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rick rubin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "msg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red hot chili peppers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "madison square garden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:56.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f9d714157c064bbee368daae2c4d5abe12b6e2d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPG2t2xI681fqcT3unvP777bdsR7mx60oYagZkB5vuBOhFvRGdZ3ggss2378nTqS4tfQDfIEwMhX8-", "site_full": "www.military-technologies.net", "site": "military-technologies.net", "site_section": "http://www.military-technologies.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["table_tennis_ping_pong", "financial_news", "finance", "sports"], "section_title": "MilTech", "title": "Surplus for Swedish central government in November", "title_full": "Surplus for Swedish central government in November", "published": "2017-12-07T10:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f9d714157c064bbee368daae2c4d5abe12b6e2d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPG2t2xI681fqcT3unvP777bdsR7mx60oYagZkB5vuBOhFvRGdZ3ggss2378nTqS4tfQDfIEwMhX8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rony Delucia", "published": "2017-12-07T10:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "Surplus for Swedish central government in November", "text": "Source: imported from this press release . \nSwedish central government payments resulted in a surplus of SEK 17.0 billion in November.

The very beginning. Hearing an 18-year-old Elvis croon and cry through \u201cMy Happiness,\u201d recorded at Sun Studios in 1953, reveals he had the charm, coy charisma and talent way back when. From \u201cMy Happiness\u201d to a newly discovered, 1955 recording of \u201cI Forgot to Remember to Forget,\u201d this three-CD box is the most comprehensive collection of early Elvis recordings ever assembled. One revelation: Elvis began as a nervous wreck full of magnetic energy: His take on Chuck Berry\u2019s \u201cMaybellene\u201d rumbles with jitters and fire.\n\u201c Savage Young Du ,\u201d Hu sker Du . Could it be that Husker Du actually got worse as it went along? Could critical favorites such as \u201cNew Day Rising\u201d and \u201cFlip Your Wig\u201d actually represent a fall off from the band\u2019s early \u201980s demos? Nah, it\u2019s just the early stuff was awesome, too. These 69 recordings (47 released for the first time) roar with the fury of \u201980s suburbia. Honestly, the demo of \u201cDo You Remember?\u201d equals their best work. The demo also seems quaint in comparison to the trio\u2019s increasingly speed-obsessed songs. Later in the set, you\u2019ll find a handful of 30-second songs that come as brilliant bursts of anguish: \u201cPunch Drunk,\u201d \u201cBricklayer\u201d and a live version of the sonic hand grenade \u201cYou\u2019re Naive.\u201d\n\u201c Trouble No More: The Bootleg Series Vol. 13, 1979-1981 ,\u201d Bob Dylan The latest installment in the Bootleg Series could be the most controversial. Does the start of Dylan\u2019s \u201clost in the woods\u201d period merit seven CDs of 100 previously unreleased live and studio tracks? It certainly does. The maestro\u2019s move toward gospel over three albums saw him digging into deeply personal material and putting on joyful, wild concerts. Go straight to the passionate gospel of \u201cI Will Love Him\u201d (a song he only performed live twice) and an outtake of \u201cShot of Love\u201d in which organist Carl Pickhardt seems to find salvation mid-solo.\n\u201c Listen Without Prejudice/MTV Unplugged Deluxe ,\u201d George Michael Stocking-stuffer-sized but bursting with musts for Michael fans, this two-disc set combines the singer\u2019s boldest album with a dynamic acoustic concert. If you quit him after \u201cFaith,\u201d tsk tsk. \u201cPrejudice\u201d equals Michael\u2019s signature release in terms of passion, personality and bare honesty. The MTV session features heartbreaking tenderness (Bonnie Raitt\u2019s \u201cI Can\u2019t Make You Love Me\u201d) and fun, funky jams (\u201cStar People\u201d). But the treasure is the new single \u201cFantasy.\u201d A Nile Rodgers production, the dance floor groove should have been Michael\u2019s comeback track. Instead, it became his swan song.\n\u201c Diamonds ,\u201d Elton John Elton John has 33 studio albums. You don\u2019t need them all. (Don\u2019t argue, we all know nobody needs 1979\u2019s \u201cVictim of Love.\u201d) But, if you\u2019re going to start on your Sir Elton collection, start with the three-disc edition of \u201cDiamonds.\u201d Yup, this is another greatest hits package, but no other set represents his career as well. There are hits even fans forgot (\u201cBlue Eyes\u201d), true rarities (\u201cMama Can\u2019t Buy You Love\u201d from the Thom Bell sessions), late career gems (\u201cThis Train Don\u2019t Stop There Anymore\u201d). Start with these three CDs, then buy a turntable and find a $1 scratched copy of \u201cDon\u2019t Shoot Me I\u2019m Only the Piano Player.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://amzn.to/2iYJJio", "http://amzn.to/2j1qcxV", "http://amzn.to/2nCEMNB", "http://amzn.to/2j0SZTe", "http://amzn.to/2kwohBT"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jed gottlieb", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bob dylan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elvis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonnie raitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elton john elton john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "husker du", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dylan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george michael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "courtesy an elvis presley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thom bell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carl pickhardt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck berry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george michael stocking-stuffer-sized", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sun studios", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mtv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tupelo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:56.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4c0abf1047ed1c81e61cf653173be131506d16b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pwDDbLyVoa7EaZX8O1jAGUQIk4KrLlKm9", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/hr/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/hr/ - High Resolution - 4chan", "title": "Jessica Nigri", "title_full": "/hr/ - Jessica Nigri - High Resolution - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T04:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.356, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bfb41193fbab13d0451e3aae4fa9bd97df1111da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pwDDbLyVoa7EaZX8O1jAGUdeqlxlJE5gxUH2BcDCTJl0-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T09:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>3045890\n>LOL!\nWe know it's you Awang", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:56.015+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15085127, "moreResultsAvailable": 15085027, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512641636015&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 162}
