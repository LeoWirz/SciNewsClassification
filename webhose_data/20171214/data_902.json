Fish oil primarily contains two types of omega-3 fatty acids \u2014 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are well known for their heart health and skin benefits. However, fish oil also has an incredible impact on the brain, especially when it comes to mild memory loss and depression. This article reviews the research on how the omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil may affect your brain and mental health. What Are Fish Oil Omega-3s? \nOmega-3 fatty acids  are polyunsaturated fats responsible for most of the brain and mental  health benefits of fish oil . \nFish oil primarily contains two types of omega-3 fatty acids \u2014 EPA and  DHA . These two fatty acids are components of cell membranes and have potent anti-inflammatory functions within the body. They are also well known for their critical roles in human development and heart health.  In the human diet, EPA and DHA are almost exclusively found in fatty fish and fish oil. Because most people do not consume the recommended amounts of fish, many people likely fall short of getting enough EPA and DHA in their diets. The body can make EPA and DHA out of another omega-3 called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). ALA is found in some food sources, such as walnuts, flaxseeds, chia seeds, canola oil, soybeans and soybean oil. However, humans can't convert ALA to EPA and DHA very efficiently, with estimates reporting that less than 10% of the amount of ALA you consume is converted to EPA or DHA. Therefore, taking fish oil may be a good option, especially for those who don\u2019t eat much fish but are still looking to gain some of the  health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids . \n\nSUMMARY EPA and DHA are the two primary omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. Because people often fall short of their recommended fish intake, fish oil supplements may be a convenient alternative to give you the health benefits of omega-3s. \n\n\n==>>  CLICK HERE   TO GET YOUR ALL  NATURAL FISH OIL  SUPPLEMENT NOW How Do Omega-3s Affect the Brain? The omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA are critical for healthy brain function and development throughout all stages of life. EPA and DHA seem to have essential roles in the developing baby\u2019s brain. In fact, several studies have correlated pregnant women\u2019s fish intake or fish oil use with higher scores for their children on tests of intelligence and brain function in early childhood. These fatty acids are also vital for the maintenance of healthy brain function throughout life. They are abundant in the cell membranes of brain cells, preserving cell membrane health and facilitating communication between brain cells. When animals are fed diets without omega-3 fatty acids, the amount of DHA in their brains decreases, and they tend to experience deficits in learning and memory. In older adults, lower levels of DHA in the blood have been associated with smaller brain size, a sign of accelerated brain aging. Clearly, it is essential to make sure you get enough omega-3 fatty acids to avoid some of these detrimental effects on brain function and development. SUMMARY Omega-3s are vital for normal brain function and development. Low levels of omega-3s may accelerate brain aging and contribute to deficits in brain function. \nFish Oil May Benefit Mild Memory Loss The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil play essential roles in brain function and development. There are also claims that fish oil can improve brain function in people with memory problems, such as those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other cognitive impairments. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common type of dementia and impacts brain function and quality of life for millions of elderly adults. Finding a supplement that could improve brain function in this population would be a major, life-changing discovery. Unfortunately, a review of the research found no compelling evidence that omega-3 supplements like fish oil improve brain function in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. On the other hand, several studies have suggested that taking fish oil supplements may improve brain function in people with more mild types of brain conditions like mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or age-related cognitive decline. These types of conditions aren\u2019t quite as severe as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but they still result in memory loss and sometimes other types of impaired brain function. One study gave 485 older adults with age-related cognitive decline either 900 mg of DHA or a placebo every day. After 24 weeks, those taking DHA performed better on memory and learning tests. Similarly, another study investigated the effects of taking 1.8 grams of omega-3s from fish oil supplements daily for 24 weeks. The researchers found improvements in brain function in people with MCI, but no benefits for those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Based on this research, it appears that fish oil supplements may be most beneficial when people start taking them in the early stages of brain function decline. If you wait too long, fish oil may be of little benefit to the brain. SUMMARY Studies show that fish oil does not improve brain function in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. However, research suggests that people with MCI or mild declines in brain function may receive the most benefits from taking fish oil. 180 Capsules \u2013 Highly Concentrated Non-GMO Fish Oil Omega 3 Pills, Burpless, 2500mg ==>> CLICK HERE TO GET YOUR NOW Fish Oil May Improve Depression Finding treatments for depression and other mental health disorders continues to be a public health priority, and the desire for non-medicinal interventions to improve symptoms will likely increase. People have long thought that fish oil is linked to improvements in mental health, but does the research actually back up this claim? A recent review of clinical studies concluded that taking fish oil supplements improved depressive symptoms in people with depression, with effects comparable to those of antidepressant medications. However, the most significant improvements in depressive symptoms seemed to occur in people who were also taking antidepressants. Additionally, people tended to see more significant effects when the fish oil supplement contained higher doses of EPA. It is still unclear how EPA and omega-3s improve depressive symptoms. Researchers have suggested it may be related to their effects on serotonin and serotonin receptors in the brain. Others have proposed that omega-3s from fish oil could improve depressive symptoms through anti-inflammatory effects. Additional evidence suggests that fish oil may improve other mental health conditions like borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder. However, more high-quality research is needed before the medical community can make definitive recommendations. SUMMARY Fish oil supplements, especially those that contain higher amounts of EPA, may improve depressive symptoms in people with depression. They appear to have the most excellent effects on those who are already taking antidepressant medications.

Based on the best research available, you may want to consider taking fish oil if you have experienced a mild decline in brain function or been diagnosed with depression. There could be other health reasons for you to take fish oil supplements, but these two groups of people will likely see the most benefits as far as brain and mental health are concerned. There are no official recommendations regarding how much omega-3s from fish oil you need to take to see benefits in brain function and mental health. The amounts used in the research varied from study to study. The US Food and Drug Administration has set a safe upper limit for the intake of omega-3 fatty acid supplements at 3,000 mg per day. The European Food Safety Authority has set their recommendation a little higher, at no more than 5,000 mg per day. Taking 1,000\u20132,000 mg of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil daily is likely a good starting point that is well under the recommended upper limit. People with depression should choose fish oil supplements with higher amounts of EPA. It is very important to read labels carefully when  evaluating fish oil supplements . A 1,000-mg capsule of fish oil might contain less than 500 mg of actual omega-3 fatty acids, but this will vary from brand to brand. In general, fish oil supplements are considered safe at dosages under those that were mentioned previously. However, as always, you should inform your physician before starting fish oil supplements. Because of their potential effects on blood clotting, this is especially important if you are currently taking blood-thinning medications or have an upcoming surgery. SUMMARY People with depression or a mild decline in brain function could consider taking 1,000\u20132,000 mg of omega-3s from fish oil daily. Because fish oil supplements can affect blood clotting, talk to your doctor before you start taking them. \nGet smart > Start Using Omega 3 Fish Oil Supplements Today!   \n  CLICK HERE TO GET YOUR NOW ==>>  OMEGA 3 MAX The Bottom Line EPA and DHA are omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil that are vital for healthy brain function and development. People with depression or a mild decline in brain function should consider taking omega-3s from fish oil, as they may see improvements in their symptoms and brain function.

A second career online \nSoon after Divine started an Instagram account under a fake performance name, she quickly gained more than 9,000 followers. Her look and age\u2014Divine is now 43 years old\u2014allowed Divine to make a splash amongst fans who are into \u201cMILFs\u201d; basically, attractive middle-aged women who aren\u2019t shy about sharing their bodily assets. \nAlthough Divine\u2019s success has skyrocketed in the past year\u2014she now has more than 100,000 followers across her social media accounts and is leading the Best MILF category for the Adult Webcam Awards\u2014her husband\u2019s career has come to a halt. Legal advice \nBefore Divine became a popular cam model, she ran her career change by her husband, Jeff Davis, who at the time worked for the Clackamas County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Clackamas, Oregon, for over 23 years. \nTo make certain Divine\u2019s new career wouldn\u2019t affect her husband\u2019s status at work, she and Davis hired Dan Thenell, an attorney, before creating her business. \u201c[We wanted to] make sure we weren\u2019t breaking any policies or laws, and were very careful to keep my new business separate from any of my husband\u2019s activities,\u201d adds Divine. \nUnfortunately, Divine and Davis\u2019 efforts were ineffective. An end of a career \nIn October 2016, Davis was officially taken off duty and put on administrative leave, reports The Oregonian . \n\u201cInitially, when they put him on leave, he had no idea what that would mean,\u201d says Divine. \u201cI felt like that this happened to him because of a decision I made; Ultimately, it\u2019s my body and [was] my decision to make this step. It made me feel absolutely awful.\u201d \nIn April 2017, Davis was medically laid off from his position, adds The Oregonian. Divine says this move has effectively ruined Davis\u2019 \u201cillustrious career\u201d. \n\u201cHis doctors determined the actions of his employer made him sick and unable to work,\u201d adds Divine. \nSince then, the couple\u2019s lawyer has reviewed large portions of the investigation and says he\u2019s \u201cunaware of any findings of wrongdoing or policy violations,\u201d reports The Oregonian. The Police Office\u2019s stance \nThe investigation into Davis began after the Sheriff\u2019s Office \u201creceived information\u201d about Divine\u2019s involvement in pornography. The investigation \u201ccentered on whether he was involved in the business,\u201d says Thenell. \n\u201c[The] Sheriff\u2019s Office policy prohibits off-duty employment that poses a threat to the agency\u2019s ethics and code of conduct, which includes behavior that \u2018provides entertainment or services of a sexual nature,\u2019\u201d adds The Oregonian. \nIn August 2017, The Oregonian asked Sheriff Craig Roberts of the Clackamas County Sheriff\u2019s Office about the Office\u2019s investigation that lead to Davis\u2019 leave and eventual medical layoff. The publication reports that the Office \u201cdeclined to comment on the internal investigation of Davis or release its findings, citing the possibility of a lawsuit and an exemption that allows public agencies to withhold records when personnel investigations don\u2019t result in discipline.\u201d \nLyndie Hamlin, an assistant to Roberts, responded to the questions from The Oregonian with the following written statement: \u201cWe have every confidence that Mr. [Davis\u2019] separation of employment with the county was supported both by the sheriff\u2019s and county policies, and applicable laws.\u201d Online monitoring \nDivine says the Sheriff\u2019s Office started monitoring her online shows after Davis was placed on administrative leave. \nDivine used to have a website, which launched in late December 2016. She also had access to all of her members and their information . \u201cI found the name of someone\u2014the person in charge of Internal Affairs and the investigation into my husband\u2014that worked in my husband\u2019s office; I was beside myself,\u201d says Divine. \n\u201cThey used public funds to join my website and view all of my videos and picture sets, tip me on MyFreeCams, and view my private shows on MyFreeCams,\u201d she says. \u201cAdditionally, some of their chats with me were sexual in nature, like they were trying to fit in and earn my trust. It\u2019s so outrageous!\u201d \nDivine says she quickly alerted her and her husband\u2019s lawyer about what the office was doing. Thenell\u2019s initial recommendation was to let it be and see what happened. \n\u201cSo, for the next several weeks, I\u2019m trying to act like nothing is going on in my chat room. But I know that this person is there to watch me. I\u2019m not their employee\u2014they don\u2019t have any authority to tell me what to do,\u201d says Divine. \n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that on that particular cam site, you cannot have men in your room. So, it\u2019s obvious that my husband is not going to be in there with me. He is not in any of my videos, I take my own pictures. He\u2019s not involved.\u201d Feeling violated \nFinally, the couple\u2019s attorney contacted the County Attorney and told them [the Office] to cease the above listed activities. The actions immediately stopped, says Divine. \u201cThey canceled their membership to my website and quit watching me on cam as far as I knew. They were caught and they knew it.\u201d \nDivine adds that after the entire ordeal, she felt violated. \u201cI\u2019m not the person that they are investigating. I have a legal business, and I\u2019m not doing anything illegal,\u201d says Divine. \u201cI\u2019m a legal business owner.\u201d The future \nDivine says that right now, she and Davis aren\u2019t sure what their next move will be, but the potential for a lawsuit is high. \nIn the meantime, Divine says she hopes that she and her husband can start to enjoy some of her success. \u201cThis should be an exciting time for us,\u201d adds Divine. \n\u201cI should be enjoying it, and he should be enjoying it for me.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-Toronto Police Service MANDATORY CREDIT \nTORONTO \u2013 The judge at the trial of two men accused of killing a young Toronto woman five years ago and then burning her body is to begin his legal instructions to the jury today. \nDellen Millard and Mark Smich have pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in the presumed death of 23-year-old Laura Babcock. Babcock\u2019s body has not been found. \nIn its closing address on Wednesday the Crown said a \u201cmountain\u201d of circumstantial evidence points to Millard and Smich killing Babcock at Millard\u2019s home some time after 8 p.m. on July 3, 2012 and then disposing of her body at Millard\u2019s farm near Waterloo, Ont. \nThe prosecution alleges Babcock was killed after becoming the odd woman out in a love triangle with Millard and his girlfriend. \nSmich\u2019s lawyer told the jury on Wednesday that his client had no motive to kill Babcock because he was never part of a love triangle and all the Crown has is a rap song in which Smich says he killed a girl and burned her body. \nMillard, who represented himself, told the jury in his closing address Tuesday that several witnesses testified to having seen or heard from Babcock after July 4, 2012.

In the photos, an observer scolds the boy for releasing his mother but the child refused and hit his mother several times on the head while she could not move because her leg was holding her tight. Later, the observer managed to get the boy away from his mother, but the child made sure to kick his mother before she got up. \nThe mother looked at her son as if he were an alien while the observer scolded him. He then turned to the woman who scolded him and started to show him his face while warning him. The woman tried to reach out to him, but he grabbed his hand and held it. When he let go, he got into position, ready to fight, his fists clenched. In all this, her mother remained silent looking. The woman then told her to apologize to her mother, but instead of doing so, he slapped her continuously and then grabbed her neck and tried to strangle her. He beat her even more, and when the observer tried to stop him, he attacked her too, and his mother tried to defend him against the woman. People suggest that the woman is probably her nanny, which is why she is reluctant to beat him. This is a more likely story because it is hard to believe that a mother accepts that.

SQLServerCentral", "text": "\nBy Steve Jones , 2017/12/07 \nIt seems that I regularly meet people in the SQL community that are asked about moving their datastore to a NoSQL type of database. In a mature system, that might be a conversation worth having, especially if there are issues with handling the workload. I doubt there are many type of workloads that I would think are worth moving, but perhaps some exist. However, the discussion about moving is one you can have, given your understanding of the deficiencies you see in your datastore. \nOften I often find is a different story for new applications. Often I hear about developers becoming enamored with a datastore, a simpler one than SQL Server or some other RDBMS, and look to MongoDB, Cassandra, Hadoop, Neo4J, etc. as the shiny, new, exciting choice. They think NoSQL offers an easier way to build their application, where they can throw and grab JSON through an API, while changing their minds on the ways in which they need to handle data. \nThey approach a new application like a startup would, using some exciting technology that has just proven to be successful by some hot company in the news. They look forward to developing an application that other developers will be jealous of next year. Or they just want to use something new that's being written about on blogs and spoken about at conferences. Or they just want to do something more interesting on the next project. All these might be great approaches, and certainly are ways that make one's job more engaging. \nHowever. Just as this piece notes , choosing a new datastore because it's new and exciting, and not because it fits the data model is a mistake. The data model matters, often because this is the permanent output of your software application. The data will live on and needs to meet current and future needs, separate from the amazing Node.JS framework of the week that your users love. Actually, users don't love your framework. They love your work. Whether it's MVC, Angular, Django, or Dapper, most clients could care less. Any language/framework/platform can build an application that works well for clients. Your application just has to work. \nRelational databases work really, really, really well. They handle most problem domains well, with protection against common consistency errors, and they have plenty of features that help you build a solid data model. There are tips and tricks to migrate your schema to some new form if you need to. However, if you need to migrate your schema every few days, you haven't really thought about the schema. As the article notes, you need a schema. On read, on write, or both, you're not getting away with ignoring schema. \nAnd by the way, if you keep your schema in Python or C# or some other language, you're likely creating a set of \"legacy code\" that will haunt you for years and is much harder to manage than database schema migrations. Maybe it feels less risky, but it's probably way less fun to work on. \nDatabases are a pain to work with. I get that. It's so much more cumbersome than refactoring C# classes on the fly. Databases have a different job, and they do it well. If you have a good reason to choose some other datastore that's related to your problem domain and data model, then go ahead and choose something else. If you don't, then use SQL Server (or PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.). Most of you won't, so just stick with relational databases. You might not thank me, but your organization and future developers will.

It's all set up for when BTC starts its bear run. Once the bear run starts I expect most people to exchange their BTC for altcoins (primarily BCH since it always rises when BTC fails in my experience ). Actually, I should say EXPECTED since I'm not quite sure anymore because there are a lot of new people jumping on the FOMO bandwagon that probably don't have the intention to trade cryptocurrencies so it might be that all/most altcoins will go down once BTC goes bearish.\nSo my questions are:\nWhat do you think about my strategy?\nWhat is your end-of-year trading strategy? Or strategy when BTC Futures arrive?\nWhat is your BTC doomsday* strategy? (Do you think it's the same day Futures arrive?) Doomsday might be a too strong of a word. BTC might not start falling TOO drastically after all.\n submitted by /u/karacic\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:03.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1edc7e08e44a418ad44c1e58a846a17f58f81dde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgypWlmb0K2ECvNF3K6.21Ia5puxNOX13A._sgnLQx7OdBdJkWjnpb0un0T9TeU3gjM-", "site_full": "familypedia.wikia.com", "site": "wikia.com", "site_section": "http://familypedia.wikia.com/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?feed=atom", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Familypedia  - Recent changes [en]", "title": "Karrakatta Cemetery", "title_full": "Karrakatta Cemetery", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 114, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1edc7e08e44a418ad44c1e58a846a17f58f81dde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgypWlmb0K2ECvNF3K6.21Ia5puxNOX13A._sgnLQx7OdBdJkWjnpb0un0T9TeU3gjM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "1.43.82.118", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "Karrakatta Cemetery", "text": "Latest revision as of 09:49, December 7, 2017 Main Karrakatta Cemetery Main entrance to Karrakatta Cemetery [[file: Template:Location map compartment p section c |240px|Karrakatta Cemetery is located in Template:Location map compartment p section c ]] <div style=\"position: absolute; top: Expression error: Unrecognised punctuation character \"[\". %; left: Expression error: Unrecognised punctuation character \"[\". %; height: 0; width: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;\"><div style=\"position: relative; text-align: center; left: - Expression error: Unrecognised punctuation character \"[\". px; top: - Expression error: Unrecognised punctuation character \"[\". px; width: Template:Location map compartment p section cpx ; font-size: Template:Location map compartment p section cpx ; line-height: 0;\" title=\"\">[[File: Template:Location map compartment p section c | Template:Location map compartment p section cx Template:Location map compartment p section cpx |Karrakatta Cemetery|link=|alt=]] <div style=\"font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%; position: relative; top: -1.5em; width: 6em; Expression error: Unrecognised punctuation character \"[\". \"> \n</div> </div></div> <tr><th colspan=\"2\" class=\"\" style=\"text-align:center; \">Details</th></tr><tr class=\"\"><th scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left; \">Year established</th><td class=\"\" style=\"\"> 1899</td></tr><tr class=\"\"><th scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left; \">Location</th><td class=\"adr\" style=\"\"> Perth </td></tr><tr class=\"\"><th scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left; \">Country</th><td class=\"\" style=\"\"> Australia </td></tr><tr class=\"\"><th scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left; \">Owned by</th><td class=\"\" style=\"\"> Metropolitan Cemeteries Board</td></tr><tr class=\"\"><th scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left; \">Size</th><td class=\"\" style=\"\"> 98.34 ha</td></tr><tr class=\"\"><th scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left; \">Number of graves</th><td class=\"\" style=\"\"> ?</td></tr></table> Karrakatta Cemetery grounds \nKarrakatta Cemetery is a metropolitan cemetery in the suburb of Karrakatta in Perth, Western Australia .

Abuja (FCT) \nThe Nigerian Bottling Company Limited (NBC) has empowered over 700 youths at the Kano edition of its program, \u2018Youth Empowered\u2019 Workshop. \nThe workshop is part of the Coca-Cola Hellenic global initiative designed to support over 500,000 young unemployed people between the ages of 18-30 by 2020, to build life and business skills and long-lasting networks that would translate to meaningful employment and self-sufficiency. \nSpeaking at the event, Comrade Garba Mohammed, the Commissioner of Information, Youth, Sport and Culture, expressed the government\u2019s appreciation in the company\u2019s drive to help tackle the scourge of unemployment in the country. \nMohammed noted that the state government was ready to collaborate with NBC on initiatives that concern the upliftment and empowerment of youths. \nHe stated: \u201cOver the last two years, the State Government had embarked on a similar initiative to assist 70,000 youths in the state.\u201d \nWhile commending the Company for taking the bold step to assist the youths, he urged other corporate organizations to emulate the gesture from NBC by initiating other highly productive ventures for Nigerian youths, advising the participating youths to make the best use of the programme. \nThe NBC Legal, Public Affairs and Communication Director, Mrs Sade Morgan, explained that the huge turnout for the programme demonstrates the willingness and readiness of the youths to learn new skills as well as desire to tap from the depth of knowledge of mentors present at the training. \nShe stated further that the program is largely informed by the desire of the company to address a disturbing unemployment statistics in Nigeria which seems to be growing at an alarming rate, with recent reports showing that one out of every four Nigerian youth is unemployed. \nOn his part, the NBC Public Affairs Manager, Abuja and North region, Aminu Mohammed, described the program as laudable and would go a long way to boost literacy in the North. \nOne of the NBC Youth Empowered mentors, a lecturer in the Department of Mass Communication, Bayero University, Kano, Dr.Bala Mohammed, stated that the initiative by NBC is highly commendable considering the huge youth population in the North and the consequent rate of unemployment that exist in the region. \nNBC Youth Empowered has taken participants through workshops in Lagos, Port-Harcourt and Kano, to help them discover themselves, understand their strengths and developmental opportunities, as well as provide a platform for meaningful interaction with business leaders and mentors. \nParticipants were taken through a 3-day business skill workshop designed to provide them with essential business skills, such as project and time management, business planning, negotiation, financial literacy, communication and sales skills. Participants who are unable to attend the live training would be able to get the same experience online via a digital hub. In all, the NBC Youth Empowerment initiative is expected to reach a total of 10,000youths in this first instance. The practical learning from the program is life changing and can be applied by the participants on their own, at the workplace or their entrepreneurship drive", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle":
