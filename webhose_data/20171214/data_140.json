Saif al-Islam Gaddafi was released in June after being detained for six years by a militia in the town of Zintanfollowing the 2011 uprising that led to the killing of his father. \nSaif al-Islam came to prominence in Libyan politics some 15 years ago when he began talking publicly about the need for economic reforms. He highlighted some of the human rights violations being perpetrated by his father\u2019s regime, and was soon tipped as the heir in waiting. \nNow he stands accused by the International Criminal Court of orchestrating a campaign of mass murder against Libyan pro-democracy protesters as the Gaddafis fought desperately to hold on to power. \nIn recent weeks he has reportedly claimed to have led a military campaign against Islamic State militants in the coastal town of Sabratha, he told a longstanding US contact, the Guardian reported \u2013 and claimed he would fight his way to Tripoli.\u201dSaif al-Islam is inside Libya and is committed to his word, which he gave to all Libyans in 2011, when he said that he will remain in Libya to defend its territory or die a martyr for it,\u201d a spokesman for Gaddafi said in a written statement, supplied through the US contact who had extensive dealings with him before the fall of hisfamily\u2019s rule. 2019: Despite Atiku, I could still seek PDP presidential ticket \u2013 Makarfi \n\u201cThe forces who fought in Sabratha against IS, the gangs of illegal immigrants and the oil-smuggling mafias were mainly members of the tribes who support Saif al-Islam, and those who were part of the former Libyan army, also loyal to Saif Gaddafi.\u201d \nObservers say Gaddafi could still emerge as a political force if elections are held next year and he is allowed to stand despite his ICC indictment for alleged crimes against humanity. \nHe was also sentenced to death by a court in Tripoli in 2015, though that trial was conducted in absentia and was widely criticised by human rights groups. \nA diplomat involved in election preparations said the ICC indictment would not necessarily stop him from standing, or winning. Obasanjo is boss of bosses, says Jonathan \n\u201cWe don\u2019t control who stands in the election. That is up to the Libyans,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cYou can see he has popularity on the ground, particularly in the south.\u201d \nIf or when a vote does go ahead, Libya observers said Saif Gaddafi could benefit from the frustration of political divisions and a longing for the relative stability of the Gaddafi era. \nAfter a 2015 UN-backed agreement, a unity Government of National Accord (GNA) with Fayez al-Sarraj as prime minister took office in Tripoli last year. \nBut it has struggled to impose its authority elsewhere, particularly in the east, where military strongman General Khalifa Haftar controls much of the territory and supports a rival parliament, backed by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Russia. Obaze rejects Obiano\u2019s victory in Anambra governorship poll \nIn September, the United Nations launched a new plan to bring stability to Libya, which has been in chaos since the 2011 NATO-backed popular revolt against Gaddafi.

Not before putting up a huge, behind closed doors fight, with her Fine Gael colleagues. There was even talk about her \u201cHaving something on Leo?\u201d Nonetheless, he remained so steadfastly on the side of \u201cShe has done nothing wrong and let\u2019s wait for the tribunal, before judging her!\u201d\n\nThe trouble was, that Leo\u2019s pantomime Dames were also told, in no uncertain terms, to get behind their T\u00e1naiste. \u201cThey\u2019re behind you!\u201d The spin was \u201cInnocent until proved guilty.\u201d Then more and more, leaked emails started to appear. Evidence against the Minister was mounting, indications being that Frances knew more about the shenanigans surrounding Maurice McCabe, than she was willing to tell the D\u00e1il. Had she convinced Leo, she was no Panto Baddie, no Wicked Witch? \nPressure mounted on ALL concerned, nobody wanted a pre-Christmas election. The hustings were awash with threats of rebellion. There was no festive cheer. The door knocking over the 12 Days of Christmas, was without doubt, going to be a complete and utter disaster. It would be an election date of infamy. \nJoy of joys. Two Tuesdays ago Frances did the honourable thing and tendered her resignation, at the very, very, very last minute. Talk about leaving it late. She took the Government and the country right to the wire. \nThere must have been terms and conditions attached? \nSure enough, only a few hours later, the now ex-Minister and ex-T\u00e1naiste received the full backing of her party. She stood for and was nominated, as the FG candidate for the next general election in her Dublin Mid West constituency. I have no doubt that a future ministerial role has been pencilled in, if FG are returned to govern. \nScroll forward a few days and on Thursday 30 th November, Scotland\u2019s St.Andrew\u2019s Day, Minister Simon Coveney, can\u2019t believe his luck. Accepting the position of T\u00e1naiste with alacrity. Have absolutely no doubt, he has attached his very own \u201cTs and Cs\u201d to keep FG and FF happy. Will we see a third budget, as promised in the Confidence and Supply Agreement? \u201cOh yes we will!\u201d Well, only time will tell.   Then out of the blue, the terms of reference are announced, by Minister Simon Harris, for the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services. We\u2019d rub our magic lamp and Waterford\u2019s Lotto numbers would come up. We\u2019d scoop the Euro Millions jackpot. Professor Nolan would lead the review that would once and for all, deliver the South East\u2019s cardiac services. \nAlas, yet another false dawn, I am afraid. \nThe terms of reference, are once again, comical, laughable, and even \u201cWishy-Washy\u201d. They are quite evidently worthy lines for a pantomime Dame. \u201cOh NO they\u2019re NOT!\u201d the Government shout. \u201cOh YES they are!\u201d we shout back. \nAn unbelievably long, drawn-out timescale of 12 to 18 months. Hello, we might all be dead, by the time the report comes back to Minister Harris! At least the can has been well and truly kicked down the road, for the next Government to fight Waterford. \nThen, we see the now obligatory photo shoot, appearing all over social media. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong. I am sure that some, maybe even all, are trying very hard to deliver our very basic health service rights. But when you see only three TDs pictured with the Minister, is it any wonder that this South East \u201cCrisis\u201d, is seen by those in the D\u00e1il as wholly Waterford\u2019s conundrum? \nCould I produce a few more TDs from behind the Minister? \u201cAbracadabra\u201d, I shouted, but without my magic lamp to rub, no more appeared. \nThere are 158 TDs in the D\u00e1il, yet only 3 turned up for the launch picture. That represents less than 2% of the total number seated in Dublin. If all 19 regional representatives had shown up, that would have increased the proportion to 12%!!!! \nOr to put it another way. I win \u20ac1,000,000 on the Lotto and offer a lucky reader the chance to get 2% or 12% of these winnings. \u20ac20,000 or \u20ac120,000 \u2013 what would you choose???? \nPercentages matter in Irish politics.

Lange & S\u00f6hne founder Ferdinand Adolphe Lange and the man credited with bringing high watchmaking back to Germany \u2014 passed away on January 17, the second day of SIHH 2017. Fittingly, at the upcoming SIHH 2018, the watch brand that Walter Lange resurrected in the wake of German reunification will pay tribute to him in a way he would likely have appreciated \u2014 with the 1815 \u201cHomage to Walter Lange\u201d timepiece, which features a modern version of a 150-year-old horological invention conceived by his great-grandfather. The limited-edition watch (above, in yellow gold) commemorates Walter Lange (below, in 1997), who rebuilt his great-grandfather\u2019s A. Lange & S\u00f6hne brand in Glash\u00fctte, Germany, in 1990 and passed away in 2017. \nThe featured complication in the \u201cHomage\u201d timepieces is a stoppable, jumping sweep-seconds hand, an innovation that Ferdinand Adolphe Lange developed in 1876. Further advanced by F.A. Lange\u2019s older son, Richard, it received one of Germany\u2019s very first patents one year later, in 1877. The mechanism, which is referred to in the patent as a \u201cone-second movement with a jumping hand,\u201d was first implemented in a pocketwatch by Ferdinand\u2019s second son (and Walter\u2019s grandfather), Emil, shortly thereafter. Those watches, of which more than 300 were made, featured a subsidiary subdial for the jumping sweep seconds, a design also used in the contemporary wristwatches. \nWhat makes this function so special, and so rare in mechanical watches? Simply put, depending on a movement\u2019s balance frequency, the seconds hand takes five to ten tiny steps to advance from second to second, thus appearing to the naked eye that it is making a continuous sweep around the dial. In a jumping seconds movement, however, the second increments are divided into coherent units of time, with the hand making just one discernible jump each second, thus allowing for more precise measurements of short periods when the hand is stopped. The 1815 Homage to Walter Lange is available in yellow gold (top photo), white gold (above), and rose gold (below). \nThe \u201cHomage to Walter Lange\u201d watch, in fact, offers both types of seconds displays. The blued small seconds hand in the 6 o\u2019clock subdial takes six steps to go from second to second for a smooth, traditional display, while the central sweep seconds hand performs precise one-second jumps and can be stopped by the press of a pusher at 7 o\u2019clock in order to read elapsed times under one minute on its outer railway-track scale \u2014 somewhat in the manner of a chronograph, only more subtle and elegant. \nThe newly developed, in-house movement that provides this functionality has been dubbed Caliber L1924, with the numeric designation referencing Walter Lange\u2019s birth year. Like the historical pocketwatch movements that inspired it, it controls its seconds jumps with a \u201cflirt-and-start\u201d mechanism that operates thusly: after each full second, one of six tips on a star-shaped wheel frees the tensioned lever arm \u2014 watchmakers refer to it as the \u201cflirt\u201d \u2014 which then swiftly rotates by 360 degrees before being halted again by the next tip. This motion sequence causes the seconds hand to advance one marker at a time. Meanwhile, the ratchet wheel located above the three-quarter plate has a dual function, storing the power needed for the seconds jump, and at the same time stopping the sweep seconds hand. In addition to the gold-cased models, Lange offers a unique piece in a steel case with a black enameled dial. \nTicking inside the 40.5-mm case, and under the solid silver argent\u00e9 dial, the manually winding Caliber L1924 features the traditional elements and decorative flourishes associated with Saxon watchmaking, including plates and bridges made of untreated German silver, a hand-engraved balance cock, screwed gold chatons, and Glash\u00fctte wave finishing. Made up of 253 components, including 36 jewels and Lange\u2019s own in-house-manufactured hairspring, the movement offers a power reserve of 60 hours and is visible through a clear caseback. \nThe A. Lange & S\u00f6hne 1815 \u201cHomage to Walter Lange\u201d is available in three gold-cased versions, each with hand-stitched alligator straps with case-matching gold buckles, and each in limited edition numbers that reference milestones in the life of Walter Lange and in the history of A. Lange & S\u00f6hne. The yellow-gold watch is limited to 27 pieces, referencing the 27 years between the 1990 relaunch of the brand and the unveiling of this tribute watch. The rose-gold watch is limited to 90 pieces, another reference to the seminal year of 1990. The white-gold watch is limited to 145 pieces, for the 145 years that elapsed between 1845, when F.A. Lange founded the brand, and 1990, when his great-grandson resurrected it. In addition, Lange is offering a single piece in a stainless-steel case and a black enameled-finish silver dial, which will not be priced for retail sale but auctioned for a charitable cause, according to the company, sometime in 2018.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "walter lange", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "a. lange", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ferdinand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saxon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glash\u00fctte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ferdinand adolphe lange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "f.a. lange", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "a. lange & s\u00f6hne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "f.a. lange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "glash\u00fctte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:47.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e69f609c3b5eef7d5108c34be10756503be4fef1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTKkyL_kU.JS2rpkZibe5SZ2q3X3.tUTjXz.i9bCX.hxIcmGTCmwZ9b9tm4aX020EPQNtR_W0a1sDVdQG8Cx8URhmI8_jkYEJgfHzf1ZGMepIswgnHU5XnEqAg37sERUruQzT_hNQTKAg--", "site_full": "aawsat.com", "site": "aawsat.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Erdogan Makes Historic Visit to Greece to Improve Relations | Asharq AL-awsat", "title_full": "Erdogan Makes Historic Visit to Greece to Improve Relations | Asharq AL-awsat", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.168, "main_image": "https://aawsat.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2017/12/07/erdogan.jpg?itok=pom6Zdro", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5493, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e69f609c3b5eef7d5108c34be10756503be4fef1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTKkyL_kU.JS2rpkZibe5SZ2q3X3.tUTjXz.i9bCX.hxIcmGTCmwZ9b9tm4aX020EPQNtR_W0a1sDVdQG8Cx8URhmI8_jkYEJgfHzf1ZGMepIswgnHU5XnEqAg37sERUruQzT_hNQTKAg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Erdogan Makes Historic Visit to Greece to Improve Relations | Asharq AL-awsat", "text": "Erdogan Makes Historic Visit to Greece to Improve Relations Erdogan Makes Historic Visit to Greece to Improve Relations Erdogan Makes Historic Visit to Greece to Improve Relations Thursday, 7 December, 2017 - 09:00 A A Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrives to hold a news conference at Ataturk International Airport in Istanbul, Turkey September 8, 2017. REUTERS/Osman Orsal/File Photo Istanbul - Athens - Asharq Al-Awsat and Abdel Sattar Barakat Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will start on Thursday a two-day official visit to Greece aimed at improving ties between the two neighbors in a move closely monitored by EU leaders, who are counting on Ankara's cooperation on immigration. During the visit, the first of a Turkish president since 1952, Erdogan will meet with President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and then will visit the Muslim minority in Thrace, in the north of the country, AFP reported. Dimitris Tzanakopoulos, spokesman for the Greek government, said his country hoped the visit of the Turkish president to Athens would be fruitful in improving bilateral relations. \u201cIssues of mutual interest will be on the agenda of the talks; they include tensions in the Aegean Sea, the refugee crisis and economic relations, with an emphasis on energy, trade and transport. All we expect is a real development of our relationship with Turkey, because this can play a catalytic role for development and we expect very constructive talks,\u201d he stated. The European Union hopes that Turkey would cooperate in preventing the passage of migrants and refugees to the Aegean islands near Turkey. Athens and Istanbul are major players in the migration files and in the talks on Cyprus, where Turkey occupies the northern territories. Erdogan visited Greece twice as prime minister in 2004 and 2010, but his visit as president has a symbolic meaning, as Mahmut Celal Bayar was the last Turkish president to land in Athens 65 years ago. For his part, Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades underlined the need to create the favorable conditions for the establishment of a state in Cyprus that guarantees security and peace and is not under the control of another state, referring to the occupation by Turkey of about 37 percent of the island. The Cypriot president also called on all sides to join forces and work together for the reunification of the island. He stressed the strong desire of the Greek Cypriot side to reach a settlement after the Turkish invasion of the island in 1974, pointing out that the only reason for not finding an acceptable solution so far was the \u201cTurkish intransigence.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nicos anastasiades", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmut celal bayar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdel sattar barakat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitris tzanakopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexis tsipras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prokopis pavlopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "asharq al-awsat erdogan makes historic visit", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asharq al-awsat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thrace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cyprus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aegean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ataturk international airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aegean sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:47.033+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b7a487c3a27cbfb206b1a3085dfa5e2a2e0c8514", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ggyp6BVN7BWKWMNin0zMhLs4NwmAZRWho4SbD8UxzOZRkEL.OJebdWJhugjVylIE.6NVz79X3wTnDLVtEt_YKjc6HncnE9Lvk32fWnwaG3uvzBrePUoAQECz1ahY6oac-", "site_full": "www.euroinvestor.com", "site": "euroinvestor.com", "site_section": "http://www.euroinvestor.com/news", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Latest Financial News, Stock News, Forex News and Commodity Market News - Euroinvestor ", "title": "DNA Plc: Managers' transactions - Jukka Leinonen", "title_full": "DNA Plc: Managers' transactions - Jukka Leinonen - Financial news Euroinvestor", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "DK", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b7a487c3a27cbfb206b1a3085dfa5e2a2e0c8514", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ggyp6BVN7BWKWMNin0zMhLs4NwmAZRWho4SbD8UxzOZRkEL.OJebdWJhugjVylIE.6NVz79X3wTnDLVtEt_YKjc6HncnE9Lvk32fWnwaG3uvzBrePUoAQECz1ahY6oac-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "euroinvestor.com", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "DNA Plc: Managers' transactions - Jukka Leinonen", "text": "DNA PLC, MANAGERS' TRANSACTIONS, 7 December, 2017 at 11:00 am EET\nThe following notification is made according to Article 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation.

Please Read!", "text": "I had been a really bad with drinking over the last ten or so years, and occasionally doing cocaine on weekends. Not a lot, but enough to get high on, and for a long time. About 6 months ago, I tried meth for the first time, and snorted it. A lot more than I should have and nearly OD'd.\nThe following month and 2 ER visits later over those two months for panic attacks and anxiety.\nThe ER docs didn't do anything except said to take tylenol for pain, although they said my D-Dimer score was around 2000 to 3000 and suspected a clot in my lung, but xray, ekg, ultrasounds, blood/urine tests and ct scans detected nothing. They sent me home and was ok for the next couple weeks, but not 100 percent as I thought I was just going through a come-down period from the OD.\nI finally got a script from a doctor/physician in June for buproprion (wellbutrin) when I told him what happened. Told me to see him in a month or call if the medication produced any weird side effects, and in the meantime see a counselor (in which I have seen every other week until first week of October in which we agreed once every two or three months was good). Great! I had an anxiety pill, and on the right track to recovery. So I thought...\nI went into the ER again for another major panic attack just a couple weeks later (just two weeks after starting buproprion 150mg) at night while in bed, turned out I had costochondritis with major chest pains which gives you heart attack symptoms and possibly caused my anxiety. Sharp pain in my left pectoral area near my heart, and down my arm. Hurt like hell. Also nausea. EKG and scans still turned up nothing on my heart, but they did find inflammation in my chest as suspected. They prescribed me prilosec for gas and intestinal issues, and ibuprofin for the pain. I saw my doctor the following day as I had made an appointment the previous day suspecting the pain wasn't right, but had to go to the ER before even making it. My physician gave me xanax, .25, to take for the tremors and rising pains which releaved any jitters or chest pain immediately. I have taken, and still only take one pill a day, two if absolutely needed but haven't in over two weeks since starting xanax. Once a day seems right as I get jittery mainly at night.\nA month later, I was laying in bed and had a sharp pain in my chest area nearly sent me through the roof. I took a xanax, and immediately called the doctor in which I was told to come in the following day and don't take my wellbutrin anymore. When I went to see him, we checked me out again, everything turned up fine. Nothing wrong with ekg, blood or urine. We switched me over to Paxil after a months treatment of Buproprion.\nI was on Paxil for three months with some side effects. I couldn't orgasm, lower back pain (some days I could barely walk), and some other minor discomforts. But overall my anxiety had dissipated and kept in control. There was a week where I didn't take any xanax at all when I went on vacation to colorado. I think I took maybe 1 or 2 pills that whole week. Still took Paxil daily. That was recently in October.\nI still managed to go to work during all of this, and sometimes have had to call in due to shakiness, fatigue, etc. Or when getting adjusted to my meds. Took a lot out of me.\nRecently, as of two weeks ago, I have been getting Headaches every single day, and they last all day and night. Tylenol has minimal help. My doc and I thought it could be Paxil causing them as I also had the back pains, so we switched to lexapro as my main symptoms seemed to be anxiety and I read a lot of great things about it. Meanwhile, the doctor also had me take an allergy shot, allergy test, and sent me home with Singulair pills, and an antibiotic (the one that treats syphillis, tons of I-TUS issues, and other things). None of those seemed to have helped with my headaches.\nI've been taking Lexapro this last week and while my anxiety remains somewhat in check, at night I feel my whole body jitter and keeps me awake. My wrists, head, and upper body mostly. Sometimes my arms, shoulders and hands twitch randomly. I've tried taking my xanax with tylenol which helps somewhat, but I don't want to be dependent on this method if there is something else that can help me with this uncontrollable jitteriness, shakiness, and massive headache that I have had for going on over a week now.\nDuring the time period from May to now, I have drank a few times, total of 5. And stupidly enough did Cocaine once, but that was over two months ago and nothing came of it. It's been about a month since I have drank any alcohol at all.\nAny recommendations on medications? Types of Specialists? Should I see a Psychologist? Neurologist? Am I even on the right medication for my history experiences? Could my medication be causing this? Am I just having withdraws from not drinking as much? Or from the long tenure of cocaine use?\nI asked my doctor all these questions before switching to lexapro and adding the other medications. Doesn't seemed to have helped any. Just reduced the symptoms slightly. They really didn't have a straight answer, maybe I need to get another doctor opinion as well.\nAny help with this would be greatly appreciated if you have had a past experience, or if any other doctors read this, any advice for a patient with my history and symptoms would be greatly appreciated.\nThank You", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:48.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b64c4d37ae99d46e2b27e2ea4ac3693c947cc6fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRjqLEK5IXQp9PMZCHADAqILiOTgE1jSgDT1Q.nOBMAAk7KT7dMmbv0We3p9Hwwb79pFmTn1gn45fg_FN1Rzseaafr83cAyk6qzeAJlMOgrLYGJq8p0ddmGEngLa_Qs480QrNB_LsPA7EFZtq2_FcPGs.j4j2TMBBOCm4Nw8L87QfSPBwWBRfM1", "site_full": "patient.info", "site": "patient.info", "site_section": "https://patient.info/forums/discuss/browse/health-anxiety-disorder-3379", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Anxiety Disorders.

After months of incredible tournament action, the Capcom Pro Tour comes to its conclusion with Capcom Cup 2017. \n32 of the best Street Fighter 5 players in the world will slug it out for over $370,000, a trophy with their name on it, and the title of champion. \nThey say that in order to have a clue to where you're going, you should look at where you've been. Tonight, we're going to do just that with the Capcom Cup finals. \nIn honor of this weekend's upcoming action, let's take a look back at the Capcom Cup 2016 top 8 matches. \nIn the finals of last year's event we saw Liquid|NuckleDu, EG|Ricki Ortiz, GGP|Kazunoko, GRPT|Haitani, GRPT|Fuudo, MOV, YouDeal|Yukadon, and CO|Go1. NuckleDu and Ricki Ortiz found themselves in the grand finals and closed out the event with an all-American player match-up. \nAfter a 3-1 loss to Du in winners finals, Ricki battled back by defeating Kazunoko's Cammy in the losers finals.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is on the race to break the deadlock on the issue of Irish border. Irish border is one of the three key issues required to be settled before the U.K can move on to the next stage of Brexit talk. The next phase of talk involves trade negotiation at the crucial EU summit on December 14.\nEarly on Monday, Ms. May met with EU leaders Jean Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk in Brussels to settle the terms of Brexit with the EU. The UK is reportedly prepared to accept that Northern Ireland may remain in the EU\u2019s custom union and single market. However, the potential agreement fell through at the last minute due to the intervention from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The Unionist party currently provides the Tories with a working majority in the Commons. The DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that she could not accept any Brexit deal that separates the Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.\nPound fell versus the dollar and reversed earlier rally as news about the failure to reach agreement started to surface\nThe EU says it will only recommend the start of talks about future trade arrangements when sufficient progress has been reached on three key issues: Status of expat citizens, the \u201cdivorce\u201d bill, and the Northern Ireland border. On the \u201cdivorce bill\u201d, the UK has increased its offer up to 50 billion Euros. On the issue of EU citizens in Britain, the UK agrees that they don\u2019t need to pay to apply for settled status if they already have permanent residence. However, those who apply for the first time for the right to stay will need to pay some fees.\nThe Sterling will remain volatile ahead of the upcoming EU leaders summit on December 14. However, a \u201cno deal exit\u201d would mean substantial wealth losses in both the UK and EU. It\u2019s therefore in everyone\u2019s best interest to seek progress. Interestingly, despite the lingering uncertainties around the U.K\u2019s exit from the EU, Sterling is still very resilient and ranks the top three best performing currency among G-10 peers this year\nSterling Technical Outlook\nTechnical positioning of two Sterling pairs confirm that the markets are becoming less sensitive to the ups and downs of the Brexit process. With some more breakthrough on the negotiation, Sterling could see more recovery in 2018, especially if the talks progress sufficiently to open up negotiations on trade.\nWe will take a look at two Sterling Crosses below: GBPAUD and GBPJPY\nGBPAUD Daily Technical Chart\nGBPAUD Daily chart shows a 7 swing bullish sequence from 10.7.2016 low and it appears the pair still could extend higher to 1.815 \u2013 1.862 area, provided that pivot at 8/25 low (1.615) stays intact. Please note that these numbers refer to swing counts and do not denote Elliott Wave labels, such as impulsive 5 waves.\nGBPJPY Daily Technical Chart\nGBPJPY also show 3 swing bullish sequence from the same pivot at 10.7.2016 low. The pair also appears to have scope to extend higher towards 161 \u2013 167 area, as far as pivot at 4/17 low (135.6) stays intact.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://elliottwave-forecast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Reselient-Pound.png", "https://elliottwave-forecast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Daily-GBPJPY-for-Sterling-Blog20171206001506.jpg", "https://elliottwave-forecast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Pound-Fell-after-Failure-of-Brexit-1024x583.png", "https://elliottwave-forecast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Daily-GBPAUD-for-Sterling-Blog20171206001359.jpg", "https://elliottwave-forecast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Pound-Fell-after-Failure-of-Brexit.png", "https://elliottwave-forecast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Reselient-Pound-1024x678.png", "https://elliottwave-forecast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Daily-GBPJPY-for-Sterling-Blog20171206001506-1024x525.jpg", "https://elliottwave-forecast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Daily-GBPAUD-for-Sterling-Blog20171206001359-1024x525.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:50.057+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dba1c6043fca9f10bb56112385d253a7ea205086", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg96oAVTi9WD5he_x0i3_Knz_JQc7FdxWXAjsMczMZKrDLWFawcRfiEjxFkmxiQ7RzNEmq0GNkDD3ruHxX3nU6eLNHQvzu5zSOXUrDzKdRduyw--", "site_full": "www.fusionlibrary.com", "site": "fusionlibrary.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Ileana says Ajay Devgn is easy to work with \u00bb Fusion Library", "title_full": "Ileana says Ajay Devgn is easy to work with \u00bb Fusion Library", "published": "2017-12-06T13:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.659, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dba1c6043fca9f10bb56112385d253a7ea205086", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg96oAVTi9WD5he_x0i3_Knz_JQc7FdxWXAjsMczMZKrDLWFawcRfiEjxFkmxiQ7RzNEmq0GNkDD3ruHxX3nU6eLNHQvzu5zSOXUrDzKdRduyw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T13:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "Ileana says Ajay Devgn is easy to work with \u00bb Fusion Library", "text": "Spread the love The Bollywood live wire will soon be seen in his cop avatar in...

Use a pastry cutter to add the butter to the flour mixture until it forms a pebbly, coarse texture. In a small bowl, combine the buttermilk and ice water. Kneading with your hands, add the buttermilk mixture, a teaspoon at a time, into the flour mixture. Pat the dough into a 4-inch round and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. \nPreheat the oven to 425\u00b0. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. \nPeel the pears, core them, and cut into \u00bc-inch slices. In a large bowl, toss the pear slices with the lemon juice. Sprinkle in the lemon zest, cornstarch, brown sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, and nutmeg. Toss until the pears are evenly coated. Set aside. \nFor the glaze, whisk the egg white, honey, and confectioners\u2019 sugar until frothy. Slowly whisk in the melted butter. Set aside. \nOn a lightly floured surface, roll the chilled dough into a 9-inch circle. Drape the dough over the rolling pin and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Arrange pear slices in concentric circles on top of the dough, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold the border over the filling, crimping dough to enclose ends of pears. \nBrush glaze over pears and bake for 15 minutes.

The Charming Kitten group is also known for the abuse of Open Source Security Tools, including the BeEF. \nThe threat actor targeted numerous entities in Iran, the U.S., Israel, the U.K. and other countries. The hackers also hit individuals involved in academic research, human rights, and the media. \nClearSky detailed the group\u2019s activities during 2016-2017, the report includes information related to the infrastructure used by the APT and to a new strain of malware dubbed DownPaper. \nThe report also linked the hacker behind the HBO security breach to the Charming Kitten , and reveals the identities of two other alleged members of the group. \nLast month, the United States charged the Iranian computer expert Behzad Mesri of \u2018 Games of Thrones \u2018 HBO Hack, the man was charged with stealing scripts and plot summaries for \u2018Games of Thrones\u2019. \nThe Manhattan US attorney Joon Kim said Mesri is \u201chad previously hacked computer systems for the Iranian military\u201d. The man threatened to release stolen data unless HBO paid a $6 million ransom in Bitcoin. \nProsecutors confirmed that the Iranian man was a member of the Iranian-based Turk Black Hat Security hacking group that targeted hundreds of websites in the United States and around the world. \n\u201cMESRI is an Iran-based computer hacker who had previously worked on behalf of the Iranian military to conduct computer network attacks that targeted military systems, nuclear software systems, and Israeli infrastructure.\u201d continues the DoJ. \n\u201cAt certain times, MESRI has been a member of an Iran-based hacking group called the Turk Black Hat security team and, as a member of that group, conducted hundreds of website defacements using the online hacker pseudonym \u201cSkote Vahshat\u201d against websites in the United States and elsewhere.\u201d \nExperts discovered that Masri and Charming Kitten were linked through the member of Turk Black Hat group \u201cArYaIeIrAN.\u201d another member of Turk Black Hat. \nThe email addresses associated with this individual have been used to register several domains used by the Charming Kitten. ClearSky also discovered that the same email address was also used by threat actors to registered a domain for an Iranian hosting firm named MahanServer, which has hosted Charming Kitten infrastructure. \n\u201cTo sum up, the HBO hacker \u2013 Behzad Mesri is a member of Turk Black Hat along with ArYaIeIrAn, who provides infrastructure for Charming Kitten activity via PersianDNS / Mahanserver together with Mohammad Rasoul Akbari, who is a Facebook friend of Behzad Mesri\u2019s.\u201d states the report . \u201cWe tend to identify ArYaIeIrAn with Mohammadamin Keshvari, because the latter is the only other employee of Mahanserver and works in a company whose domain was registered by the former (and both have a similar and unique profile picture). We estimate with medium certainty that the three are directly connected to Charming Kitten, and potentially, along with others \u2013 are Charming Kitten\u201d \nIranian hackers are becoming even more aggressive even if experts believe that they are not particularly sophisticated. \nRecently we discussed the OilRig gang has been using a new Trojan in attacks aimed at targets in the Middle East.

Getting our children to brush and floss is important, and we know that too much sugar can lead to cavities, but the challenge is getting them to think about those things. \nIt's not as hard as you might think \u2013 we started by visiting the Delta Dental of Colorado Foundation \u2019s exhibits at the Children\u2019s Museum of Denver at Marsico Campus ! We took our 8, 7, 5, and 3-year-old to The Teaching Kitchen and the Village of Healthy Smiles. It was so much fun that the kids   visit! Here are the tips they taught us, plus a few I\u2019ve found that work for our family: How to Teach Kids about Good Dental Hygiene \n1. Show them why they should drink less juice. The amount of sugar hidden in juice is astounding. The sugar from juice and other sugary beverages fuels bacteria that make acid, which eats through baby teeth enamel, causing cavities. The Teaching Kitchen is a great place for older children to learn more about hidden sugar in the foods and beverages we eat and drink! It was in The Teaching Kitchen that we learned some interesting facts about hidden sugar and dental hygiene. \nDid you know that one glass of orange juice can have almost the same amount of sugar as three donuts ? Even my kids were shocked! There was also a game where they tried to match the food and how much sugar was in each food. This presentation even held the attention of our three-year-old, so if you are bringing multiple ages to the museum like we did, don't be afraid to visit. \n2. Encourage them to drink more water. Water is important because it helps wash sugar off teeth from both other drinks and food. Bonus: Tap water is even better because it has fluoride which helps strengthen enamel. At The Teaching Kitchen, the kids were able to sample infused water (a great trick to get kids drinking more of it!) and even brainstorm different fruit combinations that would taste good together. \n3. Read stories. Children learn through play and stories. While at the Children's Museum, my youngest and I also visited the Village of Healthy Smiles \u2013 I'll admit that this section of the museum was my favorite! We sat in the Village\u2019s library area and read books about teeth, going to the dentist, and sugar bugs. We only read through them once and part of the time she was playing and I wasn't sure she was listening. A week or so later, we were driving down the road talking about something and she started talking about Doug the Sugar Bug who lives in her mouth. She remembered one of the books we read together! So we talked about sugar bugs and how important it was to brush our teeth so the sugar bugs didn't take up residence in our mouths and create cavities . \n4. Do whatever you can to make oral care exciting. For my kids, there is something about picking out their own toothbrush that excites them when it's time to brush their teeth. They run to the bathroom to grab their toothbrush, ask to set the timer for two minutes and brush away until the timer goes off! \n5. Create a routine. Both children and adults thrive on routines. Create a morning routine and an evening routine that includes flossing and brushing their teeth \u2013 not to mention the routine of seeing a dentist every six months. Soon, the new routine will become second nature. \nIn the Village of Healthy smiles, there is a dentist office with a chair and a \u201cpatient.\u201d The kids can clean the patient\u2019s teeth, and there is also a desk where they can make appointments on the computer and call patients to tell them when their next appointment is scheduled. It\u2019s a fun way to get them excited about the routine of visiting a provider! \n6. Model it. If you want your kids to have good dental hygiene , you have to show them how by doing it yourself. Floss and brush your teeth with them. If they see you making good oral health important, they will too. \n7. Remember that baby teeth matter . There is a misconception that baby teeth don't matter because they fall out. However, cavities can pass from baby teeth to adult teeth. Additionally, overall oral health has a big impact on the health of the body as a whole. It can even impact learning. Did you know that the leading cause of kids missing school in Colorado is because of dental decay? It's true! The health of those baby teeth is important. \n\nThank you to Delta Dental of Colorado Foundation\u2019 s Cavities Get Around campaign for sponsoring me today and sharing the importance of good oral health in children! 7 Shares", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "doug the sugar bug", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ways to teach kids about good dental hygiene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "children's museum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delta dental of colorado foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marsico campus", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "children\u2019s museum of denver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:19:53.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a68201b7d5107676731dbda05e908d358fab4d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8N2P6zVra5zItwpymSnjPog2bYw6KBGhtqlKrDGals7n_rtSIxfUvMXz1mGQdHRBGK4719IbEcZ4saGSqlkd4So9k3ZSR7cgqztToTjuEyzw--", "site_full": "www.blogigo.com", "site": "blogigo.com", "site_section": "http://blogigo.cn/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "www.blogigo.net", "title": "Another Option Is The Argon Gas Or Low-e Glasing That Admits Solar Heat In Winter And Reflects Heat In Summer.", "title_full": "Another Option Is The Argon Gas Or Low-e Glasing That Admits Solar Heat In Winter And Reflects Heat In Summer.", "published": "2017-12-07T11:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a68201b7d5107676731dbda05e908d358fab4d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8N2P6zVra5zItwpymSnjPog2bYw6KBGhtqlKrDGals7n_rtSIxfUvMXz1mGQdHRBGK4719IbEcZ4saGSqlkd4So9k3ZSR7cgqztToTjuEyzw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "Another Option Is The Argon Gas Or Low-e Glasing That Admits Solar Heat In Winter And Reflects Heat In Summer.", "text": "Significant Insights Dec 7, 2017 at 10:10 o\\clock by: everlessfsg98 \nThen the carpenter added the interior wood between the individual and safety glasses, why do you assume you are better and don't require those gears?
