Life could hardly be better. \nBut G\u2019s perfection hides dangerous secrets. When Daffy uncovers evidence of his infidelity, her perfect life seems to be in ruins. On their wedding anniversary, Daffy prepares to confront him, only to be stopped in her tracks when he foils a mugging attempt using wizard-level magic. \nSuddenly, Daphne is part of a world she never imagined\u2013where her husband is not a traveling troubleshooter for a software company, but the sheriff of the International Guild of Wizards, and her brilliant children are also budding magicians. Even she herself is not just a great baker and barista\u2013she\u2019s actually a kitchen witch. And her discovery of her powers is only just beginnning. \nBut even the midst of her chaotic new life, another problem is brewing. G\u2019s ex-wife, a dangerous witch, has escaped from her magical prison. Revenge-bent and blind, she needs the eyes of her son to restore her sight\u2013the son Daffy has raised as her own since he was a year old. Now Daphne must find a way to harness her new powers and protect her family\u2013or risk losing everything she holds dear. \nReview: I was very curious to discover this new story. How to resist such a cover, as well as a story of magic and wizards? \nI found it very nice for once to have a woman married with children. It is not necessarily the profile that we usually find and it was very pleasant to have it here. Daffy has always had the perfect life but everything will change the day she discovers that this is just a lie. Her husband is not the one he claims to be but a wizard, as well as their children. She also discovers that he has cheated on her several times and she can not forgive him! Asking him to leave their home, Daffy will have to face a world she did not know about. On top of that, the ex-wife of \u00c2\u0164\u00c2 G\u00c2 \u00c2\u0165 escaped from the prison where she was held captive and she wants to recover her son whom Daffy regards as hers. Daffy\u2019s entire family is in danger, and while she discovers that she has powers as well and that her divorce is underway, two men begin to turn around her in addition to her husband, but whom can she trust? Facing with her new life, we will discover Daffy\u2019s determination, as well as her desire to confront the lies of her husband whom she does not accept. \nI had a good time with this story and I found the whole very nice to read. However, I think that the story was quite disjointed and it is true that sometimes it was a bit complicated.

The 45-year-old filmmaker says 1960s saw films by Bimal Roy and Hrishikesh Mukherji , who highlighted social problems in their films, and these issues were dealt with utmost care on celluloid just how he has stayed honest to his story.\nDulquer Salmaan and Taapsee Pannu in Anurag Kashyap's next Manmarziyan is a love triangle that will kick off in January, most likely in Himachal Pradesh\nIn an interview, Kashyap said, \"We grew up in a time when we made socio-political films, filmmakers like Bimal Roy, Hrishikesh Mukherji, Raj Kapoor made films that dealt with elements in society about casteism, widows, unwed mothers etc. These films were appreciated by the audience but then we stopped making them but again that trend has come back (in films).\"\n\"Our film is about boxing, so we have to be honest to our story, it is about where do boxers come from, what is the status of boxing in society and the like.\" The film traces the story of a boxer from UP, named Shravan Singh, played by Vineet Kumar Singh, who belongs to a low caste and falls in love with a Brahmin woman.\nThings go south when he lands a punch on boxing federation head and politician-gangster, Bhagwan Das, part essayed by Jimmy Shergill. How the underdog Shravan fights - both for his rights and love - is what 'Mukkabaaz' is about. Producer of the film, Aanand L Rai questions the parameters of development in today's scenario.\n\"Tomorrow, if a filmmaker wants to make a story like 'Prem Rog' which was about child widow, will I be allowed to say (the story) now or will I be stopped? Similarly will I be allowed to keep the name of the character Ganga with a film like 'Ram Teri Ganga Maili'?\"\n\"...understand where are we going? Are we progressing? Is it progressive space for us or is it taking us backwards? It is not about makers or audience or media, we as country what is happening to us... Are we together to bring the change or are we accepting that?\" he asks.\nThe upcoming sports drama film received a standing ovation at this year's MAMI Film Festival and Kashyap said the response the film has garnered at several international film festivals is overwhelming. \"I was surprised that there is an audience for a film like this in the West. This is my third experience (with international audience). Every time I have gone out (to film festivals) with a film, we have got good response be it 'Dev D' or 'Gangs of Wasseypur' or 'Mukkabaaz'.\n\"Every time I have stemmed out and set out to thinking I want to make a story - not complex but relevant - that reaches out to audiences everywhere, it has worked. They have become bigger hits at the festivals,\" said the filmmaker. Kashyap said he fails to understand how the international audience understood the various elements of boxing in India from 'Mukkabaaz'.\n\"I recorded the reaction of the audience of an international festival and my team was amazed. They (referring to international audience) did not understand the context (of the film) but they enjoyed it. However, they did ask what the context was towards the end. Here, at MAMI, the reaction was extraordinary because they understood the context.\" \"It is high time our audience becomes a part of the global audience. You can't keep them aloof. You have to raise the audience to that level,\" he adds.\n'Mukkabaaz' marks the first collaboration between Kashyap and Rai as director and producer respectively. The duo next have 'Manmarziyan' in the pipeline, with Taapsee Pannu and Vicky Kaushal in the lead. Talking about their maiden outing together, Rai said Kashyap and him are quite similar as creative people.\n\"I know Anurag likes to tell stories and same is the case with me. I want to work with like-minded people as it makes your life easy. I had this story which I wanted to pitch to Anurag and I was looking for an opportunity where I will get Anurag to do something. I wanted to see him make one story.\"\n\"We both are not that money-minded we came together for love of the story. He was working on a story 'Mukkabaaz' and I was working on 'Manmarziyan'. So we went ahead with 'Mukkabaaz' and then we decided to go ahead with the other film.\" While Kashyap on a lighter note reveal that all directors usually end up meeting each other during each other's birthday parties and that is how the 'Gangs of Wasseypur' helmer met Rai.\n\"We (Rai and I) were done with our creative business in ten minutes.\"\nTaapsee Pannu, Vicky Kaushal and Dulquer Salmaan in Anurag Kashyap's 'Manmarziyan' 00:18\nMAMI 2017 1 62 MAMI 2017 Manoj Bajpayee attends the screening of 'In The Shadows' during the MAMI 19th Mumbai Film Festival in Mumbai.

pleasant. Her tent at the pier was exactly where she said. Directions were then given to walk to the location where the golf carts actually are kept. As I am somewhat limited in mobility, this would have been good to know ahead of time. Undeterred, we managed the short walk. There is no further signage which was also a little disconcerting, however we soon saw two smiling faces behind an unmarked desk and MANY golf carts. Apparently we were at the right place! $90 fee for the golf cart was now collected as was the $100 fully refundable deposit. We were given a rather poor, but typical tourist map and off we went. You really don\u2019t need a map, there is essentially One Way! You can\u2019t go too wrong. The golf cart itself was spectacular, well cared for and much, much speedier than your typical golf cart - I know, I drive them daily!\nThe ocean vistas are truly spectacular. Pull off to take photos though because you\u2019re sharing the road with regular traffic! I\u2019m definitely not used to sharing the way with a D8 Cat!! There was very little traffic and there is a rear view mirror in the cart. The salt flats, and slave huts are interesting to see as well. I wish I\u2019d have done a lot more research on the islands history ahead of time. The road mostly all winds along the ocean and there are many pull offs for snorkeling. Eventually we came to Lac Bay and the Sorbon Beach Club. This is a very lovely and welcoming resort. Mariska at the front desk invited us to walk thru the resort gardens to the beach where they offer for you to stay for the day for a nominal $5 fee, or $10 with a lounger! Good deal so another time, I would cab straight to the resort. Lac Bay itself is gorgeous. A little ways further down the road is a hot spot for windsurfing with a little shop and restaurant.\nWe passed about 15 flamingoes and 8 donkeys on our route. We could have stopped at a donkey sanctuary along the way had we been interested. As every time we\u2019ve been in Bonaire, it was scorching HOT! After three hours we were ready to return the jaunty cart. Debbie and Tamara were surprised to see us back and offered to let us use the cart further after we\u2019d had a refreshment. We asked if there\u2019d be a nice little restaurant nearby or if we should just get back on the ship. Tamara, ever so kindly and helpfully took us in a cart to Karel\u2019s Beach Bar. Karels is the place right on the water that you can plainly see from the ship. Parched as can be, we welcomed the breeze, the spectacular view and the shade! Thank you and good suggestion Tamara. I gobbled up THE most delicious frozen mocha. Seriously, they called it World Famous, and for sure I\u2019ll not forget it!! We also shared a dish of nachos which is probably not their most stellar dish. Nachos smothered in fake cheese product and A LOT of beef. The restaurant does have slow wifi depending on where you sit! There is about a one block walk back to the ship, thru the shops and market stalls. Careful on the sidewalks though.\nAll in all, it was a great day. I\u2019m going home to learn about the salt mounds and the slave huts!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:14.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0915979b55a53e150a21044a59455cc3cb3d4a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm3iK3.l6cMfL7DkZ7tJ.By8", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=ty montgomery", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "ty%20montgomery News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "Cowboys\u2019 stunting defensive line poses big challenge for ailing Redskins - The Washington Post", "title_full": "Cowboys\u2019 stunting defensive line poses big challenge for ailing Redskins - The Washington Post : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-11-29T21:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f0915979b55a53e150a21044a59455cc3cb3d4a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm3iK3.l6cMfL7DkZ7tJ.By8", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Washington Post", "published": "2017-11-29T21:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Cowboys\u2019 stunting defensive line poses big challenge for ailing Redskins - The Washington Post", "text": "The Washington Redskins travel to Dallas to take on the Cowboys on Thursday night.

pact with its former Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Rajiv Bansal who quit the company in October 2015, said the IT major on Wednesday. \"The settlement application has been submitted to the market regulator - Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on former CFO's severance pact made in October 2015,\" said the company in a regulatory filing on the BSE. The settlement application process is based on an undertaking that the company will \"neither admit or deny finding of fact or conclusion of law\". \"Through the settlement process, the company wants to resolve allegations relating to company not seeking prior nod from its Nomination iamp; Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee for the severance package,\" reiterated the filing. The company, however, did not disclose the severance agreement, cessation of payments to Bansal and initiation of arbitration. \"The company will provide update on conclusion of settlement process,\" noted the filing. The company's co-founders, especially its former Chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy objected to the \"unusual and unprecedented severance payment agreement of 1,000 per cent\" approved by the previous Board to Bansal. Accusing the previous board of poor governance on October 24, Murthy said in a statement that it (previous Board) also did not disclose the information on the pact proactively and much earlier. Murthy's public spat with some of the previous Board members led to the dramatic exit of its first non-promoter Chief Executive Vishal Sikka on August 18 three years after he joined and the return of another co-founder Nandan N. Nilekani to the Board as non-executive Chairman on in August. On December 2, Infosys hired Salil S Parekh of global IT outsourcing firm Capgemeni as its new CEO and Managing Director from January 2.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bansal infosys", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bansal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sof", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "murthy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajiv bansal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salil s parekh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.r. narayana murthy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vishal sikka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nandan n. nilekani", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "infosys", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "securities exchange board of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "audit committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capgemeni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "remuneration committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sebi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:14.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "54f2294ddf71f9136826bb1cff3c32b97555e0a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzDollsPHA4Ru.8XIJgsJomcvgtmvDCICA_CQxsrglHKofZstaitffUAc_Eg8ks6f5boXhvk0ondU8niwIBF_yfB6AuRVAtkyDRALWWKYlDmL4sCDuSc03NJKY3jYC3YWKP_XOPPmFcg--", "site_full": "cofremantle.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "http://cofremantle.wordpress.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "City of Fremantle Mayor Brad Pettitt's Blog", "title": "The Fremantle Network Returns Monday with a Focus on Community.", "title_full": "The Fremantle Network Returns Monday with a Focus on Community.", "published": "2017-12-07T11:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54f2294ddf71f9136826bb1cff3c32b97555e0a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzDollsPHA4Ru.8XIJgsJomcvgtmvDCICA_CQxsrglHKofZstaitffUAc_Eg8ks6f5boXhvk0ondU8niwIBF_yfB6AuRVAtkyDRALWWKYlDmL4sCDuSc03NJKY3jYC3YWKP_XOPPmFcg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mayor of Fremantle Brad Pettitt's blog", "published": "2017-12-07T11:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "The Fremantle Network Returns Monday with a Focus on Community.", "text": "December 7, 2017 Leave a comment \nThe final TFN event for 2017 welcomes two local speakers who are working on community initiatives that create vibrant, connected local communities. \nMonday 6pm \u2013 Upstairs at the National Hotel \nDean Cracknell \u2013 Town Team Movement \nThe Town Team Movement is an \u2018under-arching\u2019 non-profit organisation helping town teams to organise, engage and empower their communities and create better places. Town teams are a model where businesses, residents, community groups and local governments work collaboratively to create great places. The teams are: independent; not politically aligned; and a positive voice and influence in their community. Each team has slightly different priorities and focuses, but all share these principles. There are currently 18 town teams in Perth and this number is growing quickly! Dean is a local resident who is keen to help this grassroots movement to grow and flourish in Fremantle. \nMaureen Maher \u2013 Street by Street \nStreet by Street is a national project that aims to turn streets into communities and foster an Australia-wide network of neighbour groups. Maureen has been involved in a neighbourhood group in Hilton and wants other neighbourhoods to benefit from the initiative. A strong sense of community, where you know the people that live near you, share experiences and help one another, makes life is richer. But for many neighbourhoods, this type of connection isn\u2019t happening naturally. The Street by Street Project helps people build better connections with neighbours, so that more of us can feel a sense of community. They see regular, informal social get-togethers as the pathway to creating community and are working for connected communities to become the norm across Australia, and for people to feel happier, safer and more supported as a result. \nCome along, be inspired and get involved in making Freo an even better place through these great projects.

I\u2019m making my debut and I\u2019m glad I have other female players in the team who have won medals. If I can bench 160kg, I know I can win gold. I\u2019m aiming for nothing less.\u201d Nooh breaks national record \nSaniha knows better than to be complacent about though. \u201cIt is important to train constantly; both powerlifting and weightlifting are challenging sport, I find weightlifting to be easier and of course powerlifting is something which I\u2019ve just started. However, both are strength sports and require top form,\u201d she said. \nAlong with Saniha, 2015 Asian Championship gold medallist Twinkle Sohail will be representing the country in the 72kg category, Rabia Razzaq will be in the 84kg competition while Sybil Sohail will be showing her talent in 47kg. The four-woman contingent makes it Pakistan\u2019s biggest in any powerlifting event. Olympic gold the holy grail for Nooh, Talib \nIn the men\u2019s categories, Mehmood Hera and teenager Muhammad Ahmed Khan will represent Pakistan in 120kg, Syed Nadeem Hashmi will lift in the 105kg event and Pakistan Powerlifting Federation (PPF) secretary Rashed Malik will be in action in the masters three category for above 60-year-old players. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve had this image of Pakistan that we can\u2019t produce quality female powerlifters, we feel that this championship will certainly change that image,\u201d said Malik. \nThe championships in Singapore will be featuring 148 athletes from different countries including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and China among others.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rabia razzaq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twinkle sohail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammad ahmed khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "talib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mehmood hera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rashed malik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sybil sohail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saniha ghafoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saniha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syed nadeem hashmi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nooh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karachi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan powerlifting federation", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:15.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aad76202c43c55bc19b8c14dd15bd0ce8c107780", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOibZnlQb_tMCymyVUFx2nWgr2UtWYbwUd.FW87diUO6e8JAn2ZTKkYOOCCsVb8LW4UkpmGzAqWeonp9W.QL4AiOY05I7M.aXdSj1ahKpB466_SStjlTQoFa1UYVe9sL78DjpRebQo2KLgZUZggAljJ5_N2slrZllnxvLbxjbEtFjcAzDQMqg3qPqQbDBf25p9g7Pp_GnfeQYw", "site_full": "www.freeads.co.uk", "site": "freeads.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.freeads.co.uk/uk/recent/rss", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Recent Free Ads in the UK", "title": "Bsa r10 .22 mk2 carbine full bowkett blueprint", "title_full": "Bsa r10 .22 mk2 carbine full bowkett blueprint", "published": "2017-12-07T09:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static1.freeads.co.uk/img/280x211/003055a73a1671f2f493bd1772640e47eaf55bcc.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 22529, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aad76202c43c55bc19b8c14dd15bd0ce8c107780", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOibZnlQb_tMCymyVUFx2nWgr2UtWYbwUd.FW87diUO6e8JAn2ZTKkYOOCCsVb8LW4UkpmGzAqWeonp9W.QL4AiOY05I7M.aXdSj1ahKpB466_SStjlTQoFa1UYVe9sL78DjpRebQo2KLgZUZggAljJ5_N2slrZllnxvLbxjbEtFjcAzDQMqg3qPqQbDBf25p9g7Pp_GnfeQYw", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "Bsa r10 .22 mk2 carbine full bowkett blueprint", "text": "Congratulations, you will now receive ads and updates from Carl.

I've posted on this site in the last couple of days under the heading: 'CHRONIC PAIN SUFFERERS' PLEASE READ THIS. It has information that is directed at folks like you. I assume since you have been taking oxycontin for a while that you have insurance. You need to get with your ins. company and get a list of Dr's within the distance you are willing to travel, which in my case was ALASKA, (luckily I live in Dallas so there are plenty of Dr's to choose from) and also for pain Dr's that use the Spinal Chord Stimulator or the Intrathecal Morphine Pump. These are valid treatments for chronic pain. They both require a long term commitment. I actually have both. But the stimulator is no longer operating. However, the pain pump is doing wonderful, although it takes months, sometimes years to titrate the dose up to a therapeutic level, so they don't kill you in the process. They will increase it about 10% every few months as needed. I'm not there yet, and I've had it for 15 months. The Dr who implants the pump should continue your oral meds and decrease them slowly as the pump is increased. I don't know what your pain source is, but this information is something you will probably have to find on your own. You obviously have access to the internet which is your best tool. I would give you my email address but I'm sure you understand why I can't. I'll get a notification when you respond to my response. Good luck. You are on my prayer list. My wife passed away at 43 due to debilitating pain from three different diseases that required more medicine you were on before. I have Diabetic Nerve pain, along with Crohns Disease. A double whammy. So I know what it's like. Sometimes even your family won't believe you on how severe your pain is. It's not like a broken bone, gunshot wound etc that is visible. And it's even harder to convince a Dr sometimes. The addicts and drug seekers have really ruined it for us. I know they are trolling this site and I don't care. I've stated before, they need to be in a rehab, not on here trying to find a new way to feel high. That's why I don't give out my email.

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) partnered with GE and the non-governmental organisation to revive the lake, upkeep environment and create a cleaner and greener community. \"The treated water replenishes the lake. Our volunteer teams found that it (lake) had many inlets that allowed sewage to seep into it, forming silt and reducing its storage capacity by almost half. The garbage pile-up had detrimental effect on the lake spread over 30 acres, environment and area people. Its restoration has increased water level by six inches in six months and helped flora and fauna florish, Makhija said. The civic body (BBMP) will invest in cleaning, maintaining and fencing surrounding the lake. GE and United Way have also built six eco-friendly toilets, including one for differently abled to prevent open defecation near the lake and maintain cleaner environment. \"We will maintain the lake for two years and plant 5,000 saplings in surrounding area,\" United Way Chief Executive Manish Michael said.

Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday said the access to credible information makes a democracy more \"progressive, participatory and meaningful\". \"Indeed, the adoption of the citizens' Right to Information has enabled each citizen to be better informed and more actively participate in the governance of the country. Citizens now have confirmation that the information is authentic. This can be potential ammunition to fight injustice and cleanse the polity,\" Naidu said. Inaugurating the 12th annual convention of the Central Information Commission, he said: \"It is significant to note that even those countries which are not formally democratic in structure have come up with some form of Right to Information. For a nation which has adopted democracy as a political system, the Right to Information is even more of an imperative.\" He said Kautilya's \"Arthashastra\" advocates a free flow of communication between the king and his subjects and in modern times the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognises Right to Information as a human right. The Vice President said that the RTI enables greater government accountability, facilitates citizens' participation and lends transparency to government functioning. \"In India, a sea change can be seen in the systems of governance and the attitude of government agencies since adoption of the RTI Act. Also, a clear attitudinal change is visible in public authorities dealing with matters concerning public services and citizens' expectations,\" he said. He observed that over the past decade, citizens' expectations have changed and from a once-in-five-years exercise of electoral choice, they now expect to be regularly consulted in matters directly concerning them. The Vice President hoped that the discussions at the convention will lead to \"substantive recommendations\" which will help further advance \"the cause of RTI in our country\".", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "m. venkaiah naidu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naidu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kautilya", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ians", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "central information commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations universal declaration of human rights", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:16.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a110b55d13b799db348e54fd0762d1a518942a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.VfFpiDEjCb28fKCI59haRKlspCvu3huN_RPlOJdckOZRgKxs3HsbtR5zzTbDAyyk8R7uyF6zVpBvDUANIAo8ycZUxTEQSqcHw9dwZivOdtPCneW4PAPyBHor1k6jecP2anA6wlTu6oI9YOYksKTW69", "site_full": "kneb.com", "site": "kneb.com", "site_section": "http://kneb.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "KNEBKNEB", "title": "Senator Stinner and Lt.

The victim, a 52-year-old woman, told police she was walking her dog Joey, a Chihuahua mix, in the 600 block of Brunswick Street around 4:30 p.m. when two unleashed dogs ran toward her from across the street. \nThe woman picked Joey up, but the two dogs knocked her to the ground and then attacked the Chihuahua. The attack was so vicious that the victim was dragged across the pavement as she held on to Joey\u2019s leash in an effort to protect him, police said. The dogs killed the Chihuahua, and then ran away east on Lowell Street. A male subject who is thought to be the dogs\u2019 owner left the area without expressing any remorse or providing contact information, police said. \nA bystander helped the victim take Joey to a veterinary hospital on Mission Street, where he died. Police today released photos of the dogs and asked anyone who recognizes them or knows their owner to contact them. \u201cThe sudden and unprovoked attack on the victim and the fatal mauling of \u2018Joey\u2019 indicates that these dogs are a risk to public safety and must be seized pending a vicious and dangerous dog hearing,\u201d police said in a statement. \nThe dogs were described as pit bulls or similar breeds. One of them was brown and white with a pink collar, weighing around 70 pounds. The second was brown, weighing around 80 pounds and wearing a gray collar. \nCopyright 2017 by Bay City News, Inc. \u2014 Republication, Rebroadcast or any other Reuse without the express written consent of Bay City News, Inc. is prohibited.

Or, those among you who\u2019ve rehabbed houses. Or, built you\u2019re own power plant. You know who you are. \nHere\u2019s the situation: \nThe house in which Aged P and I reside was built in 1958, in a Southeast L.A. County tract. The walls surrounding the back yard (Cinder Block?; Concrete Block? I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s called,, really), are, well, I\u2019m surprised any of them are still standing at all \u2013 no rebar. All three of the walls have been falling apart for years. There\u2019s one section of one side wall (@22\u2019, from midpost to back corner) that\u2019s mostly in a heap in the next-door neighbor\u2019s yard, and desperately needs to be replaced. We\u2019ve had a number of estimates that were, quite frankly, shocking. All the walls, at least on this side of the street, are leaning over, one way or other, have openings where blocks have departed over the years due to a combination of earthquakes and trees that looked really good when they were planted way too close to the walls. In our yard, there\u2019s only one tree that grew from a root of unknown origin \u2013 a volunteer, actually \u2013 that stands about 4-1/2\u2019 from the wall in question. It\u2019s my beloved Chinese Flame (AKA Lantern) tree that sprang up long after a previous, much bigger, much closer to the wall, tree had been removed, long ago, decades ago. She\u2019s in the aforementioned corner of the yard. On the other side of the back wall \u2013 adjacent to my tree \u2013 are a Carolina Pine and a Queen Palm that are each against the back wall and, in point of fact, are holding up what\u2019s left of that part of the crumbling back wall, for several years, now. \nThe estimates we\u2019ve gotten on that 22\u2019 section involve removal of the broken wall (which, having been built in 1958, is made of a block thickness that some turdbush, mouth-breathing, inbred, knuckle-dragging group pf bureaucrats in Sacotomatoes decided, some time ago, are unacceptable), must be replaced with thicker bricks), so new material is factored into the price, which ranges from $2200 to $2500. To me, THAT\u2019S the unacceptable part of it all. The neighbors on the side of the wall into which the wall has fallen seem to be somewhat sullen about it. They offered, unbidden, to share the cost. (Dad, a few weeks ago and had gone next door to beg use of their phone when he thought he\u2019d locked himownbadself out of the house while I was thirty miles away, on a Friday afternoon, which translates into a two-hour drive. They got to talking about t then. My plan was to not even broach the subject with them, leaving it up to them to insert themowbadselves into the situation at their will, when they\u2019d see the work being done. (I don\u2019t like these people, and I think they likely hold us (or, me) responsible for trees that were planted before my birth, as well as earthquakes.) Nonetheless, because Dad had discussed the matter with them, and told me that they were going to seek other estimates, I found myownbadself in the unenviable position of having face time with one of them and talking over the various estimates we had variously obtained with the \u201cshe\u201d half of the \u201cthem,\u201d a couple weeks ago, I suggested that the best go-to would be the two wall men whose company names that include the word \u201cmasonry,\u201d and whose estimates were in the middle of the range, whilst she was inclined to hire the guy whose flyer begins with the word \u201clandscaping\u201d, and, who gave the highest estimate. She said she\u2019d talk it over with the \u201chim,\u201d and would call me. I have heard from neither \u201cher,\u201d nor \u201chim,\u201d since. Neither have I seen either of them outside their house since. (This is not unusual \u2013 since they retired, their wont has been to hole up in their yurt, and rarely venture into the sunshine). \nSo, I woke up this morning, and instead of the regular \u201cWell, that\u2019s a surprise,\u201d (that I woke up at all), \u201cWhat about a Cedar, or Redwood, fence to replace the entire, roughly, 60\u2019 side wall?\u201d The estimates (for the 22\u2019 section of block) were $2200, two $2250s, and a $2500 \u2013 the \u201cLandscaper.\u201d \nThis is where you, my Beloved Buddies come in. I trust all of you people infinitely more than anything I may Google. Can you ball-park the cost of the removal of a roughly 60\u201d Block Wall and replacement with a Cedar or Redwood, 6\u2019 fence? And, to any of my fellow Golden Staters, whose brains are bigger than mine with regard to such matters: Given the exigencies of all the crap that constantly lands on us any time the brain-trusts in Sacotomatoes poop out a new idea to improve their leftist \u201cUtopia,\u201d is it even legal to erect a wooden fence between two yards, one of which has a swimming pool (not ours)? As an example of our illustrious legislature and bureaucratic State\u2019s efforts: I recently found out that, if you wish to engage in the private sale of a cemetery plot or two, betwixt the Glorious State and the cemetery itself (mandated, of course, by the knuckle-dragging paper-pushers upstate) the considerably fat wad of cash that leaves the buyer\u2019s hand will weigh less than half as much, by the time it reaches the seller\u2019s hands. And, one more: We have, at our doorstep, the biggest ocean on the planet, which through desalination \u2013 a technology that\u2019s been in active use for as long as there have been submarines, aircraft carriers, a thriving agricultural industry in Israel, and two desal plants on Catalina Island \u2013 has kept at least two planned, and begun, desalination plants locked up in red tape for years. \nThere. I\u2019ve said it. I hereby pass the talking stick. \nThank you. And, I apologize. -- Mark   2042 posts in 893  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "golden staters", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carolina pine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "catalina island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast l.a. county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sacotomatoes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "redwood", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:17.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "92eb45f9e8ef375cf685bc7a67763c60553d8ff6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_cNbRVLTtd7mRC8rLrYfKCTENmj4c8122g0RxPilAY4wPvcLAhMaNWx2oqzdNxvIezXa8sYce_ZEZnulXurvIDhu0Q60gWZfQftuu_pe2qfz7MkV85oQCiqpgiHuYhrt0g--", "site_full": "forums.anandtech.com", "site": "anandtech.com", "site_section": "https://forums.anandtech.com/forums/operating-systems.11/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Operating Systems - AnandTech Forums", "title": "Why does Microsoft \"give up\"?

$700,000 in Watches Taken December 6, 2017 Add Comment \nPolice believe a brazen daytime smash-and-grab robbery at a high-end Manhattan watch boutique is linked to a similar incident last year. Authorities say the bandit hit the A. Lange & Sohne store on Madison Avenue between East 66th and 67th streets around 11 a.m. Tuesday and got away with approximately 14 watches worth an estimated $700,000. \nThe suspect reportedly displayed a silver automatic handgun and smashed a display case inside the store before fleeing the scene. The NYPD has now linked this robbery to a similar one at a Madison Avenue jewelry store in November of 2016, in which two suspects used a gun and claw hammer to smash several display cases inside the Jaeger-LeCoultre jewelry store.

to Nigeria. Switzerland to Return Over $320m of Abacha Family Loot to Nigeria. by 10:19:00 in NEWS   Switzerland will return to Nigeria around $321 million in assets seized from the family of former military ruler Sani Abacha via a deal signed with the World Bank on Monday, the Swiss government said. Transparency International, a corruption watchdog, has accused Abacha of stealing up to $5 billion of public money during the five years he ran the oil-rich country, from 1993 until his death in 1998. In 2014, Nigeria and the Abacha family reached an agreement for the West African country to get back the funds, which had been frozen, in return for dropping a complaint against the former military ruler\u2019s son, Abba Abacha. The son was charged by a Swiss court with money-laundering, fraud and forgery in April 2005, after being extradited from Germany, and later spent 561 days in custody. In 2006, Luxembourg ordered that funds held by the younger Abacha be frozen. Now Switzerland, Nigeria and the World Bank have agreed the funds will be repatriated via a project supported and overseen by the World Bank, the Swiss government said. \u201cThe project will strengthen social security for the poorest sections of the Nigerian population. The agreement also regulates the disbursement of restituted funds in tranches and sets out concrete measures to be taken in the event of misuse or corruption,\u201d it added.

Specifically that a case like United States v Nieves-Casta\u00f1o directly contravenes Heller, makes the law suspect. That was not a carry case, but it's not the only defect. LEOSA also offers no protection against the act. Neither does defending your life, a clear interpretation of the 2A, gets a pass as discharge is only permitted by LEO in official capacity in the school zone.\nIf you don't believe me, ask how in a constitutional carry state, like Vermont without any permitting apparatus, there are no GFSZA prosecutions, and that people aren't committing violations of the GFSZ act regularly.\nI had heard some states are looking at changing their laws so that reciprocal permits and constitutional carry was \"licensed\" in the sense that it removed the violation of the GFSZA. Don't have time right now to google it.\nETA: can't find any info on states adopting a \"licensed\" language law.
