I would perch myself on top of the wooden fence and would try to entice the children from the daycare center next-door to talk to me.  I would offer gifts of tangerines as bribes.  If they wouldn't succumb to citrus, I would hold their toys hostage.  \"Play with me or I'll bury your action figure.\"\n\nWhen I got older, the wooden barrier was replaced with an invisible one.  Instead of gifts of fruit, I would offer up other things.  I would dangle my time, my energy, myself.  And if that didn't work, clearly it was them... not me. \n\nI had always wanted others to like me.  I would go to such incredibly stupid lengths to get people to acknowledge and accept me.  Like me.  Be my friend.  Give me the love that I can't give myself.\n\nWhen you claim your personal power, it becomes apparent that not all relationships are healthy ones.  Healthy relationships build off of each other and grow exponentially.  The energy in a healthy relationship is cyclical and builds momentum and force.  There's a magic in finding others who click. \n\nOnce we find others who we click with, it's so tempting to try to hold on and never let them go.  But sometimes relationships are like leaves.  We want to hoard them, pressing them between the pages of a book, and keeping them frozen in time.  But these golden moments don't last forever.  Even with the utmost vigilance, they can fade and become brittle.  I remember finding a dictionary at an antique store once and within it were pressed flowers.  Such a lovely discovery, but the moment I opened it, they started to fall apart and disintegrate.  Sometimes those leaves must be given back to the earth so that they take their role in a bigger cycle of growth and decay and renewal.  Everything has a season.\n\nUpon learning of a friend's death, I am reminded of this.  Cherish the people in your life that make you MORE.  Honor the time you have together and be the best person you can be \u2013 not only for others in your life, but for yourself as well.  Drink in the nourishment of the people and experiences that enrich your life and be thankful for their gifts.  Their time with you may be short, shorter than anyone could ever predict.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:04.123+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12c0a31980c8cfc0eef4bc361c52e2c518a2704a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmklcHNwS2XogJxhrbuw1jM5XzTKZwxMzAt2HDxyHyfDcHhQ1aksrpiFRLYsnM6pYhHvGDMOddvi_svX0don1OKx2nBCHtSd4lIQshA9LEuTuV5ACgyXuAVDuYpflqO6dRpq0zjR_dHnog--", "site_full": "referbookmarks.com", "site": "referbookmarks.com", "site_section": "http://referbookmarks.com/rss.php?category=&status=&group=", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "ReferBookmarks | Published News", "title": "Coolest Light Decor Ideas For Your Christmas Night Celebrations!", "title_full": "Coolest Light Decor Ideas For Your Christmas Night Celebrations!", "published": "2017-12-07T10:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "12c0a31980c8cfc0eef4bc361c52e2c518a2704a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmklcHNwS2XogJxhrbuw1jM5XzTKZwxMzAt2HDxyHyfDcHhQ1aksrpiFRLYsnM6pYhHvGDMOddvi_svX0don1OKx2nBCHtSd4lIQshA9LEuTuV5ACgyXuAVDuYpflqO6dRpq0zjR_dHnog--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "partyvapours", "published": "2017-12-07T10:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "Coolest Light Decor Ideas For Your Christmas Night Celebrations!", "text": "Coolest Light Decor Ideas For Your Christmas Night Celebrations!

It took the Barbarians just five minutes to open the scoring when, following a cleanly won lineout, fly-half Robert du Preez - one of four South Africans in the Barbarians starting XV - checked the Springbok defence with a show-and-go before Blues full-back Melani Nanai showed good strength to cross in the corner.

Taqele Naiyaravoro powers over to finish a classic Barbarians try Four minutes into the second half, though, the Springboks led for the first time in the match. Van Rensburg, in his first South Africa appearance, made a clever break that saw him release wing Sergeal Petersen, whose angled run under the posts set up an easy conversion for Lambie.But amid numerous replacements and after they had a score disallowed for a knock-on, the Barbarians regained the lead in the 55th minute.A counter-attack move involving flankers Jordan Taufua and Brad Shields ended with Nanai finding Morahan for a well-worked try converted by fellow substitute Richard MoUnga.Morahan was on hand again in the 67th minute for another converted try when he exploited a gap in South Africas defensive line after a strong drive by the Barbarians forwards.

Mellow leaves the William J. Nealon Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse on Nov. 30, 2012, after being sentenced to 16 months in federal prison for conspiracy to defraud the government and commit wire fraud. (Times-Tribune File) \nBoard members of the State Employees Retirement System who voted to restore corrupt former state Sen. Bob Mellow\u2019s ludicrously lucrative state pension obviously have betrayed the public trust. They have set a terrible precedent and have eliminated the loss of pension benefits as a deterrent against crimes like Mellow\u2019s. \nThe decision reveals the need for significant reforms and advises prosecutors that they must include pension forfeiture in plea deals with corrupt Pennsylvania politicians. \nMellow, a Lackawanna County Democrat who spent 40 years in the Senate, pleaded guilty in 2012 to a federal charge related to his use of publicly paid staffers for political purposes, and for filing a false federal tax return in 2008. He served 16 months in federal prison. \nThe retirement system twice rejected Mellow\u2019s efforts to retain his pension but the board, in a 6-5 vote announced Tuesday, restored it. \nPension itself preposterous \nProblems with Mellow\u2019s pension begin with its size. According to The Associated Press, it is worth $245,000 a year, more than $20,000 a month. Mellow, of course, was a member of the legislative leadership in 2001 when lawmakers unconscionably increased the size of their own pensions by 50 percent. As such, he is among the architects of the current state pension disaster. The two big pension plans are underfunded by about $70 billion, and the cost of backfilling that hole has hamstrung the state government and every school district in the state. \nThat a supposed public servant can leave office under any circumstance with a $245,000 annual pension defines a corrupt government. That a convicted felon can walk away with such a massive publicly funded pension puts an exclamation point on it. \nSenators should recuse themselves \nTwo of the six votes to restore Mellow\u2019s pension came from two of Mellow\u2019s former colleagues who are members of the board \u2014 Democrat Vincent Hughes of Philadelphia and Republican Charles McIlheny of Bucks County. A third was a representative, Republican Robert Godshall of Montgomery County. \nIt\u2019s one thing for legislators to sit on the board for determining policy but it\u2019s quite another for them to vote on the pension status of a convicted former colleague. The board\u2019s rules should require lawmakers to recuse themselves from such votes, not only because it calls into question their personal relationships, but because their decisions set precedents for other potential appellants now in the Legislature. \nUniquely corrupt \nAs if to emphasize how the machinery of state government often serves the politicians at the wheel, state pension rules make a needless distinction between state and federal laws. \nEven though Mellow was charged for employing his state-paid staff for personal political gain and filing a fraudulent tax return, the board found that the federal charge does not have an exact equivalent under state law. The majority then used that point to award Mellow the pension. Therein lies the poor precedent that could enable future federal felons to collect massive state pensions. \nThat\u2019s ridiculous. It means that filing a fraudulent federal tax return isn\u2019t as serious as filing a fraudulent state tax return. The pension system should alter the rule to make a federal corruption conviction sufficient for state pension forfeiture. \nProsecutors should heed decision \nBecause Mellow copped a plea, there was no indictment describing in detail the full scope of the allegations. The federal prosecutors\u2019 presentment was limited to the crimes to which Mellow agreed to plead guilty. \nThis pension ruling should prompt prosecutors to favor indictments or even full trials when dealing with Pennsylvania politicians accused of corruption, thus creating a better record to dissuade the pension board from forgiving and forgetting corrupt acts by public officials. \nAnd being aware of the pension board\u2019s loose stewardship of publicly funded pensions, prosecutors should include pension forfeiture as a condition of plea agreements with state officials admitting to corruption.

The farm puts about 140 female cattle on the market every year, all producing A4 or A5-grade beef that is considered the highest-quality wagyu according to Japan\u2019s grading system. Of these, only four or five cattle a month become Keyakizaka beef. \nOne unique feature of Keyakizaka beef is that the cattle are being fed a mixture of four superfoods, namely quinoa, seaweed, cacao and blueberries. They are also fed only high-quality pure natural water that flows through Akikawa Valley. \nHonda had a vision to produce premium, one-of-a-kind beef to serve exclusively in his restaurant. After searching for the perfect farm and cattle for several years, he traveled to Takeuchi Farm in Akiruno for the first time in April, and was finally able to find the high-quality Akikawa cattle that he believed were ideal to serve at Keyakizaka. Honda, together with Keyakizaka staff, visit Takeuchi Farm a few times a month, nurturing the cattle themselves and enhancing their diet by feeding them superfoods. \nBy collaborating with the local farm, the restaurant is making the best use of locally sourced produce, a dynamic that is becoming increasingly important for the hotel\u2019s discerning guests. This project is just one of many such projects that the hotel is pursuing to embrace sustainable dining. \nOn the dinner menu is the Keyakizaka Beef Course at \u00a526,000, an a la carte tenderloin (120g) at \u00a511,500 and a sirloin dish (150g) at \u00a510,000. All prices exclude tax and service charge. The Grand Hyatt Tokyo is three minutes from Roppongi Station.

The Court held that the Civil Rights act was constitutional because, under the Commerce Clause, Congress has the ability to regulate the interstate flow of goods, services and people. The gist of the holding was that places of public accommodation had no \"right\" to select guests as they saw fit, free from governmental regulation.\nThe Morrison case dealt with civil penalties under the federally enacted Violence Against Women Act. In that case, the Court held that the commerce clause did not grant congress the ability to regulate activity that did not involve interstate commerce (i.e., violence against women in a single state). Rather than leaving this to Congress, the Court said it was up to Virginia to handle assaults that occur in their state.\nMorrison has nothing at all to do with the cake case. The Heart of Atlanta case is more similar, but the cake case centers on religious freedom, which is actually a pretty rare court issue and not part of Heart of Atlanta. I think what happens here is that Kennedy remembers that he was the deciding vote just a few years ago on making gay marriage legal and goes that way.\nOriginally Posted By: StuAzole Originally Posted By: Sharkbiscuit Originally Posted By: StuAzole Originally Posted By: Sharkbiscuit $.02\nI think jbd will turn out being right before the erBB is consigned to the dustbin of history, and anyone rolling their eyes at the claim that he's seen signs to this effect...there's a reason this is coming out of the PacNW.\nWhat?\nI think the baker is going to win, and the gay couple is going to lose, in the Supreme Court, just like Hobby Lobby.\nI think this is coming out of the PacNW because it's a bit more libertarian and not as Evangelical.\nI'm not sure I can see it that way, but Kennedy gave a pretty mixed message during questioning so who knows.\nThe baker will lose, they said.

You can't deny service to certain \"protected classes\" based on that status alone - that was sorta the whole civil rights thing. You can deny service because someone is rude or shirtless, but not because they're black or female or, in this case the argument goes, gay.\nSo following this argument, a bakery owned by Richard Spencer cannot refuse to bake a wedding cake to someone who is black and wants the cake to say \"Yay for Blacks\", as Black is a Protected Class.\nIt can however refuse to bake one if a person belongs to Black Lives Matter and wants the cake to say \"Yay for Black Lives Matter,\" as BLM is not protected.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:10.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d87b6e5830e9aea272dc71ceeb29bb7f4a48dc95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdrlGUsUArq2n3L6K3JEmw5jwIPs9nQVhaEBcEdAL06oEPoDedQebQtTEIABfVKlTjOqvexOPS1BAc1PKqUCUI4wPQl5CJjhFWSiuXs53.SF4FgdtyHIzr0", "site_full": "crosswordcorner.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://crosswordcorner.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "L.A.Times Crossword Corner", "title": "Thursday, December 7th 2017 Mark McClain", "title_full": "Thursday, December 7th 2017 Mark McClain", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d87b6e5830e9aea272dc71ceeb29bb7f4a48dc95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdrlGUsUArq2n3L6K3JEmw5jwIPs9nQVhaEBcEdAL06oEPoDedQebQtTEIABfVKlTjOqvexOPS1BAc1PKqUCUI4wPQl5CJjhFWSiuXs53.SF4FgdtyHIzr0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Steve (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Thursday, December 7th 2017 Mark McClain", "text": "Theme: No, Why? The \"Y\" is dropped from the end of the theme entries and the resulting phrase is clued accordingly. As the hint says:\n\n61A. Make smart remarks ... and a phonetic hint to the answers to starred clues : WISE OFF \n\nAnd the themers:\n\n19A. *Award-winning defense unit? : TOP FORT . Top Forty.\n\n31A. *Manchester hospital hookup? : ENGLISH IV . English Ivy. Hedera Helix, aka common ivy, or simply ivy. This theme entry is interesting as the pre- and post- \"Y\" versions are homophones, and techinically \"IV\" is an abbreviation and not clued as such.\n\n\n38A. *Either of a historic PGA pair? : ARNIE'S ARM . Arnie's Army. Golfer Arnold Palmer's legions of fans were known as \"Arnie's Army\". Notice that the pre- and post- versions of this entry actually refer to the same person.\n\n49A. *Enforcer of greenhouse gas restrictions? : CARBON COP . Carbon Copy. I wonder if carbon paper actually exists any more?\n\nWell, good day to you all. An interesting theme from Mark today. I got ENGLISH IV first, and as I mentioned above I thought that all the themers were going to be homophones, so that put me off track for a couple of minutes. I put myself firther off-track in the north-east corner when I jumped to an IAMS conclusion without waiting for any cross-confirmation, but that was easily fixed.\n\nThe Z was my final fill, and actually a WAG - Both ZESTA and AZERA were unknowns; the alphabet run turned up Z as feeling the most likely, and I guessed right. Phew!\n\nLet's see what else we've got going on:\n\nAcross :\n\n1. Not insignificant : BIG \n\n4. LeBron's hometown : AKRON . Basketball star LeBron James, who famously decamped from Cleveland to Miami to win \"not one, not two, not three ...\" championships. He got his ego under control after a couple of years. He won two championships with Miami, then returned to Cleveland and won his third in one of the best Finals for years against the Golden State Warriors.\n\n9. Pet food brand : ALPO \n\n13. Discontinued iPod model : NANO . I've still got one of these somewhere, it's probably at the bottom of one of my laptop backpack pockets.\n\n14. Saltine brand : ZESTA \n\n15. Action word : VERB \n\n16. Words after an estimate : ORSO \n\n17. Divisions politiques :  \u00c9TATS. I enjoyed seeing the close proximity of ROI in the grid; it reminded me of Louis XIV and his famous statement \"L'etat c'est moi.\"\n\n18. Those, to Pablo : ESOS \n\n21. Sculler's blade : OAR \n\n23. Capri suffix : OTE . A couple of entries filled themselves in for me today, this was one of them. A native of the island of Capri is a Capriote.\n\n24. Trattoria menu suffix : INI . Two suffixes in a row. One would suffix - I mean suffice.\n\n25. Chaucer offering : TALE . The Canterbury Tales. Bane of many a schoolboy's life when read in medieval English.\n\n27. \"Stagecoach,\" for one : OATER \n\n29. Birdcage feature : PERCH.  \n\n34. Multichannel : STEREO . I guess two is \"multi.\" Quadrophonic was all the rage when I was growing up, but if you didn't sit dead center of the four speakers it was rather a waste of time. Great for lonely audiophiles though.\n\n36. Saturn SUV : VUE \n\n37. One of the Nereids : IONE . This was another of the entries that filled itself in for me. There are 50 of these sea-nymphs, daughters of Nereus and Doris. You've got a minute to name them all - GO!\n\n41. Neatnik's opposite : SLOB \n\n44. Pioneering ISP : AOL \n\n45. Warm-weather wear : SHORTS . I wear shorts in most weathers, I've got so used to the California climate. I got some odd looks in England a couple of weeks ago, I guess an overcoat and a pair of shorts is an odd sartorial combination.\n\n52. Three-time Wimbledon champ : EVERT . The great Chris. Her record is quite amazing - she reached the semi-finals or better in 52 of 56 of the Grand Slam tournaments she entered, and she one at least one Slam tournament for 13 consecutive years.\n\n53. Directive : ORDER \n\n54. One of the three bears : PAPA \n\n56. Mai __ : TAI \n\n57. Arctic coast explorer : RAE . Scotsman John Rae. He probably didn't wear shorts - he would have been wearing a kilt.\n\n58. Consume : EAT \n\n63. Mosque figure : IMAM \n\n65. Big name in craft stores : JOANN . This had me foxed for a little while - I knew the store, but I didn't realize the name lacked a final \"E\"\n\n67. Response to being slain, in texts? : ROFL . \"Slain\" in the \"Wow, that's funny\" sense. Rolling On the Floor, Laughing\".\n\n68. Khartoum's river : NILE \n\n69. Match : AGREE \n\n70. \"Would __?\" : I LIE . Usually the answer is \"Yes, through your teeth.\"\n\n71. Notable deed : GEST . Learning moment for me. I know the French \"Geste\", I didn't realize there was an English equivalent, but there it is in the dictionary.\n\n72. Saratoga action : RACES \n\n73. PC panic button : ESC. Escape. It usually doesn't do very much.\n\nDown :\n\n1. British nobleman : BARONET \n\n2. Motivate : INSPIRE \n\n3. Mess (up) : GOOF \n\n4. Korean sedan to be discontinued in the U.S. after 2017 : AZERA \n\n5. Whistling vessel : KETTLE . It took me a loooong time to see this, and it was so obvious when I did.\n\n6. Nation surrounding 10-Down: Abbr. : R.S.A.  The Republic of South Africa.\n.\n7. Director Preminger : OTTO \n\n8. \"Hidden Figures\" org. : NASA \n\n9. \"__ Maria\" : AVE \n\n10. Enclaved African land : LESOTHO.  The beautiful Maletsunyane Falls:\n\n\n11. Tofu nutrient : PROTEIN \n\n12. Watch : OBSERVE \n\n13. Custom on some cruises : NO TIPS . I've never been on a cruise; at least not one where I wasn't sailing the boat myself.\n\n20. Multiple-choice choice : OTHER . I like this one. I was thinking of different letters at first.\n\n22. Louis XIV, par exemple : ROI \n\n26. Wrap around : ENVELOP \n\n28. \"I, Robot\" writer : ASIMOV \n\n30. Champion swimmer/actor Buster : CRABBE . Clarence Linden Crabbe II. He made over a hundred movies and played Flash Gordon in the TV series. However, I'm sure his middle child didn't thank him for the name \"Sande\".\n\n32. Director Van Sant : GUS \n\n33. Where ewes can hang out : LEAS . Meadows, by another name.\n\n35. __ even keel : ON AN \n\n39. Biennial games org. : I.O.C.  The transparently honest and wholly uncorruptable International Olympic Committee.\n\n40. Flightless birds : RHEAS . I always forget these fellas, I get stuck on EMU and go no further.\n\n41. Making a touchdown : SCORING . Except you don't actually have to touch the ball down. The equivalent in rugby is a try, and you do have to touch the ball down, under control, otherwise the try doesn't count.\n\n42. Metro area SSE of Casper : LARAMIE. Wyoming. I've flown over it a ton of times, but never actually been there.\n\n43. Major hassles : ORDEALS \n\n46. Updates the plant : RE-TOOLS . Of course I was on the flora track for the longest time.\n\n47.

The Court held that the Civil Rights act was constitutional because, under the Commerce Clause, Congress has the ability to regulate the interstate flow of goods, services and people. The gist of the holding was that places of public accommodation had no \"right\" to select guests as they saw fit, free from governmental regulation.\nThe Morrison case dealt with civil penalties under the federally enacted Violence Against Women Act. In that case, the Court held that the commerce clause did not grant congress the ability to regulate activity that did not involve interstate commerce (i.e., violence against women in a single state). Rather than leaving this to Congress, the Court said it was up to Virginia to handle assaults that occur in their state.\nMorrison has nothing at all to do with the cake case. The Heart of Atlanta case is more similar, but the cake case centers on religious freedom, which is actually a pretty rare court issue and not part of Heart of Atlanta. I think what happens here is that Kennedy remembers that he was the deciding vote just a few years ago on making gay marriage legal and goes that way.\nOriginally Posted By: StuAzole Originally Posted By: Sharkbiscuit Originally Posted By: StuAzole Originally Posted By: Sharkbiscuit $.02\nI think jbd will turn out being right before the erBB is consigned to the dustbin of history, and anyone rolling their eyes at the claim that he's seen signs to this effect...there's a reason this is coming out of the PacNW.\nWhat?\nI think the baker is going to win, and the gay couple is going to lose, in the Supreme Court, just like Hobby Lobby.\nI think this is coming out of the PacNW because it's a bit more libertarian and not as Evangelical.\nI'm not sure I can see it that way, but Kennedy gave a pretty mixed message during questioning so who knows.\nThe baker will lose, they said.

It's important to note that Kennedy wrote a concurring opinion in Hobby Lobby discussing the governments failure to meet its burden on the accommodation issue when comparing for profit and not-for-profit corporations. His vote was focused on that, not on the larger religious freedom issue, so I don't think he was all that supportive of the matter.\nUltimately, I think the baker will lose because the religious freedom issue is too nebulous. The argument is that cake making is an art, and you can't make an artist create art that doesn't jibe with his religion. Some of the justices asked where that line of thinking ends - is a hairdresser creating art when doing the bride's hair? What about the table suppliers - an artistic endeavor to lay out the tables in just the right way? Can anyone not provide services on this basis? My gut is that Kennedy wants to give the religious freedom thing some support, but his support of the gay marriage issue will override that.\nAs a side note - I'm not sold that they Court will actually decide this issue on the merits at all. They have a long history of handling cases without actually ruling on the issue everyone cares about. If there's a way around this, they'll find it. This NYT article hits on this by suggesting the Court may send it back to the Colorado commission for a rehearing. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/us/politics/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-cake.html\nAs another side note - I previously said I'm just guessing here.

You can't deny service to certain \"protected classes\" based on that status alone - that was sorta the whole civil rights thing. You can deny service because someone is rude or shirtless, but not because they're black or female or, in this case the argument goes, gay.\nSo following this argument, a bakery owned by Richard Spencer cannot refuse to bake a wedding cake to someone who is black and wants the cake to say \"Yay for Blacks\", as Black is a Protected Class.\nIt can however refuse to bake one if a person belongs to Black Lives Matter and wants the cake to say \"Yay for Black Lives Matter,\" as BLM is not protected.\nAre you trying to zing me or something? I didn't write the Civil Rights laws.\nBut no, the argument's not that simple. Is the guy who wants the cake black or white? Is there a reason he won't write \"BLM\" on the cake? Does he have a policy of declining to make cakes of a political nature in general, or is this an arbitrary denial?

Mitochondria are responsible for providing the energy which epigenes use for finding alternative nuclear DNA sequences for coding around defective DNA sequences. Without this extra energy epigenes are forced to code from defective DNA sequences.\nIt's almost that simple, except for one little glitch. Autistic kids tend to have bad allergies, sometimes extremely bad allergies crossing into autoimmune disease. Mitochondria are evolved bacteria. The immune system responds to the DNA of bacteria.

The \u2018Sweet Strawberry Afternoon Tea\u2019 features an array of desserts concocted by Pastry Chef Aa Koswara using fresh strawberries from Gyeongnam Province, South Korea, in collaboration with aT (Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corporation) and Gyeongnam Province. Originated straight from Jinju in Gyeongsangnam-do, South Korea, the Gyeonngnam strawberries are characteristically sweeter and contain less organic acid than your ordinary berries. One of the exported varieties, \u2018Maehyang,\u2019 has a firmer texture than other types that will remain fresh even when shipped long distances. Another distinctive facts explained by the aT (Korea Agro-Fisheries Trade Corporation) , is that Korean strawberries produced in winter are naturally even sweeter as in colder temperature, the plant\u2019s fruit breathes less at night, thus losing less nutrition and making the strawberries bigger and sweeter. In contrast, during the spring season, the growing period is shorter but the fruit also has less time to reduce the amount of organic acid, leading to the sour taste. Bright red berries are transformed into desserts such as strawberry tartlets, crumble cake, cheesecake, to strawberry choux, mille feuille, strawberry pannacotta or enjoyed fresh, there\u2019s no shortage of ways to sample these Korean berries. Not only desserts, an assortment of refreshing strawberry drinks will also be served on Lobby Lounge, Caf\u00e9 Gran Via and El Bombon. These strawberries sensation will exclusively served at Caf\u00e9 Gran Via until December 30 th and El Bombon as well as Lobby Lounge from 4 \u2013 6 December on 3-6 PM, at IDR 178.000+.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA 40-year-old Dover man has been jailed for 24 weeks and banned from a street for five years after terrorising his friends, neighbours, service station staff and police officers. \nAlexander Corbett, formerly of Clarendon Place, has been banned from the street after pleading guilty to 13 offences, including assaults, threatening behaviour, criminal damage and attempted theft. \nIn one incident, the former Director of construction firm Holbrook Griffith, threatened to slit the throats of a mother and her son while he was trying to force his way into their home. \nIn another, while drunk and possibly under the influence of crack cocaine, Corbett beat his friend and broke off a door handle in order to prevent his escaping. Alexander Corbett was sentenced at Folkestone Magistrates' Court after pleading guilty to 13 offences (Image: Kent Police) 'I'm going to slit your throats' \nOn July 23 this year around 7pm, Corbett began banging on the front door of Claire Portanier, who was at home with her son Connor, demanding to be let inside and attempting to gain entry. \nWhen Connor asked him to stop, Corbett said: \"I am going to kill you, I am going to slit your throats.\" \nCorbett, who has previous convictions for, battery, knife possession and common assault, left the scene but was later found at his home by police. Read More \nWhen found, he began acting in an aggressive manner towards the officers and was only subdued when one of them pulled out a taser and threatened to use it on him. \nThe court heard a statement from Ms Portanier detailing the effect the ordeal had had on her. \nShe said: \u201cI have since been living in fear of Mr Corbett. The case was heard at Folkestone Magistrates' Court \n\u201cI panic at the thought of leaving the house on a daily basis. I am not sleeping at night. \n\u201cI want to be safe and for Mr Corbett to leave me and my family alone.\u201d False imprisonment \nTwo days previous to this incident, Corbett attacked a former colleague of his who had dropped by Corbett\u2019s home to return his tools. \nAn independent witness said Corbett punched Mr Town three times in the head, causing him to suffer a bloody nose. \nOn November 2, Corbett called his friend Jon Comerford, telling him to come to his home. \nMr Comerford, knowing that Corbett was going through \u2018hard times\u2019 and having troubles with alcohol, showed up to the address. Corbett has been banned from going to Clarendon Place for five years (Image: Google Maps) \nWhile there Mr Comerford made a remark which Corbett took offence to and he began beating him, punching and kicking him ten to fifteen times. \nWhen Mr Comerford tried to leave, Corbett broke off the inside door handle, punched his friend and banged his head against the door, leaving him with a lump to the back of his head. \nMr Comerford said he was going to go to the police to which Corbett responded that if he did, he and ten of his friends would show up at Mr Comerford\u2019s house. \nMr Comerford managed to call the police to say he was being held against his will. Tasered \nFollowing the assault, numerous neighbours came out of their houses and Corbett became verbally abusive, and made a homophobic remark towards one woman, Lorraine Reid. \nWhen police arrived officers arrived, he unleashed a torrent of profanity and refused to open the door. \nLeft with no choice but to force entry, the police made their way into Corbett\u2019s house at which point he began attacking them, kicking two of them and causing an injury to the finger of one. \nComerton was eventually subdued after being tasered and restrained.

Did you make a mistake saying you had a \"CHL\" but didn't bother telling us that the state has revoked that?\nIf it were me who posted this ad and I messed up, I would have correct the ad, or contact a moderator and ask for the ad to be deleted so I could put up the correct ad that accurately portrays me. By arguing with people and by calling them out because you made a so called \"typo\", which its not, but rather a word you omitted. It just tells people who are out there that you may cause issues on a future lease and they'll most likely pass on you.\nAgain the longer you drag out this post, the more and more it makes you look bad.

But now Careaux is here to change that.\u201d \nWhen her idea became reality, her sister, Laura, aged 29 decided to get onboard. \nShe said: \"I also have Cystic Fibrosis, and I have been in hospital quite a lot over the past couple of years. I did some primary school tuition with the The Tutor Trust, which I am still a part of. But starting this business, with the support from Rachel, gives me the flexibility to work from home and do work from hospital if needs be.\" \nThe Careaux dress has a zip around the waist that enables the garment to separate into a top and a skirt, or be worn as a dress. This enables the dress to have a different or same size top and bottom, and allows to interchange the tops (sleeveless and \u00be sleeved), and the skirts (pencil and skater) to create up to four different dress styles. \nLaura said: \"The Careaux Black Dress truly adapts to the wearer\u2019s unique shape, size and style. When customers buy online they will choose their top and bottom size and style along with their waist size. This is to solve the issue that most women are a different size top to bottom and look for versatility combined with timeless style.\u201d \nRachel Riley, TV presenter and mathematician has commented on the duos idea. She said: \u201cI love Rachel and Laura's passion for Maths and fashion which they've used to reinvent the little black dress in such a clever way. For any woman with a top half bigger or smaller than their bottom, their idea solves the ill-fitting dress problem in a stylish and comfortable way - well done girls!\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura beattie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "careaux", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel riley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "careaux black dress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loreto grammar school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "stretford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "altrincham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:12.004+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15124637, "moreResultsAvailable": 15124537, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512639132004&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 666}
