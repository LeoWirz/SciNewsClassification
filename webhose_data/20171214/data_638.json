Demonstrating EU leadership these voluntary commitments cover new policy initiatives on plastics and pharmaceuticals in water, measures to tackle marine litter and air pollution, as well as funding initiatives that invest in measures to tackle pollution in Europe and beyond, the Commission said in a press release. This is backed up by a proposal for a resolution from the EU and its Member States on environment and health covering the management of chemicals and waste, climate, biodiversity, antimicrobial resistance, and sustainable consumption and production.\nSpeaking at UNEA3 side event on circular economy in Nairobi, Vella reminded that \u201cEurope has come a long way with the circular economy\u201d.\nThe event, opened by Vella and closed by the Estonian Presidency, with the participation of Environment Ministers from China, Chile and South Africa, stived to contribute to frame global action on sustainable consumption and production, exploring how a circular economy can address resource constraints and generate economic opportunities.\n\u201cToday isn\u2019t about Europe, of course, we\u2019re looking at the global scale. Making the global economy more circular can seem a little daunting. There are so many elements that need to change. The answer I think is to follow the example of our climate colleagues. We need to segment the task, break it into manageable challenges. We keep one eye on the big picture, but we get there by effective action in particular segments,\u201d the Environment Commissioner said.\n\u201cAnd the segment I want to talk about today is plastics. They\u2019ve often been the backbone of the linear economy. And because they are so convenient, they aren\u2019t just going to disappear. But we can rethink them. We can find ways of keeping those advantages, while minimising the harm they do. And if we make them more circular, we can actually tackle three SDGs at the same time. We can move toward more sustainable production and consumption, we can tackle marine litter, and if we change our manufacturing processes and remove substances of concern, then we can also protect human health,\u201d Vella said.\n\u201cThis is an area where the European Commission has been working very hard. Our Action Plan for the Circular Economy made plastics a priority, so it\u2019s something that we are preparing very carefully. The result will be a new strategy for plastics, which I want to be exemplary, and an inspiration for economies around the world,\u201d he said, adding that there are two very basic aims.\n\u201cThe first is to put this linear approach behind us. To make it not just desirable, but normal and financially advantageous to recycle plastics,\u201d Vella said. \u201cWe can do that by improving the economics and the quality of plastic recycling \u2013 being more careful about what goes into plastics in the first place, and by ensuring that there are real incentives to use plastic recyclate,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThe second aim is to cut plastic waste and littering. We\u2019ve all seen the deeply worrying news about plastic waste polluting the most remote corners of our planet, and I sense a profound social change on this matter just around the corner.

According to the company\u2019s figures, the average deposit needed for first-time buyers in Glasgow is \u00a321,876; in Edinburgh it is \u00a337,661; and in London it is a staggering \u00a3139,987. Even in a country used to rising house prices, those are pretty extraordinary figures. \nBut it gets worse. Despite everything we should have learned from the credit crunch \u2013 which was caused in a large part by an out-of-control housing market \u2013 deposits are going to carry on rising. The projection by L&C Mortgages is that within ten years, first-time buyers will need to raise almost \u00a360,000 if they are in Edinburgh and in London the figure will have risen to \u00a3244, 842. A quarter of a million pounds and that\u2019s just the deposit. \nOne of the main reasons we ended up here is our obsession with home ownership over other options. In the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher fed the obsession by introducing right-to-buy which reduced the stock of social housing. Private rental, which is typically short-term, is also a poor alternative for many people, particularly families with children. And with low interest rates, the cost of a mortgage still compares favourably to long-term rent. \n \nBut, with house prices continuing to rise, how are first-time buyers expected to be part of this so-called home-owning revolution? Saving for a large deposit is extremely hard if not impossible for most people, particularly with interest rates low and wages stagnating. Some people will rely on their parents, but not everyone has a mum and dad that can afford to help. \nThe over-heated nature of the market also makes it hard for first-time buyers. Typically, a house will be advertised as \u201coffers over\u201d which means that, not only does a first-time buyer have to raise the deposit, they have to pay a large amount over the asking price. It is hard to see how first-time buyers get anywhere at all, particularly in a market like Edinburgh\u2019s. \nUndoubtedly, the Help to Buy scheme has made a bit of a difference. The Scottish Government should also look at copying the UK Government\u2019s move to exempt first-time buyers south of the border from stamp duty on the first \u00a3300,000 of the purchase price. The First Minister says a tax break on purchases up to \u00a3175,000 would be enough, given lower house prices in Scotland , but perhaps Ms Sturgeon should look again at some of the prices of houses in the country\u2019s hot spots. \nA big increase in the number of affordable houses would also help. The Scottish Government says it will deliver at least 50,000 affordable homes by 2021, but there must be questions over whether that is achievable. Where will the land come from, and where will the money come from? The hope must be that more homes would make life easier, but even 50,000 isn\u2019t going to change the economic fundamentals. Sadly, for first-time buyers, they are still stacked high against them.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "margaret thatcher", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "l&c mortgages", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:45.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a1ddebc49ca44673ab2d4813558fe0796127bc7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYur4.fj0T3nc1HzaWvMvCAPVD1pZupXm67Y960DNwOF0k8Lat.sQfIxx9of6GSnD8jI1qO5oXwaQ8eumrIjqoCN", "site_full": "jobsitesinnigeria.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://jobsitesinnigeria.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Job Sites in Nigeria: List of Avalible current jobs in Nigeria", "title": "Chief Policy Economist at the African Development Bank (AfDB), Thursday 7, December 2017", "title_full": "Chief Policy Economist at the African Development Bank (AfDB), Thursday 7, December 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T20:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a1ddebc49ca44673ab2d4813558fe0796127bc7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYur4.fj0T3nc1HzaWvMvCAPVD1pZupXm67Y960DNwOF0k8Lat.sQfIxx9of6GSnD8jI1qO5oXwaQ8eumrIjqoCN", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Riche (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T20:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Chief Policy Economist at the African Development Bank (AfDB), Thursday 7, December 2017", "text": "African Development Bank (AfDB) \u2013 Established in 1964, the African Development Bank is the premier pan-African development institution, promoting economic growth and social progress across the continent.

Klaus Heitlinger\u00b9   Fruchtsaft & Co. als ideale Begleiter zum Weihnachtsmen\u00fc Bonn, 7. Dezember 2017 - Kaum ein anderes Getr\u00e4nk kann so viele Bed\u00fcrfnisse und Verzehrsanl\u00e4sse bedienen wie Fruchtsaft. Und so bieten sich S\u00e4fte auch beim Trendthema \"Food Pairing\" als ideale Partner an. Beim Food Pairing werden Aromen kombiniert, die zun\u00e4chst nicht vermuten lassen, dass sie gemeinsam ein harmonisches Ganzes ergeben. Fruchtsaft & Co. in Kombination mit Tonic Water oder schwarzem Tee, mit Kr\u00e4utern, Gew\u00fcrzen oder \u00d6len bieten ganz neue Geschmacksalternativen. Diese Kombinationen eigenen sich hervorragend als alkoholfreie Speisebegleiter, auch als Alternative zum klassischen Wein im Rahmen des Weihnachtsmen\u00fcs. Dabei muss man nur wissen, was wozu passt und welche Aromen miteinander harmonieren. Grunds\u00e4tzlich sind der Fantasie aber keine Grenzen gesetzt und schlu\u00dfendlich entscheidet immer der eigene Geschmack. Fruchtsaft f\u00fcr neue Geschmackserlebnisse Fruchts\u00e4fte und -nektare k\u00f6nnen dank ihrer Sorten- und Geschmacksvielfalt ganz unterschiedliche Geschm\u00e4cker bedienen. Ob herb-s\u00e4uerlich, klar und spritzig oder samtig-s\u00fc\u00df, es gibt immer das passende Produkt. Das moderne Food Pairing geht heute \u00fcber die Berechnung von passenden Schl\u00fcsselaromen hinaus. Um die Kombinationen perfekt zu machen, kommt es auch auf Texturen, Konsistenzen und Aggregatzust\u00e4nde an. Fruchts\u00e4fte und -nektare verf\u00fcgen hier von Haus aus \u00fcber verschiedene Varianten, sei es ein klarer Kirschnektar, ein Orangensaft mit Fruchtfleisch oder ein samtiger Aprikosennektar. Ein Saft oder Nektar bietet sich auch ideal als Granita an oder sorgt \u00fcber das Fermentieren f\u00fcr ein ganz neues Geschmackserlebnis. Fermentation beruht auf dem Prinzip, dass der Pilz in einer N\u00e4hrl\u00f6sung wie Tee oder einem Aufguss liegt und von dem zugegeben Zucker lebt. Verwendet man Fruchs\u00e4fte, reduziert dies nicht nur die Menge des beizugebenden Zuckers, sondern sorgt durch die Fermentation f\u00fcr v\u00f6llig neue Geschmackserlebnisse. Es muss auch nicht immer das Getr\u00e4nk sein. Fruchts\u00e4fte begleiten das Men\u00fc auch in Dressings, Saucen oder Dips. So passen Sauerkirsche und Johannisbeere gut zu Fleisch- und Wildgerichten, w\u00e4hrend die Ananas Currys eine besondere Note verleiht und ein Orangensaft dem Salat den Frischekick gibt. Unsere Food Pairing-Ideen f\u00fcr Weihnachten Rhabarber-Loorbeer-Drink 330 ml Apfelsaft naturtr\u00fcb, 330 ml Rhabarbernektar, 350 ml kochendes Wasser, 5 getrocknete Lorbeerbl\u00e4tter Zubereitung: Lorbeerbl\u00e4tter grob brechen, mit dem kochenden Wasser aufgie\u00dfen und 15 Minuten ziehen lassen.

Er passt zu Ofenkartoffeln, Couscoussalat und Flammkuchen, harmoniert mit milden Frischk\u00e4sen, wei\u00dfem Fischfilet oder Omeletts. Er l\u00e4sst sich aber auch zu m\u00fcrbem Apfelkuchen, Waffeln oder gebackenen Apfelspalten trinken.

Enjoy over 50 brain games that challenge your core cognitive abilities! Save 35% today. Get Premium - Save 35% Lumosity scientists constantly seek to understand more about brain training and human cognitive abilities. To accelerate this effort, we've created the Human Cognition Project, a collaboration between our scientists and researchers from over 60 universities around the world. HCP collaborators are academic scientists, researchers, clinicians, and educators. After reviewing research proposals, the Lumosity science team may grant applicants free access to Lumosity's tools and, in certain cases, limited access to select anonymized portions of Lumosity's database of cognitive game performance. Collaborators are then able to use these resources in experiments of their own design. This approach has contributed to the considerable breadth of topics represented in ongoing HCP collaborations, including studies on normal aging, certain medical conditions, and the relationship between physical exercise and Lumosity training.The HCP is, in many ways, Lumosity's greatest research asset, allowing in-house scientists to learn from the collective expertise of many minds. And the more we learn, the better we hope to make Lumosity training. The realm of cognitive training is a relatively new one, which also makes it a fresh and exhilarating place to do research that expands the boundaries of what is known.

They want to know what burned the fog away: stars, supermassive black holes, or both in tandem? And how did those behemoth black holes grow so big in so little time?\nNow the discovery of a supermassive black hole smack in the middle of this period is helping astronomers resolve both questions. \u0093It\u0092s a dream come true that all of these data are coming along,\u0094 said Avi Loeb, the chair of the astronomy department at Harvard University.\nThe black hole, announced today in the journal Nature, is the most distant ever found. It dates back to 690 million years after the Big Bang. Analysis of this object reveals that reionization, the process that defogged the universe like a hair dryer on a steamy bathroom mirror, was about half complete at that time. The researchers also show that the black hole already weighed a hard-to-explain 780 million times the mass of the sun.\nA team led by Eduardo Ba\u00f1ados, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Pasadena, found the new black hole by searching through old data for objects with the right color to be ultradistant quasars \u0097 the visible signatures of supermassive black holes swallowing gas. The team went through a preliminary list of candidates, observing each in turn with a powerful telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. On March 9, Ba\u00f1ados observed a faint dot in the southern sky for just 10 minutes. A glance at the raw, unprocessed data confirmed it was a quasar \u0097 not a nearer object masquerading as one \u0097 and that it was perhaps the oldest ever found. \u0093That night I couldn\u0092t even sleep,\u0094 he said.

Against the dollar it has gone from $1.45 to $1.34. \nBritain is the biggest export market by unit sales and the second-biggest in financial terms for German automakers, as they operate relatively few local factories in the island nation. \n\u201cWe hope that the United Kingdom remains in a European market alliance, the current debate, the \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 line among conservatives, is not right for us or for the British market,\u201d Wissmann said. \nLondon politicians are divided across party lines over whether Britain should remain closely aligned with EU regulations to preserve the maximum possible amount of trade with its closest neighbours or diverge sharply to seek advantage with partners further afield. \n\u201cWe are preparing for enormous bureaucratic complications\u201d when Britain finally does leave the bloc, Wissmann added. 2017-12-07", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthias wissmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wissmann", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vda", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:01:48.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6e71926eb0529393b5d7b71706842bcfb149255", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoao6Hac_ZkU.n1tntklUXUMkHL39GP8szbLhoW2xE61lrz9q5GOGdl0bKIg7pYBObU2yWesLVg3l8JSpiKrpKluylmKGusggd59nxYb9JaS9CIj2QaOxlh", "site_full": "statusandshayariinhindi.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://statusandshayariinhindi.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Best Quotes and Shayari", "title": "The wave of evil....Ralph Waldo Emerson Quotes...", "title_full": "The wave of evil....Ralph Waldo Emerson Quotes...", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a6e71926eb0529393b5d7b71706842bcfb149255", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoao6Hac_ZkU.n1tntklUXUMkHL39GP8szbLhoW2xE61lrz9q5GOGdl0bKIg7pYBObU2yWesLVg3l8JSpiKrpKluylmKGusggd59nxYb9JaS9CIj2QaOxlh", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Best quote and shayari (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "The wave of evil....Ralph Waldo Emerson Quotes...", "text": "The wave of evil washes all our institutions alike.

Abstract \nThe crude acetone extract (CAE) of defatted inflorescences of Tagetes patula was partitioned into five semipurified fractions: n -hexane (HF), dichloromethane (DF), ethyl acetate (EAF), n -butanol (BF), and aqueous (AQF). BF was fractionated by reversed-phase polyamide column chromatography, obtaining 34 subfractions, which were subjected to HSCCC, where patuletin and patulitrin were isolated. CAE and the fractions BF, EAF, DF, and AQF were analyzed by LC-DAD-MS, and patuletin and patulitrin were determined as the major substances in EAF and BF, respectively. BF was also analyzed by HPLC and capillary electrophoresis (CE), and patulitrin was again determined to be the main substance in this fraction. CAE and the semipurified fractions (750, 500, 300, 100, and 50\u2009mg/L) were assayed for larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti , with mortality rate expressed as percentage. All fractions except AQF showed insecticidal activity after 24\u2009h exposure of larvae to the highest concentration. However, EAF showed the highest activity with more than 50% reduction in larval population at 50\u2009mg/L. The insecticidal activity observed with EAF might have been due to the higher concentration of patuletin present in this fraction. 1. Introduction \nAedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) is an anthropophilic and domicile mosquito, and it is the main vector for dengue viruses in the Americas. This mosquito puts half of the world\u2019s population at risk with a 30-fold increase in incidence in the past 50 years in more than 100 endemic countries [ 1 , 2 ]. According to data from the World Health Organization, the number of people affected with dengue in 2015 was 3.2 million, with 500,000 people hospitalized per year [ 3 ]. \nAe. aegypti also carries chikungunya, zika, and yellow fever urban viruses; so its monitoring and control are necessary. Vector control in Brazil currently occurs with the use of growth regulators of immature stages, such as diflubenzuron, and the control of adult mosquitoes with alpha-cypermethrin, deltamethrin, malathion, and others according to recommendations of the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme [ 4 ], which are nonspecific products that select resistant insects due to their great genetic plasticity [ 5 ], with consequent environmental contamination [ 6 ]. \nThere is currently a great deal of interest in alternative methods and selective principles for the control of mosquitoes with less environmental damage [ 7 ]. In this sense, substances extracted from plants present a great perspective for the control of Ae. aegypti . \nThe substances of natural origin have some advantages: they are obtained from renewable resources, and the selection of resistant forms occurs at a slower rate than with synthetic insecticides [ 8 , 9 ]. Another advantage is that they show low or no toxicity to mammals and bees [ 10 ]. \nAmong the plants with bioactive substances, there is Tagetes patula L., popularly known as \u201ccravo-franc\u00eas,\u201d \u201ccravo-de-defunto,\u201d or \u201cbot\u00f5es-de-solteir\u00e3o\u201d [ 11 ]. T. patula belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is one of the oldest groups of higher plants [ 12 ], with approximately 300 genera and 3000 species in Brazil [ 13 ], and its flavonoids patuletin and patulitrin are considered important taxonomic markers [ 14 ]. \nIts inflorescences have been used in folk medicine for antiseptic, diuretic, blood purifying, and insect repellent purposes. Its leaves have been used for renal problems and muscle pain and its roots and seeds used as purgatives [ 15 ]. Some studies on the chemical composition of T. patula up to now indicate that the flowers and leaves are rich in terpenes [ 16 , 17 ], alkaloids [ 18 ], thiophenes [ 19 ], and flavonoids [ 20 \u2013 22 ]. This plant has shown the following activities: antihypertensive [ 23 ], anti-inflammatory [ 14 ], hepatoprotective [ 24 ], insecticidal [ 25 ], nematicidal [ 26 , 27 ], larvicidal [ 19 ], antibacterial [ 17 ], antiviral [ 28 ], and antifungal [ 29 ]. \nAccordingly, the aim of this work was to isolate and identify compounds from the semipurified n -butanol fraction of T. patula by reversed-phase column chromatography and high-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC) and to evaluate the chemical profile of the crude extract and semipurified fractions using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), capillary electrophoresis (CE), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-MS). In addition, the larvicidal activity of the crude extract and semipurified fractions was evaluated against Ae. aegypti . 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Plant Material \nThe inflorescences of T. patula were collected in November 2011 in the Garden of Medicinal Plants of the Universidade Estadual de Londrina, Londrina, Brazil, where they were organically grown. The plant material was collected under a permit from IBAMA-SISBIO, number 11995-6, May 13, 2016, authentication code 48926652, under the responsibility of J. C. P. Mello. An exsiccate is deposited at the Herbarium of the Universidade Estadual de Maring\u00e1 (HUEM) under number 21907, and the identification was provided by Professor Dr. Jimi Nakajima at the Institute of Biology of the Universidade Federal de Uberl\u00e2ndia, Uberl\u00e2ndia, Brazil. The flowers were dried in a convection oven at 38\u00b0C for 48\u2009h. The dried plant material was macerated using a hammer mill (Tigre ASN-5). 2.2. Preparation of Crude Extract and Semipurified Fractions \nThe milled inflorescences (1.9\u2009kg) were defatted with n -hexane by dynamic maceration for three days, with subsequent drying of the inflorescences at room temperature. Afterwards, acetone was used as extraction solvent at a proportion of 4% (w/v) in an Ultra-Turrax\u00ae (UTC115KT, Ika Works) for 5\u2009min and then subjected to maceration for 15\u2009h. Next, turbo-extraction was performed for 20\u2009min, with intervals of 5\u2009min ( \u00b0C). The extract was filtered, concentrated under reduced pressure, frozen, and lyophilized (Alpha 1\u20134, Christ\u00ae) to give the crude acetone extract (CAE, 5.86%). CAE was fractionated according to Filho and Yunes [ 30 ]. Briefly, 105\u2009g CAE was resuspended in 1\u2009L of methanol\u2009:\u2009water (2\u2009:\u20098, v/v) and partitioned with different solvent volume ratios. The yields were n -hexane (HF) 19.27%, dichloromethane (DF) 10.17%, ethyl acetate (EAF) 13.38%, n -butanol (BF) 36.59%, and aqueous (AQF) 15.02%. 2.3. Reversed-Phase Column Chromatography of n -Butanol Fraction \nBF (20.0\u2009g) was separated by column chromatography (CC) with a polyamide column (CC6 Korngrobe, 0.05\u20130.16\u2009mm; Macherey Nagel) according to Degani et al. [ 31 ], and the mobile phase was 100% methanol or water or a combination thereof, providing 34 subfractions (BF#1\u201334). The subfractions BF#6 (25\u2009mg) and BF#11 (5\u2009mg) precipitated during the organic solvent removal process and were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), MS, and HPLC. 2.4. High-Speed Countercurrent Chromatography (HSCCC) \nThe subfractions BF#16, BF#23, and BF#26 were rechromatographed by HSCCC using a PC Ito\u00ae chromatograph (model 001) equipped with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) column (2.5\u2009mm i.d., total volume capacity of 320\u2009mL), 10- \u03bc L sample loop, 800\u2009rpm, and double piston solvent pump (Waters model 510), using a flow-rate of 1.0\u2009mL/min. The organic phase (hexane\u2009:\u2009ethyl acetate\u2009:\u2009methanol\u2009:\u2009water; Table 1 ) was used as the mobile phase, and water was the stationary phase. Only in HSCCC of BF#16 was a gradient system with n -butanol also used. BF#16, BF#23, and BF#26 yielded 8, 15, and 18 subfractions, respectively. The subfractions BF#16.5 (7\u2009mg), BF#23.4 (13\u2009mg), BF#26.6 (4.5\u2009mg), and BF#26.15 (5\u2009mg) were selected and analyzed by NMR and MS. Table 1: Eluent systems used for HSCCC to obtain subfractions. 2.5. NMR Analysis \nThe subfractions BF#6, BF#11, BF#16.5, BF#23.4, BF#26.6, and BF#26.15 were analyzed by NMR spectroscopic methods 1D ( 1 H and 13 C) and 2D ( 1 H/ 1 H-COSY and HMBC), with a Varian Mercury Plus 300 (75\u2009MHz for 13 C and 300\u2009MHz for 1 H), using deuterated solvents and TMS as internal reference. The spectra of the subfractions were related to the compounds Tp1 (BF#23.4, #26.6, and #26.15) and Tp2 (BF#6, #11, and #16.5), which were analyzed and compared to literature data. \nPatuletin ( Tp1 ) H-NMR ( , 300\u2009MHz) . 6.48 (H-8), 7.72 (d, J 2.0\u2009Hz, H-2\u2032), 6.88 (d, J 8.08\u2009Hz, H-5\u2032), 7.63 (dd, J 8.6\u2009Hz; 2.0\u2009Hz, H-6\u2032), 3.88 (OCH 3 -6). 13 C-NMR (CD 3 OD, 75\u2009MHz): 146.9 (C-2), 135.6 (C-3), 176.2 (C-4), 151.6 (C-5), 130.8 (C-6), 157.1 (C-7), 93.4 (C-8), 152.3 (C-9), 103.5 (C-10), 120.3 (C-1\u2032), 114.6 (C-2\u2032), 144.8 (C-3\u2032), 147.4 (C-4\u2032), 114.8 (C-5\u2032), 122.8 (C-6\u2032), 59.60 (CH3-6). \nPatulitrin ( Tp2 ) H-NMR ( , 300\u2009MHz) . 6.93 (s) (H-8), 7.72 (d, J 2.2\u2009Hz, H-2\u2032), 6.89 (d, J 8.5\u2009Hz, H-5\u2032), 7.54 (dd, J 8.5\u2009Hz; 2.1\u2009Hz, H-6\u2032), 5.13 (d; J 7.2, H-1\u2032\u2032), 3.32 (d; J 2,2, H-2\u2032\u2032) 3.45 (m) (H-3\u2032\u2032), 3.17 (m) (H-4\u2032\u2032), 3.48 (m) (H-5\u2032\u2032), 3.72 (m) (H-6\u2032\u2032), 3.78 (s) CH 3 O-6. 13 C-NMR (CD 3 OD, 75\u2009MHz): 147.9 (C-2), 135.8 (C-3), 176.2 (C-4), 151.1 (C-5), 131.8 (C-6), 156.4 (C-7), 93.8 (C-8), 151.4 (C-9), 105.0 (C-10), 120.0 (C-1\u2032), 115.5 (C-2\u2032), 145.0 (C3\u2032), 147.7 (C-4\u2032), 115.4 (C-5\u2032), 121.8 (C-6\u2032), 100.1 (C-1\u2032\u2032), 73.2 (C-2\u2032\u2032), 77.2 (C-3\u2032\u2032), 69.5 (C-4\u2032\u2032), 76.7 (C-5\u2032\u2032), 60.6 (C-6\u2032\u2032), 60.3 (CH 3 O-6). 2.6. HPLC-ESI-MS/MS Analysis \nFractions and subfractions were analyzed with a Waters HPLC system coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Quattro micro\u2122 API) equipped with a Z-electrospray ionization (ESI) source (Waters) and processed by MassLynx\u2122 software (version 4.0, Waters). Chromatographic conditions were as follows: column was a Symmetry C-18 (3.5\u2009 \u03bc m, 75 \u00d7 4.6\u2009mm, Waters); mobile phase was water with 0.1% formic acid (v/v) (solvent A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (v/v) (solvent B). The gradient system employed was as follows: 0\u20132\u2009min 5% B; 10\u2009min 50% B; 2\u2009min 50%; and 13\u201315\u2009min 5% B. The flow rate was 0.5\u2009mL/min and the injection volume 10\u2009 \u03bc L. A sample containing 1000\u2009ng/mL of the isolated substances was injected, and identification was performed analyzing the information of the product ion spectra in comparison to a previously published dataset. 2.7. Identification of the Constituents by LC-DAD-MS \nThe analyses of CAE and the fractions DF, EAF, BF, and AQF were performed on UFLC Shimadzu Prominence chromatograph coupled to a diode array detector (DAD) and MicrOTOF-Q III mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). A Kinetex C-18 chromatographic column (2.6\u2009 \u03bc m, 150 \u00d7 2.1\u2009mm, Phenomenex) was used. Acetonitrile (solvent B) and deionized water (solvent A), both with 0.1% formic acid (v/v), were used as mobile phase. The gradient elution profile was the following: initial 3% B, 2\u201325\u2009min 25% B, 25\u201340\u2009min 80% B, and 40\u201343\u2009min 80% B. The negative and positive ion modes were carried out, and nitrogen was applied as a nebulizer gas (4 bar) and dry gas (9\u2009L/min). 2.8. Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) \nCE for BF analysis was carried out using a Beckman P/ACE\u2122 MDQ electrophoresis system equipped with a filter-based UV/Vis detector and 32 Karat\u2122 version 7.0 software. The column used was a fused silica capillary column (Beckman-Coulter) with dimensions of 60.2\u2009cm total length, 50.0\u2009cm effective length, 363\u2009 \u03bc m o.d., and 75\u2009 \u03bc m i.d. The sample was injected hydrodynamically at 0.5\u2009psi for 3\u2009s, 30\u2009kV, and the electropherogram was recorded at 214\u2009nm. The cartridge coolant of the CE was set with a thermostat at 25\u00b0C. The background electrolyte consisted of 80\u2009mmol/L borate buffer (pH 8.80) containing 10\u2009mmol/L methyl- \u03b2 -cyclodextrin (Me- \u03b2 -CD). The sample solution (500\u2009 \u03bc g/mL) was prepared by dissolving 5\u2009mg BF in 10\u2009mL of 20% methanol and was eluted through the solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge (Strata C18-E, Phenomenex), preconditioned with methanol and water. Tp1 and Tp2 were used as standards for peak identification. All solutions were filtered with 0.45\u2009 \u03bc m Millipore filters. 2.9. Evaluation of Larvicidal Activity \nCAE, AQF, EAF, HF, BF, DF, and the fatty waste obtained in the preparation of the crude extract were tested for larvicidal activity. \nImmature forms of Ae. aegypti were obtained from the insectary of the Malaria and Dengue Laboratory, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amaz\u00f4nia (INPA), Manaus, Brazil. The insectary began with the collection of eggs in the field by using traps (egg traps). All the procedures for the maintenance of mosquitoes and the use of animals for blood meal were authorized by the Animal Experiment Ethics Committee (CEUA/INPA 04/2013). The bioassay methods were according to Lacey [ 32 ], and WHO [ 33 , 34 ], with modifications. \nFourth instar larvae were used for all experiments. Three replicates with 15 immature forms and 50\u2009mL of distilled water per container were assayed. The crude extract and semipurified fractions were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at an initial concentration of 30,000\u2009mg/L in a total volume of 10\u2009mL. The samples were solubilized using an ultrasonic bath for 15\u2009min. To determine mortality rates in percent, lethal concentrations (LC 50 and LC 90 ), and their limits, five concentrations were used: 750, 500, 300, 100, and 50\u2009mg/L. DMSO solution at 300\u2009mg/L and distilled water were used as controls. The assay was performed using a photoperiod of 12/12\u2009h, at \u00b0C. Mortality readings were performed at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120\u2009h. \nStatistical package Spss Inc. 2005 was used for the calculation of the survival curve of the fractions and the lethal time of Ae. aegypti for EAF. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Structural Analysis \nThe structural analysis of subfractions BF#6, BF#11, BF#16.5, BF#23.4, BF#26.6, and BF#26.15 was performed by NMR, HPLC-IES-MS/MS and LC-DAD-MS and resulted in the identification of the compounds Tp1 and Tp2 . \nTp1 (BF#23.4, BF#26.6, and BF#26.15) was obtained as a yellow powder. The mass spectrum obtained by ESI showed an intense ion peak at 333, corresponding to the protonated ion and fragment ions of 288 and 318. The UV spectrum of Tp1 revealed two absorption maxima in the region of 257\u2009nm (band I) and 372\u2009nm (band II), compatible with the UV spectrum of flavonols. \nTp2 (BF#6, BF#11, and BF#16.5) was also obtained as a yellow powder. Its mass spectrum showed an intense ion of 495 and fragment ions at 318 and 333. The UV spectrum of Tp2 revealed maxima at 258\u2009nm (band I) and 371 (band II), which was also compatible with flavonols. \nOn the basis of 1 H and 13 C-NMR data obtained and comparison with literature values [ 35 \u2013 37 ], Tp1 and Tp2 were identified as the flavonols patuletin and patuletin-7- O - \u03b2 -glycoside (patulitrin), respectively, which was confirmed by HMBC, HSQC, and COSY data. \nCAE and AQF, EAF, DF, and BF from T. patula were analyzed by LC-DAD-MS, and the compounds were identified on the basis of UV and accurate mass and fragmentation data, which were compared with the literature data. From the samples, eleven compounds were detected and identified (Figure 1 , Table 2 ). The higher peak intensity was compound 4 (patulitrin) for BF and AQF, compounds 4, 5 (patulitrin isomer), and 8 (patuletin) for EAF, compound 8 for DF, and compounds 4 and 8 for CAE (Figure 1 ). Table 2: Identification of the constituents from Tagetes patula by LC-DAD-MS. Figure 1: Chromatogram at 240 to 350\u2009nm of the crude acetone extract of Tagetes patula (a) and its fractions obtained with dichloromethane (b), ethyl acetate (c), n -butanol (d), and water (e). The identification of the constituents is given in Table 2 . 3.2. CE Fingerprint of BF of T. patula \nIn this work, BF of T. patula was evaluated by CE. The major peaks were identified by addition of the isolated substances of this work. Peak 1 was identified as Tp2 and peak 2 as Tp1 (Figure 2 ). This fingerprint shows that the major substance was Tp2 , and the same profile was observed by LC-DAD-MS analysis (Figure 1 ). Figure 2: CE-UV electropherogram of the n -butanol fraction of Tagetes patula . Experimental conditions: 80\u2009mmol/L borate buffer at pH 8.80 with 10\u2009mmol/L Me- \u03b2 -CD; uncoated fused-silica capillary column, 60.2\u2009cm (50\u2009cm effective length) \u00d7 75\u2009 \u03bc m i.d.; 30\u2009kV; 25\u00b0C; hydrodynamic injection 0.5\u2009psi \u00d7 5\u2009s; detection at 214\u2009nm; BF: 500\u2009 \u03bc g/mL. Peaks: (1)\u2009\u2009Tp2 (patulitrin);\u2009 (2) Tp1 (patuletin). \nSome studies with T. patula have been performed using thin layer chromatography (TLC), HPLC, and HPLC-MS [ 19 , 38 ]. However, CE was employed here for the first time to identify the compounds obtained from T. patula . \nComparing the HPLC and CE methods developed for evaluation of BF of T. patula , CE was more efficient, being almost four times faster. In addition, in the CE method, organic solvents are not used to separate the analytes, and the volume of electrolytic solution used for analyses is small, making the technique less costly and polluting [ 39 \u2013 41 ]. 3.3. Larvicidal Activity \nAll the fractions of T. patula evaluated showed insecticidal activity against Ae. aegypti after 24\u2009h exposure of the larvae to a concentration of 750\u2009mg/L, with exception of AQF. \nAfter 120\u2009h (5 days) of exposure, the following mortality rates were observed at a concentration of 300\u2009mg/L for the different samples evaluated: CAE (31.0%), AQF (17.8%), EAF (53.0%), HF (13.0%), BF (15.6%), DF (8.9%), and fatty waste (31.0%). No deaths occurred during a four-day observation period for the DMSO control, but at the end of the fifth day, mortality was 6.7%. The distilled water control did not cause any mortality during the whole experiment period (Table 3 ). Table 3: Percentage of mortality of Aedes aegypti larvae exposed to different fractions of Tagetes patula under laboratory conditions at 300\u2009mg/L, for 120\u2009h. \nEAF and fatty waste showed the best time-dependent results (Figure 3 ). The lethal time for 50 percent mortality (LT 50 ) of Ae. aegypti with EAF was 96.7\u2009h (range: 78.4\u2013134.8\u2009h). Figure 3: Survival rates (log-rank test) of the immature stages of Ae. aegypti exposed to controls (distilled water and DMSO), ethyl acetate fraction, and fatty waste of Tagetes patula at 50\u2009mg/L, for 120\u2009h ( ; variance: 13.96; chi-square: 191.38). \nKomalasmisra et al. [ 42 ] demonstrated that plants with a LC 50 lower than 750\u2009mg/L for larvicidal activity are effective against Ae. aegypti . Thus, CAE and all fractions evaluated, with the exception of AQF, showed notable larvicidal activity in the present study. Among the fractions analyzed, EAF was the most promising, where a concentration as low as 50\u2009mg/L reduced the larval population by more than half, and where 750\u2009mg/L caused the death of all larvae within 96\u2009h. \nFaizi et al. [ 27 ] carried out a nematicidal study with flowers of T. patula , which were first subjected to a defatting process with petroleum ether and then extracted with methanol, finally resulting in aqueous, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and butanol fractions. In that study, EAF had a higher concentration of patuletin, while the BF showed a lower amount of this substance. The authors reported that patuletin is generally more potent than patulitrin in other biological assays, such as antimicrobial and antioxidant. \nComparing our results of larvicidal activity against Ae. aegypti with those for nematicidal activity against Heterodera zeae reported by Faizi et al. [ 27 ], it is observed that, in both studies, the fraction with better activity was that with a higher concentration of patuletin and lower level of patulitrin. Thus, it is suggested that the larvicidal activity observed in EAF may be due to the higher concentration of patuletin seen in this fraction. 4. Conclusion \nAmong the semipurified fractions obtained from CAE of the inflorescences of T. patula , BF showed a higher yield of the flavonoids patuletin and patuletin-7- O - \u03b2 -glycoside (patulitrin). \nLC-DAD-MS analysis of CAE and the fractions DF, EAF, BF, and AQF confirmed that the main substance in EAF was patuletin and patulitrin in BF. \nEAF showed the highest larvicidal activity against Ae. aegypti with more than 50% decrease in larval population at a concentration of 50\u2009mg/L. This high insecticidal activity observed in EAF may be due to the higher concentration of patuletin in this fraction. Conflicts of Interest \nThe authors have declared no conflicts of interest.

Loffredo | December 7, 2017 at 6:10 pm | Reply \nBut to be fair \u2013 most of Main Street was at a time owned by local Westport families \u2013 who over time (and mostly since probably the late 90\u2019s) sold to the highest bidder for astronomical profits and cashed out. \nThose new owners \u2013 who paid \u201cold Westporters\u201d then had to recoup what are now pretty sizable investments \u2013 by cranking up the rents which drove out the \u201cmom and pops\u201d and gave us the urban mall we have today. \nI love to reminisce and as a kid in the 70\u2019s remember when the street wasn\u2019t one way \u2013 but to let the cash enriched original landlords off the hook and blame it on some new generation of townie isn\u2019t fair, or accurate. \nBTW \u2013 Matt nice job with downtown, no longer looks like the Potterville of a few years ago with that lightning bolt running down the middle of the street. Elizabeth Thibault \nSo true. Cashing out isn\u2019t a crime, but highlighting it shows that altruism and local spirit isn\u2019t what makes the world go round. Nataiie Toraty | December 7, 2017 at 5:23 pm | Reply \nI read most of the comments, and has a business owner (not Main street, but downtown area) i have spent money (a lot) and time to showcase the holiday, Jewish or not jewish, its the holidays\u2026\u2026my store looks amazing!!!, the West Side/ West bank/Riverside joined together and made a great effort to decorate the buildings, stores restaurant etc, we are privately owned merchants creative and motivated, we have shop and stroll, late hours, every Wednesday and Saturday, just walk around get Hot Cider (with a twist or without) enjoy live music (Saturday 3-6) and get the holiday spirit\u2026. maybe just maybe you will decide to shop \ud83d\ude42 Jennifer Rankine \nI agree. I drove past your end of town tonight and it is very pretty. I\u2019s too bad the chain stores on Main Street don\u2019t follow your lead. Rabbi Danny Moss | December 7, 2017 at 6:04 pm | Reply \nHi, saying \u201cJewish town\u201d sounds reductive and low-key anti-semetic. If you want to explore the complexities of a holiday celebration in an increasingly diverse Westport; or given societal pressure to universalize the solstice season, then say something like that. Don\u2019t call it a \u201cJewish Town,\u201d which sounds unintelligent, reductive, and indicative of a passive resentment. Words matter. \nRabbi Danny Moss | December 7, 2017 at 6:58 pm | Reply \nMain street used to have so many tall/mature trees lining the sidewalks. The tradition (as many of you know) was to string lights into all the trees which gave such a beautiful glow to town. Driving up on a cold night before Xmas was always pretty magical. Jacques Voris \nFor those of you that would like to revel in the past, I have a suggestion. We came revive the traditions of my Puritan forefathers and simply cancel Christmas.

Rebecca Ellsley | December 7, 2017 at 11:15 pm | Reply \nEven Chain stores should be festive and inclusive. If they don\u2019t do it themselves then the landlords that own the buildings should do it to help promote Beautiful. Yes I am happy the zipline light down main street is gone and the new trees are a bit thin but we can handle more lights. I love the shopping stroll. The small shops have done some beautiful work decorating and people should let the shops know what looks good. Walk in let them know and maybe you find something. Giving a little Cheer helps us all. Happy Holidays To All! Phillip J. Schwartz | December 8, 2017 at 12:23 am | Reply \nI am beyond disappointed in you and your willingness to post such a statement of anti-Semitic undertones, especially during a time when Neo-Nazism is rampant and anti-Semitism has directly impacted Westport, Weston, Wilton and Ridgefield in recent months. Shame on you for this carelessness and offensive post. Michelle Benner | December 8, 2017 at 8:34 am | Reply \nI hear what you\u2019re saying, but we must support free speech in our news reporting. In this case, \u201cdon\u2019t kill the messenger\u201d but instead, thank the messenger (thank you!) for freely sharing ideas and info that can help our community have productive discussions which promote awareness.

Michelle Benner | December 8, 2017 at 8:49 am | Reply \nAnyhoo, I was downtown yesterday for some christmas shopping and I must say I agree that Westport could do more to dial up the festive feeling on main street. Church Lane and Elm street have wrapped their lamp posts with festive greenery and have hung wreaths on top. Why not on main street? The snowflakes along main are a thin approach at best. I think it would look so nice to wrap the main street lamp posts with greenery, wreaths and gold lights. And some more greenery and gold lights on the bridge. And put more pressure on the stores lining main street to add to the decorations with their store fronts. A simple window display and potted greenery like vineyard vines has done is nice. But you know how saks and bergdorff attract visitors far and wide to look at their window displays on 5th ave? Wouldn\u2019t it be fun if we could do something like that in Westport? Maybe set up a friendly competition between stores? Maybe the chamber of commerce could sponsor this and offer a prize to the employees of the winning store, the one with the best window display / holiday decorations. The prize could be a free holiday lunch or dinner together at, say, Tavern on Main. \ud83d\ude42 | December 8, 2017 at 11:12 am | Reply \nThanks Dan for opening up this conversation. As you noted in an earlier post, we at the WDMA are currently putting together a budget for improving our holiday decorations for next year. Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, we were unable to do so this year, and our president and board have kindly donated the significant cost for lighting the bridge. The bridge lighting was a big ask from our merchants, and we hope Westport will enjoy a little extra holiday light as well. Alas, unless you caught the flashing lights the other night as I was trying to adjust a few of the strands, the lights on the bridge will likely remain white. We will certainly take into consideration many of the comments from above when thinking through our decor options. We hope to find a solution that can be appreciated by the many different cultures and religions represented and celebrated in our community, and in greater Fairfield County. Additionally, we are in fact hosting a window contest this year that was mainly promoted within our merchant community to encourage holiday decor throughout downtown. Next week our judge will view all of the businesses that raised their hand, and we will post the contenders on Facebook and our website, as well as the winners the week of the 18th. We have discussed opening up the competition to the public next year (this was our trial run to see how many stores would participate), and love the idea of the winner receiving a G.C to Tavern on Main, one of our active merchant members. On December 16th you will find the beloved horse and carriage rides (thank you Matthew for mentioning!) at Bedford Square Turning Circle, with a festive holiday mini-market, Santa, carolling by the Christ and Holy Trinity Choralists and of course, the Nutcracker Festival. Connecticut Theater Dance has done a wonderful job putting together a night (the 16th gala event) and a day of tea parties, ballet performances, Santa, a kids scavenger hunt in our downtown businesses, and a vendor fair inside Branson Hall. Nutcrackerfestival.com. All that said, we do hear the voices in our community, both our merchants and residents, and we hope that we can provide some additional holiday cheer in the future. It does also come down to the stores doing their part, and it is important to understand that with online shopping, people will not be inclined to get off their sofa and devices to shop and stroll if they don\u2019t have a very good reason to do so. If your space exudes holiday spirit, and great customer service like many of our long-standing merchants (The Brownstone, Dovecote and Tavern on Main to name a few), people will be drawn to it. Jimmy Izzo | December 8, 2017 at 1:27 pm | Reply \nColleen great job on the bridge! A good blog here Dan. As a local merchant and longtime resident I have noticed the changes like many of you to our downtown. The DMA, Chamber and property owners are truly trying to make downtown attractive and a fun place to shop. Biggest problem I see and live is our buying habits have changed. We survived the chains for a long time. They are nothing new to our downtown. The question is, what does downtown Westport offer as a consumer I can\u2019t get anywhere else? What \u201cexperience\u201d or wow do I get by going to downtown Westport? We simply don\u2019t have that \u201cwow\u201d factor right now\u2026We need to find that elixir that will make it a place we want to be, rather then a place we may have to be\u2026We are blessed to have a town that consists of so many ethnic and religious back grounds, which by the way is nothing new\u2026NO Y, NO MOVIE THEATRES, LACK OF KID FRIENDLY ACTIVITIES and EATERIES, to name a few have helped dwindle pedestrian traffic as well\u2026Hopefully the cycle will turn and the downtown experience will comeback. We who had it embraced it, supported it, and will always cherish it as part of our Westport growing up. Sharon Paulsen | December 9, 2017 at 12:10 am | Reply \nAgree with your sentiment, Izzo, and in particular, this: \n\u201cThe question is, what does downtown Westport offer as a consumer I can\u2019t get anywhere else? What \u201cexperience\u201d or wow do I get by going to downtown Westport? We simply don\u2019t have that \u201cwow\u201d factor right now\u201d. \nBravo! \nOn a side note, I might add this: the recent use of LED lighting tech causes a visual and emotional disturbance (IMO). \nI personally get headaches when just glancing at a display using this type of lighting. \nI\u2019m all for green technology, etc.., but I\u2019ve read many pieces that discuss the detrimental effects of such lighting. \nIt may, if nothing else, be part of the central complaints around the \u201csterile\u201d mood invoked, when these lights are put in place of some of the \u201ctraditional\u201d style. \nJust my angle on it, in general. Nancy Hunter \nThis entire post reminds me of \u201cElf\u201d. Westport needs a better storyboard. Rhoda Emmanouil | December 9, 2017 at 10:13 am | Reply \nI was at Tavern on Main this past week, and it was beautifully decorated! You could feel the holiday spirit as soon as you walked in; the taproom was declared with garland and candles, the fireplace was going, and they had decorated a festive Christmas tree. It definitely made you feel like the holidays are here! I would recommend stopping in there for a little holiday atmosphere!
