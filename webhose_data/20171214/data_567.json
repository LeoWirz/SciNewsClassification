Photo: AFP PHOTO/ Sia Kambou \nABIDJAN \u2013 Ivory Coast will cut its armed forces by about 1,000 troops by the end of the year, a government spokesperson said on Wednesday, in a bid to rationalise a costly and sometimes unruly military. \nGovernment spokesperson Bruno Kone told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the 997 soldiers had accepted voluntary retirement this year as part of an initiative to conform to \"accepted standards\", partly by reducing the ratio of non-commissioned officers to lower ranks. \nIvory Coast does not give details on the size of its military, but security sources estimate there are more than 25,000 troops in a country with a population of about 24 million. Francophone West Africa's biggest economy suffered two army mutinies this year that damaged its reputation among investors and forced the government to agree to costly pay rises. \nREAD: Tusks and elephant tails seized in Ivory Coast: NGO \n\"The distribution of Ivory Coast's army is out of step with the standards accepted in modern armies,\" Kone said. \nThe former French colony, once known as one of the most stable states in West Africa, is still recovering from a brief civil war fought after President Alassane Ouattara won a disputed election in 2010 but incumbent Laurent Gbagbo refused to step down. \nOuattara has struggled to assert his authority over the army, which was cobbled together in an uneasy merger of the northern New Forces rebels who supported him and the professional troops who had fought against him. \nThe soldiers being taken out of action included three senior officers, 634 non-commissioned officers and 354 regular foot soldiers, Kone said. eNCA",

This [2] 2016 one proved causation of vitamin D supplementation improving symptoms, by randomly splitting into two groups and treating only one. This [3] speculative writeup by the Vitamin D Council in 2014 discusses some possible mechanisms of action.\nThis seems like such low-hanging fruit that it was extremely surprising to me that this is at the cutting edge.

You can eat sweet potato and carrots until you turn orange, but you cannot eat a single bite of polar bear liver. But because we are mostly idiots, nutritionists cannot recommend a high-dose supplement for vitamin A, with carotene in mind, because someone will inevitably overdose themselves with retinol.

"", "text": "This advice is not useful when physicians exist that will tell you a non-useful thing--or even a wrong thing--according to current consensus among nutrition specialists, because nutrition is not their specific area of expertise.\nFor instance, overdose quantities may be different among the various vitamers of a specific vitamin. Your physician will advise you not to supplement ADEK because people have overdosed on retinol or ergocalciferol, whereas you can eat carotene until you literally turn orange, and 15-30 minutes of daily midday sunlight can make 10000 to 20000 IU each time.\nThe danger of vitamin D oversupply (even as cholecalciferol) is calcium related, which is why you have to balance it with vitamin K (as menatetrenone), but it's called vitamin K from the German for \"clotting factor\", so then your doctor worries about clots. But vitamin E (as RRR-alpha-tocopherol) is also an anticoagulant. It's almost as if you have to consider every vitamin as just one part of a balanced system of nutrition...\nSo in order to give you good advice, your doctor would have to have detailed and intimate knowledge of your current nutritional state and your physiology, but we only have 15 minutes and I don't want a malpractice suit for giving you the wrong advice, so just f' it and give 'em the boilerplate: \"You don't need to supplement. Just eat a balanced diet with plenty of dark green vegetables, and get some exercise.\"\nSo there you go. I just saved you a copay, unless your particular physician has an interest in nutrition-based medicine.\nDon't get your vitamins from the corner pharmacy or the grocery store. Most of them will use the cheapest chemical that technically qualifies as a particular vitamin. You need specific vitamers if you intend to exceed the general recommendations. Do your own research, and remember that you can damage your own body by doing something stupid with it. If you consult a physician, make sure they have enough training and education to be credible with respect to nutrition and biochemistry before you fork over money for an office visit.

The best \"normal\" source is foie gras.\nNatto is not \"normal\". It is an acquired taste. The acquisition of said taste is a difficult, nauseating, and extremely stinky path.

Plant-sourced K is as phylloquinone, which has to be converted to menatetrenone in the body.\nSo also-good sources are egg yolks from free-ranging, pastured laying hens and butter from free-ranging, pastured dairy cows. Basically, you need to eat parts of animals that were raised by traditional, non-battery farming, particularly the livers and adipose tissue. Poultry animals such as geese, chickens, and ducks are good for this. Apparently, the oil from rendered emu fat is also high in vitamin K.\nCheeses have some MK-4 from the milk and some MK-7 from the bacteria, but a lot of their K is in less easily assimilated forms. That's probably good enough unless you have some rare and nigh-undetectable enzymatic deficiency that interferes with conversion of MK-9 to MK-4, or something.\nI suppose that if you force-fed some geese a bunch of natto, and then mashed up their livers into a paste, that would be a great vitamin K pate.

Billy Maldonado Cancel walked out of Hillsborough County Superior Court-North after the jury deliberated for 7\u00bd hours. Cancel testified in the trial that Jonathan Vazquez-Ojeda introduced a handgun into a fistfight on Sept. 14, 2016, his public defenders said.\u201cBilly (Cancel) grabbed ahold of it and tired to force it away, but it discharged,\u201d said his lawyer, Matthew Hill. He said the path of the bullet \u2014 through Vazquez-Ojeda\u2019s left nipple and lodging in the right hip \u2014 supported the self-defense claim. Vazquez-Ojeda\u2019s brother \u2014 Erick Davilla \u2014 testified in the trial, and said he saw Cancel pull the gun from his waist band. The jury got the case Tuesday morning and gave the verdict about 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, Hill said.\u201cWe were confident in the jury. We believed in Billy and his innocence,\u201d Hill said. His co-counsel, Julian Jefferson, added, \u201cHis acquittal proves that the system works and that this young man is able to move forward with his life.\u201d After the shooting, Cancel was on the run for about a month, and prosecutors emphasized his flight during opening arguments. He had been in Valley Street jail since Oct. 14, 2016, without bail awaiting trial. Cancel\u2019s lawyers said he broke down when he walked out of the courthouse. He found a telephone to call his mother in Puerto Rico. mhayward@unionleader.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jury", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mark hayward", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "billy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billy maldonado cancel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vazquez-ojeda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billy maldonado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan vazquez-ojeda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erick davilla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julian jefferson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillsborough county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillsborough county superior court-north", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valley street", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:33.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "28fd2cdada1144358c82e59fcbe2ed3c46740de7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSW0D8EFdrKb_UCAkWL1QXwQRpk2hpHWYRZEFoe.LhDoR4o1okzXOyn6GkgwobQQ8lC7n_7BmKbBS6YYt6lbHJLuoSoB4cvzSZc3h8SIHK5CzdWd7.646aSA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "popular links", "title": "This stray cat was hit by a car, had a broken jaw and arm.
