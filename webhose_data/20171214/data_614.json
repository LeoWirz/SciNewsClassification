So here's a way around that: Expand the playoff to 16 teams. Give all 10 conference champions a guaranteed spot. Have the playoff committee pick six additional wildcard teams based on the rankings already being conducted. Then seed teams 1-4 in four different regions, allowing the No. 1 seed to be rewarded with theoretically a weaker No. 4 seed in the opening round. And those opening round games would be played at campus sites the week after conference title games, thus rewarding No. 2 seeds as well. After the opening week of games, regional finals would be at predetermined sites, and the semifinals and final would be at locations already determined. If this process were in place this year, here's what the matchups might look like: EAST REGION 1) CLEMSON (12-1) vs. 4) FLORIDA ATLANTIC (10-3) at Clemson 2) SOUTHERN CAL (11-2) vs. 3) PENN STATE (10-2) at USC WEST REGION 1) ALABAMA (11-1) vs. 4) BOISE STATE (10-3) at Alabama 2) OHIO STATE (11-2) vs. 3) WASHINGTON (10-2) at Ohio State SOUTH REGION 1) GEORGIA (12-1) vs. 4) TROY (10-2) at Georgia 2) WISCONSIN (12-1) vs. 3) MIAMI (10-2) at Wisconsin MIDWEST REGION 1) OKLAHOMA (12-1) vs. 4) TOLEDO (11-2) at Oklahoma 2) AUBURN (10-3) vs. 3) UCF (12-0) at Auburn QUARTERFINALS East Regional Final: Miami (Orange Bowl) West Regional Final: Glendale (Fiesta Bowl) South Regional Final: Orlando (Citrus Bowl) Midwest Regional Final: Dallas (Cotton Bowl) SEMIFINALS East Winner vs. West Winner: New Orleans Semifinal South Winner vs. Midwest Winner: Pasadena Semifinal NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP: ATLANTA", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ucf", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "florida atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clemson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penn state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clemson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio state", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glendale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:08.050+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc0e8d6c2424ee2699975e555b92b1754c27b925", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pkSOsKXlzarut8llnzfeJ8bPw.ybJ7Ri4", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/o/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/o/ - Auto - 4chan", "title": "Why is BMW so scared?", "title_full": "/o/ - Why is BMW so scared?

Fearn was \" the proud owner of a 9.5 film projector \" and used to show silent, black-and-white movies from the 1920s to his friends at his home. I suspect those friends were a part of the cine-club he had founded. \nA club of early movie buffs who made and acted in their own (homemade) film productions, which included a silent movie, titled Unfinished Journey , based on a long-since lost manuscript by Fearn about \" an impossible murder on the railway .\" Lamentably, only \" a few pages of the script survive .\" Fearn was also \" an inveterate cinema goer in the 30s \" and patronized the cinema twice a week. A habit, or character-trait, he passed on to one of his literary children, Miss Maria Black, who even investigated a murder at her local cinema in One Remained Seated (1946). \nI would not be surprised if Edna May Oliver's portrayal of Stuart Palmer 's Miss Hildegarde Withers influenced the creation Miss Maria Black. After all, Fearn probably saw the movie adaptations of The Penguin Pool Murders (1931) and Murder on the Blackboard (1932) in the thirties. I commented on the possible connection between Miss Withers and Miss Black in my review of Black Maria, M.A. (1944). \n\nArguably, the most important chapter in his life as a film whizz and cinema-goer came during the darkest days of the Second World War .   \n\nFearn was declared medically unfit for combat and began to work at an aircraft factory in order to contribute to the war effort, but an opportunity landed in his lap during the second year of the war when a befriended cinema manager had began to lose projectionists \" like wildfire \" to the war-machine \u2013 eventually offering the position of (chief) projectionist to his well-known patron. Needless to say, Fearn was only an amateur with his roots in the silent movie era and had to spin the manager a tall tale about his experience, but the bulk of the technical work came down on the shoulders of his invaluable assistant. A sixteen-year-old trainee projectionist, Robert Simms , who ran the projection room once the door closed behind them. \nThis cross-generational relationship could have been a problematic one, but Fearn \" freely confessed his lack of knowledge \" of the modern equipment and was only too happy to allow Simms to be in charge behind the scenes. Simms recalled that the eccentric author was \" utterly disarming \" and they got along \" like a house on fire .\" And added that, while he ran the projection room, Fearn often entertained \" the staff with his astonishing feats of prestidigitation .\" Fearn was also an amateur magician and a member of the Magic Circle. No wonder I like the man so much !   \n\nYou can find more details of Fearn's time as chief projectionist at Blackpool's down-market Empire cinema in Philip Harbottle's introduction to his science-fiction novel The Voice of the Conqueror (1954) .   \n\nSo you can say safely state that Fearn was an experienced amateur when it came to film in all of its aspects and his knowledge, as well as his personal experiences, turned up several times in his work. I already referred to One Remained Seated and noted in my review of the book, which dates back to February of this year, that the story is fairly unique where its background is concerned, because at the time I only knew of two detective novels that (partially) took place inside a cinema \u2013 namely P.R. Shore's obscure The Death Film (1929) and the fourth victim in Agatha Christie 's The ABC Murders (1936) was murdered inside a movie theater. However, I have learned since then that Fearn penned a second detective novel with a cinema as setting. And it's an absolute gem! \n\nLast week, Harbottle had a guest-post on this blog, titled \" The Detective Fiction of John Russell Fearn ,\" in which he recommended the posthumously published Pattern of Murder (2006) and provided a back-story to the book that had existed as an unpublished manuscript for almost half a century!   \nFearn had originally titled the manuscript Many a Slip and was bylined as by \" Hugo Blayn ,\" which he had previously used for his Dr. Hiram Carruthers and Chief Inspector Garth novels, but the manuscript was rejected by his old UK hardcover publisher in 1957 \u2013 presumably on account of the shrinking lending library market and \" publishers were tightening their belts .\" Thankfully, the book eventually got published, under its brand new title, by the Linford Mystery Library and Wildside Press.   \n\nPattern of Murder is a very well-written, shrewdly plotted inverted detective story that can stand comparison with the best titles of this particular form of crime-fiction. Specifically the technical aspects of the plot are incredibly clever and the murder itself can be considered an impossible crime. \n\nThe story's antagonist, whose cunning mind and impulsive actions drive the plot, is the chief projectionist at the Cosy Cinema, Terry Lomond, who has been making money on the side by \" buying and selling substandard movie equipment \" \u2013 all of it property of the cinema. It's \" quite a racket with some projectionists \" and netted him a tidy sum of two-hundred pounds. Foolishly, he gambles his profits away at the horse races, when he over heard a hot tip, but the horse (with the great name Pirate's Cutlass) came in second. And worst of all, Terry phoned in his last-minute bet to his bookie and the money he now owed him got pick-pocketed at the racetrack. So he's now two-hundred pounds in the hole and no apparent means to scrap the money together. \n\nOnce \" a chap starts going on the wrong track \" he has \" a habit of getting deeper in \" and Terry is running down that track like the devil was on his tail. \nTerry happened to be present in the owner-manager's office when the head cashier, Madge Tansley, put away a cash-box containing over two-hundred pounds and surreptitiously obtained the safe combination. So he decided to stage a burglary at the cinema, but Murphy Law's is dogging his every step and is practically caught in the act by one of the usherettes, Very Holdsworth. However, she isn't exactly squeaky clean herself and this, initially, compelled her into silence. Only problem is that the burglary places the second projectionist, Sidney \"Sid\" Eldridge, in an awkward position and Vera told Terry she would not allow Sid to take the fall for his crime. And this placed him on a road of no return.  \n\nAs an usherette, Vera always occupies a tip-up seat fixed to the paneling at the side of the staircase during screenings. This position allowed her to see people approaching up the second half of the stairs, but Terry notices that the rearmost house-light hung directly over the tip-up seat and muses that if a house-light globe came down it would hit Vera dead on \u2013 which gave him a terrifyingly brilliant idea. I won't go into exact details, but the basic is that he would \" loosen the screws to danger point \" and uses vibrations to give the screws a final turn. And bring down the house-light globe at the exact moment of his choosing. A truly diabolical scheme!  \n\nI've debated with myself whether it would've been better had Fearn plotted Pattern of Murder along the same lines as his other excellent inverted mystery novel, Except for One Thing (1947), which showed the reader who the culprit was, but not how the crime was committed or what had happened to the body. This approach would have turned the book into a full-blown impossible crime story, because Terry was in the projection room with Sid when the globe came crashing down and the light-fixture was bare of any traces of sabotage. Only thing Terry had to do was loosening the screws and use sound-manipulation to do the rest. There would have been a scintillating array of clues to help you pick apart the how of the murder .   \n\nOn the other hand, part of the attraction of the story is that the reader is shown every step Terry takes towards his own doom and the preparations for this apparently perfect murder is the absolute highlight. You get to see the germ of the idea form, watch the experiments and fine-tuning of the plan. And, finally, appreciate the less-than-perfect execution of the plan, because (of course) something almost goes wrong and Terry's intervention would provide another clue to Sid that not all is what it seems.   \n\nYou see, Sid was very fond of Vera and becomes convinced there was more to her death than a mere accident. Slowly, he begins to piece together the aforementioned clues, which consist of a sliver of glass, a vandalized sound-track and a doctored film, but the gem-stone clues are the patterns in the dust discovered on the top of a still-case \u2013 a \" queer beauty of circles, whirligigs and crescents .\" All of them perfectly formed.   \n\nAs you probably deduced from my description of the plot, the last chapter ends with a final confrontation between Terry and Sid, but how that pans out is something you'll have find out yourself. Only thing I'll say is that (IMHO) the ending could have been more powerful had Terry, sort of, gotten away with it. The manager-owner of the cinema, Mark Turner, knew of Terry's criminal tendencies and sworn to \" shift heaven and earth to get rid of him .\" So after his confrontation with the second projectionist, Terry should have been turned out on his ear into the rainy darkness in a way that would make the reader say, \" yeah, you got away with murder, but what have you got to show for it? \" That being said, the ending Fearn went with was not bad at all. And neatly cleaned everything up for the characters who were left behind. I just thought the ending was a little bit standard for such an excellent and original crime novel. \nSo, all in all, Pattern of Murder is an ace crime novel with an authentic background and an inventive murder method, which qualifies as an impossible crime, showing that the author was as adept at writing (character-driven) inverted mysteries as he was at (plot-focused) tales of detection. I recommend this one without hesitation and as a particular treat for fans of the inverted detective story.  \nJust a heads up for my next post...

Orlando said X-rays were negative, but Fournier will be re-evaluated in the morning. He led the Magic with 27 points. \n\u201cI just saw Evan and he said it\u2019s hurting him,\u201d teammate Nikola Vucevic said. \u201cHopefully, it won\u2019t keep him out too long. He\u2019s a big part of what we do. He needs to take care and make sure he comes back healthy.\u201d \nAaron Gordon had 24 points and 15 rebounds, and Vucevic contributed 22 points, 16 rebounds and four blocks as the Magic big men dominated. Orlando outscored Atlanta 62-42 in the paint. \nThe Magic got to overtime thanks to a 3-pointer by reserve guard D.J. Augustin with six seconds left in regulation. Augustin had a wide-open look at the top of 3-point arc after getting a nice assist from Vucevic. \n\u201cD.J. is a reliable 3-pointer shooter and you know if the ball finds him, he\u2019s going to knock it down,\u201d coach Frank Vogel said. \nDennis Schroder led Atlanta with 26 points and seven assists. Taurean Prince had 19 points and Tyler Cavanaugh 13 for the Hawks, who led 96-93 with 15 seconds left in regulation after Schroder and Kent Bazemore made four straight free throws. \nThe Hawks chose not to foul and prevent Augustin from even attempting a 3-point shot in the final seconds, but coach Mike Budenholzer didn\u2019t second guess the decision. \n\u201cIt\u2019s something you debate in meetings, but we felt like we had a chance to get a stop and trust our defense,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cGive Augustin credit for hitting the shot.\u201d \n\u201cIt was a good decision not to foul,\u201d Schroder said. \u201cIf they miss, we win the game. We just have to play better defense and not let their big guys bully us around the basket.\u201d \nFournier\u2019s injury took some of the glimmer off the Magic\u2019s rally from a nine-point, fourth-quarter deficit. The Magic struggled to get any offensive rhythm for the first 3 1/2 quarters, finding themselves in an 86-77 hole with nine minutes to go. \nGordon started the rally with five straight points, and Fournier hit a driving layup that put Orlando up 93-92 with 1:59 to play. From there, both teams struggled to execute. \nBazemore hit a 3-pointer with 1:33 to play, but it was waved off after an instant replay review because of a shot-clock violation. Gordon then was charged with an offensive foul as he made a layup, but Schroder and Ersan Ilyasova both missed layups at the other end for Atlanta. \nSchroder ended the run of bad offense by hitting two free throws with 27.3 seconds left to give the Hawks a 94-93 lead and Bazemore hit two more with 14 seconds left to give Atlanta a 96-93 lead. \nThe Magic hit 6 of 10 shots in overtime, including five layups against a tired and ineffective defense. \nTIP-INS \nHAWKS: C Dewayne Dedmon missed his fourth straight game with a leg injury, and F John Collins missed his third straight with a shoulder strain. \u2026 F Marco Belinelli hit his 900th career 3-pointer in the third period. \nMAGIC: Rookie F Johnathan Isaac missed his 13th straight game with a sprained ankle. \u2026 Elfrid Payton, who shot 62.5 percent (30 of 48) in his previous five games, was just 3 of 11 against the Hawks. \u2026 Gordon is 3 of 17 from 3-point range in his last three games. \nUP NEXT \nHawks: Play the Magic again Saturday at home. \nMagic: Host Denver Friday.

UK coaches will spend much of that month trying to figure out who will replace him. Pre-Music City Bowl practices begin this weekend. In those sessions, the staff must balance the need to prepare for a game against Northwestern that could go a long way to determining the success of the 2017 season with the need to provide extended reps for younger players in preparation for the offseason. And no position is a bigger question for UK right now than quarterback. Count Johnson among those impressed with the options UK has to replace him. \u201cAll those guys have tremendous talent,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m just really looking forward to what they\u2019ve got in store for next season.\u201d MORE: Change 'inevitable' on Mark Stoops' staff, but current focus is on recruiting Here\u2019s an early look at where UK\u2019s 2018 quarterback competition stands. The favorite: The 2017 season was something of a wash for former starter Drew Barker, but he at least was able to make it through the season healthy after a back injury cost him most of the 2016 season. Barker attempted just four passes, completing two of them for 33 yards, and was sacked three times. Stoops has been consistent in his praise for Barker, who has started five games in his career, even as Johnson ended talk of a quarterback competition, but there are no shortage of questions around one of the key recruits in Stoops\u2019 tenure heading into his final season in Lexington. How will his back stand up to extended reps? How long will it take to shake off rust? How much would the offense change with him at quarterback? Remember, Barker had never handed off to running back Benny Snell in his career until a brief cameo against Tennessee when Johnson was injured. There\u2019s not enough data to fairly evaluate his ability to lead the offense yet. \nKentucky quarterback Drew Barker warms up before an NCAA college football game against Florida, Saturday, Sept. 10, 2016, in Gainesville, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux) (Photo: John Raoux, AP) The main competition: The old saying goes the backup quarterback is fans\u2019 favorite player on the roster. What does that make the backup to the backup when the backup struggles? That\u2019s the spot rising sophomore Gunnar Hoak finds himself in. While Barker did little to strengthen his case in limited snaps this season, Hoak has yet to make his debut, offering an appealing mystery to some fans. Hoak has played in two spring games, and looked like the Wildcats\u2019 best quarterback in the 2017 preseason showcase by completing 12 of 18 passes for 92 yards and two touchdowns against the first-team defense. Hoak was a candidate for the starting job after the spring game, but coaches appeared to quickly whittle that race down to Johnson and Barker in preseason camp. Hoak is a threat for the job, but there\u2019s little reason to believe he\u2019s ahead of Barker on the pecking order right now given the way snaps have been distributed to date.

(Photo: Adam Creech/Special to the Courier-Journal) The unknown: Former Lafayette star quarterback Walker Wood was projected by many pundits to move to a different position in college, but UK quarterbacks coach Darin Hinshaw raved about his potential upon arriving at his hometown college. \u201cHis (throwing) motion is literally flawless,\u201d Hinshaw said . \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect motion.\u201d The bad news is Wood, an undersized dual-threat quarterback at 6 feet, 181 pounds, has already undergone knee and shoulder surgeries. He spent most of his redshirt season this fall rehabbing from the shoulder injury and his status for bowl practices is unknown. \u201cThat kid is a stud,\u201d Johnson said of Wood. \u201cHe\u2019s in the training room. He\u2019s up here more than most of the guys here just trying get that extra work in.\u201d MORE: Five things to know about Northwestern, Kentucky's Music City Bowl opponent A newcomer: Stoops said Tuesday he is uncertain if UK will sign a quarterback in its 2018 class, but it\u2019s clear the staff is still working hard to do so. Junior-college quarterback Terry Wilson appears to be the Wildcats\u2019 top target , but he is visiting Nebraska this weekend instead of UK. Nebraska just hired Scott Frost, the coach who recruited Wilson to Oregon out of high school, as its head coach. Wilson could still visit UK depending on the results of the Nebraska trip, but the Wildcats have work to do to land him. High school quarterbacks Matthew Baldwin, Kevin Doyle and James Foster are also options to varying degrees , but only Wilson among that group seems a serious threat to win the starting job next season.

But when her former fianc\u00e9 appears on her doorstep with the eight-year-old King of Tremontane in tow, she is drawn into the political conflict surrounding the boy King's ascension. His uncle, a powerful Ascendant with the magic of manipulating the elements, murdered the old King and intends to kill young King Felix.\n\nWillow intends only to take the boy to safety, but as the days pass, she finds herself increasingly attached to Felix and unwilling to leave him once he's safe. But the pretender to the Crown has a long reach, and as his men close in on the fugitives, it seems nowhere may be safe.\n\nGoodreads \u2502 Amazon \u2502 B&N \u2502 Smashwords \u2502 Kobo \nGuest Post: The Making of Willow North \nWillow North, the main character of Pretender to the Crown , was never meant to be anything but a throwaway line. Background: my series The Crown of Tremontane was written out of order, with the third book, Agent of the Crown , written first. In that book, the main character, a princess and a spy, mentions Willow in passing, saying she always felt sorry for her because it was such a frivolous name. That was it\u2014Willow was just a bud on the North family tree, a passing joke to give my spy princess depth. \nI don\u2019t remember when Willow became a real character. Certainly by the time I wrote Rider of the Crown (second book in the series, third written) because I had to go back to Servant of the Crown (first book, second written) to insert Willow and her history. At that point, she was an important figure in Tremontanan history, but I knew no more about her than that. But she had captured my imagination. \nI love stories about rogues, and making Willow a thief satisfied that interest. But Willow had to be more than that; she had to be someone who could lead others. Willow starts the book a loner, focused on her work and disconnected from almost everyone around her. Throughout the course of the trilogy, she discovers she cares deeply, not only about her friends but about her country as well. \nWillow also has magic in a time when the country of Tremontane is ruled by magic-wielding tyrants called Ascendants. Her relationship with magic is complicated: no one can learn she has magic, or she\u2019ll be forced to become an Ascendant, but she depends on her magic, the ability to sense worked metal, for her living. Willow\u2019s talent was my husband\u2019s idea, and it\u2019s the perfect ability for a thief to have. \nIt\u2019s taken years for Willow to go from being a throwaway line to being the main character of a trilogy. I hope readers will find her as fascinating as I do. \nAbout the Author \n\nMelissa McShane is the author of several fantasy novels, including the Crown of Tremontane series, beginning with SERVANT OF THE CROWN, The Extraordinaries series, beginning with BURNING BRIGHT, and the trilogy Convergence. After a childhood spent roaming the United States, she settled in Utah with her husband, four children and a niece, two very needy cats, and a library that continues to grow out of control. She wrote reviews and critical essays for many years before turning to fiction, which is much more fun than anyone ought to be allowed to have. \nWebsite \u2502 Goodreads \u2502 Twitter \u2502 Newsletter \nTour Schedule \nNovember 30th:  Launch December 1st:  Sarra Cannon December 2nd:  W.R.

In the future, this technology could help self-driving cars anticipate future events on the road and produce more intelligent robotic assistants in homes, but the initial prototype focuses on learning simple manual skills entirely from autonomous play. Vestri the robot. Image credit: UC Berkeley via YouTube (video screenshot) \nUsing this technology, called visual foresight , the robots can predict what their cameras will see if they perform a particular sequence of movements. These robotic imaginations are still relatively simple for now \u2013 predictions made only several seconds into the future \u2013 but they are enough for the robot to figure out how to move objects around on a table without disturbing obstacles. \nCrucially, the robot can learn to perform these tasks without any help from humans or prior knowledge about physics, its environment or what the objects are. That\u2019s because the visual imagination is learned entirely from scratch from unattended and unsupervised exploration, where the robot plays with objects on a table. After this play phase, the robot builds a predictive model of the world, and can use this model to manipulate new objects that it has not seen before. \n\u201cIn the same way that we can imagine how our actions will move the objects in our environment, this method can enable a robot to visualize how different behaviors will affect the world around it,\u201d said Sergey Levine , assistant professor in Berkeley\u2019s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, whose lab developed the technology. \u201cThis can enable intelligent planning of highly flexible skills in complex real-world situations.\u201d \nThe research team will perform a demonstration of the visual foresight technology at the Neural Information Processing Systems conference in Long Beach, California, on December 5. \nAt the core of this system is a deep learning technology based on convolutional recurrent video prediction, or dynamic neural advection (DNA). DNA-based models predict how pixels in an image will move from one frame to the next based on the robot\u2019s actions. Recent improvements to this class of models, as well as greatly improved planning capabilities, have enabled robotic control based on video prediction to perform increasingly complex tasks, such as sliding toys around obstacles and repositioning multiple objects. \n\u201cIn that past, robots have learned skills with a human supervisor helping and providing feedback. What makes this work exciting is that the robots can learn a range of visual object manipulation skills entirely on their own,\u201d said Chelsea Finn , a doctoral student in Levine\u2019s lab and inventor of the original DNA model. \nWith the new technology, a robot pushes objects on a table, then uses the learned prediction model to choose motions that will move an object to a desired location. Robots use the learned model from raw camera observations to teach themselves how to avoid obstacles and push objects around obstructions. \n\u201cHumans learn object manipulation skills without any teacher through millions of interactions with a variety of objects during their lifetime. We have shown that it possible to build a robotic system that also leverages large amounts of autonomously collected data to learn widely applicable manipulation skills, specifically object pushing skills,\u201d said Frederik Ebert, a graduate student in Levine\u2019s lab who worked on the project. \nSince control through video prediction relies only on observations that can be collected autonomously by the robot, such as through camera images, the resulting method is general and broadly applicable. In contrast to conventional computer vision methods, which require humans to manually label thousands or even millions of images, building video prediction models only requires unannotated video, which can be collected by the robot entirely autonomously. Indeed, video prediction models have also been applied to datasets that represent everything from human activities to driving , with compelling results. \n\u201cChildren can learn about their world by playing with toys, moving them around, grasping, and so forth. Our aim with this research is to enable a robot to do the same: to learn about how the world works through autonomous interaction,\u201d Levine said. \u201cThe capabilities of this robot are still limited, but its skills are learned entirely automatically, and allow it to predict complex physical interactions with objects that it has never seen before by building on previously observed patterns of interaction.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "levine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea finn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergey levine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frederik ebert", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "posted today  uc berkeley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of electrical engineering and computer sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neural information processing systems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uc berkeley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "long beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkeley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:10.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1e47d2eb1e6d56518f069f05f70f2500e3a2d6a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSHy1ATlgYH6ULLSRuLQIY39fEOV.QNfX6oFBGGY.uIe5tdoLQ2f9eeBWs.9pGyj4Wk6siOvCEuY6H4wyJtJ6NT", "site_full": "www.linux.com", "site": "linux.com", "site_section": "https://www.linux.com/feeds/questions/rss", "site_categories": ["unix", "tech"], "section_title": "Linux.com - Questions and Answers", "title": "~FULL.HD.1945 Full HD Movie Watch online", "title_full": "~FULL.HD.1945 Full HD Movie Watch online", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11479, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1e47d2eb1e6d56518f069f05f70f2500e3a2d6a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSHy1ATlgYH6ULLSRuLQIY39fEOV.QNfX6oFBGGY.uIe5tdoLQ2f9eeBWs.9pGyj4Wk6siOvCEuY6H4wyJtJ6NT", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "azmul", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "~FULL.HD.1945 Full HD Movie Watch online", "text": "~FULL.HD.1945 Full HD Movie Watch online \nEnter a short description... \nWATCH HD >>> https://tinyurl.com/y9xfv5jo \nZDNet-8 hours ago It enables access to live cable TV channels such as the BBC and on-demand content including TV series and movies, he claimed.

The current level of the shares currently stands at 27.83 at the time of writing. \nThe main usage of the Parabolic SAR is for trailing stops and exit points. The principle of trading using this indicator is easy. A long position should be maintained as long as the indicator is moving above the price levels, whereas a short position \u2013 while it is below them. In addition, when the SAR changes its direction and crosses the price levels, not only the current position should be closed, but it is suggested that the opposite one should be opened at the same price levels. \nHowever, it should be used only when the market has the defined trend (around 30% of the time) and is smoother. When the trend is absent or the market is volatile, this system generates a lot of incorrect signals. Moreover, the indicator should be adjusted depending on the characteristics of the underlying shares. \nActive traders have a wide range of technical indicators at their disposal for when completing technical stock analysis. Currently, the 14-day ATR for Nushares ESG Midcap Value ETF (NUMV) is spotted at 0.14. First developed by J. Welles Wilder, the ATR may assist traders in determining if there is heightened interest in a trend, or if extreme levels may be signaling a reversal. Simply put, the ATR determines the volatility of a security over a given period of time, or the tendency of the security to move one direction or another. \nChecking in on some other technical levels, the 14-day RSI is currently at 63.67, the 7-day stands at 59.82, and the 3-day is sitting at 45.54. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a commonly used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued. A reading under 30 may indicate that the stock is oversold, and possibly undervalued. \nAnother technical indicator that may be a powerful resource for determining trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Nushares ESG Midcap Value ETF (NUMV) is noted at 30.87. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. \nThe Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is another technical indicator worth taking a look at. Nushares ESG Midcap Value ETF (NUMV) currently has a 14 day Williams %R of -32.61. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. If the indicator travels under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. Chart analysts may also use the indicator to project possible price reversals and to define trends. \nNushares ESG Midcap Value ETF (NUMV) currently has   64.29. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nushares esg midcap value etf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nushares", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parabolic sar", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:10.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b838f36924ffd4527dd6892aa9f6922ce52f9d6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoc3V2thgXJuQua0W2zPgg.isQw48DKTx17kkrYzE_FR_NCBFnAfFefv8kmaqdrSWVTpeip9Hzw2bjb8BNCIvl6UWbvTDn6D8M-", "site_full": "buzzyscountrystore.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://buzzyscountrystore.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Buzzy's Country Store", "title": "Newman's Very Own Tax Break", "title_full": "Newman's Very Own Tax Break", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b838f36924ffd4527dd6892aa9f6922ce52f9d6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoc3V2thgXJuQua0W2zPgg.isQw48DKTx17kkrYzE_FR_NCBFnAfFefv8kmaqdrSWVTpeip9Hzw2bjb8BNCIvl6UWbvTDn6D8M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "J.

(And for all those of you who are eagerly anticipating your \"massive\" tax cut, I know a Nigerian Prince who is dying to meet you.) However, there is one entity in the new tax bill that will definitely be seeing a huge tax cut and that's Paul Newman's Own company. The background and explanations for the Newman tax carve out in the bill are a bit complicated but it has to do with Newman's being a philanthropic business that donates all of its profits to charity. For some screwy reason, when Paul died and the business passed to his foundation, some crazy tax rules kicked in that now require them to pay a huge chunk of change to Uncle Sam. The new tax bill will eliminate that tax requirement and allow Newman's Own to continue donating all of its profits to charity. (If you would like a better explanation of this than my Cliff Notes' review of it ( click here.) All of which makes me think that maybe I should make Buzzy's a philanthropic operation too.
