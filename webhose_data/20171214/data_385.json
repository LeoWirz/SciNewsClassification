After all, that\u2019s what \u201ceverybody\u201d says, right? \nBut then I did something stupid\u2026 \nI started looking at the clinical research of rapid fat loss versus the science of slow and steady fat loss. And what I discovered SHOCKED me. Because despite what I\u2019d always heard, it turns out.. \nI know this sounds unbelievable. I know this flies in the face of what you\u2019ve always been told. But the science backs me up. See for yourself: \nIt\u2019s Murder On Your Metabolism \nScientists from Newcastle University put this common misconception to the test. They took 3 groups of over overweight men and put them on a diet. \nThe first group had it the toughest. They got no food \u2013 water only \u2013 for six days. \nThe 2ndgroup followed a very low calorie diet (approximately 600 calories day) for 3 weeks. \nThe 3rdgroup followed a slightly easier diet (1200 calories per day) for 6 weeks. \nAll groups ended up losing approximately 5% of their bodyweight. The difference is how long it took. Group 1 did it in 6 days. Group two did it in 3 weeks. Group 3 did it in 6 weeks. \nNo surprise there. But what IS surprising is that resting metabolism dropped the MOST in the six week diet group. The 3 week diet group saw the 2ndbiggest drop in resting metabolism. And the 6-day fasting group saw the SMALLEST drop in resting metabolism! So the research is clear. Losing fat slowly is HORRIBLE for your metabolism. \nSiervo, Mario, et al. \u201cImposed rate and extent of weight loss in obese men and adaptive changes in resting and total energy expenditure.\u201d Metabolism (2015): Accepted Article. \nIt Kills Your Chances Of Actually Losing Pure FAT \nResearchers took a group of mice and put them on a 5% caloric restricted diet. This means they ate 5% fewer calories than usual. This is the very definition of a \u201cslow & steady\u201d diet. The opposite of a crash diet. \nSo we\u2019d expect good results, right? \nIn just 3 weeks of this \u201cslow & steady\u201d diet, here\u2019s what happened to these rats: \nFat Mass went UP. (They gained fat.) \nLean mass DECREASED. (They LOST lean mass.) \nThere was a decrease in their total energy expenditure (they became less active) \nThere was a decrease in their resting energy expenditure (metabolism slowed down.) \nSo clearly trying to lose weight with a mild (5%) caloric deficit is a recipe for disaster if you are a rat. But humans are different right? Check out the next drop down box (Bad for your hormones) to see why slow and steady fat loss is a bad idea for us humans too\u2026 \nLi X, Cope MB, Johnson MS, Smith DL Jr, Nagy TR. Mild calorie restriction induces fat accumulation in female C57BL/6J mice. Obesity (Silver Spring). 2010 Mar;18(3):456-62. \nIt\u2019s Horrible For Your Hormones \nEver heard the idea that you should lose fat slowly because if you lose fat too fast it will screw up your hormones? Turns that\u2019s really an old wives tale.Here\u2019s the truth:A human study examining the effects of long-term mild-caloric deficit dieting in humans found that long-term dieters suffered from 78% lower testosterone levels and 28% lower VO2Max levels!The research is clear: Slow & steady dieting is WORSE for your hormones. \nFontana L, Klein S, Holloszy JO. Effects of long-term calorie restriction and endurance exercise on glucose tolerance, insulin action, and adipokine production. Age (Dordr). 2010 Mar;32(1):97-108. \nAnd the final kick in the teeth: Lose fat slowly and you\u2019re MORE likely to gain it all back! \nI know this is surprising because we\u2019ve always been told that \u201ccrash\u201d dieting leads to \u201cyo-yo\u201d weight gain. But science paints a different picture: \nA long-term analysis of European dieters showed that dieters who lost the most weight during an initial 8-week diet phase were the most successful at KEEPING the weight off six months later. This principle held true even when the dieters were using a very low-calorie approach (less than 800 calories a day) during their initial weight loss phase. Scientifically-validated research proves that if you want to lose weight AND KEEP IT OFF, you should lose the weight FAST. \nWong MHT, Holst C, Astrup A, Handjieva-Darlenska T, Jebb SA. Caloric Restriction Induces Changes in Insulin and Body Weight Measurements That Are Inversely Associated with Subsequent Weight Regain. PLoS ONE. 2012; 7(8): e42858. \nWant to successfully get lean? Approach fat loss like a bank heist. \nThe research is clear. You should approach fat loss like a smash-and-grab bank robber: Get in, get the job done, and get right back to your normal life as fast and possible. In other words, don\u2019t stay on a \u201cdiet\u201d for a single minute longer than absolutely necessary. Now that you know WHY you should aim to lose your unwanted fat as fast as possible, here is HOW it\u2019s done: \nIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve probably tried low-carb diets in the past. And maybe you see some \u201cok\u201d results, but you could never get truly lean. That\u2019s because the standard low-carb diet SUCKS when it comes to losing maximum fat in minimum time. Instead, scientifically cycle (or \u201cshift\u201d) your calories and your carbohydrate intake. Research shows by scientifically cycling/shifting your calories and your carbs, you can actually burn 2.6X more fat as compared to standard dieting. In other words, you could be done with your diet in 30 days instead of 90 days! \nA low carb diet is fine for slow weight loss. But when you intelligently cycle your carb intake, you can lose fat 2.6x faster. \nDavoodi, Sayed Hossein, et al. \u201cCalorie Shifting Diet Versus Calorie Restriction Diet: A Comparative Clinical Trial Study.\u201d International journal of preventive medicine 5.4 (2014b): 447. \nI did ZERO minutes of cardio during my transformation. Nada. \nI spent ZERO minutes on the treadmill during my incredible 29 day transformation. ZERO minute on the elliptical machine or exercise bike. ZERO minutes jogging, walking, running or swimming. \nIn case I\u2019m not making myself clear, I did absolutely ZERO cardio. None. Nada. \nBecause when it comes to burning fat, cardio is an absolute waste of time. \nDid you know that running a full-marathon \u2014 26.2 miles \u2013burns just 2,800 calories? That\u2019s roughly 1/2 pound of fat. \nThink about that for a second: If you went out a ran a full marathon \u2014 26.2 miles \u2014 every single Saturday you would lose LESS than 2 pounds of fat after a month! \nI don\u2019t know about you, but running for 6 hours straight on the weekends isn\u2019t my idea of a good time. Clearly, there\u2019s got to be a better way. \nBorsheim, E. and Bahr, R. 2003. Effect of exercise intensity, duration and mode on post-exercise oxygen consumption. Sports Medicine, 33(14) 1037-1060. \nMost people are shocked when I tell them I didn\u2019t do a single lick of cardio during my incredible 29 day transformation. But when I reveal that I actually had 3 cheat meals per week, AND I drank beer AND enjoyed chocolate, their jaws hit the floor. But I had a very good reason for drinking beer and eating chocolate. The alcohol and the beer and actually helped me lose fat FASTER! I explain exactly how this works on page 41 of my program. And don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t like beer \u2014 you can use red wine or other alcoholic drinks too. Or you can skip the alcohol all together and just load up on chocolate! \nThis is my favorite beer. I drank 4-6 beers per week to SPEED UP fat loss. \nThere was a scientific reason behind the cheat meals as well. They helped maintain muscle mass, increased fat burning and kept my fat-burning hormones running sky high. The trick is eating the cheat meals at the right TIME. This is covered in depth on page 32 of my program. \nAs you can see, my plan was based on scientifically proven principles for losing fat quickly. And now I\u2019m inviting you to join me and get in the best shape of your life in the next 29 days. Introducing\u2026 \nThis is the underground manual \u201cthey\u201d don\u2019t want you to know about. This is the step-by-step playbook that takes you by the hand and shows you exactly how to melt away all your unwanted body fat as fast as possible. \nIn this manual, I\u2019ll reveal the exact plan I used to shed an incredible 13 pounds of fat and get ripped in just 29 days. You\u2019ll also discover\u2026 \nThe Aggressive Fat Loss Bible \nPlus everything else you need to know to get lean fast. \nHere Are The Top 6 Frequently Asked Questions \nWill this work for me? I have a lot of weight to lose! \nYes! This plan works for people trying to lose those last 10lbs of stubborn fat AND anyone who needs to lose 20, 30, 50 pounds or more! And the great thing is, the more weigh you need to lose, the faster you\u2019ll lose the weight! \nYou\u2019ll notice I \u201conly\u201d lost 13 pounds of fat in a month mainly because I only had 13 pounds of fat to lose. But one of my students (who had more fat to lose) lost a whopping 18 pounds in just one month. \nClint lost 18 pounds in a month with the aggressive fat loss approach. \nWon\u2019t I Just Gain It All Back? \nNope! That\u2019s the awesome thing about this plan. I not only show you how to lose the fat fast, but I also teach you an easy method to keep it off without \u201cliving on a diet\u201d for the rest of your life.The great thing about getting lean is that lean people can PIG OUT and not gain an ounce of fat. Research shows that people who are ALREADY lean can pig out every single weekend and not gain a single ounce of fat! This is why getting lean is tough but staying lean is EASY! Sagayama, Hiroyuki, et al. \u201cMeasurement of body composition in response to a short period of overfeeding.\u201d Journal of physiological anthropology 33.1 (2014): 29. \nI\u2019m very busy. What kind of workouts must I do on this plan? \nProbably a lot less than you think. Here\u2019s the truth: Any time you go on a diet, you must do some form of resistance training. This is super important because resistance training signals your body to preserve lean muscle mass and burn fat (not muscle) for energy. Cardio training, however, it basically useless. It doesn\u2019t burn very many calories and just makes you hungrier. So you\u2019ll need to do 3 resistance training workouts per week. Each workout will only take you 30-60 minutes total. Inside the manual, I show you the exact workout plan I followed AND I give you some alternatives if you prefer to exercise at home using bodyweight resistance. \nI\u2019m older. Will this work for me? \nYes! Losing fat gets more difficult as we get older. That\u2019s no secret. But there are certain tricks you can use to speed up the process. For example, my trick that boosts growth hormone by 500% (revealed on page 36 of the book) works extremely well for older trainees. In short \u2014 if you\u2019re willing to follow the instructions, this plan can get you ripped no matter what year you were born. \nOlder guys can still get ripped too. \nWill this plan work for females? \nYes ma\u2019am! The science of fat loss is the same for both men and women. This plan will help any woman shed fat quickly without screwing up your metabolism or making your life miserable. In fact, you\u2019ll probably end up eating MORE food than you are used to with this plan, and workout out LESS \u2014 but still getting leaner than ever before! \nYup, you can get lean FAST and still enjoy wine and chocolate. \nI\u2019ll give you a full 60 days to check out this program \u2014 but you\u2019ll see results within the very first week. No joke. In the first 7 days, you\u2019ll drop fat, trim your waist and start seeing a leaner, harder physique. If you follow the program, you will see rapid physique improvement. But if for any reason you decide this simply isn\u2019t for you, shoot me an email or give me a call and I\u2019ll immediately refund your order. No hassles, no hard feelings, no hoops to jump through. \nOn page 17 of The Aggressive Fat Loss Bible, I give you my personal email address and my private cell phone number. If you ever have a question or need a bit of help you can send me an email or just call/text my cell phone and I\u2019ll be there to help you out. This is like having your own physique transformation coach on speed dial! \nNow it\u2019s time to get started. At this very moment, you could have your \u201cdream body\u201d in 30 days or less. So there\u2019s no reason to wait another minute. Order The Aggressive Fat Loss Bible right now, lock in your savings, discover the secrets of rapid fat loss and get the kind of body you\u2019ve always wanted in less time than you ever imagined. \nCandid photo of me and my family on the beach.

Australia has already\r\nfar overshot the sustainable level of population.\r\nThe solution is to immediately introduce a zero\r\nimmigration policy and abolish welfare for\r\nbreeding subhuman locusts. As the few remaining\r\nAussie industries devolve into primitive stone-age\r\noperations, the tendency of media morons and\r\nquislings is to bleat for cheaper imported scab\r\nlabour to make-up for lack of investment in\r\nautomation and mechanization. It will be\r\nimpossible to move without breaking some globalist\r\nregulation in Australia's new third world cities\r\nof urban consolidation (crowding), where there\r\nwon't be space to breathe, move or work, but where\r\nunearned real estate profits are high.\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as \"multicultural\" harmony. The globalist cocksuckers lied\r\n\r\nNow we know why Kelvin Thomson likened toxic\r\nimmigration to a Ponzi scheme. Using the analogy\r\nof a fraudulent business practice, he challenged\r\nthe idea of bringing in more immigrants to support\r\nAustralia's fraudulent property bubble economy. We\r\ndon't need population growth, but it is pushed by\r\nbig business. It just reduces our standard of\r\nliving and quality of life. That people\r\nregurgitate growthist propaganda, shows Australian\r\nsuckers have swallowed this globalist bullshit. It\r\nworries me that any debate on population in\r\nAustralia excludes the social cohesion factor or\r\nthe non economic issues. Both major parties and an\r\nelement in the Greens (and possibly others) just\r\ndisregard the electorate's concerns on these\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nCanadian failure: Mass immigration gave Toronto the worst gridlock in North America\r\n\r\nMulticulturalism does not seek an average\r\nintelligence; it hungers for mediocre dullness\r\nthat finds comfort and submergence in the\r\nshuffling conformist mob, surrounded by oneness of\r\nmind, with lemmings that ooze like-thinking\r\nconcurrence. It is because our globalist\r\npoliticians are bribed to betray Australians to\r\nglobal cabals, that public life exudes a stench of\r\nmoral compromise and treason, and why most of our\r\npolitical \"leaders\" are moral pygmies, dissolutes,\r\nperverts, and liars. Under globalism with its\r\nplague immigration, citizens of Australia are\r\nbeing taught that their citizenship means almost\r\nnothing when wealthy parasites want cheap imported\r\nlabour and more desperation in the housing market.\r\n\r\nAre you stupid sheeple holding your breath waiting for the surge of rich, brown, multicultural prosperity to arrive?\r\n\r\nWhen results of immigration legislation vary from\r\nelection promises so drastically, as we have seen,\r\nwe must wonder if our \"representatives\" are\r\nengaged in a widespread conspiracy to lie to us\r\nall, or if they simply don't know what they are\r\ndoing. Our quisling \"leaders\" sometimes look\r\ncompetent, but don't let that fool you, they\r\nprobably seek enlightenment by inspecting fish\r\nentrails. They are more likely to be struck by\r\nlightning than ever doing the right thing by us.\r\nIt often takes a long period of globalist gutting\r\nbefore citizens begin to notice their nation has\r\nno substance, and is a hollow shell. The globalist\r\nvampires leave sufficient blood after each feast,\r\nto keep the victim nation barely alive.\r\n\r\nThe globalist violators of national integrity\r\n\r\n\"A big stupid third world Australia\" is what the\r\nglobalist billionaires want, and compliant Aussie\r\nfools are helping them to get it cheaply. All of\r\nthose who enter this fatal race to the bottom will\r\nbe certain losers. Must asylum-seekers stay\r\nforever? The Geneva Convention relating to\r\nRefugees says that when the circumstances in their\r\nhome country which made them seek asylum have\r\nchanged, the Convention ceases to apply to them -\r\nso they may be sent back home. The new Stalinist\r\n\"Stack and Pack\" slums Aussies are expected to\r\ntolerate, are just breeding pens for mindless\r\nlemmings, and massive turd factories. Plague\r\nimmigration makes this globalist miracle of\r\ncultural genocide possible.\r\n\r\nOur elected bipartisan quislings will leave us with the massive opportunity costs of their infrastructure white elephants\r\n\r\nMulticulturalism actively ignores and obscures the\r\nreal meaning of the English word \"Nation\" - which\r\nmeans a race, a people who share a common\r\nancestry, experience, and traditions - much more\r\nthan an entity officially recognized by the UN.\r\nIt's the same in all third world shit-holes. They\r\nbreed as though there is unlimited room and food\r\nand jobs. Then they riot, After they kill-off a\r\nfew million they feel much better. The last thing\r\nthey want is freedom, because others might\r\nbenefit. Multiculturalism is where lost souls,\r\ngangsters and hopeless dimwits congregate. It\r\nmakes them feel safer, but unleashes savage mayhem\r\nwithin our society. Sadly, there are more people\r\nthan ever that are losing their wits, and losing\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nWith great hunger for unearned real estate profits, Satan's multicultural hate-child was spawned\r\n\r\nThink about this. If the USA's ENTIRE 1970 corn\r\ncrop got converted to alcohol, it could have\r\nsupplied less than 7.5 percent of that year's\r\ndomestic demand for motor fuel! It would have\r\nsupplied only 1.27 percent of total US energy\r\nconsumption. It's beyond the \"intellects\" in our\r\nquisling Government, to understand that more\r\npeople consuming more, means more carbon emission.\r\nSo Aussies will justifiably be angry when they\r\ndiscover that government plans will not reduce\r\ngreenhouse gas emissions. The basic question that\r\nhas to be asked about current Australian\r\nimmigration policies is this: Why is Australia\r\nbringing in so many people? It is largely because\r\nlucrative real estate rackets get boosted by mass\r\nimmigration.\r\n\r\nI reject the claimed divinity of multiculturalism\r\n\r\nIt does seem more than a coincidence that the\r\nWestern (global) economy has gone pear shaped\r\nsince the surge of brute-force immigration over\r\nthe last ten years. Plague immigration certainly\r\nhas not saved us. The chill winds of reality will\r\nblow. I look forward to the day that unsustainable\r\nand criminal plague immigration Ponzi schemes are\r\noutlawed, and those who promoted them or made huge\r\nunearned profits from them are executed for\r\ntreason. Contrary to noisy official propaganda\r\nabout imaginary universal benefits, government\r\ndisgracefully pursued a plague immigration policy\r\nbased on narrow and corrupt political interests,\r\nwhile opening new opportunities for real estate\r\nracketeering.\r\n\r\nMulticulturalism (plague immigration) does not bring something better, it brings something much worse\r\n\r\nThe \"experts\" couldn't see an obvious global\r\nfinancial collapse developing, so we should not\r\nlet them sell us globalism, multiculturalism,\r\ncultural diversity or any such ratbaggery. Angela\r\nMerkel said multiculturalism had \"utterly failed\",\r\nand British PM David Cameron said \"state\r\nmulticulturalism fostered division\", but our\r\nratbag Immigration Minister Chris Bowen squeaked\r\nthat Aussie multiculturalism was built\r\ndifferently... Now that Aussies are snared and\r\nentangled in Ponzi schemes and real estate debt\r\nbubbles, they want lower interest rates. They may\r\nwant debt to have a lower price, but do they\r\nreally want more debt? Plague immigration has\r\nbaited this debt-trap.\r\n\r\nOur invertebrate \"leaders\" are not prepared to protect the shared natural heritage of this country\r\n\r\nThe plague locust mentality is typical of the\r\nsubhuman species. Breeders are determined to have\r\nas many children as they can. This self-indulgence\r\nin procreation mostly happens in the poorest and\r\nthe least healthy families. We watched as\r\nAustralia descended into the abyss of bulk\r\nimmigration and cultural diversity. As globalism\r\nand multiculturalism moved in, common sense moved\r\nout. Colonizing our nation by waves of third world\r\nplague immigration, has been made easy for\r\nglobalist parasites by inducing national guilt. An\r\nold psychological trick used by despots to\r\nre-vitalize themselves by sucking our collective\r\nlife-force.\r\n\r\nThe insane identification of multiculturalism with Heaven\r\n\r\nAustralians must be literally mad, cringing to\r\nimported third world flesh. A nation heaping up\r\nits own funeral pyre. So corrupt are population\r\ngrowth addicts, that they deprive Australians to\r\nprovide housing and services for immigrants. Our\r\nquisling \"leaders\" preside over a mass influx of\r\nthird world dross, including psychotics,\r\ncriminals, frauds and psychopaths. The objections\r\nof Australians did not worry our elected\r\nrepresentatives, who just applied the putrid\r\n\"racist\" defamation. Don't support Israel. Jewish\r\nagents are major organizers of Muslim immigration\r\nto Anglophone countries, mainly through their\r\ninfluence in the mass media. They actively defame,\r\nintimidate, prosecute, and silence opponents of\r\nbrute-force immigration.\r\n\r\nWhen you combine idiocy and plague immigration, you get some pretty interesting results\r\n\r\nWe are starting to see is the awful result of\r\nimporting ethnic scab labour. What our dirty\r\nimmigrationist quislings are selling is nothing\r\nbut a putrid Ponzi scheme. When, and if, politics\r\nand economics become honest, I'll take them\r\nseriously. What mostly \"trickles down\" to the\r\nsubhuman resources, in this \"winner take all\"\r\nproperty market society, is not prosperity, but\r\nsomething much more unpleasant and pestilent like\r\npoverty, homelessness and violence. Because of the\r\nhand of conspiracy, which you insist does not\r\nexist, ignorance is all. Logic, Truth, and Justice\r\nare dead, and while you watch your job being\r\ndownsized or outsourced, the globalist devils\r\ndance and clink their glasses.\r\n\r\nEthnic diversity myths and real bursting sewers\r\n\r\nThe world's resources - and that is what large\r\ncorporations and corrupt politicians will not\r\ngrasp - are finite and will not support our\r\nexpanding population beyond the next few years.\r\nOur \"leaders\" sell-us out with plague immigration\r\nand globalism. A globalist society is being\r\nspawned where those with the most unsociable\r\nbehaviours, deviant lifestyles, or personal\r\nfailures are given the most by government.\r\nImporting cheap labour from failed third world\r\nnations, accelerates this process. Every time\r\nAussies deal with unaffordable housing,\r\nunemployment, high prices, congestion, sprawl,\r\nsocial violence and reduced quality of life, they\r\ncan thank one political party in government after\r\nanother that raised or maintained mass\r\nimmigration.\r\n\r\nGlobalism: Its sycophants, quislings and hypocrites\r\n\r\nOur corrupt megalomaniacal multiculturalist\r\npoliticians refuse to carry out their duties of\r\noffice to protect our country from invasion, in\r\nthis case by millions of third world aliens.\r\nPoverty is entrenched: A new report on poverty\r\nfound that two million Australians live in poverty\r\n- one Aussie in ten, with more than half a million\r\nchildren living in jobless families. The numbers\r\nof \"working poor\" are rocketing. Globalist change\r\nagents need to preserve the illusion of community\r\nparticipation in immigration matters, yet decent\r\ncitizens are squeezed out. The preordained\r\nimmigrationist viewpoint is made to appear\r\nsensible, while rational dissent is ridiculed.\r\n\r\nThe uncontrolled ramification of the multicultural inversion of morality\r\n\r\nUnearned real estate profit is the driving force\r\nbehind the great multicultural dream of\r\ngeneralized third world poverty through plague\r\nimmigration. The political short-sightedness of\r\nthe average Aussie allows this to pass unnoticed.\r\nThe political Left, thinking that mass immigration\r\nwould a give blood transfusion to their feeble\r\nideology, were suddenly infected by the same\r\ngrowth-fever that festered inside the worst\r\nright-wing capitalists, landed gentry and\r\nPonzi-scheme shonks. How politicians trick you\r\ninto crap they want and that you will hate. It is\r\neasy. Suggest a really outrageous \"reform\" or\r\ndevelopment. When the sheeple get restless,\r\n\"compromise\" by imposing something only half as\r\nawful as the original abortion.\r\n\r\nThe same dirty old Ponzi schemes and poisonous plague immigration are tarted up with weasel words like tolerance and diversity\r\n\r\nThere must be a final limit to plague immigration\r\nor the nation's centre will not hold. There will\r\nbe real warfare between the native-born and the\r\nimported scab labour. It has always been thus, and\r\nit will get worse as poverty and scarcity\r\nincrease. The awful realities of slave wages and\r\ntotally unaffordable housing explain why opinion\r\nsurveys consistently show that the majority of\r\nAussies are vehemently against further plague\r\nimmigration. Let's speak up for powerless low-paid\r\nAussie workers. Australian government bulk\r\nimmigration policy is an extremist political\r\npolicy. Greed-maddened politicians and globalist\r\nmedia drones trumpeting toxic immigration\r\npropaganda feeds the cargo-cult growth fetish.\r\n\r\nYes, mass immigration from the third world is just like having a burst sewer in your own backyard\r\n\r\nThe planet's irreplaceable natural assets have\r\nbeen catastrophically drawn down, and there is no\r\nway of replacing them. This is perhaps a most\r\nrevolutionary question, but why populate in the\r\nfirst place, what are we really trying to do here?\r\nSometimes, politicians vomit pre-election rhetoric\r\nthat raises our hopes with its lies, but we all\r\nknow that our quisling leaders are no more\r\ncommitted to controlling plague immigration than\r\nvampires would be about kicking their blood\r\naddictions. Any actual economic growth due to\r\npopulation growth will end when our resources run\r\nout. By then it will be too late to be thinking\r\nabout sustainability, and Australia will have\r\nstarving and angry ethnic hordes within its\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nRotten with imported disease, crime and filth\r\n\r\nThere is no escaping the fact that if Australia\r\ncontinues down the plague immigration road, we as\r\nAustralians are doomed. If we fight back against\r\nglobalist Stalinism, we risk being subjected to\r\nterror attacks from elected quislings in\r\ngovernment. The imported ethnic scab labour\r\ninvasion is driving Australians towards piddling\r\nthird world incomes and confinement in Asian-style\r\n\"Stack and Pack\" slums resembling Stalinist\r\npenitentiaries. The signs of instability and\r\ncollapse are everywhere. To any Aussie resident\r\nfaced with seeing their suburb ruined with\r\nStalinist \"Stack and Pack\" slums, it would seem\r\nthat the Department of Immigration, State\r\nGovernment, and property developers are little\r\nmore than a corrupt triad from the third world.\r\n\r\nThe Great Australian Dream was gutted by an unsustainable plague immigration Ponzi scheme\r\n\r\nThe globalist schemers envision a world government\r\ncomposed of forcibly federated states, which,\r\nproperly speaking, are Open Borders police states.\r\nThey have no more concern for the rights of human\r\nresources than Stalin did for his miserable\r\nworkers. Toxic immigration is so effective at\r\ndirecting money away from the workers, and into\r\nthe grasp of plague landlords, property\r\nspeculators and their ilk, that most Australians\r\ncan't get by without massively borrowing. How\r\nsustainable is that? The national struggle today,\r\nis almost dead. Australians plan their collective\r\nglobalist suicide in resignation. Subhuman\r\nmulticultural idiocy and alien ideologies of\r\nsociopathic greed have a monstrous grip on the\r\nnational soul.\r\n\r\nGay Christians use our money and their pulpits to screech for mass immigration\r\n\r\nThese are plague immigration times. The low\r\ncollective intelligence of the little Aussie\r\ndullards, encouraged their globalist stooge\r\ngovernments to replace them with floods of\r\nimported scab labour. Democracy fails when the\r\ncitizens are idiots. Through globalism, plague\r\nimmigration, overpopulation and ethnic strife, the\r\nmass-murder of individuals will become common. For\r\npolitical or delusional reasons, governments will\r\nincreasingly interrogate, coerce and assault their\r\nown citizens. Unpayable Australian household debt\r\nmoved Aussies a huge step closer to their violent,\r\nimpoverished, third world future. This\r\n\"prosperous\" new Australia is more about exclusion\r\nthan inclusion, despite all the silly globalist\r\nmulticultural rhetoric.\r\n\r\nWhen billionaires want valuable real estate\r\n\r\nThe John Howard and Peter Costello flea circus has\r\nbeen driven out of town, and what a joy it was!\r\nBut don't imagine that much has changed. There are\r\nstill plenty of globalist fleas hopping around and\r\nbloodsucking as usual. With plague immigration,\r\nthe bottom line is this: Fewer decent jobs.\r\nHousing will be impossible to secure. Medical and\r\nhospital services will be unaffordable. Travel\r\nwill be massively time consuming. Disease, poverty\r\nand violence will explode. Competition for\r\nemployment is a negative effect of overpopulation.\r\nJobs are more automated and efficient, requiring\r\nless manpower, and other jobs are \"outsourced\" or\r\ngo to imported scab labour, as the overpopulation\r\ncontinues to expand.\r\n\r\nThe evil that lurks within Jewish billionaires revealed\r\n\r\nThe portrayal of plague immigration and cultural\r\ndiversity as the heroes that will save Australia,\r\nfell over on its face in the recent election. The\r\npolitical will to defend multiculturalism instead\r\nof Australia, evaporated. I view multiculturalism\r\nas the negation of the Australian citizen and\r\nnation. Plague immigration reduces Australians to\r\npassively witnessing their own cultural genocide.\r\nJoining the alien globalist herd is the antithesis\r\nof patriotism. You know the story. They say the\r\nsolution to a credit and debt crisis isn't to stop\r\nspending, or to stop going further into debt. The\r\nsolution is - to spend more! And to go further\r\ninto debt, to encourage the banks to lend again.\r\n\r\nYes my little sheeple, plague immigration is a scam\r\n\r\nIf you are a multiculturalist, it may take many\r\nyears for you to fully remove your head from your\r\narse, but I think you should make the effort.\r\nThere would be one less mindless robot addicted to\r\nsports spectaculars and globalist spin. Immigrants\r\nusually add to GDP. The country's overall economic\r\nactivity might increase. It doesn't matter to our\r\n\"leaders\" that the quality of life for the native\r\ninhabitants falls, or that the environment is\r\nbeing systematically destroyed. Quisling\r\npoliticians gloried in telling cheering university\r\nnongs, that thanks to plague immigration and\r\nglobalist treason, Aussies would soon be the\r\nminority in their own country. Within ten years,\r\nAustralia will collapse as a coherent nation.\r\n\r\nCanadian Multicultural News: Just as bad as Australian multicultural news\r\n\r\nAustralia will be politically destroyed within\r\nabout 20 years if the current political system is\r\nnot removed. The plan is to replace Australians\r\nwith Asians, and for Australia to become a vassal\r\nof a regional APEC government. This \"golden age\"\r\nof plague immigration, real estate Ponzi schemes\r\nand imported scab labour, is the manifestation of\r\nan inhuman, malevolent, predatory, rapacious\r\nenergy. This is the truth about the \"excellence\"\r\nof globalism and its growth cargo-cult. The\r\nbackbone of globalism is made from pointless human\r\nmisery and entrenched political corruption. A\r\npredatory plot against nations, with unearned\r\nrewards and unrewarded duties. The born-idiots may\r\naccept this travesty, but living humans cannot.\r\n\r\nThe rough end of the plague immigration pineapple\r\n\r\nAs long as plague immigrationists deny any link\r\nbetween mass immigration and lower wages, as long\r\nas they refuse to see that unaffordable housing is\r\nnot so positive, they will be seen as out of\r\ntouch, in denial, and as utopian fantasists. We\r\nare in the terminal phase of this Ponzi scheme\r\neconomy. The window of opportunity for increasing\r\nplague immigration is closing fast. The damage to\r\nAustralia has been too great, and the\r\nsocio-political landscape is probably at the\r\ntipping point. The new grammar of\r\nmulticulturalism, and cultural diversity is\r\nconstructed in a way that George Orwell would have\r\nappreciated, because its rules make some important\r\nideas impossible to express - unless one wants to\r\nbe called a racist.\r\n\r\nThe entire political establishment consists of professional liars and perverts\r\n\r\nMass immigration is doomed, because the natives\r\nknow one simple truth: immigrants are coming to\r\ntake what they have. The more immigrants the\r\nrobber barons import to drive down wages, the more\r\nthat fear and resentment grows, until it explodes.\r\nAussies can never be confident about their\r\nmendacious Government's total immigration and\r\nunemployment figures. Australia is already\r\noverpopulated and depleting its own future through\r\nsheer ignorance. High immigration intakes are\r\ncrazy. Plague immigration means the certain death\r\nof all that is unique and good about Australia. It\r\nmeans slavery and confinement in Stalinist \"Stack\r\nand Pack\" slums. It means eating recycled shit and\r\ndrinking recycled piss.\r\n\r\nRevealing high density \"Stack and Pack\" slum developments\r\n\r\nGlobalism isn't everyone's favorite poison. It may\r\npretend to be good for your health, but it is\r\ncruel, and it leaves a very treacherous\r\nafter-taste. Globalism built a multicultural\r\nTrojan Horse for plague immigration, and we\r\nwheeled it in. The media drones and globalist\r\nlickspittles excel in ideological myopia that\r\nnever sees any wrong in pandemic immigration. Is\r\nanyone ever so stupid as to swallow the lie that\r\nthe main motive for brute-force immigration is\r\nhumanitarian concern? In these globalist days,\r\nAussies are forced to tolerate further population\r\ngrowth just to feed the real estate Ponzi scheme\r\nmonster that rages among us. Squalid little\r\nproperty racketeers are allowed to ruin our\r\ncountry and subvert democracy.\r\n\r\nSavagery of the malignant powers of mass immigration and cultural diversity\r\n\r\nYou are Australian. You are replaceable by cheap\r\nthird world flesh. And you are powerless to\r\nresist. That is the way the megalomaniacal\r\nmulticulturalist politicians want it to be. I know\r\nwhat some of you are thinking - that politicians\r\nand media drones would not lie to us about the\r\nreally big issues. In fact, it is mostly the big\r\nissues that get buried under a mountain of\r\nglobalist lies and spin. How could we bring down\r\nthe triumphalist arrogance of multiculturalism and\r\nplague immigration ?

When hearing news that Leontius wants to eliminate him, the exiled and mutilated Belisarius IV the Rhinotmetus (the slit-nose) escapes from his exile in Cherson/Sebastopol, finding hospitality among the Khazars, who attack and conquer Cherson. The Duke of Turin Regimpert and his son Aribert rebel against king Anfus of Lombard Neustria. The Franks, supporting the rebels, invade northern Italy and win the battle of Novara, after which Aribert II is enthroned in Pavia (his father died in the battle); king Anfus flees to Lombard Austrasia, where his cousin Gisulf I reigns. \n702 The Spoletan Lombards occupy Tuscany, enlarging their domains to most of central Italy. \n705 Belisarius IV, escaped from Khazaria when his brother-in-law, Khan Busir Glavan, tried to hand him over to Byzantine agents to appease Leontius, finds new friends in the Bulgarians; but when they try to help him reenter Constantinople, Leontius quickly reacts, crushing them at Adrianople and killing Belisarius on the spot. \n706 The Khmer kingdom of Chenla splits into a northern (between Laos and Siam) and southern (Cambodia and Mekong delta) half. \n707 Basileus Leontius leads a naval expedition to Africa: Tripoli is sacked, in the island of Djirva (*OTL Djerba), an obnoxious nest of Arab piracy, all Muslims are slain and replaced by Idalskan Slavs, Cibyrrheotes (a people from SW Anatolia) and Mardaites (Lebanese Christians), who also are sent to repopulate devastated Ifrigia (*OTL Tunisia). \n708 The Byzantine attempt to chase the Bulgarians beyond the Danube is frustrated by their defeat at Ankialos. Leontius rebuilds Carthage. \n709 The Arabs conquer Bokhara and Samarkand in Central Asia and invade Anatolia, defeating the Byzantines at Tiana; in Ifrigia, instead, they are trounced by Leontius at Matmata. After long pressure by Leontius, Pope Constantine bestows on the Archbishopric of Carthage the title of Primate of Africa. In Visigothic Spain King Witiza is slain whn he tries to pass the crown to his son; the (mostly) elective character of the Visigothic Crown of Spain is confirmed. \n710 The Arabs destroy the Ethiopian port of Adulis/Zula: the decaying Axumite empire, ridden with internecine strife, cannot counter Muslim encroachments along the coast.

Kutlug Bilgekul Khan founds the second Uygur khanate in Mongolia. \n740-742 A Kharijite rising shakes Libya and Egypt and is only hardly repressed by the Caliphate. 741-750 Edit \n741 The Qarluq tribal compact, together with the Uygurs, overthrows Eastern G\u00f6kturk ascendancy. In Constantinople Leo II dies, succeeded by his son Constantine V, an ardent supporter of Iconoclasm. \n742 Tiberius III dies in Syracuse; his son Leontius II has to deal with the abortive usurpation led by drungarios (admiral) Mastanarius in Ifrigia (*OTL Tunisia). The Spoletan Lombards overrun the Pentapolis (northern Marche), wresting it from the Exarchate of Adria. \n743 Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik dies after twenty years of strong rule: the Omayyad Caliphate plunges into civil war. \n744 The Uygurs destroy once and for all the Eastern G\u00f6kturk empire and impose their supremacy from the Asman Tau (*OTL Tien Shan) range to the Amur river, whilst the T\u2019ang Chinese again vassalize the Turgesh/T\u2019u-chueh khanate.

The Uygur extinguish the Western G\u00f6kturk empire too \n746 The Tibetans again invade Eastern Turkestan and destroy the town of Lijien/Alexandria, where in 40 BC a small Roman military colony had been established (the legionaries, in Crassus\u2019 army, were captured by the Parthians at Carrhae and sent in Central Asia, where they deserted to the local Xiongnu/Huns and eventually were taken by the Han Chinese) \n747 The decisive Abbasid revolution against the Omayyads starts in Khorasan when Ibrahim ibn Muhammad, from a collateral branch of the Hashemite clan, rises in revolt; upon his death in battle his brother Abu Al-Abbas as-Saffah (the Bloody) takes the leadership among the rebels, who gain wide support in Persia and Iraq. The T\u2019ang general Gao Xianzhi invades Tibet. The Uygurs defeat the Tartars along the Selenga river (Mongolia). Carloman retires to monastic life, leaving his brother Pepin the Short as the only Mayor of Palace and de facto ruler of all Franks \n750 The Abbasids decisively defeat the Omayyad Caliph Marwan II at the Great Zab river in northern Iraq, forcing him to flee to Egypt, then they conquers Damascus and exterminate most of the Omayyad clan; the Abbasid (or Second) Caliphate is thus established. Abu al-Abbas al-Saffah takes the Caliphal title for himself, despite hopes by the Shi'ites, strong Abbasid supporters during the revolution, for an appointment of their Imam (spiritual leader) Ja\u2019afar Sadiq. Though being Arab, the new Caliph crushes former absolute Arab predominance in favor of Persians and other non-Arab Muslims and moves the capital from Damascus to Kufa in southern Iraq. A Chinese invasion of Nanzhao/Yunnan ends in defeat. Gao Xianzhi leads a T\u2019ang Chinese army through Pamir up to the upper Hindukush, threatening the newborn Abbasid Caliphate\u2019s positions in both Central Asia and Afghanistan \nca. 750 During their enterprising voyages in search of uninhabited lands for hermitage, Irish monks reach Hesperia (*OTL America) and notice Iceland: the fact, largely ignored at the time and only proved by archaelogical evidence centuries later, will be hazily recorded in the Navigatio Sancti Brendani.

(AP) \" New Jersey lawmakers want to give the state's horse racing tracks a piece of the action on internet gambling. \nThe state Assembly is due to vote Thursday on a bill that would authorize tracks to offer internet gambling on their premises if they reach a partnership agreement with an Atlantic City casino or an online affiliate of a casino. \nDemocratic Assemblyman Ralph Caputo says it's a way to help the struggling racing industry with new revenue. \n\"It would bring more traffic into the racetracks, and they need it desperately,\" said Caputo, a former casino executive. \nGamblers with internet betting accounts can already place bets from anywhere within New Jersey's borders, and don't need to go to a track to do so. \n\"The casinos should realize that absolutely nothing will happen unless they agree to allow it through an agreement with a track,\" said Dennis Drazin, chairman and CEO of the Monmouth Park racetrack in Oceanport. \"Nobody is forcing anything on them. This is really a win-win for the racing industry and the casino industry.\" \nSupporters envision track patrons placing online casino bets between races. The track would be compensated by the casino for drumming up new online business; the exact amount each track would get from a casino would have to be negotiated individually. \nDrazin said tracks would set aside an area for customers to place casino bets over the internet. The tracks would be specifically exempted from state law banning so-called \"internet cafes\" that offer real-money gambling. \nThe Casino Association of New Jersey did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill. \nInternet gambling has been a bright spot in New Jersey's gambling market.

Eustace is an Iconophile, but doesn\u2019t press abolition of Iconoclasm to keep the army\u2019s loyalty \nSouthern Europe: \nKing Leo of Sicily dies without issue fighting the Idrisid invasion at the Belice river battle: a war of succession at once erupts in the areas not under Arab rule. At the Synod of Mantua a major issue is authority over the bishoprics of Histria: it is thus decided to divide the peninsula between the Patrariarchates of Aquileia (eastern part) and Grado (west), which division will remain in the centuries between Venice and the HRCEW \n827-848 \nMiddle East: \nIn this years a cultural renaissance blooms in Baghdad, with the translation of ancient Classical philosophy and science into Arab. The Abbasid Caliph al-Ma\u2019mun creates the Mihna (sort of Islamic Inquisition) to enforce his own religious views, based on Mutazilism (a rationalistic variant of Sunni Islam, with Hellenistic philosophical influences) \n828-853 \nIndia: \nMaharaja Rawal Khuman II of Mewar (northwestern India) fights 24 battles against the Abbasid armies, gaining the title of \u201cGuardian of Hinduism\u201d \n828 \nSouthern Europe: \nKing Liutpert of (northern Lombardy) dies after 52 years of reign and loyal allegiance to the HRCEW; emperor Louis the Pious installs on the throne of Pavia Liutpert\u2019s nephew Adaloald II over the deceased king\u2019s grandson, Babila. Louis the Pious also installs Hunroch II and his young son Eberhard as rulers in the march of Friul. The Venetian traders Rustico from Torcello and Bono from Methamaucs/Malamocco steal the corpse of St. Mark the Apostle from Alexandria and bring it to Rialto/Venezia, where a church will be built for him; actually the corpse stolen is not St. Mark, but Alexander the Great! (This will be discovered many, many centuries later). In Sicily the Idrisid invaders besiege and capture Palermo and sink the once powerful Syracusan fleet in the battle of Mazara \nCentral-Eastern Europe: \nThe Bulgarians conquer lower Pannonia and stage raids up to Histria; Pannonia east of the Danube becomes known as Honoguria, from the Onogur Bulgar tribe dwelling there \n828-830 \nMercia experiences a brief takeover by Wessex, then king Wiglaf frees the country \n829 \nWestern Europe: \nIn the Diet of Worms HRCEW Louis the Pious entrusts Swabia and parts of Burgundy to his last son, Charles (later known as the Bald), born from his second marriage; his half-brothers don\u2019t enjoy the news \nSouthern Europe: \nThe Idrisids rout and kill in Castrogiovanni/Enna Leontius Tyndarenus, the stronger pretender to the Syracusan throne \n830 \nCentral-Eastern Europe: \nWith Byzantine help the Khazars build the fortress of Sarkel to control the mouths of the Don river. Aydar, Khan of the Volga Bulgarians, establishes the Khanate of the Black Bulgarians in the Ukraine. Greater Moravia conquers Bohemia and enforces its supremacy over Slovakia and Galicia/Ruthenia: a new powerful Slavic empire is thus born \nca. 830 \nKing Amoghavarsha I Rashtrakuta, the paramount ruler of western and southern India, converts to Mazdaism. \nCentral Asia: \nThe Kirghizes gain supremacy over the lands between southern Siberia and Dzungaria. \nCaucasus: \nRise of the christian kingdom of Sheka in northwestern Azerbaijan 831-835 \n830-831 \nSouthern Europe: \nSuitgerus, son of duke Adalgerius of Salerno, lands in Sicily but is beaten back and barricades himself in Syracuse, which falls after a terrible siege: the Idrisids now control all of Sicily \n830-855 \nCaucasus: \nLong anti-Arab revolts drag on in Bagratid Armenia; Abbasid control over the region is severely weakened \n831-832 \nWestern Europe: \nIn the HRCEW Lothar dethrones his father Louis the Pious, discontent at the emperor\u2019s decision to give an appanage taken from his heritage to young Charles; then, abandoned by his brothers Pepin II of Aquitaine and Louis II the German, Lothar is forced to reinstall his father and wait his time, but imperial authority, especially in Italy, is jeopardized \n831-836 \nMiddle East: \nA semi-independent emirate forms in Melitene (*OTL Malatya) on the upper Euphrates. Omayyads and Abbasids vie for control of Hijaz and its Holy Cities (Mecca, Medina), with the former keeping it \n832 \nNanzhao (Yunnan) swallows his western neighbour, the Burmese kingdom of Pyu. \nWestern Europe: \nFoundation of the Visigothic county of Portugal around Oporto (known in Latin as Portus Cale, whence the name) \n833 \nThe Frankish duke of Salerno, Ademarus, vassalizes Gaeta. \nCentral-Eastern Europe: \nMojmir, ruler of Greater Moravia, conquers the principality of Nitra (western Slovakia); its prince, Pribina, takes refuge in Slavic Pannonia. \nWestern Europe: \nThe Frisian Gerulf founds on the west side of the Zuiderzee the county of Western Frisia or Kennemerland, known in later times as Holland. The Basque kingdom of Sobrarbre is peacefully absorbed by Vasconia/Navarra upon the death of its last ruler, Sancho Garc\u00e9s. \n833-863 \nWestern Europe: \nIncessant Viking/Norse raiding and a shift of the lower Rhine\u2019s course bring about the abandonment of the rich trade port of Dorestad (Holland); consequently, Frisian trade supremacy in the North Sea declines. \nca. 835 \nThe Srivijayan ruler, Patapan Sailendra of Sanjaya, re-establishes Hindu hegemony over Buddhism in Java. \nMiddle East: \nDaylam (south of the Caspian Sea) anew breaks free from the Abbasid Caliphate. 836-840 \n835-838 \nByzantine Empire: \nIn response to Abbasid raiding in Anatolia, Basileus Eustace leads successful campaigns up to northern Syria and the Euphrates \n836 \nBritish Isles: \nThe Norwegian Vikings, led by the mixed-blood Irish-Viking Godred MacFergus, conquer the Isle of Man, abandoned by king Mervyn the Freckled, who had gained the crown of Gwynedd in Wales. \nIndia: \nMihir Bhoja conquers Kanauj (central northern India, along the Ganges) for the Gurjara-Pratiharas and moves his capital there \n837 \nAn Idrisid fleet sacks Naples. \nCentral-Eastern Europe: \nThe Magyars again cross the Dnieper to western Ukraine \n838 \nWestern Europe: \nThe Venetians from Rialto sack and destroy the rival town of Comacchio, gaining permanent supremacy in the Venetic Exarchate (whose ruler keeps, though, the title of Doge, Duke). On the death of his son Pepin I, Louis the Pious bestows Aquitaine on Charles the Bald, which fact reopens never healed wounds in the Carolingian dynasty. \nByzantine Empire: \nThe Abbasid army counterinvades Anatolia and inflicts a grave defeat upon the Byzantines at Guziliurta, then takes and razes Caesarea Esusebia in Cappadocia \nBritish Isles: \nWessex invades Cornwall, but the latter gets reinforcements from Brittany and repels the invaders \n838-842 \nFar East: \nThe power of Tibet is severely curtailed by the fierce civil war that puts Buddhists and followers of the traditional Bon religion one against the other \n838-846 \nBritish Isles: \nA massive Viking invasion of Ireland, led by Thorgest, shatters for some years the succession of the Irish High Kings \n839 \nBritish Isles: \nThe Norwegian Vikings of the Orkneys, in alliance with the Scottish prince Kenneth MacAlpin, kill king Eoganan of the united house of Fergus, ruling both Dalriada and Alba; Kenneth\u2019s father, Alpin, is enthroned in Dalriada, while Ferach mac Bargoch, a relative of Eoganan, manages to secure the Pictish throne of Alba. In England, Sussex is de facto annexed by Wessex. \nWestern Europe: \nAt Worms Louis the Pious, having recently died Pepin of Aquitaine, revises the future division of the HRCEW Empire between his sons: Charles the Bald will gain the whole territory west of the Rh\u00f4ne and Somme rivers, Lothar will receive the imperial crown of as Holy Roman Catholic Emperor of the West plus the central territories of Provence, Burgundy, Rhineland, Flanders (soon collectively known as Lotharingia, whence Lorraine) and suzerainty over Italy; the German territories east of the Rhnine will be Louis II\u2019s domain. Ranulf I becomes count of Poitou, founding the dynasty of the same name \nSouthern Europe: \nIdrisid pirates from Sicily leak into the Adriatic Sea, defeat the Venetians and sack Ancona. The Bulgarians expand in Macedonia and Serbia under khan Malomir (their first ruler to bear a Slavic name). \n839-840 \nCentral-Eastern Europe: \nThe dethroned prince of Nitra (Slovakia), Pribina, ascends the throne of the Slavic Duchy of Pannonia, by now known as Balaton, a vassal of the HRCEW \n839-841 \nCentral Asia: \nThe prince of Usrushana, Afshin Khaydar ibn Kawush, a general in the Abbasid army, rises in rebellion but is betrayed and deported to Samarra (Iraq), where he is starved to death in jail \n840 \nWestern Europe: \nHRCEW Louis I the Pious is finally deposed by his sons and dies in a monastery a broken man. Aquitaine, who should go to Charles the Bald according to Louis I\u2019s will, rebels under Pepin II, son of Pepin I, hailed as king by local feudatories \nSouthern Europe: \nAn Idrisid fleet takes Taranto, whose duke Roland had headed north to uphold his favoured candidate, Lothar, for the imperial succession; the Idrisids establish there a Muslim emirate. Idrisid fleets also sack the coastal cities of Dalmatia and extort tribute from the Sardinian judicates. Meantime Naples rebels against duke Fulmar of Salerno and chooses as its new duke Sergius from Cuma \nByzantine Empire: \nGeneral Melissinos gains a brilliant victory against the Arabs at Daranaseia and temporarily conquers Melitene (*OTL Malatya). Idrisid pirates from Cyrenaica first choose as their base the island of Chalki near Rhodes, then, expelled by the Byzantines, assault and conquer Heraklion in Crete making it a harbor for Muslim piracy with the name of al-Khandaq. \nFar East: \nThe second Uygur Khanate in Mongolia is overthrown by Khakassians, Khirghizes and Qarluqs, who destroy the Uygur capital, Kara Balghasun. \nCentral-Eastern Europe: \nThe Khazars vassalize Kiev and install there the Magyars under voivoda (prince) Olom. The latter will call western Ukraine Lebedia, from their chieftain, Lebedias \nca. 840 \nCentral Asia: \nThe Turks begin the process of Islamization. In western Kazakhstan dwell the Oghuz, while the Qarluqs are splitting into Kimaks (in southern Siberia) and Kipchaks (in the northern Central Asian steppes). \nNorth Africa: \nSt. Cyprian of Constantina finally Christianizes the northern Zenete Berbers of the desert. \nMiddle East: \nThe Abbasid Caliph of Baghad al-Mu\u2019tasim creates an army of Turkic slaves (the Ghulams, later known as Mamluks) to counterbalance the rival factions, and particularly the dubious loyalty of the powerful Daylamite mercenaries. \nCentral-Eastern Europe: \nPiast the Wheelmaker, from the Slavic tirbe of the Polanians, founds the kingdom of Poland, centered in the Posen-Gniezno area. 841-845 \nSummary: Idrisid ascendancy in the Mediterranean, the Carolingians carve the empire after a civil war, the Lombards are finally tamed \n840-847 \nCentral Asia, Far East: \nPushed ahead by the victorious Khirghizes, the Uygurs migrate en masse in the Tarim basin area of eastern Turkestan, permanently destroting Tibetan supremacy in the area. In time many of them will convert to Buddhism, already followed by the local Indo-European Tocharians, who are finally absorbed and disappear as a distinct culture. The Chinese T\u2019ang emperor Wuzong, an ardent Taoist, persecutes all other religions: Buddhists, Zoroastrians, Manichaeans and Nestorian Christians \n841 \nWestern Europe: \nFighting soon breaks out between Lothar and Pepin II of Aquitain on one side and Charles II the Bald and Louis II the German on the other: it\u2019s the Carolingian war of succession. Lothar and Pepin\u2019s forces are defeated at Fontenay (near Auxerre). \nSouthern Europe: \nLombardy falls in chaos when Babila kills king Grimoald III and rejects Frankish overlordship: some Frankish dukes support his bid for independence, others, notably duke Unroch II of Friul, do not and resist harshly. \nByzantine Empire: \nThe Council of Thessalonica finally condemns Iconoclasm and reimposes Nicene Catholicism at Byzantium \nSouthern Europe: \nThe Idrisid invaders of Puglia take Bari, where they set up another emirate \nBritish Isles: \nThe Norwegian Vikings found Dublin, pillage and subdue a sizable chunk of eastern Ireland \n841-843 \nWestern Europe: \nTaking adavantage of the Carolingian war of succession the Vikings mount a vast pirate attack against the Frankish kingdoms: they plunder Rouen and Nantes and forever destroy Quentovic (on the Channel\u2019s coast just opposite Kent) \n842 \nWestern Europe: \nThe Oath of Strasbourg seals the alliance between Charles the Bald and Louis the German against Lothar and attests the birth of the French and German languages. The Visigoths of Spain, taking advantage of the Carolingian war of succession, reject Frankish overlorship and try to subdue Vasconia/Navarra but are heavily routed by marquis Siguin II \nSouthern Europe: \nIn Lombardy the independentist faction led by the usurper Babila overcomes the loyalist dukes at the battle of Corteolona, near Pavia \nNorth Africa: \nConstantina resists a long Idrisid siege; it preserves independence and Christianity, though at the price of vassalage to Tunis \n843 \nWestern Europe: \nThe Treaty of Verdun divides the HRCEW in three parts and, by an irony, confirms Louis the Pious\u2019 will at the last Diet of Worms. Charles III the Bald gains Carolingia or West Francia (France proper) with Pepin II as sub-king in Aquitaine, Louis/Ludwig II gets East Francia/Germany, Lothar the imperial crown plus Lotharingia (Burgundy, the Netherlands, Provence, Rhineland), overlorship over Romancia and a pledge by his brothers to help him in the reconquest of Italy, to be made another Frankish kingdom for Lothar\u2019s son Louis \n844 \nSouthern Europe: \nThe Frankish army, united for the last time, storms into Lombardy through allied Romancia (*OTL eastern Switzerland and Valtellina) and annihilates Babila\u2019s army at the battle of Castelseprio, thus forever ending Lombard power in northern and central Italy; even duke Berengarius of formerly independent Spoleto, having supported Babila is forcibly deposed and replaced with the Frank Guido I. Lothar\u2019s son, Louis, is crowned in Rome by Pope Sergius II as Louis I of Italy (and later Louis II as emperor). The Idrisids, now masters of the central Mediterranean, take the sea-trading towns of Gaeta and Amalfi, where they establish two local emirates; duke Fulmar of Salerno moves against them but is defeated and captured and will end his days as a slave \nWestern Europe: \nDuke Bernard of Septimania is executed on orders of the king of West Francia Charles III the Bald (five years later his son William will meet the same fate); the Judeo-Christian Duchy thus reverts to the Eastern Frankish crown, but the region will remain a hotbed of unorthodox feeling and a world center of Jewry for centuries. \nByzantine Empire: \nThe Byzantine fleet briefly retakes Heraklion /al-Khandaq on Crete, but the Arabs rapidly oust the imperial forces \n845 \nNorth Africa: \nThe Berghawata general Simon of Arzaya repels the last Visigothic attempt to conquer Mauretania by king Theodoric V, defeated and killed in the failed siege of Ulili, the Maurian capital. \nWestern Europe: \nDuke Nomino\u00eb\u2019s Bretons heavily defeat the Western Franks at Redon and regain full independence; meantime a Danish Viking fleet led by king Ragnar Lodbrok plunders northern France, conquers Paris itself and extorts rich tributes from Charles the Bald. \nBritish Isles: \nThe Vikings conquer Limerick in Ireland and establish a local kingdom there. \nCentral-Eastern Europe: \nBorivoi I becomes duke of Bohemia under Greater Moravian suzerainty, thus establishing the Premyslid dynasty. 846-850 \n846 \nSouthern Europe: \nThe Idrisids conquer Naples, then fiercely sack Rome itself. St.Peter\u2019s is set ablaze and Pope Sergius II is martyred on the spot, then Guido I of Spoleto with a crack force chases away the Arabs. All of southern Italy is now in Muslim hands. \n847 \nSouthern Europe: \nThe new Pope Leo IV the Great and Louis, Lothar\u2019s son and king of Italy, fortify Rome against further Muslim aggression, Louis turns them on the Idrisids retaking from them vast swaths of southern Italy, but is unable to retake the coastal cities, lacking a fleet on par with the Muslim one. \nBritish Isles: \nKenneth mac Alpin, king of Dalriada, tries to eliminate the Pictish royal family but is killed by Drust IX MacFergach of the MacFergus dynasty of Alba, which now comes to rule also the Scots; from now on Dalriada/Scotland and Alba will remain two distinct kingdoms in personal union under a single king. \nWestern Europe: \nThe Vikings sack Bordeaux, which gives herself from Aquitaine to Charles III the Bald\u2019s Western Francia for protection. \n848 \nMiddle East: \nThe Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil quits the Mihna (a sort of Islamic inquisition) and leaves the intepretation of the Q\u2019uran to the Sunni Council of the Ulema, who proceed to elect a Wali, or supreme guardian of the faith; in time this figure will gain the prestige of a Sunni Islamic Pope. Meanwhile, the Shi'ites are still persecuted and non-Muslims suffer strong discrimination. \nBritish Isles: \nThe Irish defeat the Vikings at Cork, freeing the town. \nCentral Asia: \nBalkh (northern Afghanistan) gains independence under the Bani Juris. \n850 \nSouthern Europe: \nA second Idrisid assault against Rome is routed at the battle of Ostia by Louis II, who is afterwards anointed as coemperor of his father Lothar by Pope Leo IV. \nCentral Asia: \nKol Bilge Kara Khan founds the Qarluq-Uygur Karakhanid clan in Transoxiana (Central Asia). Pan Tegin/Mangri establishes the Uygur kingdom of Turfan in eastern Turkestan. \nWestern Europe: \nRurik, son of the duke of the Abodrites (Slavs of northeastern Germany) Godoslav and maternal nephew of duke Gostomysl of Novgorod, but raised among the Danes in Frisia, conquers Dorestad, the capital of Frisia. \nNorthern Europe: \nThe Norwegians of Vestfold are ousted from Vendeyssel (the northern \u201ctip\u201d of Jutland). \nBritish Isles: \nCornwall counter-invades Wessex with Viking help, but the Saxons win at Hingston Down. \nca. 850 \nIndia: \nThe Gurjara-Pratiharas unify most of northern India under Mihir Bhoja, blocking the expansion of the Abbasid Caliphate and his successor states.

that all law enforcement agencies should act together in the fight against corruption 09:31, 7 December 2017 Voice of America \nThe United States Federal Bureau of Investigation cooperates with the Ukrainian National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) within the limits defined by the Memorandum of Understanding signed in June 2016. This is stated by FBI in response to Voice of America news agency inquiry. \n\"In June 2016, the FBI and NABU adopted a Memorandum of Understanding, which allows the FBI to assist NABU and the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAP) in the investigation .The FBI adheres to the laws of Ukraine and never works outside a certain Memorandum of Understanding, \"the FBI said in a statement. \nThe FBI also notes that their officers work in the NABU on a temporary, rotational basis in order to support the relations between the parties. \n\"These special agents and analysts are not operational, any statements about the opposite are false,\" the FBI said. \nIn addition, the agency notes that the eradication of corruption is a priority for the FBI and they are constantly working with their partners in law enforcement agencies around the world to investigate corruption and provide assistance when they are asked to. \nLater, the FBI added that \"In the fight against corruption, all law enforcement agencies should work together.\" \nAs it was reported earlier the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine performed an illegal act when it asked for the FBI assistance while searching the State Migration Service office. Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General said that in his interview. \nPreviously, Head of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau Artem Sytnyk reported that the FBI helped them investigate the cases of corruption in the State Migration Service and illegal production of amber. \n\u2018Artem Sytnyk said it was a joint operation of the NABU and the FBI. If that\u2019s true, I have a question \u2013 who actually let the foreign special service act in Ukraine?

The current level of the shares currently stands at 46.59 at the time of writing. \nThe main usage of the Parabolic SAR is for trailing stops and exit points. The principle of trading using this indicator is easy. A long position should be maintained as long as the indicator is moving above the price levels, whereas a short position \u2013 while it is below them. In addition, when the SAR changes its direction and crosses the price levels, not only the current position should be closed, but it is suggested that the opposite one should be opened at the same price levels. \nHowever, it should be used only when the market has the defined trend (around 30% of the time) and is smoother. When the trend is absent or the market is volatile, this system generates a lot of incorrect signals. Moreover, the indicator should be adjusted depending on the characteristics of the underlying shares. \nInvestors may be trying to get an edge by following current technical levels for Continental Resources (CLR). In terms of Moving Averages, the 50-day is 41.69, the 200-day is at 39.00, and the 7-day is 47.03. Using a longer term moving average such as the 200-day may help block out the noise and chaos that is sometimes created by daily price fluctuations. In some cases, MA\u2019s may be used as strong reference points for finding support and resistance levels. Employing the use of the moving average for technical equity analysis is still highly popular among traders and investors. The moving average can be used as a reference point to assist with the discovery of buying and selling opportunities. \nContinental Resources (CLR)\u2019s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R currently sits at -54.18. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would point to an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would signal an oversold situation. The Williams %R was developed by Larry Williams. This is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator. \nContinental Resources (CLR) currently has   21.29. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \nCurrently, the 14-day ADX for Continental Resources (CLR) is sitting at 31.48. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would support a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would identify a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would lead to an extremely strong trend. ADX is used to gauge trend strength but not trend direction. Traders often add the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to identify the direction of a trend. \nThe RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a widely used technical momentum indicator that compares price movement over time. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. The normal reading of a stock will fall in the range of 30 to 70. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued.

A certain stock may be considered to be on an uptrend if trading above a moving average and the average is sloping upward. On the other side, a stock may be considered to be in a downtrend if trading below the moving average and sloping downward.

The current level of the shares currently stands at 7.33 at the time of writing. \nThe main usage of the Parabolic SAR is for trailing stops and exit points. The principle of trading using this indicator is easy. A long position should be maintained as long as the indicator is moving above the price levels, whereas a short position \u2013 while it is below them. In addition, when the SAR changes its direction and crosses the price levels, not only the current position should be closed, but it is suggested that the opposite one should be opened at the same price levels. \nHowever, it should be used only when the market has the defined trend (around 30% of the time) and is smoother. When the trend is absent or the market is volatile, this system generates a lot of incorrect signals. Moreover, the indicator should be adjusted depending on the characteristics of the underlying shares. \nIn terms of Relative Strength Index for Petro Matad Limited (MATD.L), the 14-day RSI is currently noted at 58.33, the 7-day is 66.02, and the 3-day is sitting at 68.43. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a very popular momentum indicator used for technical analysis. The RSI can help show whether the bulls or the bears are currently strongest in the market. The RSI may be used to help spot points of reversals more accurately. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder. As a general rule, an RSI reading over 70 would signal overbought conditions. A reading under 30 would indicate oversold conditions. \nIn terms of CCI levels, Petro Matad Limited (MATD.L) currently has   98.50. Investors and traders may use this indicator to help spot price reversals, price extremes, and the strength of a trend. Many investors will use the CCI in conjunction with other indicators when evaluating a trade. The CCI may be used to spot if a stock is entering overbought (+100) and oversold (-100) territory. The 14-day ADX is presently 18.45. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX reading over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A level under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available. \nInvestors may be studying other technical indicators like the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. The Williams %R is a momentum indicator that helps measure oversold and overbought levels. This indicator compares the closing price of a stock in relation to the highs and lows over a certain time period. A common look back period is 14 days. Petro Matad Limited (MATD.L)\u2019s Williams %R presently stands at -52.58. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would indicate an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would indicate an oversold situation. Looking at some moving average levels, the 200-day is at 14.50, the 50-day is 6.76, and the 7-day is sitting at 6.98. Moving averages can help identify trends and price reversals. They may also be used to help spot support and resistance levels. Moving averages are considered to be lagging indicators meaning that they confirm trends. A certain stock may be considered to be on an uptrend if trading above a moving average and the average is sloping upward. On the other side, a stock may be considered to be in a downtrend if trading below the moving average and sloping downward.

I mean they have just taken things to the next level and the extremes. \nI tried researching for a few of them and guess what? I found a bunch of them and some of them made me very uncomfortable and disgusted. Also, not a lot of them made any valid point of their existences. \nHere, have a look. \nP.S. Beware, some images down under are not for the faint-hearted. 1. Teeth Sharpening \nHuman teeth sharpening is a manual sharpening of human teeth, where usually the front incisors are sharpened. Historically, it was mostly done for spiritual purposes, but in modern times, it is a form of body modification that mainly has a decorative purpose. 2. Neck Rings \nIn many tribes across the world, neck rings have been an important part of many traditions and rituals. To elongate their necks, tribal women wear decorative neck rings that push their collarbones and ribs further down, twisting them eventually at an angle of 45 degrees, way lower than what is natural. It looks very painful and I\u2019m sure would be too. 3. Tongue Splitting \nTongue Splitting is also famous as tongue bifurcation or forking. It\u2019s a type of body modification in which the tongue is cut centrally from its tip to as far back as the underside base. While some people do it to increase sensations when kissing, others include novelty, spirituality, and the desire to connect with one\u2019s body. 4. Corset Piercing \nCorset piercing is probably the most painful body modification in which a person\u00b4s back is pierced multiple times mostly side to side and then laced up like a REAL corset. Most corset piercings are intended to be temporary, due to the pain and risk of injury they impose. READ ALSO: Group of Death!

Magnetic Implants \nThis is for those who like to wear different decorative objects on their bodies but would not want to get pierced every time. Once the magnet goes under your skin, you can pick up any metal object and attach it to your skin easily without any pain. 6. Human branding \nIt also goes by the name stigmatising; it is the process in which a mark, usually a symbol or ornamental pattern, is burned into the skin of a living person, with the intention that the resulting scar makes a permanent decoration. Really, what the f#*%? 7. Corneal tattooing \nCorneal tattooing is a body modification in which the cornea, is permanently tattooed. Why would someone go through this one? 8. Eye ball tattooing \nSo, guess what? The cornea is not the only part of an eye that can get tattooed. The white of the eye can also be modified where some people have ornaments tattooed right on their eye balls while others choose to change the colour entirely. 9. Subdermal Implants \nThe subdermal implant is a method of body modification in which little objects, usually made from silicon or Teflon, are implanted under your skin, which creates impressions upon the skin. This process is also known as a 3-D implant or pocketing. 10. Lip Window \nWhile eyes are said to be the windows to the soul, your lips can be a window as well. Lip piercing is one of the most common types of piercing and to make this piercing even more striking, some people stick a transparent pyrex plug in the hole instead of a ring or stud.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "business owners arrested in lagos state", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:48.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e3addc5e3b821806e2180ff71568018010f02f23", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSD5YCTmlNBdUdfVMiy8NZYqF0XRzCNytm_NoRj1OxrbxcybQDLvjYwXlNV6nOqjh65I0FnLj7tbjYjWQVGmS1Qi4rmQI6u0h7uX4fSYDrNkbOX4BdRGwlx0s7a1vQNhVX2bWWebT5UShqvEVWLuDgQUH0A1EuTP5A-", "site_full": "yahoo.uservoice.com", "site": "uservoice.com", "site_section": "https://yahoo.uservoice.com/forums/382977/filters/new?page=2", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "tech"], "section_title": "Finance: New (1044 ideas) \u2013 Yahoo Feedback", "title": "12.1.17 Problems throughout on getting prior day's closing data correct on summary pages", "title_full": "12.1.17 Problems throughout on getting prior day's closing data correct on summary pages \u2013 Yahoo Feedback", "published": "8839-12-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.uservoice.com/logo/design_setting/110199/original/yahoo-logo.png?1394026197", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3828, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e033f8d6ac6b0644771428b2495e242ec584bcba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSD5YCTmlNBdUdfVMiy8NZYqF0XRzCNytm_NoRj1OxrbxcybQDLvjYwXlNV6nOqjh65I0FnLj7tbjYjWQVGmS1Qi4rmQI6u0h7uX4fSYDrNkbOX4BdRGwlx0s7a1vQNhVX2bWWebT5UShqvEVWLuDgQWqjGK_F3bDLmHXGOh9ANcA--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Charles Blaine", "published": "2017-12-03T21:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "If you want the screenshots, let me know.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:48.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2a9998b4b490b1c2ed9a39752291cbffdc647282", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqvnrJwRthBKEEcomq02VbdNXhxNTCxSFh0PU811JpClaDlOFWiJvN4pZL2VzfOC7z9qDP55KkuGv.N3MN8fuLoGC5qFsSHU4Op8FCLPZb8BZH0uOuYr0IwpAoJgj9qXEE-", "site_full": "timeofgist.com.ng", "site": "timeofgist.com.ng", "site_section": "http://timeofgist.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Timeofgist", "title": "Nigerian Man Reveals How He Used A Lady To Set Up And Catch Thief Who Stole His Phone in Lagos (Photos)", "title_full": "Nigerian Man Reveals How He Used A Lady To Set Up And Catch Thief Who Stole His Phone in Lagos (Photos)", "published": "2017-12-07T09:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i1.wp.com/timeofgist.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Nigerian-Man-Reveals-How-He-Used-A-Lady-To-Set-Up-And-Catch-Thief-Who-Stole-His-Phone-in-Lagos-Photos-2.png?fit=696%2C350", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2a9998b4b490b1c2ed9a39752291cbffdc647282", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqvnrJwRthBKEEcomq02VbdNXhxNTCxSFh0PU811JpClaDlOFWiJvN4pZL2VzfOC7z9qDP55KkuGv.N3MN8fuLoGC5qFsSHU4Op8FCLPZb8BZH0uOuYr0IwpAoJgj9qXEE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Macprince", "published": "2017-12-07T09:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Nigerian Man Reveals How He Used A Lady To Set Up And Catch Thief Who Stole His Phone in Lagos (Photos)", "text": "Nigerian Man Reveals How He Used A Lady To Set Up And Catch Thief Who Stole His Phone in Lagos (Photos) By \nA Lagos-based artiste identified as Ayo Bishi, has taken to the social networking platform to share the story of how he caught a guy who stole his phone after he set him up with a lady.\u2019 \nHere\u2019s how the story was narrated on social media by the artiste; \n\nThis guy stole my phone on Sunday and dissapeared and he went ahead to pick my calls and afterwards turned the phone off , the next day I went in search of his number and I found it, and then I told a lady to call him after true caller told me his name is Abbey and the lady called him but he didn\u2019t disclose his location but he was curious to know the lady calling so he kept calling and I told the lady not to pick the call. \nNext thing he called with another number and I immediately checked for the number on Facebook and I found out the owner of that number is a lady schooling in Tasued so I decided to check her pictures , and also checked for the guy with the highest comment on her posts, then I waited for about three hours more before I called the number and I pretended to be the guy from her Facebook immediately she fell for the Trick and she disclosed her location Ijebu ode Tasued, Ijaagun. \nI had to travel immediately to Ijebu ode that same evening I got there at about 10, Pm and I went straight to their school Authority to file. A Report and i requested for Security Personnel to aid in getting the Arrested cos I know once I get the girl I ll get the guy too . \nThirty minutes later after proper documentation , I called the girl and she noticed my Voice was different from the person i told her I was so I told her it\u2019s cos of the phone I was using to make the calls so she decribed her hostel. \nOn getting there I saw a very pretty Fair lady and I asked her not to be afraid if she co operates with me she ll have nothing to worry about , so I asked her for Abbey, and she said he already left for Abeokuta I was so pissed off I gave her a dirty slap (which I apologized afterwards for) and I told her she is surrounded.

Previously, the Maine-based singer-songwriter played with O\u2019Death and Blood Warrior, and his debut solo album possesses similar dark and eerie qualities as seen through the lens of traditional folk and layered over synths and electronics. \nThe record creates a dense atmosphere, combining the mysterious with the pastoral and calling to mind snowy New England winters below swirling, distant constellations. There is depth within Jamie\u2019s lyrical focus, which takes on everything from disappointment to adventure to mental illness. Crazy Time can be equally enjoyed while trudging through the snow or cozied up next to a fire, and the entire LP possesses a unique wintery beauty. \nARTISTdirect caught up with Greg Jamie to discuss his debut solo album, inspiration, and chopping garlic. \nRead the rest of the interview at ARTISTdirect Interviews \"Like\" ARTISTdirect on facebook to get more news and info on Greg Jaime", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "greg jaime vocalizes", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jamie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg jamie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o\u2019death", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg jaime", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "artistdirect interviews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "artistdirect", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:48.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9de8f5b831a5dd6685ae27e2ef99dcc8ad7c77ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kNOYMWIthylTUGkFjTM60jqqdDuDF8RIySalSOB_msJyJ3CzPwBeqBGfYU0.x3yfcNjTDh39JZl8_HpKonQgVx2DHX8XZNzDa88X6KT.TlwwpgRjFZQF99Ei3FO5t4YekHurmxkUhuvZrcOGHpJEjhjDBdQaVBnI0jpqWROQ5quAmRLfKivD5", "site_full": "www.independent.co.uk", "site": "independent.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "The Independent - News", "title": "No deal Brexit threatens \u00a34.8bn architecture industry, says report", "title_full": "No deal Brexit threatens \u00a34.8bn architecture industry, says report | The Independent", "published": "2017-12-06T23:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/06/16/pa-30436430.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 568, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e7bfbedc82c6b3c8f1718352c5508c04dcf7e1ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kNOYMWIthylTUGkFjTM60jqqdDuDF8RIySalSOB_msJyJ3CzPwBeqBGfYU0.x3yfcNjTDh39JZl8_HpKonQgVx2DHX8XZNzDa88X6KT.TlwwpgRjFZQF99Ei3FO5t4YekHurmxkUhuvZrcOGHpJEjhjDBdQaVBnI0jpqWROQ5qpD10aRmIq.uR0PVjVD5C6I-", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "Dujma", "published": "2017-12-07T13:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Arups", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:40:48.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e3addc5e3b821806e2180ff71568018010f02f23", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSD5YCTmlNBdUdfVMiy8NZYqF0XRzCNytm_NoRj1OxrbxcybQDLvjYwXlNV6nOqjh65I0FnLj7tbjYjWQVGmS1Qi4rmQI6u0h7uX4fSYDrNkbOX4BdRGwlx0s7a1vQNhVX2bWWebT5UShqvEVWLuDgQUH0A1EuTP5A-", "site_full": "yahoo.uservoice.com", "site": "uservoice.com", "site_section": "https://yahoo.uservoice.com/forums/382977/filters/new?page=2", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "tech"], "section_title": "Finance: New (1044 ideas) \u2013 Yahoo Feedback", "title": "12.1.17 Problems throughout on getting prior day's closing data correct on summary pages", "title_full": "12.1.17 Problems throughout on getting prior day's closing data correct on summary pages \u2013 Yahoo Feedback", "published": "8839-12-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.uservoice.com/logo/design_setting/110199/original/yahoo-logo.png?1394026197", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3828, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a775f60d4beae73953feb29c29bda7ef0affc689", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSD5YCTmlNBdUdfVMiy8NZYqF0XRzCNytm_NoRj1OxrbxcybQDLvjYwXlNV6nOqjh65I0FnLj7tbjYjWQVGmS1Qi4rmQI6u0h7uX4fSYDrNkbOX4BdRGwlx0s7a1vQNhVX2bWWebT5UShqvEVWLuDgQD7UESnzC19wsHNPPC7RHAg--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Charles Blaine", "published": "2017-12-03T21:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "To give you an idea how how bad the data was on Friday, here's a spreadsheet of the Dow close, the change, % change and listed prior close.

However, organized government has only existed for two million, while the race has only been united for around a million and a half years. FTL travel was discovered around a million years ago. The Centrians have adapted to many different situations, allowing them to use every single system they come across. By using floating cities over Gas Giants and brown Dwarfs, they get the energy they need - from Fusion - and grow food in hydroponics facilities. However, their most populous world remains the Capital, Corufrey, around seven times the size of Earth. Also known as the Crystal World, due to crystal being a Centrian building material, and those they have completely built over the globe. Despite this, few species have been wiped off their world. Many exist in underground facilities or off world. Centrians, despite their appearance of similarity to humanoids, actually have a completely different digestive, reproductive, skeletal, respiratory, and nervous system than humans and, in fact, Eukarya in general, instead belonging to the domain Syarasi. \nThe Centri have fought in nine major wars throughout their existence, listed here in chronological order. The First Dalexi War; Minor role; Result, defeat; Extinction of the Habara. The First Morntruo War (AKA Aranjan Emergence War); Major role; Result, victory; Extinction of the Sinfata. The Second Morntruo War; Major role; Result, strategic loss; Extinction of the Gabarji. The Second Dalexi War; Major role; Result, victory. The Fourth Galactic War; Minor role; Result, stalemate. The Fifth Galactic War; Minor role; Result, victory. The Third Morntruo War; Major role; Result, victory; Extinction of the Aranjans and Gargarians. The Sixth Galactic War; Minor role; Result, victory; Extinction of the Dalexi. The Seventh Galactic War; Major role; Result, ongoing. First Dalexi War Edit \nThe First Dalexi war occurred not long after the unification of the Centri, approximately nine million years ago. The Centrians played a relatively minor role in the war, mainly supplying troops and aid to the larger Sinfata and Habara civilizations in the war. The war originally looked like the Allied powers would win, but quickly fell apart as tensions between the Sinfata and Habara allowed the Dalexi - a violent, horrifically genocidal race - to make a comeback, ravaging through several noted Centri and Sinfata worlds and totally destroying the Habara. The Habara civilization, and race, died a few hundred years later, refugees on Sinfata and Centri worlds. First Morntruo War Edit \nThe first war in which the Centri played a major role, also known as the Arnjan Emergence war, took place approximately 8.5 million years ago. The Aranjans, a fierce and expansionist race who desired to enslave or kill all others, emerged swiftly, in mostly empty space under the control of the Sinfata. In less than a year, they had reached- and destroyed- the Sinfata homeworld, just as a coalition was forming, led by the Centri, to stop them. After 18 brutal battles, centered on the Centriad system of Morntruo, on the border of the Aranjan territory, the Aranjan fleets were finally broken at the battle of Kalmenshu, and were destroyed, to disappear back into the Sinfata Cluster, where they could not be detected. It is estimated that between 30-60% of the population of the area was destroyed by this war. Second Morntruo War Edit \nThe peace did not last long, though, and a mere 300,000 years later, the Centriad were plunged into war again, as the Aranjans reemerged near Gagarian space. Despite fervent efforts to halt the Aranjan troops, the Gagarians were eventually defeated, and their homeworld captured. The Centri and allies continued fighting for another 37 years, but finally halted the war. The Gargarians would later be wiped out by the Aranjans during the Third Morntruo war. Before the Aranjans were pushed back into the Cluster, they also wiped out the Gabarji. Though the Aranjans were all but destroyed in this war, their quick rate of rebuilding, and the fact that they effectively destroyed all of the Centri's allies, and nearly wiped out the Centri themselves, killing almost 65% of them. Second Dalexi War Edit \nAnother 3.5 million years passed in peace until the Second Dalexi War, sparked by the Dalexi's brutal genocide of 700,000 Gabarji on a ship passing through Dalexi space. The Centrians supported the Gabarji as they declared war, but were unable to prevent their subsequent total destruction. However, this mobilized the forces of the other races in the region, and the resulting war- massively destructive as it was- sealed the place of the Centri as the most powerful race in the region. The Dalexi were defeated and forced to give up large swaths of space. Fourth Galactic War Edit \nThe Centri played a very minor role in this war, sending troops to the Grand Alliance, along with supplies and such. Although they officially declared war on the Pact of Stars, no Centrian fleet or battlegroup ever actually battled a Firstborn ship in this war.

Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. \nThe president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. \nOn Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box \u2014 although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. \nSteve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. \nObservers were divided on how to score the president's action. \n\"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" \nBut Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" \nA host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. \nBut after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. \nAn email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" \nCritics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \n\"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \nAaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" \nTrump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" \nThe president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. \nDuring a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" \nTrump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \n\"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\" \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Initial deaths estimated at 40 million. What is left of the UK government structure at local level instigate the \"Emergency Powers Act\". \"If at any time it appears to Her Majesty that any action has been taken or is immediately threatened by any persons or body of persons of such a nature and on so extensive a scale as to be calculated, by interfering with the supply and distribution of food, water, fuel, or light, or with the means of locomotion, to deprive the community, or any substantial portion of the community, of the essentials of life, Her Majesty may, by proclamation (hereinafter referred to as a proclamation of emergency), declare that a state of emergency exists\" \nIt would seem that the population has or will fall to a minimum of 11 million. Authorities state that no efforts are made to bury the dead as the majority of the surviving population is too weak for physical labour. Burning the bodies is considered a waste of what little fuel remains, as is using fuel to power bulldozers in order to dig mass graves. Millions of bodies are left unburied throughout the UK, which leads to the outbreak of diseases such as cholera and typhus. \nInitial reports across Ireland estimate that the first strike against Belfast had killed in excess of 550,000 people with casualties in the region of over 100,000. Refugees heading south and west to the republic number in excess of 200,000. The early UK death estimates can only be guessed at around 40 million. The population of the Scottish Islands stands at 60,000 with the provisional capital being designated as Stornaway on the Isle of Lewis. \nIn addition, casualties from radiation fall out and long term sickness have added considerable burden to the formative years of the Alliance. Each county or burgh reported continued and increasing deaths from radiation with the population of Ireland alone falling from 3.5 million to just over 2.5 million through sickness and starvation. \nBelfast as the main target on the island has seen the greatest destruction. The city was wiped of the map with huge numbers of casualties, nevertheless, like many cities and towns in the western UK notably in northern Ireland and Scotland the hilly geography reduced the over all impact on the wider countryside. This allowed large numbers of those in the suburbs of Belfast to escape, it also believed that large numbers in the periphery of the city of Glasgow due to its geography may have escaped though it was a prime target for over three missiles, there is still doubt if all three reached their target due to the number of refugees from Glasgow reaching the Islands. Glasgow was the third largest UK city and close to nuclear military facilities on the River Clyde. Consideration is being given to mounting an expedition to Glasgow when radiation levels drop to a palatable level. Birth of a Celtic Alliance Edit Gordon Wilson M.P. \nThe Irish government after talks with the northern counties and remaining UK MP\u2019s agreed to formal alliance to ensure effective democratic government of the remaining populated areas, though still claiming rights over the rest of the U.K. The formal alliance was signed by the Irish President Patrick J Hillery, Mayors of the Northern Irish Counties and Gordon Wilson (SNP) MP Privy Councillor of the UK, formally establishing the Celtic Alliance as a democratic successor state to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (Eire). This was signed on the 20th March 1986 on the spring equinox symbolizing Celtic rebirth and renewal. \nThe government has suffered many set backs in its initial attempts to provide basic food and supplies for the general population, yet there has been little civil unrest. The population seemed fully aware of the monumental task facing the country as well as the alternative to government action being anarchy. The principle concerns relate to contaminated supplies and the militaries ability to maintain supplies across the new alliance. \nLimited local elections are held to appoint mayors (Ireland) and provosts (Scottish Islands) to the main areas of population to enable some form of government and legal representation in each area. The Catholic and Protestant churches in both Ireland and Scotland unify to ensure community cohesion. Most of the Northern Irish Protestants stayed out of this union (The majority of Scots, or what is left have rejected this idea and have embraced the Alliance governance project), and since the late 1980's over 90% of them have left for the Realm of New Britain, tempted to emigrate by generous land grants under the Whitelaw government, as well as the cleaner air and healthier lifestyle and their continuing loyalty to King Andrew. Many Northern Irish Protestants found that on arrival in New Britain that life was harsh and was fettered with the legacy of colonial rule. Evolving calls for a more indigenous South Africa are causing many to reconsider their allegiance to the British Crown, which in reality fled the U.K. leaving the nation and its survivors to fend for themselves, the monarchy is a non-issue to the Alliance population. \nSince 1993 the President of the Alliance has been the former lawyer Mary Robinson and the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) was Andrew Welsh a former Scottish Nationalist MP. Andrew Welsh retired in 1999, the present Taoiseach is Adam Price who won a landslide victory in 2009. \nThe initial provisional Alliance government from 1984 to 1986 was based on the Irish Republic model (as the Republic had the largest population numbers this was seen as only fair by the other participants. Nevertheless, in 1986 new elections to a new Parliament were held with smaller numbers of MP's. Each MP is also the county Mayors of Ireland and Island Provosts from Scotland, Manx or the Isle of Mann though still having a provincial parliament appoints a commissioner to represent it in Dublin as does the Channel Islands. recent additions include Mayors from England, Channel Isles, Brittany and Normandy The Rest of the Decade Edit Belfast on the day of attack \nFurther contact was established with the remnants of some Scottish western Islands as well as Orkney and Shetland, in addition EOC's have continued to relay information from various parts of the U.K, though EOC's are few and far between due to the surprise attack. In addition small expedition forces on the fringes of the toxic UK mainland noted utter devastation and the complete breakdown of the rule of law. The western Scottish Islands began to form militia and with the assistance of the government in Dublin who agreed to military posts to protect the islands from sporadic raids by marauders from the mainland. In addition landings were made in Oban to build a refugee 1st stage camp. The camps role is to co-ordinate the relief effort and ensure that those in dire need of medical attention receive at least basic pain relief as well as enabling healthy survivors to reach the Islands \nInitial radiation patterns have reduced contact with the rest of the world to zero, with the Alliance considering that the majority of the globe having entered a period of complete social meltdown. The government maintains martial law and initiates the fuel and food laws to maintain supplies to agriculture and food production; formal discussions at government level begin lay the principle agreements for the Celtic Alliance. Mass starvation is still a great worry, though vast swaths of land have been turned over to food production even public parks and areas on the seashore. The Scottish Islands come under further stress by the influx of refugees from the greater Glasgow area especially from the north of the city. The refugees tell of mass death and destruction with marauding hordes across what is left. There are reports of cannibalism and emerging feuds as well as mutated births. Radiation sickness is the main killer in the Alliance \nInitial aerial reconnaissance over Liverpool and Glasgow found fortified groups of survivors in encampments in each city, contact has been limited to food and medical supply drops in the Liverpool area. Radio contact has been made with Glasgow, numbers of survivors is now estimated to be in the thousands. Due to the high levels of radiation in eastern Scotland and southern England the use of drones has been limited. \nFuel: Due to Scotland\u2019s high oil reserves small oil platforms on its western fringes have been put into full production. Though smaller than those in the North Sea, which were destroyed they nonetheless are helping greatly in maintaining basic supplies to what is left of the population. Nevertheless, draconian laws have limited the use to purely agricultural, military and medical use \nFood: Given Ireland and Scotland\u2019s histories with famine, it has been of no surprise to the population for the need to cut back on food consumption. All arable land has been turned to cultivation of diverse crops with a marked reduction in meat production. Further to this the western fringes of Ireland and Scotland have once again become havens for the re-emerging fishing industry though much of the waters are heavily polluted. Nevertheless, food production is limited and the general population has become increasingly concerned about the raise in cases of starvation in the main centres of population. Fish production is stepped up as is the usage of the humble potato. \nFood policy 1983 - 1995: Those who work get more food than those who don't and the more people die, the more food there is for the rest. \nThe Celtic Alliance is formally constituted during the spring equinox of 1986 on the 20th March (Using traditional timings the government hope to maintain some notion of history for the new nation) bringing to an end the UK founded in 1707 and the Irish Republic declared in 1922, yet strangely it brings back under one nation the Isle of Ireland and Scotland as was under the old Celtic Kingdom of Dalriada. Nevertheless, the new Alliance also claims sovereignty over the UK and dependencies with legitimation from the former UK MP's, and it is hoped to re-establish some form of legitimate government in the future on the rest of the British Islands. The last two years have seen profound change in the Isle of Ireland, Scottish Islands, Isle of Man and Channel Islands with starvation and death on a biblical scale. Nevertheless, in a interesting twist just like the Celts of the dark ages, they have used their Celtic ingenuity and a their ability to invent to develop structures which have maintained the structure of government and ensuring that entire communities work to restore some vestige of civilization to the European fringe. The onset of the nuclear winter is not as bad as many predicted but the nuclear summer is a profound awakening for the usually cloudy nation. The population work the fields either in the early morning or late evening and if needed cover completely to work during the day. A major boost to the population is the maintenance of the primary education system, enabling parents and carers to work in the production of food as well as maintaining an educated workforce for the future. \nIt becomes clear that the three missiles that targeted Glasgow did not all reach their target, with one missile reaching the nuclear base on the river Clyde, the western fringes of the city and towns notably Greenock, Clydebank and Dumbarton receive heavy damage. Nevertheless, the majority of the city remains intact. Contact with Dublin is restored and long supply lines are started via Oban as the lower Clyde is contaminated. Glasgow formally appoints a new Senator Provost (as opposed to OTL Lord Provost) who will sit in the Dublin Parliament. The Senator Provost is Jim Sillers a well known trade unionist and Scottish Nationalist. 1992 -1993- First Contact Edit \n21st January 1992 a ham radio signal is received from the Azores re-establishing contact with the outside world. \nOctober 1st, 1993 The new Celtic Alliance government formally welcomes the Nimitz to Galway the port city of the Alliance. Bringing much relief to the beleaguered government and hard pressed population. Discussions begin in Canberra about the legal right of British dependencies and former colonies with the New Celtic Alliance. The Alliance though in no way wishing to become a global power asks for time to deliberate on the impact of giving up sovereignty on the populations so socially and historically connected to the old UK especially the Falkland Islands & Gibraltar. The remainder of the U.K. naval operations in the Island are transferred back to Galway with several naval ships notably HMS Hermes making its way to the Alliance after spending time under ANZC command. The Alliance asks for plebiscites in each area dependency and seeks to maintain a neutral role hoping most colonies will choose new alliances or strike out on their own. \nFormer U.K. diplomats in ANZC become the official voice of the new Alliance at the League of Nations discussions, nevertheless, the Alliance feels compelled to replace the British & Irish Ambassadors who died in the initial attacks on Australia as soon as possible with a new appointment; a prominent former Scottish Nationalist Alex Salmond is appointed. Further contact is established with Brazil and Australia. Formal relations are agreed upon and the Nimitz returns to Australia with the Alliance's 1st ambassador. Welsh Periphery \nRecovery missions across the Welsh coast in the early 1990's identified large numbers of survivors. The majority coming from the coast, notably Pembrokeshire, Anglesey, Conway, and Ceredigion. \nThe whole of Wales became part of the Celtic Alliance in 2002. Southern England Edit \nFrom the early 1990's Celtic Alliance medical teams continue to investigate areas around London and the counties of Kent and Sussex establishing medical bases and strategic commands to enable better delivery of food and supplies. \nInitial population estimates range between 200,000 to 600,000 with law and order being a major problem particularly in Kent. Armed militia continue to harass medical services, though local designated police forces are starting to gain the upper hand over lawlessness. The appointed head of the interim County and appointed interim M.P.is Paul Carter. \nIn 1992 the Celtic Alliance assisted the newly formed Confederation of Wight and Hastings in the removal of a dictatorship from the town of Worthing in West Sussex. \nAt Christmas 1992 the Confederation was dissolved and the Federal Republic of the Isle of Wight and Sussex (or Southern England) is formed. \nFrom the year 2001 the reliance of the Republic on the Celtic Alliance slowly ebbed away as the nation grew and became self reliant. \nFrom 2005 the majority of Celtic Alliance troops had been withdrawn leaving only medical personnel and engineers, as Celtic trained Republic troops and police forces took over the law and order of the Republic. 1993 - A shipping nation again Edit \nGalway becomes the principle staging post for missions to mainland Europe as well as the main ship building port of the alliance, many survivors from both Belfast and Glasgow the great shipping cities play a major part in rebuilding the alliances communication via shipping along its coast lines (in a twist of fate this was why the ancient celtic kingdoms where often called the sea kingdoms). Nevertheless, due to lack of supplies most of the limited numbers of ships are built from recycled materials and are used primarily to maintain contact between the main centres of population. It will take another 20 years before the Alliance in conjunction with the Nordic Alliance agree the terms of a European Navy that will assist the European states to reach further into mainland Europe with the necessary supplies for relief. Life Choices - 1993 Edit \nSubstantial losses in life continue to effect the recovery of the new alliance, though population numbers stabilize around 2m. The state passes the \"Abortion (Eire) Act\" 1993 to deal with the amount of births with profound deformities caused by radiation and pollution, the act is contested in the supreme court by religious groups and liberal pro-lifers who due to the war now defend human life at all costs but passes in to law making abortion legal in Ireland for the 1st time. Liver bird takes flight Edit \nAfter the initial contact with Liverpool in 1995, the Alliance continues to send supplies to the main settlement in Birkenhead. The main sections of the city have been hit by a high yield atomic bomb on its northern edge, this has allowed refugees to pour over the River Mersey to Birkinhead. \nIn the October of 1995 the city is formally reconstituted with its temporary HQ being based in Birkenhead, the authorities assume the Liver Bird symbol which sits atop the Liver Building on Liverpool's waterfront as the city's new symbol. The 1st election to the Parliament in Dublin takes place on Thursday November 2nd, the hotly contested election is won by Paul O'Grady a Drag Queen known as Lilly Savage, he wins by a landslide on a ticket of anti-corruption, human rights and good financial management. Mayor O'Grady MP also has a keen interest in agriculture and sets about diversifying the local economy based on local produce and fishing. \nWhen the first democratic elections took place Merseyside and western Cheshire joined the Celtic Alliance. \nThe population of the city stands at 12.000, with over 708,000 known to have perished through the initial blast and subsequent radiation sickness and starvation Yorkshire Coast Main article: Kingdom of Cleveland \nDuring a fishing trip from off the east coast of Yorkshire in 1997 a small Celtic Alliance trawler comes across a cobble (small open fishing boat) longline fishing. \nThe two crews make contact and the Scots discover that the two Atomic bombs aimed at the Tees Valley missed one hitting 7 miles north east of the intended target, off the coast of Hartlepool, the other 12 miles south of the target over the North Yorkshire Moors. The towns in the Tees Valley were exposed to large radioactive fallout blown inland by the prevailing winds causing many tens of thousands of deaths. One survivor of note is Princess Anne (only daughter of the former Queen Elizabeth II) \nThe Kingdom of Cleveland is due to vote on a referendum on becoming part of the Celtic Alliance on 21st May 2010. However popular opinion is that the Kingdom of Cleveland will remain independent. \n28th May 2010 \nAt 10am the results of the referendum on the Kingdom of Cleveland joining the Celtic Alliance. The vote was as follows: Yes - 17% No - 83% \nthe voter turn out was 78%. \nPrime Minster Mallon makes a statement at 11am, that the people of Cleveland had spoken, but just because the vote had been no, that trade relations were just as good as before the referendum. \nIn early 2010 the governments of the Kingdoms of Cleveland and Northumbria approached the Celtic Alliance with the possibility of linking the countries by a rail line. \nThe line currently travels north from the former county of Yorkshire and stops at Berwick upon Tweed but surveys north along the line show that the Forth Bridge is still relatively intact and with some repairs will be possible, the main problem is with putting a rail line through the heavily irradiated remains of Edinburgh. However the Kingdoms have experience of building lines through irradiated areas having put a line through the bombed out remains of the Tyne and Wears valleys in the mid 2000's.On the 29th March 2010 five engineers working on the former east coast mainline are killed by a derailment caused by a landslide across the tracks just north of Berwick. Ongoing repairs should mean that the line will between Berwick and Glasgow in late 2010, and between Berwick and Fife (across the Forth Rail Bridge) sometime in late 2011. \nThe first train linking the Kingdoms of Cleveland and Northumbria with the Celtic Alliance in Glasgow arrives in Glasgow main rail station on the 13th November 2010. New London \nNew London was founded in 1987 in the former Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire. The Mayor is a former civil rights worker Diane Abbot. \nNew London became part of the Celtic Alliance in 2002. Mayor Diane Abbot of New London In addition to medical supplies and militia development in the south east, commanders have sought to rebuild connection to the communities near the obliterated landmass of London. \nInitial research has identified various communities even in the outskirts the city, though there are large areas of radiation. Due to limited medical supplies in the immediate aftermath of DD radiation related illness is a major and debilitating factor of life for many. In addition, only now are the majority of births not affected by dreadful debilitating conditions and deformities. \nThe Alliance government issues the following declaration to retain political control of the south east. \n\u201cIn so much as this Alliance is the heir of the former Irish and British States and is imbued with their powers and rights, we the people restate our right and duty to maintain the freedom, liberty, community, security and dignity of these Islands by appointing the Interim Mayor of the City of London, with all the powers that this Parliament sees fit to retain the said rights of the Alliance and maintain the dignity of the people.\u201d \nThe first elections in New London took place in 2000 with Interim Mayor Diane Abbott winning with 68% of the vote she was proclaimed Mayor on the 23rd October 2000. The New Millennium Edit \nIn 2004, the Parliament in conjunction with the WRCB begins the formal count of survivors inside contaminated areas, in addition to initial contact over the last 10 years medical staging points are bolstered by supplies from ANZ. Highest levels of radiation are being measured in Greater London, Manchester, Portsmouth, Southampton, Plymouth, and Birmingham. \nMedical staging points: MSP's have been in operation since 1987, with the first being placed in Oban. They have proved useful in restoring contact with communities and individuals as well as offering medical and food supplies to contaminated areas. \nAs well as providing medical aid MSP's offer the opportunity for life ending, via ECC's (End Cycle Centres), these centres offer a pain free method of euthanasia. Highly contentious, these centres are often only to be found at the outlying MSP's and never near the main centres of population. The church and a vocal minority are opposed to the centres with early centres being destroyed in civil disorder. \nIn 2007, the Atlantic Defense Community is founded, which is constituted of what remains of the old NATO powers commit to cooperating militarily in the present and future. The Atlantic Defense Community is established. It includes what is now Spain, Portugal, the Celtic Alliance, the Nordic Union, and Canada. The Alliance appoint LT GEN D EARLEY as the Alliances Command representative based in the Azores. 2009 General Election Edit \nIn 2009, the incumbent Taoiseach Mark Cosgrove tries to hold together the Dalriadic Party in the face of a political fall out with the Kingdom of Cleveland and the pressure of the new left of centre Celtic Democratic Bloc. Its leader Adam Price is social progressive making huge strides in the heartlands of the Daldriadic Party notably Scottish Islands, Armagh and the Welsh districts. The Bloc is denouncing the old political elite and demands changes to the constitution for devolution to the Alliance members given the huge international political changes sine DD. \nThe Bloc is leading in all polls and is in position to be the largest party in the Dublin Parliament, though it will have to form a coalition Retrieved from \" http://althistory.wikia.com/wiki/History_of_the_Celtic_Alliance_(1983:_Doomsday)?oldid=1507029 \" Ad blocker interference detected!

The 14-day RSI is presently standing at 60.15, the 7-day sits at 67.31, and the 3-day is resting at 67.40. \nInvestors may be watching other technical indicators such as the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. The Williams %R is a momentum indicator that helps measure oversold and overbought levels. This indicator compares the closing price of a stock in relation to the highs and lows over a certain time period. A common look back period is 14 days. International Paper Company (IP)\u2019s Williams %R presently stands at -14.84. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would indicate an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would indicate an oversold situation.

But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
