It should be distinguished from recycling, which is the breaking down of used items to make raw materials for the manufacture of new products. Reuse \u2013 by taking, but not reprocessing, previously used items \u2013 helps save time, money, energy, and resources. In broader economic terms, it can make quality products available to people and organizations with limited means, while generating jobs and business activity that contribute to the economy. \nBuy my Gears  My Camera = http://amzn.to/2xFR890 My Tripod = http://amzn.to/2gsGYAO My mobile = http://amzn.to/2exSTA4 My second mobile = http://amzn.to/2wweRbg My lights = http://amzn.to/2xFv8uH My second light = http://amzn.to/2exRvh5 My Lens = http://amzn.to/2iR8BaT My laptop = http://amzn.to/2xEVSLy My glue gun = http://amzn.to/2eOkpGv My Memory Card For DSLR = http://amzn.to/2esHuxP \nSubscribe my Channel= https://goo.gl/mVoBUi \nDIY Craft lovers can also follow Artkala  on - \n\u2605 FACEBOOK: https://goo.gl/GhsN9S \u2605 \n\u2605 :Blog : https://goo.gl/34zBnQ \u2605 \n\u2605 TWITTER: https://goo.gl/9ZqMep \u2605 \n\u2605Youtube: Youtube.com/artkala \u2605 \n\u2605 Google+ : https://goo.gl/JCpgAq \u2605 \n\u2605 Instragram : https://goo.gl/bHcRaq \u2605 \nChannel description Hey guys, Welcome to the world of innovation Artkala.

The server admins need to be the ones that have the options to choose what they would like to do if the new master server goes down or if they even want to use it as we have already moved past needing one with the nwnx plugins and nwnscripts to secure your server without the need of one.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:08.067+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4dab821e1e9b8c94f880b488a6048b18e8019213", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ4u_1mO3PFHWoR2r.awtAIRA9p8xyIgSJgPgvYWyqLW4p1OsulPhlYM9NyfcbDh9F2odoJHPgtmaZamUqtATss", "site_full": "forums.beamdog.com", "site": "beamdog.com", "site_section": "https://forums.beamdog.com/categories/nwn-persistent-worlds-multiplayer", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Persistent Worlds &amp; Multiplayer \u2014 Beamdog Forums", "title": "Authentication hooks", "title_full": "Authentication hooks \u2014 Beamdog Forums", "published": "2017-11-23T08:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 70392, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f1aecb4e3227e1051ab7606270f4e3182740584", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ4u_1mO3PFHWoR2r.awtAIRA9p8xyIgSJgPgvYWyqLW4p1OsulPhlYM9NyfcbDh9F2odoJHPgtmRz.sOmtfvCle8Jn8z267Wk-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "BlessedAdversary", "published": "2017-12-02T10:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I'd also be interested in what Beamdog thinks about this.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:08.070+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "812d8bed1970822cee7de253e3fb96f2352d114d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzZTDPhGhY5DMzhoZ0w86k_Ej4pxh19z9oW3bXf_0kfLKahlemQ.io328B9b5MpCRH3bMxDKiiQdKUBWnaY1.t0L9tOXCZMquhgqvZ1USg_Bn_R2YrtQbvbjvNudI12yaM-", "site_full": "forums.roadbikereview.com", "site": "roadbikereview.com", "site_section": "http://forums.roadbikereview.com/forum.php", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "scuba_diving", "sports", "home_video_dvd", "tech", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting"], "section_title": "Road Bike, Cycling Forums", "title": "Domane or Madone?", "title_full": "Domane or Madone?", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31460, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ff345fbac3ce0dabbbf6dff12ff1e2c94c363fa4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzZTDPhGhY5DMzhoZ0w86k_Ej4pxh19z9oW3bXf_0kfLKahlemQ.io328B9b5MpCRH3bMxDKiiQdKUBWnaY1.t0L9tOXCZMquhgqvZ1USg_Bn_R2YrtQbvbwgI7TJJlKHNQTs.Yccy8dCgg5oWPg.ZW", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "BCSaltchucker", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "what about any of the fifty other similar models and brands out there??

Each Republican other than Senator Bob Corker (Tennessee) voted in favor of the bill, and each Democrat voted against the bill. The next step in the legislative process will be to reconcile this bill with the version passed by the House on November 16, which differs from the Senate bill in a number of significant ways. Both chambers are expected to vote this week to go to a conference committee to work out a final bill. December 6, 2017 Now that the Senate bill is finalized, we wanted to note several key amendments made to the Senate bill in the final days and hours before passage, including: Like the House bill, the final Senate bill would allow an itemized deduction for up to $10,000 of state and local real property taxes. The earlier Senate draft bill would have repealed the deduction for state and local taxes completely. The final Senate bill would retain the individual AMT, although with increased exemption amounts, and the corporate AMT. The increased threshold for the individual AMT would phase out gradually, returning to the present-law exemption levels after the 2025 taxable year. The Senate draft bill would have repealed both the individual and corporate AMT, as would the House bill. The final Senate bill would allow for temporary 100% expensing of capital expenditures through 2022, with the expensing percentage decreasing by 20% every year thereafter. The draft Senate bill would only have allowed 100% expensing through 2022, without the subsequent phasedown. The final Senate bill would increase the deduction for passthrough \u201cqualified business income\u201d from 17.4% in the Senate draft bill to 23% (reducing the effective tax rate for passthrough income to 29.6%, subject to the wage limitation). The final Senate bill would increase the tax rates for the deemed repatriation of untaxed foreign earnings to 14.5% (on cash and cash equivalents) and 7.5% (on all other earnings). The \u201cChairman\u2019s Mark\u201d originally proposed rates of 10% and 5%, respectively. These new rates are the same as those in the House bill. The final Senate bill would phase in the proposed rule to limit interest deductibility for disproportionate allocations of debt to U.S. members of a multi-national group, applying an initial \u201cdebt-to-equity differential percentage\u201d of 130% for taxable years beginning in 2018, which would then decrease by 5% points annually, ending at 110% for taxable years beginning in 2022 or later. The draft Senate bill would have instituted the 110% figure beginning in 2018. The final Senate bill would increase the base erosion minimum tax (a minimum tax calculated on a base equal to the taxpayer\u2019s income determined without tax deductions or other tax benefits arising from certain \u201cbase erosion\u201d payments) from 10% to 11% for certain financial institutions. In the final Senate bill, the 1.4% excise tax on the net investment income of certain large private college and university endowments would only apply to colleges and universities with an asset-per-student threshold of $500,000 (rather than $250,000 in the draft Senate bill and House bill), and schools that do not participate in federal financial aid programs would be exempt from paying the tax.

(ABC News: Leonie Mellor) The embattled LNP leader Tim Nicholls is again refusing to concede he has lost the Queensland election, despite Labor winning its 48th seat. The ABC's election computer has awarded the knife-edge seat of Townsville to sitting Labor MP Scott Stewart over the LNP's Casie Scott.That gives Labor a more comfortable majority of 48 seats over the LNP's 39.In his victory speech this afternoon Mr Stewart said he won by 214 votes. Contacted by the ABC today, the LNP again refused to concede defeat, and said the party was waiting on results from other north Queensland seats.Mr Stewart said it was clear the LNP could not form government. \"I think Tim Nicholls should stand up, make that phone call, and concede today,\" he said.\"It's a very clear message now from the people of Queensland about what their preference is, 48 seats going to Labor.\"I'm sure [Annastacia Palaszczuk] is waiting on a phone call from Tim Nicholls to concede. Whether he will do today, it's up to Tim to decide that.\" Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has yet to claim victory, 12 days after Queenslanders went to the polls.The Greens this morning secured their first win at a Queensland election, claiming the seat of Maiwar.The LNP's ousted member Scott Emerson conceded defeat last week but Labor and the Greens' Michael Berkman had been fighting it out on preferences.The LNP had initially been well ahead on primary votes, but lost what was a blue ribbon seat on the distribution of preferences abc", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott emerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael berkman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott stewart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leonie mellor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "casie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim nicholls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stewart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "annastacia palaszczuk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "labor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lnp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greens", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "townsville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queensland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:09.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "06a2acc7bda7541a858959e92779e66d96d070c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPXuU32CXJj63_CT0aV6ik3GFdNch.2bFdP.H25UhQP83pPbySlL_45BVAEs6Id8TzZ45ufCYSzpRMJT_fr3MWI0ualnXaX9_pmtzAjvr9pNN", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g294453-i1554-o80-Croatia.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Croatia Forum, Travel Discussion for Croatia - TripAdvisor", "title": "sailing in June 2018- cabin charter x2 people - Croatia", "title_full": "sailing in June 2018- cabin charter x2 people - Croatia Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-11-23T23:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.392, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4cc2465d3c9264fb6d09ca58c7cbd54e118511d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPXuU32CXJj63_CT0aV6ik3GFdNch.2bFdP.H25UhQP83pPbySlL_45BVAEs6Id8TzZ45ufCYSzpRMJT_fr3MWI0ualnXaX9_phlcOrpWchcnSd2G6wHgw50-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "world_citizen_53", "published": "2017-11-28T13:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Do you mind me asking what age you both are?

Both projects will modernise existing systems and increase overall efficiency. \nThe TARGET2-T2S consolidation will provide market participants across the Eurosystem with enhanced liquidity management procedures. The consolidated system is expected to be launched in November 2021. This follows a public consultation in which market participants helped to define the user requirements. \nThe Eurosystem Collateral Management System (ECMS) will provide a harmonised platform for collateral operations across the Eurosystem and will replace the existing systems of the 19 national central banks for those functions which can be harmonised until the launch. The ECMS will allow changes to the existing collateral framework to be implemented in a harmonised way across the euro area. The launch is planned for November 2022. \nThe Deutsche Bundesbank, the Banco de Espa\u00f1a, the Banque de France and the Banca d'Italia will act as service providers for both projects. \nFor media queries, please contact Lena-Sophie Demuth, tel.: +49 69 1344 5423. \nECB - European Central Bank published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:06:03 UTC . \nOriginal document http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2017/html/ecb.pr171207.en.html \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/CF85250438BFC0AE38E83E749CFB66A9688D4A35", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lena-sophie demuth", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ecb european central bank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ecb - european central bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european central bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banca d'italia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eurosystem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banco de espa\u00f1a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche bundesbank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eurosystem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banque de france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:27:09.046+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6fa76c4627affae44a10844acac2fa9c7fe204f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspam6JRnFFrnY0.WbJjRs.t2GRC4W1y8BPG_TxcAZo.GhnI2Bh.6gc8RnXZp6iJiz.6Y873_2Nj.AIn5jupla.hFmUl7FR529cb", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/Manhattan-Hoteis.d129440.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Manhattan: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "Park Central Hotel New York:", "title_full": "Park Central Hotel New York: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-11-28T03:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e92300fd025f4d36534566bc52248651c3c91bce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspam6JRnFFrnY0.WbJjRs.t2GRC4W1y8BPG_TxcAZo.GhnI2Bh.6gc8RnXZp6iJiz.6Y873_2Nj.AIn5jupla.hFtSFlvkPXpZlE1trWflTGYjL.ImZ4PEjUzCJn3EXeSo4", "ord_in_thread": 12, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-05T01:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Check in process was smooth- hotel bellmen and doormen were awesome- front desk staff were unfortunately not as friendly.

(WPVI) -- The reaction to the President Donald Trump's announcement recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was swift.On the Jewish side the reaction was profoundly joyous, something many believe should have been done a long time ago. While the reaction from Arab Americans was the opposite.Action News caught up with several people Wednesday night attending a lecture at the Kaiserman Jewish Community Center who support the embassy move.Devorah Selber said, \"It was for me like the Declaration of independence again.\"Elkana Barreitan said, \"I think we're all very excited, we're very happy, I heard a friend say that it felt almost like a declaration of independence that may be a bit exaggerating.\"\"It's something that was meant to be, so we just needed a President with some guts to move into Jerusalem and make it one,\" Ariela Yankelewitz said.Those at the JCC were attending a lecture given by Israel's most decorated athlete and Olympic medalist, Arik Zeevi who lives in Tel Aviv.\"I'm pretty happy, I think it's about time. Jerusalem is our capital since I was born and I think it's about time the U.S. will acknowledge it, and all the world will acknowledge it,\" Zeevi said.But Marwan Kreidie, the President of the Arab American Association and a professor at West Chester University, had a completely different view.Kreidie said, \"It destroyed all attempts of the U.S. being an honest broker in the Middle East. Since the 1940s, the United States decided Jerusalem should be shared by everybody.\"Kreidie believes not only does the move set back any efforts for real peac,e but will incite violence.\"What we'll see is also increase the anti-American feeling in the Middle East. We're gonna see more American deaths because of this, you're gonna have people who will attack the U.S,\" Kreidie said.And that's what some Jewish Americans worry about.\"Makes me very happy, but my children will be traveling to Israel next week and that makes me nervous,\" said Shirlee Peretz, supporter of the embassy move.But others believe the peace process has been stalled for decades as the move may be a game changer.Supporter of the embassy move Ben Barnett said, \"I think this a big change in the peace process, so I think that there's a new idea here, a new way to look at it.\"There were a wide view of opinions on moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, senior White House officials say the move will not be immediate, but will unfold over the years.
