There's $10,000,000 worth of vehicles there, and he apparently didn't start collecting in earnest until he was retired.\nNow I STRONGLY suspect that he's a \"cray fisherman\" in the same way that George Barber was a \"Dairy Farmer\". Barber inherited the family milk business (good luck to him!) and sold out for enough to build the Barber Motorsports Center and amass the Barber Museum collection, i.e. something north of eight figures in good ol' USD.\nI'm wagering that Grandpa Bruce \"Gator Thumper\" Boyd founded a family seafood empire back in the day, and Ian worked in the family business for years (perhaps on a boat fishing, perhaps not) and when the business came to him in the natural course of time, retired, started a trust fund, and has been keeping himself happily busy with old bikes and cars since.\nBelieve me, I know what a man can buy with a reasonable retirement from a good satisfying career, and it doesn't consist of rows of Vincents disappearing off into the distance like rows of corn in an Iowa field !\nLannis\nAmerica's great!

The days of big money are gone now I believe. This is as opposed to crayfish that live in dams (crawdads, or in Oz , 'craybobs').\nAttached photos in order: 1) crayfish of the money making kind (official name: rock lobster), 2) freshwater crayfish of the kind that lives in dams and creeks - grows to maybe 8\", 3) Murray River crayfish AKA freshwater lobster - grows big obviously.\nNo reason at all to be confused about what a crayfish or lobster is\nLannis has it right. a 'fleet' of crayboats would bring you big dollars.\nAttached Files Last edited by BrizzoBrit; 06/10/17 12:27 am .

It means we'll have to charge another dollar to the consumer for each concert ticket or each package we deliver, but you provide a lot of value and it's worth it to us, we think it'll be good business ...\"\nAre ANY of us going to say \"No, I don't want to double my pay, it would be too hard on the consumer to pay the extra so that I can have it.\" ? ANY of us? No, never.

Scott Barbour / Getty Images Members of Parliament celebrate at Parliament House on Thursday in Canberra, Australia, after the approval of same-sex marriage. Michael Masters / Getty Images \nAustralia's Parliament has voted to approve same-sex marriage following a protracted and often bitter debate that was finally settled in a nationwide referendum last month that overwhelmingly backed the move. \nIn the capital Canberra, applause welled up from the House gallery after the chamber on Thursday followed Australia's Senate in approving the Marriage Amendment Bill of 2017. \n\"What a day! What a day for love, for equality, for respect! Australia has done it,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a speech following the vote. \n\"It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect,\" Turnbull said. \"This belongs to us all. This is Australia \u2014 fair , diverse, loving and filled with respect for every one of us. This is a great day \u2014 it belongs to every Australian.\" \nAustralia's Attorney-General George Brandis described the vote as \"a truly historic moment.\" \nThe country's first gay marriages are expected in January, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. \nWhile the votes were not immediately tallied, in the House of Representatives, it was clear that 130 to 140 members of parliament voted \"yes,\" according to the Herald . With the Senate last week approving the legislation by a 43-12 margin, Australia becomes the 26 th country in the world to allow same-sex marriage nationwide. \nTurnbull has been an advocate for the change all along, in contrast to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a vocal proponent of traditional marriage. \nAs the Herald reports: \n\"While gay rights campaigners have fought for marriage equality for decades, the direct path to Thursday's vote began two years ago when the former Abbott government announced it would settle the question of same-sex marriage by a public plebiscite. \nMr Turnbull continued that policy, but it was blocked by opponents in the Senate. The government later opted to hold a voluntary postal survey asking: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'\" \nNovember's mail-in referendum , while technically non-binding, was approved by 62 percent of registered voters and ensured that the parliament would take up the measure. \nThe Associated Press notes: \n\"The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nExisting civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer.

These labels are the most economical in price but still allow the business to identify their employees. Have a look at the following article taking us through the subject Reusable blank name tags for identity.\n\nThere is a small space, but for some dogs, there is a lot that should be said. Try to break it down to the pet's name, your house address and zip code and any medical/dietary issues which need to be considered when someone else may come to handle your dog. If it is possible, try to add your telephone number too, in the biggest text available. It is worth considering the bigger labels if you need more space to fill in information.\n\nThis can give you a running history to document how your trip progressed. It makes a great way to outline your vacation itinerary on a layout. Empty scrapbooking calendar pages are also fun for longer events, such as a school year. You can add pages for the month the child entered school with a picture of his or her first day, a page for things like the holidays, and so on.\n\nBy adding the calendar pages you get an idea of when things happened, rather than just having a picture of your child in the snow or playing at a park. Filling an entire year of void calendar pages makes an instant year-in-review album. Try finding empty pages that are the size of your album, like 12x12. Then just slip the pages into an album at the end of the year.\n\nThis style fastener as well as bull dog swivel clips attach easily and are mostly used for attaching to shirt collars, pockets, sleeves, or belts and do not puncture fabrics. Pocket protectors slip down with ease onto the top of a pocket and are primarily used by men because of clothing choice. The best form of advertising is sometimes as simple as having a walking advertisement.\n\nAn easy way of identifying your electronic devices either in the home or office is by using these cable tags in different colors. These are available in various brands sold by online dealers, and they securely attach to cables of various cables. You can also avail of the larger size printed or blank ones. All details such as the size of the tags are provided on the website.\n\nThe individual squares for each day can be designated for photos, embellishments, and journaling. You don't have to limit yourself to a white background either. Attempt replicating the month onto decorated cardstock. Vary your design by tilting the calendar on the page, or placing it off center.

Merkel herself has previously hinted that fresh elections would be preferable over governing alone.\nMerkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister-party the Christian Social Union (CSU) won 33 percent of the vote back in September's elections, their worst result since 1949. Coalition talks between Merkel, the liberal party and the Greens collapsed, throwing the spotlight onto the the center-left Social Democrats (SPD). The SPD has previously governed with Merkel's party in a \"grand coalition\" but seemingly wanted to stay in opposition and rebuild after a bruising election result.\nMaurizio Gambarini | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel attends a press conference in the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany on July 05, 2017. Nonetheless, the SPD is holding a three-day congress this week and will ask members' permission to start coalition talks with the Conservatives. A poll published by the German Spiegel newspaper showed that only 28 percent of SPD voters favoured another grand coalition, though 57 percent of them argued leader Martin Schulz should support a minority government led by Merkel.\nThough Schulz has said at the start of his campaign that he would not join a coalition with Merkel, he has been under pressure from the German president to find a compromise with the Conservatives and avoid the need for fresh elections.\n\"One thing is for sure, she, Angel Merkel will lead the next government, no matter if it's a grand coalition again or perhaps a minority government,\" Spahn told CNBC.\nHe believes that coalition talks with the Socialists could start next week, if the party members decide that direction, but these won't be finalized until the end of February or even the start of March.\n\"I hope we can start next week, with small talks with some party leaders, (but) then there's Christmas,\" he said, \"so I guess in January we will have the biggest part of the talks of the negotiations, then the SPD will want to ask their members, so that needs two to three weeks, so I think it will be end of February or even March before we know that there is a new coalition for Germany.\"\nshow chapters Migration and investment biggest issues in Germany, analyst says      3:54 AM ET Thu, 7 Dec 2017 | 02:35 Despite the political impasse since the general election in September, the German economy seems to be totally isolated from it, according to Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING. Data released on Thursday showed industrial production dropping 1.4 percent month-on-month in October, after falling 0.9 percent in the previous month. On a yearly basis, industrial production was still up by 2.7 percent, from 4.2 percent in September.\n\"In our view, and as strange as it might sound, the October drop is simply the result of public holidays and long weekends. All soft and hard indicators actually point to a strong surge in industrial production in November,\" Brzeski said in a note.\n\"The irony of today's drop in industrial production is that it probably reflects the strength and not the weakness of the German economy.

have a purpose with every interaction you have . \n13) Keep in touch with past clients. \nIf you haven\u2019t heard from or contacted a client for a long-time, find reasons to reconnect and establish the relationship again. \n14) Accept rejection as a normal part of the sales cycle. \nYou\u2019ll never get a sale from every call, so don\u2019t expect it. \nInstead, recognise that some people will not be ready to buy now, and work on getting in touch when they are ready. \n15) Practice your prospecting calls with your colleagues or your manager. \nThey will be able to give you constructive feedback in a safe environment. \n16) Improve your listening skills outside of the sales calls. \nYou know you need to listen effectively, so practice those skills in situations where it\u2019s not vital. \nThat way, you will find it easier to adapt when you\u2019re in front of prospects. \n17) Don\u2019t sound desperate in sales meetings . \nAs soon as you start sounding needy, you lose credibility and the prospect will start to take advantage of that. \n18) Recognise that buyers have access to much more information than ever before. \nSo you need to understand their needs and how your products fulfil those needs. \n19) Remember that buyers don\u2019t buy your products or services; they buy the results   give them. \nSo concentrate on proving those results rather than going over the features and benefits all the time. \n20) Concentrate on building value in your solutions , rather than how good your products are. \nHigher value will impress your prospects much more than cheaper products \n21) Technology is changing the buying cycles of buyers, so build your knowledge of all the technological advances in your industry. \nThis will change very quickly, so remain up-to-date as much as you can. \n22) Know more about your competition than your customers do. \nYou don\u2019t want to be embarrassed when a customer tells you about special offers from competitors before you know about them. \n23) Have a process for asking for referrals . \nMost salespeople leave asking about referrals until the client offers them. \n24) Become a valuable resource to your clients . \nSending them interesting articles, downloading podcasts that will interest them, holding coaching sessions for their employees and keep them up-to-date with industry news and views will help you become valuable to them. \n25) Tailor every presentation to the specific needs of the prospect . \nA sheep-dip approach will never hit the mark for new prospects, so ensure every solution you offer is personalised and adapted to their needs. \n26) Put the emphasis on value rather than price. \nProspects will always concentrate on lowering your price if they haven\u2019t seen specific value in your solution. \nHighlight that value so price is not the biggest issue. \n27) Think of the connection as a relationship-building exercise rather than a sales transaction. \nThat way, every contact will be built upon rather than a cheapest-deal experiment. \n28) Build a sense of urgency into your discussions. \nMany prospects will say they want to think about things and never get back to you. \nIntroducing a sense of urgency into the decision-making process will help you progress the sale now rather than in six months. \n29) Uncover potential objections early on . \nThis means you don\u2019t go through all the hard work of qualifying and presenting, only to find a big objection that stops you in your tracks. \nSee what potential hazards exist before they become issues later. \n30) Practice dealing with sales objections in a safe environment. \nIf you don\u2019t practice, you run the risk of being caught out, so prepare for any price or other objection before it comes up. \n31) Keep your CRM system up-to-date . \nIf you don\u2019t, you will forget things and it won\u2019t give you reasons for follow-up or help you to generate more future business. \n32) Have a robust and strong follow-up system . \nNot following up routinely will mean a hit-or-miss result when you could ensure you are spending your time wisely by following up when there is future potential. \n33) See your current customers as much greater prospects for further business than cold-calling . \nExisting clients know much more about your capabilities than cold prospects, so build your reputation and keep searching for further business opportunities. \nYou\u2019ll see more interest and greater potential by following some or most of these tips. \nLet me know which ones you are following and any others you think would help our readership. \nHappy Selling!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "sales tip & techniques", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:43.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "56ef8cdd55d491469567e2bd309f9e9196067a3e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_io9yKHXGzEriPicH3Y04ifLgJGlKCvpL_PK4JRtkK9lG9NvYURzAu", "site_full": "www.medhelp.org", "site": "medhelp.org", "site_section": "http://www.medhelp.org/forums/show/63", "site_categories": ["mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Back &amp;

These labels are the most economical in price but still allow the business to identify their employees. Have a look at the following article taking us through the subject Reusable blank name tags for identity.\n\nFirst, consider what event you want to document with a calendar. Is it a pregnancy or how you spent a vacation? You can use vacant scrapbooking calendar pages by adding photos of the expectant mother and her growing belly on different weeks or add the sonogram photos as well. For vacations, you can add photos of the different states or cities or other landmarks you were at during different days.\n\nEngraved ID labels are reasonably cheap and can be bought from local stores where it is possible to personalize them. Many stores offer free pet tag engraving when you purchase a particular tag. Laser engraving makes it possible for text to be written on both sides of the pet tag when the tag is of high quality. This makes it possible to fit in more information.\n\nSometimes, however, it is worth considering limiting the information to just one side of the custom pet tag and then leaving the other side blank - ready to attach a reflective sticker. These stickers are available for around 1 dollar and make it much less likely for your dog or cat to be hit by a car when out at night. Reflective stickers have been used for many years now and work even in low light, requiring no batteries or other electrical source to work.\n\nYou don't need to use blank scrapbooking calendar pages just to document an event, however. You can simply add them to your pages as an embellishment. Think of a page of October for your Halloween page, one of December for your Christmas page, and so on. Because blank scrapbooking calendar pages are unique and add visual interest, they can dress up any page.\n\nWhen employees are wearing badge, it not only identifies them to the public and serves as a more personal connection to the consumer, but it's also a constant visual form of advertising that an employee takes with them into the outside public. As a consumer, we all like to feel a connection to anyone we are exchanging money, and our hard-earned time with and by identifying yourself or your business it's confirms and personalizes that connection.\n\nThe individual squares for each day can be designated for photos, embellishments, and journaling. You don't have to limit yourself to a white background either. Attempt replicating the month onto decorated cardstock. Vary your design by tilting the calendar on the page, or placing it off center. You could even extend the month onto a 2-page scrapbooking layout.\n\nThe most important purpose of the label is that of identifying the employees from the customers. Of course, saving you from this embarrassing moment. Another very valuable component of the name tag is breaking down barriers when communicating with customers. Most customers want personalized service, to feel that their business is important to you. A nametag will allow the customer to feel more comfortable in knowing the employee's name and position in the company.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can get great tips for picking a supplier of blank name tags and more information about a reputable supplier at http://www.floridabadges.com/NameTags/BlankNameTags.html right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:44.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "11d11d6059123e9a278d9d9282be4c11c0f8228e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNL4P8RBUk8sW.J3DRzW90AoM7XoVZFkNHjdOT9sDUlrQs4TprDyCF0hcyWNxyzhz3K38UMuvra.qgg5ZhubG3LhHuSObLLU5GP__ArndLLcL8dvelWoVc5Q-", "site_full": "www.technology.org", "site": "technology.org", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechnologyOrg", "site_categories": ["education", "business"], "section_title": "Technology Org", "title": "Once they start composting, people find other ways to be \u201cgreen\u201d", "title_full": "Once they start composting, people find other ways to be \u201cgreen\u201d", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "11d11d6059123e9a278d9d9282be4c11c0f8228e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNL4P8RBUk8sW.J3DRzW90AoM7XoVZFkNHjdOT9sDUlrQs4TprDyCF0hcyWNxyzhz3K38UMuvra.qgg5ZhubG3LhHuSObLLU5GP__ArndLLcL8dvelWoVc5Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jovita", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "Once they start composting, people find other ways to be \u201cgreen\u201d", "text": "Once they start composting, people find other ways to be \u201cgreen\u201d Posted Yesterday \nWhen one California city started a composting program to keep food waste out of its landfill, residents began to pay more attention to other environmentally sound practices, such as taking shorter showers, according to a study led by Nicole Sintov, an assistant professor of behavior, decision making and sustainability at The Ohio State University. \n\u201cIn our study, one pro-environment change appeared to lead to other benefits nd that could be important to know as city leaders and others consider conservation projects,\u201d said Sintov, formerly of the University of Southern California. \nThe study was part of a larger effort to look at the success of the composting program. Sintov\u2019s study included 284 residents of Costa Mesa, a Southern California city that in 2015 began offering curbside recycling and compost pickup for its residents. Prior to the program, no curbside recycling was offered, Sintov said. The research appears in the journal E nvironment and Behavior . \nSintov and her colleagues were interested in a scientific concept called \u201cspillover,\u201d in which one behavior prompts another. This can work in good ways \u2013 such as a person going to bed earlier because she has started an exercise program. But it can also work in bad ways \u2013 say someone thinks it\u2019s now OK to eat more doughnuts because he\u2019s eating salad a few times a week. \n\u201cThe idea is if you\u2019re investing all these resources \u2013 composting bins and trucks and new facilities \u2013 is it possible that this could lead to any other pro-environment behavior, or do people start to slack off in other areas, which we don\u2019t want,\u201d Sintov said. \nShe expected that the program might be a good way to test spillover when it comes to conservation \u2013 largely because composting is such a hands-on and arguably unappealing endeavor. \nThe researchers asked participants about three food-waste prevention behaviors, including planning meals before shopping. And they asked about seven energy and water-waste prevention behaviors, including taking shorter showers and unplugging electronics when they\u2019re not in use. \nWhen they examined survey results and compared them with the onset of composting, they found that those who began composting food waste also engaged in more efforts to conserve water and energy compared to those who did not compost. \nWhat surprised Sintov was that none of the three food-conservation behaviors appeared to differ much between Costa Mesa residents who started composting relative to those who did not. \n\u201cThis may have been because so many people in the community were already doing a good job planning meals and paying attention to how much food they bought and used. There wasn\u2019t a lot of room for improvement to begin with,\u201d Sintov said. \nThe researchers did not see any of the concerning \u201cnegative spillover,\u201d which would have been identified if residents began to be less careful with food and natural resources after the curbside composting program kicked off. \nThe study took place in a relatively affluent, well-educated community and further research will be necessary to determine if its findings extend to other populations, Sintov said. But it begins to bolster the argument that these types of civic conservation projects may have multiple benefits \u2013 including those that might not be as obvious, she said. \nBeyond demonstrating that composting was tied to greater conservation efforts, Sintov and her collaborators also found a possible psychological explanation for why that happens. \n\u201cWe know that humans desire consistency in our thoughts, feelings and actions. That\u2019s well-established, and that\u2019s tied to our self-perception,\u201d Sintov said. \nShe and her colleagues dug a little deeper in this area, looking for possible scientific links \u2013 or \u201cmediators\u201d \u2013 between composting and the spillover behaviors. \n\u201cOur study found that this happened because waste was on their minds, or \u2018cognitively accessible,\u2019 and this thinking about waste seems to lead you to manage waste in other ways.\u201d \nThe study is relevant to policymakers because it highlights the importance of acknowledging the potential that government programs and other changes could trigger unexpected behavior, Sintov said. It\u2019s also one of the first to examine environmental spillover in a community setting outside of a college campus. \n\u201cIf we can figure out how to institute changes that would encourage people along the path of positive spillover, that would be really cool,\u201d Sintov said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sintov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicole sintov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ohio state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of southern california", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "costa mesa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:44.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a83bf4e1590e11c044a7010383a79985d5138d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSNW0WXnB3CGd3og0dwkDL41lpP4_La.ObVGGK6cH6AflY5lV_cn6Y01wy1Pm6nt4-", "site_full": "www.phcorner.net", "site": "phcorner.net", "site_section": "https://www.phcorner.net/forums/globe-tm-questions.250/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Globe &amp; TM Questions \u2022 PHCorner Community", "title": "Help - Gs50 bug", "title_full": "Help - Gs50 bug \u2022 PHCorner Community", "published": "2017-12-07T13:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.phc.onl/styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "20ce99cf5d1862c167ff9e7846309196bb871162", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSNW0WXnB3CGd3og0dwkDL41lpP4_La.ObVGGK6cH6AflY5lV_cn6YEAneATEEj2.rhWl87MD5xQ--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Flosie_69", "published": "2017-12-07T13:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Yung sorry there was an issue processing your order po :) tapos ulit ulitin mo lang sya :D", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:44.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f03454bb859bd43cc08807c646f3e4139fc6911", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrQ3Rqf3Z1qUwXDNiU9H9YBT5mGKEYfZhIyHFJK4cUNEPhwQuyRN0CDzOYYS8TAeoiQeplSUfUMi4nLdAluFtW9bDaAMp5PNdQ-", "site_full": "buinter.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://buinter.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BuinTer", "title": "What You Must Know Before Buying Blank Name Tags", "title_full": "What You Must Know Before Buying Blank Name Tags", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f03454bb859bd43cc08807c646f3e4139fc6911", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrQ3Rqf3Z1qUwXDNiU9H9YBT5mGKEYfZhIyHFJK4cUNEPhwQuyRN0CDzOYYS8TAeoiQeplSUfUMi4nLdAluFtW9bDaAMp5PNdQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kimo Sleven HD (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "What You Must Know Before Buying Blank Name Tags", "text": "By Amanda Cole \n\nEmpty tags offer the ability to interchange any and all text on the badge as well as using a dry erase marker.

Try to break it down to the pet's name, your house address and zip code and any medical/dietary issues which need to be considered when someone else may come to handle your dog. If it is possible, try to add your telephone number too, in the biggest text available. It is worth considering the bigger labels if you need more space to fill in information.\n\nThis can give you a running history to document how your trip progressed. It makes a great way to outline your vacation itinerary on a layout. Empty scrapbooking calendar pages are also fun for longer events, such as a school year. You can add pages for the month the child entered school with a picture of his or her first day, a page for things like the holidays, and so on.\n\nBy adding the calendar pages you get an idea of when things happened, rather than just having a picture of your child in the snow or playing at a park. Filling an entire year of void calendar pages makes an instant year-in-review album. Try finding empty pages that are the size of your album, like 12x12. Then just slip the pages into an album at the end of the year.\n\nThey capture the light from a headlight of a car and then reflect it back, making the tag visible and the animal apparent to drivers. The design of pet tag that you choose does not matter, as long as it is of good quality steel, making it possible to engrave properly and there is plenty of room for what you want to say. Some of the shapes that are available are bones (for dogs) and fish (for cats) there are circular, diamond, triangular, love heart, shaped ones and you can also get them in different colors.\n\nWhen employees are wearing badge, it not only identifies them to the public and serves as a more personal connection to the consumer, but it's also a constant visual form of advertising that an employee takes with them into the outside public.

You head through all the clutter you have no interest in. Walking to what appears to be the TV section you find only CD's. Confused, you stand blank spinning 360, gazing around the store. No TV's, what the heck is going on here? Guess we'll have to ask someone. We've all been through this. It only needs to happen once before you start looking more closely for a label in the future. Labels are a very important part of any customer service based business.\n\nAnd of course, you don't need to purchase blank scrapbooking calendar pages from your office supply or scrapbooking supply store either. Think of how often you just toss out calendars after the month or year is over; keep these for your scrapbooks.

A number of male Senators have joined them in calling for Franken to step aside. \n\nGillibrand said, \"It would be better for our country if he sent a clear message that any kind of mistreatment of women in our society isn't acceptable by stepping aside to let someone else serve.\" \n\nSenator Bob Casey said, \"I agree with my colleagues who have stepped forward today and called on Senator Franken to resign. We can't just believe women when it's convenient.\" \n\nMeanwhile, in Alabama, it is looking as if Roy Moore will be elected and Republicans in the Senate will \"seat\" a likely pedophile in their caucus. \n\nWhile the Republicans are backed into a corner--most would like Moore to up and disappear--for the Democrats there is a political opportunity. \n\nNo matter how good a senator Franken has been (I think his work and influence are overrated), he has become a political liability to Democrats.  \n\nIt will be difficult to point a finger at the GOP, claiming they are the party of sexual predators Donald Trump and Roy Moore (I can already see the 2018 political ads) while going through months of investigations and technical procedures to determine if Franken is fit to be a U.S. senator. \n\nI am not saying that what Franken has admitted to doing is morally or even legally equivalent to Moore's transgressions, but they both should go.  \n\nFrom my partisan liberal perspective, I would be happy to have Moore in the Senate and ranting on CSPAN while Franken moves on.
