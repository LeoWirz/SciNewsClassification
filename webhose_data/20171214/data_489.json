The Waterfront Marketis at the forefront of this trend, rapidly gaining popularity among residents and citizens shopping for fresh food. \n\nThe Waterfront Market, a 120,000 square meter facility, opened its doors to the public in June 2017. This purpose-built facility is designed to ensure quality and freshness, value for money and convenience for retailers and consumers alike. Located at the intersection of Al Khaleej Road and Abu Hail Street on the Deira Corniche overlooking the Deira Islands, the Waterfront Market has dedicated sections including fish and seafood, fruitand vegetables, meat and poultry, and dry goods including spices, nuts, and honeyall under one roof. \n\nThe Waterfront Market brings a new concept in fresh food retailing and innovates onthe traditional concept of a public market. The complex provides the comforts, convenience and cleanliness that customers have come to expect including ample below-ground parking, fully air-conditioned facilities, world-class hygiene standards and maintenance, supplementary retail and service outlets as well as best-in-class supply chain, delivering a variety of products at advantageous consumer prices. \n\nMohamed Khamis Maktoom Al-Shehhi, Mall Director of Waterfront Market said, \u201cWhen we look at fresh food, quality is critical. There is no question as to the importance of freshness. It provides nutrition and goodness to the body \u2013 from taste to health benefits, not to mention the benefit of reducing the carbon footprint associated with packaging and food processing.\u201d \n\nIn addition to the fresh food markets, the Waterfront Market hosts more than 50 retail outlets to cater for shopper\u2019s daily and lifestyle needs. Retailers include a pharmacy, money exchange and transfer, oud shop, flower shop as well as a variety of food and beverage outlets from tea and coffee shops to casual and family dining options located on the promenade facing the sea. \n\n\u201cWe are confident that the Waterfront Market\u2019s unique proposition will continue to attract food explorers and healthy eaters. Shopping here is an experience residents and visitors from all walks of life will find relevant and inspiring,\u201d concluded Mohamed. \n\nWaterfront Market launched a communication campaign in mid-November aiming to createmore awareness aboutthe destination and showcase the vibrancy,freshness and diversity ofits foodand retail products. The integrated marketing campaign uses an optimal blend of media channels including radio, outdoor, digital and direct marketing as well as in-mall activation programs. \n\nThe Waterfront Market is a modern purpose-built facility development led by Ithra Dubai as part of its efforts to preserve Deira\u2019s legacy in fresh food trading and maintain its iconic status as one of Dubai\u2019s communities rich in heritage and tradition.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mohamed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohamed khamis maktoom al-shehhi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "waterfront market", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deira corniche", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al khaleej road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deira islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ithra dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waterfront market", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:59.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d543a1fd195e1ca74a732fed3bcc435252e47284", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg99Jre0rzFBa_wmbgBf.6xiHNT46ZHIyQNF4BSl._9iNhRZaPEGN_ksV0qgOkiAVaj2N_SIFMhXM0VRjEXTbyIm3fztROEzQtZXYY345lR4Cs0gpqCdYjwe", "site_full": "www.newsr.in", "site": "newsr.in", "site_section": "http://www.newsr.in/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News articles, headlines, videos | newsR", "title": "Liverpool team news: Sadio Mane starts with Fab Four facing Spartak Moscow", "title_full": "Liverpool team news: Sadio Mane starts with Fab Four facing Spartak Moscow - newsR", "published": "2017-12-06T15:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "http://cdn.newsserve.net/700/i/20171206/1202-Liverpool-team-news-Sadio-Mane-starts-with-Fab.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d543a1fd195e1ca74a732fed3bcc435252e47284", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg99Jre0rzFBa_wmbgBf.6xiHNT46ZHIyQNF4BSl._9iNhRZaPEGN_ksV0qgOkiAVaj2N_SIFMhXM0VRjEXTbyIm3fztROEzQtZXYY345lR4Cs0gpqCdYjwe", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsr.in", "published": "2017-12-06T15:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Liverpool team news: Sadio Mane starts with Fab Four facing Spartak Moscow", "text": "Wednesday, 6 December 2017 ( 15 hours ago )\nThe Reds boss has made five alterations to his XI for Wednesday night\u2019s crunch clash at Anfield as he continues to balance rhythm and freshness \ud83d\udc53 View on full article", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsserve.net/p/goal.jpg", "http://cdn.newsserve.net/i/20171206/1202-Liverpool-team-news-Sadio-Mane-starts-with-Fab.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sadio mane", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "liverpool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spartak moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anfield", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:59.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce7ab16a4fdd4cd3b7bbe9ef49bcc302278f3048", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye_rf13VoJjgjSl8nb8HcVnv", "site_full": "texasfishingforum.com", "site": "texasfishingforum.com", "site_section": "http://texasfishingforum.com/forums/ubbthreads.php/ubb/postlist/Board/28/page/1", "site_categories": ["saltwater_fishing", "freshwater_fishing", "fly_fishing", "sports"], "section_title": "Off Topic | Texas Fishing Forum", "title": "John Cena vs Ford", "title_full": "John Cena vs Ford | Off Topic | Texas Fishing Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T03:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b9af76aaaaac0539a9e2c4238f8c5b7632857b9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye_rf13VoJjgjd0_Jj6RJ.3tSwxoV4DlF.g-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Fooshman", "published": "2017-12-06T04:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I was checking it (booklet) out at the local Ford shop the other day and was told you had to apply and qualify for one.

I am not sponsored by XPEL nor have I been asked to write this review. I am just another happy customer that has been using their services for the past 8 years and felt it was about time I showed them some love.\nFour years ago I purchased my FRS and the absolute first thing I did after purchasing it was drive it over to XPEL to get my car wrapped and protected from nasty rock chips as well as anything else that could scratch and or damage the new paint on my car. Originally I purchased a half hood, half roof, as well as half fender kit for my car. Four years later and my paint still looks like the way it did the day I got it. I recently visited my local San Antonio XPEL shop to get upgraded to a full hood wrap, something I should have done the first time around.\nI am no expert when it comes to their film and how exactly its manufactured. All that I needed to know before purchasing their film was that it is \"self healing\". This meant that whenever I would get smaller scratches or swirl marks in the film that they would dissipate after letting the car sit out in the sun for a little bit. I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of this but after three years my film had collected less scratches and swirl marks than the areas of my car without film. As you would expect their film is incredibly thin in addition to being durable, to be exact their ultimate film is something like 0.2mm thick(:drool:). So yea, unless you are really looking for it, its pretty much like its not even there.\nLastly theres XPEL's 10 year warranty that protects you and your film against yellowing, discoloration, peeling, cracking and hazing. So essentially if the film isn't performing the way it should they will replace it! This in my opinion is very important in that some of our body panels (front bumper) are very contoured and require a great deal of effort to properly install the film. So if for some reason your film comes loose one day or you happen to notice a air bubble under the film your local XPEL dealer will replace it.\nOverall I would consider XPEL's film one of the most important and valuable mods I have done to my FRS. My only regret was not getting the whole car wrapped.... $$$.... But if you plan on owning your car for the long haul like I do XPEL's clear bra is a must for protecting your cars paint!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:59.043+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce7ab16a4fdd4cd3b7bbe9ef49bcc302278f3048", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye_rf13VoJjgjSl8nb8HcVnv", "site_full": "texasfishingforum.com", "site": "texasfishingforum.com", "site_section": "http://texasfishingforum.com/forums/ubbthreads.php/ubb/postlist/Board/28/page/1", "site_categories": ["saltwater_fishing", "freshwater_fishing", "fly_fishing", "sports"], "section_title": "Off Topic | Texas Fishing Forum", "title": "John Cena vs Ford", "title_full": "John Cena vs Ford | Off Topic | Texas Fishing Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T03:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3bb3d52dba9800c234db635906ca08d009556414", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye_rf13VoJjgjd0_Jj6RJ.3tAkCHbcwC4gc-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "mattm", "published": "2017-12-06T16:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Originally Posted By: Ojai Angler I have a friend that in 1991, laid down a lot of $$$$ to purchase new GMC Cyclone, after being assured it would be produced for that one year only.\nGuess what, they came out in 1992 and the value plummeted, so much for promises,\nAnd if your buddy had that in writing from GMC he would have a reason to complain/sue.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:59.044+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "160f3e758ad86b07055c31c75f0ea7430bb20dd8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSy03S_B2zdIneI.euTs4vqw1ziIpF2I1Uz2ZoznyjVzRg6MXdyEfNEraeCwhIgibbGi9tzZFum6Q--", "site_full": "www.thedibb.co.uk", "site": "thedibb.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.thedibb.co.uk/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=55", "site_categories": ["travel", "theme_parks"], "section_title": "General Chat - theDIBB", "title": "Adam Lambert & Queen", "title_full": "Adam Lambert & Queen - theDIBB", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.thedibb.co.uk/forums/images/avatars/avatar_55.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 80855, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e83d073c0209030c71bce6a4c6bd504e5312eab1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSy03S_B2zdIneI.euTs4vqw1ziIpF2I1Uz2ZoznyjVzRg6MXdyEfNEraeCwhIgibYS8gF08b1Wejq74MWbYfzK", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Pumpkin Pie", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It was probably a couple of years ago we saw them at the Hydro in Glasgow.

In the last month there have been many scenarios that have evoked feelings from my past life. I am certain I share these feelings with many, if not most, Bosnians in our community. Recently, Ratko Mladic, one of the monsters who was responsible for thousands of murders in Bosnia, finally was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity. This day marked a historical event for us Bosnians around the world. As Mladic sits in a prison cell where he is most likely to die, many Bosnian families like mine continue to fight the left-over nightmares and heartaches his decisions left behind. The atrocities that he committed were fueled by hatred and prejudice, which unfortunately continue to persist today. Milorad Dodik, the current president of the Serb region, sends a message to his people that \"regardless of the verdict, Mladic remains a legend of the Serb nation.\" While Bosnia has lived in peace for over 20 years, the events that scattered us Bosnians all over the globe follow and haunt us every day. It is with this that I wish to send a message that while genocide and mass murders have stopped, the pain that was embedded persists and will persist for generations to come; especially when people like Mladic are still seen as legends and not as the monsters for which they are. Dr. Dina Radeljas PhD, came to the United States as a refugee in 1995. Her family fled Bosnia in 1993 and spent over a year and a half in a refugee camp in Pakistan.

It is used to dilute the voting power of the opposing party's supporters, and to extract the opposing party's voting power from one district to consolidate the party in power's voting strength in other districts. \nIt can also be used to protect incumbents. And incumbent politicians look out for their party's interests instead of constituents' interests. The term was created by Massachusetts Jeffersonians when Elbridge Gerry was governor of Massachusetts in 1812. Gerrymandering can have a detrimental and harmful effect on the principle of democratic accountability. To annul gerrymandering is to stop redistricting and use existing political boundaries, using fixed districts, such as state, county or provincial lines. U.S. senators are elected by their entire state. \nGerrymandering is a tool to divide and distort the electorate. Why bother-to vote when the result seems preordained? Partisan gerrymandering is an unethical abuse of power. How can political gerrymandering help our system of government and what value is it to our democracy? It has a corrosive effect on the integrity of democracy. Democracy works when the voters pick their representatives. Our American democracy is broken and drastically needs to be fixed after 205 years of dirty politics. Washington's responsibility is to lead the nation and ideally bring honesty and morality back to politics. Our representatives should be honest, trustworthy and bring transparency to our government and make America the best place on earth. I call on the Congress to legislate and prohibit redistricting for political advantage. \nGerrymandering is the biggest threat and obstruction to true and genuine democracy in our country. Our unpopular Congress can fix our democracy by getting rid of it. By maintaining gerrymandering, we destroy the founding ideals of our republic by allowing our districts to be robbed by partisans which will lead us toward the death of our democracy. \nJoseph Jacob lives in Utica.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph jacob  gerrymandering", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph jacob", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elbridge gerry", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:50:00.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "602d24fdaa4f328607ca5393e198edb92edf7c31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEvNDCtQAc2ELOqqwGUo3CoQtyseDYtPUZzf.LXndR_kjQ7BDBeYAOEMsn5SCAmz63ThbrTWcZW.SINzg1s7.KJmtJaYxosNeEqFm4_pET637e0K7k1n5uRY0vy99ehFsFA-", "site_full": "otorhinolaryngologysfakianakis.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://otorhinolaryngologysfakianakis.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "OtoRhinoLaryngology by Alexandros G.Sfakianakis", "title": "Effect of Body Position on Pharyngeal Swallowing Pressures Using High-Resolution Manometry", "title_full": "Effect of Body Position on Pharyngeal Swallowing Pressures Using High-Resolution Manometry", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "602d24fdaa4f328607ca5393e198edb92edf7c31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEvNDCtQAc2ELOqqwGUo3CoQtyseDYtPUZzf.LXndR_kjQ7BDBeYAOEMsn5SCAmz63ThbrTWcZW.SINzg1s7.KJmtJaYxosNeEqFm4_pET637e0K7k1n5uRY0vy99ehFsFA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anonymous (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "Effect of Body Position on Pharyngeal Swallowing Pressures Using High-Resolution Manometry", "text": "Abstract The effect of body position and gravitational pull on the complex pressure-driven process of pharyngeal swallowing remains unknown. Using high-resolution manometry (HRM), this study aims to identify positional adaptations of pharyngeal physiology by evaluating swallowing pressure patterns in a series of inverted body positions. Ten healthy adults each underwent swallowing tasks with pharyngeal HRM at six body positions using an inversion table (0\u00b0[upright], 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0[supine], 110\u00b0, 135\u00b0, and 180\u00b0[fully inverted]). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess impact of position on pressure parameters, and pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients translate. Velopharyngeal pressures varied by position ( P < 0.001), with significantly higher pressures generated with inversion \u226590\u00b0, compared with upright and 45\u00b0. Change in position did not significantly affect common mesopharyngeal pressures or swallowing pressure durations. UES valving mechanisms were preserved during inversion, with subtle variations observed in integral pressures ( P = 0.011). Pharyngeal-UES pressure gradients changed with position ( P < 0.01), increasing with inversion > 90\u00b0 compared to upright and 45\u00b0. Mechanisms of deglutition may differ with position and relative direction of gravity, particularly when at > 45\u00b0 inclination. Increased palatal pressure is generated in the upside-down position to achieve nasopharyngeal closure and prevent regurgitation. While other classically measured pressures may not consistently differ with positioning, many individuals exhibit adaptations in pressure gradients when inverted, likely due to a combination of changes in pharyngeal driving force and UES opening mechanisms. Identification of these changes, relative to position, further builds on our understanding of the adaptability of the pharyngeal swallowing system.\n\n\nfrom Swallowing and Swallowing Disorders (Dysphagia) via a.lsfakia on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2nzWiCa\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hrm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ues", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anova", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:50:00.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "de5d48614d236a469cc381ee33a8a35b6cbb6cd5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJpIKC16qphebO71efzjghbK4e1YMmydAq0tCNoTLePcxizbD87Jb3nhe01ZFwowNXJtAY5Jeq3cFzuXJCo9qWzfpUWuMzojQjZWzb3Vi9l7EUCWcvMHaR2ZtGXXHqxXpmqRrwMWV_Pz0AOUowgS1il5O5iPewvVipuuWE_RVWiCU-", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Holiday-Decorations-Christmas-Decorations-Christmas-Lights/LED/N-5yc1vZc3tbZ1z11erc/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Home Accents Holiday 100- C6 Faceted Color-Changing Warm White to Multi-Color Lights-TY-100FC6-WWM", "title_full": "Home Accents Holiday 100-Light C6 LED Faceted Color-Changing Warm White to Multi-Color Lights-TY-100FC6-WWM - The Home Depot", "published": "2017-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/ba9efae7-f506-43e9-bc42-836ffe46745f/svn/home-accents-holiday-string-lights-ty-100fc6-wwm-64_300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 249, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "de5d48614d236a469cc381ee33a8a35b6cbb6cd5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJpIKC16qphebO71efzjghbK4e1YMmydAq0tCNoTLePcxizbD87Jb3nhe01ZFwowNXJtAY5Jeq3cFzuXJCo9qWzfpUWuMzojQjZWzb3Vi9l7EUCWcvMHaR2ZtGXXHqxXpmqRrwMWV_Pz0AOUowgS1il5O5iPewvVipuuWE_RVWiCU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "LizB", "published": "2017-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Color setting too dim", "text": "They looked great!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 1.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:50:00.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "de5d48614d236a469cc381ee33a8a35b6cbb6cd5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJpIKC16qphebO71efzjghbK4e1YMmydAq0tCNoTLePcxizbD87Jb3nhe01ZFwowNXJtAY5Jeq3cFzuXJCo9qWzfpUWuMzojQjZWzb3Vi9l7EUCWcvMHaR2ZtGXXHqxXpmqRrwMWV_Pz0AOUowgS1il5O5iPewvVipuuWE_RVWiCU-", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Holiday-Decorations-Christmas-Decorations-Christmas-Lights/LED/N-5yc1vZc3tbZ1z11erc/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "Home Accents Holiday 100- C6 Faceted Color-Changing Warm White to Multi-Color Lights-TY-100FC6-WWM", "title_full": "Home Accents Holiday 100-Light C6 LED Faceted Color-Changing Warm White to Multi-Color Lights-TY-100FC6-WWM - The Home Depot", "published": "2017-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/ba9efae7-f506-43e9-bc42-836ffe46745f/svn/home-accents-holiday-string-lights-ty-100fc6-wwm-64_300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 249, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "da65d287a63c8ce8308e55af558292b2e8f19ede", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJpIKC16qphebO71efzjghbK4e1YMmydAq0tCNoTLePcxizbD87Jb3nhe01ZFwowNXJtAY5Jeq3cFzuXJCo9qWzfpUWuMzojQjZWzb3Vi9l7EUCWcvMHaR2ZtGXXHqxXpmqRrwMWV_Pz0AOUowgS1il5O5iPewvVip6TiB0UFGzLa56GgH34tSag--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "denise", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "It was not what the picture showed in color of the lights.

According to TMZ , the MMG rapper is currently bouncing around between several different jobs at the moment, and he\u2019s only making 19 cents an hour while doing so. Talk about a paycheck difference. Meek used to get booked for $30K a night, now he\u2019s making pennies on the dollar, literally. RELATED : Meek Mill Judge\u2019s Investigation Urged By Two Social Justice Organizations Serving his 2 to 4 years at the Pennsylvania SCI Chester, Meek is reportedly part of the general labor crew, getting his hands dirty in various random projects. A source says Meek does everything from clean cell blocks & tidy up prison grounds to cook food & wash dishes, he does whatever \u201cgeneral labor\u201d is necessary at the time. He also apparently serves food too, which I\u2019m sure fellow inmates appreciate. The source says Meek is doing all this work with a smile on his face too, and is considered a model inmate who\u2019s been getting some nice perks due to good behavior. Meek reportedly gets access to electrical and carpentry shops, and he\u2019s waiting to get into some therapy courses.

The country was still in the throes of the Great Depression. \nAt Pearl Harbor, military leadership knew and was objecting to American diplomacy pressuring Japan toward hostilities. \nThe scape-goated Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short pleaded with the State Department to back off some to buy time. \nWar was inevitable, in any case. Japan was dominant on the Chinese mainland with intent of dominating the entire Pacific. The US and its allies had to win this WWII for the sake of our of civilized life. \nAmerican diplomacy of pressure continued precipatating the Pearl Harbor sneak attack. Admiral Chuichi Nagumo's post Pearl Harbor report to his superior Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto noted that after the first five minutes into the attack, our Navy's anti-aircraft downed nine Zeroes. This intense response negated the element of surprise.Navy response would have been more decisive had it not been for faulty ordinance, including jammed guns. \nNagumo reported further about the speed and accuracy in the second wave where 20 more Zeroes were splashed. Meantime, the carriers Lexington and Enterprise were at sea delivering Marine aircraft, stripped from Pearl to Wake and Midway islands to provide cover for B-17's destined for the Philippines. \nFearing that a third attack would result in many more aircraft losses, Nagumo cancelled the third wave. His primary concern was the Akagai Task Force with a reduced aircraft complement would be vulnerable if it encountered the fully complemented Lexington and Enterprise as he sailed north. The Akagai was a capital asset that Japan could not afford to lose. \nThrough all of this Admiral Kimmel was roundly criticized for the line up of American capital ships in the harbor. Kimmel's decision was based on docking them in shallow water where if sunk, could be quickly floated and repaired and not sunk in deep water. Kimmel anticipated a possible attack. His decision has been validated. \nWhat American leadership did not know was a short time before the attack, Japan developed torpedo fins permitting operation in shallow water. Unfortunately, Navy guns could not be depressed enough to take out the torpedoes. The torpedoes became extraordinarily lethal, sinking the Arizona, Oklahoma and Utah. \nDuring the Pearl Harbor attack, American AAA fired 3,100 rounds which caused the most civilian deaths from falling shells. As important as anything else in the attack scenario were serious Japanese errors in judgment. \nThe worst misjudgement was Airstrike Commander Mitsuo Fuchida not executing Plan B, if the element of surprise was lost. That called for overwhelming the American defenses. Coupled to this was, Japan had no plans to take out repair facilities, the submarine facilities and fuel tanks, which played heavily into Japan's final demise. Their reasoning was close to being cavalier, that the war would be short and Japan the victors. \nThere is no question that Japan grossly underestimated the United States. Admiral Yamamoto's prophetic quote, \"I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.\" I might add that Providence seemed to favor the United States at this critical time. \nBill Chanatry is owner of Chanatry\u2019s Market in Utica and is a Korean War veteran.

Their vision \u2013 VeloCity \u2013 is a strategic approach to growth and placemaking along the Oxford to Cambridge corridor, centred on a re-imagining of the village for the 21st century. The all-women team is a collaboration between Jennifer Ross of Tibbalds Planning and Urban Design, Sarah Featherstone (Featherstone Young), Kay Hughes (Khaa), Petra Marko (Marko and Placemakers), Annalie Riches (Mikhail Riches) and Judith Sykes (Expedition Engineering). VeloCity focuses on six villages situated to the south east of one of the new stations on the Oxford to Cambridge rail link as a test bed. It advances a place-based vision for reimagining how a group of smaller villages might evolve over a 30-year period. Taking the opportunities that will be created through the introduction of a new integrated system of fast rail and road links connecting major towns and cities, the proposals introduce an associated finer grain network of local, medium and longer distance cycle and pedestrian routes and in so doing the strategy seek to explore how we might plan for a future which no longer needs to rely so heavily on movements by car. The vision has been developed to enrich village life and a sense of place, while creating new homes and working environments in healthy and socially cohesive places \u2013 described by the team as a modern picturesque. It proposes a way to install a low-cost high speed data network and introduce technology to foster a more sustainable environment and new employment opportunities with an emphasis on the retention and enhancement of the natural environment. Jennifer Ross, Director of Tibbalds Planning and Urban Design, said: \u201cThe successful implementation of this strategy allows for traditional planning policy to be turned on its head and locations that were previously seen as unsuitable for growth transformed into well-connected and sustainable places.\u201d \u201cIt also considers how the vision might be delivered over time and the key actions and interventions that would need to be taken to make it happen. It is a people-centred vision that shows how communities could get involved and shape the places in which they live.\u201d Sarah Featherstone, Director of Featherstone Young, said: \u201cThis is really exciting to see our place-based vision chosen as the winning scheme. Our re-imagination of the 21st century village will provide new homes and working environments whilst retaining the strong character and identity of existing villages. This is a real opportunity to reinvigorate the social infrastructure creating lifetime villages with mixed tenures and integration of shared spaces where people can live, work and socialise together.\u201d Kay Hughes, Director of Khaa, said: \u201cThe National Infrastructure Commission competition shows the benefit of putting design at the heart of deciding how to shape the places we live and work. The VeloCity proposal reconciles the needs of our environment with a high-technology and low-cost future infrastructure. It supports health and wellbeing while creating places with identity and a sense of belonging, a truly collaborative effort from all the team.\u201d Petra Marko of Marko and Placemakers said: \u201cOur proposal addresses people, place and the process how to effect big change over time. It is important to see the National Infrastructure Commission recognise this placemaking approach as an essential and integral part of large-scale infrastructure planning. It\u2019s been a great collaboration.\u201d Annalie Riches, Founding Director of Mikhail Riches, said: \u201cVeloCity is the result of a planning strategy that seeks to ensure the sustainability of the countryside while unlocking the potential for economic growth. We want development to strengthen the identity of village centres \u2013 adding housing density that will in turn support local village economies, rather than sprawling along roads as a car-dependent endless suburb. We want to grow infrastructure along existing corridors and support population growth with robust public transport links. Underpinning this all is a new cycling infrastructure \u2013 a light-touch network linking towns to each other as well as to transport interchanges.\u201d \u201cThe area of the country between Oxford and Cambridge contains some of the country\u2019s most picturesque scenery, as well as some of the best opportunities to grow the economy \u2013 VeloCity suggests a model that will allow the two to coexist in an achievable, pragmatic and environmentally responsible way.\u201d Judith Sykes, Director of Expedition Engineering, said: \u201cVeloCity demonstrates the role of infrastructure in placemaking. Strategic infrastructure investment combined with local networks and digital platforms unlocks potential to create thriving villages for the 21st century.\u201d Cambridge, Milton Keynes, Northampton and Oxford collectively make up the \u2018Cambridge to Oxford connection\u2019. As one of the most economically successful parts of the country outside London, this corridor has the potential to support a further 700,000 jobs by 2050. The NIC was asked to provide the government with proposals to maximise the corridors potential as a globally competitive knowledge-intensive cluster while protecting the area\u2019s high-quality environment, and providing much-needed homes and jobs.

This is a great time to capture meaningful family moments though this is becoming increasingly harder in this plugged-in world. Consider the following fun ideas.\nNature Hunt  \nOne interesting activity the whole family can enjoy is fruit or vegetable picking. You might think you do not live close to a farm, but the rapid rise of the family farm is making it easier to enjoy this activity. Your family should love the idea of eating fruit or vegetables fresh from the earth. There are many resources online that will help you find a farm near you.\nCeremonious Event  \nSpending time together is part of what makes the holidays important, but participating in events that honor traditions is also important. It is easy to skip events that you have to travel to, but these can be worth it. You can see these trips as mini-adventures, which the kids will love. Perhaps you should see where a Tashlich is taking place, and be sure to go. Those who live near water may see this ceremony take place as it is described in the texts. It is a great opportunity to enjoy something as a family and highlight the power of tradition.\nBe a Tourist  \nYou have seen tourists around your neighborhood and noticed how much fun they have sightseeing. Well, you may want to become a tourist in your own town. You might think you know everything there is to know about the neighborhood, but that may not be true. Book a tour with a professional like Central Park Tours . A professional can offer you the real tourist experience. Take photographs, enjoy the sights, and get lost in the role of your family.\nStorytelling  \nBuild a stage in your backyard for your family. Have each member of your family tell a different story from the Holy Book. Encourage them to get as creative as they want or touch on subjects they might have questions about. Do not be afraid to address these questions because it should help strengthen their faith. You should also take photographs, and record some of these tales so that you can share these moments with other family members. Be sure to focus light towards the center of the stage to make sure your photographs and videos come out as clear as possible.\nVolunteering  \nThere is no better time to teach your family a meaningful lesson than during the holidays. It would be a great idea to set up a trip for a volunteering mission. You do not have to travel to another country to do good in this world. There are a number of community efforts you can volunteer for. This activity should be especially powerful if you have never done this kind of thing with your family.\nThese are just some ideas to make these days more memorable. Consider your family\u2019s suggestions at this time, too. Be sure to talk to elders of the family to get additional ideas that could be useful.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob gorman", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:50:01.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c2d4afd82d5b8a8f9cfdc6731d33f0bbf1b768b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxE0KSOd_YP7jU", "site_full": "www.aldeer.com", "site": "aldeer.com", "site_section": "http://www.aldeer.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&Board=10", "site_categories": ["hunting_shooting", "sports"], "section_title": "Aldeer Classifieds - Aldeer", "title": "I need a car under 2500 bucks for my wife!", "title_full": "I need a car under 2500 bucks for my wife! - Aldeer", "published": "2017-12-06T08:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ec82428a69fff61cf79dff3cdea527d87ecee6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_dlGaiyHn9kDUa_u6LiPoacx9EhguERruduwRn.rLi8pF1JeT3oVkFUTXBkimsy_OGDrDjkfMxE47.qOjt_UJCO8hKJU4SgZuiNaC9599yMg--", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "bowtarist", "published": "2017-12-06T15:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Originally Posted By: goodman_hunter Originally Posted By: bowtarist I've got a 98 altima I'd sell.

Designed by Sheppard Robson and built by Bouygues UK for developer Linkcity, the Ebury Centre combines educational facilities and a 10-storey residential development on a site next to Ebury Bridge, London. REL has completed the installation of electrical services at the new 5,200 sq m University Technical College (UTC). The facility will provide space for 550 pupils and includes workshops for engineering, gym and sports facilities and a large outdoor terrace. Kershaw Mechanical Services awarded REL the contract, which has seen the team install power, lighting, security systems and access control as well as 120 solar panels on the roof. Toby Buckley, managing director of REL said: \u201cThis was a tight programme that had to be completed within 10 months. \u201cWe also had to ensure that the electrical elements met the high environmental targets as the UTC has been designed to meet the BREEAM Excellent standard. This has resulted in a low-energy lighting system and extensive use of photovoltaic panels providing 12 per cent of the energy requirements.\u201d Sunil Rana, project director at Bouygues UK said: \u201cREL\u2019s technical support, teamwork and can-do approach were key factors in the success of this project. The team was very helpful throughout and we look forward to working with them again. \u201c The UTC sits alongside 47 residential units which will be completed in early 2018. REL is also carrying out the electrical works for this part of the scheme.

It permits a perfect seed and grain protection from all sorts of insect pests without using any chemicals, neither liquid nor gas, or even cold chain. This method avoids the issues of pesticide residues and insect mutations. Image credit: nOx Big bag nOx contains an intern gas hermitical liner with a suction valve. When the bag is filled up and sealed, a simple vacuum cleaner permits to create partial vacuum. The extracted air is replaced by an equivalent volume of CO2 (alimentary CO2- inert gas). Anoxia is lethal for free insects. But a three week treatment with CO2 will also permit to eradicate hidden insects (worms and eggs). Another advantage is the seed preservation from humidity and against new pest contamination in the storage place. This technique is perfectly appropriate for organic seeds and legumes, for instance as a satisfactory control of bruchid on lentils. No specific and expensive equipment is required to use the big bag nOx. A classic soldering clip to seal the liner, a domestic vacuum cleaner and a blower. Big bag nOx are also adapted for automatic bagging line with blowing to format the liner before filling. Big bag nOx dimensions are 900x900x1600 mm with a capacity of 1200 kg.

More than a thousand firefighters were struggling to contain a wind-whipped brush fire in southern California on December 5 that has left at least one person dead, sent thousands fleeing, and was choking the area with thick black smoke. / AFP PHOTO / Kyle Grillot \nLocal emergency officials warned of powerful winds on Thursday that will feed wildfires raging in Los Angeles, threatening multi-million dollar mansions with blazes that have already forced more than 200,000 people to flee. \nAuthorities issued a \u201cpurple\u201d alert \u2014 never used before \u2014 because of the extreme danger, warning that winds could reach 80 miles an hour (128 kilometers an hour), severely limiting firefighting efforts. \n\u201cAs expected winds have increased dramatically,\u201d Cal Fire, the agency responsible for fire protection in the state, said on Twitter. \u201cStay alert and prepared in case of evacuations. If you feel unsafe, evacuate.\u201d \nThe flames have swallowed about 80,000 acres (32,000 hectares) in just over a day since the \u201cThomas\u201d fire, currently the state\u2019s largest, broke out, leaving at least one person dead in an area about 45 minutes\u2019 drive from downtown LA. \nHigh winds caused another wave of wildfires to erupt on Tuesday night, including one in Los Angeles\u2019 affluent Bel-Air neighborhood. \nThe area battled gridlocked traffic as residents fled ash and smoke that churned over the smoldering hillside in the second-largest US city. \nFire crews worked to save luxury homes threatened by the flames. \nCelebrities evacuated Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said more than 230,000 people had been forced from their homes in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. \n\u201cVery strong winds\u201d blowing from the northeast to the southwest were causing the fire to balloon, he said, warning Angelenos to be ready to flee at a moment\u2019s notice. \nIn Bel-Air, that\u2019s exactly what they did. \nThe \u201cSkirball\u201d fire ignited Wednesday morning and quickly grew to engulf about 150 acres around the district, home to celebrities and billionaires including SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and pop superstar Beyonce. \nPolice knocked on doors and used loudspeakers to make sure everybody had left their mansions. \n\u201cThey told even us to leave,\u201d one of the officers said. \nAmong the last to go was Evan Kleib, a bearded photographer, locking his door. He put his camera and his dogs in his vintage burgundy car and left the home where he has lived for several years, its fate uncertain. \nUS media reported that the Bel-Air Moraga Estate of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, which contains a vineyard, was threatened by the wildfire. \nThe singer Lionel Richie cancelled a concert to help his ex-wife flee the area, while comedian Chelsea Handler and designer Adrienne Maloof were among celebrities tweeting that they had to evacuate. \nAmong those evacuated was model Chrissy Teigen, wife of singer John Legend. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d get to actually play what I thought was a hypothetical game of what would you grab if there were a fire,\u201d Teigen wrote on Twitter. \n\u201cWe are fine and we will be fine. thinking of everyone else affected and continuing my lifelong intense love of firefighters,\u201d she added. \nForecasters predicted that winds could cause fires to spread further, threatening more upscale homes and the acclaimed Getty Center museum. \nThe \u201cSkirball\u201d fire \u2014 near a cultural center of the same name \u2014 also prompted authorities to close the 405 Freeway, a major commuting corridor. \nResidents of wealthy LA neighborhoods between Mulholland Drive to the north and Sunset Boulevard to the south were part of the evacuation zone. \nFlames menacing art The Getty arts institution \u2014 home to masterpieces including works by Edouard Manet \u2014 was closed until at least Thursday. \nMuseum authorities tweeted that \u201cair filtration systems are protecting the galleries from smoke.\u201d \nThe prestigious University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) is near the same area and also ended up evacuating, after students began the day wearing masks. \nDozens of schools were closed, as was Santa Monica College. \nJust north in Ventura County the \u201cThomas\u201d blaze continued out of control, after erupting in the hills of oak and scrub north of Santa Paula, powered by strong seasonal guests known as Santa Ana winds. \nState of emergency At least 4,000 firefighters were deployed across the entire fire zone, including on the scene of the \u201cRye\u201d blaze \u2014 which had grown to 7,000 acres in the Santa Clarita area \u2014 as well as the \u201cCreek\u201d fire north of downtown Los Angeles that had grown to more than 11,000 acres. \nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency over the area on Tuesday. \nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said it had released funds for relief services. \nUS President Donald Trump tweeted a message of \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to California as it nears the end of its deadliest year ever for wildfires.

That often leads to the understaffing of correctional officers, hiring unqualified workers, offering limited health care, etc.\nHigh recidivism is also clearly profitable for these companies. After all, CoreCivic (then operating as CCA) once wrote letters to 48 state governors offering to buy their prison facilities as long as the states signed 20-year contracts with guarantees of 90% occupancy rates.\nHowever, CoreCivic\u2019s executives now claim that their company is moving in a new direction and that it wants to be \u201cpart of the solution\u201d for our nation\u2019s mass incarceration problem. The recent article by the AP mentioned that CoreCivic is now advocating to \u201cBan the Box,\u201d i.e. pressuring employers to remove questions about criminal history on applications. The company also claims that it will lobby for government initiatives that reduce the prison population, such as re-entry programs. Furthermore, CoreCivic promised to provide political donations to candidates who are focused on criminal justice reform.\nClearly, these are all commendable decisions and this sounds like a positive development. It would be nice to believe that a historically corrupt company has changed its ways, but talk is cheap. Therefore, let\u2019s examine the company\u2019s political contributions and see if there are signs of progressive change.\nLast election cycle, the company donated nine times more funds for Republicans than Democrats. Obviously, not every Republican on Capitol Hill views criminal justice reform as being \u201csoft on crime,\u201d but they are in the minority.\nTake for example, Sen. Rand Paul whom has never received a penny from CoreCivic. He introduced S. 827, the REDEEM Act , which would allow nonviolent offenders to petition to seal their records and the automatic sealing of records for nonviolent juveniles, among other forward-thinking measures.\nWith that said, CoreCivic\u2019s top recipient last election cycle in the Senate was John Portman (R-OH). He\u2019s one of the Senate\u2019s most moderate Republicans. He has sponsored multiple bills intent upon criminal justice and prison reform. That includes the Recidivism Reduction and Public Safety Act, the Second Chance Act, and the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.\nThe problem is that CoreCivic political donations send a mixed message, at best. The top recipient in the House provides a better indicator of the company\u2019s overall donations. Last election cycle, that person was Rep. John Culbertson (R-TX) who has been an adamant opponent to prison reform. Case in point, Culbertson once drafted a bill to eliminate funds from the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, which addresses many of the issues that lead to mass incarceration.\nFurthermore, Culbertson has also drafted multiple bills to give more penalties for illegal immigrants, which has been a pivotal issue for the private prison industry. In fact, he once criticized the director of ICE for not keeping the detention centers perpetually full with prisoners.\nThe GEO Group, the largest private prison corporation in America, also contributes heavily to Culbertson and other like-minded candidates. However, contrary to CoreCivic, their company seems to have abandoned its attempts at building public goodwill. Then again, the GEO Group has been down this road before and attempts to resurrect the company\u2019s image were disastrous.\nIn 2013 the GEO Group entered into a sponsorship deal with Florida Atlantic University to name the school\u2019s football stadium after its company. However, the students and faculty reacted vehemently to this decision with protests and the agreement was quickly nullified. Ever since then, it seems that the GEO Group has decided to no longer waste its time making public overtures.\nIn fact, the GEO Group apparently has doubled down on its unapologetic, good old-fashioned brand of crony capitalism. Both CoreCivic and the Geo Group pay for high-power lobbyists and make significant political donations. However, the GEO Group has gone the extra mile. That includes using its subsidiary to make a $100,000 donation to Trump\u2019s Super PAC (a potential violation of federal law).\nTheir company also hired three politically-connected lobbyists, two former aides of Jeff Sessions and a representative of the Trump Organization. Also, the company even chose to host its annual leadership conference at Trump\u2019s resort in Doral, FL.\nAs mentioned earlier, CoreCivic also throws its money around for political purposes. For instance, both CoreCivic and the GEO Group provided $250,000 for President Trump\u2019s inauguration. In fact, this cronyism has been a cornerstone of the company\u2019s success.\nCorrections Corporation of America (CCA) was founded in Nashville, TN in 1983 with a co-founder, Tom Beasley, who was also the head of the Tennessee Republican Party. Cozy political relationships helped create a mulita-billion company, along with insulating it from accountability.\nThere are many lawsuits and scandals associated with this company, one of the most notable being the \u201cGladiator School.\u201d Idaho\u2019s largest prison, the Idaho State Correctional Center, acquired that nickname while being operated by CCA due to its high violence rate, which was encouraged by the guards.\nIn fairness, there is a violence and corruption problem in both public and private prisons. However, this corporation clearly prioritized profits over rehabilitation because it understaffed that facility by thousands of hours. The employees also falsified documents to make it appear that CCA was upholding proper correctional standards.\nCorrections Corporation of America changed its name to CoreCivic last year in an attempt to reshape the company\u2019s image. That decision was on the heels of a major announcement two months earlier by the Department of Justice, i.e. federal contracts would no longer be issued to private prison companies. The decision was based upon a report by the Inspector General\u2019s Office that found that there was more violence in private prisons than government-run prisons.\nCoreCivic would like you to believe that its scandals are all part of the far-distant past. However, a report from last year by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice showed a disturbing trend of willful negligence.\nThat report detailed CoreCivic\u2019s performance in the Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, MS. There was an inmate riot in 2012 that led to a murder and several injuries while this prison was operated by CCA. Understaffing and a lack of Spanish-speaking staff were noted as the key contributing factors. However, the audit by Inspector General\u2019s Office from last year found that CCA had less staff in 19 of the 38 months following the riot. Also, only 4 out of 367 members of CCA\u2019s staff spoke fluent Spanish in this prison of predominantly Mexican nationals.\nAnother Inspector General\u2019s report from April of this year highlighted CoreCivic\u2019s understaffing issues in Leavenworth, KS. The prison was at times understaffed at levels so low that the company decided to cut various security posts and forced staff members who were not corrections officers to perform security duties. Also, CoreCivic had a policy of triple bunking inmates in cells designed for two people and the company concealed this information from American Correctional Association, which conducts audits of prison facilities.\nCoreCivic was also fined $43,750 two months ago for improperly counting the inmates in its Hartsville, TN facility. An audit later found that the same facility was severely understaffed and didn\u2019t provide adequate healthcare services.\nJim Casey, an award-winning drug and alcohol counselor, ran a rehab program in this same prison. He publicly and privately forewarned of these and other issues. According to Casey, CoreCivic had several inmates who were officially enrolled in his program but weren\u2019t actually participating. That helped to artificially inflate the company\u2019s compliance records. Some of the names on the roll had actually already been released from prison.\nAre you noticing a trend? CoreCivic\u2019s representatives are saying all of the right things in public, but the company\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t suggest that a real cultural change has taken place. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the progressive rhetoric from CoreCivic\u2019s representatives will eventually match the company\u2019s actions.\nBrian Saady is a freelance writer and author of four books.

Phase one of the ICO will involve putting the utility coin on offer, while Phase 2 will kick in when cryptocurrency exchanges are up and running, he said. People are getting tired of ICOs with wasteful dreams and want it (the tokens) to backed by something tangible, says Wealth Migrate founder \nAdded to this, the ICO will also include elements of gamification, he said. For example, investors will be able to earn coins by participating in certain activities, such as training courses, he pointed out. \nIn addition, he said documentary film maker Jeff Hays is working with Wealth Migrate to shoot a documentary on wealth creation. \nWealth Migrate was founded in 2010 and has 60 employees at present. The company has since facilitated 1500 investment transactions totalling $66-million and involving investors from 46 countries, through its blockchain platform. \nPicken said a number of South Africans have also participated in these transactions \u2014 via Wealth Migrate\u2019s partner, business advisory service PKF, which is registered with the FSB. \nWhile he conceded that this isn\u2019t the \u201cideal way\u201d to carry out equity crowdfunding in South African, it is the only way to do so under the current regulations. \nSouth Africa at present has no specific regulations on equity crowdfunding. Picken is one of the founding members of the African Crowdfunding Association, which is seeking to advocate for crowdfunding regulation on the continent. \nRead more: SA equity crowdfunding site Uprise.Africa launches after response from FSB \nIn addition, 120 investors owned a 35% stake in Wealth Migrate, following a crowdfunding raise the company did in 2014. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty much a community-built organisation,\u201d commented Picken. \nHe said Wealth Migrate will run a seminar in Japan next Tuesday (12 December 2017) to inform potential investors about the ICO. In the past two months the company has run seminars across the world, he said \u2014 in cities such as London, Las Vegos, Davos, Dubai, Brisbane and San Francisco, among others. \nThe company plans to launch its marketing campaign for the ICO on 15 December \u2014 the day in 1791 when the US Bill of Rights was signed into law. \nSaid Picken: \u201cWe believe it\u2019s time to democratise wealth\u201d. \nWith the price of Bitcoin having this week breached the $12 000 level, investors and onlookers will be eager to find out more, come next week. \nFeatured image: nattanan23 via Pixabay \nEditor\u2019s note (8 December 2017): Subsequent to the publication of this article Jaco van Niekerk, Wealth Migrate\u2019s head of legal & global compliance, clarified that Wealth Migrate has a business association with PKF Capital Markets (Seychelles) Ltd, which is a Registered Securities Dealer with the Financial Services Authority of the Seychelles. \u201cInvestors that invest in real estate opportunities (do so) via the Wealth Migrate platform and (do) not participate via PKF,\u201d he said. \nIn addition, he said some regulators, like the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US, consider an ICO as a security offering, in which full compliance with the relevant securities laws are necessary. \u201cThe ICO of Wealth Migrate will be a utility token and is not equity crowdfunding,\u201d he added.

None of them happened. Let's review ... OH! First let me explain, I didn't like today's prompt of \"How are you going to achieve your goals\" ... yeah ... :: shakes head :: not even ... I have no way to get more money unless I manage to be the first person in history to plant a Money Tree .. since that's not going to ever happen, we'll just talk about what a failure I am. Sound good? GREAT!!! These are my 2017 GOALS .... Let's go through them one by one. I have a lot of hopes for 2017. #1: Keep the streak going of keeping Nathan non-admitted! DONE!! HOLY SHIT!!! I DID ONE!! Well I didn't... but ... ya know.. Wait, though, the year isn't over - perhaps I should not celebrate this one until the actual new year. #2: I want DB and I to really make more time for him and I. A monthly date. Really need it. Okay - I wouldn't say we DIDN'T do this, but we have some issues that create road blocks for this. For example, MONEY. There is never enough and so many hands out. For another, with him a full time student and four other students in the house... who has time to think? HOWEVER we might not have made a lot of time together, but our marriage isn't horrible. This isn't 2014. Even though we came out of that year stronger in who we are, how well we know each other, and being a solid couple who truly love each other, it is NOT one that I would want to repeat. #3: I want read at least 26 books this year. That's two a month. I don't get a lot of time to read, and I've been making it more of a point to really get back into reading. BWAHAHAHAHHAHAHHA (gasp) BWAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAAHHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ... Okay seriously though, I think I've been reading the same book for the last 9 months. I take it everywhere I got but yet reading doesn't happen. OMG ... nope, I guess that was being generous! I read TWO BOOKS TWO. (hangs head in shame.) ::: sobs :::: TWO!!! I truly suck. I stand corrected, THREE... I read THREE books.... Let's hope I can do better next year.... #4: Polish the book that was finished, and figure out what I want to do with it. Yeah that didn't happen... but I could possibly MAKE this happen before the end of the year. who am I fooling? I don't have the time... #5: Be part of the #365Project of sharing at least one photo a day. I'm doing it on Facebook and Instagram (and Twitter because Instagram posts to my Twitter.) I think I'll add it to my Google+ too. (I'll have to catch up there though) .... FAIL I mean I almost did it - but not a sharing ... but taking pics every day. I know there are some days that I missed but yeah... I mean, it's a fail. But maybe I'll give me a partial fail? H #6: I REALLY want to write at least one blog a day. I know I have said this the past couple of years, and I fully intend to, but then life runs away and ... ugh. I stop. But blogging is literally my main form of therapy. I have to purge my feelings. My blog isn't a \"working\" blog. It's not about making money, it's JUST about sharing my life and being able to look back on my blog for the memories. If you happen to follow along, great! Best laid plans NOT EVEN REMOTELY CLOSE! I should take away the partial fail I gave myself to make up for the complete suck ass I did on this one. #7: I have noticed that I have been losing friends. Which sucks. Do I know why? No. I mean, I thought I would make some friends and then I find out that they have removed me on Facebook and it kinda stinks. I really need more friends. I do have a lot of close friends. But I'm a greedy bitch and I want more. I need more of that \"talk daily: type of friendships. Some of my closest friends, I'm not talking to daily, and I think I'm gonna have to try to change that. So watch out girls! I'm coming for you (if we don't already talk daily). But I really do need some closer friends. I have some intense close friendships. Long term ones. Of course DB is up there at the top. \"C\" I have known since - crap, a long time. JR High? We're super close, both single mother kids (us being raised by single mothers, not us being single mothers, was I drunk when I wrote this?). I've been there since day one of her relationship with her husband. She's got all boys too, all my nephews. <3 them all. \"L\" I have been friends with since... Cal was 3. We were on the committee together for preschool stuff. She needed a ride home that fateful night and I was like get in. We've sometimes had a love/hate relationship, but I love her to death, and I have a nephew and two nieces with her. \"SeattleS\" (there are two with the same name) - our relationship is always amazing. She's super intellectual and I love our conversations sometimes, well I love them all the time, but she's special. I met her in highschool when I shoved a short story at her that I wrote and told her to read it. I just bully myself into peoples lives. \"Mi\" I have been friends with since Cal was 3. Her daughter and Cal were in preschool together (along with \"L\"'s son) and we became fast friends. I remember seeing \"Mi\" at the clinic I went to at the time, she had come in with her newborn baby (her daughter) and I was overly pregnant with Cal, I remember looking at her and thinking, I need to be friends with her. Which is funny because - 3 years later - we were! She has a rough relationship, and I've been with her through a lot. Sometimes I think she's a bit crazy, but I do love her for it. But I do distinctly remember that day at the clinic. Ummm... let's see. \"Di\", \"Me\" & \"J\". Well, \"Me\" is my little Hippie. \"Di\" is my paranormal buddy. and \"J\" is amazing. (they all are.) \"Me\" and I both have all boys. \"Di\" is such a hard worker, she pushes through so much, and carries a lot around on her shoulder. \"J\" and I had an instant bond, she didn't know it at first, but after I kept poking at her, she realized it too. We all were pregnant together in 2001/2002 and the four of us have always just stuck together. \"J \"and I have this crazy amazing bond though. We've been through a lot of stuff, our lives are full of these distinct parallels of going through the same things at the same time. And the other \"S\" and I met in the NICU. She was married to someone I had gone to Jr. High & Highschool with. But we were put right next to each other in the NICU - we both had lifer preemies. Ones who were spending more than a week in the NICU. Both her boy and mine were under 2 lbs when they were born. So yeah. We became crazy fast friends. We would scrapbook and hang out while our babies were in the NICU. We literally pretty much had only each other to lean on because we were two hours from home and our families had to have more of a normal life while we stayed with our babies. We recently reconnected after a whirlwind drama filled time that kinda revolved around my ex husband, a bunch of lies, and a bunch of other things. I am glad we reconnected. So ... new friends? Nope. Wow that was some tangent. Anyway - I need more close friends. There are others I consider close, ones I'd like to be closer with, and there are ones that I have considered best friends with at some point in the past, that I can't say that about anymore. Which sucks. #8: Need to get some of my health issues more under control, maybe if I do that - I'll feel a lot better over all. This one I have actually kind of done. Kind of.. I was pretty much living in bed. I would get up and do stuff as needed but for me to be comfortable and lessen my pain, my legs need to be stretched out in front of me. At my Mom's we were up in our room a lot because my step-dad works late and I was trying to be respectful to him and allowing him to sleep without me or the kids or anyone else keeping him up. Anyway - since we moved - into our own apartment again (I HATE APARTMENT LIVING) ... I have been making it a point to NOT BE IN BED. I still spend a lot of time on my butt but I think I have been pushing myself to be more active and cleaning. I am feeling better. I really am, which is weird, but nice!! #9: Lose weight. I was under 200lbs and now I'm over again, I hate it. Thank you insulin! I want to lose it again. 230 last weigh-in. Sucks. DIdn't lose, gained more. Thank you insulin! But I guess it is what it is. I look at myself and I feel fat (cuz I am) and I don't like it - I would love to get another YMCA membership but we literally can't afford it. We have zero room for anymore bills and I could cry about it, but again - it is what it is. I just gotta focus on each day as it comes and go from there. This will probably still be a goal for every year of my life. #10: We need to do family game night and family movie night more often. We've fallen out of practice. I would like to see us doing both once a week, but I'd settle for one or the other each week. Well we have done some, but not once a month or whatever - but we've been in the apartment for almost 3 months (BTW I should say that I absolutely LOVE this apartment, I am actually really happy here.) ... but this would continue to be a goal. Those are my goals - not resolutions. It feels like resolutions don't work. So they are my goals. That was fun. I am a mom. I am a MOM with kids who have medical issues. I am a MOM and a GRANDMA (Nonna) who has FIBRO and a lot of other health issues myself. I am a MOM who could cry over the fact that the simple act of taking a shower wears me out so much that I could nap for a year after. Not even a joke OF COURSE I AM A FAILURE!!! I am ... not a failure. I am a human, a wife, a daughter, a best friend and friend, a soul sister ... I am a strong woman who believes that her kids won't blame everything that went wrong in their lives on their parents, but appreciate all the things we managed to make happen. Failure or not, I love my family. I love my whole family.

Keep reading\u2026 Melanie Martinez, a musician and former contestant on the talent competition show \u201cThe Voice,\u201d has been accused of rape by her former best friend. On Monday night, musician Timothy Heller released a statement on Twitter claiming the singer touched her without permission, performed nonconsensual oral sex on her, and penetrated her with a sex toy. Heller says they were having a sleepover one night when Martinez began asking her about her sexual preferences and asking her for \u201chours\u201d if they could have sex, insisting they could keep it a secret and it would be fun. Heller says she declined Martinez\u2019s offer but was forced to endure the same thing the next night. After the two smoked marijuana at Martinez\u2019s insistence, Heller says she again asked if they could have sex. \u201cI said every form of no I could think of. As I lay praying to fall asleep, she began touching my arm. I allowed this to happen. Maybe she\u2019d give up. This went on for maybe an hour. I got increasingly uncomfortable,\u201d she wrote. Heller says Martinez then began pleading with her to touch other body parts, including her breasts, which Heller allowed, hoping it would make her stop. That was when, according to Heller, Martinez raped her: \u201cJust so there is no confusion, I was molested by my best friend. I lay still, in shock, completely not reciprocating\u2026 She performed oral sex on me and then I was penetrated with a sex toy without being asked. That\u2019s what happened. The bottom line that I need to always remind myself is that: I said no,\u201d Heller wrote. She added her decision to reveal this secret was inspired by the recent #MeToo movement and the flood of women revealing decades of sexual abuse. At the end of the day, you own your body so don\u2019t allow anyone, even a best friend to molest you. Do not allow it either out of pity or fear.

It'll work out. Even if I have to give the kids IOUs... But seriously ... I love Christmas, absolutely love Christmas and the spirit of Christmas. I'm not talking the selfish materialistic asshats of Christmas,... not talking about the Scrooges of Christmas who buy up ALL of the must have gifts of the year and charge a million dollars for it, not talking about the doorstop box stealing crews... I am talking the joy, the utter happiness and excitement it brings... bring family together and loving every minute of it. Laughter... lights and sparkles and putting other people's happiness before your own. THAT is what Christmas is for me... I just wish it weren't so stressful too. And SNOW... I don't miss winter in Wisconsin. I don't miss the cleaning of the snow, the shoveling and hassle it creates. I CERTAINLY do not miss the bitter cold.
