Defying dire, worldwide warnings, Trump insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, starting with what he said was his decision merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel\u2019s government. He also said the United States would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable. \u201cWe cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past,\u201d Trump said, brushing aside the appeals for caution from around the world. Harsh objections came from a wide array of presidents and prime ministers. From the Middle East to Europe and beyond, leaders cautioned Trump that any sudden change on an issue as sensitive as Jerusalem not only risks blowing up the new Arab-Israeli peace initiative led by Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, but could lead to new violence in the region. No government beyond Israel spoke up in praise of Trump or suggested it would follow his lead. Israelis and Palestinians reacted in starkly different terms. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed Trump\u2019s announcement as an \u201cimportant step toward peace,\u201d and Israeli opposition leaders echoed his praise. But Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Trump\u2019s shift serves extremist groups that want religious war and signals U.S. withdrawal from being a peace mediator. Protesters in Gaza burned American and Israeli flags. Trump\u2019s declaration of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital is a powerfully symbolic statement about a city that houses many of the world\u2019s holiest sites. Trump cited several: the Western Wall that surrounded the Jews\u2019 ancient Temple, the Stations of the Cross that depict Jesus along his crucifixion path, the al-Asqa Mosque where Muslims say their Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. And there are major ramifications over who should control the territory. The United States has never endorsed the Jewish state\u2019s claim of sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem and has seen the city\u2019s future as indelibly linked to the \u201cdeal of the century\u201d between Israel and the Palestinians that Trump believes he can reach. Beyond Kushner, Trump has dispatched other top emissaries to the region in recent months in hopes of advancing new negotiations. Trump said he wasn\u2019t delivering any verdict about where an Israeli-Palestinian border should lie. Instead, he described his Jerusalem declaration as recognizing the reality that most of Israel\u2019s government already operates from the city, and he suggested the U.S. ally should be rewarded for creating a successful democracy where \u201cpeople of all faiths are free to live and worship.\u201d \u201cToday we finally acknowledge the obvious,\u201d he said, emphasizing that he wouldn\u2019t follow past presidents who tiptoed around Jerusalem out of diplomatic caution. U.S. embassies and consulates around the world were put on high alert. Across the Middle East and Europe, they issued warnings to Americans to watch out for violent protests. In Jordan, home to a large Palestinian population, the U.S. said it would close its embassy to the public today and urged children of diplomats there to stay home from school. Later Wednesday, the State Department issued an updated \u201cWorldwide Caution\u201d to U.S. citizens abroad, advising travelers to \u201cbe alert to the possibility of political unrest, violence, demonstrations, and criminal activities.\u201d There was little in Trump\u2019s statement to encourage the Palestinians. Although he recited the longstanding U.S. position that Jerusalem\u2019s borders must still be worked out through negotiation, he made no recognition of the Palestinian claims to east Jerusalem. For the first time, Trump did appear to endorse the concept of an independent Palestine existing alongside Israel. Yet even that idea appeared conditional, as he said he\u2019d promote the \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d if both sides agreed. Netanyahu\u2019s government is dominated by hardliners who oppose Palestinian independence. Trump made no reference to signing a waiver that officially delays any move of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but the White House confirmed he signed the waiver Wednesday. It means there will be no embassy move for at least another six months. Establishing a Jerusalem embassy was a major campaign promise of Trump\u2019s and one that officials said he focused on in discussions with top advisers in recent weeks. On Wednesday he focused on his directive to the State Department to begin a process of moving the embassy as required by U.S. law, however many years that might take. After his speech, he signed a proclamation to that effect. In Germany, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said work will begin immediately to identify a site. A non-governmental expert on the Middle East who consults regularly with the White House said the Trump administration had opted against an earlier plan of converting the existing U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem to an embassy. Instead, it\u2019s looking to construct an entirely new facility, said the individual, who wasn\u2019t authorized to disclose private conversations with U.S. officials and requested anonymity. In making his decision, Trump overruled more cautious counsel from Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, who voiced concern about endangering U.S. diplomats and troops in Muslim countries, according to officials briefed on internal administration deliberations. Those officials were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cThere will of course be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement \u2014 but we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a place of greater understanding and cooperation,\u201d Trump said. He said he intends \u201cto do everything in my power to help forge\u201d a peace agreement.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prophet muhammad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james mattis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netanyahu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bradley klapper associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. embassy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arab-israeli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al-asqa mosque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. consulate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:24.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6779162b0bbced47b3b02a8be7f455994a673bad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_xDh2ORdMtmUlQkxNdnanot", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Why are there no threads about this thing?", "title_full": "/x/ - Why are there no threads about this thing? - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T22:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 27, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "02643de93d1379644972365b45c8a77fc2df7087", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_xDh2ORdMtmUl1XLvqTzPP0MDjYEpSryC4-", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T08:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>19996747", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:24.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6779162b0bbced47b3b02a8be7f455994a673bad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_xDh2ORdMtmUlQkxNdnanot", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/x/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/x/ - Paranormal - 4chan", "title": "Why are there no threads about this thing?", "title_full": "/x/ - Why are there no threads about this thing? - Paranormal - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T22:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 27, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8f72bc2846811e59e24b65782b1c8514834269ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pFMDNLzmgi_xDh2ORdMtmUl1XLvqTzPP0vZNG6CeZVVE-", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>20000806\nReality is absurd.

Pages Thursday, 7 December 2017 India Newborn 'Mistakenly' Declared Dead Passes Away A premature baby who was \"mistakenly\" declared dead by doctors in India's capital Delhi has died in another hospital where he was being treated.... The doctors at the privately run Max Hospital had pronounced the baby dead hours after his twin, who was stillborn on 30 November, at 22 weeks.The parents said the baby was alive while on their way to his funeral.Their father told reporters that he would not take the child's body home unless the two doctors were arrested.The incident sparked outrage and a debate over the quality of private healthcare which is often costly.The two doctors were fired by the hospital on Sunday after an inquiry. The hospital also sent its condolences to the parents after hearing that the baby had died. \"Our deepest condolences are with the parents and other family members. While we understand that survival in extreme preterm births is rare, it is always painful for the parents and family. We wish them the strength to cope with their loss,\" it said.The state health minister, Satyender Jain, has said the hospital's licence could be cancelled if a probe found it guilty of medical negligence.The Delhi police said on Wednesday that it had transferred the case to its crime unit.The incident came to light when the parents noticed one of the babies squirming inside the plastic bag that doctors had placed the infants in.According to the twins' grandfather, the stunned family rushed the newborn to a nearby hospital where they were told that their baby was still alive, local media reported.This was the second instance in recent months where a private hospital in India has been called out for negligent care. Last month, a girl died of dengue fever in another hospital and the parents allege they were overcharged for her treatment. at ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satyender jain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "max hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:26.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb3394412b315e20c51ce9754fa105be66e4e41f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog669nc0y8UFH_Jf1oX8QNCaYzYY7xsapGd16coXeGNSUYQ77SpXncohU2s0zMpmU0bf4EerFvXKoT5UjnlD..fuIyMYSb9Xw9fRpQvdO2Oy.pAJZUQwH_4pU-", "site_full": "community.myfitnesspal.com", "site": "myfitnesspal.com", "site_section": "http://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/categories/fun-games", "site_categories": ["health", "exercise"], "section_title": "Fun &amp; Games \u2014 MyFitnessPal.com", "title": "Would you want to meet the person above? - Page 180", "title_full": "Would you want to meet the person above? - Page 180 \u2014 MyFitnessPal.com", "published": "2017-12-07T12:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//community.myfitnesspal.com/en/resources/emoji/wink.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 638, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e2a007c33eed912fee996880409e6da657f5d3a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog669nc0y8UFH_Jf1oX8QNCaYzYY7xsapGd16coXeGNSUYQ77SpXncohU2s0zMpmU0bf4EerFvXKoT5UjnlD..fuIyMYSb9Xw9fRpQvdO2Oy.pxBRQqnZ_C8fy5kR9X4kjWg--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Tigg_er", "published": "2017-12-07T15:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "You would fit right in December 7, 2017 7:10AM", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:26.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "871757b0a2375fa9df8a6820a26b1e79942151c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gT.AZYqr_Njc6e2l6MAkO2CFxtmiZhkvnA--", "site_full": "us.battle.net", "site": "battle.net", "site_section": "https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/1011638/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Story Forum - World of Warcraft Forums", "title": "The Real Reason Nightborne Went Horde", "title_full": "The Real Reason Nightborne Went Horde - World of Warcraft Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T10:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/forums/static/images/social-thumbs/wow.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 462, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "91f58c3a95f23c46bcd03cab472a2960bad2d8d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiprHZPl1SRpHHlsc49r_9YtS3xClAZLsnHLfLdMR3gT.AZYqr_Njc6e2l6MAkO2ADhkOKXXUfYrRrMc__4ZLn", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Sarm", "published": "2017-12-07T11:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "That first post isn't saying they want to play as a horde night elf, though.

Putin\u2019s approval ratings regularly top 80 percent, making him all but certain to win the March election by a broad margin. While few doubted the 65-year-old leader would run, the delay in his declaring so fueled some conspiracy theories and was seen as the Kremlin\u2019s political maneuvering. The 65-year-old Russian leader\u2019s potential rivals include several luckless candidates from past contests and a notable newcomer \u2014 TV host Ksenia Sobchak, 36, the daughter of Putin\u2019s one-time boss. The president chose to make his re-election announcement at the GAZ automobile factory in the city of Nizhny Novgorod. The factory is a symbol of Russian\u2019s industrial might, and Putin found an enthusiastic audience in the blue-collar workers who make up the core of his base. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a better place and moment,\u201d he said to massive applause at the plant. \u201cThank you for your support. I will run for president.\u201d For months, Putin fended off questions about his plans for 2018, fueling speculation about why he would not say if he would seek re-election. Some theorized he might step down and name a preferred successor. The Kremlin has been worried about growing voter apathy, and the uncertainty over Putin\u2019s plans seemed intended to encourage public interest in the race. \u201cIt was necessary to ensure electoral mobilization,\u201d Dmitry Orlov, a political consultant close to the Kremlin, said in televised remarks. Putin has been in power in Russia since 2000. He served two presidential terms during 2000-2008, then shifted into the prime minister\u2019s seat because of term limits. As prime minister, he still called the shots while his ally, Dmitry Medvedev, served as the placeholder president. Medvedev had the president\u2019s term extended to six years and then stepped down to let Putin reclaim the office in 2012. If Putin serves another six-year term, which would run through 2024, he would reach the milestone of having the longest tenure since Stalin, who ruled for nearly 30 years. Earlier Wednesday, Putin was asked about his intentions at a meeting with young volunteers in Moscow. He said he would decide shortly, then showed up at the GAZ factory making his announcement. The plant is one of the country\u2019s most emblematic industrial giants. It was built during the Soviet industrialization drive in 1932 and has churned out millions of vehicles, from vans and military trucks to Volga sedans and luxury cars for the Soviet elite. \u201cThank you for your work, for your attitude to your jobs, your factory, your city and your country!\u201d Putin told factory workers. \u201cI\u2019m sure that together we will succeed.\u201d A stream of fawning comments from officials and lawmakers followed his declaration. Chechnya\u2019s regional leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, hailed the president\u2019s announcement, saying on Instagram that only Putin can \u201cresist a massive shameless and unprecedented\u201d pressure by the West. Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of the upper house of the Russian parliament, said Putin\u2019s decision helped end \u201canxiety and tensions in the society.\u201d The upper house is expected to authorize the start of formal election campaigning later this month. Veterans of past campaigns \u2014 Communist chief Gennady Zyuganov, ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and liberal leader Grigory Yavlinsky \u2014 all have declared their intention to run. They will likely be joined by Sobchak, a well-known television host who is the daughter of the late St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, who was Putin\u2019s boss in the 1990s. \u201cI don\u2019t trust a system where Putin makes all decisions,\u201d said Sobchak, who also met with voters in Nizhny Novgorod Wednesday. \u201cLet\u2019s believe in our ability to change the situation.\u201d The most visible Putin foe, Alexei Navalny, also wants to join the race, even though a conviction he calls politically motivated bars him from running. He has organized a grassroots campaign and staged rallies across Russia to raise pressure on the government to allow him to run. In a signal that the Kremlin isn\u2019t going to budge, Navalny\u2019s campaign chief, Leonid Volkov, last week was sentenced to a month in jail for staging an unauthorized rally in Nizhny Novgorod. Navalny himself spent 20 days in jail in October for organizing another rally. \u201cThe best illustration of how elections work in Russia is my campaign chief Leonid Volkov sitting in jail just one kilometer from the venue where Putin declared his bid,\u201d Navalny tweeted.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir isachenkov associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navalny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stalin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gennady zyuganov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grigory yavlinsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmitry medvedev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josef stalin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexei navalny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramzan kadyrov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valentina matviyenko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nizhny novgorod", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir zhirinovsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sobchak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ksenia sobchak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmitry orlov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medvedev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anatoly sobchak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leonid volkov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gaz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "volga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chechnya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. petersburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:26.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e2feb5688db9693c3fe642a2949c5ead7f5a8883", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21SS6F2mIcftAWAw0QAUZUh5MffpZ9NFv1W06TDk0UM0EvYJc_4wADuv8obuj1QQk7Mq5bQL5RvPkC.G1lxUTDQF", "site_full": "answers.wikia.com", "site": "wikia.com", "site_section": "http://answers.wikia.com/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?feed=atom", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Wikianswers  -

Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital despite intense Arab, Muslim and European opposition to a move that would upend decades of U.S. policy and risk potentially violent protests. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) By: Catherine Lucey The Associated Press Published on WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's move to recognize the divided city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital may have triggered a worldwide chorus of critics but the president had his ears closely tuned to his supporters at home. For Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move. \"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\" the president declared Wednesday in announcing his decision. \"Today, I am delivering.\" Those were words to savour for a president who's been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed \u2014 sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns. Repealing the Obama era health care law is a promise unfulfilled, much to Trump's frustration. Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. The president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. On Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box \u2014 although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. Steve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counselled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. Observers were divided on how to score the president's action. \"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" But Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" A host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. But after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. An email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" Critics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. Aaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" Trump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" The president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. During a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" Trump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on.

I wouldn't normally consider tights except that I was asked to review these. I was happily surprised. I didn't feel too ridiculous in them like I'd expected, though I wouldn't go grocery shopping in them. Wearing them on anything from a windy 50deg F day to a snowy 20deg F day and several other trail runs in between, I always felt comfortable. These seemed to be equivalent better than almost any combination of clothing I could be wearing on my torso on a given day. Something about the material is a little bit magic, both a windbreak and breathable. I appreciated the pockets and could fit a phone, keys, etc. easily. Two caveats: I was in between the S and M sizes, and I was glad that I took some others' advice and sized up. I drew in the waist band a little, but overall this was a comfortable skintight fit. Second, the only real complaint is that they seemed to bunch and crease a little above the calf, behind the knee. It could be that this was because of the slightly larger size, or the material, or it's just the way these fit on me -- though I definitely don't have impressively sized calf muscles.

A $25,000 ransom in bit coin was being sought for the files being held. County officials said late this afternoon they are not paying the ransom. (Diedra Laird/The Charlotte Observer via AP) By: Jonathan Drew The Associated Press Published on A North Carolina county is working on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. Mecklenburg County officials say it will take days to restore the computer system. For that time period, residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area will face delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after the cyberattack. County manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker, who is believed to be foreign. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe.

Giancalo Stanton\u2019s trade situation is preventing the Giants from making any moves as such a deal will impact how much money they can spend other places. About half of the remaining teams on the list are linked to Shohei Ohtani. Since both of these situations appear to be heading towards a conclusion within the next week perhaps free agency will finally start. \nFrom what had been spread around about the Padres interest in Hosmer has been largely \u201cdue diligence,\u201d in fact there is about 50 other guys the Padres have reached out in some form or another to say we\u2019d take you on our team if the price is right and you want to come here. The Padres have indeed checked in with Eric Hosmer's camp, but it's mostly due diligence at this point. Per a source, they've checked in with \"around 50\" free agents, majority of them pitchers. \n\u2014 AJ Cassavell (@AJCassavell) November 15, 2017 \nHosmer is a Gold Glove talent defensively but his offensive numbers have been typically bouncing between average to very good. He did win the Silver Slugger this year after compiling a career best .318/.385/.498 line matching his high of 25 home runs while adding 94 RBI. Those numbers would almost certainly drop in Petco Park considering the Padres had an even tougher time than the Royals at scoring last year. \nSo while Myers moving to the outfield allows the Padres to target Hosmer, it\u2019s safe to say he would be willing to make the same move if the team was to sign lesser prized free agents such as a Matt Adams.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eric hosmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wil myers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hosmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon heyman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giancalo stanton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt adams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shohei ohtani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aj cassavell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "myers", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "padres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phillies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardinals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red sox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mariners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rangers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royals", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "petco park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:28.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "96f717f0243b58c6a2b5f6eed558281b24deaf9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTdVHGHrFkH0EUj.5xpFH0rkyaEWzEjglVde1RxRnYpyqq4Z5Gh3SVsX4S.MSyTZfw-", "site_full": "dasauge.de", "site": "dasauge.de", "site_section": "https://dasauge.de/jobs/?rss", "site_categories": ["job_search", "jobs"], "section_title": "dasauge\u00ae Stellenmarkt", "title": "Product Manager 3DDB (f/m)", "title_full": "Product Manager 3DDB (f/m)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "96f717f0243b58c6a2b5f6eed558281b24deaf9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTdVHGHrFkH0EUj.5xpFH0rkyaEWzEjglVde1RxRnYpyqq4Z5Gh3SVsX4S.MSyTZfw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Staramba SE", "published": "2017-12-07T10:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "Product Manager 3DDB (f/m)", "text": "Beschreibung der T\u00e4tigkeit \n  \nStaramba SE is going beyond borders in the world of Virtual Reality.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP/Andrew Medichini By: Joanna Smith The Canadian Press Published on OTTAWA \u2014 The Liberal government wants to lift the mystery surrounding the G7 summit as it prepares to host the gathering next year, in hopes that Canadians will feel more included and, perhaps, less inclined to protest on the periphery. \"The idea is to get input from Canadians,\" Peter Boehm, the Canadian G7 summit sherpa, said in an interview with The Canadian Press. \"What are they thinking about some of the big themes in the world, whether it's economic inclusion, what the jobs of the future might look like, climate change, energy and, indeed, some of the big foreign policy and security questions that might be out there?\" said Boehm. The efforts to open the process up to Canadians includes Boehm speaking at a public event Thursday night, organized by the Toronto branch of the Canadian International Council and the G7 Research Group at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto. \"A lot of this is listening and then feeding it through, but also a chance for us to demystify what the G7 is,\" said Boehm, who is preparing for Canada to assume the G7 presidency in January, six months before it hosts the summit at a resort in La Malbaie, Que. \"It's not just a big gathering where you see a lot of people and even more security.\" Heavy \u2014 and armed \u2014 security presence is a common sight on the edges of G7 summits, where the need to protect the leaders of powerful countries takes on added urgency due to crowds gathered for demonstrations, which have sometimes turned into violent clashes with police. The turbulent Toronto G20 summit in 2010, which included mass arrests and cases of police misconduct, reverberated for years. Boehm suggested involving Canadians along the road to the G7 summit is one way to get ahead of the issue. \"We all have the right to express our views and we fully expect that there will be people who will be expressing their views,\" said Boehm. \"My own view is that it is best to do that from an informed perspective, so that's part of the reason for the outreach.\" Still, Boehm said the summit organizers will nonetheless be prepared for protests. \"In the past at large gatherings there has also been infiltration by less desirable elements who do not want to express views nor hear views, but they want to create mayhem,\" he said. \"So, on the security side, we will certainly be ready for that.\" \u2014 Follow @smithjoanna on Twitter ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trudeau", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "angela merkel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald tusk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean-claude juncker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald j. trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter boehm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boehm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shinzo abe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joanna smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paolo gentiloni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taormina", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook share", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "canadian international council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the canadian press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "g7 research group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "munk school of global affairs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ottawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la malbaie", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:28.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c85684b018c469b0dcbf9ad945e06feb8dd3e772", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iukx.1bvM7k3sm_pKFn98mmcMTan4K3SloMcs67gjYGWApqHfkTiJO_vyaHPO4Zpzt0icQbBQohrXLFjjUkDw70SENk1nb7Y_BBr5rmYiseJk9rd157Rx9tX7.zPBAnlXtxGy_1NzRFBxsessu1vUj1TDJzfmRV88cPOZxOQ55Q--", "site_full": "www.metronews.ca", "site": "metronews.ca", "site_section": "http://www.metronews.ca/feeds.articles.news.rss", "site_categories": ["canada", "travel"], "section_title": "METRO NEWS | NEWS", "title": "As pot becomes legal, parallels drawn to the waning days of alcohol prohibition", "title_full": "As pot becomes legal, parallels drawn to the waning days of alcohol prohibition", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.metronews.ca/content/dam/thestar/2017/12/07/as-pot-becomes-legal-parallels-drawn-to-the-waning-days-of-alcohol-prohibition/TAK104442383.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 37932, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c85684b018c469b0dcbf9ad945e06feb8dd3e772", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iukx.1bvM7k3sm_pKFn98mmcMTan4K3SloMcs67gjYGWApqHfkTiJO_vyaHPO4Zpzt0icQbBQohrXLFjjUkDw70SENk1nb7Y_BBr5rmYiseJk9rd157Rx9tX7.zPBAnlXtxGy_1NzRFBxsessu1vUj1TDJzfmRV88cPOZxOQ55Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lauren Krugel - The Canadian Press", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "As pot becomes legal, parallels drawn to the waning days of alcohol prohibition", "text": "As pot becomes legal, parallels drawn to the waning days of alcohol prohibition Share on Facebook Share via Email Print Local historian and heritage advocate Fred Bradley at the Alberta Provincial Police Barracks historical site in Coleman, Alberta, November 24, 2017. A notorious 1922 police shooting in southwestern Alberta and the sensational trial that followed caused many to wonder whether enforcing alcohol prohibition was worth the trouble.THE CANADIAN PRESS/Todd Korol By: Lauren Krugel The Canadian Press Published on COLEMAN, Alta. \u2014 A notorious 1922 police shooting in southwestern Alberta and the sensational trial that followed caused many to wonder whether enforcing alcohol prohibition was worth the trouble. Alberta's move to outlaw drinking in 1916 was wildly unpopular in the Crowsnest Pass, a cluster of coal mining towns nestled in the Rocky Mountains not far from the B.C. boundary. The area became a hotbed of bootlegging and rum running, with prominent businessman Emilio Picariello \u2014 known also as \"Emperor Pic\" or the \"Bottle King\" \u2014dominating the trade. But on Sept. 21, 1922, Picariello got word that his son was wounded in a police stop. That led to a deadly confrontation outside the Alberta Provincial Police barracks in downtown Coleman hours later. No one knows for sure whether Picariello or family friend Florence Lassandro fired the shot that killed Const. Stephen Lawson. Both were hanged the following spring \u2014 Lassandro the only woman in Alberta to meet that fate. \"It gripped the nation,\" said Fred Bradley, a Crowsnest Pass heritage advocate. \"It would have been the 1920s version of the O.J. Simpson trial.\" With provinces plotting out how they will manage the regulation and distribution of recreational marijuana once it becomes legal this summer, history buffs see some parallels to the waning days of alcohol prohibition in Canada. Every province had its own approach to battling booze in the early 20th century. And, like the way the federal government has approached the legalization of cannabis, the rules for ending prohibition of alcohol were up to each province. Booze flowed freely in British Columbia three years before Alberta, so rum running between the two provinces was rampant. For many in Alberta, the Lawson shooting underscored how difficult and dangerous it was to police prohibition, Bradley said. The province voted to repeal the policy six months after Picariello and Lassandro were executed. Booze sales were legal again in 1924. Other provinces, too, grew weary of the corruption and violence that came with prohibition. Nearly a century later, the Liberal government has said one of the main goals of legalizing marijuana has been to take organized crime out of the picture. \"The end of prohibition was brought about because people began to recognize that the cure, as it were, was worse than the disease,\" said Vancouver historian Daniel Francis. Prohibition had mostly ended in Canada by the end of the 1920s, but it lasted until 1933 in the United States. That presented a lucrative window of opportunity to supply the U.S. market. The distilling business founded by the now-prominent Bronfman family made a fortune. Fishermen in B.C. made good money transporting booze down the coast as a side business. \"They saw an opportunity to make a few bucks,\" said Francis. \"Most of them were small-time businessmen. They weren't big crooks.\" When prohibition ended in the Unites States, the low-level rum runners mostly got out of the illicit trade and went back to their law-abiding lives, said Francis. \"They had no regrets over what they'd done and no guilt that they had been engaging in criminal activity,\" he said. \"They saw themselves as a public service satisfying a quite understandable public need.\" Some of the kingpins, meanwhile, went on to deal in harder drugs like heroin or cocaine. And some people who served booze on the sly during prohibition became legit vendors at hotels and restaurants. But Just because booze was legal didn't mean it was a free-for all, said Dan Malleck, an associate professor of health sciences at Ontario's Brock University who specializes in the history of drug and alcohol prohibition. At Ontario outlets, there were no displays of products on offer. A customer had to fill out a form, line up at a counter and hand a passport-like booklet to a clerk, who would note each purchase. Bottles were handed over concealed in brown paper bags. It was no fun, but people put up with it. \"Most people were decent citizens who wanted to follow the rules,\" Malleck said. There was a bit of a clean-up period while governments tried to nail down the right number of stores, product prices and authorized drinking locations. Provinces will have to find a similar balance once pot is legal, Malleck said, and its effectiveness will depend on how easily consumers can get what they want the legal way. \"The black market always will exist,\" said Malleck. \"But after prohibition that black market in booze was a fraction of what it was.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "o.j. simpson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan malleck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen lawson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emilio picariello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bradley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lassandro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "picariello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lawson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florence lassandro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malleck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lauren krugel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred bradley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bronfman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coleman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook sh", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brock university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberta provincial police barracks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberta provincial police", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rocky mountains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crowsnest pass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coleman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unites states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontario", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:13:29.000+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15139380, "moreResultsAvailable": 15139280, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512638009000&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 859}
