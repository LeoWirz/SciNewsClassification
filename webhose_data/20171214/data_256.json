His vision about the house & techno scene has found a home on labels like District, Raw, One Records, La Vie En Rose , under his own name or various aliases, like the Lowwax & Terms (together with his good friend Berna) as the debut EP for his own label, Underyourseat a release that feeder.ro has reviewed a few months ago. Now part of Hector\u2019s Vatos Locos crew, Javier Carballo steps up to the next level of his already prodigious career: a fresh double vinyl named Silver Smile , to be released at VL Recordings in January 2018 ( pre-order )! \nVatos, laid-back, underground, dance \nWhen I want to chill out\u2026 I go to the beach My mom always said\u2026 please take a Jacket A proper party needs\u2026 Music Sometimes I get nostalgic about\u2026 Family One of the best gifts from a friend\u2026 a record The last app I checked on my phone\u2026 Instagram I like animals\u2026 I prefer plants Some underground venues\u2026 CDV, Mood Club A snack I can\u2019t refuse\u2026 Crisps 3 artists I love\u2026 Michael Jackson, Villalobos, Mathew Herbert \nVixi: Hello, Javier, we\u2019re happy to talk to you in the feeder insider series. You were born in the sunny Canary Islands, where you started to DJ and moved to Berlin for quite some time. Why did you trade your home on the island for the colder Berlin? \nJavier Carballo: Hello, well the only reason I moved to Berlin was to be close to the Berlin Music Scene, this allowed me to learn new sounds and growing as an artist. At the moment, I\u2019m living in London for the same reason. \n\nVixi: What got you into music and what inspires you to go on? \nJavier Carballo: Since I was a child, I have always loved music, listening to my father\u2019s records, radio etc. I started listening to electronic music when I was 10 years old, it was introduced to me by my cousin. He had some DJ friends, and I don\u2019t know exactly when the moment was, but when I heard them I got obsessed with electronic music. \nAfter that, I couldn\u2019t stop listening or dancing. \nOver the next few years, my love for electronic music grew and at the age of 14, I was mixing my first house and techno records. At the moment, I can\u2019t imagine my life without music. \nVixi: How does the Vatos Locos constantly evolve into such dynamic expressions? What makes the connection between you as a crew work so well? \nJavier Carballo: Vatos Locos is a new but solid platform, we are a heterogeneous group of artists and that\u2019s the main reason for our success and our special vibe. We always try to support each other and share our ideas and our way of feeling the music. \n\nVixi: How much planning goes into your Under Your Seat parties? What are your favourite perks of establishing a regular night? \nJavier Carballo: After 10 years, Underyourseat became a solid brand. Originally, we started out just doing a few club nights, but now we are a serious promoter company, behind some of the biggest projects in Gran Canaria. We run around 10 events per year, I\u2019d like to say thanks for the important work of my partner, Berna, who offers brilliant support and is an amazing DJ. \nVixi: Tribal rhythms rooted in pure techno, crisp percussions and a techy groove that spreads on 2 records make up for your next release, Silver Smile, on VL Recordings. What are the key elements that link up all the tracks from this EP? \nJavier Carballo: All tracks on this EP were made with Vatos Locos in mind, that\u2019s the connection between them. They were done at the same time with the same idea and feeling, not just 8 random tracks. You can find peak time tracks, after party tracks, Deep, minimal or techno. I really did this work without pressure, just going with the flow. \nVixi: It\u2019s delightful to premiere Reborn 4416 on feeder sound , thank you. Is there a story behind the track\u2019s name? At what point during a DJ set do you think Reborn 4416 will have the most powerful effect on the dance floor? \nJavier Carballo: I did feel reborn after a difficult situation in my life and the music helped me to feel alive again, as always. That\u2019s why the track is named this way. I think \u201cReborn\u201d is perfect for the early hours at an after party. \n\nVixi: Let\u2019s go a bit deeper into Javier\u2019s creative flow. What is the main gear you use in your studio setup and how long does it take you to transform a simple idea into a tune ready to be released into the underground? \nJavier Carballo: Ok I\u2019m working with some hardware and software with Logic Audio. In my productions, you can hear my: Nord Lead, Korg Monologue, Roland Tr09, Machine and Mpc 2500. \nOf course, depending on my mood and my inspiration, sometimes I only need a day to finish a track, other times it can take ages. \nVixi: You\u2019ve played all over Europe, from London\u2019s Fabric to Romania\u2019s Sunwaves, and this year\u2019s edition inspired you to perform for 12 long hours. Is there a different vibe on the Romanian dance floor comparing to some other places you played? \nJavier Carballo: Of course, every place has something different, but in Mamaia, I could feel that the people who were on the dancefloor were just enjoying the trip with the artist. They really know how to do it, everyone is under pressure at Sunwaves. That\u2019s amazing. \n\nVixi: With you, the feeder insider series reaches 127 interviews. What do you think is the present role of online media for artists and their audiences? \nJavier Carballo: In modern times, I think the broadcasting of our art is really important, and online media allow us to show our music and what we are doing to all parts of the world. People can be updated with new artists, new sounds, new parties and new initiatives. \nIt is a new way to communicate and socialize. \nWords by Vixi Pixi", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "javier carballo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "javier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "underyourseat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mathew herbert  vixi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la vie en rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hector", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "villalobos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vixi pixi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crisps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vatos locos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korg monologue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "logic audio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mood club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "one records", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mediterranean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gran canaria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canary islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sunwaves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mamaia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:52.078+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a7b5fceebbed4cf5c5809f452e742199c952bbff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyvjVsGfp7e4kbLDjA1O5ls-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a7b5fceebbed4cf5c5809f452e742199c952bbff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyvjVsGfp7e4kbLDjA1O5ls-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "#include <stdio.h>\r\n\r\nint main(void) {\r\n\r\nint n;\r\nint i;\r\nint laskuri;\r\n\r\n\r\nprintf(\"Anna nelion sivun pituus\\n\");\r\nscanf(\"%d\", &n);\r\n\r\nif (n<=20) {\r\n\r\n    for(i = 0 ;

Klaster je finalizovao izradu pomenutog sajta, a slijede intenzivne aktivnosti na ugovoranju saradnje sa klijentima, nakon \u010dega \u0107e isti biti stavljen u funkciju i javan. \nIdeja projekta je da svim posjetiocima i klijentima roomssee.com obezbijedi najbolji servis smje\u0161taja i vanpansionske aktivnosti, (izleti, restorani, rentacar, taxi, helikopter, balon, krstarenje i sl.) i sve \u0161to je gostu potrebno pru\u017eiti tokom boravka, kako bi mu odmor i posjeta ostali u pozitivnom sje\u0107anju i da bi ga naravno dobili kao promotera i gosta koji \u0107e opet posjetiti Crnu Goru.

Tako\u0111e, osim smje\u0161tajnih kapaciteta bi kasnije objedinjavali i ostale djelatnosti koje su u korelaciji sa turizmom, kao \u0161to su rezervacije restorana, renta cara, jahti, i ostalih srodnih djelatnosti. \n\u201cU momentu smo potpisivanja ugovora sa hotelima i malim privrednicima, izdavaocima smje\u0161taja. Kada se popuni dovoljno baza i uspostavi da svaki grad ima dovoljan broj predstavnika, aktivira\u0107e se sajt i nadam se da \u0107emo za sljede\u0107u sezonu krenuti sa novim kvalitetom i uspje\u0161nom ponudom na crnogorskom tr\u017ei\u0161tu po pitanju turisti\u010dke ponude.

Ova ideja koju razvijamo je izuzetno korisna i tra\u017ei uklju\u010divanje mnogih segmenata na nivou dr\u017eave i turizma i turisti\u010dkih organizacija, te da bi ovaj projekat uspio treba da se anga\u017euje veliki broj ljudi a smatramo da to daje novi i veliki kvalitet turisti\u010dkoj ponudi Crne Gore\u201d, kazao je Igor Draga\u0161, jedan od osniva\u010da Edukativnog centra za informacione tehnologije.

Bud\u017eet programa ove godine iznosio je 100 hiljada eura i ugovorena subvencija je 98 hiljada eura \u0161to zna\u010di da smo skoro u kompletnom raspolo\u017eivom iznosu ugovorili subvenciju za klastere. Mi smo do sada uglavnom davali prioritet klasterima koji djeluju u Sjevernom regionu, kao manje razvijenom, a samim tim i djelatnostima koje su vezane za turizam, preradu poljoprivrednih proizvoda i sli\u010dno, ali tako\u0111e svakako nam je drago da podr\u017eimo i druge inicijative kao \u0161to je konkretno podr\u0161ka ovom klasteru koji se bavi informacionim tehnologijma. Intenzivno pratimo realizaciju svih projekata jer je to obostrani interes, i sa na\u0161e strane, i sa strane korisnika programa, da u cjelosti realizuju svoje projekte. To nama daje dobru osnovu da obezbijedimo sredstva i za sljede\u0107u godinu, na istom ili ve\u0107em nivou\u201d, kazala je Milena Joveti\u0107, savjetnica u Direktoratu za razvoj u okviru Ministarstva ekonomije. \nMinistarstvo ekonomije u kontinuitetu prati realizaciju svih sedam projekata, a klasterima je na raspolaganju i tehni\u010dka podr\u0161ka u cilju uspje\u0161ne finalizacije svih planiranih aktivnosti, koju Ministartvo pru\u017ea u saradnji sa UNDP-em u okviru projekta \u201eUnapre\u0111enje konkurentnosti privrede u Crnoj Gori\u201c. \nB.M. \u017delite i vi da pi\u0161ete za Crnu Goru?

TW/CN icon: \"healing (a photo of me and Hannah curled up together, naked, with Hannah's head resting on my legs and my arms around/over them. it's colored in violet with a fractal overlay of purple, blue, and green.)\" being triggered is literal torture, not mere dislike or discomfort. your thoughts can get stuck in loops that take outside intervention to fix. pressuring someone into a sensory experience (taste touch smell sound sight) may force people to relive trauma. don't. The wrong therapist is a waste of time and it will wear you down trying to get help from them. if you don't click, move on as quickly as you can. it can look like laziness when people are literally doing their best because people have different amounts of energy. falling in love or experiencing lots of joy doesn't cure chemical depression. Not even if it is literally the best thing you have ever experienced. after a depression crisis is over, the recovery starts, but it can be long. survival stress is cumulative and causes depression. If someone is scrambling to survive, expecting them to be reliable and present at any given point is unrealistic and sometimes cruel. Anika prompted me to share my experience with mental illness and how it has influenced [my] life or personality .I don't know exactly when I first became depressed but it developed between age 8 and 12, and by the time I was 13 I was praying almost all day every day for God to kill me. I didn't feel like I had the right to end my life or I would have. It eased up somewhat when I finally got my first real friend at 13, but it was still a fairly constant state for me until after I got out of my parents' house, got married, and went through 2 years of therapy for the sexual abuse I experienced as a child. [ ] --- trigger: fear of unknown men, panic --- During that 2 years, I was deeply afraid of all male strangers. When the apartment sent men around with leaf-blowers, I hid in the bedroom to put 2 doors between us. I held the axe and my breath and waited until I couldn't hear them any more. I knew, logically, that these people were unlikely to attack me. But logic didn't enter into it because I was in a state of triggered panic. I use the word triggered only very deliberately. Each time I knew men were within 10 feet of my doors or windows I was in a state of utter unthinking panic until they left. Heart pounding panic like you might feel if a bear is that close and staring right at you and growling. I couldn't go out alone. For months even going to the mailbox was too terrifying. (when I finally did go that 200 feet alone, I felt so proud of myself!).--- end TW about terror of unknown men --- [ ] --- trigger: penetrative sex causing flashback-like thoughts ---The worst part was the triggers that would happen every time I had sex, starting with the first time I tried to have consensual penetrative sex. My body reacted by closing up. It felt horrible and I felt so guilty for not being able to do it, but I literally could not, no matter how much I wanted to! It got worse from there -- I started having horrible intrusive visions of children being violated whenever I would try to have sex that involved penetration. It was extremely difficult to think of sex as anything other than a source of pain, shame, loneliness, terror, and guilt. And I was so disappointed because with my conscious self, I wanted it! but my subconscious was much stronger.--- end TW about penetrative sex --- Relatedly, memories attach to weird things so don't ever insist that someone watch, listen to, smell, or taste things! because maybe that makes them feel a violation again in their mind, and they shouldn't have to tell you about it to get you to stop. Sometimes mental avoidance is an absolutely necessary coping strategy and if someone has to tell you \"that makes me remember [traumatic event]\" then you may be breaking their ability to stay out of a horrible loop of trauma replay.The fear and intrusive thoughts were my main issue in that period of mental illness, but the amount of work I had to do on those things was so much that it made me feel hopeless. I felt like I would never get better. I wondered why bother living if every future day was going to involve reliving the worst feelings I had ever experienced. I kept going because I had a supportive partner who treated my healing as an important contribution he was making to the world.Then about a year in, after three failed therapists and one therapist retiring, I found a therapist that I actually clicked with: one who had experienced worse trauma than I had and was now so free of triggers that they could sit next to their abuser without fear. The fact that they had healed that much made me feel that surely I could too, but it still was a long journey with a lot of pain in it.Eventually we worked through a lot of previous traumas and I started to feel less scared and I was able to control my thoughts again. I started to feel normal, back to my old self. I still was sensitive to certain words, and movies with realistic (true to the experience of a victim, not glamorized rape myths) sexual abuse or rape would trigger me and make it so that my mind was trapped in a loop feeling that experience over and over, but those instances happened less and less often. I was able to go back to work. I was able to interact with strangers and go places by myself. I was able to perform the minimum required, like I had been before I started therapy. [ being not-depressed is amazing ] Then there came a day when I suddenly realized that doing things didn't feel like slogging through cold mud. I even had energy to spare! I could be cheerful in the face of grumpiness! I could be social with strangers for hours and still do stuff when I got home - LOTS of stuff! I suddenly realized that I had never been lazy -- it was actually that I had lacked the energy to do more. All my energy had been going to running coping programs for the abuse that I endured. When I didn't need to spend energy coping because I had processed enough of it, all that energy welled up and sprang out of me. I was so magical, so loving, so creative. I was outgoing, as I always knew my true self was. I felt able . I was not-depressed from 2006 to 2010, then had 8 months of depression, then was not-depressed again from mid-2011 to mid-2012. I was so, so active and productive in those 6 years, to the point that it boggles my mind now. So through all that I learned that sometimes a thing you think everyone can do is literally impossible for some people, and that when people say they can't, it's not just an irresponsible way of saying \"won't.\" If you can understand only one thing about mental illness, I want you to understand that you can't tell WHY someone can't do a thing and there isn't always external proof. You just have to trust them.Later, I went into depression again because I spent more energy than I had, day after day, without getting nourished . It sounds like nothing, but I was more depressed from that than I was about the abuse, because with the abuse at least I got a clear path to healing, I got reassurance that healing was possible, and all kind people were supportive. Even kind people are generally not supportive of healing from depression that has \"no real reason\" and the acceptable \"real\" reasons are very limited. The attitude is \"get over it already.\"Not long after I realized the cause of that depression, I fixed the cause and began the most nourishing and healing connection of my life -- the thing I had always yearned for since I was small. Even though I had this new source of brilliant joy, I couldn't really feel it because the pain had worn such a rut in my brain that I couldn't get out. I could not access the happiness I knew my experiences should be giving me. [ every day I thought it could not get worse ] Every day I thought surely this is the worst it can get -- and then the next day was worse. It was so bad that I could not access any feelings except despair; I could not even care about the suffering of others, which has always been one of my primary motivations. When I thought about injustice and suffering and had no emotional response, I felt I had died inside and was no longer a person. Finally I got desperate enough to go to the clinic and get medicine, which formed a protective layer over the bottom of the rut and allowed me to slowly heal, layer by layer, until the rut was gone. But then the protective layer kept me from feeling things deeply which started to make me feel like life was pointless, so I weaned myself off against medical advice. I know my own brain and I knew I no longer needed it because it had started to cause me harm rather than good.That experience taught me that even with a perfect situation, even in a time that should be your happiest, if the chemicals in your brain are messed up you are not going to be able to be happy. The chemistry of your brain is stronger than the strongest will. Just like you can't will yourself out of mono, you can't will yourself out of depression.Even though the crisis-level depression was over after 8 months of medication, the depression was not gone. It's like after a long illness when it finally breaks -- the healing is not done because the sickness is over, because your body has to recover from the battle. My mind had to recover, and that process was slowed by the constant and massive amount of energy I had to put into surviving because my job didn't pay enough for me to live on. For a while that process was not just slowed but reversed by the exhaustion of scraping a survival on what I could beg from my biofamily while I tried to convince employers that I was a valuable person and they should hire me and pay me a living wage. [ survival stress ] When your ability to feed and shelter yourself is in constant doubt, there is no rest from the emotional and mental drain. Even when you are not actively worrying, it takes so much energy to keep it out of your conscious mind. Daily survival stress is cumulative and from myself and others I have seen, it always creates depression. Extra energy exists in a world of unicorns and dragons, and to think that you can have it while fighting to survive is a laugh.A year ago I finally found a job that is perfect for me and pays me a living wage. Since then I have begun healing again, very slowly. I have only just now started feeling like I can actually count on this job, despite always doing my best and often getting appreciative comments from coworkers. I have only in the past few months started feeling like I can count on being able to stay in the place where I live. I also have SAD (seasonal affective depression) but I have mostly learned how to cope with this so that it doesn't affect me too much. The most important part is that I have to get enough sleep on a fairly regular sleep schedule, and I HAVE to get up at LEAST three hours before dark. I have to get outside every day even if it's just 5 min, even if there is no sun. I need to drink lots of hot drinks (coffee, hot chocolate, tea) and try to stay as warm as possible. I need to eat regularly. I need to use my sunlight lamp as close to daily as I can manage.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anika", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hannah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tw", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:54.060+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89ce3c56641f3914560b9951e4a7f52d949d2068", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2KocwtRVxm1L9SXRuE2_Ng-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "89ce3c56641f3914560b9951e4a7f52d949d2068", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2KocwtRVxm1L9SXRuE2_Ng-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "CREATE TABLE `Kurs05` (`Id_kursu` Int(6), `Data_pocz` DATETIME, `Data_konc` DATETIME, `Nr_Instruktora` Int(6), `Nr_Kursanta` Int(6), `Nr_Samochodu` Varchar(7), `Zdal` Varchar(5), `Wprowadzil` Varchar(30));\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE `Kursant05` (`Nr_kursanta` Int(6) PRIMAR' at line 1\r\nMariaDB [05]> CREATE TABLE `Kursant05` (`Nr_kursanta` Int(6) PRIMARY KEY, `PESEL` Int(11), `Nazwisko_Kursanta` Varchar(30), `Imie_Kurstanta` Varchar(30), `Drugie_Imie_Kursanta` Varchar(30), `Kategoria_zdawana` Varchar(10), `Wprowadzil` Varchar(30));", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:54.078+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4092012961ab3ec0ba83be38e13494deb51770b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMvdw_t.7dQZrAcCpMtK.VR5S8kfgUckZfO_vzX_3mdMIBDB6PJShi0UAbx3M3olZL_bjZKBlUzVxNhevPF8xXftsHPJBUvYRbA-", "site_full": "videohena.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://videohena.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Laughter and Culture", "title": "Why People Need Waste Management Henrico VA Services", "title_full": "Why People Need Waste Management Henrico VA Services", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "BN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4092012961ab3ec0ba83be38e13494deb51770b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMvdw_t.7dQZrAcCpMtK.VR5S8kfgUckZfO_vzX_3mdMIBDB6PJShi0UAbx3M3olZL_bjZKBlUzVxNhevPF8xXftsHPJBUvYRbA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Quiz tube (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Why People Need Waste Management Henrico VA Services", "text": "By Lisa Taylor \n\nGarbage is one of the challenges facing modern communities in this day and age.

They want to revive old trade routes,\" he said.\"Well, they once had land routes, yes, the Silk Road. But a maritime silk route? What's that,\" he wondered.He said that the last time Chinese ships went into the Indian Ocean was in the 15th century when Zheng He, who was a Muslim from Yunnan, sailed with his fleets of junks to India, Southeast Asia and Africa.Stating that Zheng was only an adventurer, Lintner said that after that China lost interest in the oceans.\"China never had a navy. Apart from river patrol boats in the rivers to suppress banditry in their own country, now for the first time China is developing a blue water navy,\" he said.\"They have never been in the Indian Ocean for 600 years... I don't think there is going to be war in the Himalayas. Any conflict with China is going to be in the Indian Ocean.\"In his new book, Lintner rather than India, despite being seen as the provocateur of 1962 Sino-Indian conflict, it was actually China that started planning the war in 1959, much before then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru launched the Forward Policy in the border areas.Questioning Neville Maxwell's book \"India's China War\" that opined that India provoked the war with China, Lintner said that this did not make sense given the realities on the ground.Pointing out that the Forward Policy of India was adopted only in November 1961, the Swedish journalist, known for his expertise on southeast and south Asia, wondered how China was able to mobilise tens of thousands of troops in less than a year, including heavy military equipment, through one of the most difficult terrains in the world.Lintner is of the view that Maxwell must have made a misjudgment in saying that India's border issues with China could have provoked the 1962 war.Stating that in 1962 China was an extremely secretive country, Lintner said that Mao Tse-Tung's (Mao Zedong's) position in the Communist Party of China was extremely shaky after his Great Leap Forward policy in the 1950s to industrialise China turned into a disaster.\"In that kind of situation what kind of country will go to war over a disputed border?\" he questioned. \"Only a country or leader of a country who needs to unite the party, the government and the military behind him to be able to reconsolidate his grip on power.\"As to why it was India that China went to war against, Lintner said that after Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959, it became convenient for Beijing to call New Delhi the enemy coupled with the border dispute.Another reason that Lintner offered was that, with India being the leading voice of the newly independent countries in the 1950s, Mao wanted to be the leader of the Third World.Former Indian Army chief, Gen. J.J. Singh, who was one of the panellists at the book launch, said that it was high time India got under China's skin.\"We must understand the Dragon and its Middle Kingdom,\" he stated.Lt. Gen. S.L. Narasimhan (retd), a member of the National Security Advisory Board, was of the view that with ties between the then USSR and China being very low in the 1960s, Beijing wanted to prove that it was very powerful through the 1962 war.Nitin Gokhale, foounder and Editor-in-Chief of Bharatshakti.in, said that Lintner's book made two very important points: it debunked the theories of Neville Maxwell and Alistair on the causes behind the 1962 war, and that Mao Zedong used the war to purge his rivals and reinstate himself in power.

The Federal Government has however directed the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu, to end the scarcity before the weekend. With fuel stations under lock due to lack of supply, black market operators made brisk business, selling a five litre can of petrol at between N1,500 and N2,000. States like Lagos, Ogun, Kwara and Abuja are currently witnessing long queues at petrol stations, with motorists struggling to buy the commodity at few stations that had the product. Long queues of petrol tankers were observed along the Oshodi-Apapa expressway , parked by the roadsides. The drivers said they have no signal to move to the depots to load . Last week, the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, IPMAN, in Lagos, alleged that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, did not give its members enough petrol. The association also accused the corporation of no longer selling to them at N133.28 per litre and that it was impossible for them to continue selling the product at NNPC\u2019s official price of N145 per litre. The Executive Secretary, Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association, DAPPMA, Mr. Olufemi Adewole, said an increase in price of crude oil had caused a rise in prices of refined products. \u201cIt is only NNPC that is bringing products in. We also noticed a supply gap in what they brought in. It wasn\u2019t enough at a particular time and the result is what we are seeing today\u201d, he said. \u201cBut they have equally assured us that they have enough stock and that they are expecting vessels to come in. Our members have paid for PFI (pro-forma invoices) for PMS. So, once NNPC cargoes come in, we will receive the product and sell to Nigerians ,\u201d he added. Adewole explained that the reason marketers were not importing was that the landing cost of PMS had increased to about N165-N170 per litre. \u201cBut the government is saying we should sell at N145 without subsidy. That\u2019s why we have to depend on NNPC to sell to us\u201d, he added. Many stations as at Wednesday , were under lock and key. However, despite the scarcity and the high black market prices, transport fares remained unchanged. Vehicles from Mile 2 to Oshodi, maintained same old price of N100 while buses from Ikeja Along to Mile 2 also maintained same old price of N150. In a release on Monday , the NNPC warned against panic buying, saying it had enough stock to last through the festive period. \u201cFor the umpteenth time, I wish to call on all Nigerians to stop panic buying. We have sufficient products to cater for the needs of all consumers\u201d, the NNPC Group Managing Director, Dr. Maikanti Baru, said in a statement. On Tuesday , the Senate Committee on Petroleum, Downstream, said plans have been concluded for it to conduct nationwide inspection of filling stations over the fuel scarcity. \nAccording to chairman of the committee, Kabiru Marafa, the Senate would not allow unpatriotic persons put Nigerians through any form of hardship, particularly during the yuletide. \nHe noted that though the Senate had adjourned to commence budget defence, members of the committee would take time out to embark on the oversight. \nOfficials of the Department   DPR, are also on inspection of petrol stations and storage tanks across the country. \nOn Tuesday , the officials visited some stations in Abeokuta, Ogun state to check hoarding of products. \nThe Senate had also summoned the NNPC Group Managing Director, Baru on Tuesday . \nHowever, Baru could not make it to the meeting as he was due to receive an award in the U.K, although a later statement by NNPC, disclosed that Baru had canceled his trip due to the biting fuel crisis.

In 2016, we completed \u20ac200 million in share buybacks under this program.

We are committed to completing \u20ac300 million in share buybacks by year-end 2017. Current repurchases are being executed under a third party mandate granted on September 26, 2017. Under this mandate, we intend to implement share buybacks of up to \u20ac50 million in the period from November 2, 2017 up until December 31, 2017, and a further up to \u20ac50 million in the period from January 1, 2018 up to and including February 19, 2018.

In order to maintain its leadership on this market, Orange Belgium decided last year to invest in new IoT technologies based on international standards. Today Orange announces the availability of Narrow Band-IoT (NB-IoT) and LTE-M technologies, so called \"Mobile IoT\", on the whole Belgian territory, reaching nationwide coverage both indoors and outdoors. The NB-IoT and LTE-M technologies are Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) cellular network layers that will allow millions of everyday objects to be connected to the Internet of Things (IoT). LPWA technologies offer many advantages when connecting objects to the Internet of Things, such as extending the battery life of the connected equipment by up to 10 years thanks to low energy consumption, or drastically reducing the cost of the radio modules inside the devices that need to be connected. Smart furniture, smart parking and asset tracking for instance become possible. Orange turns Belgium into a Mobile IoT test lab by launching the first nationwide LPWA cellular network in Belgium Today Orange Belgium announces the nationwide roll-out of Mobile IoT on its network, as committed 1 year ago. The Mobile IoT technologies bring a different approach to LPWA technologies. Apart from the extended battery life and the minimal cost of the radio modules, NB-IoT and LTE-M: also enable full bidirectional communication between the object and the network allowing firmware software updates over the air; have the best possible mobile coverage (up to +20dB compared to 2G/4G coverage), considerably improving signal penetration inside buildings; can rely on a guaranteed connectivity abroad (roaming) on other operators' Mobile IoT networks; And they are the safest solution for IoT connectivity as it operates in licensed spectrum. Moreover, the SIM card offers secure connections thanks to LTE networks' unique capabilities in terms of authenticating and encrypting the data in transit. Gabriel Flichy, Chief Technology Officer of Orange Belgium, explains: \"The choice for Mobile IoT technologies is future-proof as it is fully consistent with the future evolution towards 5G. It will then be possible to connect objects that require very high reliability e.g. for the remote control of critical devices and automation processes. Today we are already using our Mobile IoT network together with the Flemish government for a project with connected bikes in collaboration with our partners Huawei and Sensinxs; IMEC is testing a smart plug project as part of Antwerp's City of Things program and we have teamed up with CommuniThings for smart parking solutions.We invite all application developers, system integrators and early adopters to test the advantages of Orange Mobile IoT network.\" More info on the website business.orange.be/iotstarterskit or via Overall Mobile IoT will act as the catalyst for companies to establish connections that would not have been viable with existing technologies. Consumers will see a huge variety of new products, services and applications enabled by Mobile IoT.

An independent Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital is the internationally accepted position,\" a CPI-M statement said.\"The US has taken the formal step of legalizing the illegal occupation of Palestine territories by Israel. No other country in the world has given recognition to Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\"The CPI-M said that unlike the worldwide opposition to this move, the Indian External Affairs Ministry \"has scrupulously refused to criticize the US decision.

Borsa Italiana: A Rising Giant in Europe \nThe Borsa Italiana, which is also known as the Piazza Affari, is Italy\u2019s main stock exchange. It does not just take pride in being one of the oldest stock exchanges globally; it also takes pride in being one of Europe\u2019s best stock exchanges today. It is an honour to be inside for Italgas S.p.A. as well. Needless to say, the Borsa Italiana has led the European economy\u2014 in one way or another\u2014 to become the globally influential economy that it is today. \nOn the other hand, the FTSE Milano Italia Borsa (MIB) is the country\u2019s benchmark index. Like the Borsa Italiana, it also has a meaningful impact in the entire European trade and commerce environment. Borsa Italiana \nNapoleonic Kingdom of Italy Viceroy Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais had established the Borsa Italiana in February 1808 as one of the first stock exchanges in the world. Based at Palazzo Mezzanotte, Milan, its operations had always been supervised by the government as public entity until 1998. \nThe London Stock Exchange Group had purchased the Borsa Italiana in an all-stock agreement in 2007, merging it with the London Stock Exchange. It helped Italgas S.p.A. received new audience. \nOn the Borsa Italiana, the pre-market session lasts for an hour, starting at 8:00 a.m. and ending at 9:00 a.m; the regular session lasts for 8.50 hours, starting at 9:00 a.m. and ending at 5:30 p.m.; and the post-market session lasts for 2.50 hours, starting at 6:00 p.m. and ending at 8:30 p.m. The long trading hours give way to international investors who live in countries with different time zones. Consequently, the Borsa Italiana has so much room for growth. Not all stock exchanges have trading hours this long. \nToday, the Borsa Italiana has a total market valuation of about $645 billion with over 300 companies listed on it. FTSE MIB \nThe FTSE MIB is currently operated by the FTSE. Prior to the takeover of the FTSE in June 2009, it had been operated as the S&P/MIB by the S&P. \nThe FTSE MIB tracks the 40 largest companies listed on the Borsa Italiana based on market capitalization and with respect to free-floating shares. Different companies of major sectors such as Energy, Financials, Mining, and Telecommunications are included in the FTSE MIB, which represents roughly 80% of the total market valuation on the Borsa Italiana. The components are reviewed quarterly to guarantee the best possible indication of the health of the Italian economy, which plays an important role in the success of the entire European economy. Health of Italgas S.p.A. shares attract attention of investors. \nThe FTSE MIB had hit an all-time high of 50,108.56 points, which also happens to be its best intraday high, in March 2000. On the other hand, it had hit an all-time low of 12,362.52 points in July 2012 mainly because of high borrowing costs in Europe. \nMany investors are considering Borsa Italiana stocks because of Italy\u2019s competent trade and commerce landscape. It is one of the best ways to count on the growth of the European economy regardless of whether investors are trading short-term or long-term. \nMore news for Italgas S.p.A. (BIT:IG) were recently published by: Seekingalpha.com, which released: \u201cSnam \u2013 Italgas, Is There Any Spin-Off Opportunity?\u201d on November 06, 2016. Marketwatch.com\u2018s article titled: \u201cItaly\u2019s Snam to spin off Italgas arm\u201d and published on June 29, 2016 is yet another important article. \nItalgas S.p.A., together with its subsidiaries, engages in the distribution of natural gas in Italy.   4.28 billion EUR.

Don Barker said authorities went to the center at 5125 Grove Ave. at 8 a.m. with a search warrant and met with Talbott, who agreed to cooperate in the investigation. Talbott led investigators into an office where he said records were kept but once inside, he grabbed a handgun and threatened to kill himself, Barker said. \nDrug Task Force officers tried to convince Talbott to put down the gun but when he refused, deputies twice deployed a stun gun to no effect. Talbott then fired the gun, taking his own life, Barker said. \nEmergency crews responded to the scene and pronounced Talbott dead, Barker said. \nLorain County Drug Task Force is continuing to investigate based on the search warrant, and Lorain police will handle the death investigation. \nSheriff Chief Deputy Dennis Cavanaugh said deputies seized documents while executing the search warrant, but he declined to discuss the nature of the investigation. Veterinarians are licensed by the DEA and are required to keep logs of certain controlled drugs they may use in their practices. \nAccording to the Animal Emergency Center\u2019s website, Talbott, a resident of Bay Village, was one of two veterinarians on staff. The center provides emergency care for pets after hours, on weekends and on major holidays. \nTalbott received media attention over the years for going above and beyond for animals, like last year when he took care of a golden retriever that had been shot and his left foot was stuck in a trap. \nThe dog named \u201cChance\u201d by Talbott was brought to the center by the Lorain County dog warden, and Talbott came in on his day off to do emergency surgery. \nThe staff at the center began an online fundraiser for the dog, collecting $8,485 for help pay for Chance\u2019s recovery. \nIn 2010, Talbott tried to save Amherst police K-9 Bandit after the dog\u2019s stomach had contorted and fatally cut off blood flow to other organs. Bandit was brought to the center where Talbott attempted CPR on the dog but was unsuccessful. Talbott later attended the dog\u2019s funeral. \nGreg Willey, executive director of the Friendship Animal Protective League, said Talbott was known in the community as doing anything he could to help an animal. \n\u201cHe was an amazingly sweet and compassionate person that really cared about the animals we brought in,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d \nTalbott treated \u201ccountless\u201d dogs and cats over the years from Friendship and would work with foster families who needed help for their pets. \nWilley said Talbott would try things other veterinarians might not do, such as when Willey brought him a cat whose leg had gotten caught in a trap. He said Talbott reached out to University Hospitals Elyria Medical Center to get leeches for leech therapy on the cat. \n\u201cHe was always one to try different things and take chances,\u201d Willey said. \u201cHe was really cool in that way. He was very smart and very educated and willing to do things that were outside the box to save an animal\u2019s life, and I was always very impressed with that.\u201d \nTalbott also allowed Willey to sit with the puppies that were in isolation to be treated for parvovirus, which is extremely contagious to other dogs. \n\u201cHe allowed us to do things that traditionally a lot of places wouldn\u2019t allow,\u201d Willey said. \nMany veterinary clinics only open during business hours depended on the center and sent its patients to Talbott for emergency care when they were closed. \nHe was a trusted doctor, and Willey said he was shocked to learn of the investigation by the Drug Task Force. \n\u201cHe\u2019s been a cornerstone of the community for a long time. I\u2019m sure it came as a surprise to everyone,\u201d Willey said. \n\u201cWhen they came down and told me, I stood there with my mouth hanging open. I literally couldn\u2019t believe it. He was a really strong guy and he seemed really tough, but I know he had a really soft heart and a soft heart for animals.\u201d Contact Jodi Weinberger at 329-7245 or Related Stories:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "craig talbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "don barker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wiley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jodi weinberger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dennis cavanaugh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "willey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg willey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "talbott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "drug task force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university hospitals elyria medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "friendship animal protective league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lorain county drug task force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drug enforcement administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheriff\u2019s office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "animal emergency center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lorain county animal emergency center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lorain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amherst", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lorain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bay village", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lorain county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grove ave.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:58.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9767c58cf67540999e7830b87a0f4980ac3a77df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/qp0TC1ajDjgYeZ177f4HOWMrd5dreVkRspbkuGu26MI9D3LzwatG6qfHdCfEwJH8eBwWB1gmZME-", "site_full": "67.227.255.239", "site": "67.227.255.239", "site_section": "http://67.227.255.239/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=2", "site_categories": ["adult", "business", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Gaming Discussion - NeoGAF", "title": "Lawmaker who called out Star Wars Battlefront 2 lays out plans for anti-loot box law", "title_full": "Lawmaker who called out Star Wars Battlefront 2 lays out plans for anti-loot box law - NeoGAF", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 42, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "http://www.neogaf.com/forum/images/neogaf2/icon_social.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "87ebf14fde21eb1b2eb127fa110010355876aaf0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/qp0TC1ajDjgYeZ177f4HOWMrd5dreVkRspbkuGu26MI9D3LzwatG6qfHdCfEwJH8oyybS5y.NEcw6K_uGIwOqw--", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "BANGS", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "[Quote: =TacoMasters;253093239]The last thing we need is a political involvement in video games that catches the attention of the government.[/Quote: ]\nThis so hard.

is a definite asset. People generally react well to others that greet them with a healthy white smile. Unfortunately, the opposite is also true. Poor teeth, with some of them missing and others obviously discoloured or rotten, create a very poor impression. Good oral health is very important and should never be seen as less important than other areas of health. Luckily, with an affordable Andover dentist there is no reason to suffer from bad teeth and oral disease.\n\nIt is a misconception that dentists are concerned with the teeth exclusively. They treat many oral diseases. They pay attention to the gums, the tongue and the soft tissue inside the mouth too. The mouth can easily develop a variety of problems. This is because it is almost always moist and this creates a breeding ground for many types of bacteria. The food and drink that humans consume can cause cavities.\n\nFar too many people still only see a dental practitioner when they experience pain or discomfort. It is vitally important to visit the dental clinic at least twice every year, even if there are no apparent problems. Latent problems are often identified during these routine visits. The practitioner can then act quickly and prevent a more serious problem from developing. The earlier a problem is treated, the less expensive it will be.\n\nMost people are not aware that there are other diseases, such as heart conditions and certain types of cancers, that manifest tell tale signs in the mouth long before symptoms manifest elsewhere in the body. Routine visits to the dental clinic often lead to a very early diagnoses of such diseases. This means that the latent disease can be treated successfully because it was caught at such an early stage.\n\nPoor oral health, especially missing and rotten teeth and bad breath do not affect the physical health of the sufferer. In many cases it can also lead to a variety of psychological problems. These patients often come across as surly and unfriendly, because they are too ashamed to smile. Many people avoid social contact and there have been cases of severe depression developing.\n\nVisits to the dental clinic no longer means pain and severe discomfort. There have been huge advances in the various treatment options that dentists have and their equipment, too, has become very advanced. Problems such as discoloured and obviously fake prosthesis are a thing of the past. Many dental treatment programs produce permanent results. Almost no dental procedure involves pain any longer.\n\nThe majority of oral health problems can be traced back to poor oral hygiene. This is sad, because a good oral health regime is not costly and it does not require much time each day. The teeth must be brushed two times a day at least. The tongue and the gums must also be brush and it is vital to use a good quality brush. All dentists can recommend the brushes and other dental hygiene products that will be best for their patients.\n\nDentists play an important role in the overall health of every person. Everyone wants to boast a beautiful smile. The way to obtain that is to pay attention to oral health issues and to see a dental practitioner regularly.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are looking for the facts about an affordable Andover dentist , visit our website today.
