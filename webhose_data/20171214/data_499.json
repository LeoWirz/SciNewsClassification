I probably need not remind anyone of the last great bust \u2013 the 2008/2009 financial meltdown \u2013 but for the sadists among us, data from the American Institute of Architects indicates that on average, architecture firms in the US faced a 40% decline in revenue, and a 30% lay off in staff. Gensler shed 750 people from their 3,000 strong work force. These statistics represent the strongest negative impact on a professional service industry, and one of the biggest across all industries. \nFast-forward 10 years and we\u2019re in the grips of another great boom. 2017 data published by Forbes shows professional consultancy services related to construction is the second fastest growing industry in the United States. Anecdotally it seems the UK, Australia and New Zealand are in similar boats. In a single year Zaha Hadid architects doubled in size. \nSo in a rising tide, how do you ensure you don\u2019t get swept away? Put another way, I wanted to know if there was an alternative to the boom and bust model and if there was, what might be the average level of organic growth? To do this, I took my sample of 109 firms from Design Intelligence and divided the size of each firm by the number of years since the firm\u2019s inception, creating a very crude speed of growth statistic. Values ranged from 98 (Gensler) to 1. The average for all firms was 6.31 people per year. Only 15.5% of firms managed to sustain an average growth rate of 10 people per year. Against this backdrop, the speed of growth we have seen recently in many firms seems highly-unsustainable. \nEach year Architect Magazine ranks America\u2019s Top 50 architecture practices. Unlike other construction media, who tend to rank firms by number of people or total revenue, Architect Magazine has a robust methodology for scoring firms across three categories: Business, Sustainability and Design. \nAssuming that the old adage of business begetting business would hold true, I expected these high-performing firms to be growing at a much faster rate. I was wrong, the average growth rate of the best 50 architecture firms in America is 6.89 people per year. Completely counter to intuition, the 10 firms that ranked the highest according to business performance actually had a slower average growth rate of 3.85 people per year, while the 10 firms that ranked the highest on design quality had an average growth rate of 4.36. \nSo to answer the original question about whether you're growing too fast, if you desire to be a profitable design-centric firm and you have been growing at more than five people a year, there\u2019s a good chance your ship might run aground if the economic tide goes out. \nUltimately what I believe these findings point to is the importance of creating a mechanism to constrain growth. William Rawn Associates \u2013 the best financial performer on Architect Magazine\u2019s Top 50 \u2013 have a simple rule: they limit themselves to six projects in design at any given time. By artificially constraining growth, William Rawn only get bigger when they get better. By relentlessly sticking to this rule they\u2019re far less likely to fall mercy to market forces. \nI would wager a pretty penny that firms like William Rawn who adopt a slower, more deliberate approach to growth not only perform better financially, but have greater staff retention and consistently achieve higher-quality design outcomes over the long-term than those who grow fast and shrink quicker. I don\u2019t have any data to support that sweeping generalisation, only the fact that at 6\u20196, growth is something I know a little bit about.

Easley, AP Kentucky GOP rejects governor's call for resignations 1 / 1 Back to Gallery FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Kentucky's Republican governor asked his party on Saturday to call for the resignation of four GOP lawmakers who signed a secret sexual harassment settlement, but party leaders rejected it in a move the governor said \"speaks to the fact that we've got real problems.\"\nThe Republican Party of Kentucky's Central Committee held its regular meeting on Saturday. Party Chairman Mac Brown introduced a resolution that condemned \"proven sexual harassment in any form committed by any public servant in the state of Kentucky.\"\nGov. Matt Bevin tried to amend the resolution so it would also call for the resignation of any lawmaker who paid to settle a sexual harassment claim. Four Republican lawmakers settled such a claim in October. But Bevin's amendment failed by a vote of 48-38.\n\"It was not a proud day for the Republican Party. It speaks to the fact that we've got real problems, including at the highest levels,\" Bevin said in an interview after the vote. \"There were plenty who actually believed even Republicans should not be allowed to sexually harass people, but there are many who think that's OK as long as you are a Republican. That's a problem.\"\nLATEST SFGATE VIDEOS Now Playing: Now Playing Behind the scenes: \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" sfgate Star Wars: The Last Jedi (official trailer) sfgate Muni bus and streetcar collide sfgate Time lapse of Bay Area traffic sfgate Mountain lion and kitten spotted for first time since fire sfgate Santa Rosa firefighters headed south to fight LA blaze sfgate The best views in Russian Hill sfgate Ventura resident shows view of massive fire sfgate Oakland city workers go on strike sfgate Smoke from Creek Fire smothers Lake View Terrace in Los Angeles sfgate A news release from the Republican Party of Kentucky said the resolution that did pass \"strongly\" condemns sexual harassment. Party Executive Director Sarah Van Wallaghen said it \"sends a strong message that the Republican Party of Kentucky will not condone inappropriate behavior, whether in the halls of the General Assembly or in the workplace of any ordinary Kentuckian.\"\nBut Bevin said without calling for resignations, the resolution is \"like being against cancer. ... It kind of goes without saying.\"\nRepublican state Rep. Bam Carney did not attend the meeting, but posted on his Twitter account that \"today was a good day for democracy and the rule of law, while what appears to be a personal agenda going down to defeat.\"\nThe vote and Bevin's comments are evidence of the growing rift among Kentucky's majority political party following the revelation that four Republicans secretly settled a sexual harassment claim outside of court with a former member of the House GOP Caucus' staff. The settlement included former House Speaker Jeff Hoover, who resigned his leadership position last month but remains in the Legislature.\nHoover has denied sexual harassment but said he sent inappropriate but consensual text messages. Among the other lawmakers named in the settlement, Rep. Brian Linder of Dry Ridge has publicly apologized. Rep. Jim DeCesare of Bowling Green has declined to comment, but told a Bowling Green TV station he has \"done nothing to be ashamed of.\" Rep. Michael Meredith of Oakland has not commented.\nFriday, acting House Speaker David Osborne asked the Legislative Ethics Commission to use its subpoena power to get a copy of the settlement and to find out whether any part of it was paid for by political donors or lobbyists.\nBevin said some who spoke against his amendment said the party should wait until the ethics commission can finish its investigation before asking for anyone to resign. But Bevin called that argument \"an absolute facade,\" saying the fact that lawmakers agreed to the settlement is all the evidence needed for them to resign.\n\"It is so black and white ... I don't even see where there is a question here,\" Bevin said.\nBevin said he draws a distinction between the Kentucky lawmakers who paid money to secretly settle a sexual harassment claim and someone like Alabama Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, who has steadfastly denied allegations he molested or assaulted children. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and others have said they believe the women and Moore should drop out of the race.\n\"I don't know what Roy Moore did.

Ulyukayev who is on trial for allegedly taking a $2 million bribe is expected to deliver... \nBy NATALIYA VASILYEVAAssociated Press \nMOSCOW (AP) - Wrapping up one of Russia's most high-profile trials of the year, a former economic development minister charged with bribery on Thursday accused an oil executive of setting him up and apologized for \"turning back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nAlexei Ulyukayev, the highest-ranking Russian official to be arrested since 1993, was detained last year at the headquarters of Russia's largest oil producer, the state-owned Rosneft, after a sting operation by Russia's main intelligence agency. Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. \nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. \n\"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. \nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared - what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\" \nUlyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. \nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop. \nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev's actions \"are undermining the authority of the government.\" \nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \"those absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised. I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts. When you're doing all right, you shamelessly turn your back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nUlyukayev asked for \"people's\" forgiveness and pledged to devote rest of his life to \"defending people's interests.\" \nThe court is expected to deliver the verdict next week.

Then a second count radically inverted this tendency, putting incumbent Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez as the victor. With protests of fraud, the court decided to suspend the final publication of the results. Both candidates called on their supporters to defend victory on the streets . \nBut in the following days, Nasralla denounced that opposition protests were being infiltrated by outside elements, thus creating an image of a country in chaos. It was the perfect excuse for minister Jorge Ram\u00f3n Hern\u00e1ndez, who took no time in announcing the suspension of constitutional rights on Friday night, for a period of 10 days. However, as constitutional law experts have stressed, this decree could only be approved by the President in a cabinet meeting. \nThe curfew specifically forbids people from going out on the streets between 6PM and 6AM. Soon after the images of the first dead people started circulating on social media. But that is not enough for some people to lose sleep\u2026 \nThe long road towards democracy \nAs soon as the Electoral Court announced the vote swing favouring Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, Nasralla announced that the elections were \u201cbeing stolen\u201d and that this time he would not allow it, referring to the 2013 elections in which he also ran, garnering 13% of the vote. Nasralla was then the candidate for the Anti-Corruption party that he had co-founded. \nIn September 2014, the director of the Honduran Institute for Social Security was seized by the police for a theft estimated at 335 million dollars. The government of Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez declared that fighting corruption was to become a priority and signed agreements with several international organisations dedicated to transparency. \nMeanwhile, the period after the 2009 coup has been extremely hard on Hondurans, who have valiantly resisted against the repression and the impunity of state agents. In 2015, the Honduran people marched every week with torches to protest against the dictatorship they faced, but the state carried on assassinating social leaders. The Honduran people have been subjected by the system to extreme violence, but there seem to be no alternative sight, as an opposition movement had yet to be unified. \nIn early July 2017, after months of waiting and only a day before the deadline, the Electoral Court registered the candidacy from the Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship. This coalition, coordinated by the ousted former president Manuel Zelaya, rallies multiple political forces around a social and democratic program: transparency and rooting out corruption; an alternative economic system with restructured productive sectors; investment in public services such as education, healthcare and housing; environmental protection, etc. \nIn the elections inside the Anticorruption Party earlier this year, the party did not choose its co-founder Salvador Nasralla as general secretary. Then Nasralla became the candidate for the Opposition Alliance due to his popularity as a former sports journalist. \nAre democracy and impunity compatible? \nIt is important to take into account the difficulty in mobilising voters in a country immersed in extreme, structural violence. Honduras is one of the most dangerous countries in the world. Its murder rate is only comparable to the situation of countries during wars, such as Iraq! In the run-up to the elections there has been an escalation of violence. In the weeks leading to the November 26 poll, activists from both Opposition Alliance and the governing party were attacked. \nThe murder of activist Berta C\u00e1ceres in March 2015 became engraved in the minds of an entire generation. Since then, banners, murals and posters have multiplied to commemorate the courage she showed in her struggle against all odds. The slogan \u201cBerta lives, she has multiplied\u201d has spread beyond the borders of this small country. Berta had become renowned around the world for her role in the struggles of her organisation, COPINH. Her case is far from unique: for years, environmental activists have been harassed and attacked with impunity. \nIn this context, the daughters of C\u00e1ceres, Laura and Bertha Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, quickly moved to the spotlight and denounced the responsibility of Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s government: \nthe oligarchic groups have great influence, they mobilize the army to repress people. We should point out that since the 2009 coup many military people have become shareholders in extractive industry projects (hydroelectric, mining, and others). But the corrupt mafias also allow for the organization of criminal groups that work in coordination with major corporations. \nIn early November, an independent report rattled a lot of cages. Finally the complicity of the state in Berta C\u00e1ceres\u2019 assassination was confirmed, in line with the strong suspicions held by relatives and friends from the very beginning. The report\u2019s authors are adamant: \nAmong the chat exchanges between DESA staff members, the experts could detect that there was permanent contact between the company and state security forces, such as the Seguridad y Polic\u00eda Preventiva. For example, only 14 hours after Berta\u2019s murder, there were messages between DESA managers and staff members revealing that they had asked public officials for help in being shielded from any investigation. \nConsequently Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez had every interest in hiding the incestuous links between the state and multinational corporations. It is no coincidence that during his term the security budget was increased and special military forces were created. The $17.3 million provided in security aid by the United States seem to pose no problem to our democracies. \nBut the plot thickens: the president of the Constitutional Court, David Matamoros, is a relative of Dennis Matamoros Batson, a legal counsel of a company that provides services for DESA, the company accused of playing a role in the assassination of Berta C\u00e1ceres. \nOne of the things at stake in the current Honduran elections is to get rid, once and for all, of this culture of political impunity. \nVenezuela, an ever present scarecrow in elections all over the world \nThe media campaign for the Honduran elections was another opportunity to attack Venezuela. The Spanish CNN channel posed the crucial question of our time to Nasralla: \u201cWhat is your position concerning Venezuela?\u201d. And he responded \u201cthe Venezuelan problems should be solved by Venezuelans, just like Honduran problems should be solved by Hondurans\u201d \u2026 and adding that should Venezuela sell oil at low prices Honduras would not complain\u2026 \nTo prove Venezuelan interference in the electoral process, secretary of the right-wing National Party Juan Diego Zelaya showed in the same program a photo of Manuel Zelaya, now coordinator of the Opposition Alliance, in a car next to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. But he did not mention the context of said photo, which is almost 10 years old! After the coup against Zelaya in 2009, Maduro was one of the few Latin American foreign ministers who committed personally to taking Zelaya to the Honduran border and risking his life to defend democracy in Honduras. But this is about taking advantage of the media propaganda of him being a dictator to demonise the Opposition Alliance\u2026 \nFor the dominant ideology, raising the Venezuelan scarecrow is a tactic to draw attention away from the shortcomings of governments that embrace economic policies that hinge on the almighty \u201cfree market\u201d. Cultivating amnesia and distorting the historical examples of social achievements that challenge powerful elites is a tried and tested propaganda technique, which in this case has the virtue of ignoring the needs of the Honduran population! The most surreal moment happened when the government of Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez expelled the Venezuelan band Los Guaragaos, who were going to play at an opposition rally. Has Latin American folk music become a weapon of mass destruction against elites in power? (1) \nThe lesson of the Honduran people \nThe Opposition Alliance had demanded total transparency in the special tallying process announced by the Electoral Court, and sent a letter detailing 11 necessary conditions for them to accept the result. But the Court did not respect these conditions, and the Alliance has called on people to defy the curfew and defend the victory stolen via electoral fraud. Nasralla has pointed the finger at president Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez and Electoral Court president David Matamoros as the ones responsible for the situation. \nIt is true that elections are just a single moment in people\u2019s lives. But in Central America, where institutions have done nothing to defend quality public services, representatives have destroyed whatever was left by raiding social security funds, there are crucial matters at stake. People would have plenty of reasons to adhere to fatalist ideas of \u201call politicians are the same\u201d. If we add to this the trivialisation of violence and judicial impunity, we would believe that nothing could be done. But this is a vision that underestimates people. \nHistory has shown, in contrast, that resistance is necessary and inevitable. The day after the 2009 coup, in spite of their suffering, the Honduran people did not sit idly by. First it created a Resistance Front against the coup government. Then it focused efforts in the struggle against corruption and continuity, especially since Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez bypassed the law to run for re-election, something that is illegal under the current Constitution. Finally, it is equally important to emphasise that these movements have understood that struggles, in order to be effective, also should bring about a change of government, even if that is not the final goal. As such, they have formed an Opposition Alliance to take on the current political opponent, and not shying away from openly describing the government of Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez as a dictatorship. \nFrom Saturday, December 3rd, to Sunday, Hondurans again protested against electoral fraud, the curfew and repression by banging pots and pans . In this context, the announcement of new results by an Electoral Court which is suspected of colluding with the government offers no prospects of exiting this deep political and institutional crisis. Only adhering to the conditions demanded by the main opposition party and putting a stop to repression will do. \nIn light of the challenges posed by Honduran events, the reactions from international bodies such as the OAS (whose president Almagro is obsessed exclusively with Venezuela) and the media have been timid or non-existent. This shows that the big powers are more than comfortable with failed states so long as they help advance their geopolitical interests. \nThe Honduran people are providing a brave lesson of hope for the oppressed peoples of the world. Let us join them in their struggle. \nNote: \n(1) The group Los Guaragaos became known by their rendition of Ali Primera\u2019s \u201cCasas de Cart\u00f3n\u201d, a song that denounces structural

2017-12-07T08:50:47Z 2017-12-07T09:12:23Z \nBy The Associated Press \nKAMPALA, Uganda (AP) - Uganda's military says it has begun withdrawing dozens of its troops from peacekeeping duty in Somalia. \nLt. Col. Deo Akiiki, deputy spokesman for the Ugandan military, said Thursday that 281 troops will leave Somalia by Dec. 31. \nAkiiki said that under an agreement between the African Union and the U.N.

We celebrate the another anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor , one of the most consequential events of the 20th century: \" On this day in 1941, at around 1:30 p.m., President Franklin Roosevelt is conferring with advisor Harry Hopkins in his study when Navy Secretary Frank Knox bursts in and announces that Japan had attacked Pearl Harbor . The attack killed more than 2,400 naval and military personnel.\" In 1970, the movie \"Tora, Tora, Tora\" was released. It is still my favorite movie about the events of that day.

Janet Wickell The Carpenter's Star quilt block pattern can be configured in several ways. A combination of diamond shapes and squares are traditionally used to assemble this popular patchwork design, but my easy version explains how to sew the block using easier methods.\nCarpenter's Star quilt blocks are sometimes known by other names -- the most common is Carpenter's Wheel. The differences in quilt block name variations are often due to the placement of color and contrast .\nCarpenter's Star ... MORE quilt blocks can be sewn in an orderly arrangement of fabrics, like mine, or with randomly chosen fabrics to create scrap quilts .\nCarpenter's Star finishes at 16\" x 16\" , a good size for wall hangings, bed quilts, or even a throw pillow cover .\nChoose Fabrics for Carpenter's Star Individual units in the quilt block finish at 2\" square, and that means large prints that look very different from one area of the fabric to another aren't (usually) as suitable as tone on tone fabrics and smaller prints. Do mix it up to add visual texture to the finished block, but keep scale in mind when you choose quilting fabrics .\nDownload a blank coloring book drawing of the quilt block if you would like to sew the quilt block with more fabrics than my example. Mark your own color choices on the drawing, but read through the pattern a few times before you begin so that you understand how to replace fabrics in different areas of the block.\nCutting for One Carpenter's Star Quilt Block Cutting instructions for this quilt block are tricky because you may use more fabrics and choose a totally different color arrangement for your own block(s).\nI've used the example above as a guide to cutting and (other than the background) am treating each area of the block as a different section to make it easier to understand.\nRefer to each pattern page for cutting instructions.\nBeginning Quilters Should Take a Look at:\nHow to Rotary Cut Strips of Fabric from Selvage to Selvage How to Cut Patchwork Shapes How to Print My Quilt Patterns Very Dark Fabric\nShown as black. Hot Dark Fabric\nShown as red. Learn the differences between warm and cool colors . Lighter Print Fabric\nShown as paisley. Light Background\nShown as an ivory print. Remember that you can turn contrast around entirely. Sew a very dark background and turn the star shapes into contrasting colors.\nAbout Half Square Triangle Units (HST) Seasoned quilters often choose to sew HSTs with the 'textbook' size of patches. I'm a seasoned quilter, but I always increase patch size when I make the units. Why? Because units made with exact sizes are sometimes too small (and can be a bit skewed). It's worth the extra time it takes me to sew the units a bit oversize and then trim them back to the exact (unfinished) size after assembly.\nI would add an extra 1/4\" or so to the dimensions given for all HST units -- a personal preference.\nHST cutting for this quilt block pattern reflects one easy way to make the patchwork. Alter cutting in any way you like as long as the units finish at 2\" x 2\" (measure 2-1/2\" x 2-1/2\" after assembly).\nIf you choose to sew with just a few fabrics try the Magic 8 Half Square Triangle method to create groups of eight identical HST units at the same time.\nContinue to 2 of 3 below. 02 of 03 Begin Making the Carpenter's Star Quilt Block Carpenter's Star Quilt Block. Janet Wickell Make the Quilt Block's Center Background Fabric\n(4) for HST units (or choose a larger size and stick with it throughout the pattern ) (4) 2-1/2\" x 2-1/2\" squares Hot Dark Fabric\n(4) for HST units (or increased size) Lighter Print Fabric (the paisley is illustrated in yellow-gold)\n(4) for HST units (or increased size) The center of the Carpenter's Star Quilt Block is a pinwheel surrounded by a ... MORE frame that has 'arms' stretching outward. Diamond shapes emerge when you sew the frame to the inner pinwheel.\nThe block's center is very much like the Sarah's Choice quilt block .\nThe quilt block could be sewn by assembling eight rows with eight units each, and then joining the rows. But long, narrow rows often stretch out of shape. You can minimize stretch by assembling the patchwork in chunks.\nIn my example, the arms surrounding the inner pinwheel are the same fabric as the darker fabrics they connect to.\nI won't repeat the instruction, but encourage everyone to improve accuracy by pressing to set seams before pressing a seam allowance to one side .\nDraw a diagonal line from one corner to the opposite corner on the reverse side of each 2-7/8\" background square and two of the lighter print squares of the same size. Pair two of the marked background squares with two hot dark fabric squares, right sides together and all edges matched. Pair the remaining two marked background squares in the same way with the two unmarked light fabric squares. Pair the remaining light squares with the hot dark squares. Use the instructions in my quick pieced unit tutorial to sew each pair together 1/4\" from each side of the marked line. Use chain piecing to speed up assembly . When complete, carefully trim back units to exactly 2-1/2\" square if you sewed with oversize patches. Test your quarter inch seam allowance before sewing the remaining patchwork. Arrange the four hot dark/light print units into two rows as shown, Figure 1. Sew the units in each row together. in adjoining rows in opposite directions. Join the rows and press. The pinwheel you just made should measure 4-1/2\" x 4-1/2\". Use straight pins to match and secure patchwork throughout the entire assembly process. Arrange the remaining HST units around the pinwheel center as shown in Figure 2. Sew the components of each row together. Press the middle (wider) row's seam allowances toward the center. Press the top and bottom seam allowances away from the center. Join the rows and press, Figure 3. The partial block should measure 8-1/2\" x 8-1/2\". Continue to 3 of 3 below. 03 of 03 Finish Sewing the Carpenter's Star Quilt Block Carpenter's Star Quilt Block Assembly. Janet Wickell Cut Remaining Fabric Background Fabric\n(12) for HST units (or size determined previously if trimming back) (12) 2-1/2\" x 2-1/2\" squares You could replace the smaller squares with (4) 2-1/2\" x 4-1/2\" rectangles and (8) 2-1/2\" x 2-1/2\" squares, but keeping all units in the block the same basic (square) shape is one way to balance the shapes for quilting. Hot Dark Fabric\n(8) (or other matching size for HSTs) Lighter ... MORE Print Fabric\n(8) (or other matching size for HSTs) Very Dark Fabric\n(4) (or other matching size for HSTs) (4) 2-1/2\" x 2-1/2\" squares Sew the Remaining Half Square Triangle Units Draw a diagonal line on the reverse side of each background square reserved for HST units (just as you did for previous units). Draw a diagonal line on the reverse side of four of the hot dark squares reserved for HST units. Use the same quick piecing technique (page 2) to pair eight HST background squares with the same number of light print fabric HST squares. When sewn and cut apart you should have (16) 2-1/2\" x 2-1/2\" background/light print HST units. Trim back if necessary. Pair four marked background HST squares with four unmarked dark hot squares to create eight HST units of the same size. Pair four marked hot dark HST squares with the same number of very dark squares to create eight HST units. Finish Assembling the Carpenter's Star Quilt Block Gather four background/light print HST units, two background/hot dark HST units, and two hot dark/very dark HST units. Arrange the units into two rows as shown at the top of Figure 4. Check angles carefully and then sew the patchwork in each row together. Press the seam allowances in the bottom row away from the center. Press the allowances in the top row towards the center. Join the two rows. Press new seam allowance towards the top row. Repeat to make three more identical sections of the quilt block. Sew one of the new sections to the top of the block and another to the bottom of the block as shown, Figure 4 right. One section must be flipped around. towards the center of the quilt block. Gather three 2-1/2\" x 2-1/2\" background squares and one 2-1/2\" very dark square of the same size. Refer to Figure 5, top left. Sew two background squares side by side to create a row (this is where a 2-1/2\" x 4-1/2\" rectangle could be substituted). Sew the remaining two squares side by side. Arrange as shown and press seam allowances in adjoining rows in opposite directions (bottom row towards very dark is best). Join the rows and press seams toward the row with the dark square. Repeat to make three more identical units. Arrange the corner units you just made with the two remaining units from Figure 4, placing them on opposite sides of the partial block as shown (one of the Figure 4 units is shown expanded, but is sewn together by now). Sew patchwork in each vertical column together. Press new seam allowances in towards the center. Join the vertical sides to the middle of the quilt, carefully matching all seam intersections. Press the quilt block. It should measure 16-1/2\" x 16-1/2\".

I expected an earful then anyway.\nGood riddance.

The Meelick House is the Perfect Ireland Holiday Rental Vacation Home. \nThat the Meelick House , an elegantly rustic stone coach rental home set on a rural patch of electric green in County Clare, came to represent such\u2026let\u2019s call it a kind of cognitive dissonance in our lives, was a fact in need of mending, a careful stitching up of our fabric torn during a tumultuous five days spent in Ireland during the summer of \u201916. It was like coming back home again. Our return to The Meelick House. \nOn this occasion, during Thanksgiving week \u201917, we ended up there again, purposefully, but this time only after having completed our explorations in, and of, Kilkenny, Killarney, Ring of Kerry, Limerick, Ennis and Galway. \nThe pacing along the way allowed for restful breathes; the three days back at Meelick, a full exhale. \nThis is what we longed for, this time together in the house, in the most perfect rental home we have ever known; time to venture outside gloved and mittened, bundled in hoodies and rain slickers, exclusively on foot and no farther than the stretch of undulating country road beyond the cream colored pillars and propped open metal gates, with its linear patch of perpetually damp grass sandwiched between the spaces where tires crunch stone, beneath a thick canopy of autumn in the Irish countryside. \nOranges against greens with puffs of cloud peeking through when the breeze happened to blow correctly, which it did repeatedly for three perfect days; the flag as nature provides it. \nI pulled our black Audi up to the pale yellow main house, beneath where ivy serpentines up walls, parking at a 15-degree angle so as to face our coach house, to set even our idle ride\u2019s focus there for the duration of a perfect Ireland holiday vacation. \nBefore the engine rumbled to a stop, the two doggies, Arthur Guinness and Bailey, one vanilla, the other a stout, were alongside and leaping, wanting licks of two girls\u2019 faces, two girls who, for the last 15 months, have been waiting to be leaped up upon and licked by a pair of rough Irish doggie tongues. \nIt\u2019s them, those two girls and those two dogs, who made our perfect decision to stay put, who gifted us a perfect Ireland holiday, who righted the wrong, who mended whole cloth to its original sheen.

the role public space plays in thriving urban areas cannot be underestimated. That\u2019s the message Wall Street Journal\u2019s 2013 design innovator of the year and Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects principal Thomas Woltz says \u2013 and he believes Auckland, our densest city, is doing an extraordinary job of it. \nOver the past twenty years, Woltz has established himself as one of the world\u2019s most important landscape architects and created an impressive body of work that spans the globe. As the principal and owner of US landscape architecture firm Nelson Byrd Woltz, his team is split between New York City and Charlottesville, Virginia. \nHowever, Woltz is a frequent visitor to Aotearoa and has worked on projects across the country for the last 16 years, including Orongo Station , the Hobsonville Coastal walkway , Eastwoodhill Arboretum in Ngatapa and now, Cornwall Park . \nOrongo Station. Nelson Byrd Woltz transformed a 3,000 acre overgrazed sheep farm into a landscaped space incorporating a series of gardens inspired by the ecology and culture of the area, a working farm and a Maori cemetery. \nHe visited Auckland recently to discuss the 100-year master plan in place for Cornwall Park. \nWoltz says the work a landscape architect does is quite distinctive from the work of an architect. \n\u201cIt\u2019s quite different in that architecture is making an object that occupies a system,\u201d he says. \u201cLandscape architecture is everything outside the building \u2013 the design of transportation, public spaces, boulevards, streets, parks.\u201d \nIt\u2019s also a profession whose work can often be underappreciated or underestimated. \nWhile a building being erected is a big, bold and obvious action that people will marvel at, the work that goes into the landscape surrounding it is often invisible to the naked eye. \nThe landscape architect looks at all of the elements that make up a public space \u2013 streets, parks, trees \u2013 as one interconnected landscape, Woltz says, even if the public does not. \n\u201cBut I think that\u2019s what makes it such an exciting profession because you can make such a big difference, particularly when you practice it the way we do it, where we try take into consideration the ecological health and cultural history of a place.\u201d \nHe says he always begins each project by listening very carefully to the land for stories of its ecology and culture. \n\u201cThat becomes the inspiration for contemporary design \u2013 not patterns or stripes or lumps or mounds. A lot of very flash contemporary landscape architecture can almost erase history or have a total disregard for history. I think history\u2019s hot,\u201d he says. \n\u201cKnowing where things came from is amazingly inspiring. I\u2019ve watched over the 20 years since the start of my career, and people feel so connected to these places when they start to learn these stories \u2013 the landscape is the thread that binds us to a place.\u201d \nAn example of this is the Houston Memorial Park, where instead of creating a memorial statue to honour dead soldiers who hailed from the area, Nelson Byrd Woltz is planting trees in memory of the fallen. In 25 years\u2019 time, the trees will be cut down and used on furniture, houses and buildings. \n\u201cWhen the trees are planted perfectly in a row, they kind of remind you of soldiers marching in formation,\u201d Woltz says. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s a powerful reminder of sacrifice. That\u2019s an example of looking at history, honouring history but not recreating it. We\u2019re not creating the camp, canvas tents or re-building buildings, we\u2019re using very contemporary planning and our imagination to honour this piece of history, but in a 21st century way.\u201d Houston Memorial Park \nBut the role that landscape architecture can play isn\u2019t just significant for its ability to tell a story. Woltz says as cities growing increasingly complex and denser, parks \u2013 and landscape design \u2013 play a crucial role in the urban fabric of a place. \nAnd as developments place more strain on cities, he says it\u2019s of the upmost importance to keep the quality of public spaces high. \n\u201cYou can rent apartments and hotels and restaurants, and all of those places people pay to be in, but the landscape is not something you pay for in the same way,\u201d he says. \u201cIt requires cities to be quite visionary in assuring that the quality of the landscapes \u2013 I\u2019m including streets, boulevards, parks, coastal walkways \u2013 is keeping up with the pace and density of development.\u201d \nHe says Auckland, New Zealand\u2019s fastest growing city, is doing an \u201cextraordinary job\u201d of treading the fine balance between public spaces and high-density developments. \n\u201cWith the coastal walkway in Hobsonville, that was a big commitment to the quality of the public realm around the perimeter of that development, which will be fully accessible to the public.\u201d \nThe Hobsonville coastal walk \nBut for Woltz, the importance of designing public spaces goes even deeper than this \u2013 it helps combat short-termism thinking and fretting about the devastation reaped by current events. \nOften, the spaces he designs are 100-year master plans, so the work he does is incredibly poignant in the way he won\u2019t live to see some projects complete. \n\u201cReally unfortunate political elections, like what\u2019s happened in the United States, they\u2019re heart wrenching and problematic, but once you\u2019ve planted a million trees and you\u2019re helping of planting another million, you see the world on a slower time frame. Or maybe a faster time frame,\u201d he says. \n\u201cYou\u2019re thinking on the scale of a century, so with the day-to-day you become extremely patient with life. I think that\u2019s been a helpful psychological tool in a very depressing era in the United States \u2013 thinking about the persistence of nature and the aspiration that our work will undo some of the damage our species has done.\u201d \nAnd for naysayers who look at a park and label it as \u2018empty\u2019, he says they couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. \n\u201cMy line I use all the time is the landscape is not empty, the landscape is full. It\u2019s full of stories, it\u2019s full of culture and ecology, so our job is to see those stories that might have gone invisible or been interrupted and help bring those back to visibility.\u201d Tagged: design , public spaces , urban , Landscape architecture , Thomas Woltz , parks \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas woltz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woltz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nelson byrd woltz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nelson byrd woltz landscape architects", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "charlottesville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orongo station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hobsonville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastwoodhill arboretum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auckland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ngatapa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston memorial park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cornwall park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:51:10.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "56481f4b80644c1ae88b3a1b89506bea514d5f89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxvxVKWlWFS4Zq3dxuh4X9h_lkCcsMEnSpB0bgKqmwWoArwMwy8U2N.zGh14k82WVJomcfS210OC9I3c_aB4EoKsRIysuURB4r91V6h1jQ_ow--", "site_full": "forum.kvinneguiden.no", "site": "kvinneguiden.no", "site_section": "http://forum.kvinneguiden.no/forum/294-telletr%C3%A5der-og-ordleker/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Telletr\u00e5der og ordleker - Kvinneguiden Forum", "title": "La oss telle til 2018 f\u00f8r 2018 55", "title_full": "La oss telle til 2018 f\u00f8r 2018 - Page 55 - Telletr\u00e5der og ordleker - Kvinneguiden Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T06:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "NO", "spam_score": 0.101, "main_image": "http://forum.kvinneguiden.no/uploads/monthly_2017_11/kg_logo.jpg.2cc246c4f2263fe4acd07583e6a83fca.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 42764, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d2e2ed97d2895b32a0fb1e4d8864df77a47d799", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxvxVKWlWFS4Zq3dxuh4X9h_lkCcsMEnSpB0bgKqmwWoArwMwy8U2N.zGh14k82WVJomcfS210OC9I3c_aB4EoKsRIysuURB4rS3ElxMCDMoLvqqeEMO.6O1wnq_7msfS.JiDcxjBTeUg--", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "AnonymBruker", "published": "2017-12-07T08:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "AnonymBruker 4286158 6637363 AnonymBruker .
