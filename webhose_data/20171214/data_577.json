This was amply proved when a project of Ms. Jaya Megane, a 12-year-old tribal girl from Shahapur taluka in Thane district, was selected for the National Children\u2019s Science Congress, to be held in Ahmedabad. And her project was also unique- soil-less farm. This is not a sole such example. There are several tribal sportspersons who have represented the country at Olympics and won medals, competing with champions coming from across the globe. This calls for making educational and other facilities available to the students living in all the corners of the country. Unfortunately, the spread of quality education has remained restricted to big cities only, depriving rural students a level playing field. Because of this, most of the rural students fail to make it big. The country has a vast pool of talent in villages. However, it remains untapped. Rural students must also be given equal opportunities to excel.\nWELCOME INCENTIVE\nTHE Union Government has done well to raise export incentives to labour-intensive industries, especially MSME and services sectors by Rs. 8450 crores. This should meet the demands and concerns of industries in these two critical sectors which contribute substantially to foreign exchange earnings. By offering enhanced incentives the Government has sought to achieve several goals. Leather, agriculture, carpets, handicrafts and marine products are labour-intensive sectors. Hence by offering larger incentives to these sectors the Government is seeking to raise job creation possibilities. Secondly it also will meet the Government\u2019s aim of promoting MSME sector because of their nature of being job-intensive. Thirdly, the Government wants to give fillip to the sagging export sector, which has shown some decline in recent quarters of the current fiscal, thereby raising concerns about the rising Current Account Deficit (CAD). And lastly the Government wants to correct the disruption caused after the introduction of GST regime.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://comments.bharatiweb.in/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jaya megane", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national children\u2019s science congress", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ahmedabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shahapur", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:16.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b7c01f196e2bc2f41bf8a7afdda169c1691ee950", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeTyRzZ7TZa7wtybNnnMYYg1FA08vuIKUZNKLCgkZZ9i0aS0Tl27SBCNlFBDdLQfy1IS38knCCJb8oglYXUQ0k43cbzDv.L2hEIXSH5jZZQJf6kw77CrR3fQ--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/hisense/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Hisense Products for the Best Price in Malaysia", "title": "32\u201d HD LED TV 32M2160P", "title_full": "Hisense 32\u201d HD LED TV 32M2160P | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-03-11T10:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 255, "participants_count": 236, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.279, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fe92372df12683a6ed95229dd69db75cef021f6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFeTyRzZ7TZa7wtybNnnMYYg1FA08vuIKUZNKLCgkZZ9i0aS0Tl27SBCNlFBDdLQfy1IS38knCCJb8oglYXUQ0k43cbzDv.L2hEIXSH5jZZQJfVOH2dKjA_ClpkkvKtaH6y", "ord_in_thread": 237, "author": "Tiew", "published": "2017-11-20T15:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "bad", "text": "use 1week, break up", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:16.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ea739cea268b28d89d8a88c978f81b6a5ec3f1de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyk7PkuqEeASEJRX2jdD1jnmx2hsIfD4tnw8opQ_UHO2sfmc6dvcKe4xt40gZ88Da3TpoDOkWVGfAYxdt056DK4UAX.r.GP4gNeLJKogdEb31QuALUbqAmNl818REMomK9.ZXL.uNLe9A--", "site_full": "personal-essay-examples-college.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://personal-essay-examples-college.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Personal Essay Examples College", "title": "'The Amazing Generosity of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Poor'", "title_full": "'The Amazing Generosity of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Poor'", "published": "2017-12-07T11:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ea739cea268b28d89d8a88c978f81b6a5ec3f1de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyk7PkuqEeASEJRX2jdD1jnmx2hsIfD4tnw8opQ_UHO2sfmc6dvcKe4xt40gZ88Da3TpoDOkWVGfAYxdt056DK4UAX.r.GP4gNeLJKogdEb31QuALUbqAmNl818REMomK9.ZXL.uNLe9A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Carson Butler (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "'The Amazing Generosity of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Poor'", "text": "' perhaps you imagined t palpebra the throng on the shadow rungs of the scotch work would be pinching any cultivation centime to energise annuls meet.

It is only necessary to hold the Command and the R key until the Apple logo appears. I cannot imagine why it would offer Yosemite it should offer the current running macOS.\nIt does sound as though your HD may be dieing so reinstalling simply may not work but it is your only chance to retrieve your data.\nThe options if this does not work are to remove the internal HD, install a new one, obtain a bootable installer in the form of a thumb drive or similar to install a fresh new macOS on your new HD then mount your old HD in an external usb enclosure and try to retrieve your old data which may or may not be possible.\nThis could all have been avoided by investing in the software and a dedicated external HD to clone your internal drive to. I strongly advise everyone to do this. My wife ran her business on a laptop running from a clone of her HD for nearly a month before we were able to replace her deceased internal HD a couple of years ago. I know this is not any comfort to you now but when you see how complex it is to recover from a failed HD without a backup or a secondary computer you can understand why we harp on backups.\nDo you by chance have another Mac computer?

That is to reinstall the existing Operating System. When you are in the restore partition you should see a central window with four options. One of those should be Reinstall Mac OS. It is only necessary to hold the Command and the R key until the Apple logo appears. I cannot imagine why it would offer Yosemite it should offer the current running macOS.\nIt does sound as though your HD may be dieing so reinstalling simply may not work but it is your only chance to retrieve your data.\nThe options if this does not work are to remove the internal HD, install a new one, obtain a bootable installer in the form of a thumb drive or similar to install a fresh new macOS on your new HD then mount your old HD in an external usb enclosure and try to retrieve your old data which may or may not be possible.\nThis could all have been avoided by investing in the software and a dedicated external HD to clone your internal drive to. I strongly advise everyone to do this. My wife ran her business on a laptop running from a clone of her HD for nearly a month before we were able to replace her deceased internal HD a couple of years ago. I know this is not any comfort to you now but when you see how complex it is to recover from a failed HD without a backup or a secondary computer you can understand why we harp on backups.\nDo you by chance have another Mac computer? If so it may be possible to access your data via Target Disk mode. You could also create a bootable macOS installer which would be very handy even if you need to replace the HD. No extra Mac, sadly. And as said, I know I needed a TM backup, but didn\u0092t. Which just goes to show. As stated, so far, recovery options haven\u0092t worked. Last thing I\u0092ll try is to erase the HD maybe, then reinstall the OS from the internet. Is that doable, or would I need a thumb drive to do it?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:17.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9139d6dd6cc82c2fed4d56fc783bd188b8132c60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqrGNRgIF_8DPwrd3_reTjCUnTN6jhLHCOXuSdNYie280c1tXEMGxGQe91WJlE8JLrx7nvSSnIJbtfgLcvRZOhq4_3Z9GR_DxBvoFUfjnA1Q--", "site_full": "healthunlocked.com", "site": "healthunlocked.com", "site_section": "https://healthunlocked.com/nhsweightloss", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "HealthUnlocked | The social network for health", "title": "HealthUnlocked | The social network for health", "title_full": "HealthUnlocked | The social network for health", "published": "2017-12-06T21:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5912, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e36f81ca03452c30531cf78a90e92fd8e5da301d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqrGNRgIF_8DPwrd3_reTjCUnTN6jhLHCOXuSdNYie280c1tXEMGxGQe91WJlE8JLrx7nvSSnIJbtfgLcvRZOhq4_3Z9GR_DyZbAu0TuPoP1_NeX_sTZoe", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "gman1961", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Little by little,you will get there.

(AP) - The president of Minnesota Public Radio told employees the decision to dismiss Garrison Keillor resulted from \"multiple allegations\" covering an extended period of time, but an attorney for the former \"The Prairie Home Companion\" host disputed that characterization and said the humorist wants MPR to \"set the record straight.\" \nMPR President Jon McTaggart held an off-the-record meeting with employees Wednesday, a week after the organization cut ties with Keillor. Reporters from Minnesota Public Radio News did not attend because the meeting was declared off-the-record, but compiled an account from employees who did attend. \nMPR News reports McTaggart said he alone made the decision to break with Keillor, who retired as \"Prairie Home\" host last year. Keillor told the Star Tribune he touched a woman's bare back as he tried to console her, and that he apologized. MPR has not given details of the allegations. \nIn response to the MPR News report, Keillor attorney Eric Nilsson issued a statement early Thursday. \n\"We are aware of allegations against Mr. Keillor by only one individual,\" Nilsson said. \"We trust that Mr. McTaggart will set the record straight in this respect to avoid any misperceptions on that point.\" \nNilsson says Keillor wants a swift resolution of the matter and \"with it expects a full restoration of his reputation.\" \n\"The Prairie Home Companion\" continues with Keillor's hand-picked successor, mandolinist Chris Thile.

The deal is, before they loaded your blades, some slightly mulched could have gone to a bagger but it isn't the same. It isn't the same as huge heavy piles and what your pto is capable to power. We've seen these where the deck does some mulching and the small towing attachment sucks it up and chips it further.

It has a Winsor 347 stroker (roughly 4 years old) with fresh oil.\nIts been off the road for a month or so as I just finished putting in a new Performance Automatic reverse manual C4 and a high stall (3500rpm) TCE torque converter. New trans cooler and obviously trans oil, coolant etc.\nWent for a test drive yesterday. First 10 minutes of the drive were great, engine and gearbox very sweet and car very quick.\nOnce warmed up I went for a very hard run to really test it out and possible I may have over-revved. I had a quick glance at my Autometer tach (to which I stupidly had not yet set a rev limit on) and think I saw about 6000-6500rpm (which should be safe?).\nNext set of lights horrible sounds coming from under car - it actually sounding like fluid bubbling and boiling to me so I limped the 2 minutes home at very low revs. When I popped the hood the drive belt (it has a gilmer drive) was completely off as the alternator bracket had come loose so I thought that was the sound. Tightened it up and this video is how it sounds.\nhttps://youtu.be/q5BHXIKc9I4\nI can't tell where the strange sound is coming from - whether it is engine or torque converter as it seems to be coming from everywhere at once. I tried listening with a screwdriver and the right hand side head is very loud compared to the left. But then you get under the car and it sounds even louder like its coming from the bottom rear of the engine or the bellhousing.\nI took off the inspection plate in the bellhousing and no loose bits of metal in there, bolts to the torque converter and flexplate all still tight. I've drained the oil and can't see any metal shards or anything.

An independent panel of judges assesses the quality of all entries and the winners are announced at the Awards Ceremony. Melexis entered the Excellence in design category with its MLX91804, the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) integrated circuit. This 3rd generation TPMS IC is 60% smaller and draws 3 times lower power (in sleep mode) than any competing solution available today. It incorporates a sophisticated microcontroller and an advanced pressure sensing element, as well as energy efficient wireless transceivers for communication with the vehicle. \nMonitoring tire pressure is now an essential part of modern vehicle design and global rollout of TPMS is increasing all the time, driven by international regulations and increasing emphasis on the safety of road users. \nThe attributes shown by the MLX91804 will facilitate the next generation of TPMS deployment in automobiles, as it needs just half the space and delivers 3 times lower sleep mode power consumption figures than competitors. This cutting-edge device will enable more compact solutions with greater functionality and improved energy efficiency, in line with vehicle manufacturers' growing expectations. \nDamien Macq, VP Business Unit Sensors commented: 'I am extremely excited by this recognition especially because the TPMS project is the result of great teamwork and innovative thinking. We are proud that through the Elektra award for Excellence in Product Design for Automotive we can demonstrate this further.'\n\nMelexis NV published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 09:36:06 UTC . \nOriginal document https://www.melexis.com/en/news/2017/07dec2017-elektra-awards-tpms-london \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/F652F2F53C8FEB94EC894A057F3B741EF7CF7653", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "damien macq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melexis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tessenderlo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "elektra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "elektra electronics industry awards", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "melexis nv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vp business unit sensors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:19.040+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1fd996223c26eeeba035e08f8dbe363ae33fee28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va75roLYWMJnqks7RGA4_7wBOh1ylmap6DmbMQPSIYHB.rX4cv3TEow7BfDxXXMuH.m4RHWrzyBw2vnWfLm9SWlp3jDocXtzER00o1EZyguSOs1g_q42Y7mmnwdLctCV8_ng--", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "How it is possible to wrap with BitcoinJ a Bitcoin Core RPC interface and drives regtest mode", "title_full": "How it is possible to wrap with BitcoinJ a Bitcoin Core RPC interface and drives regtest mode", "published": "2017-12-07T11:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1fd996223c26eeeba035e08f8dbe363ae33fee28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va75roLYWMJnqks7RGA4_7wBOh1ylmap6DmbMQPSIYHB.rX4cv3TEow7BfDxXXMuH.m4RHWrzyBw2vnWfLm9SWlp3jDocXtzER00o1EZyguSOs1g_q42Y7mmnwdLctCV8_ng--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Top", "published": "2017-12-07T11:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "How it is possible to wrap with BitcoinJ a Bitcoin Core RPC interface and drives regtest mode", "text": "Despite the fact that I have already create an address in regtest network which has Bitcoins I can not import correctly this address to my BitcoinJ app in order to execute certain functions(OP_CODE tx, send tx.. etc). \nIs this possible?

For those who got the game from bought or got the game for free from Origin or bought it in this site, there's a way to remove the 30 FPS cap. I get it this fix was spammed and gave false hope to many but I figure it out. It was the right answer but the wrong file to put it in.\nStep 1. First you find your Medal of honor Pacific Assault's Configuration folder (Users\\Documents\\EA Games\\Medal of Honor Pacific Assault)\nStep 2. Open \"newconfig.cfg\"\nStep 3. Go to file and select new\nStep 4. Add set com_maxfps 0 and save\nStep 5. Named it config.cfg At the bottom where it says \"save as type\" change that to all files so that it will make the custom cfg file. After that put it somewhere like in documents, desktop or whatever tickles your fancy.\nStep 6. That same folder where where \"newconfig.cfg\" is located add your new cfg file and load your game and enjoy\nWhile testing I found that having V-sync enable will bring back the 30 FPS cap.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:20.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "786f648eeb2f3f3b8f8729a35ad7c3f6ac4b22b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApuFHZQNJYYVa8kVRIy_ti9qMTKAaLaT70yJieaEncDimEMsqp7.QdhajLuVxUQboHYUvN1LEbhv_Q--", "site_full": "moreaboutcat.co.uk", "site": "moreaboutcat.co.uk", "site_section": "http://moreaboutcat.co.uk/feed", "site_categories": ["cats", "pets"], "section_title": "more about cat", "title": "What I\u2019ve Been Watching #16", "title_full": "What I\u2019ve Been Watching #16", "published": "2017-12-07T09:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://moreaboutcat.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/what-ive-been-watching-mini-film-reviews-final.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "786f648eeb2f3f3b8f8729a35ad7c3f6ac4b22b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApuFHZQNJYYVa8kVRIy_ti9qMTKAaLaT70yJieaEncDimEMsqp7.QdhajLuVxUQboHYUvN1LEbhv_Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cat", "published": "2017-12-07T09:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "What I\u2019ve Been Watching #16", "text": "December 7, 2017 What I\u2019ve Been Watching #16 \nWhoa, we are whizzing through the WIBW recently! So many movies! So which ones have I seen lately, huh? Battle of the Sexes \nI said at the end of my last WIBW that Battle of the Sexes was next on my list. I\u2019ve been looking forward to this movie for what feels like ages because I straight up adore Emma Stone. \nSo what did I think? It was genuinely great. The performances, particularly Emma Stone, were phenomenal. I hadn\u2019t read or watched any other depiction of Billie Jean King\u2019s story so it was all new to me and really enjoyable. It had funny moments and moments where I was v v close to a tear or two. I think given everything going on in the world to women right now, it\u2019s a really important story\u2026so go see it! \nExpectation: 3.5 Reality: 4 Murder on the Orient Express \nI\u2019ll admit that my expectation for this film was probably slightly tarred by hearing some negative vibes around it but having now seen it, I do understand why. I love a murder mystery, but having never seen any other Agatha Christie adaptations, I didn\u2019t realise just how cheesy it would be! \nThere are some nice shots in this film (I liked some of the \u2018above\u2019 perspectives that made it look a bit like a game of Cluedo!), and I may have cracked a smile once or twice but my overall feeling is that I wish the cinema had been a bit warmer so I could take a nap. \nExpectation: 2 Reality: 2 The Disaster Artist \nI knew I was going to enjoy this one. I love The Room and from the trailer I could tell that James Franco\u2019s take on Timmy Wiseau was pretty spot on. \nAlthough the funniest bits from this movie are in the trailer, I still found myself enjoying it. The performances (particularly the Franco brothers) are all great, and as well as being funny the movie is also pretty heart warming. \nOh, and stick around until after the credits\u2026 \nExpectation: 4 Reality : 4 Molly\u2019s Game \nSo I wouldn\u2019t have chosen to go see this movie, tbh. It was the Secret Screening that Cineworld put on for Unlimited card holders and I think I let out an audible sigh when the title card came up for it. It\u2019s not that I thought it would be a bad film, I just wasn\u2019t really interested in it. \nThe first half I actually thought was better than I expected, but the second half slowed the film right down and at times left me a bit bored. To go from a fast paced plot with a lot going on to the much slower \u201cpresent day\u201d parts just didn\u2019t work for me. I found myself thinking that there was nothing standout about the film at all, and it also felt about 30 mins too long. \nExpectation: 3 \nSo what\u2019s coming up next? Stronger \nJake Gyllenhaal acting his socks off? I\u2019m there. Liam managed to convince me to watch Southpaw recently and he\u2019s just SUCH a good actor.

In her new role at LGIM Real Assets, Marija will report to Rob Martin, Director of Research, and be responsible for view formation and thought leadership on infrastructure investment opportunities, as well as contributing to fund strategy and the development of new investment products. \nLGIM Real Assets has been investing in infrastructure assets since 2012. With approximately \u00a33 billion of infrastructure debt now invested, LGIM Real Assets is an active investor in all key social and economic infrastructure sectors across the UK, Europe and the US. Its largest investment to date is the \u00a3400m London Gateway Port refinancing with investment activity expected to increase further. \nThis year LGIM Real Assets has broadened its activities across the infrastructure sectors, including clean energy and transport. Key deals include: its first debt investment into the UK offshore wind sector to support the Walney extension, the world's largest offshore wind farm; first and second rail-related private debt investments, including its investments into the new fleet of south western trains and High Speed 1 (HS1), the high-speed railway connecting London to the Channel Tunnel; and first US renewables debt transaction with solar portfolio funding. \nRob Martin, Director of Research, said: 'Marija is an excellent addition to our team. This year we have made significant moves into a number of key sectors of the infrastructure market and Marija's expertise in clean energy and equity will help support our ambitions to continue to grow and expand our offering to clients. Following our first investment into UK offshore wind, we have a strong appetite for future investments across a range of sectors. We are also looking to expand into the equity side of the market and Marija's experience will prove invaluable.' \nBill Hughes, Head of LGIM Real Assets, said: 'We have made a number of senior hires this year which have allowed us to further bolster our investment capabilities in new emerging sub-sectors while also capitalising on the synergies that exist across our infrastructure, property and corporate credit businesses. The speed with which we have grown our capabilities and our ability to deploy capital into strategic assets is testament to our holistic real assets strategy and the deep cross sector expertise that we have now embedded into our business.' \nLegal & General has invested \u00a312 billion in UK infrastructure, direct investments and urban regeneration projects to date, and aims to invest \u00a315 billion. Long-term capital is a good match for investment into new assets, providing income for pension funds and stimulating UK economic growth. \nFor further information, please contact: \nOlivia Bayliss \nHead of Communications, Legal & General Capital and LGIM Real Assets \n020 3124 2777 \nFaye Walters \nPR Manager, LGIM Real Assets \n020 3124 2823 \nNotes to editors: \nLGIM Real Assets \nLGIM Real Assets is a division of Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), one of Europe's largest institutional asset managers and a major global investor.

(AP) - The Latest on Garrison's Keilor's dismissal following allegations of sexual misconduct (all times local): \n12:10 a.m. \nGarrison Keilor's attorney says the humorist is aware of only one woman making allegations of inappropriate behavior against him and wants the president of Minnesota Public Radio to \"set the record straight\" on that point. \nKeilor's personal attorney, Eric Nilsson, issued a statement early Thursday responding to a news report that MPR President Jon McTaggart told employees Wednesday the decision to cut ties with Keilor resulted from multiple allegations that covered an extended period of time. \nMPR News reported the McTaggart comments. Nilsson says that the former \"A Prairie Home Companion\" host wants a swift resolution with MPR and \"expects a full restoration of his reputation.\" \nKeillor has said he touched a woman's bare back to console her, and that he apologized. MPR has not provided details of the allegations. \n___ \n8 p.m. \nThe president of Minnesota Public Radio has told employees the decision to cut business ties with former \"A Prairie Home Companion\" host Garrison Keillor resulted from \"multiple allegations\" that covered an extended period of time. \nJon McTaggart held an off-the-record meeting with employees Wednesday, a week after Keillor's dismissal was announced. Reporters from Minnesota Public Radio News did not attend because the meeting was declared off-the-record, but compiled an account from employees who did attend. \nMPR News reports McTaggart said he alone made the decision to break with Keillor, who retired as \"Prairie Home\" host last year. Keillor told the Star Tribune he touched a woman's bare back as he tried to console her, and that he apologized. \nThe show continues with Keillor's hand-picked successor, mandolinist Chris Thile.
