I am a sunny morning kind of person. If dawn hasn\u2019t cracked and the sun hasn\u2019t risen, then neither should I, especially if it\u2019s cold outside. And let\u2019s face it; where I live, it\u2019s dark and cold for a good number of months. \u00a92014 JFries \nThe exception to my usual disposition is the month of December. December is special in this regard and I actually look forward to waking up in the dark. Yes, I said it, \u201cI look forward to it.\u201d I pull on warm fuzzy clothes to ward off the early morning chill, tip toe down the darkened hallway and stairs, flip a couple of switches and am greeted with the soft coloured lights welcoming me on the staircase where the stockings are all hung with care waiting for the Christmas Eve magic that never grows old. I step into the parlour which is bathed in warm colours from the glowing Christmas tree, it\u2019s branches spreading protectively over the gaily coloured packages carefully wrapped and placed there over the last few days. \nThe stillness of the house is still intact as I make my way to the living room where the villagers are just starting to wake up. The early risers are already at the bakery choosing their delicacies for their own celebrations. \nOn a regular day I would throw on all the lights I could to drive the darkness away, but instead, in December I shuffle my way to the kitchen and make a cup of tea. Deeply I inhale the rich aroma of bergamot and settle myself in a cozy chair with a view to the East. This morning I\u2019m in no rush for the sun to chase away the darkness. Instead I am ready to welcome it with patience and wonder, amongst the softly glowing lights that twinkle here and there, much like the last stars slowly blinking their good night as they take their turn to rest. I marvel at the beauty as the sun paints the sky with brilliant pinks, reds, and purples, welcoming the new day with all the beauty and all the magic it holds, just waiting for me to discover all it has to offer. \nAnd now, the adventure begins. \nIt\u2019s All Good, it really is just how you choose to look at things. \n\u00a92014/2017 Rise Like Air J.

I am so proud to know Corey and if you think \u201ceveryone is a little OCD\u201d she will kindly begin your education on the subject. \nObsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health disorder that affects people of all ages and walks of life, and occurs when a person gets caught in a cycle of obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted, intrusive thoughts, images or urges that trigger intensely distressing feelings. Compulsions are behaviors an individual engages in to attempt to get rid of the obsessions and/or decrease his or her distress. \nMost people have obsessive thoughts and/or compulsive behaviors at some point in their lives, but that does not mean that we all have \u201csome OCD.\u201d In order for a diagnosis of obsessive compulsive disorder to be made, this cycle of obsessions and compulsions becomes so extreme that it consumes a lot of time and gets in the way of important activities that the person values. \u2013 International OCD Foundation image courtesy of The Mighty \nIn the essay, OCD and Me, Corey describes life with OCD as her constant companion. A mental illness\u2019 strong grasp unfortunately can easily grab hold of someone and never let go. Living in their head every waking moment for the rest of their life. The world of mental illness is a dark and scary place that many people have to experience. Unluckily for me, I drew the short end of the stick and have had to live every second of my life since I was in the fifth grade battling against my own brain with the constant voice of obsessive compulsive disorder. For me, always having an outrageous fear in my head and wanting to hide away from the world have become major aspects of my life and are my version of normal. These voices control every thought, feeling and movement that I have, slowly destroying the world around me that took so long to create. OCD has shown me the struggles that everyone can go through and the different battles we all are fighting. At the age of eleven I was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder. At that time I knew very little about it, but I soon came to learn about the extreme stigma and stereotypes around it. The people around me most often would say things to me such as \u201cjust stop\u201d or \u201cwe all have a little bit of OCD,\u201d however it seemed that no matter how hard I tried I could not just stop the OCD in my head. This realization was what truly made me understand that not everyone had OCD and that not everyone was the same. OCD deals with severe obsessions and compulsions that often are referred to as rituals. My rituals often consist of counting things, not being able to write with one hand, having to jump over cracks and click my heels together and much more. One of my most harmful rituals involves looking at the sun or lights depending on where I am. Although I know the danger that many of my rituals put me in, I can not stop doing them. There is a constant fear in my head that if I stop doing them, something even worse will happen. I know that this is silly but the thing with OCD is that, even if you know that your rituals cannot change certain events in life, the voice that is trapped inside your head screaming at you, refuses to leave. As of now, I don\u2019t often realize that I\u2019m doing a ritual and it just seems like everyday life. In the past six years since being diagnosed, I have taken over six thousand pills to help manage my symptoms. However, even if the medication helps with my rituals they often bring other side effects as well. I\u2019ve had to go to the hospital several times due to medication problems, and they have worsened some of my other mental conditions. In the past years OCD has changed me a lot. It has taught me to keep my head down and to be quiet, and to avoid certain situations, people and places whenever I can. However, OCD has also taught m that we all have our own struggles, and that mine are just located directly behind my eyes. \u00a92017 Corey \nTo learn more about Obsessive Compulsive Disorder from everyday people living and succeeding with OCD every day. \n\n\n\nToday and everyday, we celebrate everyday people, just like Corey, living their lives, following their paths and facing their challenges as they grow into the amazing awesome people they are. \nWith love, support and determination, we are able to choreograph each step and stumble into our own beautiful and graceful unique dance. \n\u00a92017 J Fries/Rise Like Air Advertisements", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "corey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:50.049+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c0314632bf7d43aa7e86a35813682507f6a60711", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTePsLKr1IdirL4ItU7uobNcww_FO_MWp_2WQjJnuZ1Ykno_f8uVHfXvH3aIiH58x8FCfmcsqRGNSlZl6LsiLG3B4jCaGDzex8-", "site_full": "ldsmag.com", "site": "ldsmag.com", "site_section": "https://ldsmag.com/feed", "site_categories": ["religion", "latter_day_saints"], "section_title": "Meridian Magazine", "title": "Church Donates $5 Million in Ongoing Refugee Assistance", "title_full": "Church Donates $5 Million in Ongoing Refugee Assistance", "published": "2017-12-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ldsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Crop01.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86709, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c0314632bf7d43aa7e86a35813682507f6a60711", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTePsLKr1IdirL4ItU7uobNcww_FO_MWp_2WQjJnuZ1Ykno_f8uVHfXvH3aIiH58x8FCfmcsqRGNSlZl6LsiLG3B4jCaGDzex8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The LDS Newsroom", "published": "2017-12-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Church Donates $5 Million in Ongoing Refugee Assistance", "text": "By The LDS Newsroom \u00b7 December 6, 2017 \nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints recently announced its ongoing commitment to help alleviate the global refugee crisis.

If passed, the ban would take effect as soon as it is signed by Gov. Jay Inslee. \nThe proposal is not the first legislative attack on the farming of the non-native species here. After the collapse of a net pen off Cyprus Island in August, and the resulting release of about 160,000 Atlantic salmon, Sen. Kevin Ranker, D-Orcas Island, proposed phasing out the practice as leases with the state Department of Natural Resources expire, which could extend through 2025. \nThe proposal from Republican Reps. Jim Walsh, of Aberdeen, and Drew MacEwen, who represents the 35th district that includes Hood Canal, is more extreme. MacEwen says there\u2019s too much at stake to put it off any longer. \n\u201cWe spend millions of dollars and a lot of other resources in this state to protect our native species, which are endangered. And our runs are down. We need to ensure the survival of our native species,\u201d MacEwen said. \n\u201cIt makes no sense to introduce a non-native species that will directly compete with the native salmon, when here we are spending the amount of money we are trying to enhance native runs,\u201d he said. \nThe proposal would still allow net pen farming of native fin fish species and has support from the Squaxin Island Tribe, which operates a net pen complex in South Puget Sound, for farm-raised native coho. \nCooke Aquaculture owns the net that collapsed along with 7 others in Washington waters, all of which would be banned under this proposal. \nThe company says there is no scientific proof that their escaped Atlantic salmon feed in the wild or pose other competitive risks to native fish. \nThe State Department of Fish and Wildlife confirms that samples collected of the escaped Atlantics after the spill came in with empty stomachs. They were also disease free and sexually immature. \nCooke Vice President of Communications Nell Halse says the company doesn't agree with lawmakers who say that their salmon farms pose a big risk. It's an industry that depends on a healthy ocean environment, she says \nCooke also shares an interest in saving wild salmon and has invested in major projects to help restore them in other jurisdictions. \n\u201cAnd really, we need to focus on, what are the initiatives that are going to really restore wild salmon stocks.

Watson is only one piece of the complicated legal puzzle over the long-term fate of the president's efforts to limit travel to the U.S. By Arnie Seipel \u2022 Sep 25, 2017 \nThe Trump administration is updating its travel ban, just hours before it was set to expire. In a proclamation signed by President Trump on Sunday, the travel restrictions now include eight countries, a couple of which are not majority-Muslim, as had been the case with all the nations in the original ban. By Nina Totenberg \u2022 Sep 8, 2017 \nA federal appeals court ruled Thursday evening that the Trump administration can't ban grandparents and other family members of citizens and legal residents from coming to the U.S. from six mainly Muslim countries. \nThe Justice Department downplayed the ruling, looking ahead to a higher-ranking court considering the case: \"The Supreme Court has stepped in to correct these lower courts before, and we will now return to the Supreme Court to vindicate the Executive Branch's duty to protect the Nation.\" \u00a9 2017 KNKX", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "camila domonoske", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derrick k. watson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nina totenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arnie seipel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "executive branch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:52.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a9abab3d225fcc734158033eccc32d9d7a54c7c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Zq15apL97Q3LuxW3N94zD6rTiWQhBTjlxuT.jZve81pOXjuMmdO6pb4ihtgWyVmmne90QEBTa5hMsZF2w4R2BSwEw4yE6kLp4lHNwm_zA6Q--", "site_full": "www.blogbombillas.com", "site": "blogbombillas.com", "site_section": "http://www.blogbombillas.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bombillas de bajo consumo \u591aahorro o timo?", "title": "Tubo led Ledbox T8 integrado doble 18W 1440 lm 4000K", "title_full": "Tubo led Ledbox T8 integrado doble 18W 1440 lm 4000K", "published": "2017-12-02T12:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "830d681d7655d0aea3fb014ca27f27207bc458a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Zq15apL97Q3LuxW3N94zD6rTiWQhBTjlxuT.jZve81pOXjuMmdO6pb4ihtgWyVmmne90QEBTa5hMsZF2w4R2BSwEw4yE6kLplQimVaoIJng--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-06T02:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hola Quimete74,parece que tambi\u00e9n a nivel de tubos,la iluminaci\u00f3n LED avanza bastante y ya solo faltan ver los tubos redondos.\nHe estado en el Hipercor del Corte Ingl\u00e9s y he visto bombillas Philips grandes e27 de 18,5 W de potencia y 2000 lumens a nivel de iluminaci\u00f3n...Eso tiene que iluminar a lo bestia y luego \"su hermano menor\" de 16W y 1521 lumens de luminosidad...Sorprendente tambi\u00e9n fue ver que dicha marca vende bombillas tipo vela LED e14 con luminarias de 7w de potencia y 806 lumens de luminosidad...Asombrado me he quedado al verlo", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:52.049+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc2e41846aae9a38153a19e004894e82a3720dea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vHoTSXOqj1EHxjQbChDwotibDSmI2ze8rCdsiE559SWgYn6vWdV6sLV.POjMTQ1_qAvXh25AA8x.0u1JiiwsQFwI0ObjDgp7KgbC6TL_EEqVXMuG6L_2ONnIGxkKk35I.LSX5qhUEiEX56djRZgCYTGXHKGKavN8-", "site_full": "www.motorsport-total.com", "site": "motorsport-total.com", "site_section": "http://www.motorsport-total.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["auto_racing", "sports"], "section_title": "Motorsport-Total.com", "title": "Rallye -

Dakar 2018: Toyota geht mit v\u00f6llig neuem Hilux an den Start", "text": "von Dieter Rencken & Zoom \u00a9 \n(Motorsport-Total.com) - Seit zwei Jahren dominiert Peugeot bei der Rallye Dakar mit dem Buggy-Konzept. Nun r\u00fcstet die Konkurrenz nach. X-raid Mini wird 2018 ebenfalls auf einen komplett neu entwickelten Buggy setzen. Und auch Toyota experimentierte schon im vergangenen Jahr mit einem Fahrzeug nach diesem Konzept. 2018 wird Toyota zwar mit einem neuen Hilux antreten, dieser wird aber kein Buggy sein, sondern weiterhin ein Allradler mit Benzin-Saugmotor. \nTrotzdem wurde der Hilux, der in S\u00fcdafrika entwickelt und aufgebaut wird, komplett neu entwickelt. \"Wir haben im Grunde von null angefangen\", gibt Hallspeed-Chef Glyn Hall im Gespr\u00e4ch mit 'Motorsport-Total.com' Auskunft. \"Wir haben die gesamte Konstruktion des Autos ver\u00e4ndert, um die Regeln maximal auszunutzen. Wir haben den Motor weiter in der Mitte des Autos platziert und die Geometrie des Autos entscheidend ver\u00e4ndert. \nDer Toyota V8-Motor wurde nun direkt hinter den Vorderreifen platziert und sitzt etwas unter dem Fahrerhaus. Hinten wurde die Einzelradaufh\u00e4ngung beibehalten, obwohl die Aufh\u00e4ngungsgeometrie durch das neue Fahrzeug-Layout neu konstruiert werden musste. Laut FIA Reglement, mit dem die Unterschiede zwischen den Turbodieseln von Peugeot und Mini und den Saugbenzinern minimiert werden sollen, ist ein Luftmengenbegrenzer von 38 Millimetern erlaubt. Toyota rechnet sich Chancen mit V8 Saugmotor aus \n\"Die FIA arbeitet hat daran, die Performance der Turbodiesel und der Saugmotor-V8 auszugleichen\", so Hall. \"Das ist ein fortlaufender Prozess. Niemand wird damit komplett gl\u00fccklich sein, aber wir sind zuversichtlich, dass uns die \u00c4nderungen eine bessere Chance geben werden.\" Ein Balanceakt ist es trotzdem, wie Hall erkl\u00e4rt: \"Bei den Saugmotoren \u00e4ndert sich der Luftmengenbegrenzer w\u00e4hrend des Rennens, je nachdem in welcher H\u00f6he man f\u00e4hrt. Damit sind wir nicht ganz gl\u00fccklich. In diesem Jahr findet die Rallye knapp \u00fcber 2.000 Metern statt, womit wir den gr\u00f6\u00dften Begrenzer mit 38 Millimetern erhalten.\" \nSchon im Vorjahr wurde der Luftmengenbegrenzer f\u00fcr Saugbenziner auf 28 Millimeter vergr\u00f6\u00dfert. \"Das ist f\u00fcr uns die beste Situation und hat uns in die Karten gespielt\", glaubt Hall an Chancengleichheit. \"Der Turbodiesel ist immer auf 38 Millimeter festgelegt. Wir sollten also auf einer Augenh\u00f6he mit den Turbodieseln sein.\" Durch die neue Positionierung des Motors in der Mitte musste Hallspeed extrem viel umbauen und neu entwickeln. Gr\u00f6\u00dferer Federweg ein wichtiges Plus \nSo musste der komplette Antriebsstrang \u00fcberarbeitet werden, \"damit die Balance des Autos \u00fcber die gesamte Etappe besser wird\", sagt Hall weiter. \"Manchmal m\u00fcssen wir 450 Liter Benzin tanken, das kann eine Menge ausmachen.\" Deswegen spielt die Gewichtsverteilung eine immens wichtige Rolle. \"Mit zwei Mann Besatzung und 150 Litern Benzin an Bord exakt 50:50.\" Mit vollem Tank verlagert sich der Schwerpunkt nach hinten. \"Aber nur ein wenig. Wir haben das Auto so konstruiert, dass sich die Balance m\u00f6glichst wenig verschiebt.\" \nF\u00fcr das Handling ist ein weiterer wesentlicher Punkt der gr\u00f6\u00dfere Federweg. Im Vergleich zum Vorjahr ist der Federweg um zw\u00f6lf Prozent gr\u00f6\u00dfer. Auch das soll die konzeptionellen Nachteile zum Buggy ausgleichen. \"Wir haben mehr als 3.000 Testkilometer mit dem Hilux zur\u00fcckgelegt\", berichtet Fahrer Giniel de Villiers, der den Gro\u00dfteil der Testarbeit erledigt hat. \"Das Auto f\u00fchlt sich schnell und gut ausbalanciert an. Ich freue mich damit auf die Dakar 2018.\" spoods.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dieter rencken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jahren", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "luftmengenbegrenzer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ein balanceakt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mann besatzung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "konkurrenz nach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litern benzin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glyn hall im gespr\u00e4ch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gr\u00f6\u00dferer federweg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "durch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "begrenzer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chancen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fahrer giniel de villiers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rolle", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rallye", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "peugeot", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fia reglement", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toyota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "positionierung des motors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dakar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s\u00fcdafrika", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:52.053+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "20b966fe228a6417607cb1278974483a65aa5900", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdhdtyEekhwK.4.bckVevBX0EHrybsPT9aDT.zAr5xzPDGzWe8wCgbUchstuCGcJXsLvD_GOmb1h8CwUnSf7YG4AFAYzaNXMI-", "site_full": "hudsonvalley.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://hudsonvalley.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist hudson valley | for sale search", "title": "Contents of Home (Poughkeepsie)", "title_full": "Contents of Home (Poughkeepsie)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "20b966fe228a6417607cb1278974483a65aa5900", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdhdtyEekhwK.4.bckVevBX0EHrybsPT9aDT.zAr5xzPDGzWe8wCgbUchstuCGcJXsLvD_GOmb1h8CwUnSf7YG4AFAYzaNXMI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "Contents of Home (Poughkeepsie)", "text": "QR Code Link to This Post Contents of Home: furniture, appliances, clothes, accessories, artwork - too much to list!

Joseph, knowing from personal experience that manuscripts could sometimes get lost, had Oliver Cowdery and two other scribes make a copy of the original manuscript from which the book could be printed. [1] Because much of the original manuscript was damaged or lost, this copy of the original text, known as the printer\u2019s manuscript, is a priceless source of information on the Book of Mormon. We are fortunate that all but one line of it survives to the present day, [2] especially because it was almost destroyed in 1878. David Whitmer, original \nIn June of 1878, a tornado tore through the town of Richmond, Missouri. It destroyed a third of the city, taking away even the foundations of the buildings. [3] The county courthouse was destroyed, literally scattering books to the winds. Some of these books were carried forty miles away from the courthouse by the tornado. [4] David Whitmer, one of the witnesses to the Book of Mormon, was living in the town at the time, and had the printer\u2019s manuscript of the Book of Mormon stored in a room of his house. \nDavid\u2019s house was a large two-story, seven-room house, and the tornado turned most of it into matchsticks. Or rather, the house across the street destroyed David\u2019s house, when the tornado literally picked up his neighbor\u2019s house and threw it into David\u2019s. [5] There was only one part of David\u2019s home that was preserved: the small room in which he stored the printer\u2019s manuscript of the Book of Mormon. The rest of the house was utterly destroyed, but this room was left completely undisturbed; not even the windows were broken. [6] Everything else in that part of the town was flattened, yet the room containing the printer\u2019s manuscript survived. David and his family always attributed the preservation of the manuscript to divine intervention. [7] \nDavid Whitmer kept the manuscript until his death in 1888, and in 1903 Whitmer\u2019s grandson sold it to the Community of Christ. They, in turn, sold it to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on September 18, 2017. [8] \nThe Why \nIt is impossible to say whether the Lord intentionally preserved the printer\u2019s manuscript of the Book of Mormon, or whether the tornado and its debris simply happened to miss that room in the house by chance. However, the manuscript\u2019s brush with certain destruction reminds us all of the importance of the printer\u2019s manuscript. That precious manuscript gets readers as close as possible, in most sections of the Book of Mormon, to the very words spoken by Joseph Smith as he brought forth the text of the Book of Mormon by the gift and power of God. [9] \nIn the vast majority of cases, the current text of the Book of Mormon is substantially the same as it was when it came forth in 1830. But edits and changes have been made, usually for well-intentioned reasons. By examining the surviving sections of the original manuscript and the printer\u2019s manuscript, we can come to understand the Book of Mormon better. [10] \nMost readers of the Book of Mormon are not concerned with the small textual differences between the printer\u2019s manuscript and the modern Book of Mormon. However, examining these differences can help readers to understand many phrases or sentences in the Book of Mormon on a more technical and often interesting level. [11] For example, the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon said \u201cmediation\u201d instead of \u201cmediator\u201d, in 2 Nephi 2:27, but this was a typographical error as the printer\u2019s manuscript clearly has \u201cmediator.\u201d This error was corrected in the 1981 edition of the Book of Mormon using the invaluable Printer\u2019s Manuscript. [12] Work like this allows us all to have greater confidence in the text of the Book of Mormon. \nLooking at the handwriting of Oliver Cowdery and the other scribes is a reminder of the effort that was involved in copying page after page of the Book of Mormon. [13] It increases our appreciation for the great men and women who were involved in producing the text we all enjoy today. [14] And if God did indeed save this text from a tornado, as David Whitmer believed, it might be a good thing for us to pay a little bit more attention to the textual variants in the Book of Mormon. \nThe more we study the scriptures, and the greater attention we pay to the details of the text, the more the text will come alive to us, and the more we will see things we never noticed before. The printer\u2019s manuscript, as one of the earliest surviving text of the Book of Mormon, allows us to experience the book in a new way. If we assume that David Whitmer was right and that God had a hand in preserving this manuscript, this story is a reminder to all of us that God sometimes mercifully reaches down to intervene in our lives, helping us in miraculous ways.

Over forty years later, Lewis Bidamon, Emma Smith\u2019s second husband, opened the cornerstone and found that water seepage had destroyed most of [it].

All but one of the authentic pages and fragments of [the original manuscript] are housed in the archives of the LDS Historical Department; one-half of a sheet (from 1 Nephi 14) is owned by the University of Utah.\u201d Royal Skousen, \u201cManuscripts of the Book of Mormon,\u201d in To All the World: The Book of Mormon Articles from the Encyclopedia of Mormonism , ed.

Breakthrough glass scratch removal service used to polish glass for an \u2018as new\u2019 finish at contemporary home in Longueville, Sydney Universal Magazines The custom glazing featured in this stunning contemporary home was professionally restored onsite in Longueville, Sydney, saving the home owner the costly expense of replacing the glass due to multiple scratches over the distinctive windows \nWhether restoring or protecting glass from deterioration, EnduroShield offers the perfect solution. For restoring glass, the EnduroShield restoration service has been developed to restore all types of glass with staining or scratches back to a near new finish. \nIn this impressive coastal home in Longueville, both internal and external glass panels were restored. Replacing scratched glass once installed can be a very expensive and sometimes impractical solution. A much more affordable and sensible fix is to remove the scratches in-situ by calling on the EnduroShield glass scratch removal service. \nFurthermore, the external glass of seaside homes are exposed to harsh conditions which can permanently stain the glass over time. The EnduroShield restoration service not only removes scratches but also restores glass that is permanently stained. \nCommon areas where staining is found include: exterior windows, especially near the ocean where glass has corroded from being exposed to the salt air glass pool fencing and railings stained from salt water, chlorine or other chemicals existing shower screens stained over time from soap scum build-up or chemical damage \nProtecting interior and exterior glass with the EnduroShield easy clean treatment reduces cleaning time and minimises maintenance costs. \nThe EnduroShield easy clean coating is a must have for any contemporary home. The coating is also eco-friendly as it reduces the amount of water used and totally eliminates the need to use toxic cleaning chemicals that drain into waterways. \nKeeping glass looking new is easy with EnduroShield.

But doctors and women have hoped that the newer generations of low-dose contraceptive pills, IUDs and implants eliminated the breast cancer risk of earlier, higher-dose formulations. \nNow a big study from Denmark suggests the elevated risk of getting breast cancer \u2014 while still very small for women in their teens, 20s and 30s \u2013 holds true for these low-dose methods, too. \nIn the research published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine , a team of scientists studied 1.8 million women between the ages of 15 and 49. They were looking to see what happened over a stretch of nearly 11 years among women who used hormonal birth control \u2014 usually a combination of estrogen and progestin \u2014 versus women who relied on non-hormonal contraceptive methods, such as a condom, diaphragm or copper IUD. \nUnlike most previous research, this study didn't just track the effect of birth control pills. Because their set of data was very large, scientists this time were also able to get a good sense of the impact of various other hormonal methods \u2014 including the birth control patch, the ring, and implants as well as hormone-releasing IUDs. \nThe results showed it didn't much matter what sort of hormonal method was used, says Lina Morch , a research epidemiologist at the University of Copenhagen, who led the study. \nOverall, Morch says, she and her colleagues found \"a roughly 20 percent increased risk [of breast cancer] among women who currently use some type of hormonal contraception.\" And the longer the women used hormonal methods, she says, the higher their risk. \nThat may sound scary. But Morch and other doctors say it's important to consider how that additional risk translates in terms of actual cases of breast cancer. The illness is fairly rare among women in the age group studied. \n\"A 20 percent increase of a very small number is still a very small number,\" says Mia Gaudet , an epidemiologist with the American Cancer Society. The risk contributed by hormonal contraception, she says, is similar to the extra breast cancer risk contributed by physical inactivity, excessive weight gain in adulthood, or drinking an average of one or more alcoholic drinks per day. \n\"The absolute increase in risk [found in the study] is 13 per 100,000 women overall, but only 2 per 100,000 women younger than 35 years of age,\" writes epidemiologist David Hunter , of the University of Oxford, in an editorial accompanying the study in NEJM . \n\"Most of the cases that occurred in this analysis occurred among women who were using oral contraceptives in their 40s,\" Hunter adds. \nAny additional risk of breast cancer, he says, should be weighed against the clear benefits of hormonal contraception \u2014 benefits that go beyond the obvious advantages of preventing unwanted pregnancy. \n\"There's very good evidence,\" Hunter says, \"that oral contraceptives reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. They reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. And there's a strong suggestion they also reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. So, many calculations suggest that the use of oral contraceptives actually prevents more cancers than it causes.\" \nThe search for new hormonal contraceptives \u2014 methods that don't elevate breast cancer risk at all \u2014 should continue, Hunter says. \nMeanwhile, a conversation with your doctor can help you figure out which contraceptive method makes most sense for you.

The study's published in The New England Journal of Medicine, and NPR's Patti Neighmond has our report. \nPATTI NEIGHMOND, BYLINE: Scientists have long known contraceptives that contain estrogen can increase the risk of breast cancer. But researchers in Denmark looked at 1.8 million women between the ages of 15 and 49 to see if new lower-dosed formulations are still risky. They compared what happened over nearly 11 years among women taking hormonal birth control and women using other methods. Epidemiologist Lina Morch headed the study. \nLINA MORCH: We found approximately a 20 percent increased risk among women who currently use some type of hormonal contraception. \nNEIGHMOND: Hormonal contraception releases estrogen, progestin or a combination of both to suppress ovulation and prevent pregnancy. Mia Gaudet with the American Cancer Society says the findings are compelling because researchers didn't just look at the birth control pill. They looked at all birth control methods that release hormones. \nMIA GAUDET: Including the patch, the ring, the implant, as well as IUD. \nNEIGHMOND: All of these forms of hormonal contraception increased breast cancer risk by 20 percent. And the longer women used this type of birth control, the more breast cancer risk increased. The findings are disappointing, says epidemiologist David Hunter with the University of Oxford. Over the past few decades, researchers tried to develop new hormonal formulas using less estrogen, which is known to promote breast cancer. The hope was the lower dose would decrease breast cancer risk. But that's not what this study found. \nDAVID HUNTER: Unfortunately, the increase of 20 percent appears to apply to the most recent formulations just like it did in the '70s, '80s and '90s. So this tells us that things haven't changed. \nNEIGHMOND: Lead researcher Morch says the findings should serve as a caution but not an alarm. A 20 percent increase translates into only one extra breast cancer case for nearly every 8,000 women. It's even lower among younger women since breast cancer in this age group is relatively rare. \nMORCH: So it has to be balanced - the pros and cons of these contraceptives. And if it's not needed to take hormonal contraceptions, it might be worth considering using other methods like the copper IUD or barium if it's - like condoms, for instance. \nNEIGHMOND: Now, it's important to note in the study, women over 40 were more likely to suffer breast cancer than younger women in their 20s and 30s. Age, family history and weight gain later in life all contribute to breast cancer risk. Morch suggests women over 40 discuss possible alternatives with their doctor. And epidemiologist Hunter says there are other clear benefits of hormonal contraception. \nHUNTER: There's very good evidence that oral contraceptives reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. They reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. There's a strong suggestion they actually reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. And so many calculations suggest that use of all contraceptives actually prevents more cancers than it causes. \nNEIGHMOND: Hunter says the search for new hormonal contraceptives that don't elevate breast cancer risk should continue.

France also has a contingent of soldiers at the base, which is crucial to the ongoing fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria and to the war in Afghanistan. \nMacron smiled and shook hands with the French and American soldiers who greeted him at the base before walking into a meeting with the base's top commanders. \nSpeaking to coalition soldiers, he said the next few months of battle will determine the outcome of the war against the IS group in Iraq and Syria. \n\"This military win does not signify the end of the operations and the end of our battle because first we need to stabilize and win peace in Iraq and Syria,\" he told troops. \"Next spring is decisive in the situation in Iraq.\" \nMacron also stressed in his remarks at the air base that France wants to avoid partition in Syria and \"avoid the domination of certain international elements whose interests contradict peace.\" \nThe French president later will hold talks with Qatar's ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. \nMacron is traveling with Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who in 2015 as defense minister helped negotiate a multibillion dollar deal with Qatar to buy 24 Rafale fighter jets. Qatar may announce during Macron's visit that it will purchase up to 12 more of the French-made Dassault Rafale jets. \nMacron's visit comes just days after a Gulf Cooperation Council meeting in Kuwait failed to bring the standoff any closer to a resolution in the dispute engulfing Qatar. In June, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut relations with Qatar over allegations it supports extremists and has too-close relations with Iran. \nQatar has long denied supporting extremists and shares a massive offshore natural gas field with Tehran. \nAlso likely to come up during Macron's visit is President Donald Trump 's announcement that the U.S. recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim the city's eastern sector, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of a future independent state. \nBefore Macron's arrival, Qatar's ruler held calls with Trump, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Jordan's King Abdullah II and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Qatar has, in the past, provided crucial aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, which is run by the militant Hamas group, and has helped pay public sector wages in the besieged Palestinian territory. \n(AP)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emmanuel macron", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "macron", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheikh tamim bin hamad al thani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean-yves le drian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdullah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hamas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dassault", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central command", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf cooperation council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "doha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united arab emirates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bahrain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuwait", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:54.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a840cb5718adea7f28c3faf7e4281524d96199eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.VaHZQXXpGgoo_EXwbF96zWHWIi_fvL20rbnOhUhz5Tv4WiLC7OLCdgfjJOc8dIKyJgb2C9jiEuGmjSoEiDBekaDJFR4YrDAbA-", "site_full": "knkx.org", "site": "knkx.org", "site_section": "http://knkx.org/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["music", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "KNKX Public Radio", "title": "MPR News Reports Democratic Sen.

Al Franken Will Resign", "text": "Originally published on December 6, 2017 4:56 pm Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. \nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: \nSome breaking news from Minnesota tonight. Minnesota Public Radio News reports that Senator Al Franken will announce his resignation from the Senate tomorrow. His decision comes after at least 30 Senate Democrats, including leader Chuck Schumer, today called on Franken to step down. Joining us now from the Capitol is NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis. Hey there. \nSUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey there. \nKELLY: So these allegations of sexual harassment against Franken have been out there for weeks. What changed today that prompted this avalanche of Democrats to call for him to step aside? \nDAVIS: Politico reported this morning about a seventh accuser. It was an anonymous woman, but she alleged that in 2006 then Al Franken, who was a comedian, not yet a senator, had - again - forcibly tried to kiss her. This is what a group of female senators, including New York Democrat Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, said for them was the tipping point. This morning, in a very rapid succession, about a half a dozen female Democratic senators put out statements calling for him to resign. And they sort of started an avalanche. From that point throughout the day, Democrats in the Senate, one after another, just started calling for Franken to resign. \nI spoke to several Democratic aides who had said that this was a conversation that had been happening quietly inside the Democratic caucus for several days now but that it was just determined that it was time for him to go. I do want to add one note of caution - that the senator's office tweeted out that his final decision had not been made. He will make an announcement tomorrow. But Democrats here in the Capitol tonight certainly expect that that announcement will be his resignation. \nKELLY: Now, this, of course, comes just a day after Michigan Democratic Congressman John Conyers resigned over sexual harassment allegations. Is this starting to add up to a message that Democrats are sending? \nDAVIS: You know, we have to also talk about that this is happening, one, in this broader context of this national conversation, and then within politics, it's also happening as the Alabama Senate races is playing out. \nKELLY: Sure. \nDAVIS: And I think Democrats, particularly following President Trump's decision to re-back Roy Moore and for the Republican National Committee to get back into that race even though Moore is facing similar allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault, Democrats want to draw contrasts. Party leaders like Nancy Pelosi are saying that they want to be a party of zero tolerance towards this kind of behavior. And I would note that it might not be over. There are two additional sitting congressmen in the House - a Republican from Texas, Blake Farenthold, and a Democrat from Nevada, Ruben Kihuen - who are facing allegations of sexual harassment, and they are also facing some calls to step aside. \nKELLY: Well, other than calling for lawmakers to step aside, what else is Congress doing in response to all of these allegations? Is there some sort of legislative action, some bill brewing? \nDAVIS: It's actually been quite a lot. Already both chambers in the House and the Senate have passed new rules to mandate sexual harassment training for everyone that works here, including lawmakers, once a year. They also have competing legislation that would affect both internally how sexual harassment is handled inside the Capitol. And today, Gillibrand introduced a bipartisan bill that would essentially end forced arbitration in private companies when - they say as many as 60 million Americans, when you sign up to work for a company, part of your terms of employment or that if you have a sexual harassment complaint, it has to go through a mandatory private arbitration process. They want to get rid of that. \nI would note at this event today that I covered they also had former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson there to make a statement because she was one of these women, these tipping point women, that started this national conversation. So, yeah, you know, there's just - there's significant momentum, and I would say this has bipartisan support. There's a lot of Republicans in support of this legislation who want to capture this cultural moment and send a message that it's time to sort of remake how we think about the American workplace. \nKELLY: And real quick, Sue, to circle you back to Al Franken - if he does say he's resigning, what happens to his seat? \nDAVIS: They have a Democratic governor, it's Mark Dayton. He would get to appoint an interim senator. He's a Democrat, so there's no chance this seat will flip in the short term. Whoever that senator is will have to run for re-election in the 2018 midterms. \nKELLY: And we'll see. Maybe he'll pick a woman. Who knows? Thanks very much, Sue. \nDAVIS: You're welcome. \nKELLY: That's NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis.

Electoral Commission is investigating whether Momentum, the left-wing group backing Jeremy Corbyn, broke election spending rules.\nThe watchdog announced it had opened a probe into whether the organisation spent above limits and failed to submit \u201caccurate donation information\u201d.\n\u201cQuestions over their compliance with the campaign finance rules at June\u2019s general election risks causing harm to voters\u2019 confidence in elections,\u201d said Bob Posner, the Commission\u2019s director of political finance.\n\u201cThere is significant public interest in us investigating Momentum to establish the facts in this matter and whether there have been any offences.\u201d The allegations are a blow to Momentum and to the Labour leader, after its staunch support helped propel Mr Corbyn to take a firm grip on the party.\nThe group was founded in 2015 by Jon Lansman, the veteran left-wing activist, to prevent moderate Labour MPs from unseating him, or resisting Mr Corbyn\u2019s leftward policy shift.\nIt has since grown to be hugely powerful, with networks across the country and members elected to key positions in local constituency parties and on the ruling National Executive Committee (NEC).\nMr Lansman himself is expected to grab one of three new seats on the NEC open to constituency members, in upcoming elections.\nThe Commission said the investigation would examine whether Momentum:\n* Spent \u201cin excess of the spending limits for an unauthorised non-party campaigner\u201d at the June general election.\n* Submitted a return that \u201cdid not include accurate donation information\u201d.\n* Submitted a return that \u201cwas not a complete statement of payments made in respect of controlled expenditure\u201d.\n* Submitted a return that \u201cdid not include all invoices for payments of more than \u00a3200\u201d.\nThe watchdog said it was \u201cpossible\u201d the inquiry would identify other potential breaches of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA).\nThe Commission\u2019s briefing note set out how \u201cnon-party campaigners\u201d are allowed to undertake \u201ctargeted spending\u201d, but only within prescribed limits.\nThey are \u00a331,980 in England, \u00a33,540 in Scotland, \u00a32,400 in Wales and \u00a31,080 in Northern Ireland - limits which apply in the year leading up to the 8 June election.\nThe note says: \u201cRegistered non-party campaigners are only entitled to spend above these limits if they have the authorisation of the political party that they are promoting.\n\u201cIf that party provides authorisation, the registered non-party campaigner can spend up to the limit authorised by the political party.\nHowever, it adds: \u201cShould the party provide authorisation for a higher spending limit, any spending by that non-party campaigner up to that limit would count towards the party\u2019s national spending limit.\u201d\nBut a Momentum spokesman downplayed the investigation, insisting it centred on \u201cadministrative errors that can be easily rectified\u201d.\n\u201cMomentum put a lot of effort and resources into detailed budgeting and financial procedures during the election to ensure full compliance,\u201d he said.\nSeparately, the Commission is already investigating both of the groups behind last year\u2019s Leave campaign in the Brexit referendum over spending.\nIt is examining whether Vote Leave, the group fronted by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, spent more than the \u00a37m limit.\nAnd it launched into an investigation into whether donations and loans from the Leave-Eu campaigner Arron Banks, and one of his companies, broke campaign finance rules.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

Chris Dwyer. BRENTWOOD \u2014 Portsmouth City Councilor M. Chris Dwyer has been hit with a defamation suit filed by a Portsmouth Toyota dealer over statements she made about him and his business during her recent bid for reelection.James Boyle of Rye filed suit in Rockingham County Superior Court last week alleging he and his business were defamed by Dwyer when he claims she made \u201cnumerous false factual statements\u201d that could dissuade customers and potential customers from doing business with him.Boyle is the majority owner of Minato Auto LLC, which operates Toyota of Portsmouth at 150 Greenleaf Ave.\u201cThe statements cast Mr. Boyle in a false and unfavorable light and caused damage to his personal reputation as well as his business reputation. In addition, they were designed to \u2018poison\u2019 potential electees to the City Council concerning various disputed issues between Mr. Boyle and the city of Portsmouth,\u201d the suit said.The suit describes Boyle as the \u201cface\u201d of the dealership and said the public \u201cclosely identifies\u201d him with the business.Boyle won a $3.57 million jury verdict against the city earlier this year for lost profits due to a city-owned sewer line at the back of his dealership property that he claimed had caused damage and prohibited expansion.The city is still at odds with Boyle, who claims there were errors in the two-week trial and that verdict should have been more than $10 million.The city also filed a notice in December 2016 that it was taking about a third of his property around the sewer line by eminent domain. Boyle and the city continue to dispute the land-taking issue and the amount of compensation.According to the suit, Dwyer was involved in many of the discussions on the sewer line lawsuit and the dealership property as a city official and voted for the land taking.\u201cThroughout the years in which Mr. Boyle tried to develop his property, Mrs. Dwyer has always been antagonistic towards Mr. Boyle, including publicly stating that one of his projects made her sick when she saw it even though it was lawfully approved,\u201d the suit said.Dwyer did not immediately return a call Wednesday seeking comment on the suit, which asks the court to award damages and attorney\u2019s fees to Boyle and Minato Auto.While running for reelection to the City Council this year, Boyle\u2019s suit alleges that Dwyer made \u201cmany false factual statements concerning Mr. Boyle or his property in connection with her campaign.\u201dThe suit said some of her responses to questions posed on a candidate survey on www.portsmouthnh.com related to Boyle and his property were \u201cfalse, defamatory and intended to cast Mr. Boyle and his business in a negative light.\u201dOne example cited in the suit was a comment she made when asked if she felt the council should have settled with Boyle for the amount he requested. Dwyer wrote \u201ccertainly not,\u201d and then stated that he bought a building on wetlands that was sinking and that he has been \u201ctrying to get taxpayers of the city of Portsmouth to pay for his apparent mistake through filing various lawsuits.\u201dShe also wrote that the wetlands and sewer lines were clearly marked on the deed for the property.The suit included a copy of a letter from Boyle\u2019s attorney, John Kuzinevich, that was sent to Dwyer dated Oct. 31 expressing concerns about some of her statements that he insisted were factually false and misleading.He wrote that her statement about trying to get the taxpayers to pay for his mistake was \u201cconfounding and libelous.\u201d\u201cMr. Boyle made no mistake in buying the site. He transformed it into a successful dealership and would expand but for the city\u2019s mistake concerning the sewer line and its continual vendetta against him to prevent development,\u201d the letter said.Kuzinevich also wrote that there had been a dispute about the extent of wetlands on the property, but the jury determined that any wetlands were created by the city\u2019s sewer line.He wrote that there has been \u201cabsolutely no evidence that the building itself was situated on wetlands.\u201dKuzinevich also insisted that there is no evidence that the building was sinking and disputed her claim that the wetlands and sewer lines were clearly marked on the deed. jschreiber@newstote.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jason schreiber", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "m. chris dwyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boyle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dwyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john kuzinevich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuzinevich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james boyle", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "toyota", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "minato auto llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rockingham county superior court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portsmouth toyota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portsmouth city", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "portsmouth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenleaf ave.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brentwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portsmouth city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:55.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b532ac331ce5769896e9c7c0ef3e43bdb7112522", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoySJuJVf3Wy9kIOLPEvcyeQ.jNo_LpzBOZPbRiEiVzdy4YHRiqYmkzib9z9guBYsE-", "site_full": "boatlife.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://boatlife.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Boatlife: Continuously Cruising                                                   Aboard NB Valerie", "title": "Breaking Ice!", "title_full": "Breaking Ice!", "published": "2017-12-05T20:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0e7afc1ee450b8037a99e970cce8417c95f5fc01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoySJuJVf3Wy9kIOLPEvcyeQ.jNo_LpzBOZPbRiEiVzdy4YHRiqYmkzllUQWulQWGTPrEvfRrdRgQ--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Bryce Lee", "published": "2017-12-05T21:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hmm yes winter is coming.

Adam Beam / AP Originally published on December 6, 2017 5:22 pm \nDavid Ermold once again stepped inside the Rowan County, Ky., courthouse on Wednesday, except this time he wasn't asking for a marriage license \u2014 he was asking for Kim Davis' job. She is the Rowan County clerk who refused Ermold and his partner, among other couples, a marriage license on the basis of her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage. \n\"I have an obligation here, really, to do this and to set things right,\" Ermold told The Associated Press about his decision to run for the position. \"I don't think the other candidates are looking at a larger message.\" \nErmold is an assistant professor of English at the University of Pikeville and has lived in Morehead, in the county, for more than a decade. He received a clear message from Davis when she twice denied him and his now-husband marriage licenses in the summer of 2015, after the Supreme Court effectively legalized same-sex marriage . \nDavis told Ermold that it was \"God's authority\" that kept her from complying with the Supreme Court. She spent time in jail for defying a federal judge's order, was sued by Ermold and Moore and other couples, and rose to international prominence as a symbol of the bitter divide over same-sex marriage, even meeting with the pope in 2015. \nLast month Davis announced that she would be running for re-election, seeking the judgment of voters for the first time since the controversy erupted. \nThe AP described the scene on Wednesday as Ermold, alongside his now-husband, filled out the paperwork to run for office with Davis sitting across from him: \n\"Davis smiled and welcomed them, chatting with them about the state retirement system and the upcoming Christmas holiday. She made sure Ermold had all of his paperwork and signatures to file for office, softly humming the old hymn 'Jesus Paid It All' as her fingers clacked across a keyboard. \n\"When it was over, she stood and shook hands with Ermold, telling him: 'May the best candidate win.' \" \nErmold and Moore finally married in the fall of 2015. \nErmold told Newsweek that he wants to send a message to people who have been discriminated against. \"We need to not just symbolize. We need to send a message out to all these people saying it's OK,\" Ermold said. \"You are important.\" \nErmold, who is running as a Democrat, told the AP that his campaign will be about more than LGBT issues and will focus on fairness and bringing people together. \nHe added, \"It doesn't matter whether I'm LGBT or not. If I'm qualified to do a job, I should be able to do the job.\" \nSocial issues aside, that job is in many ways simply about keeping records. As Ermold's campaign website pledges , \"As county clerk, I will act responsibly with taxpayer money, and I will seek out ways to be cost efficient ... and I will keep accurate records of all transactions.\" \nDavis no longer objects to issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples now that Kentucky changed the rules so clerks no longer have to attach their names to the licenses. \nBut she has maintained her opposition to same-sex marriage, even visiting Romania in October to urge that country to change its constitution to bar same-sex marriage. \nWhen asked on Wednesday whether she thinks she deserves to be re-elected, Davis, who is running as a Republican, told reporters, \"That will be up to the people. I think I do a good job.\" Copyright 2017 NPR.

Kurzfristig musste Ersatz f\u00fcr den Brasilien-Termin gefunden werden. Urspr\u00fcnglich h\u00e4tte am 17. M\u00e4rz der ePrix von Sao Paulo stattfinden sollen. Allerdings musste dieses Rennen, es w\u00e4re die Premiere auf dieser neuen Strecke gewesen, verschoben werden. Der Park, in dem sich der Kurs befinden wird, soll verkauft werden. Dieser Prozess verz\u00f6gert sich. \nFormel-E-Chef Alejandro Agag hatte aufgrund der politischen Situation schon l\u00e4nger eine Alternative im Hinterkopf. \"Die Situation in Sao Paulo war f\u00fcr mich bereits etwas unsicher\", meint Agag zu 'Motorsport-Total.com'. \"Die Politik in Brasilien ist kompliziert. Der B\u00fcrgermeister will das Gebiet, in dem das Rennen stattfinden soll, privatisieren. Also habe ich gesagt, wir sollten f\u00fcr den Fall der F\u00e4lle einen Ersatz parat haben. \nDie beiden bisherigen Rennen in Punta del Este wurden von Sebastien Buemi gewonnen. Damit war der Schweizer der erste Fahrer, der bei einem Rennen, das mindestens zweimal gefahren wurde, einen Rekord von 100 Prozent hatte. Diesen wiederholte er mit Siegen in Monaco 2015 und 2017. Dass es nun erneut nach Punta del Este gehen wird, sorgt f\u00fcr eine stabile Meisterschaft. \"Es ist wichtig, die Rennen und deren Frequenz zu halten.
