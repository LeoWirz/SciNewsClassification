This was a cross-sectional observational study by means of a quantitative survey of 1,000 general practitioners registered in Ireland exploring the frequency of diagnosis, methods of treatment and cost of AHZ and PHN in primary care. We recorded an 18% response rate ( n  =\u2009184) with an 83% completion rate ( n  =\u2009152/184). 80% of cases of AHZ occurred in patients aged 50 years or more with 81% of study participants encountering cases at a rate of 1\u20133 patients per month. Famciclovir (37%) and valaciclovir (36%) were the most commonly prescribed antiviral agents. Mild opioids (32%) were the most common analgesic agents used for first line AHZ pain, and pregabalin (37%) the most commonly prescribed analgesic agent for second line AHZ pain. Pregabalin was also the most commonly prescribed analgesic for both first and second line PHN pain (29% and 24%, respectively). The mean per-case direct cost (medication and GP visits) of treating AHZ and PHN in primary care was \u20ac195 (range \u20ac153\u2013\u20ac236) and \u20ac201 (range \u20ac140\u2013\u20ac313), respectively. Based on national sentinel data the estimated annual direct costs of treating AHZ and PHN in primary care is \u20ac2,278,196 (range \u20ac1,793,399\u2013\u20ac2, 763,445). The treatment of AHZ and PHN represents both a significant care and cost burden on primary care resources in Ireland in keeping with other European based studies.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AEd7yV", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ahz", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pregabalin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:57.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68d2a64dcabe289403edaf845e8aee7e6afb269a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqgAk4LN_6vb9TSb8mCHyw188Wv8mOrTuf1lCTPsunVjA5SOpM26dYQRiqpZlpeGydSI2xEc.jO1TxWxFL0mZiyuN1bv6zEF14", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9830007) Sen.

And if Franken resigns, every Democrat who's ever so much as taken a photo with a woman will risk accusations, whether or not they actually did anything or do anything to make amends later. Do you really think the GOP is above bribing women to accuse Democrats, or outright making them up? And if Democrats ditch Franken, they prove that they're willing to take those accusations at face value.\nThat would not only fark over the Democrats (because the Grand Old Pedophiles sure as Hell aren't gonna eject anyone for reasons like those), but it also weakens the entire point of the campaign, as actual victims risk being drowned out.\nAlso, remember that the GOP has the backing of a major power's intelligence agency, one well-known to be fond of disinformation campaigns and media manipulation. Everything that the Republicans do, or anything that appears to benefit them, should be taken with a bigass grain of salt.\nA couple handsful of Dems tanked Franken's political career today.\nThe best we can get at this point is for Dems to get their shiat together before the next set of allegations (that are sure to come forward) hit.\nAnd FFS if Dems don't pile the everloving fark onto Moore and Trump now... goddamnit I will break things in here and yell at my cat.\nA couple??? 39 Democratic senators as of now.\nI heard it was 102 Democrat senators, some borrowed from other multiverse.

Then I was. Then I wasn't. I've been hoping Franken would just step down and I wouldn't have to say anything. I've been hoping he's a decent enough man not to force his victims to parade in front of the Ethics Committee. I've been hoping I'd not ever have the moniker of \"Franken accuser.\"\nI understand why she doesn't want to be labeled as an accuser, but she was touting the standards of Democrats throughout the piece, and this just annoyed me. I don't know his full reasoning behind why he wants an ethics investigation, but any sane person that is against sexual harassment, assault or rape of someone of power should demand an ethics investigation. Yes, it will be hard on the victims, and since she is a Democrat that is accusing another Democrat, while knowing that a President that has been accused of worse than Franken, and a possible senator from Alabama that has a thing for going after underage girls; you would think she would be ok with talking to an ethics investigation.\nThis will stop shiat from being in closed doors with any person of power in government regardless of political affiliation. This can help start an investigation towards Moore (if he wins, he will win), and Trump. Yes, that is a very low chance, but it could happen if Democrats can win more seats in the next election. Making him resign now, does a disservice to what people are getting away with in our government, because it will keep settlements behind close doors, and lets Republican party keep letting their sexual assault accusers of being in power.\nI believe her, but an ethics investigation isn't about parading the victims, it is about letting them speak, and to force a standard for all politicians to get investigated if they get accused of anything ...\nI agree as well. This is a hit, even if the accusers are true, whereas the accusers of Moore were done with journalistic standards. I don't think the people that were looking into Moore were trying to bad talk him, they just wanted to get information about it him, and it uncovered dirt. Tweeden had an agenda, and probably told to wait to talk about it. The others? I am not sure, but it is a hit piece against Franken, and I say this believing the people who accused him.\nWhat he did was wrong, but nowhere near as bad what is going on with Moore or Trump. Both sides want Franken gone, without trying to investigate his allegations, and he wants an investigation. Yet, one side is still defending two people accused of sexual assault of a minor. That side doesn't want Franken investigated, because then they will have to be investigated as well.\nThat is what the woman from the Atlantic article bothers me more than Tweeden, or the others accusers of Fraken. Tweeden has an agenda, but the Atlantic writer, acted like she was this saint, because she was a Democrat, but at the same time self hating. She defended Bill Clinton, but then decides he is a rapist, because she was grabbed by the butt by Franken. If Kenneth Starr didn't use that as ammo about Bill, it probably wasn't legit enough to use.\nShe wants to call Franken out, but doesn't want him to be investigated for it, because it parades the victims. I get that Democrats have real expectations towards their own, if you rape, GTFO, but you are being hypocritical for not wanting someone investigated that wants to be investigated. Lady, you just don't want to go up to an ethics committee for whatever reason. Stop self hating, because there are some shiatty people in your party, do the right thing get everything looked into, so people that you don't like can be held to the same standards as the people that broke your heart.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:57.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68d2a64dcabe289403edaf845e8aee7e6afb269a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqgAk4LN_6vb9TSb8mCHyw188Wv8mOrTuf1lCTPsunVjA5SOpM26dYQRiqpZlpeGydSI2xEc.jO1TxWxFL0mZiyuN1bv6zEF14", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9830007) Sen.

But what are most of these mid-range phones missing on? The style quotient is definitely one. Huawei\u2019s youth-centric sub-brand Honor seems to be keen on filling this gap with the launch of its Honor 7X smartphone \u2013 the successor to its quite successful 6X variant. Drop and break? #Honor7X can keep you away from the trouble. Check it out what George did. #MaxYourView #Maxout Know more about #Honor7X : https://t.co/wCY8RZ4Osh pic.twitter.com/HJ9cA068LL \n\u2014 Honor Smartphone (@Honorglobal) December 6, 2017 \nThe 4GB RAM Honor 7X, launched for the Indian market at an event in London this week, won\u2019t cost you a fortune \u2013 a maximum of Rs 12,999 or Rs 15,999, depending on the variant you choose from the two on offer \u2014 and yet it could well make you want to display the phone in front of friends or foes with a sense of pride. \nThis is because of the taller-than-wider frame of the device and almost edge-to-edge display that give it a premium look. It looks like the smaller sibling of the premium Honor 8 Pro from the rear. \nThe metal unibody design and bigger body-to-screen ratio add to the dashing look. \nSo much for the appearance. Let\u2019s see what works for the phone and what does not. \nOne big plus is its big screen and a full-HD+ display. The importance of a 5.93-inch screen is not skin deep, as heavy users of smartphones would know. \nAlso Read : 6GB Honor V10 with AI-enabled coming to India in January \nWith 18:9 aspect ratio, which is hardly available on a phone below Rs 15,000, and \u201cFull View\u201d HD+ display, Honor 7X ensures enriching video viewing experience. This is something gamers would also like as they get an edge of a wider view of the plot. \nPowered by the 2.36GHz octa-core \u201cKirin 659\u201d processor, the device runs Android 7.0 Nougat operating system (OS) with the company\u2019s custom EMUI 5.1 running on top. \nThe pricing differentiator of the two variants is the internal storage. The 32GB variant costs Rs 3,000 less than the 64GB variant. But both variants provide the option of expanding memory up to 256GB via hybrid micro-SD card slots. \nA big screen and better display would favour long hours of use. But does the battery of the phone back it up? The 3,340mAh battery does a good job in this regard. With 7X, light to moderate users do not even need to charge the phone every day. \nIn comparison, Xiaomi\u2019s Mi A1, which is also a 4GB RAM phone with 64GB onboard storage, packs a smaller 3,080mAh battery. \nThe Honor 7X has also equipped its cameras with fun and useful features. Clicking a selfie with this phone is all the more easier as its 8MP front camera comes with a gesture control which means you simply have to turn your palm to the camera to trigger a countdown to click a selfie. \nThe dual-lens 16MP + 2MP primary camera captures images in great detail and depth. It allows you to take pictures in wide-aperture mode, portrait mode, and even to click a moving picture, a feature that we first saw in iPhone 6S. \nThe pictures also snap colours in their vivid glories. \nWhat makes this dual rear camera stand out is its \u201cPhase Detection Auto Focus\u201d (PDAF) technology which offers ultra-fast focus time, making it easier to take pictures in fleeting moments. \nThe eye-comfort mode filters out blue light to help relieve visual fatigue. This feature makes reading books on the phone a delight. \nWhat does not work for the phone? \nDespite the fancy features on its cameras, the photos come out grainy in low-light conditions, especially with the front shooter. \nSurprisingly, the device uses the older micro USB 2.0 connector rather than the newer USB Type-C. \nAnd thanks to its size, some may even find it difficult to navigate the phone with one hand. \nConclusion: Overall, we feel that Honor 7X is a hardy phone with dashing disposition and has the potential to give mid-range phones of other Chinese players, such as Xiaomi and Motorola, a stiff competition. It offers a big screen bonanza for affordable smartphone seekers. \n\u2014 IANS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hardy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "george", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "motorola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ians", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:58.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68d2a64dcabe289403edaf845e8aee7e6afb269a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqgAk4LN_6vb9TSb8mCHyw188Wv8mOrTuf1lCTPsunVjA5SOpM26dYQRiqpZlpeGydSI2xEc.jO1TxWxFL0mZiyuN1bv6zEF14", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9830007) Sen.

That makes you about as thoughtful and patriotic as the average Trump voter.\nI'll preface this by stating that I don't believe Franken has intentionally groped or sexually assaulted any women, but holding yourself to a higher standard means nothing if it doesn't win more seats.\nIf the Trump voters aren't going to turn on theirs for indiscretions, drawing a line in the sand over what we won't accept in our own elected officials leads to the ousting of powerful voices without reciprocity on the other side, and taking that moral stance doesn't lead to more Democrats being elected, it's not the right move.\nIt doesn't matter how pure the party can say it is if it doesn't win enough seats to take control and actually pass legislation.

She believes a man putting his hand around her waist diminishes her as a professional woman? She comes across as a raving loon.\nYou're not that special. None of us are that special. Making such a big deal about someone's hand briefly being somewhere you'd rather it not be implies a level of self-centered delusion that I can't really understand.\nHow does claptrap like that even get published?\nShe had a photo, so they thought she was credible enough to write about it. I believe her that she felt violated, and I understand him grabbing her in area would be upsetting. However, she comes across as very righteous, and very close minded. Her article states that she defended Bill Clinton for years, because Democrat, now she sees him as a rapist. She was kind of blaming her experience of what happened to her with Franken, as an eye opening experience. She has such high standards that one little misstep, well fark it burn it down. Bill Clinton has been accused of rape by one person, that kept changing her story. Kenneth Starr knew about her, if he believed her enough, she would have been better ammo to use against Bill than the blue dress.\nSo far, there has been three that I know of anonymous accusers of butt grabbing, one accusation of groping in a photo, and a bad practice kiss, two people accusing of butt grabbing, and one inappropriate kiss. The first accusation hit job, the rest not sure. There are too many accusations to say they are all lying, but the last and first accusation doesn't want an ethic investigation. That pisses me off, especially with the last accuser. You don't want to talk to the ethics committee about it, but you sure have no problem spending hours on an article about what happened to you. Resigning isn't going to solve this problem, you want the problem like sexual assault to stop in politics? You investigate the shiat out of it, so it will help others to come forward. This will stop politicians from paying out their victims behind closed doors, and to keep their power.\nI told my mom this story, and she was like this is all farking bullshiat. My mom was molested as a child, and she was raped as an adult. Her friend raped her, and she threatened to cut his dick off if he did to her or anyone else again. She told him off at a bar. Everyone knew what he did.\nMy mom thinks what is happening to Franken is a witch hunt, because he never tried to put his hand down anyone's clothing, or tried to force himself on him. She thinks this is belittling survivors. She told me she thinks an investigation is better than resigning, because and I Quote: , \"What good is it gonna do?\" She has a point, is this going to hold higher standards to people like Trump or Moore? The only thing it might do is force victims from Democrats to come forward, but that is it. If a victim that was assaulted or harassed by someone from the Republican party, what good is to them to come forward?

It was just a matter of getting through it and I\u2019ll get a few more games in the next two or three weeks and see where we are.

I want to be there because I can make an impact.\u201d \nIt has been nearly 20 months since Judge made an appearance for the first team and he has been using his absence to improve his body, insisting he is in better shape than ever. \nHe said: \u201cWhen I had the first op, I was told a year but from the first day of rehab when they put a towel under my foot for me to try to scrunch my toes together, having not moved for two or three weeks, I knew it was going to be a long process. \n\u201cI\u2019d really wanted to get back last season but deep down I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be 100 per cent and I ended up having the second op.

And I am physically stronger and better than I have ever been. The way I am feeling now, I definitely feel as though I can play for longer than maybe I expected to, bar injury of course. \n\u201cAnd, although I have obviously had a very serious injury, I am not an injury-prone player so I am optimistic. \n\u201cOne thing I had always wanted to work on was my leg strength and that has improved massively. I spent a lot of time with the sports science and strength and conditioning people and they\u2019ve had me on a great programme. \n\u201cWhen you are playing in the Championship, you don\u2019t get that time to work on those things. If you\u2019re playing Tuesday, Saturday, Tuesday for two or three weeks, you don\u2019t have time to train, let alone anything else. So I definitely think I will be better in that regard. \n\u201cIt might take me a while to get the sharpness back but I\u2019m sure people will be understanding about that given how long I have been out for.\u201d Like us on Facebook", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dean smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul burgman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan judge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lewis macleod", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "brentford", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fulham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barnet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:02:58.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68d2a64dcabe289403edaf845e8aee7e6afb269a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqgAk4LN_6vb9TSb8mCHyw188Wv8mOrTuf1lCTPsunVjA5SOpM26dYQRiqpZlpeGydSI2xEc.jO1TxWxFL0mZiyuN1bv6zEF14", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/politics/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Politics links", "title": "(9830007) Sen.

She believes a man putting his hand around her waist diminishes her as a professional woman? She comes across as a raving loon.\nYou're not that special. None of us are that special. Making such a big deal about someone's hand briefly being somewhere you'd rather it not be implies a level of self-centered delusion that I can't really understand.\nHow does claptrap like that even get published?\nShe had a photo, so they thought she was credible enough to write about it. I believe her that she felt violated, and I understand him grabbing her in area would be upsetting. However, she comes across as very righteous, and very close minded. Her article states that she defended Bill Clinton for years, because Democrat, now she sees him as a rapist. She was kind of blaming her experience of what happened to her with Franken, as an eye opening experience. She has such high standards that one little misstep, well fark it burn it down. Bill Clinton has been accused of rape by one person, that kept changing her story. Kenneth Starr knew about her, if he believed her enough, she would have been better ammo to use against Bill than the blue dress.\nSo far, there has been three that I know of anonymous accusers of butt grabbing, one accusation of groping in a photo, and a bad practice kiss, two people accusing of butt grabbing, and one inappropriate kiss. The first accusation hit job, the rest not sure. There are too many accusations to say they are all lying, but the last and first accusation doesn't want an ethic investigation. That pisses me off, especially with the last accuser. You don't want to talk to the ethics committee about it, but you sure have no problem spending hours on an article about what happened to you. Resigning isn't going to solve this problem, you want the problem like sexual assault to stop in politics? You investigate the shiat out of it, so it will help others to come forward. This will stop politicians from paying out their victims behind closed doors, and to keep their power.\nI told my mom this story, and she was like this is all farking bullshiat. My mom was molested as a child, and she was raped as an adult. Her friend raped her, and she threatened to cut his dick off if he did to her or anyone else again. She told him off at a bar. Everyone knew what he did.\nMy mom thinks what is happening to Franken is a witch hunt, because he never tried to put his hand down anyone's clothing, or tried to force himself on him. She thinks this is belittling survivors. She told me she thinks an investigation is better than resigning, because and I Quote: , \"What good is it gonna do?\" She has a point, is this going to hold higher standards to people like Trump or Moore? The only thing it might do is force victims from Democrats to come forward, but that is it. If a victim that was assaulted or harassed by someone from the Republican party, what good is to them to come forward? Trump is in office, been accused many times, and Moore is probably going to be a Senator even with the evidence against him.\nYour mom is a smart, strong woman.
