The theft happened on Sunday at Fastway LLC at 4204 Thompson St. before the business opened. The man was caught on a neighboring business' surveillance camera. He was seen loading up equipment from the yard of the business into the back of a white pickup truck. He stole a toolbox, lawnmower, barbecue grill, hand truck, and a sump pump. The suspect was wearing a PPA uniform with an old logo. The PPA says that a uniform was stolen from a vehicle in Bridesburg three weeks ago. If you recognize the vehicle or have any information contact Philadelphia Police. Two men are in critical condition after a drive-by shooting in Philadelphia's Tioga-Nicetown neighborhood. It happened after 7:30 p.m. on the 3600 block of North Sydenham Street. The victims were sitting in a minivan when the shooter pulled up in a red vehicle and opened fire. Eleven shell casing were found. The victims started to drive away but crashed into a parked car. The 22-year-old male victims were each taken to Temple University Hospital in critical condition suffering from multiple gun shot wounds. Police are looking for a motive and suspects in the case. An appeals court has again denied Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill's lawyer's request that he be released on bail. The legal team originally filed the Emergency Writ Of Habeas Corpus in Pennsylvania Superior Court back in late November claiming that Common Pleas Court Judge Genece Brinkley had not yet responded to several post-sentencing motions including one on bail and another asking for her recusal. The Superior Court denied that emergency motion, but directed the lower court to hold a bail hearing \"without further delay.\" On Monday, December 4th, Judge Brinkley denied bail at a hearing saying that Robert Williams was a \"danger to the community\" and a flight risk. This decision was immediately appealed, but Superior Court denied that second appeal on Wednesday. Per the court docket , \"bail pending disposition of the motion for modification of sentence is DENIED.\" He will remain in prison while the 2-4 year sentence stemming from parole violations is appealed.

He stayed hidden by bushes, his car abandoned somewhere far beyond in the dark. His goal was the gas station he had passed by not too long ago. Again he stumbled and fell on his knees, breathing heavy, fighting through the pain. His body yearned for him to get some rest and heal. But yet he was driven on by his hate. And rage. The looming shadow of his own failure. And his voices. They screamed at him. Scolded him. For a moment he pressed his eyes shut, trying to get the voices out of his mind. But still, they whispered to him about shame and failure. He had been so close, so very close. And yet his opportunities to fulfil his destiny had slipped away from his grasp one by another, leaving him nothing but his all-consuming hatred. In front of him, he saw the lights of the gas station through his blurry vision. He needed another car. He needed to get a distance between him and the place of his failure. He needed...rest. With a low growl, he forced himself up on unsteady legs. His knees shook, threatening to buckle, while he felt dizzy. Yet he willed himself to go on, his new goal only a few a feet away. He watched the man refill the tank of his van. Watched as he went in to pay, leaving the car unattended. Now was his chance. Silent as a shadow he slipped out of the dark and onto the backseat of the man's car. He didn't need to wait long for the man to return. He heard the engine start, felt the car begin to move slowly. Slowly he sat up, just as the man looked into the rearview mirror. With a surprised intake of air, the man hit the breaks, stopping the car and turned to confront the stowaway. He never spoke a word as his throat was slit by a sharp knife. The murderer got out from the backseat and pulled the body out of the driver's seat. Nonchalantly he let him rest face down in the dirt and sped away on I-76 E. Away from his failure waiting for his time to come.Jason awoke from a deep sleep, which made him wonder. He seldom slept, since he came back from the grave for the first time. Normally he just would go still until it was time for him to go out and hunt. And yet, here he lay, feeling alive and rested. Yawning he stretched his legs out, before carefully turning over. Mairi still slept by his side. The look on her face was so peaceful and content. Jason thought back to yesterday. To the fair, to the feeling of walking arm in arm. And to their night. What they had done. For a moment he a slight frown appeared on his face. He had done the bad thing, his mother had always told him about. And yet it had felt so good. He sighed with contempt, deep down knowing that what they had done was different from what his mother meant. He knew that his soul now belonged to Mairi. He was her's now, truly hers, she had claimed him. And he knew that she loved him unconditionally. She had shown it to him on so many levels. She loved him for who he was. And this had somewhat healed his crippled soul.Carefully he ran one finger down from her shoulder to the soft curve of her round hips and let his huge hand rest there. He knew now what the warm feeling, that blossomed in his chest was. He had fallen head over heels in love with her. She stirred beneath his hand and opened her eyes with a soft moan. Jason bent down, kissing her full lips softly. As a response, she snuggled closer to his chest, lightly caressing his flank. It sent a shiver down his spine. Making him want more. She still had her eyes closed as she let her hand wander further down. Let it run lightly over his powerful thigh and to his manhood. As she cubbed him, he already was aroused. A gentle squeeze made him groan softly. She smiled into his chest before rolling over on her back. She, too, found herself wanting again, could already feel the throbbing of her sex and the accompanying wetness between her leg. She let him settle between her legs, while her hands roamed his body. He kissed her, on his mouth, her neck her breast, pressing his hard member inquiringly against her. She lifted her hips and let him slip in. This is going to be a great day She thought, just before her thoughts were drowned out by pleasure. Later that noon she found him on the porch in an old rocking chair, deeply lost in his thoughts. With surprise, she noticed, that he still wasn't wearing his mask, but was fiddling with. With a happy smile, she came over and eased herself on his lap, leaning against his chest. He wrapped his arms around her, almost cradling her like a child, while he kept rocking back and forth. For a while, both were silent, lost in their own thoughts. Unknowingly they both thought about the other.\u201cI liked waking up next to you.\u201dMairi broke their contemplative silence, absent-mindedly stroking his arm. \"I liked what we did this as well.\"She continued, her hand slowly wandered from his arm to his broad chest.\u201cDo you mind sharing the bed with me more often?\u201dShe felt his light chuckle vibrate through his chest. Do you really need to ask? Mairi smiled to herself. Of course, she knew the answer already, yet she just had felt the need to ask him. Needed him to affirm, that he enjoyed it as much as she did. Afraid, that she might be dreaming all along. Afraid, that she might have jumped from the bridge after all and was now in a deep coma and this happy world was little more than just a figment of her dying mind. And yet, it had all felt too real to be just mere imagination. She let out a deep content sigh. Maybe life isn't such a lemon after all. She thought, remembering how she had felt a couple of months ago. Maybe everything happens for a reason. My decision to kill me, the lightning and my new found gift. Maybe this was meant to happen. Curious if her lover felt the same way, she inquired.\u201cJason? Out of all your victims... why did you spare me?\u201dShe felt his chest heave with a deep breath, while he thought about an answer. I don't know. He finally answered. Somehow I couldn't bring myself to do it, even though you really annoyed me at first. He stopped and she could feel him cock his head. I've often thought about it. I've even started to think, that my mother sent you to me. To make me happy. Mairi squeezed his arm gently. Mairi? She heard his voice in her mind after a while. I'm scared. She straightened up and turned towards to face him.\u201cOf what?\u201dShe asked her voice soft. His gaze, that had lingered on the lake's sparkling surface, slowly turned towards her. Of losing you. She leaned towards him and planted a soft kiss on his lips. \u201cJason, I love you, I won't leave you.\u201dHe smiled briefly. That's not what I meant... Another deep breath. Sometimes people come here to hurt me, to hunt me. Some come here armed. I'm afraid of what would happen if they wander into your cabin. Mairi, you are my greatest weakness now. If anything would happen to you... She put her fingers to his lips, even though he had not spoken. \u201cDon't think about this kind of things. We'll enjoy our given time together, you understand? Besides, you are here to keep me safe.\u201dHe nodded. Mairi leant in and closed her eyes, touching her lips to his in a loving kiss. When they finally broke for air, she settled back against his chest, watching the lake and the sky while listening to the sound of her lover's heart.It was early evening when the stolen car finally sputtered and died on a road in the middle of nowhere. He let it roll out on the dirt strip along the road. The man abandoned it, just like he had the other one. How long had he been on the road? 13 hours? More? A day perhaps?He couldn't tell, he had lost count of the time. He stumbled through thickening undergrowth and vanished amongst the shadows of the high trees of the deep forest he was in. By now, he felt miserable. Briefly, he wondered how he had managed to come so far. He was dizzy and barely able to see. His body hurt and some of the wounds that were inflicted on him still oozed blood. Besides, he had difficulty breathing, knowing that his lung had been hurt as well. He tried to clear his mind. Where was he? He didn't know, hadn't paid any attention at all. He just had fled. With a stolen car he just drove away from his hometown, down the interstate until his car ran out of fuel, just like the last one. But he knew that he needed shelter. Soon. His body craved for rest and he knew by experience, that his body would claim the rest, he didn't want to give willingly, sooner or later. And though he had always healed fast, he had been gravely wounded. In the back of his mind, he feared he might die after all, so highly unlikely. Still, he felt so tired and drained.And then his foot caught in a root, causing him to fall face first into the dirt. He tried to get up. Tried to will his body to rise but this time his body betrayed him. He turned his head to the side and looked around. He was surrounded by trees. High trees that seemed to close in on him, as if to ridicule his weakened state. Just like his voices ridiculed him for his failure and urged him on. His vision blurred again, then it darkened till he was taken down into a black void. The last thing he smelled was the mouldy smell of rotting leaves. The last thing he heard was heavy steppes of booted feet. Or maybe it was his own heartbeat booming in his ears? Heavy footsteps on the porch announced the arrival of Jason. He had been prowling the camp-grounds, just as the sun was about setting. Every day he would venture out by dusk, more out of habit than out of the need to kill something. By now, early November the camp lay abandoned. The lake was icy and the days were cold. Teens would start to pour in again next year when summer returned. Mairi was in her kitchen washing dishes, as she heard the front door open and close and turned with a smile. A smile that faded, as she saw his rigid body. Instantly she began to worry that something had happened to him.\u201cJason? What is it?\u201d Come. I want to show you something. He said instead of an answer, asking himself why he was showing her what he had found in the woods. Jason led her through the forest. In the darkness, Mairi was bearly able to see where she was going, but he took her by the hand and navigated her through the foliage with determination. He knew the woods insight and out and was sure-footed and Mairi trusted him enough fully, even though she did bring a flashlight with her.Finally, they stopped in front a body and Jason signalled for her to turn the flashlight on. The beam of the torch hit the body of a man in a dirty blue mechanics coverall. As soon her mind registered that she was staring at a body, she turned her head to the side, eyes closed. Mairi had worked in hospitals long enough to recognize the dark stains as what they were. Drying blood. \u201cOh, Jason, what....\u201dShe started but he pointed at the man. He is not dead. Not yet. And for once I didn't even touch him. Mairi looked down again. He lay on his stomach, the collar of his coverall turned upwards to his messy brown hairline and a pale almost white face was turned to the side. And indeed she could hear raspy faint breaths, that were far too shallow and short to be healthy. She looked up in confusion.\"Why did you bring me here?\"She asked, her voice a little too shaky for her liking. The big killer shrugged almost casually. He just would not die. I was watching him for a while before I got you and despite his bloodloss, he just would not stop breathing. Slowly Mairi nodded, surprised how one could cling to life so much that he just did not allow his broken body to die. Mairi took a deep breath in.\u201cCan you turn him around please?\u201dShe asked her friend. Jason nodded sharply and turned the body around with the tip of his toe. The sight made Mairi gasp. The man's chest, abdomen, thighs and arms were literally riddled with bullet holes. Blood had soaked the coverall and gave it a shiny blackish colour in the torchlight. She looked up at Jason, who watched her every move carefully. He tilted his head to the side. What do you think of this? Mairi shrugged. \u201cWhoever tried to kill the poor guy made a miserable job.\u201dShe paused, shining the light on the man's face and took a surprised step back, reaching out for Jason's arm for support.\u201cI know that guy.\u201d Is he a friend of yours? Mairi shook her head. \u201cNo, he was a patient.\u201dShe looked up at him. \u201cYou know when I worked at the mental asylum? He was an inmate there, killed his sister as a child...killed a lot of people actually. And in his time in the asylum, he barely uttered a word.\u201dJason frowned. I don't need any competition in these woods. He paused and looked down at the bleeding man, considering if he should just stomp on his neck and end his misery. But then he remembered not to kill in front of Mairi. Let's go home. He said mentally and turned. Surely the guy would die in a matter of time. But Mairi didn't follow. He turned and took her hand in his, trying to lead her away with mild force. But the little nurse slipped out of his grip. As he turned to look at her, she already knelt beside the man and unzipped the coverall to look at his wounds. Jason flinched inwardly, beginning to think that he made a big mistake bringing her. \u201cWe can't just leave him here, Jason. I worked on his ward a long time and I somehow still feel responsible.\u201dJason grew frustrated. He knew it. I don't want a nutcase running around here! Mairi looked up, sensing Jason's frustration. She sighed, stepping over to him and circled her arms around his waist, pressing herself against his powerful body as she pleaded.\u201cI don't think that he will stay long. He doesn't belong here. Please, Jason. I just can't leave him to die alone. And who knows? Perhaps you'll get along just fine.\u201dJason looked down into her big pleading eyes. I doubt it... He took a deep breath in. Fine. But if he touches you, or annoys me, he is dead. Mairi smiled.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mairi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:31.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61fd7cf071d9a1a188f7f3248486b4fbe1b62f02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KvwQYjvte6ZRse7e.oI44USRpLgdsTa9fNIhEvY_4r8G3Nzwq3GPvoE7PIexAbV0E0HAFNSoQSQXCHhjtEGYbWKTOhVRM6zulBlWC8Iy2fCPhyVFAXmzg", "site_full": "www.browndailyherald.com", "site": "browndailyherald.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tennis", "mens_health", "health", "sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u201cA Night at Sea\u201d full of outrageous laughs, devilish fun", "title_full": "\u201cA Night at Sea\u201d full of outrageous laughs, devilish fun", "published": "2017-12-07T06:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.159, "main_image": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/wp-content/themes/browndailyherald/images/facebook-default.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "61fd7cf071d9a1a188f7f3248486b4fbe1b62f02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KvwQYjvte6ZRse7e.oI44USRpLgdsTa9fNIhEvY_4r8G3Nzwq3GPvoE7PIexAbV0E0HAFNSoQSQXCHhjtEGYbWKTOhVRM6zulBlWC8Iy2fCPhyVFAXmzg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Daniel Wayland", "published": "2017-12-07T06:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "\u201cA Night at Sea\u201d full of outrageous laughs, devilish fun", "text": "\u201cA Night at Sea\u201d full of outrageous laughs, devilish fun Brown\u2019s Out of Bounds sketch comedy displays creative genius, showmanship skills Arts & Culture Critic Wednesday, December 6, 2017 Brown\u2019s Out of Bounds sketch comedy team hosted its \u201cA Night at Sea\u201d performance Saturday night in front of a boisterous crowd at MacMillan Hall. If the group\u2019s performance was any indication of life on the high seas, sign me up for the next vessel leaving Providence harbor. Of course, the sketches didn\u2019t actually have anything to do with seamanship or nautical minutiae \u2014 not a single sketch even occurred at sea (with the exception of the opening vignette, which largely served to introduce the team\u2019s new cast members). Nevertheless, every sketch was a compact display of creative genius and showmanship. \u201cA Night at Sea\u201d was awash with uproarious highlights. So where does one even begin? I\u2019ll start in the middle of the show, with a sketch that left me in a fit of gleeful spasms. Emily Adams \u201918 stars as a Bogart-esque film noir detective, complete with a cigarette and trench coat. She has arrived at an unnamed office for a job interview but bewilders the interviewer and audience with a seemingly deranged series of cocksure overtures. She is convinced the man she is investigating is hiding inside of the office\u2019s filing cabinet. In a wonderful reveal that subverts the audience\u2019s expectations of the absurd, we learn that this man is in fact hiding in the filing cabinet. The detective role requires a committed and inspired performance, which Adams offers in spades. It\u2019s a perfect marriage of great writing and acting: The sketch captures the noir detective trope\u2019s wacky and antiquated vernacular cadences, and Adams nailed the delivery. Other highlights included \u201cGary,\u201d the hilariously out-of-place and inappropriate druggy clown auditioning to play a superhero in a sanitized production meant for child viewers. Chautaqua Ordway \u201920 gave a standout performance as Gary in his inaugural show with the sketch company. A sketch about a visual arts class in which the day\u2019s nude model is a little too familiar with the artists is similarly entertaining. Moreover, the model sketch demonstrates the writers\u2019 great sense of comedic life-span: the joke which the scene is centered around is funny to a point, and the team moves on just before the humor grows stale. Indeed, time and space are not wasted in \u201cA Night at Sea.\u201d The Out of Bounds team manages to mine humor from just about every walk of life and scenario \u2014 from an imaginative soccer goalie to a gonzo Career Lab professional to the SAT to the Boston Tea Party. They built so much comedic trust over the course of the show that I was almost disappointed if every upcoming sketch didn\u2019t surpass the previous one in laughs. That\u2019s about the only complaint I can muster \u2014 \u201cA Night at Sea\u201d was a fabulous lark.

On my way home this uber driver decides to have a therapeutic session with me. He already lays down the rules. Young lady I don't know you but am going to need you to be quiet and listen to me. Being the ultimate Aquarius lady, I feel cornered and very uneasy. Should I cancel this trip or report him? Why did I suggest this route though? \nI am in a shitty marriage. He finally discloses. That is all he has to about his wife. So it has come to this? It is how he says it that makes me momentarily laugh but then his voice calms down and in almost a whisper he confesses but there is this lady. She is a ray of hope. I could tell because he slowed down and smiled when he talked about her. She is a doctor. I love doctors  and intelligent ladies he openly admits. He is very specific with the words he uses regarding this lady. So I assume this selfish prick is cheating rather than making it work in his shitty marriage. She has a boyfriend and he has a baby mama. This is sheer madness. The question I am dying to ask is if he knows his wife is cheating on him as well but having referred to what they have as shitty he would care less. So the therapist in me shuts my curious mouth and opt to listen instead. \nI have another girlfriend in the States. At this point am judging him and wondering of how many men like him exist. It's dark in the car but I could almost swear I saw him blush. I ignored my current girlfriend for her. We took romantic pictures together. So they slept together I assumed. She promised to come back for me. You delusional man. I can't.  I refuse. Stop the car. This must be a test from God. I am in my late 40s but I am in a shitty marriage. When he repeated that a second time I almost slapped him. It takes two to tango so don't play victim. You are forty damn it get your shit together. \nAm I crazy? That is an understatement I thought to myself. There was no sexual talk which I was looking out for so I gave him my honest opinion. That is when it hit me. We hear but we never listen as women when men tell us what they want.  He said. He told me. It has been two months and he is inlove with her. We talk. She listens to me. \nThis man and so many others out there are looking for female companionship. There are three types of women. The independent I don't need a man just donate your sperm and leave. The I would rather die in this than be labelled as single. The we will make this work get your shit together don't you dare bring me that bullshit and I run this house. Men are very selfish and women should ape that. In the words of my bestfriend don't be Miss Echo Chamber aka yes sir. You always agree and never question anything. Have an opinion no matter how dumb it is, say it.  If the two of you aren't bestfriends by now no matter how alien the freak in them violins your demons let it go. \nWhere there is friendship there is respect. A real man knows how to respect a woman, because he knows the feeling if someone would disrespect his mother. Miss Echo Chamber you have mastered and can predict that man but you don't know him well enough to be his friend to call him out on his bullshit. Real friends are not afraid to lose you. They always say the ugly truth out of love. They tell you what no one else is bold enough to say.

Now Kentucky Man Seeks Her Job", "text": "By Amy Held \u2022 10 hours ago David Ermold files to run for Rowan County Clerk as Kim Davis looks on, two years after Davis denied Ermold and his now-husband a marriage license because she was opposed to same-sex marriage. Adam Beam / AP Originally published on December 6, 2017 8:22 pm \nDavid Ermold once again stepped inside the Rowan County, Ky., courthouse on Wednesday, except this time he wasn't asking for a marriage license \u2014 he was asking for Kim Davis' job. She is the Rowan County clerk who refused Ermold and his partner, among other couples, a marriage license on the basis of her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage. \n\"I have an obligation here, really, to do this and to set things right,\" Ermold told The Associated Press about his decision to run for the position. \"I don't think the other candidates are looking at a larger message.\" \nErmold is an assistant professor of English at the University of Pikeville and has lived in Morehead, in the county, for more than a decade. He received a clear message from Davis when she twice denied him and his now-husband marriage licenses in the summer of 2015, after the Supreme Court effectively legalized same-sex marriage . \nDavis told Ermold that it was \"God's authority\" that kept her from complying with the Supreme Court. She spent time in jail for defying a federal judge's order, was sued by Ermold and Moore and other couples, and rose to international prominence as a symbol of the bitter divide over same-sex marriage, even meeting with the pope in 2015. \nLast month Davis announced that she would be running for re-election, seeking the judgment of voters for the first time since the controversy erupted. \nThe AP described the scene on Wednesday as Ermold, alongside his now-husband, filled out the paperwork to run for office with Davis sitting across from him: \n\"Davis smiled and welcomed them, chatting with them about the state retirement system and the upcoming Christmas holiday. She made sure Ermold had all of his paperwork and signatures to file for office, softly humming the old hymn 'Jesus Paid It All' as her fingers clacked across a keyboard. \n\"When it was over, she stood and shook hands with Ermold, telling him: 'May the best candidate win.' \" \nErmold and Moore finally married in the fall of 2015. \nErmold told Newsweek that he wants to send a message to people who have been discriminated against. \"We need to not just symbolize. We need to send a message out to all these people saying it's OK,\" Ermold said. \"You are important.\" \nErmold, who is running as a Democrat, told the AP that his campaign will be about more than LGBT issues and will focus on fairness and bringing people together. \nHe added, \"It doesn't matter whether I'm LGBT or not. If I'm qualified to do a job, I should be able to do the job.\" \nSocial issues aside, that job is in many ways simply about keeping records. As Ermold's campaign website pledges , \"As county clerk, I will act responsibly with taxpayer money, and I will seek out ways to be cost efficient ... and I will keep accurate records of all transactions.\" \nDavis no longer objects to issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples now that Kentucky changed the rules so clerks no longer have to attach their names to the licenses. \nBut she has maintained her opposition to same-sex marriage, even visiting Romania in October to urge that country to change its constitution to bar same-sex marriage. \nWhen asked on Wednesday whether she thinks she deserves to be re-elected, Davis, who is running as a Republican, told reporters, \"That will be up to the people. I think I do a good job.\"   \u00a9 2017 WABE 90.1 FM", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kim davis", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "david ermold", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "amy", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam beam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ermold", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rowan county clerk", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "university of pikeville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newsweek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rowan county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ky.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morehead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:32.040+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "24678a336b843b10b22d9ac21fdbd6d4c85c1820", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAigmDs.YzCGE9Qd5Z2fPJFvc-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/gmail/account-access-and-safety", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Gmail Help Forum - Google Product Forums", "title": "I am not able to recover me google account", "title_full": "I am not able to recover me google account - Google Product Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.google.com/images/icons/product/groups-128.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "24678a336b843b10b22d9ac21fdbd6d4c85c1820", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAigmDs.YzCGE9Qd5Z2fPJFvc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "neelesh gupta 2721212", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "I am not able to recover me google account", "text": "Hi all, I am not able to recover me google account password with my alternate email.

Fun Fact: Airbnb currently has over 1,400 castles you can rent out. Today, we know Airbnb as the $25 billion behemoth that serves as a platform for homeowners to rent out their homes to vacationers and travelers\u200a\u2014\u200abut once upon a time, Airbnb was rather underwhelming . Brian Chesky and the lost boys (his cofounders) stumbled upon the idea of Airbnb after finding themselves unable to pay rent on their pricey San Francisco apartment. They did what most sane individuals strapped for cash would do\u200a\u2014\u200ablew up three air mattresses in a spare bedroom, served breakfast and rented them out to complete strangers. Hence the name, Airbed & Breakfast (Airbnb). Well, to everyone\u2019s surprise, three guests showed up, shelled out $80 a piece and boom-shocka-locka! Brian and the lost boys had their rent money and didn\u2019t have to live in a box on the street. Fast-forward several months and the overzealous entrepreneurs found themselves $20,000 in debt\u200a\u2014\u200a they literally filled a binder with dozens of credit cards and maxed them out to build the beginnings of Airbnb. Some would call this stupid\u2026 actually, most would call this stupid. So, how on God\u2019s green earth do you pay off $20,000 in credit card debt, quickly? Sell cereal boxes, of course The debt collectors started ringing at the perfect time, right before the 2008 Obama-McCain Election. The Airbnb squad had yet another bright idea\u2026 \u201cBoys, what if we designed and sold limited edition cereal boxes and called them Obama O\u2019s & Captain McCain?\u201d They then contacted a print shop to have 1,000 custom boxes printed, bought a shit ton of cereal (Cherrios and Captain Crunch), put the boxes together with a hot glue gun in their apartment and slapped on a $40 price tag. A leprechaun must have tickled their nuts with a four-leaf clover, because their lucky asses somehow got featured on national television and sold 1,000 cereal boxes in a day, making $30,000 after expenses. What we can learn from Airbnb & their lovely bunch of cereal boxes? Just because you have a bat shit crazy idea, doesn\u2019t mean you are bat shit crazy, it could mean you are brilliant like Brian and his band of misfits. A good measuring stick here is whether or not your bat shit crazy ideas make money. Often times, there is money to be made outside the products your business is currently offering. If you want to stay relevant in this weird ever-changing world, you can\u2019t offer the same stuff over and over again, even if that stuff is making you money. Stuff to Consider What is a bat shit crazy idea you have been thinking about? Crazy, more times than not, is a synonym for innovative. What are some untapped opportunities in your industry? What are some new products you can create to make money? By Cole Schafer. Cole is the copy chief at Honey Copy , where he helps startups make more money through emails and landing pages that read like poetry and sell like Ogilvy. When he isn\u2019t slinging copy, he is right here on Medium sharing ideas about life, business, marketing and orange juice. Or riding alpacas.

Whether you\u2019re seeking a coffee shop perfect for studying or a sweet treat getaway, Providence cafes offer countless opportunities to indulge. Many of these restaurants are already student favorites, but with winter specials, they\u2019re worth giving another look. Sometimes, a sweet treat or caffeine pick-me-up is needed to get through a long day of studying. If you find yourself searching for one, don\u2019t hesitate to try out one of these places. Dave\u2019s Coffee, popular for its modern decor, available seating and coffee and espresso bar, has now rotated into its winter menu. While their classics \u2014 such as the Classic Breakfast Sandwich and the Avocado Toast \u2014 remain, new items, such as the grab-and-go Winter Soba Noodle Salad, have been added. In the top shelf of their pastry case, Dave\u2019s features a new gingersnap sandwich cookie with orange cream filling as part of the winter menu. Pair it with your morning (or evening) coffee for a motivational treat. Dave\u2019s, located on South Main Street, is open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily.

Stephen Forsey will be the kind of person you want to offer watches, more expensive than the majority of houses in the world. British and French duo Greois Forsey's British team, Stephen is surely an adorable person who seamlessly creates the world's most remarkable watch, from comfortable dialogue to sophisticated mechanics as well as production technology. Although Greubel Forsey exhibited at the renowned SIHH watch trade demonstrate, like other high-end manufacturers such as Richard Mille, Audemars Piguet and Parmigiani, these are very independent in their functions and not part of Richemont, which usually runs SIHH. One of the most extraordinary \" new\" watches on the 2015 brand is that many collectors consider the brand an entirely new perspective. Richard Mille RM 011 Le Mans Classic replica Watch\nOn the face of it, Greubel Forsey Tourbillon 24 Moments Vision is the simplest wrist watch ever designed by the brand. Here is the case for those of us who are knowledgeable about the first statement of the brand, and the watch behaves compared to others over the years. Really ironic is the fact Greubel Forsey did not design and style a more beautiful watch, nevertheless a brand of design implies how to invest in demonstrating it is mechanical invention and perfect the thought of excellence. People are pounding Greubel Forsey products because they are elegant and offer sporting decors and also decals that barely fit. Why suddenly a simple enjoy?\nIn this way, it represents the readiness of the Greubel Forsey extractor. Rarely branded watches fit everyday wear, but the see has a hard-to-reach feel about the wrist. I believe the Greubel Forsey Tourbillon 24 next vision is \" The response to this question if I desire my Greubel Forsey expertise, what can I wear, but in addition something simple? \" Put simply, few people buy Greyweber Forsey customers. luxury replica watches\nGreubel Forsey Tourbillon 24 Secondes Vision Really one of the most cozy Greubel Forsey watches We have ever worn. In 2015, Greubel Forsey Tourbillon all day and Secondes Vision exclusive 18 carat white gold, 43. 5mm large case. It is also 13. 66 mm thick (excluding atmosphere bubbles on the back), significantly thinner than the other Greubel Forsey models. You also have some sort of dial that indicates the particular minutes and minutes in a really traditional way, as well as a great attached second. In fact , as well as the branding, there's something further about the only dial aspect that is the tourbillon window, which can be less noticeable in the previous Greubel Forsey.\nTypically the latter may be the most debatable element of the Vision observe. If you are paying for a Greubel Forsey tourbillon, do not you need to see it as much as you can? Around the tourbillon is a very fine, although wide, bridge. Although you can view the tourbillon below that, it blocks some rayon. Greubel Forsey Tourbillon per day The Secondes Vision Tourbillon has been carefully designed to eliminate the watch if you want to provide the almost all intimate look for the tourbillon, checking for exquisite hand made work from the back of the truth. The back of the sapphire ravenscroft case design has the essential air bubbles to provide room for the tourbillon - in any other case, the case can not be thin. Ulysse Nardin Complications Triple Jack 739-61/E2 replica Watch\nAt the wrist, you truly did not feel the bubble rapid at least I did not. The inside crafted and engineered Greubel Forsey Caliber GF01r hand-wound movement is as beautiful along with desirable as the brand wants, and of course is the original Tourbillon 24 Secondes. Unlike nearly all tourbillons, which are perfectly thready, rotating every 60 seconds, typically the Greubel Forsey Tourbillon twenty four Secondes Vision Tourbillon leans 25 degrees and revolves every 24 seconds, so that it is faster. It is noteworthy that does not affect the accuracy with the watch, the traditional subsidiary mere seconds in the Vision watch switch. The tourbillon is more produced by 86 widgets, along with a titanium case and a platinum counterweight.\nOften the GF01r movement is also a a lot more basic movement made by Greubel Forsey, and the GF01r activity is quite complex even in concluding and decorating. This mobility has a total of 288 parts, a total of seventy two hours power reserve, running moment of 21, 600 bph. In addition to the time on the dial, we have a cautious reserve indicator for the back of the movement. nice Greubel Forsey replica watches\nIn terms of a simple and delicate watch, it will take a lot of effort to get into often the dial. Stephen Forsey clarifies how complicated the call of Greubel Forsey Tourbillon's 24-second visual dial will be, though it looks fairly basic at first. The face itself is 18K yellow metal and gives unique handling to acquire a specific gray color. Dark-colored hour indicator is actually enameled surface. This means they are carefully decorated and baked - plenty of personal steps are required inside the design of the Greubel Forsey Tourbillon 24 second graphic dial. You also have a unique palm - this is the brand newbie - it's a separate hand-polished and flame blue iron.\nOn the hand-sewn black alligator strap, the actual Greubel Forsey Tourbillon twenty-four Secondes Vision is by far by far the most comfortable and arguably essentially the most superior Greubel Forsey.

The hippocampus was fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin, prepared for histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining. The paraffin tissue blocks were prepared for sectioning at 5-\u03bcm thickness by sledge microtome. The obtained tissue sections were stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Immunostaining For the immunohistochemical analysis, paraffin-embedded coronal sections of the hippocampus (6-\u03bcm thickness) were dewaxed in xylol, rehydrated, and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently, the sections were blocked with 3% H 2 O 2 for 20 min. Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling the sections on an electric stove in a citric acid buffer (0.01 mol/L, pH 6.0), followed by incubation with blocking 5% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. After incubated with the NLRP3 primary antibody (Abcam, ab214185; 1:200) overnight at 4\u00b0C, the sections were incubated with 2-step plus\u00aePoly-HRP AntiMouse/Rabbit IgG Detection System (ZSGB-BIO, China) against the primary antibodies. Finally, the sections were developed with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and were counterstained with hematoxylin. For immunofluorescent staining, without blocking endogenous peroxidase, the sections were incubated with the primary antibodies anti-IBA-1 (Abcam, ab15690; 1:200) or anti-LC3 (Cell signaling, 4108; 1:100). After washes, Cy3-Labeled goat anti-Mouse IgG antibodies (Beyotime Biotechnology, China, A0521; 1:1000) or Cy3-Labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Beyotime Biotechnology, China, A0516; 1:1000) were applied for 1 h. The sections were washed with PBS three times and stained with DAPI (Beyotime Biotechnology, China, C1006) to stain the cell nuclei. Immunofluorescent images were taken with an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX53, Olympus, Japan). Statistical analysis Results from the experiment were expressed as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD and analyzed using SPSS version 13.0 software. Normality of distribution was assessed by the Lilliefors test, and homogeneity of variance was tested with the Levene\u2019s test. Differences between groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, followed by Tukey\u2019s test for post hoc comparisons when equal variances were assumed. The prior level of significance was established at p <\u20090.05. Results Behavioral tests Animals exposed to LPS showed significantly less weight gain compared with control group ( p <\u20090.01), and SalB treatment had no effect on body weight changes ( p >\u20090.05) (Fig. 1a ). The LPS-treated rats also exhibited increased immobility time in FST ( p <\u20090.01) (Fig. 1 b) and decreased sucrose preference in SPT ( p <\u20090.01) (Fig. 1c, d ) compared with the control group, whereas the drug use mitigated the depressive-like behaviors in LPS-exposed rats. In line with previous findings [ 14 ], LPS challenge induced an anxiogenic effect as evident by the significant reduction in the open-arm time (Fig. 1e , p <\u20090.01) and number of entries (Fig. 1f , p <\u20090.05) in the open arm, whereas the anxiolytic effect of SalB was also observed. For the control rats, SalB alone had no effect on the behavioral profile ( p >\u20090.05). Fig. 1 SalB alleviates LPS-induced behavioral changes. Effect on SalB and LPS on body weight changes ( a ). Depression-like behaviors was assessed by forced swimming test ( b ) and sucrose preference test ( c , d ). Anxiety-like behaviors was assessed by the elevated plus maze test ( e , f ).

As shown in Fig. 2a , there were no significant neuronal abnormalities in the control and SalB group, while the neurons in the hippocampus of the LPS-treated group showed nuclear condensation and acidophilic degeneration, which were significantly alleviated by SalB co-administration. Likewise, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecular 1 (IBA-1) staining was used for the analysis of microglia activation and our data showed that SalB treatment mitigated LPS-induced microglia activation (Fig. 2a ). In accordance, SalB also alleviated the enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 (Fig. 2b, c ), in LPS group except that both SalB and LPS exerted no effect on TNF-\u03b1 expression (Fig. 2d ).

In accordance with previous findings [ 19 ], the western blot results showed that prolonged LPS exposure impaired autophagy with significant decrease of LC3-II/I ratio (Fig. 3 , p <\u20090.01). To further examine whether the LPS-induced decrease of LC3-II/I ratio is due to impaired autophagosome formation or enhanced autophagic degradation, we blocked the autophagosome-lysome fusion by using the lysosomal inhibitor, CQ, following repeated LPS stimulation. As depicted in Fig. 3 , CQ administration markedly increased the LC3-II/I ratio in both the control and LPS group, and LC3-II/I ratio was higher in the control + CQ group compared with the LPS + CQ group, indicating that sustained LPS treatment impaired autophagy by inhibiting autophagosome formation without affecting autophagic flux. Fig. 3 Representative western blot and quantitative analysis of LC3-II/I ratio in the absence or presence of chloroquine (CQ). Pretreatment with CQ induced an additional increase in the LC3-II/I ratio in both the control and LPS groups. Data are means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD ( n \u2009=\u20096) SalB induced autophagy and attenuated LPS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation SalB was recently proven to contain neuroprotective and autophagic modulating properties. As shown in Fig. 4a , the immunofluorescence analysis showed that LPS decreased LC3 expression, further confirming the inhibitory effect of sustained inflammatory state on autophagosome formation, which was restored by SalB treatment. In addition, our data also showed that although LPS decreased the expression of LC3-II/I ratio ( p <\u20090.01) and Beclin-1 ( p <\u20090.01), SalB facilitated autophagy in the brain of LPS-treated rats (Fig. 4b\u2013d ).

We found that the protein levels of NLRP3 (Fig. 5a, b , p <\u20090.01) and ASC (Fig. 5d , p <\u20090.01) were significantly increased in the hippocampus of the LPS-exposed rats compared with that of the control group. In parallel, LPS treatment also induced significant activation of caspase-1 (cleaved caspase-1 P20) (Fig. 5e , p <\u20090.01) and enhanced the protein expression of both pro-IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 5f , p <\u20090.01) and mature IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 5g , p <\u20090.01), whereas SalB partly normalized the NLRP3 inflammasome activation with significant decrease of the protein levels NLRP3 inflammasome components (NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1 P20) and attenuated IL-1\u03b2 activation compared with the LPS-treated group. These results suggest that autophagy process may interact with NLRP3 inflammasome to promote depression-like behaviors and neuroimmune activation, which may also actively participate in the molecular mechanisms of antidepressant effects of SalB.

Given that autophagy serves as a protective mechanism in unfavorable conditions, such as starvation and inflammation, it is very likely that the interaction between autophagy and neuroimmune system is involved in both onset and treatment of depression. Autophagy limits detrimental and uncontrolled inflammation, through the clearance of inflammasomes and proinflammatory cytokines, thus functioning as a central fulcrum that balances inflammatory responses [ 20 ]. Disruption of autophagy process either by chemical compounds or genetic modulation enhances NLRP3 activation and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon LPS stimulation [ 21 , 22 ]. At the opposite, induction of autophagy by rapamycin leads to the degradation of NLRP3 and reduced amount of IL-1\u03b2 [ 23 ]. To firstly provide the direct evidence linking the interaction between autophagy and neuroimmune system to depression, we assessed the expression of autophagic biomarkers, including LC3-II/I and Beclin-1, in the hippocampus of rats following sustained immune stimuli. As previously reported [ 15 ], prolonged exposure to LPS successfully induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors in rats, which resembles the clinical features that patients with depression are frequently under chronic subclinical inflammatory state. The continuous neuroinflammation also suppressed the expression of autophagic markers, LC3-II/I and Beclin-1. Notably, our data showed that chronically LPS-treated rats displayed unchanged hippocampal TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression, which is contradictory to the previous findings that the LPS-induced activation of toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR4) and NF-\u03baB signaling transcriptionally and translationally promotes TNF-\u03b1 expression [ 24 ]. However, in line with our findings, a recent study found that although the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines are preferentially enhanced in monocytes adapted by lower doses of LPS, the higher doses of LPS suppresses or has no effect on the inflammatory mediators, indicating that excessive or sustained TLR4 activation may result in endotoxin tolerance [ 25 ]. Similarly, this phenomenon was also recently documented in the central nervous system by showing that in spite of the significant increase of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in rat hippocampus following acute LPS administration, 3 months of LPS treatment only increases IL-1\u03b2 protein levels but has no effect on IL-6 and decreases TNF-\u03b1 status, implying that IL-1\u03b2 could be the critical cytokine that accounts for the neruoinflammatory response and depression-like behaviors induced by repeated LPS stimulation [ 19 ]. Inflammasomes are intracellular signaling platforms, detecting a series of substances emerging during infections, cellular damage, or metabolic disturbances and thereby proteolytically activating the highly proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18, whereas autophagy acts as a negative regulator of inflammasomes [ 9 ]. The activation of inflammasomes, especially NLRP3, contributes to the depression-like behaviors in animals caused by either stress or LPS. Genetic knock-out of NLRP3 increases the resilience to stress and blocks LPS-induced inflammatory responses [ 10 , 26 ]. The autophagy protein, P62, can interact with the inflammasome component ASC, redirecting the ASC-containing inflammasome towards autophagosome and eventually delivered to lysosomes for destruction [ 27 ]. Additionally, it has been shown that IL-1\u03b2 is sequestered in the LC3-positive autophagosomes upon TLR stimulation, and pro-IL-1\u03b2 protein levels decreased when autophagy is induced by rapamycin, suggesting that pro-IL-1\u03b2 is also targeted to autophagosome for degradation [ 22 ]. Since the NLRP3 inflammasome is one of the convergent pathways common to depression and autophagy, we further investigated the involvement of NLRP3 in the progression and alleviation of depression. Our data showed that sustained LPS treatment profoundly induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation with increased expression of the key components (NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1 P20), and IL-1\u03b2 activation. TLR activation has been reported to promote both pro-IL-1\u03b2 expression and degradation by autophagy, thus limiting the inflammation reaction due to minor insult [ 22 ]. However, we found that prolonged LPS exposure seems to induce exhaustion of autophagy, resulting in aberrant pro-IL-1\u03b2 production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These data are consistent with previous findings that 0.5 mg/kg LPS treatment for 3 months impairs autophagy in rat brain [ 19 ]. Similarly, Kim and colleagues also found that LPS stimulation suppresses LC3II accumulation and enhances inflammasomes activation in murine peritoneal macrophages [ 28 ]. These contradictory results may be due to the experimental conditions, such as cell types and LPS doses and treatment duration. Considering that the LPS-induced decrease of autophagic markers could be attributed to either the impaired autophagic formation or enhanced autophagosome clearance, we further assessed the effect of LPS stimulation on autophagic flux in the animal brain. The pronouncedly increased LC3-II/I ratio in both control and LPS group following CQ administration suggests that autophagic flux was normal in LPS-treated rats. Likewise, the evidence concerning the impact of LPS on autophagic flux is limited and controversial. Although most of the studies are in support of our findings showing that LPS exposure enhances or has no effect on autophagic flux [ 28 , 29 ], Liu et al. found that LPS treatment suppresses autophagic flux and activates NLRP3 inflammasome in Kupffer cells [ 30 ]. Therefore, it would be interesting for future studies to evaluate the autophagic process in the brain following acute or prolonged challenge of LPS given the essential role of the interaction between autophagy and inflammation in neurological functions. Meanwhile, we also found that SalB facilitated autophagy and attenuated LPS-induced NLRP3 activation. Although the mechanisms are yet not fully understood, autophagy can directly sequester and degrade inflammasome components or indirectly clear endogenous danger signals that induce inflammasome formation, such as reactive oxygen species and DNA. Additionally, it should be noted that SalB can activate nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling and promote the clearance of ROS [ 29 ], which might be also involved in the restoration of NLRP3 overactivation. In line with our findings, a recent research also demonstrated that Beclin-1 is suppressed and mitochondrial autophagy is compromised in learned helplessness depression model, which is alleviated by fluoxetine treatment [ 31 ]. Similarly, a number of antidepressant drugs were recently shown to enhance autophagy in vitro and in vivo [ 32 ]. Lithium, the prototypic mood stabilizer, and other antidepressant strategies, such as electroconvulsive seizures (ECS), also can promote brain autophagy process [ 33 , 34 ]. Additionally, the mTOR inhibitor and classical autophagy inducer, rapamycin, confers antidepressant effects through promoting autophagy [ 7 , 35 ]. Although it has been generally accepted that the induction of autophagy promotes antidepressant actions and some of the antidepressants can induce autophagy beyond their influence on monoaminergic neurotransmission, it should be noted that not all antidepressants may act the same way on autophagy. It was found in a recent study that while amitriptyline and citalopram facilitate autophagic processes in rat primary astrocytes and neurons, venlafaxine fails to affect autophagy [ 36 ]. Intriguingly, desmethylclomipramine blocks autophagic flux in tumor cells, thus potentiating the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents [ 37 , 38 ]. Based on these evidence, it seems likely that autophagy might be involved in the pharmacological actions of some antidepressants and the impact of antidepressants on autophagic process may differ according to the selected drugs and cell types. SalB has been proven to provide anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, and neuroprotective activities. Recently, several lines of evidence suggest that SalB is a novel autophagy inducer, whereby to exert cardio protective and antitumor activities [ 13 , 39 , 40 ]. To explore whether the facilitating effect of SalB on autophagy process is involved in its antidepressant and neuroimmune modulating effects, we assessed the effects of SalB on autophagic biomarkers in the inflamed brain. Our data firstly showed that SalB mitigated the LPS-induced behavioral changes, microglial activation, and inflammatory responses and restored the compromised autophagy process. In support to our data, a recent study showed that SalB effectively ameliorates chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviors and neuroimmune activation [ 14 ]. The interrelationship between autophagy and neuroimmune actions is intricate, and SalB has complex pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities [ 29 ]. It should be noted that although the modulating effect of SalB on autophagy may contribute to the normalization of NLRP3 inflammasome in SalB treatment group, other mechanisms, such as ROS scavenging and direct neuro-immunomodulating activities of SalB, might also be involved in the restoration of NLRP3 overactivation and neuroinflammation. Thus, the potential central role of autophagy in the antidepressant and anti-inflammatory actions of SalB warrants further direct examination. Conclusions The evidence concerning the interrelationship among neuroinflammation, autophagy, and depression is interesting and blank. Collectively, our data firstly provide the evidence showing that the LPS-induced sustained inflammatory state may interact with autophagy process to promote behavioral deficits, whereas SalB enhanced autophagy and induced the clearance of excessive NLRP3, resulting in antidepressant and neuroprotective effects. Although the underlying mechanisms need to be further investigated, our research highlighted the synergism between autophagy and neuroimmune system in the progression and remission of depression and raise the possibility that SalB could be a promising naturally occurring compound in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

While there, I saw world leaders, environmental activists and even a delegation from Brown (which included Professor of Environmental Studies and Sociology J. Timmons Roberts\u2019 Climate and Development Lab) participate in meaningful work advancing solutions to the most pressing problems of climate change. Unfortunately, I also saw firsthand a trend that I fear is becoming all too common: the tendency among American liberals to define all of their actions in relation to President Trump, even at the expense of real progress. Of course, Trump\u2019s presence was always going to be felt at COP23. This June, Trump announced that the United States would exit the Paris Agreement, to the dismay of all level-headed people, including a majority of people in all 50 states. But, since the withdrawal process will take up the remainder of Trump\u2019s term in office, a delegation was shipped out to Bonn last month to, in the words of a State Department press release, \u201censure a level playing field that benefits and protects U.S. interests.\u201d In line with this \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric, the delegation hosted just one public side event at the conference. Its title? \u201cThe Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation.\u201d Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg aptly likened this event to \u201cpromoting tobacco at a cancer summit.\u201d About two-thirds of the event\u2019s attendees, including myself and students from the Climate and Development Lab, interrupted the panel discussion with a song set to the tune of \u201cGod Bless the U.S.A.\u201d and then staged a demonstration outside with many climate justice and indigenous groups. The Trump administration\u2019s foray into the climate world seemed designed expressly to provoke (and even troll), and it was met with a resounding chorus of rejection that significantly increased media coverage of the event. The success of this direct action underscores the importance of activism that is inclusive, urgent and impossible to ignore. Across town, housed in a temporary tent structure that most resembled a tennis court bubble, the U.S. Climate Action Center was staging its own form of rejection \u2014 but their effort fell flat. The center was there to represent not the official U.S. delegation, but the \u201cover 2,500 cities, states and tribes, businesses, academic institutions and faith groups\u201d that have joined a nationwide network called \u201cWe Are Still In\u201d \u2014 that is, still in the Paris Agreement. Across seven days of programming, the U.S. Climate Action Center was determined to drive home one message in addition to their \u201cWe Are Still In\u201d motto: \u201cWe Are Not Trump.\u201d In other words, its climate policy for \u201cThe Resistance,\u201d headlined by political heavyweights like Bloomberg, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and Democratic California Gov. Jerry Brown. Not being Trump is certainly a good start, but inside the literal bubble of the U.S. Climate Action Center, climate change felt less like an existential threat than a playing field on which elites could score political points. Those on the front lines of climate change \u2014 for example, indigenous peoples, subsistence farmers and citizens of small island nations \u2014 were lost on a stage of senators and governors jostling to make the best crack at Trump. The irony was brought into sharp focus when Gov. Brown, interrupted mid-speech by a group of indigenous activists protesting his affinity for fracking, proceeded to make a Trump-style threat to \u201cput (them) in the ground\u201d while still trying to flash his climate credentials. Putting the moral repugnancy of his remark aside, Brown\u2019s defense of California fracking is fundamentally at odds with the Paris Agreement; the oil and gas fields we have already developed are more than enough to push us past the 1.5 degree threshold, even if we never build a new one. The entire incident was reflective of the self-congratulatory, myopic nature of that contradictory political strategy. On climate, as with so many other things, Trump has lowered standards so spectacularly that politicians can become heroes by putting in little more than greenwashing. We need to remember that supporting Paris is a low bar. Former ExxonMobil CEO and current Secretary of State Rex Tillerson does. Literally every other nation in the world does. Moreover, when Trump is framed as the sole villain, it\u2019s all too easy to ignore our own culpability: We are the world\u2019s second-largest emitter and largest historical emitter (by a long shot) for reasons that have nothing to do with him. If we\u2019re going to do anything about them, we need to look beyond solutions that sink to Trump\u2019s level. These are trying times for American democracy, but they are endlessly more trying for those already bearing the brunt of the effects of climate change that the Browns and Bloombergs of the world will never have to face. We need to expect more from our Resistance. One day, (I pray) Trump will be gone, but climate change will still be here, and it still won\u2019t be politically expedient to make the kind of changes we\u2019ll need. The politicization of climate change in American politics may well devastate entire societies and nations \u2014 if it hasn\u2019t already \u2014 not just because of Republican denialism and obstructionism, but also because it has become another way for Democrats to score political points. If I learned one thing at Bonn, it is that real climate action rests on a foundation made up of people, not politics. Clare Steinman \u201919 can be reached at clare_steinman@brown.edu.

As the \u201cBeary\u201d half of the Beary Keys, the Bear Necessities described themselves as \u201cBrown\u2019s only all-male, all-suspendered a cappella group, and we love it.\u201d The Higher Keys call themselves \u201cBrown\u2019s oldest all-gender a cappella group\u201d with a repertoire comprised of jazz, pop and R&B. Indeed, Saturday\u2019s performance demonstrated the fruits of an organic and endearing partnership, as the \u201cBeary Keys\u201d proved to be a conclusively pleasant affair. After a rather uninspired opening, the show found its stride and peaked with a collaborative production of a \u201cGod Rest Ye\u2019 Merry Gentleman\u201d / \u201cCarol of the Bells\u201d medley. The Bear Necessities \u2014 yes, decked out in suspenders \u2014 kicked off the proceedings with an understated performance of \u201cCarry on My Wayward Son.\u201d It was admittedly off-putting to begin what was billed as a holiday show with a minimalist rendition of the Kansas rock classic. The attire didn\u2019t help matters either, as only one member of the group managed to procure a Santa hat. The Higher Keys took the stage next, wearing a simple array of red and black (with one member donning a stray pair of reindeer antlers). The Keys opened with an adaptation of Charlie Brown\u2019s \u201cChristmas Time is Here,\u201d a curious choice given the song\u2019s dreary tone. However, a brief solo scat performance at the end of the song seemed to wake both the show and audience from their stupor. Indeed, the Keys followed with a downright impish rendition of the classic Christmas duet, \u201cBaby It\u2019s Cold Outside.\u201d While not the strongest harmonic performance, \u201cBaby It\u2019s Cold Outside\u201d was refreshingly entertaining, engaging and self-aware in its silliness. The Keys even included a cheeky nod to Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s famous \u201cMack The Knife\u201d gaffe, as they pretended (I think?) to bungle and forget the lyrics to the second half of the song. Taking their cue from the Keys, the Bears returned with a stronger and livelier second act. After an entertaining first tune, they pulled from the more religiously-oriented tradition of Christmas carols, singing a birth of Christ anthem that was immediately the concert\u2019s most harmonically precise and elegant performance. The Keys began their second act with Joni Mitchell\u2019s \u201cRiver.\u201d Keys president Rebecca Cheng \u201918 proved to be a stirring triumph as the solo voice in the a cappella adaptation. Her hauntingly beautiful performance evoked the somber nostalgia that provides the emotional undercurrent to the holiday season. As expected, the \u201cBeary Keys\u201d concluded with a collaboration between the two groups. The aforementioned medley opened subtly before revealing its more energetic character, replete with feet stamping and a beatboxing performance. The Bears and Keys fit neatly together, with alto and soprano voices floating over a baritone foundation that displayed real substance and depth. The medley delighted the audience, providing a rising conclusion to a largely mature and successful concert. I left the auditorium with only one question unanswered \u2014 what took \u201cBeary Keys\u201d so long to get going?

"text": "Cannabis Industry News 3 min read \nThere was a recent report released out of Colorado claiming there was a possibility an infant\u2019s death was attributed to marijuana. We honestly believe it\u2019s important to stop the spread of misinformation. Why even report that something is a possibility without any fact behind it? Because that is what our mainstream media does. They control with fear by focusing mainly on the negative and extreme cases to lead you to believe that is the norm. But alas, we digress and want to tackle this claim head on with some facts . The report was published back in August so why is it being mentioned three months later? We can speculate on how Denver 7 is using their power to scare the masses into disliking marijuana and it\u2019s benefits but then we\u2019d be just like Denver 7. Upon Googling the news station and weed every article that came up had a negative twist to it. When pot became legal they focused on the use in children over the positive use of the tax money on scholarships and community projects . They even say in their own article that it could have been second-hand smoke or from breastfeeding and that the parents admitted to drug usage outside of marijuana. What\u2019s even worse is the article only focuses on the possibility of weed but does not discuss what happened to the parents for their actions. What drugs have already been proven to be tied to myocarditis? Myocraditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle as result of illicit or medical drug use. There is a specific study on an older woman who died of toxic drug-induced myocarditis found that any drug used in medical practice can cause this. All the drugs that have been proven to cause this are listed below, notice alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines. Alcohol, cocaine and amphetamines all leave your body within four days. \nIn a day where there is constant fake news, it\u2019s important we find ways to keep the facts straight. Marijuana is only one of the many benefits of the hemp plant. We\u2019re fighting not only big pharma but the logging industry, cotton, liquor, tobacco and more. The fact that an infant dies and parents admit to drug usage outside of marijuana, but the doctors don\u2019t consider that factor in their report is as concerning as news stations reporting on something without it being fully researched. \nHow come no one reported on the other drugs the parents used? How come no one thinks about how long weed stays in the system despite your usage? These are important questions to ask when you\u2019re tuning into cannabis content being shared by traditional media outlets.

Jerusalem capital of Israel Trump proclaims Jerusalem capital of Israel US President Donald Trump, recognizes Jerusalem \nNEW YORK \u2013 United States President Donald Trump has proclaimed that his country would recognise Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel. \nTrump, while making the announcement at a ceremony at the White House, said his decision marked \u201cthe beginning of a new approach to conflict between Israel and the Palestinians\u201d. \nHe recalled that in 1995, Congress adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act, urging \u201cthe federal government to relocate the American embassy to Jerusalem and to recognise that city \u2013 and so importantly \u2013 is Israel\u2019s capital\u201d. \n\u201cThis act passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago,\u201d he said. \n\u201cPresidents issued these waivers under the belief that delaying the recognition of Jerusalem would advance the cause of peace. \n\u201cSome say they lacked courage, but they made their best judgments based on facts as they understood them at the time. Nevertheless, the record is in. \n\u201cAfter more than two decades of waivers, we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. \n\u201cIt would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result. \n\u201cTherefore, I have determined that it is time to officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,\u201d he said \nHe regretted that for over 20 years, every previous American president had exercised the law\u2019s waiver, refusing to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem or to recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital city. \nTrump berated previous presidents who had made recognising Jerusalem as Israeli capital a major campaign promise but failed to deliver declaring: \u201cToday, I am delivering\u201d. \nHe directed the State Department to begin preparation to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \n\u201cThis will immediately begin the process of hiring architects, engineers, and planners, so that a new embassy, when completed, will be a magnificent tribute to peace,\u201d he said. \nAccording to him, however, the decision is not intended, in any way, to reflect a departure from \u201cour strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement\u201d. \nTrump pledged that the U.S. remained deeply committed to helping facilitate a peace agreement that is acceptable to both sides adding, \u201cI intend to do everything in my power to help forge such an agreement\u201d.

Ashaba and Gerald Bareebe On 27 October, a dramatic sweep saw a number of senior Ugandan police officers arrested on suspicion of being part of a Rwandan sleeper cell. The Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence picked up at least seven suspects alleged to have colluded with Kigali to forcibly repatriate a Rwandan refugee four years ago. In 2013, there had been questions over how Lt. Joel Mutabazi, a former presidential bodyguard, had been returned to Rwanda where he was later given a life sentence for treason and terrorism. Allegations swirled over whether Ugandan security agents had been involved. However, little action was taken until this October when numerous officers were detained . These arrests raise a host of questions, not just around the curious case but also its wider implications and the timing. Uganda and Rwanda\u2019s relations have been outwardly fairly warm in recent years. This incident threatens to undermine them, or perhaps it signals that they are already under greater strain than previously recognised. Frenemies for Life Historically, the relationship between Uganda\u2019s President Yoweri Museveni and Rwanda\u2019s President Paul Kagame has gone through several highs and lows. In the 1980s, the two were brothers-in-arms in the rebel National Resistance Army (NRA) that brought Museveni to power in 1986. In the early-1990s, the Ugandan president supported Kagame in taking power in Rwanda. But this alliance was threatened during the Second Congo War (1998-2003) when the two countries backed opposing rebel groups. The two armies engaged in deadly clashes and tensions threatened to spill over into war. Over time, however, the two nations gradually reconciled. This was partly thanks to the diplomatic efforts of Richard Kabonero, who was appointed as Uganda\u2019s ambassador to Rwanda in 2006. Following his arrival in Kigali, Kabonero quickly emerged as a smooth operator with an affinity for organising social events. He was reportedly well-liked by Rwanda\u2019s intelligence community and political elites. By 2011, the relationship had rediscovered its closeness, which was put on public display when Museveni donated $200,000 to a school project in Rwanda. Kagame then visited Uganda as the two leaders gifted each other cattle. In 2012, Museveni awarded Kagame three of Uganda\u2019s top national honours. Fraying Relations More recently, however, this warmth seems to have dissipated. On various fronts, tensions have arisen between the two countries. Regarding Burundi\u2019s ongoing crisis, for example, the neighbours have been running in different directions. It is widely believed that Kigali favours regime change, with Rwanda being accused of arming and supporting Burundian rebels. They deny these allegations. By contrast, Kampala has stood firmly by the Burundian government, with Museveni extending a hand to President Pierre Nkurunziza. There have also been numerous disputes regarding regional integration and cooperation. Uganda has shifted some of its regional infrastructure priorities towards South Sudan at the expense of Rwanda. It has also been perceived to snub a frustrated Kigali on several occasions, such as over its failure to construct an electricity transmission line to its southern border despite Rwanda committing to the project. Internally meanwhile, Uganda has conducted numerous reshuffles that have reportedly elevated figures sceptical of Rwanda. Particularly in security and intelligence agencies, individuals thought to be sympathetic to Rwanda have been retired or transferred, while more hostile officials have been promoted. This May, Ambassador Kabonera was transferred from Rwanda to Tanzania. Rumour Mill According to some observers, it is not surprising that Uganda\u2019s new security heads have been taking action against alleged Rwandan agents. It is also notable that two of the senior officers apprehended, Nixon Agasirwe and Joel Aguma, are widely seen as close associates of Uganda\u2019s police chief, Kale Kayihura. Kagame is a close friend of Kayihura and was the best man on his wedding day. In security circles, many believe that Kigali wants Kayihura to one day take over as president. The widespread rumour prompted Rwanda\u2019s ambassador to deny it had any interest or role in Uganda\u2019s succession this October when rumours of tensions were already afoot. The arrest of the alleged Rwandan spies by Uganda has sparked off a media frenzy, largely driven by Uganda\u2019s tabloid media. On 21 November, the police counter-terrorism unit raided the offices of Red Pepper and arrested eight of its senior managers and editors. The previous day, the newspaper had published a front-page story alleging Museveni was plotting to overthrow Kagame. Despite suggestions they would be charged with treason, the defendants were charged with offences related to libel, endangering national security and disturbing the peace and privacy of President Museveni, his brother Gen. Salim Saleh and Security Minister Tumukunde. On 2 December, a report in The Standard alleged that Uganda\u2019s intelligence services are actively overseeing a recruitment drive by a Rwandan rebel group which seeks to destabilise Kigali. A Sign of Times The Ugandan government has attempted to play down the October arrests of the police officers and their effect on its relationship with Kigali. \u201cWe are just clearing up our house, which is in line with the expectations of the Rwandese government,\u201d said Uganda\u2019s Foreign Minister Henry Oryem Okello. His colleague Patrick Mugoya, the Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary, later reasserted: \u201cThe Ministry dismisses, with contempt, allegations carried by any media publications or platforms to the effect that relations between Rwanda and Uganda are anything but strong and cordial.\u201d But despite this assurance, analysts point out that accusing a neighbouring government of conducting illegal actions on one\u2019s territory is no small matter. Moreover, reports and incidents since October have added to a sense of alarm. It is possible that the recent events relate most directly to the issue of Rwandan exiles. Uganda is currently basking in the glory of international reports praising it as \u201cthe world\u2019s best place for refugees\u201d and is reluctant to deport granted asylum seekers. Meanwhile, Rwanda sees its exiles across the border as a security threat. (In 2009, the two countries\u2019 foreign ministers signed an extradition treaty that was ratified in Rwanda, but still languishes in Uganda.) However, many insiders and observers say that there is a deeper dynamic at work. After a few years of seemingly positive relations, the arrests may be a sign that relations between the old brothers-in-arms are fraying once more.

The Herald\u2019s spring 2016 poll found that those who attend arts events most frequently tend to be non-first-generation students and mostly white students. \u201cI think that a lot more needs to be done by way of outreach or inclusion,\u201d said Zach Silberberg \u201918, a member of IMPROVidence, an improvisational comedy group, and a Herald illustrator. According to poll results, 11.5 percent of first-generation students have never been to an arts event, compared to 7.3 percent of non-first-generation students. About half of white students attend arts events at least once a month, whereas about 40 percent of students of color attend with the same frequency. More and more, cost and accessibility has become less of an issue, said Yolanda Rome, associate dean for first-year and sophomore studies. Many arts organizations have made a concerted effort to eliminate these boundaries. \u201cWe\u2019ve found ways to get tickets to low-income and first-gen students,\u201d said Patricia Ybarra, chair of theatre arts and performance studies. Production Workshop and Musical Forum do not charge for performances, and Sock and Buskin has launched initiatives to get tickets to first-generation students. Part of the discrepancy could have to do with the fact that much of the appeal of arts events is attending with friends, Rome said. Often, first-generation students tend to \u201cseek each other out, so they can understand and talk about their experience with other people who share their perspective,\u201d she added. When first-generation students do not see their friends attending arts events, they might not go either. Valentin Perez \u201918 speculated that the disparity had to do with the way the materials were advertised or worded. \u201cMaking sure that the people represented in the pictures are diverse, from different races and socioeconomic classes \u2014 it lets them know that it\u2019s something that people like them (would want to) go to,\u201d he said. Still, while 10 percent of white students reported attending arts events once a week, only 5 percent of students of color reported attending arts events as often. In light of this discrepancy, some groups have made strides to increase diversity within their groups. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of our group right now because in regards to gender and to race, over the last two years we have brought in amazingly talented and funny people that are not just white men, and this is reflected in the audience,\u201d Silberberg said. Benjamin Hayslett-Ubell \u201918.5, a member of Out of Bounds Sketch Comedy, echoed this sentiment. \u201cNow there is a more conscious effort to make the space more inclusive,\u201d he said. In March, The Herald wrote about how those from diverse backgrounds navigate the comedy space at Brown. \u201cThe sorts of conversations about how gender and race and class have influence even on a group of friends are conversations happening,\u201d Hayslett-Ubell said. \u201cThey\u2019re really hard sometimes, but these conversations must take place.\u201d Hayslett-Ubell and Silberberg noted that often those attending events reflect the demographics of the performers. \u201cWe\u2019re inviting the people in our friend groups,\u201d Silberberg said. \u201cAnd when there are these same circles, it\u2019s going to end up being the same people.\u201d In the same vein, Silberberg said: \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a lot of the same people going to the same events. This is something that can and should change. \u2026 We publicize events on Facebook, (and use) posters \u2014 but for the most part, this needs to be better.\u201d The content of arts events might also shape their audiences. \u201cA variety of topics would be interesting \u00ad\u2014 beyond the usual Broadway, Eurocentric topics,\u201d said Samanee Mahbub \u201919. For many arts groups, creating a platform for people of color has become an important goal, Ybarra said. By diversifying content, arts groups have attempted to make their events more visibly accessible. \u201cLast year, we produced a number of shows written by playwrights of color (and) often directed by directors of color. One of the reasons people go to arts events is to see their stories on stage and commitment to telling stories from a diversity of perspectives diversifies your audience,\u201d Ybarra added. Last year\u2019s production of \u201cIn the Heights\u201d drew in an overwhelming response from the Latinx community and beyond, she noted. The sold-out show stands as a testament to the progress in diversifying the arts across campus, she said. \u201cEven if the arts community and the comedy scene is diversifying naturally, there always needs to be a conscious effort to say that this should not just be a space for white people,\u201d Silberberg said.

Laura Felenstein / Herald Interfaith dinners hosted by the Office of the Chaplains play a part in this. Tuesday night, several religious groups on campus got together for interfaith dinner on the fourth floor of J. Walter Wilson to discuss social justice, their religious lives and where they intersect. While this was only the second interfaith dinner of the semester, Rabbi Michelle Dardashti hopes it will lead to the \u201cresurrection of an interfaith council.\u201d More than 20 students representing Judaism, Islam, Baha\u2019i and different denominations of Christianity showed up to the event to share their ideas on social justice. The atmosphere was casual, and Meaghan O\u2019Brien Crayne, Catholic campus minister, even brought her dog Artemis, who was running around and greeting students with a wagging tail. After some eating and introductions, an \u201copen space activity\u201d began that Dardashti explained was a place for voicing questions and issues that would become discussions. Students were welcome to write a topic on a piece of paper that would act as a conversation starter. Topics included environmental justice, intersection of racial justice and faith-based activism and mental health and faith. Dardashti told students to \u201cvote with your feet\u201d and move in and out of groups based on interest, knowledge and experience with each topic. Junaid Malik \u201920, one of the directors of Building Relationships: Islam and Judaism, a program that brings together Muslim and Jewish fifth-graders from Rhode Island, was a part of the \u201cIntersection of Racial Justice and Faith Based Activism\u201d discussion. The group conversed about the racialization of faith and the role religion plays in encouraging the faithful to participate in racial justice. Malik, who is Muslim, brought up the issue of the racialization of Islam. On campus, people explicitly \u201csay things about Islam or Muslims that I find overly generalizes \u2026 the experience of Muslims,\u201d Malik told The Herald. Malik believes there \u201cneeds to be a great focus on creating areas and spaces where people are able to voice their questions.\u201d \u201cIf you have questions about Islam, there are Muslims here,\u201d Malik said. \u201cWe want you to ask questions!\u201d The group reconvened as a whole to debrief their ideas, get contact information and make plans for initiatives in the future. Everyone in the group had to name a \u201cone-on-one\u201d they were going to have with a person of another faith. Besides further interfaith social justice dinners, Hillel has interfaith Shabbats and many religious events on campus welcome students of other religions or no religion. When the dinner was over, O\u2019Brien Crayne explained that all the chaplains get together for weekly interfaith staff meetings. \u201cI mentioned at those meetings that we do a weekly Catholic social justice dinner. \u2026 Rabbi Michelle (said), \u2018That sounds amazing, why don\u2019t we do things together? Why don\u2019t we talk about that together?\u2019\u201d O\u2019Brien Crayne said. \u201cSo that was the initial birth of the collaboration.\u201d Janelle Wheeler \u201918, the Catholic social justice coordinator, attended both interfaith dinners. Wheeler has been involved in her faith since before coming to Brown, saying that her mom is deeply involved in the \u201csocial justice aspect\u201d of Catholicism. When talking about religion with people outside of faith groups, Wheeler said she assumes \u201csecular, unless proven otherwise.\u201d If someone\u2019s religion comes up in conversation, Wheeler said people tend to say, \u201cYou\u2019re religious? That\u2019s cool. I want to find out about it.\u201d And Brown has a vibrant religious life despite its secular stereotype, she said. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t a part of those (religious or spiritual) communities, you don\u2019t necessarily see that.\u201d Wheeler said. Michelle Miller \u201918, a convert to Islam and a member of the Muslim Student Association, attended the first interfaith dinner. She told The Herald that she has faced misconceptions about her religion at home and on campus. Miller said she has received \u201cweird looks\u201d and has been asked, \u201cWhy would you choose that for yourself\u201d in regards to her choice to convert. Miller has a particular interest in the relationship between faith and mental health and hopes people know Islam is \u201ctruly a religion of equality.\u201d These misconceptions may exist because of ignorance of her religion. Even on campus, MSA and Muslim life is relatively unknown. Though MSA is located in the basement of Morris and Champlin Hall, Miller said, \u201cI would hope that people know about it, I would hope that they know it\u2019s out there. It\u2019s open to anyone that comes.\u201d Though Reverend Janet Cooper Nelson could not attend the dinner, she said she feels that religion can sometimes be an uncomfortable or uneducated discussion to have on campus. \u201cThe least educated conversation that\u2019s happening at Brown is the conversation about religion,\u201d Cooper Nelson said. Ilana Brandes-Krug \u201920, BRIJ co-director and a part of the 2017 Learning Chair for Brown-RISD Hillel, agreed. \u201cOverall, my impression is that the Brown campus is not comfortable talking about religion,\u201d she wrote in an email to The Herald. \u201cTension surrounding discussions of religion even persist between different faith groups. The mission of BRIJ is to create dialogue about how our traditions inspire us to stand together and work for local change in our communities.\u201d Maria Ronchi \u201919 and Jenna Tishler \u201920, co-leaders of the Campus Unitarian Universalist Group, could not attend the interfaith dinner Tuesday, but both expressed a desire for more interfaith events. With a core group of six members, Ronchi and Tishler feel their group doesn\u2019t always have the power to organize those events and can sometimes go unnoticed. On campus, Ronchi sometimes gets responses such as, \u201cHow is it even a religion?\u201d or \u201cEw, spirituality, I wouldn\u2019t go to that\u201d when she talks about her religion, she said. Tishler agrees that there is a hesitance to UU, but not necessarily an animosity among Brown students. Laughing a bit, Tischler said, \u201cThey like us because they use our church for graduation.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marianna mcmurdock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michelle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o\u2019brien crayne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cooper nelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michelle miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dardashti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tishler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. walter wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wheeler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "junaid malik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meaghan o\u2019brien crayne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilana brandes-krug", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tischler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brij", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronchi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michelle dardashti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria ronchi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenna tishler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura felenstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet cooper nelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janelle wheeler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "herald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judaism", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office of the chaplains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "campus unitarian universalist group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brij", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "herald interfaith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim student association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rhode island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "champlin hall", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:37.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "482232032ce82686172e285eb06b7e64f8b27bdd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KvwQYjvte6ZRse7e.oI44USRpLgdsTa9fNIhEvY_4r1QZRG7j03VunIOk4gz8w.bev9NdKMc7KJehlVIfinRQI02bZ80yE3U-", "site_full": "www.browndailyherald.com", "site": "browndailyherald.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tennis", "mens_health", "health", "sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Pichardo \u201920: Do you know where the homeless people are?", "title_full": "Pichardo \u201920: Do you know where the homeless people are?", "published": "2017-12-07T07:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.17, "main_image": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/wp-content/themes/browndailyherald/images/facebook-default.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "482232032ce82686172e285eb06b7e64f8b27bdd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KvwQYjvte6ZRse7e.oI44USRpLgdsTa9fNIhEvY_4r1QZRG7j03VunIOk4gz8w.bev9NdKMc7KJehlVIfinRQI02bZ80yE3U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mariela Pichardo", "published": "2017-12-07T07:12:00.000+02:00", "title": "Pichardo \u201920: Do you know where the homeless people are?", "text": "Op-Ed Contributor Thursday, December 7, 2017 Last week, the streets of Providence were especially empty. As I walked through Downcity Providence and up Broad Street, I could feel the absence of the city\u2019s most vulnerable, who usually sleep near the river downtown, line the entrance of Crossroads Rhode Island, a large Providence shelter, and congregate at bus stops on the South Side. Over the past year, I\u2019ve been working as an outreach worker with the Rhode Island Homeless Advocacy Project, an organization of formerly homeless people that seeks to build relationships with people currently experiencing homelessness and connect them with resources. During my time with RIHAP, I\u2019ve come to look forward to my interactions with the homeless and on quiet nights like this most recent one, I always hope that the absence of familiar faces on the streets means that more folks have been housed. However, while I\u2019d like to be optimistic, I know better than to believe this. Many in the homeless community are likely sleeping on the floors of overflow shelters that require them to leave before sunrise. Others very likely have journeyed out of the city to other parts of the state or even the country; a few individuals I\u2019ve met before have done so in hopes of finding relief elsewhere. More still, I suspect, have been actively pushed outside of their usual dwellings by law enforcement, as has been occurring in downtown Providence for the past few years. This movement of people experiencing homelessness is not occurring on its own; the homeless don\u2019t always leave public spaces of their own accord. Stakeholders with influence at both the local and state level are taking deliberate steps to remove the homeless from public view. It is vital that people are aware of when the homeless community is both present in and absent from society. Over the course of the nearly two hours I was on outreach Thursday night, my team came across only five people, a record low for me. I was introduced to outreach last September through Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere , a student group I now co-lead that aims to end homelessness in Rhode Island. We have over 75 students doing nighttime outreach in downtown Providence, South Side and Pawtucket six nights a week. This week, the teams responsible for outreach in Downtown and South Side, which often see a steady number of people, were all asking themselves the same question: Where have all the homeless folks gone? At this time, we can only speculate as to whether or not these low numbers are here to stay, but in my experience, efforts to transform the area surrounding Kennedy Plaza and Burnside Park into lively hubs for commerce have meant increased policing and the criminalization of homelessness, particularly in down town Providence.http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170616/enforcement-of-downtown-smoking-ban-will-take-time-and-signage This past summer, the Providence City Council \u2014 in conjunction with the former mayor of Providence and owner of Paolino Properties, Joe Paolino \u2014 tried to tackle the \u201chomeless issue\u201d by banning smoking in Kennedy Plaza. According to WPRI 12 Eyewitness News, Paolino, who has business interests downtown, was strongly in favor of the ban on smoking and said it was about \u201cfairness.\u201d In 2015, a similar ordinance was implemented, banning smoking in all city parks , including Burnside Park, which sits beside Kennedy Plaza. (Homeless advocates say the smoking ban in Burnside Park drove the homeless from the park and into Kennedy Plaza.) While promoted as a public health measure, the smoking ban actually functions as a way to encourage or \u201cforce\u201d the homeless presence out of Kennedy Plaza and into less visible parts of the city, such as Broad Street in South Providence. When the ordinance was sent to Mayor Jorge Elorza earlier this year for approval, he vetoed it, writing in his veto message that though this \u201cordinance is ostensibly about smoking, its true target is the homeless community.\u201d In an 11-2 vote, the council passed the ordinance, overriding his veto. Last year while on outreach, my team came across a group of about four police officers that had stopped some folks along the Providence River. We stayed in the area in case they were homeless and being harassed, and approached the officers when the interaction had finished. While the folks they approached hadn\u2019t been homeless, we learned that the officers were not from Providence, but rather from neighboring cities in Rhode Island, which certainly can affect the dynamics between those policing and those being policed. The lead officer that night, though informed of our work, said as we departed, \u201cNo one wants to see the homeless downtown \u2026 no offense.\u201d Frankly, the homeless don\u2019t want to be out there either; the list of Rhode Islanders awaiting housing is growing . For the many who have waited years to receive housing vouchers from local agencies, the wait continues as they and their case workers attempt to find a landlord willing to accept them as tenants. For many landlords, agreeing to house homeless individuals may seem risky, due to their financial insecurity and negative stereotypes surrounding homelessness, such as the idea that all homeless people suffer from addiction. Therefore, despite the vouchers (and at times because of them), landlords sometimes discriminate against the homeless. And this housing discrimination makes it vastly harder for them to get off the streets. It is our responsibility as members of the Rhode Island community to pay attention to and resist the deliberate push of homeless folks out of visible spaces and into marginalized communities. The homeless deserve to be seen and to occupy public spaces as they see fit. Their visibility mustn\u2019t be denied because it makes other people uncomfortable.

As it was the best laid plans didn\u2019t quite work out, that being said this book is a great read for this time of the year with the dark nights, in fact if you enjoy horror I\u2019m pretty certain you can be chilled by this book on any given month of the year. In fact if you\u2019re easily scared you might prefer the lighter nights. \nHorror is one of those cateogories of reads that can go horribly wrong for me. I don\u2019t want too much blood and viscera, bodies being torn to pieces or other atrocities. I want to be scared and also surprised and Kill Creek managed to fulfil all those criteria for me and on top of that provided a downright bone chilling ghost story, the sort where you want to hide behind a cushion \u2013 although can anybody explain why or how that really helps. \nWe start off with an introduction to our main character Sam McGarver. Sam is an author of horror books. He seems to be having something of a blip in his writing and is currently lecturing whilst trying to give off the impression that he\u2019s in the process of drawing up his next novel. Sam receives a mysterious invitation to take part in an interview on the creepiest night of the year, Halloween. The interview will take place in one of the most notoriously haunted houses in the country and unbeknownst to Sam, three other horror writers have been invited to take part. Basically this is a publicity stunt dreamt up by Justin Wainwright, the man behind a website known as WrightWire. Wainwright is hellbent on stirring up a frenzy of visitors to his website and has concocted the idea of an interview with four famous horror writers, in a haunted house \u2013 who knows what will happen! \nWhat worked really well for me in this story were a number of things. \nFirstly the characters. We have four very different authors and their own egos and feelings of insecurity. They come together in a way that creates a wonderful feeling of uncertainty and just plain old paranoia. Thomas does a great job of giving them all individual personalities and bringing them to life quite vividly. There\u2019s also Wainwright. Ruthlessly calculating, he\u2019s hoping for a showdown and comes across as arrogant and self serving. Then we have the final character of the piece. The house. This place has a terrible history. It lies derelict, off the beaten track in the Kansas countryside. For years people have been too scared to approach apart from the odd child on a dare and now it is almost forgotten. \nSecondly the tempo of the book. It\u2019s relentless and perfectly pitched. We have an almost old fashioned feel start, a brief introduction to each of the characters before they come together for the evening almost in the fashion of Then There Were None. Each of them seems to be harbouring some personal issue or fear that helps to crank up the tension. At first, as a reader you\u2019re just plain old worried about the house and what it\u2019s going to throw at you but Thomas seems to lull you into this sense of security, a warm fire, good food and drink, cosy lighting. You forget to be afraid. The interview takes place and everyone goes to bed. I don\u2019t want go into the other issues but the book takes an unexpected turn after this point and it\u2019s anything but cosy. \nFinally the style, I love the way the book develops from an almost classic horror that taps into your psyche to something that becomes almost predictably and comfortingly haunting but then swiftly moves down the path of out and out twisted horror. It\u2019s gripping stuff and the writing is good, it just keeps you completely until the very last chapter. \nI definitely have no hesitation in recommending this book.

Despite the development of new treatment options in the past decades, IFI remains a concern due to substantial morbidity and mortality in these patient populations. In addition, the increasing use of new immune modulating drugs in cancer therapy has opened an entirely new spectrum of at risk periods. Since the last edition of antifungal prophylaxis recommendations of the German Society for Haematology and Medical Oncology in 2014, seven clinical trials regarding antifungal prophylaxis in patients with haematological malignancies have been published, comprising 1227 patients. This update assesses the impact of this additional evidence and effective revisions. Our key recommendations are the following: prophylaxis should be performed with posaconazole delayed release tablets during remission induction chemotherapy for AML and MDS (AI). Posaconazole iv can be used when the oral route is contraindicated or not feasible. Intravenous liposomal amphotericin B did not significantly decrease IFI rates in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients during induction chemotherapy, and there is poor evidence to recommend it for prophylaxis in these patients (CI). Despite substantial risk of IFI, we cannot provide a stronger recommendation for these patients. There is poor evidence regarding voriconazole prophylaxis in patients with neutropenia (CII). Therapeutic drug monitoring TDM should be performed within 2 to 5 days of initiating voriconazole prophylaxis and should be repeated in case of suspicious adverse events or of dose changes of interacting drugs (BIItu). General TDM during posaconazole prophylaxis is not recommended (CIItu), but may be helpful in cases of clinical failure such as breakthrough IFI for verification of compliance or absorption.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2iybn1S", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "medical oncology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "infectious diseases working party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aml", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "german society for haematology and medical oncology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hsct", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ifi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:38.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "415d19414bf55d8dc413db820a8ca22e0fbfc941", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm2mGK4AQXsRemlokPr4dnTT", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=tax cuts", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "tax%20cuts News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "Murray Energy CEO says GOP tax policy will cost him $60 million a year", "title_full": "Murray Energy CEO says GOP tax policy will cost him $60 million a year : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-12-04T21:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "415d19414bf55d8dc413db820a8ca22e0fbfc941", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm2mGK4AQXsRemlokPr4dnTT", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CNBC", "published": "2017-12-04T21:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "Murray Energy CEO says GOP tax policy will cost him $60 million a year", "text": "The Senate's tax overhaul bill is a \"huge tax increase\" on certain businesses, said Robert Murray, chairman and CEO of coal giant Murray Energy.

Small actions like these might help explain why many students find themselves friends with people mostly from their socioeconomic background. Of 854 students polled by The Herald\u2019s fall poll, four in ten said most or a majority of their friends were of the same socioeconomic background as they were. Results varied significantly by respondents\u2019 financial aid status. Of students who receive grants covering all costs, 25 percent said \u201cvery few\u201d of their friends were of the same socioeconomic background, whereas only one in 20 students receiving no financial aid reported this. Responses also varied significantly by the race of respondents, with black and Hispanic students less likely to have a majority of friends from the same socioeconomic background. Black students were the least likely to report that they had most or a majority of friends from their same socioeconomic class, with three in 10 reporting this. Comparatively, about half of Asian students, and four in 10 white and Hispanic students shared this experience. Half of students identifying as American Indian or Alaska Native and 40 percent of Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander students reported having a majority or most friends of the same socioeconomic background, but this was out of a sample of 10 and five respondents, respectively. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of research in social psychology that shows that people prefer to hang out with people who they perceive as similar to them,\u201d said Gregory Elliot, professor of sociology. \u201cWhile it has short-term benefits, in that it can be comfortable in the moment, it also has long-term costs \u2014 where huge chasms develop between groups and nobody feels like reaching out to the other side.\u201d The University has taken steps to increase diversity, notably with its Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan launched in January 2016. Though the recently admitted class of 2021 is considered the University\u2019s most diverse class \u2014 40 percent of the class identifies as students of color, 43 percent receive need-based aid and 26 percent have no expected parental contribution \u2014 factors like race and socioeconomic background continue to influence friend group disparities on campus. \u201cI think diversity is harder to achieve than people think it is,\u201d Chaplain of the University Janet Cooper Nelson said. \u201cWhen people are truly different than we are, it\u2019s not always easy to know them and not easy for them to know us.\u201d For many first-generation and low-income identifying students, joining a predominantly white and wealthy university can be difficult. More University students come from the top 1 percent than the bottom 60 percent of the income bracket, according to a study reported by the New York Times . First-generation and low-income students like Downie often feel the need to find people who can understand their experience at the University \u2014 having to stay on campus for Spring Break or worrying about paying for textbooks. \u201cFor me, with all these financial challenges, it\u2019s been helpful to have people who understand what I\u2019m going through,\u201d Downie said. She points to racial and class-based educational segregation as strongly influencing not only who gets to come to Brown, but also who students socialize with when they are here. Another contributing factor is that students who come from elite circles may carry over those relationships when they arrive on campus, said Michael Shorris \u201919. \u201cThe networks people come from are intentionally structured so that people of a certain background hang out only with people from that same background,\u201d Shorris said. \u201cYou go to the same beach club, same country club, same program abroad \u2026 and namely go to the same schools that are very much exclusionary and then end up at an Ivy League school like Brown.\u201d Abby Levy-Westhead \u201919 said she came to the University with several friends from her private high school in New York City, which formed the basis of her initial friend group. Although Levy-Westhead said her friend group has since expanded, she acknowledged that socioeconomic background can play a factor in what organizations students choose to be a part of, such as her work for the business team of the Ivy Film Festival. \u201cOften times, the students most interested in that come from backgrounds where raising money for arts is important. That tends to be more of an upper class background,\u201d Levy-Westhead said. \u201cThe organizations that I found tend to be in my socioeconomic background.\u201d While developing affinity communities for marginalized groups of students is important, students from more privileged backgrounds should be more conscious about who they become friends with, said Justin Willis \u201918. \u201cIt\u2019s important to interrogate who you become friends with and why,\u201d Willis said. \u201cStudents might ask: \u2018Why is my friend group all white? Why are there no people of color in this friend group?\u2019 At the same time, I don\u2019t think friend groups should play a game of affirmative action.\u201d Peter Simpson \u201920, who is a Minority Peer Counselor from a predominantly Latinx high school of immigrant students in Brooklyn, arrived at the University consciously seeking to develop a diverse friend group. One of his high school teachers advised him to make sure he branched out, he said, and he took the advice to heart. \u201cShe was like, \u2018What\u2019s the point of only making a ton of black friends?\u2019\u201d said Simpson, the son of Jamaican immigrants. \u201cWhich is just to say that there are multiple places on this campus and life in general where you\u2019ll find great people who don\u2019t have the same skin tone as you. I think she meant, \u2018Don\u2019t sell yourself short by thinking that people who don\u2019t have the same skin tone as you can\u2019t offer great friendship.\u2019\u201d On an institutional level, Associate Dean for First-Year and Sophomore Studies Yolanda Rome said that continuing to invest in identity centers for students, such as the recently launched First-Generation College and Low-Income Student Center, helps foster more integration in student groups. \u201cThe centers are making an effort to bring others into their spaces,\u201d Rome said. Ally training workshops for groups ranging from the LGBTQ+ community to undocumented students may help other students understand their position of power in relation to the historically marginalized people represented by these centers, she said. The University has recently increased funding for all of its diversity centers, she added. According to Cooper Nelson, students can be uncertain of how to enter into conversations with others who have differing identities, perhaps fearing potential backlash. \u201cI think at the moment, friendship, university work, interactions can feel full of landmines to students, as though at any moment something will blow up on them,\u201d Cooper Nelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get the courage or patience to wade into conversations where the person on other side doesn\u2019t think the way you think.\u201d To develop a space that allows these conversations to take place, Cooper Nelson encourages embracing diversity not only in the content of ideas professed within the classroom, but also in the pedagogy of how these ideas are taught by creating a classroom where students of all backgrounds feel comfortable engaging in difficult topics like race or class differences. Stratified friend groups are not necessarily indicative of a lack of interaction between students of different backgrounds on campus, said Assistant Professor of History and Religion Andre Willis. When students socialize, they want to be comfortable where their culture is most easily \u201ctranslatable,\u201d he added.
