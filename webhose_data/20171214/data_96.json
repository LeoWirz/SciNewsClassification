And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? \u2013 Malachi 1:6\n\nRead: Malachi 1:6-8 (KJV)\n\n6 A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?\n\n7 Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.\n\n8 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.\n\nBible in One Year: Psalm 113-118, Zephaniah 1, Hymn: Sing Hymn 9 \u2013 On The Hill Far Away\n\nMESSAGE:\n\nFor your prayer to be a sweet savour before the Almighty God, you must be prepared not only to praise Him but also to honour His Name. You cannot truly claim to belong to God without reverencing or honouring His Name. This is why the Lord posed this crucial question to us in Malachi 1:6:\n\n\u201cA son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?\u201d\n\nIf you look at the two types of relationships referenced in the above Scripture passage, you will agree with me that the lower member of each relationship owes a type of honour to the higher member. A son owes his father a higher degree of honour and respect borne out of love. Also, a servant owes his master some degree of fear, honour and regard, as the master is the source of the servant\u2019s livelihood. As a result of these, a father can demand honour of his son, just as a master can demand honour of his servant. However, when it comes to our relationship with God, many people who claim to be God\u2019s children, prefer to relate with God without giving Him the honour due to His Name. Unsurprisingly, this is unacceptable to the One to whom all honour is due.\n\nToday, the Lord is asking, \u201cwhere is my honour?\u201d In other words, there are many honour-thieves in the Christian fold. Are you an honour-thief? If you call on God\u2019s Name without giving it the high regards it deserves, you are an honour-thief. If you fail the materials test, by offering to God a defective gift or a gift that does not befit His status as the King of kings, nor reflect the levels of blessings on your life, you are an honour-thief. If you treat His assignments or handle His work with anything less than the honour due to Him, you are an honour-thief. If your lifestyle makes people look down on your God, you are an honour-thief. If you offer torn currency notes to God, when you know you cannot even use such to pay for things, you are an honour-thief. Do you honour God in all you do?\n\nAction Point: Carefully come up with 5-10 ways of honouring God. Go ahead and implement them.\n\nHymn 9: On The Hill Far Away\n\n1. On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,\nThe emblem of suff\u2019ring and shame;\nAnd I love that old cross where the Dearest and Best\nFor a world of lost sinners was slain.\n\nRefrain:\nSo I\u2019ll cherish the old rugged cross,\nTill my trophies at last I lay down;\nI will cling to the old rugged cross,\nAnd exchange it someday for a crown.\n\n2. Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,\nHas a wondrous attraction for me;\nFor the dear Lamb of God left His glory above\nTo bear it to dark Calvary.\nRefrain:\n\n3. In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,\nA wondrous beauty I see,\nFor \u2019twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,\nTo pardon and sanctify me.\nRefrain:\n\n4. To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;\nIts shame and reproach gladly bear;\nThen He\u2019ll call me someday to my home far away,\nWhere His glory forever I\u2019ll share.\nRefrain:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "\u2013 malachi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zephaniah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malachi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "calvary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill far away", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kjv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "best", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "malachi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:15:22.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "27df0b19b632449229463da3d0f77131b82b8fce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C2d7UuHeQ2hXfvwWkS3KNjQ8glBqG1xCQA--", "site_full": "www.forexfactory.com", "site": "forexfactory.com", "site_section": "https://www.forexfactory.com/forumdisplay.php?f=71", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Trading Systems @ Forex Factory", "title": "Trading Made Simple 4196", "title_full": "Trading Made Simple - Page 4196 @ Forex Factory", "published": "2017-12-06T11:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://cdn-assets.forexfactory.net/images/misc/ff_fb_logo.gif?v=0.1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2596, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "61339bdf3f0f112c61f94857ab4b3812260f6ea5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C2d7UuHeQ2hXfvwWkS3KNjTLEUEkCSIPXPAxI.xKr3rYOT631.QJLFY-", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "yesmanppa", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quoting emmanuel7788 Disliked {Quote: } Hi, those 3 trades you took are very risky because of those large price bars/ candles. now you have to manage those trades well and grab some pips quickly.

The last time North Kingstown won the state title, Bart Starr was the reigning Super Bowl MVP following his performance in the NFL\u2019s inaugural championship game. \nThat drought ended Sunday at Cranston Stadium. \nThe Skippers defeated Moses Brown, 34-16, in the Division II Super Bowl to win their first undisputed title in the school\u2019s 112-year history. (The 1967 title was shared with Coventry.) North forced six turnovers, including four interceptions, in a game that was light years away from the 50- 49 double-overtime classic in the season opener between the two teams. \n\u201cThat was like a preseason game,\u201d North Kingstown head coach Joe Gilmartin said about the September win. \u201cWe\u2019re a lot different now. They\u2019re a lot different now. I\u2019m just happy we could play with them.\u201d \nNorth Kingstown left tackle Ephraim Graham protects quarterback Joe Gilmartin\u2019s blind side against Moses Brown during the Division II Super Bowl on Sunday at Cranston Stadium. Graham is a Jamestown resident. PHOTOS BY ROB SILVEIRA Gilmartin\u2019s son, also named Joe, was awarded the game\u2019s MVP after throwing four touchdown passes, including an 80-yard bomb down the middle of the field to Gabe Sloat in the third quarter. That score gave North Kingstown (13-0, 10-0) a commanding 21-0 lead early in the third quarter. Although two consecutive touchdowns by the Quakers made it a one-score game, a pair of fourth-quarter TD passes by Gilmartin to Zach Pezza iced the Skippers\u2019 victory in their first title game since 1993. \n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely craziness,\u201d the younger Gilmartin said after the game. \u201cThis is amazing. It\u2019s a great feeling to get it done.\u201d \nWhile the offense has been the story for North Kingstown all year \u2014 the Skippers topped 40 points six times, including three games with more than 50 \u2014 the North defense starred in the championship game. Led by Jamestowners Ephraim Graham and Isaiah Proffitt, the defensive front harassed Moses Brown quarterback Mike Walsh all afternoon, including five sacks by Dylan Poirier. \nGilmartin, who graduates in June, said the team began meshing in the summer during their offseason workouts in the weight room. \n\u201cFrom then on, we knew we were going to be a special team,\u201d he said. \nThis Super Bowl victory seemed inconceivable in 2011, which marked the Skippers\u2019 third consecutive winless season. The elder Gilmartin, a history teacher at North Kingstown, was hired in 2012 to turn the program around. With Sunday\u2019s victory, he\u2019s done that. The 2014 Division II coach of the year said it\u2019s been an arduous journey with the players. \n\u201cThey had to develop some pride,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had to develop some sense of camaraderie, team and family. Once we got that done, it was kind of building itself.\u201d \nNow that the Gilmartins are no longer coach and player, the elder Gilmartin is eager to discuss football with his son as a father. \n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of him,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to going home and having a different conversation with him.\u201d \nAlong with players Ben Jennings and Nolan Bush, coaches Bill Piva, Alex Burke and Eric Bush also represented Jamestown on the championship team. \n\u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of the way this season unfolded,\u201d Piva said. \u201cEspecially because I know how hard these kids and the coaches worked to be successful. It\u2019s been a total rebuild of the program since we took over in 2012.\u201d \nPiva said he is optimistic about the future, especially with a team that has exhibited a dedicated work ethic. While 18 seniors are expected to graduate, the JV team also went undefeated and won the state championship. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll have players ready to step in and fill some holes,\u201d he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zach pezza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moses brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "piva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike walsh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben jennings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gilmartin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ephraim graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dylan poirier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill piva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex burke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob silveira gilmartin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nolan bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabe sloat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan maloney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe gilmartin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamestowners ephraim graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bart starr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isaiah proffitt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "quakers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north kingstown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cranston stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamestown", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:15:23.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "58449387fd441aeda2d625338aa5eb0fb03e8fba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94oobUZghFoTw56rYobx08LY.yK9ZTIJWw45A5D2w3POBoUgs2cy1jCCcKuHipJlSlOA8bXfqEo4qX2Kqn3H2jdIY6K1YypakYE3dskKzj84L3ZOuVBVd3oSWFxYrfbhnKG8Zc8JQ_VTQ8LGD0Px9N_hyrqbVYBcDwMSpF8Y1XLhouH.ZOCnIZaoekjGM_SB4V3g--", "site_full": "www.amazon.co.uk", "site": "amazon.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nintendo-Switch-Stand-Lamicall-Adjustable-Black/product-reviews/B01MA4RAQF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_search_rgt?ie=UTF8", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: Nintendo Switch Stand, Lamicall Adjustable Tablet Stand : Desktop Playstand Holder Dock for Nintendo Switch, iPad Pro 10.5 / 9.7 / 12.9, iPad Air 2 3 4 mini, kindle, Nexus, Desk, Accessories, Tab and Other Tablets (4-11 inch) -

Which means you might have picked up a particularly potent Trace rifle in the process. Curse of Osiris introduced a host of new weapons, but none are angering players more than the Prometheus Lens. Especially if you\u2019re coming across them in PvP. The good news then is that Bungie hears you, and says the gun is pretty broken. \nIn fact, it was never meant to be this incredible to begin with. The idea behind the Prometheus Lens is that it creates a sphere of damage around a target you hit with its beam, that then continues to damage the target more. But as you can see in some footage below, those calculations seem to be incredibly unbalanced. In PvP it takes a mere second or two to kill an opponent \u2013 fun from the dealing end, and frustrating on the receiving. \nBungie was quick to state that the weapon happened to ship with a bug (added to a list of many, including the non-existent HDR support) and that they\u2019ll be working to fix it as soon as possible. And they better hurry. With Trials of the Nine this weekend and the Lens still doing the rounds, it\u2019s easy for the gun to completely destroy the most competitive mode Destiny 2 has at the moment. That\u2019s if Bungie doesn\u2019t take it offline entirely first. \nThese sorts of teething issues are expected, and it\u2019s hilarious to see in action sometimes. But for the sanity of most Guardians just looking to burn time in Crucible, I hope it\u2019s fixed relatively soon. \n\nLast Updated: December 7, 2017 Share this:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "prometheus lens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bungie", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:15:23.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf72a44c466884dd5f4b37dd030806d1c86c2c2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9pZjbkz0yttu0HCHKIvYE8KelENHXlU6fh8KUeHcMgJ4AO9zej6m_SYEsAKjNhTiHMXQS4tYKVLZQ3EsVwkjVXTzBD06QzhLxgkaJUdlVojHBxKH8HKQbshEd.DEfSIM-", "site_full": "mybroadband.co.za", "site": "mybroadband.co.za", "site_section": "http://mybroadband.co.za/news/business/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Business \u2013 MyBroadband \u2013 Trusted in Tech", "title": "IT salaries in South Africa \u2013 What people get paid", "title_full": "IT salaries in South Africa \u2013 What people get paid", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 63, "participants_count": 39, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IT-tech-job-salary-payment-money-notes-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5974, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "490c2d908da8c2377698ea4fcd13026bbc92c3ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9pZjbkz0yttu0HCHKIvYE8KelENHXlU6fh8KUeHcMgJ4AO9zej6m_SYEsAKjNhTiHMXQS4tYKVLZQ3EsVwkjVXTzBD06QzhLxgkaJUdlVojHBxKH8HKQbZ8uuuvzDnilqf1y7us_SvA--", "ord_in_thread": 58, "author": "Deal_with__it", "published": "2017-12-07T10:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I'd like to apply for a job on this yacht.

The lawsuit says that Dr. Justin Yeung advised Hart that surgery could be performed by doing a partial fusion of the wrist bones. \nSix weeks after the surgery, Hart had three pins removed and complained about ongoing swelling and pain. Even worse, his index finger and thumb \u201cdid not function.\u201d Yeung allegedly told him to continue to wait to see how he heals. The lawsuit states that \u201cThe defendants were negligent, breached the duties of care they owed to Mr. Hart and breached their agreement with (him).\u201d \nAlso, according to the lawsuit, the defendants left \u201ca tourniquet on Mr. Hart\u2019s right arm on too long, such that the circulation of the nerves and tendons to his right thumb and index finger were damaged by a prolonged insufficient supply of oxygen.\u201d As a result of this, Hart is not able to participate in previous recreational and social activities.

Hoover Institution Research Fellow Kiron Skinner on efforts to stop the mounting threat from North Korea.\nAfter the Japanese attacked U.S. forces at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii exactly 76 years ago, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt famously stated : \u201cYesterday, December 7 th , 1941 \u2013 a date which will live in infamy \u2013 the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.\u201d Could we be headed for another surprise attack \u2013 this time a nuclear one, from North Korea?\nFor a clue, mark your calendar for this date: Dec. 17, 2017. Yes, just a few days away.\nWhy, you ask? That is when I predict North Korea will once again test its new long-range missile, the Hwasong-15 , to commemorate the death of North Korea dictator Kim Jong Il on Dec.17, 2011. His son, the equally ruthless dictator Kim Jong Un, now rules North Korea.\nIf I\u2019m right and Kim Jong Un tests this powerful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) a few days from now, Washington and Pyongyang could very well be placed on a path toward war. This is a war that Kim could very well start first \u2013 with nuclear weapons being his favorite killer of choice \u2013 in a surprise strike that would make Pearl Harbor look like child\u2019s play.\nI would argue that if you can look past President Trump\u2019s \u201cfire and fury\u201d comments threatening to attack North Korea, his gut tells him to try and find another path that avoids war.\nThe steps needed to get from a tension-filled but peaceful Northeast Asia to a potential war that could see the first time nations freely sling nuclear weapons at each other are not hard to imagine.\nWhen Kim test fires his missile, the world will once again collectively shriek with fear and dread. And like clockwork, the normal chorus of talking heads will once again call for using the \u201cmilitary option.\u201d\nThe hawks will argue, with very little specifics or anything approaching a concrete plan of action, that we are \u201crunning out of time\u201d to stop Kim from attaining a nuclear weapon that can hit the U.S. homeland and that a war \u201cover there\u201d is better than here on our own soil.\nPresident Trump will be in the worst of binds. While he might talk tough, the president has shown during the campaign and as commander-in-chief to have a pragmatic \u2013 dare I call it realist \u2013 mindset.\nI would argue that if you can look past President Trump\u2019s \u201cfire and fury\u201d comments threatening to attack North Korea, his gut tells him to try and find another path that avoids war.\nPresident Trump would need to convey a sense of toughness that makes clear the era of strategic patience is truly over and that he is taking a harder line than President Obama. But he would need to find a way to reassure South Korea and Japan, while also sending a tough message to Kim.\nThis is where things get tricky. President Trump could very well order a large-scale U.S. military build-up around North Korea \u2013 something on the surface that does not seem provocative, but would reassure allies and put Pyongyang on notice.\nFor example, the president could authorize an increase in the number of ground troops permanently stationed to South Korea, additional armor and intelligence assets. He could increase the number of F-22 and F-35 jets that operate on a rotational basis there as well as pushing South Korea to accept more THAAD missile defense batteries.\nPresident Trump could also seek to base additional THAAD batteries in Japan. He could also deploy additional armor and air assets to Tokyo to ensure that if war did break-out, military assets would be forward-deployed and ready to go, just in case.\nBut there is a problem with all of this, if you put yourself in North Korea\u2019s shoes. A plan like the one I describe above \u2013 while probably seeming defensive in nature to the average American \u2013 is a nightmare for North Korea.\nKim Jong Un could very well interpret this military build-up as an indication that President Trump is really massing forces for an attack on North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile programs or something worse \u2013 preparation for a U.S. invasion to overthrow Kim and his government.\u2019\nKim would then be in his own bind. He could wait out such a move, and see if American forces halt their build-up at levels that would not allow America to attack his nuclear or missile force or potentially invade.\nOr, Kim could follow through to prevent what his officials have stated time and time again he will not allow: losing his position and his life, as Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi did when they were overthrown.\nIn that case, Kim would have only one choice: to launch a massive surprise attack with the full-range of his military arsenal before America has any chances of destroying it. That means a full nuclear, chemical and biological attack to badly damage his enemies and blunt any coming military strike or invasion that he thinks is coming.\nWhat such a war would look like I have detailed in these digital pages on several occasions.\nImagine a surprise strike by Kim where he launches nuclear weapons at not only Seoul and Tokyo \u2013 two of the most populated cities on Earth \u2013 but also strikes U.S. and allied bases all over Northeast Asia.\nKim could also launch short and medium-range missiles armed with chemical and biological weapons at targets all over Asia, spreading death and carnage throughout the region. This would be nothing like the wars of recent past. The level of devastation would resemble something like the bombed-out cities of World War II, or worse.\nAnd then there is the possibility of a strike on the U.S. homeland with a nuclear weapon \u2013 and not far off into the future, but right now.\nMany experts doubt Kim has mastered the technology to allow an atomic warhead the ability to pass through Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Recent reports concerning his most recent test claim the warhead broke up or exploded in some format during reentry , so we have every reason to be skeptical of his abilities to pull off a nuclear strike.\nThanks to a report in The Diplomat this past August, we know that U.S. intelligence officials believe that if fired in a normal trajectory \u2013 not in a lofted, more up-and-down manner like the last test, which is more stressful on the warhead \u2013 North Korea\u2019s missiles could surprise us.\nAccording to the report , such missiles would \u201clikely perform adequately if flown on a normal trajectory to continental U.S. targets.\u201d That means North Korea, today, could have the ability to drop a nuclear weapon on New York, Washington or anywhere in the U.S. \u2013 with millions of Americans dead thanks to Kim\u2019s very own nuclear Pearl Harbor.\nThankfully the above scenario is fictional and does not need to be our future. Clearly. there is only one off-ramp for America and North Korea \u2013 to sit down and negotiate.\nDespite what many conservatives seem to think, numerous U.S. presidents have tried to talk to North Korea. Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush are all recent examples. And to be fair, those efforts have been a very mixed bag, with many success and many failures.\nHowever, any rational person can read the tea leaves and see that the chance of a war \u2013 indeed, a nuclear war where millions of people could lose their lives \u2013 is now a very real possibility.\nWe owe it to future generations, indeed all of humanity, to work to deescalate this crisis. If we don\u2019t, we might just be doomed to a conflict that for generations will be considered one of the worst in history \u2013 with the recognition that it was completely avoidable.\nHarry J.

You probably feel lost when looking at the documentation or when talking to an insurance agent. Take a look at these tips below to eliminate your confusion and to learn what you need to purchase a good auto policy. Theft of your vehicle factors in when insurance companies calculate your premium. If you have a car alarm or tracker installed on all of your vehicles, you could stand to substantially lower your premium since these prevent theft and aide in the recovery of stolen vehicles, making you less of a liability. There are many types of insurance policies available, and becoming familiar with them is worth your while.. There can be many factors involved with the cost of getting insurance coverage for your vehicle. If http://www. live5news.com/story/3693672 7/news \u2026 cause an accident that results in the death or bodily injury of another person, bodily injury liability insurance will protect you financially. One, less well-known way to get further discounts on auto insurance, especially if you have a teen driver around who is only going back and forth to school, is to request whether your insurance offers a discount for low mileage. If you can accurately estimate the actual mileage your teen drives and report it accurately, you will pay less. Consider purchasing your auto insurance policy online. Many companies offer a discount for online purchases. The companies do this because it costs them less to use an automated system to begin your policy. In most cases, you will see a five to 10 percent reduction in your quote for the policy. Take a course on safe driving. First, you will want to check and see if your car insurance provider offers any discounts for safe driving courses. Many do. Having taken one might qualify you for a discount. The courses themselves are not very expensive and usually do not take more than a week or two to complete. Purchase a high quality \"safety-rated\" vehicle to get lower premium rates. These vehicles are known to be the safest on the market, so insurance companies will give you a bit of extra credit if you are driving one. Look for sedans and family cars, as they are usually the ones with the best ratings. If you have a good health insurance that will cover any cost linked to an injury sustained in a car accident, you can save money by dropping the medical payment features of your auto insurance. You should read carefully your health insurance policy to make sure you are covered for everything. When choosing an auto insurance policy, look into the quality of the company. The company that holds your policy should be able to back it up. It is good to know if the company that holds your policy will be around to take care of any claims you may have. Consider your personal assets when looking for the right auto insurance. If your insurance coverage is good enough, you will never be in danger of losing your personal property from failure to have adequate insurance coverage. An injured party has the right to sue your estate if you do not have enough coverage. Top tier status refers to the percentage of customers from a insurance company that have filed the fewest claims and have the best driving record. Perhaps you qualify as a top tier customer, or your status will improve over the years. Make sure you ask your insurance company to be considered as a top tier customer, as they might not switch your classification automatically. Start carpooling. Many car insurance providers will charge you less if you do not drive your vehicle often. If you drive less than 7,500 miles a year, your premiums might be significantly lower. If you are unable to carpool, try taking the bus or some other form of public transportation. Look for an insurance that offers an accident forgiveness option. If you get into an accident, your premium will not go up. Accident forgiveness works in certain situations: make sure you qualify for it before requesting it. Usually, you can get accident forgiveness if you have a good driving record. To ensure your claims will be dealt with quickly, choose top rated insurance companies only. http:// markets.financialcontent.co m/wral/news/read/35356354/Signature_Insurance_Offers_New_Auto_Insurance_Packages \u2026 may offer low rates and may seem like a good deal in the short run, but if they try to avoid paying your claims, they can cost you in the long run. Research insurance companies and be sure to select one with a good record. The type of car that you drive can have a dramatic impact on your auto insurance rate. Sports cars, high performance vehicles and autos frequently targeted by thieves, all result in high rates for the driver. If you are considering purchasing one of these vehicles, make sure you can afford the higher insurance rates as well as your loan payments. Don't just walk away from an insurance policy when you buy a new one. If you don't notify your auto insurance company that you're changing insurers, your policy will most likely be cancelled for failure to pay. This leaves a negative mark on your record and can result in higher rates in the future. Make sure to get a quote before you buy a new car. nationwide homeowners insurance can vary greatly from model to model and you might be caught surprised with a very different quote after you buy the car. Treat car insurance like any other major purchase, like you would a house, for instance. Ask your insurance carrier about various discounts that you might be eligible for. If you are a student, for example, some companies offer a discount to students with a high grade point average. Some companies additionally offer a discount to people who have certain occupations, so check and see what you might be eligible for. You can protect your car, yourself, and your passengers with the right car insurance coverage. Without it, you could find yourself in serious debt should an accident occur, and possibly even on the wrong side of the law. With the knowledge you have gained from this article, you are now well prepared to look for car insurance.

This is not the first time Happy Rogers has exhibited her proficiency in the language. At an event in Singapore in 2013, the then nine-year-old showed off her nearly perfect Putonghua pronunciation and tone when she recited a not-so-well-known poem by Li Qiao, a Chinese poet during the Tang Dynasty. She won a big round of applause from the audience, most of them Chinese descendants. Happy\u2019s sister Baby Bee, then five years old, did equally well, singing nursery rhymes in Chinese. While it is not uncommon for young Chinese language learners to recite ancient poems, Happy spoke in classical Chinese with a fluency that could make even some native Chinese speakers envious, according to a report in Guangzhou Daily. And recently, during US President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to China, his granddaughter Arabella\u2019s recital of Chinese poems went viral online, making her a \u201cpopular figure\u201d among Chinese audiences. There is a long list of foreign celebrities and their children learning Chinese, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019 four children and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his daughter. Even Prince William, media reports say, studied Chinese in school. The increasing popularity of the Chinese language has led to the introduction of various programmes and classes worldwide. It is estimated that more than 100 million people outside China, including overseas Chinese, are studying the language, as many believe it can be used as a tool to gain access to conveniences in not only China but also some other countries. The growing enthusiasm of people in other countries to learn Chinese can be attributed to their love for Chinese culture. It perhaps explains why traditional Chinese cultural elements, from kung fu films to ancient works such as The Analects of Confucius and Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War, have won so many global diehard fans. Many foreigners even believe that Chinese characters are an expression of aesthetic appreciation \u2013 maybe that\u2019s why many famous personalities including former soccer star David Beckham have got Chinese characters tattooed on their body. China\u2019s economic and social development is another important factor for the growing interest in the language and culture. As the world\u2019s most populous country and the second-largest economy, China for years has accounted for the largest number of students studying in other countries, which might also have made people overseas interested in the language. As Jim Rogers said, whether you like or not, the 21st century will belong to China. He always tells people that if they have children, they shall encourage them to learn Chinese, \u201cbecause Chinese will be the most important language\u201d. For foreign companies intending to do business in China, they can have a huge advantage over their competitors if they can master the language. And with the Belt and Road Initiative progressing smoothly, a number of Chinese enterprises will venture into countries along the ancient trade routes for business, which means a higher demand for Chinese speakers. Source: China Daily/Asia News Network China rising, but English is still king Asia News Network and The Star recently published an article \u201cSway of the Chinese language\u201d, detailing the rising popularity of learning Chinese as posted above. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, US President Donald Trump\u2019s granddaughter and billionaire investor Jim Rogers\u2019 daughter are among some of the famous people or their family members brushing up on their Chinese language skills. Tourists from China are splashing their cash all over the world (in some countries such as Thailand and Malaysia, the Chinese can also go cashless by making their purchases through Alipay). Meanwhile, economists predict that the GDP of China, currently the world\u2019s second largest, would surpass the United States\u2019 within 10 years. As the economic value of the Chinese language grows, it will unseat English to become the world\u2019s leading language. Or so we are told.... But if history is a clue, this may not happen so soon. In the heyday of the Roman Empire, as the great Julius Caesar and his successors conquered the Mediterranean, Latin became the dominant language of the European continent. The Roman Empire began to disintegrate in the fifth century. Latin, however, remained relevant for many centuries to come. (The Eastern Roman Empire, also known as Byzantine Empire, survived into 15th century, but its capital was in Constantinople, and its official language was Greek.) In year 1215, the unpopular King John of England, pressured by rebel barons, issued Magna Carta. The document established for the first time the principle that everybody, including the king, was subject to the law. It is considered one of the first steps taken in England towards establishing parliamentary democracy. The Magna Carta was initially written in Latin. In year 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published three papers which were collectively known as Principia Mathematica. These works form the foundation of classical mechanics. Principia Mathematica, like the Magna Carta, was written in Latin. That was more than 12 centuries after the demise of the Roman Empire. In ancient times, Malay language was the lingua franca of the Malay Archipelago. Then the Western powers came, created the modern states of Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Indonesia. Post-independence, Javanese, who make up 40% of Indonesia\u2019s population, dominate the republic\u2019s politics and economy. Somehow, Bahasa Indonesia is based on Malay rather than Javanese. By 2050, China will become the world\u2019s largest economy. The US will drop to second place. In the third spot, as economists believe, will be India. Like Malaysia, India was a British territory. And like our country, English, the language of the former colonial master, is still widely spoken. By mid-century, the combined GDP of English-speaking and English-as-second-language nations, which include US, India, Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia, will likely be larger than that of China. I do not doubt that Chinese language will get more important every year, and I encourage everyone to learn it if conditions allow. However, it would be foolish if we, in the advent of \u201cChina\u2019s Century\u201d, neglect English.

Our inspirations are Asking Alexandria,Architects , A Day To Remember and Bullet For My valentine. We're looking for a drummer that is flexible to practice often and gig , can use double kick pedals and is committed to playing. We plan on practicing 2-3 times a week on Wednesdays and Thursday's as we get free practice rooms since our vocalist goes to college in Birmingham. Sometimes we will go to a place to practice in Dudley though (it's pretty cheap). We also want to get a lot of practice in as we hope to get our first gig by about summer of next year.

More \\232a \nBy AMANDA LEE MYERS and ANDREW DALTONAssociated Press \nVENTURA, Calif. (AP) - Southern California has felt yellow wind, orange wind, and red wind. But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe color-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the color that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires miles away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 140-square-mile fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily traveled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 16-acre (6.5-hectare) Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 7 acres (2.8 hectares) of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were canceled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behavior specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\" \n___ \nDalton reported from Los Angeles.

Faith is the salvation-grace. We are not saved by love; but we are saved by grace, and we are saved by faith. We are not saved by courage, we are not saved by patience; but we are saved by faith. That is to say, God gives his salvation to faith and not to any other virtue. It is nowhere written \u2014 he that loveth shall be saved. It is nowhere recorded \u2014 that a patient sinner shall be saved. But it is said, \u201cHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.\u201d Faith is the vital part of salvation. If a man lacks faith he lacks everything. \u201cWithout faith it is impossible to please God.\u201d If a man has true faith \u2014 however little he has of any other virtue \u2014 that man is secure. But supposing it possible for a man to possess every virtue in the world, let him be as much a Christian in his exterior; the apostle Paul himself; let him be as earnest as a seraph; let him be as diligent in the service of his Master as you could conceive even an angel on high to be, still \u201cWithout faith\u201d \u2014 so God\u2019s Word declares \u2014 \u201cit is impossible to please God.\u201d Faith is the saving grace \u2014 it is the connecting-link between the soul and Christ. Take that away and all is gone. Remove faith, you have sawn through the ship\u2019s keel, and she must sink. Take away faith, you have taken away my shield and I must be slain. Remove faith, and Christian life becomes a nonentity: it is extinct at once, for \u201d the just shall live by faith:\u201d and without faith how could they live at all? Consider then, that since faith is so important in salvation, it becomes each of us more earnestly to inquire whether we have faith or not? O, my brethren, there are a thousand shams in the world \u2014 a thousand imitations of faith; but there is only one true vital saving faith. There are scores of notional faiths \u2014 a faith which consists in holding a sound creed, a faith which bids men believe a lie, by wrapping them up with assurances of their safety, when they are still in the gall of bitterness and the bonds of iniquity, a faith which consists in presumptuously trusting to ourselves. There are scores of false faiths; but there is only one true one.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle spend time at Nottingham Academy during their first official day of outings as a newly engaged couple. Getty The 36-year-old former Suits star has only had great things to say about the Queen.
