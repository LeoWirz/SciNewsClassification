I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly. John 10:10 (NCV) A thief comes to steal and kill and destroy, but I came to give life\u2014life in all its fullness. Continuing from the last few days, now let us get into the good stuff. We have seen for the past few days how the thief comes to steal, kill, and destroy. Now Jesus shows us what He has come to give us: \u201cI have come that they might have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.\u201d The first part here is that He came to give us life. The \"life\" Jesus offers us is z \u014d\u0113 , which is a life that is filled with vitality. Z\u014d\u0113 is another of the New Testament terms for \"life.\" Z\u014d\u0113 refers to life that is of the highest quality, having reached the fullest potential in the people of God through the finished redemptive work of Christ. In a large number of cases, it refers to \"eternal life,\" not only to heavenly reality, but also to that quality of life initiated by the Spirit of God at conversion. Think about that for a moment. God\u2019s very life was placed in us when we accepted Jesus as our Lord and Savior. This life is not there to give us goose bumps, but to make us world overcomers through Him! The Life of God resides within us, and can never be taken away. His Life will give us all that we need to live victoriously in this world. So today, do not lean on yourself. Lean on the Greater One who lives inside of you. His name is Jesus! Confession: I choose life today; the life of God. His life is inside of me, helping me throughout my day. I am becoming more God-inside minded, and I am listening to His Spirit within me.

(Photo courtesy: AFP Relaxnews/ Horsche/ Istock.com) Italy on Wednesday launched a pioneering programme to identify people with the highest risk of developing Alzheimer's in the hopes of treating them early, as the country waits for a new wave of more effective drugs. The screening project known as \"Interceptor\" aims to better determine who will most benefit from these future treatments, which are expected to be costly and have significant side effects. \"Alzheimer's is a global problem that needs to be, if not solved, at least managed with maximum urgency,\" Italian Health Minister Beatrice Lorenzin said in presenting the programme. According to Lorenzin, one million people in Italy suffer from dementia, with 600,000 having Alzheimer's. \"These numbers will rise in Europe and in developed countries as the population ages,\" she added. With an average age of 44 years and nine months as of 2016, Italy has the oldest population in Europe and the world's second-oldest after Japan. That prompted Italy's government to take the lead in preparing for more effective drugs expected in 2025, the minister said. Interceptor researchers will study patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which can affect memory and language skills and is often a precursor to dementia or Alzheimer's. Project supervisor Paolo Maria Rossini said that of the 735,000 Italians who currently have MCI, half will develop Alzheimer's. \"To give this medicine to more than 700,000 people would bankrupt the system in two years,\" Rossini said. Interceptor then aims to identify the 50 percent of Italians with the highest risk of developing the disease. The EU country has committed 3.5 million euros ($4.1 million) to the 54-week project, which will follow 400 volunteer patients with MCI aged between 50 and 85. \"We will be the first country in the world to have such measures in place before the first drug is introduced,\" Rossini said. More than 50 drugs are being developed in the hopes of slowing down or stopping Alzheimer's, a syndrome in which cognitive ability, emotional control, and social behaviour deteriorate. The World Health Organization estimates that a new case of the incurable disease is diagnosed every four seconds.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rossini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paolo maria rossini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beatrice lorenzin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "afp relaxnews/ horsche/ istock.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp relaxnews updated", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lorenzin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:44.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f066ad7f3af9b1e120281fc86c46456159cc3446", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8IKYHmzr3ZBnrnaur4bf4mZ_RNPGM55dY37OJH906U8B.sz2gI42AFS6FufDUbHKaQQ30dmKLtFHNxaRMSsjpSZ33M1SXJR3H3DcAcL7I3lJNkxFkuc40Tn4J.yGLUoN5GPG4CQEZvK66m_5chATAC", "site_full": "www.nation.co.ke", "site": "nation.co.ke", "site_section": "http://www.nation.co.ke/-/1148/1148/-/view/asFeed/-/vtvnjq/-/index.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Daily Nation | Home", "title": "You'll commit treason, Githu Muigai tells Raila Odinga", "title_full": "You'll commit treason, Githu Muigai tells Raila Odinga", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "KE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/2910840/medRes/1829975/-/9biqvmz/-/adm+pic.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 1833, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 905, "comments": 0, "shares": 905}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f066ad7f3af9b1e120281fc86c46456159cc3446", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8IKYHmzr3ZBnrnaur4bf4mZ_RNPGM55dY37OJH906U8B.sz2gI42AFS6FufDUbHKaQQ30dmKLtFHNxaRMSsjpSZ33M1SXJR3H3DcAcL7I3lJNkxFkuc40Tn4J.yGLUoN5GPG4CQEZvK66m_5chATAC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "You'll commit treason, Githu Muigai tells Raila Odinga", "text": "Nasa sticks with Raila swearing-in \"I reiterate the any attempts to swear in any person as president other than the one elected in line with the constitution and in a manner provided for in the law is unlawful, illegal null and void ab initio,\" Prof Muigai told journalists at the State Law office in the capital Nairobi. Nasa is planning to swear in Mr Odinga using the results of August 8 presidential election on Tuesday to coincide with Jamhuri Day celebrations although they have not disclosed the venue. Mr Odinga, who pulled of the October 26 repeat presidential poll, has maintained that he won the August 8 poll but was rigged out through manipulation of numbers in IEBC servers. At the same time, the AG warned the 11 counties that have passed people\u2019s assembly motion , saying they committed illegalities. Such devolved Houses, he said, may be surcharged for misusing taxpayers\u2019 money. ASSEMBLIES \nHe said the national government retains the right to review the funds allocated to the concerned counties. \nThe AG's warning came hours after Mr Odinga told off the US and other western powers that have advised against the oath plan. The US, Mr Odinga said, should not talk about violation of the constitution as far as his swearing-in is concerned yet Washington DC has been \"loudly silent\" on killing of innocent protesters by police since August. Kenya Police stand accused of shooting and killing dozens in violent protests that followed August 8 General Election and October 26 repeat presidential poll. \"We thought we had friends but we were wrong and now we know they are enemies. Up to today, no single ambassador has condemned the killing of people by police,\" he said.\"The western countries should, therefore, keep off the affairs of the country as Kenyan problems will only be solved by Kenyans themselves.\" He spoke at the City Mortuary in the capital Nairobi when he met and condoled with families that lost their loved ones during the post-poll chaos.

The introduction to this book begins with a fish for each letter of the alphabet.  What a fun way to introduce a variety of fish.  This story has a fun twist.  A little girl and a little boy are teaching their pets; a dog, a cat, and a bird about fish.   \nI'm always looking to see if I learn something new when I select books for my classroom and this book didn't fail me.  Did you know goldfish are orange from the sun.  If they didn't have sun exposure they'd be black.  This book also grabbed my interest because the last third of the book focuses on goldfish.  a common fish most readers are a little familiar with.   \n\nAgain the format for this beginning graphic novel supports early readers with a frame on each page.  I'm not a fan of reading levels beyond helping me learn about a student and plan instruction but this book has some really helpful information for parents and teachers.  There's a page describing what a level 1 level 2 and level 3 book looks like.  Here is where I found a Level 1 is structured for a frame per page while a level 2 could have 1 - 4 panels per page.  I enjoyed learning bout the progression within Toon Books.

To lean to the left or to the right would be deadly. Only by balancing perfectly could he stay alive. In 1 John 2:1-2 there are two truths taught that must be perfectly balanced. Many Christians hold to one of these truths and ignore or redefine the other - to their spiritual detriment. My little children, I am writing you these things so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate  with the Father\u2014Jesus Christ the righteous one.   He himself is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours, but also for those of the whole world. The first truth that John presents is the challenge for each of us - that we might not sin. We have been saved by God's grace from the slavery to sin that came naturally to us and given freedom in Christ to live righteously. We have the indwelling Spirit of God to empower us and we both should and can say no to sin. Yes, I am a sinner and until Jesus takes me to my eternal home I will always be so. But I must never make peace with my sinfulness and act as if it is no big deal. Every sin I commit is an offense against the righteousness of Christ and grieves the Spirit of God within me. God has empowered me to holy living and I must seek to walk in the power he has provided.\n\nBut, no matter how hard I try I will always fail. The \"lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of one's lifestyle\" will always have their pull on my lower nature and sin will rear its head. I will never be perfect. When I sin, I must not give up. I must not quit. I must not despair. I must, instead, remember that I have one who advocates on my behalf. Jesus died to pay for my sins. No matter what I do today, it doesn't matter - my sin is already paid for, my future is certain, and the love of God is secure.\n\nDid you see the conflict in what I said? It matters whether or not I sin. I must not sin. But it doesn't matter when I sin because Jesus is my advocate. This is one of those inherent paradoxes in Christianity. I must always strive to walk in the holiness Christ has provided for me, but I must also rest in the security of his love even when I fail. It is a balancing act, but it is one that leads to glory.\n\nTo say, \"I am secure in Christ, so it doesn't matter how I live,\" is presuming on God's grace. To strive to please God as if you had to earn his love and merit your relationship with him is to insult God's grace, to fail to understand Christ's love. Somehow, some way, we must keep these two \"truths in conflict\" in balance.\nFather, thank you for the absolute, eternal, and comprehensive forgiveness I have through the advocacy of your Son, Jesus Christ. May your grace through him move me to holy living, to purity and to freedom from a life of sin.  \nThink and Pray \nDo you keep these truths in balance?\nDo you seek to avoid sin in Christ's power?\nWhen you sin, do you confess that sin and rely on the power of the advocate that we have, Jesus Christ our Lord?  \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus christ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallenda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "grand canyon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:45.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d4db70ec841fe08560e6ac7f1bf9b52f9a9fe35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Ucus52oE2QydPpRJex_cn621fBO5OFMK7xLY_WYofqrYRoFpFU7NVFbANIVN2eZsAkdqmJsoABh.QStJmcpQwwQIkAuxgrtZGKKedZYQRC9yg--", "site_full": "deeprockmining.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://deeprockmining.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Deep Rock Mining", "title": "Next Time See You At The Dalai Lhama by Guru Guru (1970)", "title_full": "Next Time See You At The Dalai Lhama by Guru Guru (1970)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d4db70ec841fe08560e6ac7f1bf9b52f9a9fe35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Ucus52oE2QydPpRJex_cn621fBO5OFMK7xLY_WYofqrYRoFpFU7NVFbANIVN2eZsAkdqmJsoABh.QStJmcpQwwQIkAuxgrtZGKKedZYQRC9yg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Shane (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Next Time See You At The Dalai Lhama by Guru Guru (1970)", "text": "\n\nGuru Guru are somewhat legends of the Krautrock scene.

When you first learn about \u2018moving lights\u2019* and DMX lighting systems, you learn that there are few elements that must align to successfully control the fixtures. DMX Address and Mode. If these elements are not correct at the desk or the fixture, your system will not behave as you expect.\n*A catch-all term for what I\u2019d call \u2018complex fixtures\u2019 that have more than one channel of control. \nOne common question that I get early on from absolute beginners when you set up a few moving lights with them is why you might need a second universe. This is related to the the next question which is why a fixture has different modes. Why not just do one thing in one way, using up one chunk of DMX channels?\n\nFixture Mode Basics To start with, let\u2019s look at an example situation with a common simple fixture, an LED PAR. Even the most basic of these have a few modes of operation and each of them use up different numbers of DMX channels. Some modes might be:\nRed, Green, Blue \u2013 3 Channels Red, Green, Blue, Dimmer \u2013 4 Channels. Red, Green, Blue, Dimmer, Strobe, Effect, Colour Macro \u2013 7 channels. If this was more complex LED unit with more colours including Amber, White, UV, Colour Correction it would have many more channels, even in the most basic mode.\nIf a moving LED fixture could be split into different zones within the unit itself, this would also add to the channel count. E.g\nZone 1: RGBWAU, Strobe, FX, Macro \u2013 9 Channels Zone 2: RGBWAU, Strobe, FX, Macro \u2013 9 Channels Zone 3: RGBWAU, Strobe, FX, Macro \u2013 9 Channels Zone 4: RGBWAU, Strobe, FX, Macro \u2013 9 Channels Zone 5: RGBWAU, Strobe, FX, Macro \u2013 9 Channels Zone 6: RGBWAU, Strobe, FX, Macro \u2013 9 Channels This may be in addition to some channels that control some more global attributes such as Pan and Tilt and a bunch of others that are commonly found in modern fixtures. Before you know it, you have a fixture that uses 70+ channels. Now with a hard limit of 512 channels in a DMX universe, it becomes apparent why all but the simplest lighting system that involves complex fixtures needs two or more universes.\n16-Bit \u2013 Fine Control A big consideration with LED fixtures is the dimming and colour scales. You hope for, and don\u2019t always get, pleasant dimming curves and the ability to make subtle changes to colour. DMX uses an 8-bit scale of control which means each channel has 256 steps in it, from 0 all the way up to 255. In order to get more steps of control, the fixture maker incorporates two channels of control for one item such as Dimmer or Red. They might be called Dimmer and Dimmer Fine. This is 16-bit control and when applied to each colour LED, each Dimmer channel plus Pan, Tilt, Focus etc. and it very often doubles the channel count for a complex fixture. In our example moving LED fixture, this might take it nearer to 140 channels.\nWhy have fixture modes? Modern lighting fixtures are complex, particularly ones that move and have multiple colour mixing capabilities. Add 16-bit control to many attributes and you end up with a fixture that requires over 100 channels of control to just get it working. Not everyone wants to have to deal with that many channels. Not only does it require anything but the smallest of rigs to require more than 1 DMX universe, but there are many occasions when the user doesn\u2019t want to have to wrangle 6 zones of 16-bit multi-colour mix fixture just to get a red splodge of light on the drummer.\nUsing a different mode can bring the complexity and channel count right down, in this case to perhaps 20 or so channels.\nFixture makers give the user different mode options so that they can cater for a large range of use cases, including as many features as possible while allowing the user to pick and choose which are the most important to them. This results in a simplest, smallest channel count mode, a complex, huge channel mode, and some inbetween. A lot of the time in professional lighting practice, the middle-sized modes are chosen for their balance between features and ease of control, plus being a little more frugal on the DMX channel count.\nHaving all of the features, all of the time, isn\u2019t necessarily an attractive option. Fixture modes give us the choice.\nHey Feed Readers, On Stage Lighting would like to get to know you a bit better. Follow me on Twitter .

The current Cardz 4 Galz Challenge is for snowmen! Here is the card I made to inspire you all. Can't wait to see what you create and post in the challenge.\n\nI used an older Lawn Fawn stamp set ( Making Frosty Friends ), and stamped out these sweet snowmen and their accessories using my Tim Holtz Stamp Platform . I stamped them with Versafine Black Onyx ink and then removed my stamped images from the  Tim Holtz Stamp Platform . I colored them using copic markers, and then replaced the stamped images back into the  Tim Holtz Stamp Platform  and stamped the images again with the  Versafine Black Onyx  ink. This time, I sprinkled on Clear Detail embossing powder from Sparkle N Sprinkle . For the white, I stamped out the images with Versamark Ink, and sprinkled on White Detail embossing powder and heat set them. Once I had all my parts stamped, colored, and heat embossed, I cut them out using matching die cuts. I used Lawn Fawn's Stitched Rectangle Stackables die and die cut a rectangle for my card panel. I used Distress Inks and ink blended some blues onto the card panel. After it was done and dry, I stamped the Lawn Fawn Snowy Backdrops stamp onto the card panel with Versamark Ink , and then sprinkled on Sparkle N Sprinkle's Silver Pearl embossing powder. I also used the sentiment from the  Making Frosty Friends  and stamped out the sentiment with  Versamark Ink , and sprinkled on Sparkle N Sprinkle's Sapphire embossing powder and heat set it.\n\nI also die cut some snowbanks using Lawn Fawn's Stitched Hillside Borders from white cardstock. I rolled on some Sakura Glue Pen , and sprinkled on Sparkle N Sprinkle's Bridal glitter along the edges. I layered these up using foam adhesive, and adhered the snowmen and all their parts on the front of the card. Then, it was done.\n\nI really like this stamp set, and it sure is versatile and a lot of fun. I love having all the parts and can build my snowman however I want it! So much fun!!! I can't wait to see what you create and post for this challenge. Happy holidays!\n\nThanks for stopping by. Have a magical day! \n\n-Chris \n\nSparkle N Sprinkle compensated links are used when possible.

To explore factors that modulate the quantity and quality of signals sent by the crosslinked BCR, we developed a novel chemical mediator of dimerization to induce clustering of receptor-associated SYK. To accomplish this, we fused SYK with E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR), which binds the small molecule trimethoprim (TMP) with high affinity and selectivity and synthesized a dimer of TMP with a flexible linker. The TMP dimer is able to induce the aggregation of eDHFR-linked SYK in live cells. The induced dimerization of SYK bound to the BCR differentially regulates the activation of downstream transcription factors, promoting the activation of Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) without affecting the activation of NF\u03baB. The dimerization of SYK enhances the duration but not the amplitude of calcium mobilization by enhancing the extent and duration of its interaction with the crosslinked BCR at the plasma membrane.\n\nfrom #AlexandrosSfakianakis via Alexandros G.Sfakianakis on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2k6rjJg\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexandros g.sfakianakis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark westbroek robert geahlen clustering", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bcr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tmp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:46.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c710c4d725970f3ab305fdd99b03f3f3f8b3b040", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmkR7q.JRwO_ngYNWb2BRxKMB2J8t09OScdLJ1MqRykCNyt8yiRTBdabbee3_TcW8HJgfgLyoKb1P7uES0XFXpC_z8NqpK7CBa4Qs.Xv0xKnenThYQVX6zhw", "site_full": "readreviewrepeat00.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://readreviewrepeat00.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Read.

Lemons Published: July 13, 2016  Genre: Erotic Romance Take a satisfying bite of this delicious mysterotica, dripping with hot sex and tantalizing intrigue. Investigative Paralegal Daisy Sinclair is shaken to the core when she comes across the brutal crime scene of someone she holds very dear to her heart along with witnessing her long-time friend and high school sweetheart Nikolaos \u201cNiko\u201d Papadopoulos standing over the victim and holding the murder weapon. Niko is quickly arrested as the prime suspect in the murder. Given her history with the suspect and being present at the crime scene, Daisy is thrown right in the middle of the police investigation as a person of interest by a homicide detective who has it out for her boss. Since Daisy has such a close personal connection to the victim and the suspect, she makes it her mission to find out who is responsible for the murder and to prove her friend\u2019s innocence. Dealing with such a personal loss, Daisy finds herself relying heavily on her partner and boyfriend, Criminal Defense Investigator, Warren Cole for the strength to get her through the investigation. Warren takes on the role with ease and as a result their relationship grows deeper. They find themselves not only searching for a murderer, but taking their relationship to the next level and searching for the perfect home to move into. Although not one place seems just right for Daisy, she finds herself faced with wanting more for the first time in her life and wondering if more involves the question with the ring. During the investigation, Daisy comes across some shady and entertaining characters as well as undoubtedly finding trouble along the way. However, will she find the answers she is searching for, will the question arrive, and will the ring make an appearance? If so, is it what she ultimately wants and desires? A sweet craving for more will be the only thing left once this tasty treat of an erotic thriller has been devoured. \u201cI have such an active imagination and I truly enjoy transcribing it into words. As I am writing, the people, places, and things come to life before me and I completely lose myself. Writing is my meditation. I hope you enjoy reading my books as much as I enjoy writing them. Thank you and happy reading.\u201d After receiving a degree in paralegal studies, C. R. Lemons was a paralegal for many years until deciding on a career change of currently managing her award-winning, family-owned business. As a child, she would sneak her mom\u2019s romance novels and lose herself in them. She always had an active imagination and dreamt of sharing it through writing. This dream finally came true with her Getting Him Off Series... Getting Him Off Quickly (Book 1), Getting Him Off Secretly (Book 2) & Getting Him Off Completely (Book 3) along with her naughty poetry musings... Naughtiness is Contagious, An Orgy of Erotic Poetry. As an erotic thriller novelist, C. R. Lemons is a self-proclaimed occasional naughty poet. Her love of writing started through poetry in her teens. She was recently inspired to start writing poetry again and found a talent in the erotica. C. R. Lemons is a native Texan who enjoys her coffee strong, her music rockin\u2019 and her life full of laughter. \n  HOSTED BY: \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daisy sinclair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nikolaos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daisy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren cole", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niko\u201d papadopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "c. r. lemons", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:46.016+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2668fba7e1bbdf0a526c9dddbf4df195c9c1f96d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TbfZ5BDiKrkY4VIAsfJ4qVoc6.WDU_VDpHBtWV5hM3F_jckgXelrcCKkYMeG.aNCFgnRZvXqRozkSo8yira_GU5i1pOyEyo7wUOrpZznAEeA--", "site_full": "artimpressionsstamps.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://artimpressionsstamps.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Art Impressions Blog", "title": "Challenge 222 Funny & Punny WEEK 2!", "title_full": "Challenge 222 Funny & Punny WEEK 2!", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2668fba7e1bbdf0a526c9dddbf4df195c9c1f96d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TbfZ5BDiKrkY4VIAsfJ4qVoc6.WDU_VDpHBtWV5hM3F_jckgXelrcCKkYMeG.aNCFgnRZvXqRozkSo8yira_GU5i1pOyEyo7wUOrpZznAEeA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Art Impressions (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Challenge 222 Funny & Punny WEEK 2!", "text": "\nHello, Ai Fans! \n\nDid you catch our NEW Mouthfuls  release last week?!

The view is not all that pretty , and these simple curtains from vintage fabric\n\nworked very well to camouflage it and still let light in.  Later on, I made some fall curtains with fabric I had on hand. \n\nFor years, I've been wanting to make curtains specifically for Christmas or winter.  I've seen some lovely ideas, but there just hasn't been time to make the curtains.   So I usually just use the geranium curtains shown at top.   They are green and red, after all.\n\nBut this year I tried something different.  I used wooden clothespins to clip red-and-white checked dishtowels to the tension rods.   \n The photo above shows both windows.  Since the dishtowels are not wide enough to cover the entire window, I opted to keep them to one side of each window.\nThis is a better photo as far as showing the color of the walls and so on.  The hooked rug picture, if anyone was wondering, was made by my great-aunt Marjorie with the traditional hand hooking method.\n\nThese \"curtains\" would look nicer if I had enough dishtowels to use two per window, but I only have enough for one each so am going with that for now.

Haydn: Scottish Airs (2014) FLAC (tracks) 24-bit/44.1 kHz | Time - 65:40 minutes | 595 MB Studio Master, Official Digital Download | Artwork: Digital Booklet These arrangements of Scottish traditional melodies are among the little-known gems of Haydn\u2019s later years. Nearing the end of his long career but still at the height of his powers \u2013 these settings are contemporary with 'Die Jahreszeiten' and his last two masses \u2013 Haydn responded to the commission with arrangements full of life and wit. The process of adapting the airs for drawing-room performance was not limited to the provision of new words: early 18th-century anthologies usually equipped the melodies with a figured bass to enable keyboard accompaniment, with optional cello support. By the end of the century, it had become customary to add an obbligato violin part too. This was the scoring Haydn used in his first arrangements of Scottish songs, made for William Napier. According to his biographers, Griesinger and Dies, the composer provided the first batch of 100 settings free of charge to help the publisher out of serious financial difficulties [most un-Scottish, Ed.]. The present disc, however, offers a selection from the more ambitious arrangements, 208 in all, that Haydn made for George Thomson (1757-1841), an ardent collector of old Scots airs who published them fully scored for piano trio. These he commissioned not from minor local musicians, but from the foremost European composers of the day; just as the new poetic texts, when he judged these were required, were sought from leading Scottish writers. Burns began to write for him in 1792, and continued till his death in 1796, the collections from first to last containing about 120 of his songs. George Thomson relates that he was first inspired to dedicate his life\u2019s work to these national melodies when he heard them sung by two Italian artists: Signora Corri and the celebrated castrato Tenducci. Hence their execution here by a distinguished team of lieder and historically-informed performance specialists, who introduce artful variations (birdsong imitations, pizzicato, drone effects) into the settings much as their most accomplished predecessors would have done.

To Pinterest I went and found this pin  that used the mistle \"toes\" pun. I am one for puns so I thought this was really fun! \nI had my Cricut do the write and cut feature which made this project very fast and fun.  \nI tied them on using bubblegum doodletwine .  \nWhile I was on Pinterest I found this hilarious phrasing about red and white wine and just had to use it. So I grabbed a bunch of bottles of champagne ('tis the season!) and made these cute tags! \nI had my Cricut Maker do the writing for me (I am not blessed with that adorable cute writing most of the DT has! lol!) and wrote it on vellum so that the cutest Doodlebug paper would be the focal point. All of this paper is from the Milk and Cookies collection . \nI adhered my vellum and while most of it stayed hidden on some of the tags, the adhesive was showing. No one wants that. So I used liquid glue on the edges and added tinsel glitter for some snowy fun.  \nThen I decorated my trees with sparkle sprinkles and shape sprinkles and just had so much fun with it! Lastly I tied them to my bottle using some awesome doodlebug chunky twine .  \nNow, just write your name and holiday wishes on the back and leave them on someone's doorstep! I am so excited to have something both for adults and for little ladies! \nDid you make neighbor gifts with Doodlebug? We would LOVE to see them!

We look forward to a long and mutually beneficial relationship with TRK.\u201d \nInsight RDM is the mortgage industry\u2019s first cloud-based QC audit platform that was designed in direct collaboration with lenders to deliver the features and functionality needed to reduce repurchase risk and elevate loan quality. Built to be device-agnostic, Insight\u2019s intuitive interface and sophisticated QC auditing tools streamline the loan defect management and remediation process. In addition, integrated action planning and business intelligence reporting from Tableau empower lenders to more effectively track, report and trend loan defects and proactively mitigate future risk. \n\u201cDigital innovation must extend to mortgage QC if lenders hope to maintain and improve loan quality while accelerating the origination process through the pursuit of the eMortgage,\u201d said Teri Sundh, CEO of TRK Connection. \u201cInsight RDM is the engine lenders need to drive loan quality throughout their organization.\u201d \nAbout Waterstone Mortgage Corporation: Headquartered in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, Waterstone Mortgage is a wholly owned subsidiary of WaterStone Bank SSB ( NASDAQ: WSBF ) with assets of more than $1.8 billion. Founded in 2000, the company now originates loans in 43 states.

JAMES #2) There may be times when a gentleman is desperate to gain a lady\u2019s attention, but a gentleman would never resort to desperate measures to obtain it.\u2015A Proper Gentleman\u2019s Guide to Wooing the Perfect Lady Sloane Knox, the Duke of Hawksthorn is guardian for his sweet, younger sister. Due to his misguided past as one of the infamous Rakes of St James, Hawk is hoping to avoid the Season by securing a match for her before it begins. He has the perfect gentleman in mind, but for one infuriating\u2015and unexpectedly intoxicating\u2015obstacle: the intended groom\u2019s own sister, Miss Loretta Quick. Having narrowly avoided her own arranged marriage to an unacceptable nobleman, Loretta is determined that her dear brother\u2015a gentle, good-natured soul\u2015should marry for love. Matching wits with Hawk may be her greatest challenge yet. . .until she realizes it may also be her greatest pleasure. For the young duke\u2019s irresistible charm has not only begun to crumble her stubborn resolve, it has claimed her heart in true love as well. . . Release Date: December 5, 2017 St. Martin's Press The Rakes of St. James #2 Historical Romance Review copy provided by publisher Liza's Review: To the Duke, with Love is the second book in The Rakes of St. James series from Amelia Grey, but the very first book I've read by Amelia Grey. I absolutely adored her voice, so I'm already looking at her backlist for when I'm caught up a bit more on my TBR list. Loretta Quick might just be one of my favorite historical characters ever. She made no apologies for her choices in life and had pretty much decided her fate was to remain at her uncle's hunting home for the rest of her life as penance for ending her engagement right as the wedding was to begin. She also will protect anyone she cares for from being forced into an arranged marriage if at all possible. Enter the Duke of Hawksthorn...and really all of Loretta's choices were going out the window. Seriously loved the banter between these two characters. They attraction was palpable and I impatiently waited for them to be together through much of the book. In fact, my only issue with the story was how long it took for Hawk and Loretta to actually make love. I loved that Loretta continuously thought of the kisses she and Hawk shared, and Hawk wasn't really any different, as he worked to make it possible to see Loretta again as often as possible. The romance between their siblings was a sweet romance, and it really seemed to be the polar opposite of the one between Loretta and Hawk, who had a hard time staying away from one another and keeping their hands off each other from the very beginning. I think seeing the two couples showed that both types of romances can work, though, I much preferred Loretta and Hawk's romance. To the Duke, with Love was a very enjoyable historical romance. I really enjoyed Amelia Grey's voice and look forward to reading more books from her in the future. I highly recommend To the Duke, with Love to all readers who enjoy historical romance books.

One NE of Petrey near Ainsley. Last I knew, Bob Wells was club prez. He's a banker in Troy. Nice guy.\nAnother club is about 2,000-ac on Bee Branch between Petrey and Luverne. I don't know their club prez but am told they are also on strict QDM program.\nOur lease in Petrey is roughly 5,000 ac. This is our 20th year on strict high end QDM. Shooter buck must be 4.5 or older. Limited to 15 total members. We screen for members who live 2 hrs or more away. Very restrictive rules about guests, stand choice based on wind direction, closing areas of the lease each week to rest it, etc.\nWe turnover a few guys every year. Reasons range from job transfer, family problems, health issues, or different expectations. Most common reason is differing expectation. For example, a man of integrity joins who is tired of brown-it's-down clubs. Thinks he is ready to step up to an intensively managed lease. After a couple seasons of passing up underage bucks, he comes to the conclusion it's not for him. He doesn't break the rules, but realizes the right thing to do is leave on good terms and find a club where he can shoot younger bucks.\nThen we occasionally get a member who turns out to be an armchair biologist. He is a good guy with good intentions. Not a troublemaker. Just wants to do his part and improve the lease. But he has unrealistic expectations for the kind of deer that Alabama can produce. He is convinced that Crenshaw County can produce bucks like Illinois or Iowa if we just have a few acres of soybeans and run a few protein feeders. After all, that's what Lee & Tiffany said.\nEdited by WildlifeBiologist ( 12/06/17 02:40 PM )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:49.036+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3934d6b4e8a96acab4aeb6b44c6be464a5ee4134", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFprwaXCO45YPB9ndTtbCH4A5dCFYf7XCSh4vKID2Eptl4I37LIlvEG_DKTxryxqJBw-", "site_full": "gtaforums.com", "site": "gtaforums.com", "site_section": "http://gtaforums.com/forum/77-debates-discussion/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Debates &amp; Discussion - GTAForums", "title": "Anti-natalism", "title_full": "Anti-natalism - Debates & Discussion - GTAForums", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://gtaforums.com/public/style_images/GTAForums_2014/meta_image.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27700, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3934d6b4e8a96acab4aeb6b44c6be464a5ee4134", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFprwaXCO45YPB9ndTtbCH4A5dCFYf7XCSh4vKID2Eptl4I37LIlvEG_DKTxryxqJBw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dealux", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Anti-natalism", "text": "#1 Posted 6 days ago\nAnti-natalism is, roughly speaking, the view that bringing new life into existence is essentially morally wrong because life on balance is more pain than pleasure and the most awful pains are worse than the best pleasures. I guess this view may also address the issue of whether life is worth living or not by extension and it is that part of philosophy that no one talks about and it came to my attention recently for better or for worse. I think it's certainly a dangerous thing to tell to someone who is depressed but logically speaking there doesn't seem to be any real reason to live and yes, bringing life into existence doesn't really have any ultimate value. I don't even think of myself as a nihilist really but I see how our inherent bias towards living prevents us from thinking clearly on this subject.\nI used to have this intuition that the potential for positive experiences outweighs nonexistence but that doesn't make any sense to me now. Even if you had the best life possible, not existing wouldn't really be worse because there is nothing there to experience a lack of something. Not existing isn't really a lack of something. It's literally nothing. Maybe the problem here is that this comparison is impossible but even that doesn't seem to make the arguments in favor of existing hold any more weight.\nAm I the only one who finds this subject interesting?\nAlso, here's a podcast debate that just came out on the topic.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://youtube.com/embed/1s88Ze41pRU?html5=1&fs=1"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:50.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c5816dbaea08d74d85b019be31262c8407f25844", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW1xf7ieD78V08ldQuj73MdRiG64.GxqzYocTIa7Ck2SwBu76SmGXogU3Lws1LTzxeanhYhl.Ir6A--", "site_full": "news.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/news?query=a&start=22&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "", "title": "CHINA MALDIVES DIPLOMACY", "title_full": "CHINA MALDIVES DIPLOMACY : \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ub274\uc2a4", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "KS", "spam_score": 0.978, "main_image": "http://imgnews.naver.net/image/origin/091/2017/12/07/6217137.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c5816dbaea08d74d85b019be31262c8407f25844", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW1xf7ieD78V08ldQuj73MdRiG64.GxqzYocTIa7Ck2SwBu76SmGXogU3Lws1LTzxeanhYhl.Ir6A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EPA\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4 | \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ub274\uc2a4", "published": "2017-12-07T11:29:00.000+02:00", "title": "CHINA MALDIVES DIPLOMACY", "text": "President of the Maldives Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom visits China\nPresident of the Maldives Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom (L) and China's President Xi Jinping (R) look on during a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, 07 December 2017.
