(AP) \u2014 Columbus North swimmer Nick Green didn't quite understand how severe his condition was when he was diagnosed with osteochondritis dissecans right before his freshman season. \nMultiple doctors informed Green and his family that he could lose his ability to walk if he didn't treat the condition in a timely manner. \nSome bone in Green's right knee was dying and getting absorbed, which was creating a hole. Doctors told him that more would continue to break off if he didn't get it fixed. \n\"It definitely took me by surprise,\" Green said. \"I don't really know the word for it. I was just shocked. I was very upset. I didn't think I was going to have my high school season, to be honest. But we found a doctor who said I could swim and have my high school season.\" \nGreen finished his freshman swim season before having his surgery in March. Doctors had to drill on the sides of his knee and insert screws to establish blood flow for his bone to grow. \nThe doctors took bone from his hip and partially filled the hole with bone plugs in hopes of having the rest of his bone grow back. Green received good news when a doctor told him at his most recent checkup that the bone was growing back. \nGreen's next check up is on Thursday, where doctors will check the progress and see if any screws in his knee have migrated. \nGreen, who has been swimming competitively since he was 6 years old, wasn't sure if the surgery would work, which put his entire swimming career in jeopardy. Fortunately for Green, he spent eight weeks on crutches, but was allowed back in the water just two weeks after the surgery. \nGreen eventually transitioned to a custom-fit unloader knee brace to help shift the weight from the healing portion of his leg. He participated in physical therapy once a week at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital for about four months. \nAlthough he could get back in the water, Green wasn't allowed to kick for six months. He put a pull buoy between his legs to prevent himself from kicking, which put a lot of strain on his upper body muscles. \nGreen had to push off with one leg for his flip-turns and did only upper body lifts in the weight room. He couldn't even carry weights around because he couldn't have any more than the weight of his back pack weighing down on him. Green spent almost an entire year not kicking his legs in the water. \n\"It's just a long process, and it's still not over,\" Green said. \"They said it's going to take up to two years to completely heal all the way because I guess bone grows back really slowly.\" \nGreen still is dealing with a lot of pain, but said he is happy he still gets to compete this year. He swims the 200- and 500-yard freestyle events for the Bull Frogs and is also hoping to get on relay teams this year. \nGreen is not yet able to do any impact activity like running, but his doctor informed him that moving his leg around in the pool can actually be good for his recovery. \nGreen is back to regular swimming workouts and competitions for his sophomore season. He isn't all the way back to where he was, but is slowly working on getting there. North coach Logan Schaefer said they both have been working on focusing on the things Green is able to do and do the best they can. \n\"I think once we start to move and progress overall to getting back to full swimming, I think those things that we could do are going to be some strengths as we build back into more of the kicking and those types of things that we couldn't do a whole lot of recently,\" Schaefer said. \nGreen already is getting close to the times he swam last season, which is a good sign of how his recovery is going. He has aspirations of gaining a college scholarship for swimming and said he is glad osteochondritis dissecans hasn't taken those opportunities away from him. The goal is to be back at 100 percent by next season. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Shiri is the minister of lands while Mpofu is at home affairs. The quartet and a lands officer, Sibonginkosi Moyo, were cited in an urgent chamber application filed at the Bulawayo High Court by four resettled farmers who were given pieces of land at Heany Junction Farm in Matebeleland North. Over 380 families were settled at the farm in 2013. Nqobani Ndlovu, Zephaniah Dube, Ntombizodwa Mhlanga ad Bishop Ngwenya were ordered to vacate the farm on November 8 by former lands minister Douglas Mombeshora. The quartet was later arrested on charges of contravening a section of the Gazetted Lands (Consequential Provisions) Act. However, in their urgent chamber application, the quartet said they were given the authority to occupy the land by Home Affairs minister Obert Mpofu. Mpofu is also the Member of Parliament for Umguza constituency in Matebeleland North. \u201cThe first respondent (Air Marshal Perence Shiri) has always known of our existence at this farm having been authorised by the second respondent (Minister Obert Mpofu) who is an MP for Umguza Constituency in whose jurisdiction the farm falls under. \u201cOur existence has never been challenged as the second respondent assured us that we were lawfully settled and thus we could build our homes,\u201d reads the application. They are seeking an order interdicting the state from evicting them from the farm and unlawfully demolishing their homesteads. They also want an order blocking the respondents from interfering with their families at the disputed farm.

(Supplied) SRC starts bail fund for students arrested at Rhodes \nGrahamstown - The Rhodes University Council - the institution's highest decision-making body - has decided it was not a \"prudent\" time to rename the university. \nOver the past few years the university has faced a growing outcry from student activists and Fees Must Fall leaders over its name, with many students referring to it as the \"university currently known as Rhodes\". \nIn a statement, the university said its council initiated a process to advance transformation and address some of the concerns raised by students in 2015 - the name being one of the main considerations. \nThe council met on November 30 and discussed the topic, along with a range of other issues. \nHowever, the university decided not to change its name at this stage. \n\"Council deliberated extensively about the many aspects and possible consequences of the decision under consideration. Council members accepted that, when it comes to the issue of the name of the university, it could not reconcile some of the differences and it was unlikely to emerge with a decision immunised from significant consequences,\" the university said in a statement on Wednesday. \nA path to reimagine itself \nThe university said it had been pursuing a path to reimagine itself as part of its transformation drive. However, this would be incomplete as long as the university still shared a name with Cecil John Rhodes. \n\"It would not be prudent to rename the university and invest significant financial and other resources in a major international rebranding project with limited, if any, guarantee that the identity and reputation that have drawn learners and leading scholars from South Africa, the African continent and across the globe to our university would, at the very least, remain recognisable,\" it said. \nThe university said it had recently obtained permission from the families of struggle stalwarts Charlotte Maxeke and Robert Sobukwe, and Enoch Sontonga - who composed Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika - to use their names to rename some buildings. \n\"Rhodes University has been, and remains, committed to the redress of the wrongs of the past and to build an even stronger institution that every African, including all the residents of Makana local municipality, can be proud of,\" the university said. \nFinancial sustainability \nSome of the other main concerns that the university said should be considered before changing the name was grappling with the university\u2019s financial sustainability, staff remuneration, employment equity, and Student Financial Aid. \n\"There are many academically-capable young people who, through no fault of their own, cannot afford to access a quality higher education. Every year our university invests about R38m to assist academically-deserving students who are in financial need,\" the university said. \nOther issues include the upliftment of the local community, maintaining infrastructure, and addressing institutional culture.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/news24", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "enoch sontonga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cecil john rhodes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert sobukwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nkosi sikelel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte maxeke", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rhodes university council", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rhodes university", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "grahamstown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "makana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:34.149+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c25fdee79a3ba1440d120ee3c348fc7b8b2618c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9dqnOz0Pt3dequAqadAv2TwLxQtm6V_Ef7T0rbiu63XVD9fZ3G5hw1PgLn0us3PUbKCkPsbWwbiRTrFQ4N114VUiN8HK6ZC6syX66xI3QKJPI1mm0b4dsJrD45onPgvjwJqcrMw2agBabGL78RHIaxHcvPcEKFEz7SAVXhlIPX2ea5.ZZjrwURXL9PB0nSM.XS3RasrYEaAxmcTxEDs9I8nTULuaCxQQf7Z0b6ELHP7mcvWYGmgzMHwS3f8QBvH3ynW8NpWb76Ww--", "site_full": "www.apnewsarchive.com", "site": "apnewsarchive.com", "site_section": "http://www.dothaneagle.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=100&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&nsa=eedition&c[]=news,news/*&f=rss", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "www.dothaneagle.com - RSS Results in news,news/* of type article", "title": "FBI director heads to Hill after Trump's attacks on agency", "title_full": "FBI director heads to Hill after Trump's attacks on agency", "published": "2017-12-07T10:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dothaneagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/30/5309c118-de8e-5076-ad52-e421e0d57cb1/5a284588d2218.image.jpg?resize=971%2C630", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c25fdee79a3ba1440d120ee3c348fc7b8b2618c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9dqnOz0Pt3dequAqadAv2TwLxQtm6V_Ef7T0rbiu63XVD9fZ3G5hw1PgLn0us3PUbKCkPsbWwbiRTrFQ4N114VUiN8HK6ZC6syX66xI3QKJPI1mm0b4dsJrD45onPgvjwJqcrMw2agBabGL78RHIaxHcvPcEKFEz7SAVXhlIPX2ea5.ZZjrwURXL9PB0nSM.XS3RasrYEaAxmcTxEDs9I8nTULuaCxQQf7Z0b6ELHP7mcvWYGmgzMHwS3f8QBvH3ynW8NpWb76Ww--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "SADIE GURMAN Associated Press", "published": "2017-12-07T10:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "FBI director heads to Hill after Trump's attacks on agency", "text": "FBI director heads to Hill after Trump's attacks on agency By SADIE GURMAN Associated Press 2 hrs ago Save \nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Christopher Wray faces a tough test four months into his leadership of the FBI: He must defend America's top law enforcement agency against blistering attacks from President Donald Trump without putting his own job at risk. \nThe competing pressures Wray faces will be on display Thursday when he testifies before the House Judiciary Committee. Democrats may push him to respond forcefully to Trump's weekend tweets calling the FBI a biased agency whose reputation is \"in Tatters \u2014 worst in History!\" and urging Wray to \"clean house.\" \nSome Republicans will likely echo Trump's concerns about what they see as political bias in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of possible coordination between Trump's campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. Like Trump, they have seized on revelations that an FBI agent was removed from Mueller's team because of anti-Trump text messages. \nWray's start as FBI head would have been difficult enough, even without the intense scrutiny of the Russia investigation. Since he was sworn-in Aug. 2, the U.S. has had two of the deadliest shootings in its modern history and a terror attack in Manhattan. \nTrump's weekend tweets created a fresh dilemma for Wray. With his bosses, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy Rod Rosenstein, staying publicly silent, it fell to Wray to defend the agency. But FBI directors traditionally have been low-key and stoic \u2014 with Wray's predecessor, James Comey, a notable exception. And Trump's firing of Comey while he led the Russia probe shows the risk of antagonizing the president. \nWray's defense, in an email to FBI employees this week, didn't directly mention Trump's comments, leaving some current and former officials wishing he had pushed back more forcefully. \nWray said he was \"inspired by example after example of professionalism and dedication to justice demonstrated around the bureau\" and urged agents to \"keep focused on our critical mission\" while constantly under a microscope. \nFor some agents still reeling from Trump's firing of the popular Comey, the episode cut to the heart of their deepest concern: whether a Trump-appointed FBI director would be able to stand up to a president who routinely lashes out at law enforcement and has publicly lamented his inability to directly influence the agency's affairs. \nWray repeatedly promised during his confirmation hearing that he could be independent, but \"the jury is still out\" on whether he has demonstrated that, said Frank Montoya Jr., a former senior FBI official who keeps in contact with agents still on the job. \n\"The absence of comment from the top, to us, has been really frustrating,\" Montoya said. \"On the inside, it's like, why are we still a punching bag and nobody is counter-punching? A word of comfort or of calm or a sign of leadership would be appreciated at this time.\" \nWray has stayed mostly under the radar in his first months on the job and has subtly tried to distance himself from Comey, who was widely criticized for publicly announcing that Hillary Clinton shouldn't face criminal charges for her use of a private email server. Wray, for example, said he couldn't imagine holding a news conference about someone who had not been charged, noting Justice Department policies against doing so. \nThose close to Wray, a former high-ranking Justice Department official in the Bush administration, describe him as a steady hand whose low-key demeanor makes him well-suited to lead the FBI during a tumultuous time. He has seemed relaxed but reserved in his few public appearances. His memo Monday to employees ended with his favorite work-ethic maxim: \"Keep calm and tackle hard.\" \n\"In a society sometimes fixated to a fault on results, I am somebody who is a big believer in the importance of the integrity of process,\" Wray said at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in October. \"That's part of how I am hoping to sort of steady the ship. By staying laser-focused on the mission and the work itself, day in and day out, left foot right foot, grinding away. Following the rules. Following the law. Trying to make sure we are doing the right thing, but in the right way.\" \nTom O'Connor, president of the FBI Agents Association, said Wray has been supportive of agents' concerns so far, meeting with the organization shortly after his confirmation. \n\"He has said that, in the four months since becoming director, he has learned more about, and is even more impressed with, agents' work ethic and commitment to the bureau's mission,\" said O'Connor, who issued his own impassioned defense of the FBI after Trump's attacks. \nOthers defended the agency as well, including Eric Holder, attorney general under President Barack Obama, who urged Justice Department leadership to speak out. Comey himself tweeted, \"The FBI is honest. The FBI is strong. And the FBI is, and always will be, independent.\" \nBut a retired FBI official said the bureau's head needs to keep praise and support quiet and internal. \n\"If you've been there for 20-some years, you might not see attacks this high-profile, but you're going to see attacks over and over and over on the organization,\" said Robert Anderson, a former FBI executive assistant director. \"The way to really beat that stuff is to dig in and do what you do best, and the agency is really going to shine.\" More from this section", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sadie gurman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montoya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael balsamo save", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rod rosenstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james comey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom o'connor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher wray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "comey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank montoya jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o'connor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balsamo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric holder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wray", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hill after trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi agents association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook  file", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international association of chiefs of police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:34.157+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10d2f502e6946ba909dae1e6461c33bc8c22b2e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Wjftei94Pt_YWcRrT300Ya3oEGMVbe76CP_9cTkxE9z__2oKeaMzO_ChanUlApTqGlGfZwhPf.2hpWKtyP0VAuHOgaJ8IeZA60XJ9GMLyP84TThxKkog4Mwg2yF8quiq7HsWrj57J0efuetckn0TrNjI7V2SJ5GuS3Mv1sFbLHUykfbrlLCuz", "site_full": "www.cheyennejournal.com", "site": "cheyennejournal.com", "site_section": "http://www.cheyennejournal.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "business", "marketing"], "section_title": "Cheyenne Journal", "title": "District 3 Nebraska Senator, Carol Blood, Announces Bold 2018 Military Families Initiative", "title_full": "District 3 Nebraska Senator, Carol Blood, Announces Bold 2018 Military Families Initiative", "published": "2017-12-07T10:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10d2f502e6946ba909dae1e6461c33bc8c22b2e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Wjftei94Pt_YWcRrT300Ya3oEGMVbe76CP_9cTkxE9z__2oKeaMzO_ChanUlApTqGlGfZwhPf.2hpWKtyP0VAuHOgaJ8IeZA60XJ9GMLyP84TThxKkog4Mwg2yF8quiq7HsWrj57J0efuetckn0TrNjI7V2SJ5GuS3Mv1sFbLHUykfbrlLCuz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "editor", "published": "2017-12-07T10:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "District 3 Nebraska Senator, Carol Blood, Announces Bold 2018 Military Families Initiative", "text": "Print This Article Share it With Friends Senator Continues Efforts to Remove Barriers LINCOLN, NE \u2013 7 Dec, 2017 \u2013 District 3 Nebraska Senator Carol Blood announced today that she will present a very bold military families initiative in the upcoming session that begins on January 3, 2018. After the 2017 legislative success of LB 88, which removed hurdles in over 30 areas of employment for military spouses and included other supportive legislation for our military community, Blood has been motivated to create new legislation to continue to remove barriers to employment and create policy that supports the well-being of service members and their families. \u201cIt is important to highlight the base\u2019s estimated 1.7 billion local economic impact on our surrounding communities and why we must work hard to keep this base here in Nebraska,\u201d stated Senator Blood. \u201cAs we look to make Nebraska one of the most military-friendly states, we must also continue to enact and revise legislation covering licensure and employment protection, consumer protection, family law, child care and protection, voting, education, healthcare, state judicial systems and disposition of human remains. Some of these issues do not require legislation, but need active partnerships with outside organizations to make it happen. This is a bipartisan issue that we should all be able to support and move through the process without hesitation.\u201d This initiative includes the following: Military Civil Relief Consumer Protection Act Physical Therapists Interstate Compact Advanced Practice Registered Nurses Compact Military Spouse Realtors Licensing Accommodation Military Medicaid Waiver (for transitioning special needs military family members not covered by TRICARE) Military Spouse Attorneys Licensing Accommodation (Initiated process with Nebraska Supreme Court-See OWH Midlands Voices 11/29/17) Pro bono legal representation for service members and families (Working with Nebraska Non-Profit to provide these services) Military Representation on Certain State Boards and Councils that pertain to mental health and early childhood development councils (Working with Nebraska organizations to encourage Military presence on these types of boards/councils) \u201cI know this is a very bold initiative, but it is only the tip of the iceberg of what we can and need to do here in Nebraska,\u201d Blood explains. \u201cWe talk a LOT about the next round of BRAC and we need to remember that part of that formula is not just about the runway and missions, although a paramount factor, but also about how we embrace and protect our service members and their families. I have a fire in my belly and will continue to push for these types of policies over the course of my tenure in the legislature.\u201d Senator Blood has been working closely with the USA4Military Families Department of Defense State Liaison Office since June 2017 to insure that Nebraska Legislation is competitive with other states and to craft the most effective legislation possible.

AAP/Lukas Coch/via REUTERS\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia became the 26th nation to legalise same-sex marriage on Thursday, prompting cheers and singing from a packed parliament public gallery in a country where some states ruled homosexual acts to be illegal until just 20 years ago.\nLawmakers, who had cast aside a conservative push to allow religious objectors to refuse service to same-sex couples, waved rainbow flags and embraced on the floor of the chamber, where earlier in the debate a politician had proposed to his same-sex partner.\nFewer than five of 150 MPs voted against the law.\n\"What a day. What a day for love, for equality, for respect,\" said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \"...It is time for more marriages.\"\nThe laws, which will also recognise same-sex marriages solemnised in foreign countries, take effect from Saturday. Because a month's notice is required for the state to recognise a marriage, the first legal same-sex unions will be in January.\nAustralians had overwhelmingly endorsed legalising same-sex marriage in a postal survey run by the national statistics agency.\nThe bill cleared the upper house last month and had been expected to pass on Thursday after Turnbull's Liberal-National coalition government and the main opposition Labor Party had previously said they wanted to pass it by Dec. 7.\nBut religious organisations and conservative lawmakers had voiced strong opposition and proposed dozens of amendments.\nDuring parliamentary debate, they pressed for broad protections for religious objectors, among them florists and bankers, to refuse service to same-sex couples.\n\"These amendments, rather, are a shield for people and organisations that hold to a traditional view of marriage. They are not a sword to be wielded in the service of bigotry,\" government MP Andrew Hastie said in parliament.\nAmendments to permit lay celebrants to decline to solemnise same-sex marriages and businesses opposed to the unions to refuse service at wedding receptions were all defeated, one after the other, during three days of debate.\n\"Love has won, and it's time to pop the bubbly,\" Greens MP and same-sex marriage supporter Adam Bandt said.\n(Reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Nick Macfie)\n-- \u00a9 Copyright Reuters 2017-12-07", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:34.164+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "56fa65985ffe2a83ece0c8fedefdd1c6cb461858", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSC4DF4x34E0vmLxx7R60Kv4rUhCRjs5jHAVZx0RLtPj1sBUklAEkQuhImea83YRlW0FB2MLPc7uTySir_.dO2FN.oyB8pIh7TWY4Mi2nCu3Q--", "site_full": "albuquerque.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://albuquerque.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist albuquerque | for sale search", "title": "RUSTIC/SW DINNERWARE, CROWN CORNING", "title_full": "RUSTIC/SW DINNERWARE, CROWN CORNING", "published": "2017-12-07T10:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00404_2isZOctOpTj_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "56fa65985ffe2a83ece0c8fedefdd1c6cb461858", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSC4DF4x34E0vmLxx7R60Kv4rUhCRjs5jHAVZx0RLtPj1sBUklAEkQuhImea83YRlW0FB2MLPc7uTySir_.dO2FN.oyB8pIh7TWY4Mi2nCu3Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "RUSTIC/SW DINNERWARE, CROWN CORNING", "text": "make / manufacturer: CROWN CORNING JAPAN QR Code Link to This Post SOUTHWEST FLAIR AND STYLE 32 PIECE JAPAN CROWN CORNING DINNERWARE TURQUISE/W RUST AND WHITE W/ RUST 8 DINNER PLATES", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:34.177+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3b908d042cc4417e5b297a622985a66b4c8b092e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9dqnOz0Pt3dequAqadAv2TwLxQtm6V_EdzflD6X2uKfuGuPLA4VkBD85wm65NwomQV.sSXPlhQZC93kbt3Wpv1j9NVYoELu49GvaGmfuD40E6BspKhWMz3kxyBOlZtMmP6wpTvoRShh6D8xY3uwkLBTNjdqkR64OwaT7ZkFrJhxmbrRqBFN7ah7JT6b8i3IuKFjyMCBatgnHJkSTygZJ68P36FbQJHPytzmGJ9OYjyMy_QQJSQIica61FI6TbQO_BA1996KCkHMw--", "site_full": "www.apnewsarchive.com", "site": "apnewsarchive.com", "site_section": "http://www.dothaneagle.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=100&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&nsa=eedition&c[]=news,news/*&f=rss", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "www.dothaneagle.com - RSS Results in news,news/* of type article", "title": "West Virginia turkey hunters take fewer birds", "title_full": "West Virginia turkey hunters take fewer birds", "published": "2017-12-07T10:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dothaneagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/1519d578-ef15-11e6-b287-630cca68c4c5.jpg?_dc=1486678451", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3b908d042cc4417e5b297a622985a66b4c8b092e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9dqnOz0Pt3dequAqadAv2TwLxQtm6V_EdzflD6X2uKfuGuPLA4VkBD85wm65NwomQV.sSXPlhQZC93kbt3Wpv1j9NVYoELu49GvaGmfuD40E6BspKhWMz3kxyBOlZtMmP6wpTvoRShh6D8xY3uwkLBTNjdqkR64OwaT7ZkFrJhxmbrRqBFN7ah7JT6b8i3IuKFjyMCBatgnHJkSTygZJ68P36FbQJHPytzmGJ9OYjyMy_QQJSQIica61FI6TbQO_BA1996KCkHMw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "West Virginia turkey hunters take fewer birds", "text": "West Virginia turkey hunters take fewer birds Dec 7, 2017 \nSOUTH CHARLESTON, W.Va.

making a step forward in achieving ballast-free shipping and curbing the threat of the spread of invasive species carried in a ship\u2019s ballast water. \nAn estimated 10,000 marine species are transported around the world in ballast water every day, according to the figures from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). \nAs a result ballast water discharged from ships has been identified as one of the largest pathways for the introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species, which are a major threat to the ecological and economic well-being of the planet. \nDriven by the idea and the entrance into force of the Ballast Water Managment Convention (BWM), Dalian Shipbuilding Industry (DSIC) and GTT have unveiled a new ship design concept which doesn\u2019t include ballast water tanks. \nThe 30,000m\u00b3 B-FREE LNG carrier design has received approval in principle (AiP) from Lloyd\u2019s Register (LR) in a ceremony at Marintec China on December 5. \nAccording to LR, the innovative design has several advantages over conventional designs (based on Type C cargo tanks and using ballast), combining environmentally-friendly features with increased efficiency as well as predicted lower build and operating costs. \nSavings in build cost are expected through the avoidance of fitting a ballast water treatment system (BWTS) and not having to comply with the Performance Standard for Protective Coatings (PSPC) for ballast tanks, ballast piping, pumps and values. \nOperational savings should be seen from no need to run and maintain a BWTS, ballast systems and maintain ballast tank coatings. Initial predictions also show lower fuel consumption compared to \u2018standard\u2019 designs as well as lower LNG boil-off due to the GTT membrane, compared to a Type C tank, LR said. \n\u201cWhile we are still in the initial stage of the project and the design is subject to ongoing change, the initial results are indicating that we will meet our goal of having a ballast-free ship that is equal to, or better than existing conventional designs. \n\u201cThe cumulative improvements in operating costs coming from the combination of the various innovations and new ideas applied to the design are better than we anticipated, although we should be mindful that this is only the preliminary results phase and we need phase two to further refine and validate the design, we are hopeful this will result in more efficient small-scale LNG carriers, \u201d Ma Yingbin, Vice Chief Engineer, DSIC , said. \nAs explained by Yingbin, interest received from owners and operators so far has exceeded the companies\u2019 expectations. \nDavid Colson, Commercial VP of GTT, said that the ballast-free was an old idea that GTT had in mind several years ago. \n\u201cThe good teamwork between the three parties in China enabled us to move forward with the design to this stage. The first results show that this ballast-free design has also introduced complimentary advantages such as a reduction in the number of cargo tanks, handling equipment, engine power, and more,\u201d he added.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ma yingbin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yingbin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david colson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lloyd", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pspc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalian shipbuilding industry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dsic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. national oceanic and atmospheric administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "performance standard for protective coatings", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "marintec china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:35.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "524924df28690415565783e13be1c7cc43b9a425", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFpA763SLAVkyj6N07yohvQfie3F5F_DLjUN6KuetXCZgL2wUldl6ONhs_qhvK6yxcsVEphiO1chjquXF8k7wO3vflXEw87oXXk-", "site_full": "gophouse.org", "site": "gophouse.org", "site_section": "http://gophouse.org/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Michigan House Republicans", "title": "Rep.

Patients sometimes are transported to hospitals by air ambulance without it being necessary and are eventually slammed with outrageous medical bills. \u201cTo protect patients from being hit hard with air ambulance bills costing in the tens of thousands of dollars, this bill stresses ground ambulance transportation over air,\u201d said Bellino. \u201cToo many patients have gone into debt because of air ambulance medical costs.\u201d Air ambulance companies currently participate in \u201cbalance billing\u201d where the patient\u2019s health care provider will pay for a portion of the bill, but not its entirety. This leaves patients with medical bills in the tens of thousands of dollars. \u201cIn a case in which an air ambulance is requested, hospitals should order an air transport vehicle from a participating provider with the nonemergency patient\u2019s health benefit plan to help avoid huge billing costs,\u201d Bellino said. \u201cI am happy my colleagues in the House voted in favor of protecting patients.

them, I'd normally suggest to them to find something that they would find enjoyment in doing. However, in your specific case, it appears that doing that (like the medical field) would be problematic based on your hand tremors. I would suggest looking more into what type of careers would suit you. (Such as careers that work well for people with shakey hands, there's bound to be something on the internet, or take a career test! [Yes, some of these can be utterly useless, but some can be eye opening]).\nSee if you can find a job that combines what you want and need, or if there's a job availability that would be willing to accomodate the need that you have.\nIf keeping a higher salary isn't as much of a need to you, then you could focus on volunteer hours at an animal shelter or similar. However, if feeling like you have a product from your efforts is essential to you personally, (like it is for many), ie a salary, then I would go on the route of trying to find something that works.\nDon't force yourself into something that you find no personal want in, however, unless it is a need (ie financially). doing so may only make you feel more lost. Even the small steps can help get you to a place where you love what you are doing. For example, if by searching amongst other career opertunities you find interest in something that you have never heard of before, then you're already one step ahead than you would be working a job that you don't like.\nSome possible ideas:\nIf you wouldn't mind helping to guide the next generation, teach a medical based class at a highschool or university.\nIf you don't feel the need to hold a paying job, maybe you could become a foster home for animals and care for them.\nIf you are willing to put in the effort, create and run business or non-profit organization based around helping those in the medical field.\nIf you have a creative mind, invent a product that would help improve the lives of animals, and find investors to back you.\n(some of these ideas were created without full knowledge of how serious your hand tremors were)\nReally, it comes down to your circumstances and what you aim to do. If your husband's offer of running his company doesn't interest you, don't feel obligated to take it. It isn't uncommon to need to try out different things before knowing that they will or won't work out for you. Hope that this helps.\nEdit: You don't necessarily need to ask your husband for money to go back to school. Instead, you could take out your own loan if what you planned on going for had a promising outlook, and pay if off yourself if you felt like it would be too reliant.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:36.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "63c4f2ec1111bad32fec1eaacae3e31dd0ab64ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRQJDZcqmWO6xgUfHXQSbeDKIWfD6ilHJY8oKp6KNrWinscczHhc.4c", "site_full": "calvinsdad.livejournal.com", "site": "livejournal.com", "site_section": "https://calvinsdad.livejournal.com/data/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Comics Casserole", "title": "Everything December 6th", "title_full": "Everything December 6th", "published": "2017-12-06T17:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/sign.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "63c4f2ec1111bad32fec1eaacae3e31dd0ab64ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRQJDZcqmWO6xgUfHXQSbeDKIWfD6ilHJY8oKp6KNrWinscczHhc.4c", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T17:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "Everything December 6th", "text": "BCN: The missing poster at the end got a chuckle out of me .Mythica: I finally found a new artist when the old one (Fabio) realized that even after a month haitus, he was still too swamped with work to help me.

This article will provide you with excellent tips on how to pair wine and food together and when to serve what. It may take a little learning and practice to figure out, but it will be well worth the effort.\nIf you\u2019re having seafood, go with Pinot Grigio. This wine draws out the food\u2019s flavor. Ocean dishes are also complemented by other white wines. recommended you read is sure to please even the most discriminating food critic.\nA great tip if you\u2019re interested in buying wine is not to get too carried away with buying a lot of wine that you currently like. Tastes change all the time, and you might regret packing your wine cellar with a bunch of wine that you happen to like right now.\nOne good thing to do when you\u2019re getting wine is to give a single a bottle a try first. With such a variety of wines to chose from, you need to find out which ones you actually like. Always try a bottle before opting to purchase a case.\nTry one of the many discussion forums about wine online. There are some great ones out there, and they are a wonderful place to interact with others and get ideas on which wines are worth exploring. Be sure you do look at the rules of the forum and what it\u2019s like before joining.\nIf you are a wine newbie and you are looking for a wine to try, why not go to a wine tasting? At these events, you can taste many different wines until you find one the best suits your taste. Also, if you find one you like, you can usually purchase a bottle at the same time.\nA good tip if you\u2019re interested in learning more about wines is to simply do your homework on them. Do as much reading as you can about wines and the industry, and before you know it, you\u2019ll be the most knowledgeable person about wines among all of your friends.\n\nhttp://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2017/11/michigans_best_stops_in_ann_ar_1.html want to serve white wines at about forty five degrees for the best taste. Whenever you drink these wines at room temperature, it\u2019s not possible to enjoy the complete flavor that they can provide. Put champagne in the fridge for at least an hour prior to drinking.\nTake notes on any wine that you try out. You aren\u2019t going to really know what you are doing at first. However, over time, you will start noticing specific trends in your notes and reactions. You might even see that your reaction to particular wine\u2019s changes as you drink more of them.\nIf you wish to get a wine that\u2019s lighter, don\u2019t pay attention to color. White wine contains the same percentage of alcohol as red wine. That said, white wines tend to be smoother and easier to drink. Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio are the lightest options available, so consider them for your table.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to try something new. Once a particular wine catches on with the public, it is often found in mass on the market. It can be hard to find a good wine when there are so many sub-par labels on the shelves. To combat this problem, try wine from lesser known regions. You may be surprised at the quality.\nYou can read as much as you like about wine, but ultimately, you have to decide for yourself if you like it or not. Price often doesn\u2019t matter. You may like an inexpensive bottle of red wine much more than a costlier version. Don\u2019t apologize for your tastes. Drink what you enjoy.\nAlways smell your wine before you taste it. One reason is that it could be spoiled, which can be easily identified by smelling it, which could save you from getting sick. Additionally, you can also learn a lot about the wine from its aroma, and if you stick with this habit you will begin to identify how over time.\nWhen you first get a glass of wine, look at its color. This will tell you all about what the wine will taste like. Aged white wine gets darker and stronger. Aged red wine actually fades in color. How the wine has been aged and which grapes were used will also affect the color.\nSpilled some red wine on your gorgeous white linen tablecloth? The first step is to pour soda water on the spot. No soda water on hand? White wine will do. Blot it with a paper towel to soak up the liquid, then wash it in bleach and cold water to get the stain out.\nBecoming a wine expert is no easy feat, and it doesn\u2019t happen overnight. However, if you use the advice mentioned in the article above, you are well on your way of becoming a wine connoisseur in your own right. Just remember to have fun during your wine education and be sure to drink responsibly.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sauvignon blanc", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:36.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe871a0a5181bf0c224c611446dc70993bbbe972", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSC4DF4x34E0vmLxx7R60Kv4rUhCRjs5jHAVZx0RLtPj1xg55KTua1izvBcfF._OpYR_oGSk7tY1HiarH2g1EiGz7u_M55sPVFAdimozDoCUw--", "site_full": "albuquerque.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://albuquerque.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist albuquerque | for sale search", "title": "''VICTORIA'' IMPERIAL SILVERPLATE FLATWARE", "title_full": "''VICTORIA'' IMPERIAL SILVERPLATE FLATWARE", "published": "2017-12-07T10:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/00707_2fnaeRspAKZ_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fe871a0a5181bf0c224c611446dc70993bbbe972", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSC4DF4x34E0vmLxx7R60Kv4rUhCRjs5jHAVZx0RLtPj1xg55KTua1izvBcfF._OpYR_oGSk7tY1HiarH2g1EiGz7u_M55sPVFAdimozDoCUw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "''VICTORIA'' IMPERIAL SILVERPLATE FLATWARE", "text": "make / manufacturer: IMPERIAL BY ROGERS model name / number: VICTORIA QR Code Link to This Post 52 PIECE SILVERPLATE BEAUTIFULVINTAGE FLATWARE.. .EXCELLENT CONDITION..

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) Share story LORNE COOK The Associated Press \nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Ireland expects the U.K. to make a new Brexit proposal by Friday as officials in London struggle to resolve issues surrounding the Irish border that are stalling talks over Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure to persuade EU leaders to declare that sufficient progress has been made on divorce issues with the EU, including the Irish border, when they meet next week in Brussels so talks can move on to trade and future relations between the two sides. Business leaders warn further delays will hurt companies as they plan for the future. \nIreland\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said late Wednesday that he hopes May will submit a new offer \u201ctonight or tomorrow.\u201d Disagreements over rules governing the border between the Republic of Ireland, which is a member of the EU, and the U.K. province of Northern Ireland derailed an earlier proposal. \nExisting rules allow people and goods to pass freely between the Republic and Northern Ireland with no border checks. Ireland wants to preserve the current arrangement, which has eased tensions along the border. May is struggling to balance those demands against the concerns of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to support her government in Parliament.
