To make the right choice of a puppy, you need to be informed regarding not only the puppy but also the breeders. That is why reading the tips below are essential for you. They will make it easy for you to locate the best Hampion Labrador retriever puppies for sale.\n\nThe seller plays a crucial role in determining the kind of animal you will have. When you purchase from sellers who have no idea about dog breeding, then they will not be able to advise you on the type of pets that they have. Buying from a breeder gives you a wide range of selection and you can tell them to sell you the animals you want and not only what they have.\n\nCheck the behavior of a pup before buying it. It is crucial to know that people have different personalities. It is wise to purchase a pet that you will feel comfortable with. One way to achieve this is to check the pet when at young stage. Also, you can ask the seller or the breeder regarding the behavior of its parents. This will enable you to be sure that the pet will be compatible in your life.\n\nInquire the store owner to provide you with credentials. It is only by checking the credentials that you can confirm whether the breeder is permitted to sell the pups. Also, it will help you get away from scam sellers and those who sell stolen dogs. There are cunning guys who will who will give you forged papers. Therefore, be vigilant and check whether they are legitimate.\n\nAsk people about what they think of the breeder. People think differently regarding various pet stores. By asking folks around the area, you are likely to find that the person they believe has the type of animals you need. A good reputation means that folks believe that the person is legitimate and that they offer better services than others in a particular area.\n\nVisit the place where they keep the pups. This will helps you to know whether the animals are kept in a clean environment. You do not want to buy a pet only to get sick a few days after paying for it. Also, they will give you a chance to observe other pets and see whether there is another one that catches your attention.\n\nReflect on the price. No one likes to spend more than they should. It is painful when they acquire a poor breed of a pet at expensive price. One thing that could contribute to this is if you go to a store when you are not prepared. It is sensible that you search for information about various breeds, characteristics and the prices. This can enable you to avoid making errors which might cost you your money.\n\nIt is now confirmed beyond doubt that buying the puppy from anyone you find is a huge blunder. As well, you can see that pets have different personalities and thus you must choose wisely to avoid selecting the one that will not fit in your family.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are looking for information about hampion Labrador Retriever puppies , pay a visit to our web pages today.

Khalil Hamra AP Photo Palestinians burn a poster of U.S. President Donald Trump and a representation of an American flag, during a protest against the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, in Gaza City Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017. Khalil Hamra AP Photo Palestinians protest Trump move on Jerusalem By ILAN BEN ZION Associated Press December 07, 2017 07:47 AM UPDATED 3 MINUTES AGO JERUSALEM \nHundreds of Palestinian protesters clashed with Israeli troops across the West Bank on Thursday while demonstrators in Gaza burned posters of President Donald Trump over his widely denounced decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. \nThe leader of the Hamas militant group, which runs Gaza, called for a new armed uprising in a widespread show of anger, as the demonstrators torched American and Israeli flags. \nIn the West Bank, crowds of protesters set tires on fire and hurled stones at Israeli troops. In Bethlehem, troops fired water cannons and tear gas to disperse a crowd, in clashes that could cloud the upcoming Christmas celebrations in the town of Jesus' birth. In Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian government, protesters set tires on fire, sending a thick plume of black smoke over the city. \nTrump's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. The Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital.   \nPalestinians shuttered their schools and shops on Thursday to begin three \"days of rage\" over Trump's decision. Rallies were underway in other West Bank cities, and a demonstration was being held outside the Damascus Gate of Jerusalem's Old City. \n\"We are here. We believe in our rights,\" said Rania Hatem, a protester outside the Old City. \nPalestinian officials said dozens of protesters were lightly wounded, most from tear gas inhalation. Friday, the Muslim holy day when Palestinians gather for weekly mass prayers, could prove more violent. \nIn the Gaza Strip, Hamas' leader Ismail Haniyeh called on Palestinians to launch a new intifada, or uprising, against Israel on Friday. \n\"The American decision is an aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries,\" Haniyeh said in a speech, urging supporters \"to be ready for any orders.\" \n\"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision,\" he said. \nHamas, a group that seeks Israel's destruction, killed hundreds of Israelis in suicide bombings and other attacks in the early 2000s. But the group's capabilities are more limited now. Gaza, Hamas' stronghold, is closed by an Israeli blockade, while in the West Bank, many of its members have been arrested. Nonetheless, it possesses a large arsenal of rockets in Gaza capable of striking much of Israel. \nThe Israeli military said it would deploy several battalions to the West Bank ahead of Friday, while other troops have been put on alert to address \"possible developments.\" \nThe conflicting claims to Jerusalem, and especially its Old City, where sensitive Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites are located, lie at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While Trump's decision had no impact on the city's daily life, it carried deep symbolic meaning, and was seen as an attempt to impose a solution on the Palestinians. \nIsrael, which claims all of Jerusalem as its undivided capital, has welcomed Trump's decision. Netanyahu said Trump \"bound himself forever\" to the history of Jerusalem with the move and claimed other states are considering following suit. \n\"We are already in contact with other states that will make a similar recognition,\" he said Thursday. \nAnger at the U.S. has rippled across the Arab world. \nSaudi Arabia's royal court condemned the Trump administration's decision in a rare public rebuke by the U.S. ally. The regional powerhouse, which could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said Thursday it had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\" \nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who leads Trump's efforts to restart Mideast peace talks. \nU.S. embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa warned American citizens of possible protests following Trump's move. \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has suggested that with Trump's move, the United States disqualified itself as mediator, a role it has played exclusively in more than two decades of stop-and-go negotiations aimed at setting up a Palestinian state alongside Israel. \nThe stalled talks have failed to bring the Palestinians closer to the state they seek in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel has meanwhile steadily expanded Jewish settlements on war-won lands, even as it said it wants to negotiate. \nTrump's claim Wednesday that he still wants to pursue what he has called the \"ultimate\" deal was met by mounting skepticism. \n\"With its decision, the U.S. has isolated itself and Israel, and has pushed the area into a dangerous situation and stopped the peace process,\" said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a senior Abbas aide. \nAt a meeting Thursday with his closest Arab ally, Jordan's King Abdullah II, Abbas said he is rallying international opposition to Trump's decision, which he called \"an unacceptable crime.\" \nJordan, alongside other U.S. allies in the region, has slammed Trump's decision on Jerusalem. The king is seen as one of Washington's most dependable partners in the battle against Islamic extremism in the region. \nAt the same time, the legitimacy of his Hashemite dynasty is closely linked to its special role as religious guardian of a major Muslim shrine in east Jerusalem. Jordan, which has a large population with Palestinian roots, cannot afford to be seen as soft on Muslim claims to the holy city. \nThe European Union's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said Trump's announcement \"has the potential to send us backwards to even darker times than the one we are already living in.\" \nThe Arab League, a group representing most states in the Middle East and North Africa, will meet Saturday. Next week, Turkey will host a gathering of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which has 57 member states. \nThe region has been bracing for fallout from Trump's seismic policy shift. \nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday accused Trump of throwing the Mideast into a \"ring of fire\" and said his motives were difficult to fathom. \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it,\" Erdogan said, referring to Trump in a speech to a group of workers at Ankara's airport.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "abdullah ii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recep tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karin laub", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oded balilty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammad bin salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmoud abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nabil abu rdeneh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ilan ben zion associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "organization of islamic cooperation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arab league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "old city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaza strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:38.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e5273c34033334fb1191c4010f54072e6bd20c5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpQVKkNlsZ2tisOakBCyk0krHFXRmgL9uO8R8mreqINovHi6Qt.W2cKXcDfNVst37HFFFNdIsFw6MDZzX84iWmnUW_Fgd0qNn6k-", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual?page=3", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals - page 3", "title": "itek Bluetooth Disco Ball Speaker (was \u00a339) Now \u00a39.99 C&C at Very", "title_full": "itek Bluetooth Disco Ball Speaker (was \u00a339) Now \u00a39.99 C&C at Very - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-05T05:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2847919_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a473722ab030f0b1b8759f6a8cb3e32f89c450d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpQVKkNlsZ2tisOakBCyk0krHFXRmgL9uO8R8mreqINovHi6Qt.W2cKXcDfNVst37HFFFNdIsFw6MDZzX84iWmnUHSYYtIS1k4fWVfz99DWM4jTzSR1nc1X.", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "webhose.io", "published": "2017-12-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Bought !

Up until then, it had been my role to challenge the powers that be, to shake the status quo at its very foundation, to deliberate, dissect, and disgrace those involved with the task of educating my children. It was quite satisfying to know that my wife was equally up to the challenge.\n\u201cThat was quite impressive.\u201d, I continued as we walked to the car.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d, she responded. \u201cI had an excellent teacher.\u201d\n\u201cWell, its nice to know you were paying attention.\u201d, I said.\n\u201cDo you really think that after all these years of listening to you that something wouldn\u2019t have rubbed off?\u201d, she asked.\nThe phone call we received the next day came as no surprise. The school administration, including the school\u2019s Superintendent, had requested a meeting with us to discuss several concerns related to our kids. It did not sit well with my wife.\n\u201cConcerns with our kids?\u201d, she ranted. \u201cAre they out of their minds?\u201d\n\u201cThey are.\u201d, I confirmed. \u201cBut you have to try to relax. We have to go in calm and seemingly rational, no matter how pissed we are. Never let them know what we are thinking.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d, she said.\n\u201cYep.\u201d, I replied. \u201cWords to live by from Vito Colerone.\u201d\nThe meeting was more of a lynching, with 6 school and board personnel present, armed with files, and reports. They positioned themselves at one end of the table, so that my wife and I were forced to sit at the opposite end, looking like guilty school children. \u201cHave a seat, please.\u201d, the principal stated.\n\u201cI think I\u2019d prefer to stand.\u201d, I responded., as my wife sat down in her assigned seat. \u201cWhat I have to say really won\u2019t take very long.\u201d\n\u201cHowever we have a rather lengthy list of concerns regarding your children.\u201d, the Superintendent spouted.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you do.\u201d, I replied. \u201cBut I really have no interest in hearing any of them. So, I understand that the teacher who had manhandled my daughter is still teaching in the school.\u201d\n\u201cWe have finished our investigation into the matter, and we don\u2019t believe there is any need for further disciplinary measures.\u201d, he answered.\n\u201cWell\u201d, I said as I put my hand on my wife\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there is any need to continue this meeting.\u201d, I stated as my wife stood up.\n\u201cJust a minute.\u201d, the Superintendent said. \u201cThere are issues here we need to address.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d, I replied. \u201cDid I not make it clear that we really don\u2019t give a shit about what you think?\u201d.\n\u201cWell\u201d, he continued. \u201cNow we see why the children have so many behavioral issues.\u201d\n\u201cHell no.\u201d, I corrected him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen anything yet. I suggested you contact your superior, and have yourself, the principal of this school, the teacher and the Board of Education obtain legal counsel. I have secured a human rights attorney who is, as we speak, presenting a motion to bar Ms. Emmerson from teaching until a full and complete inquiry has been completed. As well, criminal charges for assault, and child abuse are being laid against this deranged woman. And the rest of you who were aware of the issues we raised, and did nothing, have been named in a civil law suit, as has the board. Papers should be served to all of you within the next 72 hours.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re going to get out of this.\u201d, the Superintendent questioned.\n\u201cOh.\u201d, I reported, \u201cI almost forgot. You may want to watch the 6 o\u2019clock news tonight. Doesn\u2019t matter which network. They are all airing this story. As to what I think I\u2019m going to get out of this, well, your fucking jobs. Your careers, and your reputations.\u201d\nThe silence that fell on the room was deafening. The Superintendent finally spoke. \u201cCan I speak with you outside?\u201d My wife and I joined him in the hallway, just outside of the school Principal\u2019s office. \u201cDon\u2019t you think this can be rectified in some other way?\u201d\n\u201cThat ship has sailed.\u201d, I replied. \u201cWe spoke several times, and you informed me every time that there were no grounds for any disciplinary action. You blamed my daughter, and justified the teacher\u2019s actions. And so, now, you\u2019re all fucked. Get Ms. Emmerson out of my kid\u2019s school, and I will consider withdrawing the legal proceedings. Can I be frank with you?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d, he said.\n\u201cDo yourself a favor.\u201d, I told him. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with my family. We will take you down.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that was pretty amazing.\u201d, my wife said to me in the car. \u201cHow did you arrange all of that stuff.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d, I told her. \u201cMy friend Jerod is a lawyer. He\u2019s drafting some letters, but now we wait to see what they do with our offer. They can transfer her wherever we don\u2019t have kids.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the news casts tonight?\u201d, she asked. \u201cIf they watch and its not on, they\u2019ll know we\u2019re full of shit.\u201d\n\u201cIt will be on.\u201d, I assured her. \u201cThat I was able to arrange through Jerod. All three networks will air a report on a child being assaulted by a teacher and how the school and the board swept it under the rug.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty sexy when you\u2019re devious.\u201d, she said.\nIn less than 24 hours, we received an email stating that effective immediately, Ms. Emmerson had been removed from the staff at my kid\u2019s school, and transferred to another school at the far end of the school district. A formal letter from the school board arrived several days later, with a full and complete apology from the Board.\nThings changed at my kid\u2019s school. My kids seemed happier, and we no longer received phone calls about nonsense. When we did attend planning meetings for our kid\u2019s, our ideas and recommendations were included in the plan. We never saw Ms. Emmerson again, and a few months later, the school principal disappeared. I told my wife that I had nothing to do with it, but I\u2019m not sure if she believed me. My wife decided to become active in the PTA, and wound up being president. Me, well, I took satisfaction in knowing that my dream of being a Mafia enforcer had come true, and that I could easily turn my wife on by behaving like a character from Goodfellas.\n \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vito colerone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerod", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "board of education", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:38.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e5273c34033334fb1191c4010f54072e6bd20c5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpQVKkNlsZ2tisOakBCyk0krHFXRmgL9uO8R8mreqINovHi6Qt.W2cKXcDfNVst37HFFFNdIsFw6MDZzX84iWmnUW_Fgd0qNn6k-", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual?page=3", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK -

(Victoria Jones/PA) \nAt the centre of the ring is a large diamond from Botswana, a country that holds special significance for Harry who has visited many times since he was a child. \nBut Stephen Connelly, director of Cleave and Company Court Jewellers and Medallists to Her Majesty The Queen, who were commissioned to make the ring, said the intense media attention has been \u201ca bit of a shock\u201d. \nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be making replicas of it. If you want a ring, then we\u2019ll design you a different one.\u201d \nDavid Thomas, a former Crown Jeweller who looked after the royal family\u2019s jewels and now works with Cleave and Company, said working on the ring was the \u201cbiggest and hardest secret\u201d he\u2019s had to keep in his life. \nHe said he has been bombarded by questions from the press \u2013 including how much the ring had cost \u2013 but declined to violate the royal couple\u2019s privacy. \n\u201cJewellers are like doctors: we never discuss our patients,\u201d Mr Thomas said. \nHarry is not the only royal to design his bride-to-be\u2019s engagement ring using jewels that belonged to his mother. \nThe Duke of Edinburgh designed an engagement ring for the Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, in 1947. \nThe Duke had the ring made by the jewellers Philip Antrobus Ltd, using diamonds from a tiara belonging to his mother, Princess Alice of Greece. \nWhen Prince William proposed to Kate Middleton, now the Duchess of Cambridge, he gave her Diana\u2019s famous sapphire and diamond engagement ring.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "meghan markle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prince harry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kate middleton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominic lipinski/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria jones/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen connelly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cleave and company court jewellers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip antrobus ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleave and company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duke", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "botswana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:38.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e5273c34033334fb1191c4010f54072e6bd20c5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpQVKkNlsZ2tisOakBCyk0krHFXRmgL9uO8R8mreqINovHi6Qt.W2cKXcDfNVst37HFFFNdIsFw6MDZzX84iWmnUW_Fgd0qNn6k-", "site_full": "www.hotukdeals.com", "site": "hotukdeals.com", "site_section": "https://www.hotukdeals.com/tag/audiovisual?page=3", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Audiovisual Deals \u21d2 Cheap price, best Sale in UK - HotUKDeals - page 3", "title": "itek Bluetooth Disco Ball Speaker (was \u00a339) Now \u00a39.99 C&C at Very", "title_full": "itek Bluetooth Disco Ball Speaker (was \u00a339) Now \u00a39.99 C&C at Very - HotUKDeals", "published": "2017-12-05T05:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.hotukdeals.com/threads/thread_full_screen/default/2847919_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1864, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "04feee3470e163fc618d7dbb37e6d6b9ab437e9e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbOuB4rmv96rSQeWuYMKY.lrLKR4UZOpQVKkNlsZ2tisOakBCyk0krHFXRmgL9uO8R8mreqINovHi6Qt.W2cKXcDfNVst37HFFFNdIsFw6MDZzX84iWmnUHSYYtIS1k4fWVfz99DWM4hzNhxCg_H3J", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "webhose.io", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "This seems like cheap tat i was going to purchase until i scrolled down", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:38.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4fa0e46724b6e448978fbcd8e24c5fdca55216c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog6_8ATcbWgqoFTYhNWHVqlgIbbuTBVRa.mq8n_jDNdRsDxaBluqbambjdHVn_EJVPven.wBMWXk6QpTgdEnYm0KKfWoQHp5_uURL2nwOpHoC5NqVRADxAPA8-", "site_full": "community.babycentre.co.uk", "site": "babycentre.co.uk", "site_section": "http://community.babycentre.co.uk/groups/a3814175/the-no-cry-sleep-solution&siteSource=classic-loginTop&brandChannel=community&pageName=Group+%7C+The+No-Cry+Sleep+Solution+%7C+Group+Page", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "The No-Cry Sleep Solution - BabyCentre", "title": "OT - applying for child benefit & child tax credit advice?

Meta Viers McClatchy Wildfire destroys mobile homes in California retirement park By ELIOT SPAGAT and AMANDA LEE MYERS Associated Press December 07, 2017 05:42 PM SAN DIEGO \nA brush fire driven by gusty winds that have plagued Southern California all week exploded rapidly Thursday and destroyed dozens of trailer homes in a retirement community north of San Diego. \nThe fire expanded to 4 square miles (10 square kilometers) in a matter of hours and tore through the tightly packed Rancho Monserate Country Club community in the small city of Fallbrook, known for its avocado orchards and horse ranches. At least two people were hospitalized with burns. \nThe destructive blaze broke out as firefighters were trying to corral major wildfires around the Los Angeles area and 130 miles (209 kilometers) north near Ventura, where a massive fire threatened Ojai, a scenic mountain town dubbed \"Shangri-La\" and known for its boutique hotels and New Age spiritual retreats. \nLike other fires that have broken out this week, Fallbrook has a history of destructive blazes. Ten years ago, as fall fires raced across Southern California, a blaze in Fallbrook injured five people, destroyed 206 homes and burned 14 square miles (36 square kilometers).   \nThursday's fire prompted closure of state Highway 76 in both directions and evacuations in an area near the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base. Evacuation centers were set up in schools and casinos.

The British Embassy to Israel is based in Tel Aviv and we have no plans to move it. Theresa May said Mr Trump\u2019s decision was unhelpful (Matt Dunham/PA) \n\u201cOur position on the status of Jerusalem is clear and long-standing: it should be determined in a negotiated settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and Jerusalem should ultimately be the shared capital of the Israeli and Palestinian states. \n\u201cIn line with relevant Security Council Resolutions, we regard East Jerusalem as part of the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\u201d \nMr Corbyn tweeted: \u201cTrump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, including occupied Palestinian territory, is a reckless threat to peace. \n\u201cThe British Government must condemn this dangerous act and work for a just and viable settlement of the conflict.\u201d \nJerusalem: for the first time in all the long years of the American century we now have in the White House a reckless and ignorant American President. The world is an even more dangerous place tonight. \n\u2014 Paddy Ashdown (@paddyashdown) December 6, 2017 \nMrs May said Britain shares Mr Trump\u2019s desire to end the Israel-Palestine conflict and welcomed his commitment to a negotiated two state solution. \nShe also \u201cnoted the importance\u201d of his acknowledgement that the final status of Jerusalem, including the sovereign boundaries within the city, should be subject to negotiations. \n\u201cWe encourage the US administration to now bring forward detailed proposals for an Israel-Palestinian settlement,\u201d she added. \n\u201cTo have the best chances of success, the peace process must be conducted in an atmosphere free from violence. We call on all parties to work together to maintain calm.\u201d \nI have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

I smoked my last cigarette 2 hours ago...and determined to stay strong! I've never posted on a community blog before...but I'm wanting to step out of my secret smoking and get the support I need!

He\u2019s someone that most all of you will definitely be familiar with. When I was about five or six years old, and just beginning to become invested in sports (bad decision, buddy), the first team I latched onto was the N.C. State Wolfpack. As a kid from Raleigh, and given that my Mom went there, it was something that was kind of pushed on me, but I loved them. I went all in on them so, so young. Oops. When I was that age, the football team there had this quarterback. His name was Philip Rivers, and he was my hero. I adored him. Some of my earliest and best sports memories are of that 28-6 Gator Bowl win over Notre Dame in 2002 and watching Rivers and wide receiver Jericho Cotchery walk off the field together for the final time at the tail end of a complete demolition of Kansas in the Tangerine Bowl. On his draft day in 2004, I was very briefly a Giants fan, before ultimately pledging loyalty to the then-San Diego Chargers for as long as he was there when he got traded. Throughout his NFL career, and as it nears its end, I\u2019ve begun to liken Rivers to Sisyphus. I\u2019m sure you all know the legend. In Greek mythology, Sisyphus is the one who is eternally doomed to push a boulder all the way up a hill, only to watch it roll all the way back down as he nears the top. Again, and again, and again, and again. That\u2019s what it\u2019s been like watching Rivers come so close with some really good Chargers teams, and it\u2019s what it\u2019s been like watching him drag some truly dreadful Chargers teams toward wholly undeserved relevancy. The reason I bring this up is because it\u2019s starting to feel as though, just like the guy who played his college ball a stone\u2019s throw from the Entertainment and Sports Arena, that building\u2019s professional inhabitants are the NHL franchise embodiment of Sisyphus. Oh, you just had an emotional, pick-me-up win at home against Florida? You want to use that to build momentum and turn your season around? Nope, you\u2019re getting blanked by Vancouver next game. Oh yeah, and it\u2019s by Jacob Markstrom , the guy who was tantalizingly close to setting the record for most NHL starts without a shutout. You just traded for and signed your next starting goalie for four years? Well, he\u2019s gonna show flashes of brilliance, but he\u2019s going to have a really tough time settling into his new role. That 13-game point streak you had last year to almost make the playoffs? Yeah, that momentum is going to carry over to next year not at all. Oh, and it was just smoke and mirrors anyway. Take a look at that 104 PDO during that stretch. On, and on, and on, and on, and on. Usually what I do in this column is break down advanced stats to find some positives in what the team is doing. It\u2019s pretty easy, and it\u2019s because those charts, graphs, and tables are one area where this team has no trouble whatsoever appearing to be really, really good. Related By the Numbers: Noah Hanifin is Actually Good It never translates to the standings though. And this isn\u2019t to say that advanced stats aren\u2019t incredibly useful and very predictive. There are 30 teams in this league I\u2019m willing to judge by their underlying numbers, but that number won\u2019t go back up to 31 until there\u2019s a reason for it to. I don\u2019t have answers as to why this team still isn\u2019t good, and nobody else seems to either. Maybe the coach\u2019s system is one that looks good by some metrics but isn\u2019t conducive to winning games. Maybe it\u2019s a good system executed by players who don\u2019t have the talent to consistently win with it. Maybe it\u2019s a system that makes things hard on goaltenders in a way that doesn\u2019t show up in advanced stats. It could be any of these things, along with many other possibilities, and there seems to be no way of knowing for sure. Maybe they actually are as good as some numbers say they are and it\u2019s just a matter of time before things start to click, but I\u2019m not very confident in that at this point. I\u2019m not sure what the path to making this a playoff team looks like, but I feel pretty comfortable in saying the one they\u2019re on right now is not it. I also understand that the moves that might need to be made to get there are incredibly difficult to make. I would hope attempts are being made. I would hope the front office knows that a season of the same issues and same results is not acceptable after such a promising off-season. The clock is ticking. This team has quite a few good, young players who are either just entering their prime or coming close to doing so. Yeah, they have a few years, but they also can\u2019t afford to waste years full of what-ifs and if-onlys. But something needs to change. Whether that\u2019s a significant piece or portion of the roster, something relating to the culture, something in the front office, or something with the men standing behind that bench every night, I have no idea. Whether they make a big change or not, maybe it won\u2019t be enough. Maybe this team will forever be too good to have a top pick but not good enough to make the playoffs. But maybe they\u2019ll finally get that boulder over that hill. I know a lot of people who would love to see that.

Ivan Sekretarev AP Photo Russian ex-minister gives final argument in corruption trial By NATALIYA VASILYEVA Associated Press December 07, 2017 02:06 AM UPDATED 4 MINUTES AGO MOSCOW \nWrapping up one of Russia's most high-profile trials of the year, a former economic development minister charged with bribery on Thursday accused an oil executive of setting him up and apologized for \"turning back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nAlexei Ulyukayev, the highest-ranking Russian official to be arrested since 1993, was detained last year at the headquarters of Russia's largest oil producer, the state-owned Rosneft, after a sting operation by Russia's main intelligence agency. Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. \nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up.   SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. \nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared \u2014 what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\" \nUlyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. \nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop. \nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev's actions \"are undermining the authority of the government.\" \nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \"those absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised. I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts.

Recent Stories FAT Brands Starts Strong on Nasdaq \nOn a side street off Times Square brokers and traders lined up earlier this week for a rare treat outside of Nasdaq\u2019s Manhattan market center: free Fatburgers. Mark Elenowitz, the investment banker behind the $24 million Regulation A capital raise of FAT Brands, was glowing with pride. FAT Brands opening IPO day was here and market interest had driven the stock to open above the $12 Reg A offer price. The first trade sold at $12.80 and the stock soared to $13.99 in the morning hours. Elenowitz and his team at Tripoint Global Equities had worked all weekend to ensure the 2 million shares sold cleared the DTC (Depository Trust Company) and the hundreds of retail investors who bought stock through Tripoint\u2019s online crowdfunding portal, BANQ, had their shares in their retail accounts available to trade immediately. FAT Brands is controlled by Andy Wiederhorn, head of the investment firm Fog Cutter Capital Group. The Southern California burger joint Fatburger, often touted by Hollywood celebrities, was started by Lovie Yancey and Charles Simpson. Yancey first opened a three-seater burger stand in the late 1940s in front of her house in South Central Los Angeles. FAT Brands, which stands for Fresh-Authentic-Tasty, owns multiple franchise chains focused on American food served in a fast casual setting. Fatburger is a 65-year-old company fashioned as a self-serve burger joint that competes with In-n-Out and Shake Shack (SHAK). Buffalo\u2019s Caf\u00e9 was founded in Roswell, Ga. in 1985, and is known for its chicken wings with 13 different sauces. And the company\u2019s newest acquisition, Ponderosa and Bonanza Steakhouse, is a chain started in 1963 by Dan Blocker, who was known for his role as Hoss Cartwright in the TV western series Bonanza.

FAT Brands Readies Close of $24M APO \nFast-casual dining franchise company FAT Brands expects to close it\u2019s $24 million Reg A offering as soon as Oct. 20, according to company insiders. The quick closing follows reports that the company attracted millions of committed capital on its first day after the Securities and Exchange Commission qualified the offering on October 3. The owner of Fatburger and Buffalo\u2019s Caf\u00e9 is selling two million shares at $12, with a minimum investment of $500, from institutional and retail investors. The deal is being sold by Tripoint Global Securities as the exclusive bookrunner.

The Charlotte Observer via AP Diedra Laird Cyberattack slows North Carolina county as it works on fixes By TOM FOREMAN Jr. and JONATHAN DREW Associated Press December 07, 2017 02:48 PM UPDATED 1 MINUTE AGO CHARLOTTE, N.C. \nTime-consuming paper transactions slowed business Thursday in North Carolina's largest metro area as a county government began the long process of restoring computer systems locked down by a ransomware attack. \nMecklenburg County was using backed-up data to make digital repairs after refusing to pay foreign hackers that froze dozens of county servers earlier this week. County officials were also taking new precautions against fraudulent emails because the hackers have tried again to penetrate their computers. No further damage to the system was reported. \nIn the meantime, services ranging from processing jail inmates to paying tax bills had to be done by hand. \nDarryl Broome, a contractor who does remodeling and demolition work, went in person to a county office to retrieve land information he normally could look up on his home computer. He had to drive 10 miles and spent about a half-hour looking through paper records. Never miss a local story.

SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"It's a bit frustrating because you learn that you really need certain things online,\" he said. \"You get used to doing certain things online, and when you have to slow down, it costs you time and time costs you money.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government said its separate computer system wasn't affected by the attack. Nor were the computers that handle 911 calls and dispatch for the city and county, said Charlotte Fire Department Deputy Chief Richard Granger. \nMecklenburg County manager Dina Diorio told staff in an email Thursday that the county was disabling employees' ability to open attachments generated through Dropbox and Google Docs because of renewed attacks. \nShe said that because the county refused to pay ransom, \"the cyber criminals are redoubling their efforts to penetrate the County's systems, primarily through emails that contain fraudulent attachments with viruses that could further damage our systems.\" \nMany county-run services have been delayed, and officials say it will take days to repair damage from the initial attack. The sheriff has said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, while code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nCyberattacks on local government are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated. Security experts say Mecklenburg County followed the right steps before and after the cyberattack, including declining to pay the ransom. \n\"Unfortunately, it's become all too common,\" said Lawrence Abrams, who runs the cyber security site bleepingcomputer.com. \"It's smart not to pay the ransom if you can avoid it. In paying these ransoms, it's obviously encouraging others.\" \nCounties in Indiana and Alabama are among those that have paid to regain access to data frozen by cyberattacks since late last year. The Montgomery Advertiser reported that Montgomery County, Alabama, faced disruptions to some operations even after paying hackers in September. \nOther public organizations have chosen to rebuild instead of paying hackers. In November 2016, a ransomware attack on San Francisco's transit system resulted in officials shutting down ticketing machines, allowing free rides for much of a weekend. But transit officials didn't pay a ransom. The St. Louis library system said it took days to restore electronic services for patrons and weeks more to fix all of its computers after it refused to pay hackers behind a ransomware attack this year. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said Mecklenburg County appears to have done a good job of backing up its data if it's able to restore the system without paying the hackers. \n\"It seems like the county was fairly well-prepared,\" he said. \"Overall, this is not as bad of a story as it could have been.\" \nMecklenburg County revealed Tuesday that it was facing a computer outage after an employee opened an email attachment containing malicious software. Hackers had sought digital currency worth more than $23,000 to unlock the data. \nA forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information.

Lords chief whip to stand down in 2018 amid questions over expenses Lord Bassam has told Labour peers he plans to stand down in early 2018 (Labour Party/PA) 1 comment \nLabour\u2019s chief whip in the House of Lords will stand down in the New Year after questions were raised about his expenses claims. \nLord Bassam had already offered to repay expenses claimed for travelling between London and his home in Brighton, although he said he had not breached parliamentary rules but could have dealt with the issue in a \u201cmore appropriate\u201d way. \nHe has now told Labour peers he plans to stand down in early 2018 once they have elected a replacement, a Labour Lords spokesman said. \nThe Mail on Sunday reported that as chief whip and because his main home is not in London, he is one of a small number of Lords frontbenchers entitled to a Lords office holders\u2019 allowance \u2013 currently \u00a336,366 a year. \nThe payment \u2013 paid as part of his salary \u2013 is to cover peers\u2019 \u201cexpenses in staying overnight away from their main or only residence\u201d. \nHowever the paper said that rather than using it to cover the costs of a second home in London or hotel bills, Lord Bassam simply made the hour-long train journey between Brighton and the capital. \nAt the same time the paper said he also claimed about \u00a36,400 a year in expenses for train tickets and cab fares. \nIn a statement on Sunday, Lord Bassam said: \u201cWith my home outside of London, I have been in receipt of the relevant office holders\u2019 allowance for the opposition chief whip in the Lords. \n\u201cAt the same time, in accordance with rules laid down by the House, I have claimed costs for my regular travel to and from Parliament. \n\u201cWhile I have not been advised that any breach of the rules has taken place, waiving the right to such travel claims would perhaps have been a more appropriate response on my part. \n\u201cI will not be submitting any further claims in this way, and instead use the office holders\u2019 allowance to cover those additional costs. \n\u201cI will also discuss with House officials the steps necessary to repay previous travel claims.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bassam", "sentiment":

Ordered it on nov 5th and have had on my sky that my iPhone X order is unknown ! Got a text today 6/12 saying that it will be here before Xmas ! On the sky site says delivery between 5/6 weeks but had no communication other that my text ??\nDepends on a couple of things:\n1) On what date did you sign your credit agreement?\n2) What size and colour did you order?\nIf you had any SMS communications from Sky then you're doing better than most of the October orders - most of us didn't get the text message(s) that went out. Space Grey 256gb models are apparently at the fulfillment centre now, waiting to be sorted and dispatched by DPD. Silver 256gb models are harder to pin down, I believe. Most of the 64gb models seem to be going out with fairly decent regularity.\nThe next phase of your order will probably be \"Awaiting dispatch\" on the app, or on the website it would be \"Thank you for your order. We'll let you know when it's been dispatched.\" When it gets to that stage, your iPhone should be with DPD, waiting for sorting and shipping. The first batch of 256gb space greys have been misplaced, and orders placed more recently are being fulfilled first - sounds like a logistics screw up at DPDs end more than anything, probably the first pallet has been stored out of sight somewhere and they're working in reverse order. As a November order, this may mean that yours will be fulfilled before some of the October orders (assuming you ordered a 256gb space grey), if the last few days are anything to go by.\nYour best course of action is to speak to the help team and actually log a complaint - don't just ask for info, make sure you get a complaint reference number. I did that earlier this week and had a call back yesterday from the complaints team. I'm supposedly due an update call either today or tomorrow as a result.\nThis info is all based on my reading of this forum and many, many calls to the Sky help team, but I would advise you not to take it as gospel - it's only what I've seen and been told.

Kin Cheung AP Photo Judge postpones sentencing of Hong Kong democracy activist By KELVIN CHAN Associated Press December 07, 2017 01:04 AM UPDATED 2 MINUTES AGO HONG KONG \nA judge put off sentencing Thursday for young Hong Kong's democracy leader Joshua Wong in a contempt case stemming from 2014 protests in the semiautonomous Chinese city. \nThe 21-year-old Wong, who was out on bail while he appeals a separate prison sentence, was among a group of 16 activists set to learn their punishments following their convictions on charges of criminal contempt of court. \nBut a High Court judge adjourned the case to an unspecified date to await further submissions from defense lawyers. \nHong Kong law sets no maximum penalty for contempt, with sentences usually ranging by case law and legal precedents.

SUBSCRIBE NOW \nWong and the others were convicted months earlier for failing to comply with a court order to clear out of a protest camp on a main road during the 79-day \"Umbrella Movement\" protests against Beijing's restrictions on elections for Hong Kong's top leader. Wong and some others had pleaded guilty. \nWong rose to global fame, including a starring role in a Netflix documentary, for leading anti-China protests in the city when he was still a teen. \nIn a separate case, he and two other activists had been given prison sentences ranging from six to eight months for their roles in an unlawful assembly that sparked the 2014 protests. They originally got community service or suspended sentences but those were upgraded after the justice secretary asked for a sentencing review, a move that raised fears the city's independent judiciary was being undermined. \nWong was bailed when he received permission to appeal, which will be heard in January.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex chow", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lester shum", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joshua wong", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wong", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mobile & apps from", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelvin chan associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kin cheung ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:40.043+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ce31b205e785d94f181aa557d7c016cbe700a95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ12d1OcfFtBQX63OFaX7pPXDjcAfKl4c3unLskr3bu2we49AwzENhBOD.SKz65BZ01pBiLQhfgW.4zlmogAfcnjFgHHUlDIPHW5hUBK0ZV.xztuaZShHsTgoKgmThsga_T_x8AGBa9QzOp0jtiUDzlP9UBWy0vp7I-", "site_full": "www.blackhatworld.com", "site": "blackhatworld.com", "site_section": "http://www.blackhatworld.com/forums/-/index.rss", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "non_standard_content", "social"], "section_title": "BlackHatWorld - The Home of Internet Marketing", "title": "Free SEO Cost Calculator - Free SEO Report - Find Out How Many Links You Need for Top 10", "title_full": "Free SEO Cost Calculator - Free SEO Report - Find Out How Many Links You Need for Top 10", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.blackhatworld.com/data/avatars/m/165/165062.jpg?1463725918", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2337, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ce31b205e785d94f181aa557d7c016cbe700a95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ12d1OcfFtBQX63OFaX7pPXDjcAfKl4c3unLskr3bu2we49AwzENhBOD.SKz65BZ01pBiLQhfgW.4zlmogAfcnjFgHHUlDIPHW5hUBK0ZV.xztuaZShHsTgoKgmThsga_T_x8AGBa9QzOp0jtiUDzlP9UBWy0vp7I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "LinkBuildingServices (invalid@example.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "Free SEO Cost Calculator - Free SEO Report - Find Out How Many Links You Need for Top 10", "text": "Find Out How Many Links You Need for Top 10 With the Help of SEO Cost Calculator!\n\u200b What are the advantages of SEO Cost Calculator?\n1) SEO Cost Calculator selects backlinks for your link building campaign within your budget and on your requirements\n2) You know how many backlinks are suggested to reach Google TOP\n3) You know the cost and duration of your SEO campaign and can plan your expenses\n4) You can get help expert help from SEO specialist if you need\n5) The tool is FREE\nI Want to Find Out More About SEO Cost Calculator \u200b", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:40.046+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9868e8de8156204f8e9c79b8f727b17668a9fbb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9d70Q6t7WcvEYceV4Wr5TY6J7n4CAQwULwm.JVnks5v3hj.fsGqdtigz49yZGaqjWTRfg3GGc_2A--", "site_full": "www.livestrong.com", "site": "livestrong.com", "site_section": "http://www.livestrong.com/conversations/thread/142-quit-smoking", "site_categories": ["health", "exercise"], "section_title": "Quit Smoking | LIVESTRONG.COM", "title": "Secret Smoker", "title_full": "Secret Smoker | LIVESTRONG.COM", "published": "2017-12-07T00:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 907, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "db69a7ca442cf456930c870cb38d2ae0cbd0fb79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9d70Q6t7WcvEYceV4Wr5TY6J7n4CAQwULwm.JVnks5v3hj.fsGqdtigz49yZGaqjU2rPZDZwx1LQ--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "kashley2018", "published": "2017-12-07T01:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Thank you everyone and it's nice to meet you all!!!

The Canes looked slow. After that first goal, they looked deflated. And they couldn\u2019t create any kind of offensive zone, partially because of the way they attempted zone entries but also because of a failure to forecheck consistently in the defensive zone. The team\u2019s recent performance in the second period is just inexcusable. So, second periods. Including tonight, #Canes have been outscored 10-2 in the middle frame in their last six games.For the season, the second period is the only one in which the #Canes currently have a negative goal differential (25-18). \u2014 Michael Smith (@MSmithCanes) December 6, 2017 Even though the Canes would put up about the same amount of shots in the third period as the first, none were anywhere near the scoring chances of the earlier shots. Sebastian Aho ringed one off the post with a top corner open, Justin Williams missed glove side from close range and I have a hard time believing Brock McGinn wouldn\u2019t have scored had he not been hooked by Daniel Sedin . Speaking of Williams missing glove side, it\u2019s worth mentioning this area of goaltending that Markstrom improved on greatly with his performance against the Hurricanes. The best of chances Carolina had tended to happen on the glove side, and while I screamed in my head \u201ctest the blocker!\u201d it turns out they actually had a point to try that side. Markstrom has his strengths and weaknesses... let's see if the @NHLCanes can exploit those weaknesses as they look to tie this game. #Redvolution pic.twitter.com/77I1hylJAI \u2014 FOX Sports Carolinas (@CanesOnFSCR) December 6, 2017 So is what the Canes need not a physical bout that leads to an OT game-winner but a 6-1 blowout or something of that magnitude? Do they need to blare Forslund\u2019s call of the Noah Hanifin goal before games? Should they start selling pieces or rearranging drastically? I just don\u2019t know what the Hurricanes are missing.

Fabric hangers eliminate the risk of damages that other hangers may leave on delicate clothing. The article will talk of Retail stores can benefit from using Quality Fabrics shirt hangers and shelters.\n\nHowever, if you are a crafty person and you enjoy making things, perhaps you want to get into choosing fabric for bedding so that you can make your comforters and quilts. You can use these for your own home, and give them as gifts as well. The art of quilting has been somewhat lost, which is a shame. There are some people that still make quilts with eminence textile for bedding, and these are often most treasured by those that receive them as gifts.\n\nThis is for some reasons, the first one being that this can result in a great waste of money rather than making the significant savings you were hoping for. This is because cheaper fabrics are much more likely to be of lower eminence, which can mean they wear don and tear more easily, not to mention their appearance and texture may not be ideal.\n\nThe key to making great items to give as gifts or for your own home is buying the right fabric for bedding. For quilts, some of the best types of fabric you can buy are all cotton or cotton blends. These are strong, durable, and soft enough to lay comfortably on the skin while a person is sleeping, or curled up in a chair with a good book on a chilly afternoon.\n\nAlthough the price of labor is higher, this does not necessarily mean that prices of the final product are going to be significantly more expensive than the bottom of the range products. Many retailers of the designer curtain and upholstery fabric will make sure that their products are sourced nationally or nearby parts of the continent, which means that the cost of production and transport can be lower than with items imported from further away.\n\nSome of the items that you are looking for when looking for the shelters include end panels, doors, gable end fabric shelters that feature straight sides, pony wall fabric shelters, airplane hangers and fabric garages. There are numerous companies that sell the products thus you have to be very careful to choose the one that offers the best products in the market to be on the safe side.\n\nThe reason for this is that it is often necessary to buy more yards of a patterned material to get the look right on any item of furniture. This differs from fabrics that come in solid colors, as it will not be necessary to purchase any 'excess' here to make sure that the right part of the pattern is bought and therefore used in the upholstering.\n\nIt is important to note that most of the shelters usually do not need any foundation an important feature that makes them easy to transport. They are also easy to install. Thus it helps to save time and money that would have been used in the process. You also have the option of getting tensioned structures that offer more durability. These usually have metal frames and a flexible cover that helps to create a tensioned structure.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nGet a summary of the things to keep in mind when choosing a fabric store and view our selection of quality fabrics at http://www.uniquequalityfabrics.net now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "william turner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:24:41.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9868e8de8156204f8e9c79b8f727b17668a9fbb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9d70Q6t7WcvEYceV4Wr5TY6J7n4CAQwULwm.JVnks5v3hj.fsGqdtigz49yZGaqjWTRfg3GGc_2A--", "site_full": "www.livestrong.com", "site": "livestrong.com", "site_section": "http://www.livestrong.com/conversations/thread/142-quit-smoking", "site_categories": ["health", "exercise"], "section_title": "Quit Smoking | LIVESTRONG.COM", "title": "Secret Smoker", "title_full": "Secret Smoker | LIVESTRONG.COM", "published": "2017-12-07T00:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 907, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5979189d754570edcbef61d7f755649c97087b73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9d70Q6t7WcvEYceV4Wr5TY6J7n4CAQwULwm.JVnks5v3hj.fsGqdtigz49yZGaqjWashZsKC1ro1kIwnzE9h45", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "FreeMadz", "published": "2017-12-07T04:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Yes!

The cot where Poppi slept on December 11 and 12, 2012 (Cumbria County Council) \nParamedics carried out a \u201cscoop and run\u201d delivering the apparently lifeless toddler at Furness General Hospital at 6.11am but she never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead shortly after 7am. \nDuring the journey, paramedic Nicola Lynn noticed \u201cbright red blood\u201d on the ambulance sheet coming from Poppi. \nMs Irving said this was a \u201ccritical piece of evidence\u201d \u2013 and suggested it was not evidence of blood being purged from the girl after death. \nShe said: \u201cThe speed of which the blood was seen points to the fact that on the balance of probabilities that something happened to this child, in life, in the home?\u201d \nDr Carey replied: \u201cOr something natural happened. I don\u2019t think the evidence is there to support penetration.\u201d Dr Nat Carey in 2010 (Katie Collins/PA) \nHe suggested Poppi\u2019s gastroenteritis virus may have caused the bleeding. \nMs Irving said: \u201cThis was a death that was extremely rapid. The evidence is, save for a few snuffles, this child was well. \n\u201cIt is indicative of something having happened to this child in life?\u201d \n\u201cWell, it\u2019s supportive,\u201d Dr Carey replied. \nMs Irving continued: \u201cThis is an extremely important point in the family proceedings, the presence and timing of that blood, lends itself to the conclusion, it is suggestive something happened to this child? \n\u201cIt is your sticking point then, and it is your sticking point now?\u201d \nDr Carey replied: \u201cThat\u2019s true, but I would not read too much into it.\u201d \nThe child\u2019s exact cause of death remains \u201cunascertained\u201d and the inquest will try to determine how she died.

December 2017 , 0 comments \nGerman industrial production unexpectedly slipped for the second month in a row in October, official data showed Thursday, but the rare blip is unlikely to throw Europe's humming top economy off course. \nOutput from industrial firms fell 1.4 percent month-on-month, federal statistics office Destatis said, whereas analysts had predicted a rise of 0.8 percent. \nThe drop however was mainly down to public holidays and extended weekends in October, the economy ministry said in a statement, adding that it expected the positive growth momentum to continue in Germany. \n\"All soft and hard indicators actually point to a strong surge in industrial production in November,\" agreed economist Carsten Brzeski of ING Diba bank. \n\"There is no reason to get worried,\" he
