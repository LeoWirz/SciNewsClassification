The alert comes as Palestinian leaders encouraged worldwide demonstrations and called for Palestinians to engage in \"three days of rage.\" \nThe US embassy in Jordan published a security warning telling US citizens that Trump's decision may spark protests which \"have the potential to become violent.\" The statement urged US citizens to avoid large gatherings and to maintain a \"high-level of vigilance\" as tensions rise in the region. \nThe embassy, located in Jordan's capital Amman, also temporarily suspended public services, and instructed US personnel to keep a \"low profile.\" \nAll embassy travel outside of Amman was temporarily suspended, and children of US officials were instructed not to attend school on Thursday. \nIn Turkey, the US embassy in Ankara stated that it was aware of plans by several groups to stage public protests, and urged US citizens to avoid areas of large gatherings, particularly around US outposts in Ankara, Istanbul and Adana. \n\"Even gatherings intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence,\" the statement read. \nThe US embassy in Egypt said that Trump's announcement has \"generated significant media attention,\" and Americans in the country are urged to stay vigilant.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite). Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., meets with reporters after House Republicans held a closed-door strategy session as the deadline looms to pass a spending bill to fund the government by week's end, on Capitol Hill... \nBy ALAN FRAMAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Congress seems set to prevent a weekend government shutdown, but lawmakers and President Donald Trump still have longer-range disputes to settle over spending, immigration and other issues before they can declare budget peace. \nWith many on both sides deciding a headline-grabbing federal closure would be a political blunder - at least for now - the House planned to approve legislation Thursday financing federal agencies through Dec. 22. The Senate seemed ready to follow. Without legislation, many agencies would run out of money after midnight Friday and grind to a close. \nThe two-week spending measure is aimed at giving both parties' bargainers more time to reach longer-term budget decisions. To jumpstart that negotiating, Trump and congressional leaders were meeting Thursday to try reaching agreements. \nThe prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\" \nLast week, an unexpected attack by Trump on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., prompted the two Democrats to skip a bargaining session that was planned then. \nThis time, the White House smoothed the waters by following up with a more peaceable, written statement. It praised Pelosi and Schumer for choosing to \"put their responsibility to the American people above partisanship\" and said Trump was anticipating productive talks between \"leaders who put their differences aside.\" \nLater, the White House issued another statement indicating Trump would sign the two-week spending extension. It also laid out administration budget goals, saying money for the military including missile defense and security along the border with Mexico \"must be prioritized in a long-term funding agreement.\" \nFor Republicans, a shutdown would put a humiliating bookend on a year in which they've controlled the White House and Congress with little to show for it. They want the public to focus instead on the GOP's prized $1.5 trillion tax bill, which party leaders hope to send Trump by Christmas. \nThe two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children. \nEven the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members have been threatening to oppose the temporary spending measure, predicted passage. \n\"No one wants a shutdown, including Freedom Caucus members,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters. \nThe roughly 30-member caucus has been trying to win promises from leaders of spending curbs and quick passage of a full-year defense budget in exchange for backing the short-term bill. Without support from many of them, Republicans would need votes from Democrats to push the temporary spending measure through the House. \nWhile many Democrats seemed likely to oppose the short-term bill, enough were expected to support it in the Senate to allow its passage there. They know they'd still have leverage on subsequent bills needed to keep the government running. \nRepublicans control the Senate 52-48 and will need at least eight Democratic votes for passage. \nDemocrats have been using their leverage to insist on spending boosts for health care, infrastructure and other domestic programs that would match increases Republicans want for defense. \nDemocrats are also seeking an agreement to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. Trump ended safeguards against deportation three months ago but has expressed an openness to restoring them. \n___ \nAP reporters Andrew Taylor and Ken Thomas contributed.

(Image: Reuters) \nShares of IRB Infrastructure Developers which tanked as much as 7% in the early morning trades on Thursday on CBI\u2019s action recovered partially but still trading in the negative territory. The Central Bureau of Investigation filed a charge sheet against IRB Infrastructure Developers over alleged illegal purchases of government land. \u201cThe Central Bureau of Investigation has filed a charge sheet today with the Sessions Court, Pune in the matter if an alleged illegal purchase of government land in village Pimploli and nearby, Taluka Maval, District Pune by Aryan Infrastructure Investments Pvt Ltd (AIIPL), a subsidiary of M/s IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd,\u201d IRB Infrastructure Developers said in an exchange filing. \nFollowing the CBI action, the stock of IRB Infrastructure Developers slipped 7.28% to hit an 11-month low of Rs 194.7, while, later in the day, the stock pared off partial losses but was still trading 3.1% down at Rs 203.5 on BSE. IRB Infrastructure denied all allegations made against its CMD Virendra D Mhaiskar in the matter and said that the company is \u201cfully complied with the law of the land\u201d. Amid the heavy trading volumes, more than 1.65 crore shares of IRB Infrastructure exchanged hands on both BSE and NSE with about 1.55 crore on NSE alone, as at 3 pm. \n\u201c The company and its officials have been fully co-operating with the authorities during the course of the investigation and have provided all information and documents upon request,\u201d IRB Infrastructure said. \u201cWe believe that this event should not have any material impact on the business and operations of the company,\u201d IRB Infrastructure added. The research and brokerage firm HSBC downgraded its rating on the stock to \u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d and also slashed price target to Rs 200 rupees from Rs 331. \nMeanwhile, Sensex and Nifty opened almost unchanged in green but quickly extended the gains on Thursday on the back of value buying after an 8-day negation which led the key benchmark indices to drop by 3%. BSE Sensex jumped 316.07 points to hit the day\u2019s high of 32,913.25 while NSE Nifty edged up 110.65 points to mark the day\u2019s high at 10,154.75.

Former Russian Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev waits for a hearing at a court in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017. Ulyukayev who is on trial for allegedly taking a $2 million bribe is expected to deliver... \nBy NATALIYA VASILYEVAAssociated Press \nMOSCOW (AP) - Wrapping up one of Russia's most high-profile trials of the year, a former economic development minister charged with bribery on Thursday accused an oil executive of setting him up and apologized for \"turning back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nAlexei Ulyukayev, the highest-ranking Russian official to be arrested since 1993, was detained last year at the headquarters of Russia's largest oil producer, the state-owned Rosneft, after a sting operation by Russia's main intelligence agency. Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. \nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. \n\"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. \nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared - what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\" \nUlyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. \nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop. \nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev's actions \"are undermining the authority of the government.\" \nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \"those absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised. I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts. When you're doing all right, you shamelessly turn your back on other people's misfortunes.\" \nUlyukayev asked for \"people's\" forgiveness and pledged to devote rest of his life to \"defending people's interests.\" \nThe court is expected to deliver the verdict next week.

If you ended up here looking for a web-oriented library, you should probably redirect to the more recent [**reahl-tofu**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reahl-tofu/3.2.0) page. ToFu stands for Tomography for Fusion, it is an open-source machine-independent python librarywith non-open source plugins containing all machine-dependent routines.It is distributed under the MIT license and aims at providing the fusion community with a transparent and modular tool for creating / designing diagnostics and using them for synthtic diagnostic (direct problem) and tomography (inverse problem).It was first created at the Max-Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) in Garching, Germany, by Didier Vezinet, and is now maintained / debugged / updated by him and other contributors.A sphinx-generated documentation can be found at [the ToFu documentation page](https://ToFuProject.github.io/tofu/index.html)and the code itself is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ToFuProject/tofu)----ToFu provides the user with a series of python classes for creating, handling and visualizing a diagnostic geometry, meshes and basis functions, geometry matrices, pre-treating experimental data and computing tomographic inversions.Each one of these main tasks is accomplished by a dedicated module in the larger ToFu package.In its current version, only the geometry and data-handling modules are released. The others, while operational, are not user-friendly and documented yet, they will be available in future releases.The geometry module is sufficient for diagnostic designing and for a synthetic diagnostic approach (i.e.: computing the integrated signal from a simulated 2D or 3D emissivity).This geometry module allows in particular:* To handle linear and toroidal vaccum vessels* To define apertures and detectors as planar polygons of arbitrary shapes, or to define a spherical converging lens and a circular detector in its focal plane.* To assign an arbitrary number of apertures to each detector (and the apertures do not have to stand in parallel planes)* To automatically compute the full Volume of Sight (VOS) in 3D of each {detector+aperture(s)} set* To discretise the VOS for a numerical 3D integration of a simulated emissivity in order to compute the associated signalIt is in this geometrical sense that ToFu enables a synthetic diagnostic approach, it does not provide the tools for simulating the emissivity (that should be an input, provided by another code).

(Express Photo) \nRiding on his career-best 243 in the third Test against Sri Lanka, India captain Virat Kohli today jumped three places to grab the second position among batsmen in the ICC Test rankings. Kohli\u2019s double ton was followed by a 50 in the second innings as he finished with 610 runs in the series, which India won 1-0 after the first and third Test ended in draws in Kolkata and New Delhi. Kohli, who slammed back-to-back double-centuries and recorded three-figure scores in three consecutive matches, started the series in sixth position but has leapfrogged David Warner, Cheteshwar Pujara, Kane Williamson and Joe Root after the stupendous run which saw him average 152.50. Though 45 points separate him from Australia captain Steve Smith, Kohli would be eyeing the chance of reaching the zenith in all three formats since he is the current No. 1 in ODIs and T20Is, the ICC said in a statement. \nSmith though has been in a different league and last week reached 941 points, the joint fifth-highest in terms of the highest points tally in batting history in Tests. Smith is now on 938 points while Kohli is on 893 points. \nFormer Australia captain Ricky Ponting is the only batsman to have been at the top in all three formats at the same time \u2013 in December-January 2005-06, while his compatriot Matthew Hayden is the other batsman to have topped all three formats. Though Smith enjoys a substantial lead over Kohli, the competition for second to fifth positions remains intense. Before this Test, only 11 points separated second-ranked Pujara from fifth-ranked Kohli. \nFollowing the latest performances, the gap has increased slightly with 28 points now separating second-ranked Kohli from fifth-ranked Williamson. Among other Indians, opener Murali Vijay (up three places to 25th) and middle-order batsman Rohit Sharma (up six places to 40th) are the other batsmen to move up. Pujara slipped two places to the fourth spot, while Ravindra jadeja slumped to the third position after losing a place in the bolwers ranking. R Ashwin was steady at the fourth spot. In the allrounder list, Jadeja was at the second spot, while Ashwin lost a place to be at the fourth position. \nFor Sri Lanka, captain Dinesh Chandimal has gained eight places to take ninth position after finishing the series with 366 runs, the first time he has moved into the top 10. All-rounder Angelo Mathews has moved up seven places to 23rd position after scoring 111 in the first innings while Dhananjaya de Silva\u2019s match-saving 119 in the second innings has lifted him nine places to 47th position. In the ICC Test Team Rankings, India has lost one point but remains well ahead of South Africa at the top of the rankings, while Sri Lanka remains on its pre-series tally of 94 points in sixth place.

The energy drain motion is slow sufficient so as to not intrude with the normal operation of the ultracapacitor pack 200.\nThe ultracapacitor is linked on a circuit board to each the tag\u2019s chip\u2014through a bonding pad originally designed to mount a battery to the chip for a battery-assisted passive (BAP) tag\u2014and its antenna. The ultracapacitor nonetheless requires a power supply to acquire the power it stores, the company notes. FastCAP makes a speciality of ultracapacitor devices and systems for a variety of markets including vitality exploration, aerospace and defense, automotive, and stationary storage. Ioxus designs and manufactures ultracapacitor cells and modules that present peak power and prolong the lifespan of other power sources resembling batteries.\nThe current invention includes an ultracapacitor high-vitality storage pack with structural help, environmental protection, computerized cooling, electrical interconnection of the ultracapacitors, distant ON/OFF switching, a security pre-charge circuit, a security and automatic equalizing discharge circuit, a programmable logic controller, a digital interface to a management area data community for control and standing reporting, and an elective fireplace sensing and suppression system.\nIn a most popular embodiment, the triple can connections are arranged four rows deep and twelve rows alongside the highest to effectively package one-hundred and forty 4 (one hundred forty four) cylindrically formed ultracapacitor cans with threaded polarized connections at each end of the can. Wireless energy tools employing an ultracapacitor may be charged simply before use.\nThough the ultracapacitor pack 10 and the half modules 15 are proven as being generally rectangular in form, either or both might have shapes aside from usually rectangular resembling, but not by means of limitation, circular, oval, other curvilinear shapes, other rectilinear shapes, and other polygonal shapes.

He spoke with such confidence and authority. He announced that everyone was pure awareness, and that the body was illusory, not real. I felt sorry for his students, poor things. The teacher is a dickhead. \nI do know that at the quantum level the body does not exist in the way we experience it through our senses. I know from direct meditative experience that the body is reducible to empty space. However, I\u2019ve never met anyone who lives in and as empty space. I\u2019ve never met anyone who doesn\u2019t feed, clothe, care for, house, pleasure, punish, purify, electrify, beautify or degrade the body. \nIt is illusory only at a level of manifestation we do not live in on a daily basis. So, dear teacher, if you are going to say and mean that you (not your students or me) are not the body, great; please get off the grid. Head for the hills and disappear into the empty space. \nThe genius who invented bodies and empty space and the awareness within it, and with whom I have had many intimate conversations, confirmed my appraisal of the teacher as a dickhead. The gender-less genius, the creator, told me that the problem we have with the body is that we don\u2019t understand it, that we are afraid of it and, in some ways, dislike it. \nThat\u2019s where body-shaming religious priests of all kinds and stupid spiritual teachers find their niche: they exploit our misunderstanding, fear and dislike of our bodies, especially the sex and sexy parts and the body\u2019s capacity for erotically-charged, mind-blowing orgasms, tidal waves of transcendent sensation so powerful as to redirect the orbits of planets . \nWe are no more the body than we are not the body, says the genius inventor of both body and not-body. Body and not-body, form and formlessness, fullness and emptiness \u2014 these co-exist. They are pairs of lovers who cannot exist on their own. They would perish in isolation. \nIf we get off the concept train, where the body is a thing, and begin to look into it, see it, appreciate its marvels and mysteries and beauty, we\u2019d quickly align with the genius inventor of it all, who, by the way, delights in the bodies and the spaces, the emptiness and the fullness, the pure stillness and the frenzied chaos of earthshaking orgasmic eroticism that electrifies everything within a thousand feet. \nLet\u2019s take a brief look at the body, the actual body, not the conceptual body this teacher is so afraid of and obviously knows nothing about. As you read these snapshots of the body, please take a moment to really visualize and experience each picture; don\u2019t just read it as a bit of information. Rather, feel each part of the body and all its processes. How many of them are you consciously aware of? \nLet yourself be enchanted by the genius of it all, having been created from nothing: stop and count to 2.5 trillion, or 10,000 times or 200 specialized types of cells . Marvel at how amazing the body is! It\u2019s a constantly changing circus, an ecosystem as big as the cosmos. \nFor about 30 minutes, every person on Earth was a single, solitary cell. Then, in just nine months, a fetus transforms from this single cell into a being with trillions of 200 specialized types of cells. \nAn adult is made up of 7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (7 octillion) atoms. For perspective, there\u2019s a measly 300,000,000,000 (300 billion) stars in our galaxy. The atoms that make up your body are mostly empty space, so despite there being so many of them, without that space you would compress into a tiny volume. \nThe nucleus that makes up the vast bulk of the matter in an atom is so much smaller than the whole structure that it is comparable to the size of a fly in a cathedral. If you lost all your empty atomic space, your body would fit into a cube less than 1/500th of a centimeter (0.000787 of an inch) on each side. \nThere are 2.5 trillion (give or take) red blood cells in our body at any moment. To maintain this number, about two and a half million new ones need to be produced every second by our bone marrow. That\u2019s like a new population of the city of Toronto every second. \nNerve impulses travel to and from the brain at speeds of up to 250 miles per hour. \nIn one square inch of our hand, we have nine feet of blood vessels, 600 pain sensors, 9,000 nerve endings, 36 heat sensors and 75 pressure sensors. \nThere are 10,000 times more microbes in our intestines than human beings on the planet. Not only are we way outnumbered, these tiny creatures keep us alive, partly by donating genes and proteins that we rely on. \nOur heart beats around 100,00 times every day or about 30 million times in a year. \nOur bodies have 60,000 miles of blood vessels. \nOur feet have 52 bones. \nOur body contains enough iron to make a spike strong enough to hold our weight. \nOne square inch of human skin contains 625 sweat glands. \nThe heart pumps about one million barrels of blood during an average lifetime; that\u2019s enough to fill two oil super-tankers! \nThe DNA helix measures 80 billionths of an inch wide. \nThere are 137 million light sensitive cells in the eye\u2019s retina and the fluid that fills the eye is changed 15 times a day. \nHumans shed about 600,000 particles of skin every hour, about 1.5 pounds a year. By 70 years of age, an average person will have lost 105 pounds of skin. \nWhen we blink one eye, we move more than 200 muscles. \nIn 24 hours, the blood in the body travels a total of 12,000 miles \u2014 that\u2019s four times the width of North America. \nThe atoms that make up our human body today are the same atoms that formed during the Big Bang, 13.7 billion years ago. Hydrogen, the most common element in the universe and a major feature of your body, was produced in the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. Heavier atoms such as carbon and oxygen were forged in stars between seven and 12 billion years ago, and blasted across space when the stars exploded. \nSurprisingly, not all the useful DNA in your chromosomes comes from your evolutionary ancestors \u2014 some of it was borrowed from elsewhere. Your DNA includes the genes from at least eight retroviruses. These are a kind of virus that makes use of the cell\u2019s mechanisms for coding DNA to take over a cell. At some point in human history, these genes became incorporated into human DNA. \nThese viral genes in DNA now perform important functions in human reproduction, yet they are entirely alien to our genetic ancestry. \nThe picture of the world we see is artificial. Our brains don\u2019t produce an image the way a video camera works. Instead, the brain constructs a model of the world from the information provided by modules that measure light and shade, edges, curvature and so on. This makes it simple for the brain to paint out the blind spot, the area of your retina where the optic nerve joins, which has no sensors. \nIt also compensates for the rapid jerky movements of our eyes called saccades, giving a false picture of steady vision. But the downside of this process is that it makes our eyes easy to fool. TV, films and optical illusions work by misleading the brain about what the eye is seeing. \nIf the human brain were a computer, it could perform 38 thousand-trillion operations per second. The world\u2019s most powerful supercomputer, Blue Gene, can manage only .002% of that. \nThe human brain has around 86 billion neurons, which can make 1,000 trillion synaptic connections. \nA condition called synesthesia can cause senses to overlap. In other words, some people can taste words or hear colors. \nThe endocrine system is the human body\u2019s network of glands that produce more than 100 hormones to maintain and regulate basic bodily functions. Hormones are chemical substances carried in the bloodstream to tissues and organs, stimulating them to perform some action. \nThe glands of the endocrine system include the pituitary, pineal, thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, pancreas, adrenals, and ovaries or testes. The endocrine system oversees many critical life processes. These involve growth, reproduction, immunity (the body\u2019s ability to resist disease), and homeostasis (the body\u2019s ability to maintain a balance of internal functions). \nOkay, that\u2019s enough for this article. But you are welcome to continue an exploration of the actual body on your own. I\u2019ll bet you\u2019ll be so constantly amazed that you won\u2019t ever even wonder if you are or are not the body. You\u2019ll live in amazement, wonder, and awe. You\u2019ll see a thought speed by, carried by legions of silent non-thoughts. \nYou will, I suggest, become both pairs of the lovers that were created by the genius who made it all up \u2014 lovers loving all without prejudice. Imagine having to come up with the body on a design table! The genius who created the body lives in the body as the body. Don\u2019t dis the body, don\u2019t dis the genius inventor of the body, don\u2019t dis the galloping horses in the spacious meadows of atoms. *** \nRobert Rabbin began his professional journey in 1985, after spending 10 years living and working with meditation master Swami Muktananda. Since then, he had developed an international reputation as a radically brilliant speaker and public speaking guru, as well as a distinguished self-awareness facilitator, leadership adviser, and personal mentor. Robert was the creative source and director of Speaking Truthfully , through which he offered masterclasses and private mentoring in authentic self-expression and public speaking. He had published eight books and more than 200 articles on authentic living and public speaking, leadership, self-inquiry, spiritual activism, and meditation. In January 2012, he was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer, and was told he had a few months to live. However, in keeping with his contrarian nature, he continued to thrive past the predicted use-by date. He lived in Los Angeles, until his passing on from this world in the first week of December this year.

I can get a mortgage at 1.09% for my house (\u00a3200,000 left to pay) if I don't withdraw money from it. Then I can buy a flat to let with another mortgage of say 2% after my deposit ( deposit of \u00a320,000 and the flat being worth \u00a3100,000 ). Total monthly fees =\u00a3920+x = around \u00a31400 also.\n2. I can get a mortgage at 1.09% for my house even after withdrawing \u00a3100,000 (so \u00a3300,000 left to pay ) and can buy the flat to let outright. Total mortgage fees monthly = \u00a31400\nAs you can see both have the same monthly fees even though I'm paying more interest in 2.

To be clear, speed in Zwift, when using a dumb trainer, is based on an algorithm, basically, of weight, road grade, and estimated power (or actual power if a power meter is present). There's other stuff, e.g. drafting, but basically that's it. Estimated power is derived from wheel speed given the resistance curve of a given trainer.\nQuote: : The trainer doesn\u0092t change resistance so you have to change to more difficult gear and crank power up and keep cadence high to get it to reflect in game higher speed. Correct, but cadence does not need to be high to make power, although higher cadences make generating more power easier because the pedal torque load is lower, which is less fatiguing on leg muscles. It usually requires more cardiovascular fitness, but it's more repeatable doing lots of reps at light load than at heavier load. So, in Zwift, whether you kick up the watts using torque or rpm, the more power you make, the faster you go.\nQuote: : On smart trainer the trainer becomes more difficult to spin just as riding outside gets more difficult when you hit a hill. Just like outside you select an easier gear to allow easier spin and higher cadence. Yes, and looking at the graphs you posted, you can clearly see you were making more power at the indicated point on the smart trainer. That's why you were going faster. Also, that happened at lower RPM than what you did on the dumb trainer; maybe you felt like you were handling the effort better, but at 68rpm, you were not only spinning slower, you weren't even spinning; that's grinding it out!\nQuote: : That was my experience yesterday. I was able to maintain a higher speed uphill. Im not using erg mode. I can\u0092t explain why it feels different but it does and allowed for better real feel. I agree a controlled trainer feels better in Zwift, but again, you went faster because you made 73% more power.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:19.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6d67af031ca6348a6bfb89f91abb416cc6630a0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9_fGYanr3PdzYePpDVqd0Ry_ZGTg6FYAivHlUVpWXbM09dym0ljw.n_k.ZJHtru7Sks3_1UuQS4g--", "site_full": "www.rebellesociety.com", "site": "rebellesociety.com", "site_section": "http://www.rebellesociety.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Rebelle Society", "title": "I\u2019m Opening a Temple for the Grief Song.", "title_full": "I\u2019m Opening a Temple for the Grief Song.", "published": "2017-12-07T09:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.rebellesociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bigstock-Silhouette-Formal-Ice-With-Flo-56391191-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6d67af031ca6348a6bfb89f91abb416cc6630a0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9_fGYanr3PdzYePpDVqd0Ry_ZGTg6FYAivHlUVpWXbM09dym0ljw.n_k.ZJHtru7Sks3_1UuQS4g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sandy Ibrahim", "published": "2017-12-07T09:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "I\u2019m Opening a Temple for the Grief Song.", "text": "{ source } \nI\u2019m wondering why every conversation we have isn\u2019t about climate change and the mass extinction event we are in. I\u2019m resisting the urge to hate myself and humanity as a result. \nIt is odd though, isn\u2019t it? \nOdd that dollar stores still exist. Odd that we buy bobble-headed celebrities to stuff into stockings, and then toss them in the garbage mid-January. It\u2019s odd that we are all aware of and witnessing climate change while we shop on Amazon for light-up Christmas sweaters and consider the virtue of Roomba. (I sent my son a sweater today \u2014 I hope he likes it.) \nIt is odd, isn\u2019t it? \nIt\u2019s odd that we\u2019re not talking about it. I mean, you and me. You and me at the checkout counter. You and me at the water cooler. You and me on the street. \nWe say Christmas is about giving. But who is really making the sacrifice? We are taking from Earth\u2019s limited resources to give each other crap we don\u2019t need while threatening our very survival. It\u2019s batshit crazy. But even as I type this sentence and take my stand as a grieving consumer, I wonder if my friends and family will be offended or think I\u2019m being a downer. \nI worry my feelings might make someone uncomfortable. \nIf I feel like this, will I still be welcomed at Christmas dinner? (And can I still have a Roomba?) \nI don\u2019t believe I am a downer, but I am down. I am grief-struck that our society cares more about small talk and empty consumerism than we do about providing a living planet for the next generation. I\u2019ve heard it said that indigenous cultures in North America thought seven generations ahead, and here I am, at 50, wondering what the world will look like for my kids should they reach this age. Seriously. Speaking of downers, imagine that instead of showing up for turkey dinner already prepared, you first had to go into the heart of the factory farm and pick out your bird. With your full presence, you would have to see the cages, the torture, and the disease behind your Christmas meal. How would that feel? Would you still eat it? We as a culture have disconnected ourselves from bad feelings, and have socialized each other into a state of denial, numbness and hidden despair. This is the consciousness that arises from the patriarchal and the survivalist game we are playing. This is the source of our cognitive dissonance and the collective trance we are disengaged in. We\u2019ve been tamping down our feelings for centuries, and it is killing us. We aren\u2019t evil, but the energy we use in keeping up the appearance that we are all fine is dangerous and destructive. It allows cruelty and profound over-consumption to be normalized. This desensitization and mental distortion dams up our creativity, and leaves it to fester in the toxic build-up of a culture that rejects tough emotions by saying they\u2019re weak. The culture is wrong. So, while the Earth burns, we post happy selfies, because happiness is a sign of success. And success is everything . \nBut if we feel nothing, we feel nothing for each other. \nThe planet is just a piece of dirt. Women are just bodies. \nLife is unsustainable if it\u2019s not inhabited by our feelings . \nForget tickets to Disneyland, emotional restoration is what our children really need this season. *** \nWhere does grief go when it doesn\u2019t belong? When you wake up to the news that 60, or 600 or 6000 are dead, where does the sorrow hibernate? I\u2019ve read \u2014 maybe you have too \u2014 that we could all be dead by 2050. We could all be dead by 2050. My children. Your children. Our children\u2019s children. Even the puppy across the road. \nWhere does the grief go? Without grief, where is the hope? Without grief, where is the growth? No new growth. \nI\u2019m opening a temple for the grief song. For the long wail The howl of the broken-hearted The shaking, cold, long drop deep into death. \nWe mourners will light a fire and gather around chairs until tears turn to laughter and laughter to hope", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "disneyland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:19.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1937ab934230db8365dddeca8e0bc848ee5165fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSrY3zTBFQr2qgROFi_9LlEtSh.a4kqws1cZ7G9vLEkKdM7jkrZS.DCTbF0rqavPJG494S7Ze4epz0aepG2iDChLR_C_CNi4k-", "site_full": "itunes.apple.com", "site": "apple.com", "site_section": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios-finance/id6015?mt=8", "site_categories": ["tech", "television", "shopping", "mac_support", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Finance - App Store Downloads on iTunes", "title": "Navy Federal Credit Union", "title_full": "Navy Federal Credit Union on the App Store", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/f6/d6/31/f6d63140-134d-51a9-3bc3-5ebf9b07b010/source/1200x630bb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 49, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e404dfd0fdbe3d35bf824cb066a273857167f469", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSrY3zTBFQr2qgROFi_9LlEtSh.a4kqws1cZ7G9vLEkKdM7jkrZS.DCTbF0rqavPJG494S7Ze4epz0aepG2iDCWJ_dWXsXgfvpVaHkx_iYKhmYC.AOIE.Luu5nEcEvl7w0d3nHwkd7kw--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "ChrisR83", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Still no iPhone X support?

But a boundary, in its most sacred form, is simply delineating between what happens within a certain space and what does not. In this sense, creating boundaries is a drawing in rather than a pushing away. \nSetting boundaries is as much about what you are saying Yes to as it is about what you are saying No to. It is actually generous to reveal your boundaries, and a deep act of vulnerability to ask for what you need. \nPersonally, I love boundaries! \nPartly because I love them, and partly because I work with so many people who struggle with them, I wanted to clear up this misunderstanding of what boundaries are. \nOften, people who have an aversion to boundary-setting or receiving view it as an act of separation, in opposition to love. But the act of setting or holding a boundary is not correlated to having an open heart, or a closed heart, or anything about how much one person loves another. \nIn fact, I believe setting boundaries is actually an act of great love! \nI have set boundaries and have had boundaries set with me with a wide open heart, where the space between us is deeply receptive while there is a boundary being set. And I\u2019ve also had the experience of somebody not setting a boundary and being disconnected and closed in relationship to me. \nOf course, our boundaries (like all communication) will be received better if set with an open heart, especially if they are with people whom we love and want connection and intimacy with, but whether we have an open or closed heart is irrelevant to whether we are setting a boundary or not. So let\u2019s set that piece aside for now, and just talk about the connection between boundaries and love. \nWhen I work with my clients, I often hear things like: \n\u201cBut we love each other, so I guess I need to learn to be okay with (insert behavior they are totally not okay with)\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not getting what I want, so I\u2019m out of here.\u201d \nBut neither of those are what I could call setting a loving boundary. \nBegin by Slowing Down \nMany of us have never taken enough time to truly know and feel what we do and don\u2019t want \u2014 in our lives and in our relationships. To become more intimate with our own needs and desires requires slowing things down. \nI remember when my son was young, he used to say No to everything first. You could say, \u201cHey Trent, would you like some ice cream?\u201d And he\u2019d say, \u201cNo!\u2026 I mean, yes.\u201d \nBy saying No first, he was slowing things down. Some part of him needed to set his boundary first, and then he could take the step forward and say Yes . He was discovering more of who he was in the process. \nIf you are new to saying No , or setting boundaries, sometimes a good first step is to assume No first. By saying No , or Not right now , or I need to think about that and get back to you , you slow the interaction down enough to be able to tell whether you are truly a Yes or a No . \nIt\u2019s an enormous act of self-love to set a boundary. Not only can I love who I know myself to be by setting the boundary, but I also discover more of who I am as I go. \nSetting boundaries is an act of love for the other. \nI believe it\u2019s not just an act of self-love to set a boundary, but an act of love for the other as well. There are a few reasons why I believe this. \nFirst, it honors the other person as a whole being. \nIf I am willing to set a boundary with you, I believe you can receive it, and I trust you enough to speak it in the first place. If I don\u2019t want to be close to somebody, I will just distance myself. Setting a boundary requires that I step in closer. If I am setting a boundary with someone, it means I\u2019m engaging in the relationship. \nIt is also an act of love and generosity to not withhold parts of ourselves from them. \nBoth the things we are not okay with, and those things we desire in the relationship. \nSecondly, when my children are acting out (and this happens with adults all the time too!), they sometimes get spun out and lose their minds a little bit. They\u2019ll say things they don\u2019t mean, or kick and scream. \nSomething I say to my kids when this happens is, \u201cI love you too much to let you act like that,\u201d because I know they don\u2019t want to hurt me, or each other, and they don\u2019t want to break anything. But, in that moment, they are having strong feelings that overcome their ability to make good decisions about how to behave. \nSetting a boundary with them in that moment is an act of love. It\u2019s setting a container. It says, This is what happens inside this space, and this is what doesn\u2019t happen inside this space . \nSelf-Centered vs Healthy Boundary-Setting \nThere are self-centered ways to set boundaries, which is more along the lines of: \nI\u2019m not getting what I want, so I\u2019m out of here or I deserve better than this . \nThen there are healthy ways. An example of this is: In order to____, I would need____ . As in, In order to continue talking about this with you right now, I would need you to stop stomping around the house . \nI love this format, because it takes radical self-responsibility while also asking for what you need. It\u2019s saying Even if I\u2019m the only person in the world who needs this, that is what I need . It does not say You are a bad person, and if you really loved me, you would already know this! \nIt is a radical act of love for the other person because it does not assume the other person is behaving in this way on purpose to aggravate you. \nSo many of us assume if the other person isn\u2019t doing the thing we want or need, then they must not want to, aren\u2019t willing to, or won\u2019t \u2014 but often we\u2019ve just never asked. \nIt\u2019s important in a relationship to give the other person all the information they need to make their own choices. \nIt\u2019s vulnerable because it acknowledges that we actually do have needs. \nMost humans have a desire to be self-reliant. We tend to be afraid of needing anything from other people. And there is also a more New Age belief that we should be able to be okay with any behavior from other people and simply rise above it or not take it personally . But, frankly, I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true. We do need other people, and we do have limits. \nThis format also takes out the judgment of whether that other person wants it, or anybody else wants it, and its honors that I want this \u2014 that it is true for me. \nI believe creating boundaries is sacred work. *** \nFounder of Fierce Grace: Practices of Embodied Wholeness for Women , Kendra Cunov has been studying, teaching, facilitating and practicing Authentic Relating, Embodiment Practices and Deep Intimacy Work for the last 15 years.

Subscribe 24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter! Back to Article news The UK Electoral Commission announced that it is examining Momentum. The watchdog is investigating whether the pro-Corbyn group breached spending limits during the 2017 General Election campaign. Momentum spokesperson admits \"administrative errors\" were made. Momentum was set up in 2015 to support Corbyn as Labour leader. \nLONDON \u2014 Momentum, the group set up to support Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party, is being investigated by the UK's Electoral Commission over its expenditure during the general election campaign. \nThe Commission announced on Thursday that it is examining whether the left-wing national campaign group breached election spending rules in the run-up to the June 8 general election. \nSpecifically, the watchdog will investigate whether Momentum overspent during the election campaign, and whether it the accounts for its payments and donations were either inaccurate or incomplete. \nA press release on the investigation published Thursday morning said the investigation will cover: \nwhether or not Momentum spent in excess of the spending limits for an unauthorised non-party campaigner in the UK Parliamentary general election. \nwhether or not Momentum submitted a return that did not include accurate donation information and/or the required declaration stating that the donation return was complete and accurate. \nwhether or not Momentum submitted a return that was not a complete statement of payments made in respect of controlled expenditure. \nwhether or not Momentum submitted a return that did not include all invoices for payments of more than \u00a3200. \nMomentum has admitted \"administrative errors\" were made over its election spending that can be \"easily rectified.\" \nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the group said: \"Momentum put a lot of effort and resources into detailed budgeting and financial procedures during the election to ensure full compliance. \"Our election campaign was delivered on a low budget because it tapped into the energy and enthusiasm of tens of thousands of volunteers across the country. \"Much of the Electoral Commission investigation refers to administrative errors that can be easily rectified. We have a good working relationship with the Electoral Commission, and will fully comply with the investigation going forward.\" \nMomentum was founded in 2015 following Corbyn's shock victory in the leadership contest following the resignation of former Labour leader Ed Miliband. \nThe group says it has more than 30,000 paying members, divided into nearly 200 branches across the country. It says 1,500 more have joined since the Labour Party's annual conference in September. \nMomentum played a major role in supporting Labour in the June 8 general election, especially online, where its social media posts reached millions of people. \nBob Posner, the Electoral Commission\u2019s Director of Political Finance and Regulation and Legal Counsel, said: \"Momentum are a high profile active campaigning body. Questions over their compliance with the campaign finance rules at June\u2019s general election risks causing harm to voters\u2019 confidence in elections. \n\"There is significant public interest in us investigating Momentum to establish the facts in this matter and whether there have been any offences. \n\"Once complete, the Commission will decide whether any breaches have occurred and, if so, what further action may be appropriate, in line with its enforcement policy.\" \nBusiness Insider has contacted Momentum and Corbyn's office for comment. |", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "business insider inc", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:19.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d455662a535a79fc5099d467d8efee2b993eb76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9_fGYanr3PdzYePpDVqd0Ry_ZGTg6FYAivHlUVpWXbM8x2hiivMM1.ZGnRQsUOnsZwSeRdSLg9RA--", "site_full": "www.rebellesociety.com", "site": "rebellesociety.com", "site_section": "http://www.rebellesociety.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Rebelle Society", "title": "Supermoon in Gemini: Accept What Is, and the Truth Will Be Revealed.", "title_full": "Supermoon in Gemini: Accept What Is, and the Truth Will Be Revealed.", "published": "2017-12-07T09:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.rebellesociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bigstock-Beautiful-moon-girl-121399052-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d455662a535a79fc5099d467d8efee2b993eb76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9_fGYanr3PdzYePpDVqd0Ry_ZGTg6FYAivHlUVpWXbM8x2hiivMM1.ZGnRQsUOnsZwSeRdSLg9RA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Becky Hernandez", "published": "2017-12-07T09:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Supermoon in Gemini: Accept What Is, and the Truth Will Be Revealed.", "text": "{ source } \nThe energy for the next few weeks will be very powerful.

Releasing any final outdated ideas, people, places or things that no longer fit with the foundation of your life. Seeing the truths of who you are, and where you\u2019ve been, can be very freeing. Allow these truths and use them as catalysts for your new life. \n2017 has been a great year of healing and rebirth. Major transformations of spirit and the physical world. It has been a year of cleared illusions, fearful thinking, and outdated wounds. A year of trauma and release. \nNow with this Supermoon in Gemini and many transits this month, including a Mercury retrograde, it is time to see where acceptance can heal, where your foundation has cracks, and to see the full truth of yourself and your life. It\u2019s time for real change! \nThese three cards are asking you to accept what is and build from there. {Photo credit: Becky Hernandez} \n\n\u201cThe Fates: Fate, karma, acceptance\u201d \nThere are things in life you will never be able to control. The conditions brought on by the evolution of the collective, by nature, and by your past experiences. Some experiences may be fated, preordained by Spirit for a greater purpose, and you may not ever be able to understand why. \nYou may not have control over these fated experiences, but you do have a choice of acceptance. You might not be able to change the people, places and things in your life, so accept what is. Now is the time to accept what you cannot change, even if it means honoring yourself by moving on. \n\n\u201cBuilding Blocks: Strong foundation, beautiful work in progress\u201d \nYou have everything you need to cultivate an extraordinary life. This is a time when your focus needs to be on the foundations you are building. Now is the time to build on the strong foundation you have already laid for your prosperity. Now is the time to address any cracks in the foundations of your life. \nPerhaps your values and beliefs have changed, and it\u2019s time to strengthen your convictions and let go of the things that no longer serve the vision you have for your life. {Photo credit: Becky Hernandez} \n\n\u201cTruth Be Told: Honesty, accepting things at face value, coming out of denial\u201d \nThis is a time when you are called to proclaim your truth out loud, and be willing to be transparent, honest, and open in your communication with others and with yourself. Nothing less than surrendering to what is, peeling off the layers of denial that kept you tied to an illusion, will set you free. \nAcceptance of what is constitutes the first step in any movement. Then reflect with honesty on your foundation, your life, and this past year. \nWhere have you been dishonest with yourself or others? Where have you held a grip so tight on your wants that there was no room for spiritual interjection? Did you allow the existential to bring you down so far you couldn\u2019t breathe? These are some of the many questions coming up with these energies and times. This type of reflection helps you move past the trauma in order to allow space for the new. \nDon\u2019t shy away from honest reflection, instead let it guide you to a new and better way of life. Use this Gemini energy to catapult you into a new state of being. A new state of freedom. *** Becky Hernandez (The Misfit Yogi) is an intuitive healer, freedom writer, guided meditator, yogi and life experience seeker.

All searches are complete and the contracts are currently being drafted.\nOur solicitors contacted us yesterday to inform us that the sellers are buying a new build and have been asked by the developers solicitor to hold the deposit as an agent as opposed to a stakeholder when they exchange contracts. This means the developer will get access to their deposit before the completion date.\nThe sellers solicitor have asked to hold our deposit as agent on exchange too which effectively means our deposit will be passed through to the developer of their new build before completion. This therefore poses a risk to us if the developer goes bust or if the sellers pull out of their contract losing our deposit. I gather that the NHBC scheme covers buyers if a builder goes bankrupt but we would still be reliant on recovering the money from the sellers.\nIs this type of thing common? Is it a reasonable request and should we agree to it? Should we ensure anything specific gets added to our contract?\nIt doesn\u0092t sit well with us at all considering our deposit would be 60K which is a lot to lose if things go pear shaped.

The analysts of the report highlight that crude oil prices have fallen from three figure mark in 2012 to just over 50 in the recent years, which is primarily a reflection of doubled domestic production in the U.S. in past couple of years and this decreased fuel prices is promoting various industries to reserve for the future. \nIn addition to that, there as numerous exploration activities currently underway across the world, and technology has improved radically to detect every fruitful oil resource and extract it efficiently. This scenario once again makes for the need for proper storage facilities. Increasing demand for other petroleum products such as lubricants and gasoline, changing consumer preference for alternative fuels that are ecofriendly and emergence of liquefied natural gas (LNG) that can power marine containers are some of the other factors aiding to the prosperity of the global oil storage market. On the other hand, strict government regulations regarding the usage of fossil fuels, restrictions pertaining to exploration and production activities, and gradual shift of the automotive industry towards the electric options are a few factors obstructing the prosperity of the global oil storage market. Nevertheless, the vendors of the global oil storage market are expected to gain new opportunities from solidified natural gas technology for natural gas storage, growing usage of satellite imagery to quantify storage tanks, and emergence of alternate fuels for greener shipping. \nBased on the type of storage, the global oil storage market can be segmented into fixed roof tanks, open top tanks, floating roof tanks, and other storage facilities, whereas product-wise, the market can be bifurcated into crude oil, aviation fuel, gasoline, and middle distillates. On the basis of reserve type, the market for oil storage can be categorized into strategic petroleum reserve and commercial petroleum reserve. Currently, the segment of strategic petroleum reserves constitutes for the maximum share of demand, owing to steadily increasing investment for these reserves from governments across various countries. On the other hand, the segment of commercial petroleum reserves is also projected to have a fruitful future for its vendors as the capacity expansion helps in planning of future oil usage. \nGeographically, the region of the Middle East and Africa continues to be most prominent and is expected to retain its dominant position, with strong traction coming from countries such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Oman, and Nigeria, wherein oil production is surging and hence the prices of oil is decreasing. At the second position is North America, driven by the developed countries of the U.S. and Canada. In the U.S., the production of oil has seen tremendous growth in the past decade owing to high investments for exploration and extraction activities. Asia Pacific is another lucrative region, driven by countries such as China, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. \nAs far as the competitive landscape is concerned, the global oil storage market is pretty much consolidated among a handful of players such as Buckeye Partners L.P., NuStar Energy L.P., Oiltanking GmbH, Royal Vopak N.V., and Kinder Morgan Inc. The threat of new players is moderate to low in this market as the market leaders will continue to strengthen their position via collaborations and joint ventures. \nGet Sample Copy of this Report", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "oiltanking gmbh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal vopak n.v.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kinder morgan inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cagr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buckeye partners l.p.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nustar energy l.p.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:45:21.059+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ea652ea35ee6aa802f65f8615cc0397d47096405", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9VxZvlVsEBMRfpw--", "site_full": "forums.moneysavingexpert.com", "site": "moneysavingexpert.com", "site_section": "http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/forumdisplay.php?f=16", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "House Buying, Renting &amp; Selling - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "title": "Completion day", "title_full": "Completion day - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T11:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.209, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2270, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ea652ea35ee6aa802f65f8615cc0397d47096405", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwpfpRw.8wzF9ehGIH9IrJvqxgmIeBD_U3UOVUzPYLjtOJn.y0uGHnTAhPmCEK9VxZvlVsEBMRfpw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "whatdoyouthink...", "published": "2017-12-07T11:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Completion day", "text": "Hi Everyone,\nTomorrow is completion day and I\u0092ll be moving into a new build house .
