The filing period for state and local offices begins Wednesday, Jan 10 and runs through Friday, Feb. 9. So there\u2019s a limited window of time. \n\u201cYou would want someone who gave it careful consideration,\u201d Beumer said. \u201cIt does take time away from family. It\u2019s a commitment.\u201d \nWhile labeled a \u201cpart-time\u201d legislature, holding a seat in the House of Representatives requires more time than meets the outsider\u2019s eye, according to Beumer, who said he routinely handles phone calls and emails connected to the Statehouse year round, not just when the Indiana General Assembly is in session during the winter and early spring months. \n\u201cDuring session, my typical schedule was to leave for Indianapolis every Sunday and not come home Thursday night,\u201d Beumer said. \u201cCheck with your family. It will impact your family life \u2014 and not just while you\u2019re in session. Every single day I\u2019ve had at least an email and a phone call. But serving as as state representative has been a rewarding experience, Beumer said, for reasons the general public might not expect. \n\u201cA lot of people think it\u2019s about authoring and passing legislation,\u201d Beumer said. \u201cFirst and foremost it\u2019s about providing constituent services and being able to help people in distress over problems with governmental agencies.\u201d \nDuring his time in office \u2014 which began in October of 2013 when incumbent Bill Davis resigned \u2014 Beumer said he was able to help a single mom with child in need of surgery cut through red tape to access some of her state retirement funds. It was just one of many examples Beumer has, quietly, behind-the-scenes made a difference in his Statehouse role. \n\u201cMy biggest single disappointment is not being able to get legislation passed waiving the requirement that city court judges have to be attorneys.\u201d - State Rep. Greg Beumer \n\u201cState Senators and State Representatives have a lot of influence and can help people solve some of these issues if they use a common-sense approach,\u201d Beumer said. \nBeumer is a well-known public servant in Randolph County. He first attempted to win a Statehouse seat in 1992 when State Rep. David Hoover decided not to run but narrowly lost to Ron Liggett. \nThat loss, though, by about 200 votes, turned out to be Randolph County\u2019s gain, as Beumer went on to serve as a County Commissioner from 1993 to 2000 and later as a member of the Union School Board. \nGetting legislation authored and passed is difficult in the best of circumstances and nearly impossible in the worst ones. Beumer said his biggest regret was not being able to change the way city court judges are chosen in Indiana. \n\u201cMy biggest single disappointment is not being able to get legislation passed waiving the requirement that city court judges have to be attorneys,\u201d Beumer said. \nBeumer explained City Court Judges only deal with issues they can\u2019t send offenders to jail for like traffic citations or city ordinance violations, so no law degree would be required. \nBecause a law degree is required, some cities are struggling, according to Beumer. He said the Dunkirk City Court had to close because there was no one available with a law degree to take the job. \nBeumer said he didn\u2019t plan to file another bill in an attempt to change the law, since this will be a \u201cshort\u201d session. Deadline to file legislation is Dec. 8. \nBeumer\u2019s district covers all of Randolph and Jay counties in addition to the eastern third of Delaware County. \nBeumer said anyone interested in running for his House of Representatives seat and who has questions may call him at 765-238-0365.

I don't expect to use this that often and the 12,000 RPM single speed is satisfactory without being able to change speeds. stars: 4", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:42.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c04077b66e0888e26f3339c5c4e15680ac2d3c19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg..c1MHXHmlm7PR_20hkirVbzJPF98qrBtn2t8lT4HXJUZuaG2BoG_t7sgTAFJLACa96GeLNZacWp0eQNqe8G1NGjpDbIect_ojNxgWFTcJ5EMl8MdknsCFxSpkjLd0FzFnHHS_JfjwYrmO9aeIletskFnm_LsW3MplJvsxVlFAQJHG8IPbQcqQc1ACQXUsWHWFQcpI.fvHGOCPr368S4EE", "site_full": "www.nwitimes.com", "site": "nwitimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.newsbug.info/search/?q=&t=article&l=100&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&nsa=eedition&c[]=news/national/indiana,news/national/indiana/*&f=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "www.newsbug.info - RSS Results in news/national/indiana,news/national/indiana/* of type article", "title": "State OKs health insurance plan for Gary schools that saves money, reduces debt", "title_full": "State OKs health insurance plan for Gary schools that saves money, reduces debt", "published": "2017-12-05T16:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/newsbug.info/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/03/a03f5bde-b0b4-5fe8-a660-18b1960d31f3/5a25d0f68e882.image.jpg?resize=840%2C630", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 37475, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c04077b66e0888e26f3339c5c4e15680ac2d3c19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg..c1MHXHmlm7PR_20hkirVbzJPF98qrBtn2t8lT4HXJUZuaG2BoG_t7sgTAFJLACa96GeLNZacWp0eQNqe8G1NGjpDbIect_ojNxgWFTcJ5EMl8MdknsCFxSpkjLd0FzFnHHS_JfjwYrmO9aeIletskFnm_LsW3MplJvsxVlFAQJHG8IPbQcqQc1ACQXUsWHWFQcpI.fvHGOCPr368S4EE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dan Carden dan.carden@nwi.com, 317-637-9078", "published": "2017-12-05T16:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "State OKs health insurance plan for Gary schools that saves money, reduces debt", "text": "State OKs health insurance plan for Gary schools that saves money, reduces debt Dan Carden dan.carden@nwi.com, 317-637-9078 \nMicah Vincent, chairman of the Indiana Distressed Unit Appeals Board, reviews documents relating to health insurance for Gary Community School Corp. employees as DUAB Executive Director Courtney Schaafsma looks on Monday at the Indiana Government Center in Indianapolis. Dan Carden, The Times Save \nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The emergency management firm operating the Gary Community School Corp. won state approval Monday for a health insurance contract that minimizes premium increases and potentially eliminates $2.3 million in debt. \nThe Indiana Distressed Unit Appeals Board voted 4-0 to authorize Gary Schools Recovery, Inc., to maintain Cigna as the health insurance provider for the cash-strapped district's 380 employees. \nThey'll see a 5.9 percent premium increase in January compared to 2017 rates. Though that's lower than the 8.94 percent rate hike Cigna initially proposed. \nPerhaps more importantly, Cigna agreed to waive $1.3 million owed by the district because recent school employee health care costs significantly exceeded the premiums paid. \nThe health insurance company also pledged to reduce by $1 million the district's $2.8 million in overdue premium payments if the district signed a two-year contract, continues paying $150,000 a month toward the debt and does not miss any payments over the next year. \n\"We must be timely with our payments, including the $150,000 payback on what would now be $1.8 million,\" said Peggy Hinckley, the district's emergency manager. \"If we miss the $150,000 in any month then the $1 million comes back as a judgment.\" \nIn addition, Cigna promised not to increase 2019 rates by more than 10 percent compared to 2018. \nDUAB Chairman Micah Vincent noted that Cigna's total two-year cost of $12,009,060 exceeded Anthem's bid by $1,142,795. \nBut with Cigna's concessions on rates and past due amounts \u2014 which still would be owed if the district switched providers \u2014 he said Cigna will end up being $1,157,205 less expensive for the district, which regularly relies on state loans to fund operations. \n\"When you go through that calculation, Cigna becomes the better option for Gary Community Schools,\" said Eric Parish, executive vice president of MGT Consulting Group, parent company of the Gary emergency management firm. \nNew DUAB members \nAlso on Monday, Gov. Eric Holcomb named former state Rep. Rebecca Kubacki, R-Syracuse, as his representative on the Distressed Unit Appeals Board that's overseeing the state takeover of the Gary Community School Corp. \nKubacki served two terms in the Indiana House between 2010 and 2014. She was defeated by state Rep. Curt Nisly, R-Goshen, in the 2014 Republican primary, in part because Kubacki voted against a proposed state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. \nThis year's Senate Enrolled Act 567 gave the governor a direct appointment to DUAB, replacing a member formerly selected by Indiana House and Senate leadership. \nIn addition to Kubacki, the other voting members are: Micah Vincent, DUAB chairman, Indiana Office of Management and Budget; Wesley Bennett, Department of Local Government Finance; Paul Joyce, State Board of Accounts; and Kent Hatcher, Department of Education. \nLegislative leaders now pick advisory members for the board. Last month, state Sen. Eric Bassler, R-Washington, replaced state Sen. Ryan Mishler, R-Bremen, after Mishler was named chairman of the budget-writing Senate Appropriations Committee. \nThe other legislative advisers are state Rep. Milo Smith, R-Columbus; and state Sen. Eddie Melton, D-Merrillville. \nFormer DLGF Commissioner Courtney Schaafsma is DUAB's executive director.

The simulation included early infant diagnosis testing for infants aged 6 weeks who were exposed to HIV . Children who received confirmatory testing, and those who did not, were included. Regarding nucleic acid amplification tests, Dunning and colleagues assumed each test would cost $25 (U.S.), with a specificity of 99.6%. For infants who were infected with HIV in utero or at least 4 weeks before testing was completed, the researchers assumed the test had a sensitivity of 100% and a mother-to-child transmission rate of 4.9% for those aged 12 months. The researchers then simulated the rates of testing uptake, result return and ART initiation according to previously established guidelines. All infants were connected with care and treated over 10 years if they had false-positive results and for life if they had true positive results. Of those included in the simulation with HIV, life expectancy remained the same whether or not confirmatory testing was completed (26.2 years). Those who were exposed to HIV had a life expectancy of 61.4 years. When confirmatory testing was not conducted, 128/1,000 infants who had false-positive results began ART . This number was significantly lower when confirmatory testing was completed (1/1,000). The use of confirmatory testing was observed as cost-saving. The cost for a single infant with confirmatory testing equated to $1,790, whereas the cost without additional testing was equal to $1,830 per infant. The cost-efficacy did not change unless the infant underwent a nucleic acid amplification test that cost more than $400 or if a false-positive status was diagnosed, identified and ART was stopped within 3 months. \u201cFalse-positive results occur for a variety of reasons but are likely the result of stretched human resources compromising test specificity and sensitivity via specimen handling errors such as mislabeling of specimens, incorrect specimen placement in the device or inadequate quality control resulting in contamination between specimens during PCR amplification,\u201d Dunning and colleagues wrote. \u201cWHO recommends the use of a second specimen for a confirmatory test, ensuring the independence of the two assays and reducing the likelihood of a false-positive result.\u201d \u201cUnconfirmed [early infant diagnosis] test results therefore cause diagnostic dilemmas for the provider, whilst families may experience confusion and uncertainty about the health system, discouraging future engagement in care,\u201d Dunning and colleagues continued. \u2013 by Katherine Bortz Disclosures: The authors report no relevant financial disclosures.

I recently headed along to Zen Lifestyle for a wee pre-Christmas treat, and it was just the thing to get me feeling relaxed and ~zen~ ahead of the busy month of December. Custom Facials at Zen Lifestyle \nZen Lifestyle kindly invited me along to try one of their custom facials. I\u2019m pretty happy with my skincare routine at home so don\u2019t often get a facial, but it\u2019s nice to do it once in a while for a proper deep clean \u2013 and the chance to lie down and relax for an hour or so! \nEach facial starts off with a skincare consultation. My therapist asked me about the products I was currently using at home, what type of skin I had, and what my main skin concerns were. After taking a look at my skin, she then decided which products would be best suited to my skin type and condition. By getting this skin consultation at the start, it ensures each facial is personalised for each client so you get the full benefits. \nZen Lifestyle use a lot of Murad products in the salon, so my therapist picked out the ones that would suit me best. As I have quite a bit of redness in my skin, we used a few from the Sensitive range \u2013 including the Soothing Gel Cleanser , the Sensitive Skin Soothing Serum and the Correcting Moisturiser . I also got a glycolic peel as part of the treatment, which left my skin feeling smooth, soft and radiant. \nThe facial also included a head, shoulder and arm massage which was very relaxing. The treatment rooms at Zen Lifestyle are super cosy (you even get to snuggle up underneath a faux fur blanket!) so it was really easy to switch off and have a completely chilled out hour of pampering. Omnilux LED Facial Treatment \nAfter the main part of my facial was finished, I got to try out the Omnilux treatment. You can have this on its own, or combined with any of Zen\u2019s other custom facials. The Omnilux is an LED machine which uses light to stimulate skin cells, counteract the effects of ageing and enhance the effect of skincare products. \nIt was a bit weird at first \u2013 the light is SO bright, it feels a little bit like you\u2019re being catapulted towards the sun \u2013 but you soon get used it. Omnilux promises to lift and hydrate your skin, improving your skin\u2019s tone and texture, and smoothing out fine lines. It\u2019s hard to tell whether the Omnilux or just the normal facial were responsible, but my skin certainly did look and feel great after the treatment. If you want to give your skin an extra little boost, I think the Omnilux LED treatment is definitely worth trying out. Worth a Visit? \nI have visited Zen Lifestyle quite a few times over the years for various treatments, including HD Brows, shellac manicures, massages and facials. They\u2019re always a reliable option when you fancy a bit of pampering, and their central locations (on Hanover Street and Bruntsfield Place) make them easy to get to. \nThe treatments are a little bit on the pricier side, with custom facials starting from \u00a359 for 40 minutes or \u00a379 for 60 minutes. But I think it\u2019s totally worth it if you\u2019re after a properly luxurious treatment or you have some skin concerns you want to work on. A relaxing facial or massage would also make a great Christmas present that\u2019s thoughtful and a little bit special. Zen Lifestyle offer a range of vouchers for specific treatments, spa packages or monetary vouchers which can be redeemed against any treatment.

My mother, father, brother all come under this category.  These people are so consumed with there own comforts and eccentricities, that they do not know the damage they inflict, both on themselves and others. \n\nNo amount of logical or good sense, make any impact on them.  I have struggled with these people for everything.  Having to take up a job at a very early age, due to family constraints, I had to leave very early in the morning as I worked in a hospital.  All through my stay with my parents, when I left in the morning to work, the whole house-hold would be asleep. No one cared about anything - they did as they pleased.  I would faithfully go about my business, not worrying about this.  When I returned home in the evening, everything would be a holy mess.  I would then get on to setting right whatever had to be set right, with always a silent prayer to God, to better the situation. \n\nApparently God turned a deaf ear, as I landed up with a husband and children who also turned out to be like my parents. Everyone around me gets lazy and irresponsible -  I have to make up for all their short-comings, to hold on to a family.  This sustained attitude of others has taken its toll on me finally.  I have become frustrated and depressed.  What I would not give for a single soul in this house to be normal.  An ache which is never going to go away, until death do us part. \n\nNow, what gives people the right to do this to others and on top of that have no remorse.  I have been foolish and stupid, slogging around perfectly normal people for years that I have become the official laborer in my house. I love my family a lot, but I think I have over done my part.  I am caught in this mesh, a mesh everyone in my family wants me to be in, they do not want to give me a helping hand to extricate myself, as it would mean that they would have to turn around their life; which they are not willing to do and so I am stuck. \n\nBut if you are young and you are caught in a situation like this, be a little self-fish and don't overdo. Don't be the first to take on responsibilities and be sure to protest loudly.  I had kept my mouth shut for too long, to reverse the situation, but you can learn from my mistake and turn around  your life, so that you don't land up like me. \n\nBut, if you have a good supportive family, be sure to give a helping hand, be appreciative, do not take things for granted; for if you do, some day, for sure you will lose them.  \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:43.166+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "693e50b652cea1013f2a8e34e62dfd21b76702ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCsFiBj_rBdyp4XkBD2TgpyaTEqsQPj_hTj4nUSmdS4YFzPs5Dpm9MNS3nNeMiC.XRmdm7jhmBge_p6H.BpYLw", "site_full": "fotodiariosite.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://fotodiariosite.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Otxandio, 17-09-2017 \u2013 Argazkiak", "title": "Otxandio, 17-09-2017", "title_full": "Otxandio, 17-09-2017", "published": "2017-12-07T08:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "693e50b652cea1013f2a8e34e62dfd21b76702ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCsFiBj_rBdyp4XkBD2TgpyaTEqsQPj_hTj4nUSmdS4YFzPs5Dpm9MNS3nNeMiC.XRmdm7jhmBge_p6H.BpYLw", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "eduartres", "published": "2017-12-07T08:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "Otxandio, 17-09-2017", "text": "\n \n \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:44.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae3fd0ca89626ca44bf046b2fc00fc2d85782d6e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUADytQw_wmSTuvbNgVIh9DVbxW5O0UXneDY5I.8yYU0mZW3_MDAWvMPGl5tDa6025wXvc703MemaRnWhAk3DSUjhtoHfFqBKiRm13Rn2TZ_w--", "site_full": "naijaloveinfo.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://naijaloveinfo.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Naijaloveinfo", "title": "See Photo Of Black Man Who Narrated His Shocking Experience With White Lady Who Thought He Couldn't Afford A First Class Ticket", "title_full": "See Photo Of Black Man Who Narrated His Shocking Experience With White Lady Who Thought He Couldn't Afford A First Class Ticket", "published": "2017-12-07T11:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae3fd0ca89626ca44bf046b2fc00fc2d85782d6e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUADytQw_wmSTuvbNgVIh9DVbxW5O0UXneDY5I.8yYU0mZW3_MDAWvMPGl5tDa6025wXvc703MemaRnWhAk3DSUjhtoHfFqBKiRm13Rn2TZ_w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "naijalove info (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "See Photo Of Black Man Who Narrated His Shocking Experience With White Lady Who Thought He Couldn't Afford A First Class Ticket", "text": "A black man by the name Emmit Walker took to Facebook to narrate his shocking encounter with a racist white woman who couldn\u2019t comprehend how he could afford a first class ticket and tried to get him to leave the line.

Knowing how to beat cravings means understanding why you have them in the first place. \nThe food we eat influences our emotions. They have the ability to make us feel happy, depressed, anxious or calm, because certain foods trigger a release of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters, and they in turn control appetite and behaviour. \n\nThose dreaded carbs, for example, trigger a release of serotonin, the brain\u2019s \u2018happy chemical\u2019. Protein, on the other hand, releases dopamine and noradrenaline, which spike energy levels. \nJoburg dietician Sue Scharf agrees. \u201cA burning desire for a particular foodstuff is frequently linked to our emotions,\u201d she says. \nOn that note: Warm tummies with delicious chocolate banana bread \nYet it can also point to an underlying medical issue, like an iron deficiency or diabetes, where the urge to eat certain foods is actually linked to a sugar imbalance. \u201cIf you have a natural predisposition to depression, blood sugar fluctuations will aggravate the condition,\u201d she adds. \n\nSo what does it mean when you guzzle a packet of potato crisps or a slab of chocolate? This is what your body may be trying to tell you: \nChocolate: you may lack magnesium, which is essential for nerve function. You may also crave it when you\u2019re down, or when you\u2019re feeling \u2018hormonal\u2019 during your menstrual cycle. \nSalty foods: if there is no medical reason for it, a craving for salty food can be caused by stress, anger or frustration.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sue scharf", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "joburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:44.191+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8e564e4ce109c9a23a0ea72554643e25a17e194d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvpVW6t3vTV8s.RXZ_kWlyTmN6U9zHX.GI2BJYPyD84uKgjHborNhzxQlTFFmpSkIMLWwX4u.dy_uS7FxvT0nklP.yLPEEn7ATPAs1AmjSoBvYDkvwGW5UA", "site_full": "margaretsdesignercards.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://margaretsdesignercards.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Margarets Designer Cards", "title": "CD Sunday Challenge - Christmas Present", "title_full": "CD Sunday Challenge - Christmas Present", "published": "2017-12-03T10:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb7c8273dd107c8fc0432fe7932c95a075cf9190", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvpVW6t3vTV8s.RXZ_kWlyTmN6U9zHX.GI2BJYPyD84uKgjHborNhzxQlTFFmpSkIMLWwX4u.dy_uS7FxvT0nklP.yLPEEn7ATPAs1AmjSoBpwCexTjztmVe7hNxmUJk7A-", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "cotnob", "published": "2017-12-06T23:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "A fabulous card Margaret, such a brilliant design - a great idea.\nPauline - Crafting with Cotnob \nx", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:44.192+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b39be41ed63d9c2cb2182f7e1ec88804f525049", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQDwEeUGv6ok5nDojdw_GgS_Ob22J1BzRlmkTXzx4WQK2EUb4n_tGGDLLB0FysUqCWlPxOvxLaQ9svkMdeOn8CQuLKj0VALMCTk8G_JimTURB4JHkCJ7TQ9", "site_full": "www.watchlistnews.com", "site": "watchlistnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.watchlistnews.com//rss/", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "Watch List News", "title": "Axis Capital (AXS) Hits New 1-Year Low at $50.30", "title_full": "Axis Capital (AXS) Hits New 1-Year Low at $50.30", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/axis-capital-holdings-ltd-logo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b39be41ed63d9c2cb2182f7e1ec88804f525049", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQDwEeUGv6ok5nDojdw_GgS_Ob22J1BzRlmkTXzx4WQK2EUb4n_tGGDLLB0FysUqCWlPxOvxLaQ9svkMdeOn8CQuLKj0VALMCTk8G_JimTURB4JHkCJ7TQ9", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lindsey Winhoffer", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "Axis Capital (AXS) Hits New 1-Year Low at $50.30", "text": "Tweet \nShares of Axis Capital Holdings Limited (NYSE:AXS) hit a new 52-week low on Tuesday .

Josh does what he does and it allows Pat and I to bowl as fast as we can.\" \nAustralia's well-rounded bowling department has fully justified the decision by national selectors not to include an all-rounder in the squad until now, with Mitch Marsh to join the camp in Perth. He could potentially make a return to the Test XI in place of a struggling Peter Handscomb. \nThanks to the complementary roles played by the Australian quartet in repeatedly dismantling England, they haven't needed a fourth seamer. \nLyon has been almost impossible for England's batsmen to get away, rocking them with over-spin and turn, Cummins has bowled with great control as well as pace, Starc has made in-roads with the new ball and taken down the tail and Hazlewood rose to the challenge on the last day in Adelaide, bowling faster than he ever had to be Australia's man of the hour. \nThere is more bad news for England. \n\"The exciting thing is I think our bowling group can still get better,\" Starc warned. \n\"I think we've obviously managed to take 40 wickets in the last couple of weeks and do a lot of good things, but I think there is still room for improvement. \n\"I think the fact that we've all sort of grown up together \u2013 well, Patty, Josh and I \u2013 we've been around each other for a long time. We spend so much time off the field as a group as well. We're really close mates. I think that shows in the way we play our cricket.

They're too busy counting adjectives' \n\n\nLaura Barnett\nTuesday 21 July 2009 00.05 BST \n\n\n\nWhat got you started? My parents. Both were teachers, and they believed poetry was a vital part of what you could offer kids. We had poems floating around the house, either on the shelves, or on vinyl and tapes \u2013 recordings of Dylan Thomas, Richard Burton and Robert Graves. What was your big breakthrough? Seeing my play Backbone put on at the Royal Court theatre in London in 1969, when I was still at university. I was overwhelmed: I'd sit in the audience, not quite knowing why I was there. What one piece of music would feature on the soundtrack to your life? Miles Davis's Freddie Freeloader. It gets your goosepimples going. Is there  a lot of backstabbing in the poetry world? Not in the children's poetry world \u2013 but yes, in the adult world. I was stunned by that whole Oxford poetry thing [the row between poets Derek Walcott and Ruth Padel]. It can't possibly matter that much. I was once involved in similar silliness myself, and Roger McGough put me down and said: \"Is it good for poetry? If it isn't, shush.\" He was quite right. What's the greatest threat to poetry today? Comprehension questions in schools. Kids don't get the chance to get up and perform poetry, and enjoy it, because they're too busy counting adjectives and spotting metaphors. What advice would you give a young poet? Keep reading and listening to other poets. Don't think you've cracked it, because you never have. Is there an art form you don't relate to? Classical ballet. I can't see the emotion behind the movements; all I can see is pointy toes. What work of art would you most like to own? Netherlandish Proverbs, the painting by Bruegel. It was on our wall when I was a kid. It's such a wonderful idea: a visual manifestation of the oral wisdom of the people through their proverbs. What's the best advice anyone ever gave you? I used to show my dad a poem and he'd go: \"Hmm, keep writing, lad.\" He was absolutely right: you have to keep bashing away at it. What's the biggest myth about poetry? That all of it is too hard. Some of it is \u2013 if you dive straight into Paradise Lost, it's pretty difficult \u2013 but not all of it. What's the worst thing anyone has ever said about you? A critic once described me as a \"mere entertainer\". But I didn't take it as an insult \u2013 being an entertainer is incredibly difficult. Is there anything about your career you regret? No, no, no. I've been just so crazily fortunate. In short Born: Harrow, 1946. Career: Has published more than 140 books. Was appointed children's laureate in 2007. The stage adaptation of his book We're Going On a Bear Hunt is at the Duchess, London WC2 (0844 412 4659), until 16 August. High point: \"Being given the laureateship.\" Low point: \"In 1990, when the big conglomerates moved into the children's book world, and I saw five of my titles wiped out overnight.\" \n\nTHE GUARDIAN \n\n\n\nKISS \nPortrait of the artist / Liz Lochhead / \"Do better next time\" Portrait of the artist / John Cooper Clarke / At heart, I'm just a frustrated playboy Portrait of the artist / Alice Oswald / 'As a child, I wrote in a little notebook I hid in a bush' Portrait of the artist / Lemn Sissay / 'An artist doesn't need to suffer to create' \nDRAGON 001  Portrait of the artist / Will Alsop / 'I've learned never to trust anyone with big feet and a small head' \nPortrait of the artist / Jane Birkin / 'I was at the wrong audition, but Graham Greene still gave me my big break' \nPortrait of the artist / Vanessa Paradis/ 'I was only a teenager when I started out in the music industry.
