The 1968 album got off to a staggering start and peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200. Astoundingly good for a band that had been utterly unknown in the U.S. just six months earlier\nTruth was critically acclaimed for its daring, radical nature, elements of which would be appropriated by practically every metal band that followed. The recording is certainly regarded as a seminal work of heavy metal because of its use of blues toward a hard rock approach.\nThe combination of the wailing, heart-stoppingly dramatic vocalizing by Stewart , the thunderous rhythm section of Ron Wood 's bass, Mickey Waller 's drums, and Beck 's blistering lead guitar, which sounds like his amp is turned up to 13 and ready to short out, was as groundbreaking and influential a record as the first Beatles , Rolling Stones , or Who albums.\nThere are lots of unexpected moments on this record: It opens with an oldie done in a new way - a cover of The Yardbirds 1966 hit \" Shapes Of Things \". Then their brilliant blues-rock cover of Howlin' Wolf 's \" You Shook Me \"; Beck 's speaker-to-speaker guitar slides and Rod 's vocals are truly awesome and worth the price of admission on a version of Jerome Kern 's \" Ol' Man River \" done as a slow electric blues; a brief plunge into folk territory with a solo acoustic guitar version of \" Greensleeves \"; the progressive blues of \" Beck's Bolero \"; the extended live \" Blues Deluxe \"; and \" I Ain't Superstitious ,\" a blazing reworking of another Willie Dixon song closes the album.

With uninterrupted pan and zoom capabilities, Nearmap Panorama allows you to visualize reality, inspect remotely, create stunning proposals and analyze detailed ground features. \nNow users can export our imagery with measurements added. The saved image provides the whole picture, which is very useful in proposal development and communicating specific aspects of the aerial maps essential in planning and operations. \nOur users can inspect aerial location content faster than ever before using Nearmap Panorama. Consistent with past location content, Nearmap Panorama is delivered in high-resolution, 3-inch GSD. \nNearmap Oblique images are non-vertical views across multiple view-angles and cardinal directions, enabling users to interactively inspect and measure the height of features, such as buildings and terrain. These images give the user the ability to see the imagery as if looking directly from the aircraft \u2013 minimizing occluded (blocked) views and the ability to measure the heights of features such as buildings or towers. \nWith Nearmap Oblique images, government organizations conducting property appraisal can accurately value property using measurement and detailed, tilt-angled perspectives. At the same time, commercial organizations interested in engineering and construction can quickly select a north, south, east or west orientation, measure heights of buildings and better plan changes. \nLearn more about the launch here . \nFor specifications of Nearmap Panorama, click here .

I\u2019d prefer to coach a club again, but I won\u2019t exclude the possibility of coaching the national team one day. One thing is for certain: I won\u2019t be coaching again until June.\u201d \n\nWith Italy failing to qualify for next summer\u2019s World Cup, they have no official fixtures until next autumn, meaning the FIGC could afford to wait for Ancelotti. \n\nThat is what Roma captain Daniele De Rossi hopes will happen as he looks forward to the opportunity to work under a coach he says he has always admired. \n\n\u201cIt would be important, after the huge disappointment of the World Cup, if we start over with one of the most successful coaches in the world and with a fresh face like his, considering how everybody loves him,\u201d he told Mediaset. \n\nAncelotti then confirmed that he had tried to sign De Rossi in the past \u201cbut it was always impossible to lure him away from Rome.\u201d \n\nThe Roma midfielder joked that there was an ulterior motive behind Ancelotti\u2019s attempts to sign him. \n\n\u201cHe wanted me because he wanted to coach Roma, and maybe he just didn\u2019t want to have me at the Giallorossi when he arrived,\u201d De Rossi said after helping his club seal their qualification for the round of 16 of the Champions League.

The plastic adapters per se are simply placed on the stud weld, which has previously been attached to the unit; both can be screwed together using M6 x 10 hexagonal socket screws or half-round screws. Users therefore benefit from significant time savings, hence also cost savings, ease of use and improved flexibility in the assembly of profile rails. There is also much less need for time-consuming reworking of welding points. A further benefit lies in the fact that it is possible to ensure that the installed rails have a gap of approximately 1.5 millimetres from the substructure, eliminating the risk of through standing water. Two versions of plastic adapters are immediately available for insertion into the open ends of the profile rails. Apart from fixing individual rails in place, this also enables several rails to be connected to each other. Stud welding is used in many sectors as the most economical fastening method for components and is sometimes even the only technically feasible solution. As the entire surface of the copper-plated stud is jointed to the substructure, the connection is very strong. There is also minimal material distortion due to the short welding time, relatively low use of energy and isolated thermal stress, with the result that the system can also be used on comparatively thin-walled metal sheets and heat-resistant substrates. In addition to supplying the individual components \u2013 weld studs, a wide range of different clamp bodies and fastening hardware, including for clamping belts, cable ties or corrugated cable protection hoses \u2013 Stauff also offers the correspondingly designed assembly tools, including a weld inverter, weld gun with positioning tube, weld stud retainer and distance adapters. No high-voltage connection is required to use the simple and compact tool.

My main floor is all wood and tile in the kitchen and with 2 black cats the amount of hair and dust can be more than anyone would want. So I decided to take a chance on the V3S iLIFE, the vacuum is a good size, with a low profile so it fits under my couches. Not as loud as a normal vacuum of course which is nice too.\nSetting it up is very straightforward. I kind of wish it could be controlled via my iPhone or even by Alexa or Siri but for the price it's hard to complain. The full run time is about 1.5 to 2 hours. The first time I ran it the dust and hair collector was absolutely full..in fact for the first 3 or 4 times I ran it the compartment was completely full! I was really impressed and the house definitely looked and felt cleaner.\nIt did fall down the basement steps once which I think was a lighting issue that must have fooled its edge detection sensor. The remote control lost its memory settings as well. I just switch it on before I go to work now and it's working fine with no issues.\nOverall, easy to recommend. If it broke today, I'd probably buy another. stars: 4", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:27.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe97632416a9c41824f336241182489e0da01353", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYNtGt1pOaY6WrUwIiGs2t4rhvx0umE0rcxt9EUjotu_isqu.Uls5k6btfQdo0jsIFQFh3ca52O8b.BBN16QhI5jTzQwESYC8.oC3SgTq61d7tRcRBpSZdNujiPMHFf_n2", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.co.uk", "site": "tripadvisor.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowForum-g293939-i9162-Cambodia.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Cambodia Forum, Travel Discussion for Cambodia - TripAdvisor", "title": "Visa for Canadians - Siem Reap", "title_full": "Visa for Canadians - Siem Reap Message Board - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-06T11:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1071, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c56d7bd3e73a2dbe2409e98823235d6d4f3ebd1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYNtGt1pOaY6WrUwIiGs2t4rhvx0umE0rcxt9EUjotu_isqu.Uls5k6btfQdo0jsIFQFh3ca52O8b.BBN16QhI5jTzQwESYC8.oC3SgTq61d7tRcRBpSZdNvImJl5o15dFKrvcfOp9cLU-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "lennybruce", "published": "2017-12-06T11:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "That is the only official govt website for the evisa.

Republicans need Democratic votes in the Senate in order to fund the government because 60 votes are needed to advance spending measures in the upper chamber, where Republicans only have 52 members. \nDoes Jim Rickards expect a shutdown Friday?

I have a pet that sheds a lot, and I am physically unable to keep up with the vacuuming and sweeping required. This little robot has been a game changer! I can keep my home pet hair free now. The battery will last about 1.5 hours, which is enough time to pass over all 600 square feet of my apartment several times. It recharges pretty fast, too. It's path is totally random though. It makes it back to the charging base on its own about 50% of the time. Most of the time it fails because it can't figure out how to get around the walls and chairs, but sometimes its because it gets stuck somewhere. It's really important to make sure it doesn't encounter any cords or strings of anykind, and it is powerful enough to roll right over certain objects like floor lamp bases or the dog's food bowl and get stuck, so it's better to supervise. It also requires some basic maintenance, making sure hair isn't tangled around the brushes and washing the mop cloth regularily. The timer has to be reset each time, and it's not clear when it is actually set or not. I keep a small vacuum/broom for areas it can't reach, like between couch cushions or the tight space around the toilet for example, but the iLife does 99% of my vacuuming for me, and it's made my life SO MUCH EASIER. Kinda wished I had spent a bit more and got the one with the water tank in hindsight. Oh, and my dog has zero fear of it, which is nice.

Smoking During Pregnancy Can Increase Asthma Risk In Babies Mums-to-be, exposure to cigarette smoke during pregnancy can increase asthma risk in your baby. By: DoctorNDTV | Updated: Dec 7, 2017 12:48 IST 2-Min Read \nSmoking during pregnancy can be fatal for you and your baby HIGHLIGHTS Smoking during pregnancy can increase asthma risk in the baby It reduces oxygen supply for you and your baby It leads to increased risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome \nAny form of exposure to cigarette smoke during pregnancy or when the baby is three to 15 months old, asthma and wheeze risk in babies' increases, a new study suggests. The study was conducted on 376 new born babies and detailed information on the exposure to smoke during pregnancy and in home when the baby was three to 15 months old was obtained from the parents. \nTill six years of age, asthma, wheezing and demographic data was obtained with the help of yearly questionnaires. Dr Philip Pattemore University of Otago Christchurch, in New Zealand was the lead author of this study. He explained that hair nicotine increases everyday with cigarette smoking in the house and was strongly linked with pregnancy smoking. \nThough the overall hair nicotine was quite low in the participants, higher hair nicotine levels was strongly linked with an increased risk of wheeze and asthma at an age of just 15 months. At older ages, these associations were not quite significant. The research was published in the journal of Pediatric Pulmonology. \nHere's how smoking during pregnancy can affect your baby: \n1. It reduces oxygen supply for you and your baby \n2. The baby's heart rate increases \n3. Miscarriage and stillbirth risk is increased \n4. Risk of premature birth and low birth weight increases \n5. Baby's respiratory development gets disturbed \n6. Disorders in your baby like learning disorders and behavioural issues \n7. Placental abruption leading to excess bleeding which is life-threatening for the mother and the baby \n8. Disrupted structure of the heart and congenital heart defects in the baby \n9.

No matter how many years later, I will still get the same set of emotions I felt, as if it was just yesterday when I felt that way. It is like the smell of chopped garlic on my fingers that refuse to go off no matter how many times I wash my hands, the lingering scent of a woman\u2019s perfume on the seat belt that never goes away, or the faint scent of shampoo on pillowcases that aren\u2019t really there but yet definitely there. They just stay. Stubbornly so. Hauntingly so.\nThese days, I find myself at the cross road more often than I have ever been, more often than I expect to, and definitely more often than I want to. I wonder if I am going around in circles, hence the multiple cross roads.\nAnd some times, I find it hard to tell how I am feeling. I literally can choose to feel what I want to feel. That is a good thing but somehow, I feel a little less human that way.\nIt also means that I can switch off my feelings in an instant.\nPerhaps that\u2019s my super power?\n*flex muscle \nThat\u2019s all for today.\n \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:28.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15cadca811933018ccfd3051ccefd8ed48ada4ad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ50HWkEALmJMhgrQ5d93EilL3B29ELNT2tB5Eehjds8T5hCaP4TNQcQPLgbM6FP5j263b5AI6zSw--", "site_full": "thefiringline.com", "site": "thefiringline.com", "site_section": "https://thefiringline.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=29", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "The Skunkworks - The Firing Line Forums", "title": "mercury recoil reducers", "title_full": "mercury recoil reducers - The Firing Line Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T13:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 32529, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "39e39dd3686d96b1d2e924a386a7ca39bfa26dce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ50HWkEALmJMhgrQ5d93EilL3B29ELNT2tB5Eehjds8T5hCaP4TNQcQPLgbM6FP5iPqmtH_hoDucA9E2VP0k93", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "jmr40", "published": "2017-12-06T07:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I had a Benelli Nova for a while that had one.

It is great honor to introduce myself. I am here to make a speech about the distinctive and positive aspects of my department.\nWhat if all of people play a violine or piano only,there will be no beautiful harmonylike the New York Philharmonic. Management is like a conductor of an orchestra. The conductor is responsible for understanding the individual characters of the players and their instruments. The conductor corrects musical errors and harmonizes their playing. Especially, it is the conductor's main role to maximize the art of the entire musical melody. The same principle can also be applied in a soccer game. What if all the players want to be a kicker only? Their team will never win. That is why management is necessary and why we need our department. Now,let me describe in detail\nIf you become a member of the department of management,\n First, you can learn both management and engineering skills that are needed to run a business. Therefore, you will get the best chance to be a middle manager (or eventually CEO) in a small and medium sized company. The main duties of a middle manager in an organization involve conducting the strategic directives of upper-level managers at the operational level. It's also supervising subordinate employees to achieve goals of enterprise smoothly. Therefore, computer skills, documentation skills, leadership and communication skills are very important in this department.\nSecond, you will obtain many useful certificates for running business. For example, computer related certificates in our department are ITQ Excel, ITQ Powerpoint, and ITQ Hangeul. In addition, the national skill qualification certificates are Quality Management, Supply Chain Management, and Accounting. The Business English related certificates such as Trade English or TOEIC can also be obtained in our department. DIT(the short form of Dong-Eui Institute of Technology) certification indicates the standard of the alumni that guarantees successful employment in any companies. It has three main areas, that is, the basic knowledge, major subject, and professional liberal arts.\nThird, there are many work experience programs in this department. We have Industrial-Educational Cooperation Program that is highly active. It is supported by the extensive 83,000 alumni human network accumulated since it's established in 1973. During the vacation period, the senior students are given the opportunities to work various companies that are linked to the management department for four weeks.\nFor these reasons, if you join this department, I assure that you will become a successful manager. Thank you.\n(Source: Min Ji, presented at DIT English contest(12. 7))\n\u200b", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "min ji", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ji", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "industrial-educational cooperation program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dong-eui institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york philharmonic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:28.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "25dd6f5f065f7c33d7df957c139922365734cba1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94oobUZghFoTw56rYobx08LY.yK9ZTIJWw45A5D2w3POBoUgs2cy1jCCcKuHipJlSlOGvjmNwHJQIHqkXO6mFom.t2FihUnfyHabypkRjBoa6fOHDQxyC7C.BEyVSTxPBVChvV75uO0LeZzWIg8KIE0ebYV.zw4RvscblM8Q.dBp3mgymIbmsCm94-", "site_full": "www.amazon.co.uk", "site": "amazon.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nintendo-Switch-Stand-Lamicall-Adjustable-Black/product-reviews/B01MA4RAQF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: Nintendo Switch Stand, Lamicall Adjustable Tablet Stand : Desktop Playstand Holder Dock for Nintendo Switch, iPad Pro 10.5 / 9.7 / 12.9, iPad Air 2 3 4 mini, kindle, Nexus, Desk, Accessories, Tab and Other Tablets (4-11 inch) - Black", "title": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: Nintendo Switch Stand, Lamicall Adjustable Tablet Stand : Desktop Playstand Holder Dock for Nintendo Switch, iPad Pro 10.5 / 9.7 / 12.9, iPad Air 2 3 4 mini, kindle, Nexus, Desk, Accessories, Tab and Other Tablets (4-11 inch) - Red", "title_full": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: Nintendo Switch Stand, Lamicall Adjustable Tablet Stand : Desktop Playstand Holder Dock for Nintendo Switch, iPad Pro 10.5 / 9.7 / 12.9, iPad Air 2 3 4 mini, kindle, Nexus, Desk, Accessories, Tab and Other Tablets (4-11 inch) - Red", "published": "2017-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ddfc67851d14336d5a1b0804905e35803468ad7f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94oobUZghFoTw56rYobx08LY.yK9ZTIJWw45A5D2w3POBoUgs2cy1jCCcKuHipJlSlOGvjmNwHJQIHqkXO6mFom.t2FihUnfyHabypkRjBoa6fOHDQxyC7C.BEyVSTxPBVChvV75uO0LeZzWIg8KIE0ebYV.zw4RvscblM8Q.dBp3merPVl8hUNVk7nBaADIDmv4GyBJ.DDvkGWv7Y7IwJ.lwKxrng.VnYgg--", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Amazon Customer", "published": "2017-11-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Awesome stand!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:28.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eeb0e2938a0d510284e1d289d63f120cf6686c3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94ovt4PONVnaoyS0xf6JtAokzbNEN4oTcb3jdbvgEGVSDLBaTTdvUhOIAY_bPgln_vi6cGT7M_coX6gMoUqmSi4PjXmXthHFnVqXqUbQAX.id.zkGWkcU5DBpoptza4RK22p46ZXga9aw2iOV7huHa6A50Qib1pwO5n6t.YbaTS.Ut", "site_full": "www.amazon.ca", "site": "amazon.ca", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product-reviews/B00499UODQ/ref=s9_acsd_top_hd_bw_b2QVn1P_c_x_20_w?pf_rd_m=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-4&pf_rd_r=XSG38ZQXXJFCF6Q3VTVK&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=853290bb-2520-5c05-913e-799ae0c0f7b0&pf_rd_i=2224027011", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Adams Christmas 5730-06-1240 Safety Grip Stocking Hook, 2-Pack", "title": "Adams Christmas 5730-06-1240 Safety Grip Hook, 2-Pack", "title_full": "Amazon.ca:Customer reviews: Adams Christmas 5730-06-1240 Safety Grip Stocking Hook, 2-Pack", "published": "2016-12-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "994e178b999721206b81cacf439989cc32d6c63b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94ovt4PONVnaoyS0xf6JtAokzbNEN4oTcb3jdbvgEGVSDLBaTTdvUhOIAY_bPgln_vi6cGT7M_coX6gMoUqmSi4PjXmXthHFnVqXqUbQAX.id.zkGWkcU5DBpoptza4RK22p46ZXga9aw2iOV7huHa6A50Qib1pwO5n_MflVcD4i.x", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Karine Dubois", "published": "2017-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "They don\u2019t look as nice as the heavy ones but the do the job and are much safer for young children.

The report says the plan was pitched as a way to counter \u201cdeep state\u201d enemies in the intelligence community seeking to undermine Trump\u2019s presidency. \nThe report quotes a \u201cformer senior U.S. intelligence official with firsthand knowledge of the proposals,\u201d who said: \u201c [CIA Director Mike] Pompeo can\u2019t trust the CIA bureaucracy, so we need to create this thing that reports just directly to him. It is a direct-action arm, totally off the books. The whole point is this is supposed to report to the president and Pompeo directly.\u201d \nThe proposal would mean these \u201cprivate spies\u201d would not share their intelligence with the rest of the intelligence community, but rather with only the president and Pompeo.

Candidates who appeared for the exam will need to login to their account on CAT 2017 website created at the time of registration. There they could access the question paper, answer key and the objection form. Candidates are advised to go through the question paper and key carefully and only then resort to submitting their respective objections. Candidates will have to pay Rs. 1000 for each objection submitted. This is new venture by IIMs to make the selection procedure more transparent. This way the candidates will be able to estimate their probable score before the final result is released in January 2018. The facility to submit objections is also new and is an appreciable effort on the part of IIM Lucknow. The score for each participant will be calculated as according to the marking scheme revealed by IIM Lucknow earlier. After the result for CAT 2017 is announced, candidates who get a call from the IIMs will have to appear for WAT and PI rounds. The selection in IIMs is not entirely dependent on the score in CAT exam and certain weightage is also assigned to a candidate's past academic record, ECA activities, work experience etc. Click here for more Education News Trending", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "iim lucknow", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eca", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lucknow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:29.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "998525327074fc78ea6ee67fe22a6cfbe6df32ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JFWgldW61hct.MNlZR20Q8aciZ6BVGilfvSXQbOQX8Squ3ocPEvq4rGb0CRoVTVk1aWUhjirqLjcTeDvaB_EPATsk2Hnfx04QYgF4lIE7POaCvdy3z4NecYLgaPRzR0oleOzBTCUBpuQ--", "site_full": "eccalifornian.com", "site": "eccalifornian.com", "site_section": "http://eccalifornian.com/rss/articles", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "East County Californian Articles", "title": "Annual Cowboy Christmas fundraiser kicks off holiday celebrations at Olaf Wieghorst", "title_full": "Annual Cowboy Christmas fundraiser kicks off holiday celebrations at Olaf Wieghorst", "published": "2017-12-06T19:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "998525327074fc78ea6ee67fe22a6cfbe6df32ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JFWgldW61hct.MNlZR20Q8aciZ6BVGilfvSXQbOQX8Squ3ocPEvq4rGb0CRoVTVk1aWUhjirqLjcTeDvaB_EPATsk2Hnfx04QYgF4lIE7POaCvdy3z4NecYLgaPRzR0oleOzBTCUBpuQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ecc", "published": "2017-12-06T19:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "Annual Cowboy Christmas fundraiser kicks off holiday celebrations at Olaf Wieghorst", "text": "BJ Coleman  19pm \u201cCowboy Christmas\u201d came to downtown El Cajon on Nov. 30, at the Olaf Wieghorst Museum, for a midday gathering in Old West style celebration of the late-year holidays. The event was replete with Westerners, including a special appearance from Cowboy Santa, who sat for photos with wine social luncheon guests of arts patrons and supporters of the Western museum, and cowboy members of the Olaf Wieghorst Posse. Earlene Hollmichel, executive director, explained that this fundraising event is a popular one on the Western heritage arts and culture museum\u2019s annual schedule. \u201cThis event starts the holidays,\u201d Hollmichel said. \u201cThe champagne and wine social luncheon used to be mostly all women, but now men attend too. Members of the museum board and other supporters are asked to be in Olaf\u2019s Posse, and these guys in the posse provide the half-time show during the lunch and help with the live auction and presentation of opportunity drawing and Chinese auction winners.\u201d Raffle prizes were holiday- and museum-relevant, with Christmas decorations and Christmas plates, gift baskets, comfort item collections, artworks, and wines with serving sets. The event kicked off at 11 a.m. for three hours of lots of Western fun and fundraising. \u201cThis is my favorite event of the year,\u201d said Monica Zech, public information officer for the City of El Cajon, as she walked among the lobby display of raffle items. \u201cThe museum itself is a wonderful part of the history of El Cajon, celebrating an artist who lived here. This is a big star right here in the heart of El Cajon.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for about 12 years,\u201d Hollmichel said. \u201cThis is a fun event, and we always stage this before the Christmas rush.\u201d The museum is currently hosting a show of artworks from six local artists, which will run through January. \u201cWe really want to say thank you to our posse,\u201d Hollmichel said. Olaf\u2019s Posse members plied the ladies and gentlemen by filling glasses of wine and champagne, before they repaired to the museum lobby to reload with humorous poems and stories for the half-time entertainment show. Posse member Jim Daniels promised \u201cdignity, class, culture and panache.\u201d Uh huh. The posse member turns at the podium were punny, modestly self-deprecating, and wildly funny. John Stauffer, current president of the museum board, led the posse. Stauffer described the event\u2019s history briefly, noting that each year around 60 to 70 attend, with 65 signed up for 2017\u2019s Cowboy Christmas wine social lunch. This event usually brings in $3,000-4,000 to support museum programs. Stauffer further said that this is a fun one, but not the biggest museum fundraiser of each year. The largest money-raising party at the museum is the Round Up, with the next one to be staged on May 5, 2018. The theme of that fundraiser is \u201cBring \u2018em Home,\u201d as a reunion party inviting long-lost museum patrons and supporters to come back again. Stauffer has been active in supporting the Wieghorst Museum for about 3.5 years. Stauffer is a professional woodworker who has built woodworks for the museum and crafted an artwork wine glasses display holder for donation to this year\u2019s fundraising. \u201cI got involved,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I learned there are so many good people here.\u201d Hollmichel and board members also wanted to remind Christmas shoppers that the Olaf Wieghorst Museum has a gift shop featuring Western jewelry, books, art reprints, hand-painted gourds, and ever-popular dream-catchers. The Olaf Wieghorst Museum is located at 131 Rea Avenue in El Cajon. Information is available by phoning (619) 590-3431 or by researching online at www.wieghorstmuseum.org.

All India | \u00a9 2017 Bloomberg L.P | Saritha Rai, Bloomberg | Updated: December 07, 2017 14:40 IST Share COMMENTS Nandan Nilekani wants to ensure that Infosys employees have the opportunity to learn and re-invent. Infosys Ltd.'s plan to turn disruption to its advantage by focusing on newer digital technologies will begin showing results in the coming financial year, according to billionaire co-founder and Chairman Nandan Nilekani.Client offerings positioned around cutting edge technologies like artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things will help make Infosys much stronger, Nilekani said in his first interview since taking on the chairman's role in August.While the rest of the world may see Infosys as a troubled outsourcer that is past its prime, Nilekani sees an opportunity for Asia's second-largest IT services company to reclaim glory. But it's not going to be easy after a calamitous year that saw management clash with his fellow founders and the abrupt exit of Silicon Valley-based Chief Executive Officer Vishal Sikka. Days ago the company named Salil Parekh, a top executive from a European rival, as its new CEO.\"The world and its businesses are in the midst of the biggest re-imagining and transformation I've seen in the last 40 years, offering us a huge opportunity,\" Nilekani said. \"Our goal is to make sure we are positioned to deliver, so that we'll again be in the right place at the right time,\" he said, \"We just have to do it.\" Infosys was built into a global brand by employing bright engineers to cater to global corporations. The billionaire, who returned after an eight-year gap, is a man on a mission as Infosys tackles the challenge of reinvention in an outsourcing industry facing slower growth and narrower margins. It must also contend with the Trump administration's tightening controls over the worker visa program that the industry relies on.Bangalore-based Infosys was founded by a cohort of middle-class engineers in 1981 with $200 of their savings. They built the company into a global brand by employing thousands of bright, relatively low-salaried engineers to cater to global corporations like Citigroup Inc, Microsoft Corp and Deutsche Bank AG. Revenue, profits and headcount all grew in the double digits.But as technological change sweeps through industries from retail to financial services, clients are demanding that outsourcers automate mundane tasks while helping them transform into digital businesses.\"There's a large opportunity out there helping global clients re-imagine their business, it's opportunity of a new kind,\" said Nilekani. One such client request was to use natural language processing and AI to make mortgage processing more efficient in mitigating risk.\"A lot of things we do are subject to commoditization and automation,\" he said at his sprawling house in Bangalore's Koramangala neighborhood, an area dubbed Billionaire's Row and where fellow Infosys founder Kris Gopalakrishnan has a home. \"We need to make our new businesses grow quickly with bigger margins - we need to manage both these things well.\"Much of the strategy and execution plans have already been discussed with Parekh, who is joining the company in January from Capgemini SA. The new CEO will have a quarter to settle in and adjust plans but Nilekani expects everyone to be \"fully aligned\" by the time the new fiscal year kicks off in April.While Parekh has been appointed for a five-year term, he will have to hit the ground running. His chairman detailed a busy early schedule, with an employee townhall, strategy meetings, and convening with senior executives and the board within days of joining. The new CEO will then lead a delegation to the World Economic Forum at Davos and participate in an off-site strategy session. In between, he'll travel the world visiting offices and meeting key clients.\"We now have strategy that everybody buys in to, a new CEO and the focus is back on business,\" said Nilekani. \"Infosys is on the path to a really good performance in the coming financial year.\"Not everybody thinks it is a sure thing. It was only six weeks ago that Infosys slashed its sales growth forecast range to 6.5 to 7.5 percent in U.S. dollar terms, compared with a previous target of as much as 9.1 percent.Diviya Nagarajan, an analyst at UBS Securities India Pvt, said she would still \"view Infosys as a work in progress.\"Nilekani wants to ensure that every one of the 200,000 employees at Infosys has the opportunity to learn and re-invent themselves. With a future of \"extreme automation\" facing clients from financial services to retail, training workers on technologies such as AI and machine learning with anytime-anywhere access to tutorials will be crucial.\"Organizations with great talent, rapid learning systems that are quick to market and have a certain resilience - those will make the new outsourcing mode,\" he said. \"It will all still be based on global delivery because all the great talent is right here.\"Nilekani, whose consensus-building approach allowed him to easily switch from the corporate world to work with the government, insists that outsourcing is not a spent business model. He has chalked out a plan to continue as chairman for another year or more, helping the new CEO integrate as he looks to add board members with a deeper understanding of business and technology.Once all that is in place, he will make himself redundant.\"Infosys should be managed by professionals, founders can't keep coming back,\" he said. \"That can't be the Infosys model.\" (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)

So what little demand evidence we have says the Switch is selling better at launch than the Wii...\nBut yeah let's make up some horseshit about demand and talk about it anyway. Click to expand... Lets put things in perspective. Wii demand was based on one game, Wii Sports. The demand for that game caused the Wii to sell out for 3 years and then it started to lose interest. Demand like that will be unlikely to be seen again especially over one game. Click to expand... Wii Sports definitely helped a lot, but it was all based on the novelty and accessibility of motion controls. Anyone could pick up a controller and swing the golf club in Wii Sports. People I never heard talking about gaming ever now wanted one. You just don't have that now even with popular systems like the Switch and PS4. Click to expand...

The company is also touting the inclusion of its Beautify 3.0 app, for improved portraits. They both come with fingerprint sensors on the rear panel, forgoing the home button at the front completely. \nAs for storage, the Xiaomi Redmi 5 offers 16GB or 32GB of inbuilt storage, expandable via microSD card.

The ongoing Delhi Police Constable (Executive) Male and Female written exam conducted by the Staff Selection Commission, has witnessed a similar case. The written test, for the candidates who have qualified the PE&MT, is being held at 121 venues in 57 cities nationwide. The four day long exam, which began on 5 December 2017 has noticed a fake video claiming exam paper leakage in a certain venue at Delhi.Rubbishing the reports in the video, the Commission has urged candidates to restrain from following such misleading contents and has released an official notice in this regard. 'The Commission would like to categorically make it clear that this news item is totally baseless and misleading and that the Delhi Police Examination, 2016 is being conducted by SSC seamlessly throughout the Country.'The video, in discussion, is in fact an old ABP News Item of the year 2012. The 'YouTube' video states that 'there has been a leakage of the question paper of Delhi Police at a non-existent venue in Sector-1 Rohini, New Delhi. 'SSC has disallowed full sleeve clothes and shoes to the exam hall. 'Candidates should not wear charms, veil, items containing metals such as ring, bracelet, earrings, nose-pin, chains, necklace, pendants, badge, brooch, hair pin, hair band, clothes with full sleeves or big buttons, etc. Candidates are advised to wear open footwear like chappal, flotter, instead of shoes as the candidates would be asked to remove shoes by the frisking staff,' reads the official update by the Commission.Delhi Police Constable recruitment is being held for selecting candidates to 4722 vacancies. After selection, candidates will be appointed under revised Pay Scale after 7th CPC Pay Matrix Level - 03.

Thiruvananthapuram: The legal age for drinking will now be 23 years instead of 21 years, the Kerala government has said. To curb the problem of alcoholism in the state, the Left-led government of Pinari Vijayan has passed an Ordinance, raising the age bar for drinking. The Ordinance has been sent to Governor P Sathasivam for clearance.The average age of first exposure to alcohol in Kerala is said to be 14 years. Critics say the new rules will only make underage drinking secret.Kerala has started moving towards total prohibition under the earlier Congress-led government.The Oommen Chandy government, which had stopped granting liquor licences to all except Five-Star hotels, had said the state would be alcohol-free within a decade. Thousands of bars and pubs had been shut down across the state.Though the move was hailed by social activists, owners and workers in the liquor and hospitality industry started strong protests. Later, a drop in tourism, one of the mainstays of revenue for the state government, was also attributed to the ban.After the LDF government came to power earlier this year, it diluted the ban, allowing three-star hotels and resorts to sell alcohol. The government, however, said the minimum drinking age would be raised - a move that critics said was an effort to counter accusations of giving in to the liquor lobby.The Congress, which is now in the opposition, has called it a gimmick.\"During our time the total number of hotels that served liquor was just two dozen and today that number has dramatically gone up... raising the age to 23 is just an eye wash,\" senior Congress leader Joseph Vazhackan was quoted as saying by news agency IANS.
