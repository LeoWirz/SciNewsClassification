I do think that the U.S.'s unequivocal backing of Israel, no matter what actions it takes, has been counterproductive in reaching a peace agreement in the area. People make deals when they perceive the deal as being a better alternative than the risks they face if there is no deal. With the U.S.'s unequivocal backing, Israel doesn't have to face the risks of not making a deal. We should have taken a firm shot across the bow when Israel built it's first illegal settlement, and made it clear we would let them go it alone if another was built. But we've shielded the Israeli government from any consequences of building those settlements, and now the West Bank is carved up like swiss cheese with those settlements and transportation corridors.\nThe collective punishment being carried out in Gaza is inhumane and guarantees terrorist attacks for the foreseeable future. And the west bank is heading in that direction.\nI always admire your input and comments. They always sharpen my own thinking and leave me better informed after reading them. I find that we often agree more than we disagree, and that boosts my confidence that I might be getting close to the right track. I especially agree wholeheartedly with your last paragraph above.

Which Main Anxiety Causes Affect You? \nWe often don\u2019t realize that we\u2019re experiencing those underlying symptoms, and we don\u2019t always think about the following causes. Knowing these two main anxiety causes can help you identify and address them. Desire . \nWhen causing anxiety, desire goes deeper than materialism. Desire for smart home technology or a tropical vacation typically doesn\u2019t produce significant anxiety. Here, desire refers to something important that you want for yourself or your life. Perhaps you desire a career change that will take time and money. Or you want your relationship with your partner to be better, more loving and connected. \nThese are positive, healthy desires. Life goals and dreams don\u2019t always cause anxiety. They do cause anxiety you feel that, for whatever reason, they are out of reach. Quite often, what underlies this unmet desire is a lack of self-confidence . When people have goals but don\u2019t pursue them because they believe in many reasons why that can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t, this causes anxiety. \nThe best way to reduce anxiety that comes from unpursued desire is to determine your purpose (why you have this desire), then list reasons why you can and will pursue it. Finally, take action, even small steps, to move forward despite your anxiety about it. Unresolved issues. \nSometimes when people have vague but strong anxiety, it\u2019s linked to unresolved issues. People who hate confrontation will let relationship problems slide, for example. Yet these issues continue to build in the background, manifesting as anxiety. Or are you in a job you hate and feel stuck? Anything that is a problem for you that, perhaps for good reason, you\u2019re not admitting and dealing with can cause anxiety. \nYou can reduce anxiety by examining things in your life. Are there things that bother you? Are you doing anything about them? To help anxiety, start doing something about them . Taking small steps in the right direction will chip away at your anxiety. \nDo some reflecting to determine if desire or unresolved issuesare causing your anxiety. If so, making small, frequent lifestyle changes will go a long way in reducing anxiety and shrinking these causes of anxiety. Author: Tanya J. Peterson, MS, NCC \nTanya J.

On Monday, the Television Academy which gives out the Emmy Awards, voted to expel Weinstein for life. The producer, whose company is behind long running TV series like Project Runway, is linked to numerous sexual misconduct and rape cases. Access Hollywood adds that Weinstein's membership was also snatched from The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the producers guild.\nMedia: WochIt Media But it\u2019s unlikely that the Board will immediately sit down and consider the membership status of Kevin Spacey or Roman Polanski. An email to Academy members from CEO Dawn Hudson said that a task force headed by David Rubin will \u201cfinalize procedures for handling allegations of misconduct,\u201d and that the new procedures would be sent to members in 2018.\nThe standards, which were addressed by the AMPAS Board of Governors during its meetings in November and December, followed the October 14 expulsion of Weinstein from the Academy. It is only one part of an effort that is expected to encompass other programs that will be announced in the future. Producer Kathleen Kennedy, a member of the board, has proposed a commission to address the problem and establish a zero-tolerance policy for the industry.\nAlso Read: Motion Picture Academy Expels Harvey Weinstein\nThe standards were sent to the members on Wednesday evening in a link contained in an email from Hudson. The body of the email:\nLast night, our Board of Governors approved the Academy\u2019s Standards of Conduct, a statement of values that we expect our members to uphold. Please read it here. [LINK IS AVAILABLE TO MEMBERS ONLY.]\nOn behalf of the Governors, I want to thank the specially formed task force, led by Governor and Academy Officer David Rubin, whose members dedicated many hours of research and discussion to drafting this document and evaluating future steps. Over the course of weeks, the task force consulted with professors of ethics, business, philosophy, and law from Georgetown, Harvard, Notre Dame, and Stanford, as well as experts in human resources and sexual harassment. We met with our counterparts at the Television Academy and BAFTA, and, for reference, we also reviewed the codes of conduct of other organizations, including AFI, Film Independent, and UCLA.\nMuch remains to be done. The task force will finalize procedures for handling allegations of misconduct, assuring that we can address them fairly and expeditiously. This process will ultimately guide the Board of Governors in assessing if certain allegations warrant action regarding membership. Those procedures will be sent to you in the new year.\nWe are articulating these standards with the simple goal of fostering the kind of environment that enables and supports creativity, and furthers the Academy\u2019s mission.\nThe email linked to a statement which reads, in full:\nAcademy membership is a privilege offered to only a select few within the global community of filmmakers. In addition to achieving excellence in the field of motion picture arts and sciences, members must also behave ethically by upholding the Academy\u2019s values of respect for human dignity, inclusion and a supportive environment that fosters creativity. The Academy asks that members embrace their responsibility to affirm these principles and act when these principles are violated. There is no place in the Academy for people who abuse their status, power or influence in a manner that violates recognized standards of decency. The Academy is categorically opposed to any form of abuse, harassment or discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, disability, age, religion, or nationality. The Board of Governors believes that these standards are essential to the Academy\u2019s mission and reflective of our values.\nIf any member is found by the Board of Governors to have violated these standards or to have compromised the integrity of the Academy by their actions, the Board of Governors may take any disciplinary action permitted by the Academy\u2019s Bylaws, including suspension or expulsion.\nRead original story Academy Sets \u2018Standards of Conduct\u2019 in Wake of Sexual Misconduct Scandals At TheWrap", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Since the first edition, the quality of applications from all around Europe has been remarkably high, making the work of the Selection Committee difficult\u2026 and 2017 has been no exception. \nThis year's Committee, composed of European jurors, has decided to recognize the work of two young innovative and accomplished women dedicated to increasing awareness and improving the lives of people with diabetes: \nCristina Cucchiarelli, winner of the IDF Europe Prize for long-standing achievement and member of the National Italian Diabetes Association of people with diabetes (ANIAD) , is an inspiration for many in her country. As a professional athlete and a sports trainer with diabetes, she has a deep understanding of metabolic adaptation patterns during physical activity and has developed a specific training method for people with type 1 diabetes, achieving with great results. Her method, Pronking is based on bi-weekly trainings and provides a 40% average improvement of insulin sensitivity and daily insulin requirement. Her actions has contributed to increase the number of people who can balance their insulin therapy with the changing energy requirements. Cristina is also an active advocate for her association, especially at school camps. \nDr Shivani Misra , winner of the IDF Europe Prize for young researcher, is a bright young doctor and researcher with an impressive list of publications and invitations to national and international congresses. Dr Shivani Misra is investigating the phenotype of young-onset diabetes in different ethnic groups in the UK and she has been a dynamic force managing to set up, single-handedly, a large multi-centre national study that has recruited over 1100 participants from over 40 sites: the MY DIABETES study. This study is the first of its kind in the UK, recruiting people with young-onset diabetes from Caucasian, south Asian and African-Caribbean ethnicities. Though set up to identify the frequency and characteristics of monogenic diabetes, it also seeks to answer fundamental and important questions about Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in ethnic minorities, a completely unstudied area. Shivani's research is extremely impactful to ethnic minorities both in the UK and globally. Her findings will continue to shed light on the phenotypic differences between diabetes in different ethnic groups, with the aim of improving diabetes classification and treatment for people from ethnic groups. \nCristina and Shivani received their award and presented their activity during IDF Europe Regional Council which took place on December 3 in Abu Dhabi, ahead of the IDF World Diabetes Congress . \nCongratulations to the winners! \nEli Lilly and Company published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public,

the massive reception that greeted his arrival in Kano for a two-day working visit as a clear message to the opposition that his popularity in the region remains unshaken. According to a statement on Thursday by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the President spoke at a state dinner held in his honour on Wednesday. The President said results of 2003, 2007 and 2011 presidential elections all showed that Kano State remains his stronghold. He said, \u2018\u2018I am overwhelmed with the massive reception I have received and definitely since this is partisan politics, I think it has sent a clear message to the opposition. \u2018\u2018Even going by the details of the election results in 2003, 2007 and 2011, it was very clear that nobody could even dare to rig my scores from the elections in Kano. \u2018\u2018It has been so consistent and I don\u2019t think I have the vocabulary to express my thanks to the people of Kano. \u2018\u2018I am very grateful to God and the people of Kano for the complete trust you have in me,\u2019\u2019 he said. The President noted that during his drive around the city on Wednesday to inaugurate projects, he observed that many of those who thronged the road to welcome him were young people. He pledged that as a person in a position of authority, his priority is to provide a meaningful future for the teeming youths in the country through education, and the faithful management of the economy and resources. The President congratulated Governor Abdullahi Ganduje on his development strides in the state and urged other political office holders to emulate and support the state governor. \u2018\u2018He is a great politician and I am afraid I am still learning,\u2019\u2019 the President said. Buhari reaffirmed that his message at his inaugural address, \u201cI belong to everybody and I belong to nobody,\u2019\u2019 will continue to guide his stewardship to the Nigerian people. \u2018\u2018My problem is Nigeria and I have been involved in almost all the instability Nigeria experienced: the civil war, the coups, and counter-coups. That was why I said during my swearing-in that \u2018I belong to everybody and I belong to nobody.\u2019 \u2018\u2018Nigeria is my target and I will continue to maintain focus,\u2019\u2019 he said.

A Chinese gemological laboratory has identified a well-concealed synthetic-diamond coating that bolstered the size of a small natural stone. While the lower part of the stone was a colorless, natural diamond, the upper section, including the crown and the top of the pavilion, contained a layer of diamond created using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Although CVD coatings have been present in the industry for many years, \u201cCVD overgrowth, which significantly influences the weight and size of the diamond, is still rarely reported up to now,\u201d the Beijing-based National Gemstone Testing Center (NGTC), which detected the stone, said in a recent statement. While the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) earlier this year identified an overgrowth on a natural diamond that tinted it blue, the layer that the NGTC discovered is more concerning for the trade, the Chinese group explained. The coating over the brilliant-cut, 0.11-carat, near-colorless diamond was hard to detect, with no features betraying its existence visible using a microscope, the NGTC said. The layer it found was thicker, perhaps indicating an improvement in growth technique and, unlike in the GIA case, there were no blemishes on the stone resembling needle marks. NGTC gemologists were able to identify the overgrowth with spectroscopic analysis, as well as images taken using DiamondView technology.

During the summer of 1996 the duo was joined by singers/dancers Kim, Robin, Roy, and Denise, all of whom became full-time members of the group; with Danski and Delmundo locked in the studio, the four vocalists toured Europe under the Vengaboys name, followed in 1997 by the release of the single \"Up and Down.\" The follow-up \"We Like to Party! (The Vengabus)\" appeared in 1998, followed shortly by the full-length The Party Album, which also featured the hit single \"Boom Boom Boom Boom.\" The hit singles \"Kiss When the Sun Don't Shine,\"\"Shalala Lala,\" and \"Uncle John from Jamaica\" all landed on the 2000 effort The Platinum Album. After the release of their 2001 single \"Forever as One,\" a pregnant Denise left the group to tend to life as a new mother and the Vengaboys went on hiatus. In 2006 they returned with Donny Latupeirissa replacing Roy on a tour across Europe, but in 2010 their comeback began in earnest with the release of their single \"Rocket to Uranus.\" The song's accompanying 3-D video featured gossip columnist Perez Hilton, along with Euro-dance legend Pete Burns from the group Dead or Alive. In 2013, they released a cover of \"Hot Hot Hot,\" the classic soca hit from Arrow that had become a worldwide party favorite in 1987 thanks to a version by David Johansen in his Buster Poindexter persona. They released \"2 Brazil\" a year later to coincide with the 2014 World Cup, while the end of 2014 saw the group get in the holiday spirit with The Christmas Party Album, which featured the single \"Where Did My Xmas Tree Go?\" ~ Jason Ankeny Top Music Videos ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "delmundo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shalala lala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason ankeny top music videos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pete burns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buster poindexter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david johansen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perez hilton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donny latupeirissa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamaica", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:33.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f169870ae392e94d227c466e7836891d133b1ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DH4fzRhcB2ytt98jwIMLLbCodu83._HvLX5YQwnUU31HCiqnXXWdRv9xYIrETyimKKYDMyQfyr5qLu4G92h0PoB01GiJEOynURzvygX5uyXAuL.w.1Mj0RKQ--", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.co.uk", "site": "huffingtonpost.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/christmas/3/", "site_categories": ["politics", "financial_news", "law_government_and_politics", "finance"], "section_title": "Christmas | HuffPost UK", "title": "Mariah Carey Forced To Cancel Christmas Tour Shows Due To Illness", "title_full": "Mariah Carey Forced To Cancel Christmas Tour Shows Due To Illness", "published": "2017-11-16T15:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.huffingtonpost.com%2Fasset%2F1200_630%2F5a0d8d801800003300f6c7b2.jpeg%3Fcache%3DFfeWMQ1TcI&amp;client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&amp;signature=9c068210dd2f66761fca7f38101f34f0d6f83bfe", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3053, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a3521598db3b804ca0f7459585d41f51a67603f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DH4fzRhcB2ytt98jwIMLLbCodu83._HvLX5YQwnUU31HCiqnXXWdRv9xYIrETyimKKYDMyQfyr5qLu4G92h0PoB01GiJEOynURzvygX5uyXAubSdGXz5ixJskLHR7fat4X", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "Jonny Rimes", "published": "2017-11-17T13:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "no it's not, the term respiratory infection covers a lot of different things, laryngitis, strep throat, bronchitis etc.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:33.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "231184b72a5fa092713d64bcdff1006ee76c9a9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8E_G3Krxw.bIXNYc2hF5J.T4sCoQhch9bHVR70s8qP5uRLyBwdV5rp5wvjnH9_HTgzqlU4AHo37bGVKu97WPn81spJ2B.DZ_Y-", "site_full": "www.heatingandventilating.net", "site": "heatingandventilating.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["home_and_garden", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "GF Piping Systems holds skyscraper seminar", "title_full": "GF Piping Systems holds skyscraper seminar", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.797, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "231184b72a5fa092713d64bcdff1006ee76c9a9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8E_G3Krxw.bIXNYc2hF5J.T4sCoQhch9bHVR70s8qP5uRLyBwdV5rp5wvjnH9_HTgzqlU4AHo37bGVKu97WPn81spJ2B.DZ_Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "GF Piping Systems holds skyscraper seminar", "text": "Latest News GF Piping Systems holds skyscraper seminar \nAlready recognised as a leader in building services solutions for high rise properties thanks to its \u201cBig in the City\u201d campaign, GF Piping Systems recently staged a seminar in London to raise awareness of the opportunities presented by the multiple UK sites where tall structures are planned. GF Piping Systems held a seminar to increase understanding of the opportunities available at sites where tall buildings have been planned. \nThe event at the Building Centre offered specialist contractors, stockists and sector journalists an insight into how GF\u2019s comprehensive product portfolio can provide cost effective solutions. \nGF Piping Systems\u2019 sales director for South East and South West, Mark Loader set the scene by presenting an overview of the manufacturer\u2019s capabilities which encompass high pressure plastic pipe systems serving all sectors, from water treatment and marine installations to cooling and microelectronics and the chemical process industry. In particular, he profiled the potential of Instaflex whose pipe and fittings extend from 16mm diameter up to 225mm, with an operating temperature range from -100 to +950 centigrade. \nCarrying the BS Kitemark and fully WRAS approved, Instaflex can cope with pressures up to PM 25 and offers fail-safe joint welding techniques for straightforward and trouble free assembly under site conditions. \nMr Loader also explained the attributes of Aquasystem which is offered in 20-125mm diameters and similar pressure limits to Instaflex, while facilitating the provision of potable water supplies. \nProduct manager Sean Green discussed the growing importance of Heat Interface Units - or HIUs - in diverse situations, including the delivery of heating and domestic hot water within apartment buildings or commercial properties. Not only is the Government backing the greater use of heat networks to help reduce energy use across the built environment, but they also offer considerable advantages for both end users and property owners. \nWhen correctly sized and specified they can deliver more affordable warmth from centralised boiler plants, or low carbon sources such as heat pumps, CHP plants or even waste heat. Typically, such communal systems also offer reduced maintenance requirements, with no gas safety checks required within individual dwellings, while heat metering facilitates accurate billing. \nDespite their potential, the history of heat networks and HIUs has been blighted by past problems \u2013 often resulting from poorly insulated or leaking distribution mains and lack of control for end users \u2013 so choosing the right supplier is critical. \nTo deliver the best performance, the HIU must help optimise system temperatures in line with the CIBSE guidance document on heat networks, published in 2015, and be sized to match both the specifier and the system\u2019s requirements. Factors to be considered include primary supply and return temperatures, supply pressure, the size of the network (number of units) and the design output. GF\u2019s range of advanced HIUs are capable of accommodating all of these criteria within a successful heat network. \nOverall, whatever the scale of a project in terms of storey height or square footage, GF Piping Systems can offer clients\u2019 project teams the required solution for heating, cooling, process or potable supply \u2013 encompassing technical support from the design and pre-contract stage through installation, commissioning and future maintenance. \ue878 7 December 2017 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark loader", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loader", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gf piping systems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instaflex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "building centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aquasystem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south west", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:33.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb874d15df425468bf68e446b3ae7d1915478b50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlkNBx_DtAun0EEpnJRi4Fa", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/int/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/int/ - International - 4chan", "title": "What is our relationship like?", "title_full": "/int/ - What is our relationship like? - International - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T09:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1a34aa7852a3fd524f846903e925aa76b3f36d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p7RDiUsCiiZlkNBx_DtAun0A5xIdOJeNvtGHR5qx8cuk-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T09:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "there isn't one", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:57:33.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72b549f5dc9c9609994964bf1434c4ab92073897", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpG3.xCUK3zsUnyDEDllYtt_Ke_pmI_.AJXufEf2eyx.IOVTHi.TQbpIKXJbtwc5bdQnkZHoT1YUx6vRIoavH5ROdNQaTpeIU2mr1UYEsz_MSo0Wo8Vddod", "site_full": "sliding-doors-picture.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://sliding-doors-picture.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "sliding doors", "title": "Sliding Doors 1998 English Subtitles", "title_full": "Sliding Doors 1998 English Subtitles", "published": "2017-12-07T11:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/E-HDqXY_TwxlYMwcpwANaN7I3OmJN6kjCKXWPY7tPJAowVM4EOhKE31JNiNo7Yze_3VpCnnqgsZm2ob86CHTajSXSBJdbRhn6pmrc3rO9ZA7ltxV3U-qSlZ1Vk5G5QNcX9fECyN9x7NCCCKhdKb_2RY-QDDqbcuQQeMD1k-4BF8=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "72b549f5dc9c9609994964bf1434c4ab92073897", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpG3.xCUK3zsUnyDEDllYtt_Ke_pmI_.AJXufEf2eyx.IOVTHi.TQbpIKXJbtwc5bdQnkZHoT1YUx6vRIoavH5ROdNQaTpeIU2mr1UYEsz_MSo0Wo8Vddod", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rafael Firaeal (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sliding Doors 1998 English Subtitles", "text": "Thursday, 7 December 2017 Sliding Doors 1998 English Subtitles The gate is that the exit or entry into a closed area surrounded by a fence or wall.
