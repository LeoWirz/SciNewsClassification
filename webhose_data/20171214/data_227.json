So when this was announced, and then beautiful worlds appeared in the first trailer, anticipation was high.\n\nAnd there is all that inventiveness and attempt at fun that made The Fifth Element such a blast. But the leads in the film, a very talented actor in Dane DeHaan ( Kill Your Darlings ), and kind of new starlet Cara Delevingne ( Suicide Squad ) are not Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich. DeHaan has made his career on playing troubled young men, so the leap from that to action star in a rollicking space adventure is probably not the smoothest move. And Delevingne is still fairly new to acting, and really hasn't made the full transition from successful model to an actress that can carry a film.\n\n\nIn Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets , they play the titular Valerian and Laureline, agents that are trying to keep the peace across space. At the beginning, a peaceful planet is destroyed by neighboring warfare, and that hostility threatens Alpha, a city where creatures from a thousand different planets call home.\n\nFollowing just what is happening in Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets can be a bit much at times, but it really doesn't matter. This is about the worlds Besson has built, and they are magical. I felt how many people felt about Avatar , a film I never really connected with or understood the praise. Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets isn't an amazing film by any means, but it does create a sense of wonder.\n\nAnd then DeHaan and Delevingne zap all of that out of every scene. DeHaan has always been good at playing characters that you want to keep at a distance because they could be combustible. But that is not good for an action star who should be magnetic.

Thousands of reposts were received on weibo just one day. The song is sung by a girl named Yuyao Gao, who is only 12 years old. She is a talented child star since childhood, and she has lots of perform experiences on CCTV, local TV and other important events. There are countless art awards she has got. Apart from a great singer, she also has the talent on acting. She got a role in the TV Situation Sitcom \u201cfamily with children\u201d, and also directed and acted in many children\u2019s micro-films by herself. \n(YuYao Gao) \nToday, Yuyao Gao has been influenced by the hip-hop, and learning rap with the China hip-hop leader group \u2013 XinJieKou Band.It\u2019s amazing that under the guidance of her teacher she finished the whole song independently as the generation after 00\u2019s. \n(Xinjiekou) Her performance means that the first post-00 rapper enters the Chinese music industry and is now the youngest female rapper to officially release her single rap song. More and more children are fond of hip-hop with the support of their parents. In the past the choices were folk music and main stream music. \n(Group) \nThe new era is quite unexpected. \nWe are expecting hip-hop will be flourishing in China and perhaps make a bigger surprise for the world. \nMedia Contact Company Name: FINANCE NEWS CO., LTD.

You can find that post here ! With fall coming to an end, we wanted to recap our bucket list and share with you what we checked off. Below you will find our original fall bucket list. Items in bold are what we completed! 1. Decorate for fall 2. Go to a pumpkin patch 3. Stock up on fall foods at Trader Joe\u2019s We definitely did and tried some new items as well! Check out our favorites in our blog post here ! 4. Watch Casper, Halloweentown & Hocus Pocus 5. Go to an apple orchard 6. Eat a caramel apple We wish we would have eaten more! 7. Go on a hike to look at all the fall colors 8. Do some fall baking Michelle found a new cookie recipe that she loves! 9. Buy all the fall Bath & Body Works candles 10. Go on a hayride Technically it was a wagon ride-does that count? 11. Break out our fall clothes 12. Drink apple cider 13. Visit a corn maze 14. Try a new pumpkin recipe 15. Watch a new fall show-any suggestions? Rachel has started to watch The Good Doctor and loves it! We also tried watching The Seal team, but couldn\u2019t get into it. 16. Have a fall photo shoot 17. Eat yummy food and spend time with our family on Thanksgiving This is one of our absolute favorite things about fall! we had such a good, relaxing Thanksgiving this year! 18. Go Black Friday shopping (online) We bought a few things for ourselves, but also bought a lot of Christmas gifts. \n\nOverall, we did really well with our fall bucket list this year! We completed 17/18 items, so we only missed one item. Unfortunately, it was baking a new pumpkin recipe, which should have been easy! Hopefully next year, we\u2019ll bake a new pumpkin recipe though. We have had such a fun fall checking things off of our checklist. Maybe we should make a winter bucket list now. We\u2019ll have to start thinking. \nLet us know how you did on your fall bucket list in the comments below! \n-Michelle & Rachel", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michelle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "halloweentown & hocus pocus", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:06.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f64a95f0c462f75f7d61bd519ee9851198361a13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UfSfLStoeMsA_47E.oKM9D4MsVddjFCjHX7V0WNQDRx9E6Z77YH3Ny4TcFmoXX6HraTIZgiiCMD6lLiZqWclcWII4gOvOjME_qku6gTRn1uqi9_JqndWm4L", "site_full": "dating-millionaire.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://dating-millionaire.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "International Dating Online", "title": "Avisering fr\u00e5n Google \u2013 one night stand", "title_full": "Avisering fr\u00e5n Google \u2013 one night stand", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f64a95f0c462f75f7d61bd519ee9851198361a13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UfSfLStoeMsA_47E.oKM9D4MsVddjFCjHX7V0WNQDRx9E6Z77YH3Ny4TcFmoXX6HraTIZgiiCMD6lLiZqWclcWII4gOvOjME_qku6gTRn1uqi9_JqndWm4L", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dating Akuten (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "Avisering fr\u00e5n Google \u2013 one night stand", "text": "one night stand Direktuppdatering \u22c5 7 december 2017 WEBB What would work to convince someone for a onenightstand ?

Following the introduction of trucks for long-haulage and construction, the focus is now on urban and additional low-carbon transport solutions.\n\"With today's release, Scania comprehensively sets the stage for the necessary shift towards sustainable transport, offering tailored low-carbon trucks for all transport applications,\" says Christian Levin , Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing.\nThe new fuel-efficient future-oriented trucks all feature the widely acclaimed styling and product characteristics of the new truck generation. Among these are enhanced driveability as well as improved visibility, increased safety, ergonomics and comfort. With the new generation trucks, Scania is taking major steps in providing customer-adapted trucks for even better total operating economy.\nScania extends its urban range\nWith the introduction of the lighter trucks powered by the new 7-litre engine, Scania offers urban transporters a new level of transport efficiency with fuel savings of up to 10 percent. With its more compact dimensions, the new P-series cab can feature a lower engine tunnel, which opens up a more spacious cab interior. Drivers will enjoy the best driving conditions in the industry in vehicles that excel in handling, steering and driveability \u2013 all of which are essential in challenging urban traffic.\nLow entry for higher efficiency\nThe L-series is Scania's newly developed cab series for urban transport, such as distribution, refuse collection and maintenance. Drivers will benefit from vastly improved direct vision of the surroundings. Drivers will also be at the same height as other road users, with the added advantage of improved working conditions when repeatedly entering and exiting the cab. The Scania L-series features a kneeling mode and lower boarding steps on both sides of the cab. Drivers can also take advantage of the space in front of the engine tunnel to exit on the passenger side, thereby avoiding oncoming traffic.\nKeeping an eye on safety\nIn addition to the better view over surrounding traffic, Scania introduces the City Safe Window. Drivers will thereby have better opportunities to detect nearby pedestrians and cyclists. The window on the passenger side door is available for all P- and L-series cabs, those most common in urban transport, as well as for the CrewCab.\nScania CrewCab \u2013 protecting those that protect\nSince Scania's new CrewCab will mainly be used by firefighters, it has been specifically tailored for emergency assignments, keeping both ergonomics and safety in mind. For extra safety, there is an option for up to four roll over side-curtain airbags. The CrewCab accommodates up to eight passengers with a high level of safety and comfort, which includes a separate climate system with its own heating for the crew area.\nBreakthrough for gas-fuelled long-haulage operations\nScania already offers the broadest range of trucks for renewable fuels, including ethanol, biodiesel, HVO as well as hybrid technology.\nWith Scania's introduction of a six-cylinder 13-litre gas engine specifically designed for regional and long-haulage operations, climate-conscious hauliers now have a strong alternative to conventional fossil fuels. For a 40-tonne truck-and-trailer combination with tanks for liquefied gas, the range has been extended to 1,100 kilometres. In parallel, Scania also releases a 9-litre gas engine for the new truck generation.\nIncreased uptime with flexible plans\nScania Maintenance with Flexible Plans is now also made available for the gas engine range.Significantly greater maintenance precision can be achieved on the basis of the vehicle's actual usage pattern as continuously monitored through connectivity. The solution ensures that every single truck gets exactly the right maintenance at exactly the right time, thereby reducing time in the workshop and increasing uptime.\n\"With the new generation trucks, Scania is taking major steps in improved safety, driver comfort and fuel economy. The released models have been universally praised and awarded for their innovative features and overall performance and we are certain that the new urban range will be equally successful,\" says Levin.\nMore information available on www.scania.com/group/en/section/pressroom/presskit/ .\nFor further information, please contact:\nHenrik Eng\nProduct Director, Urban, Scania Trucks\nPhone: + 46-70-658-98-29\nemail: henrik.eng@scania.com\n\u00d6rjan \u00c5slund\nHead of Product Affairs, Scania Trucks\nPhone: +46-70-289-83-78\nemail: orjan.aslund@scania.com\nThis information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.com\nhttp://news.cision.com/scania/r/scania-unveils-future-oriented-city-trucks,c2409320\nThe following files are available for download:\nhttp://mb.cision.com/Main/209/2409320/763714.pdf\nN17028EN Scania unveils future-oriented city trucks\nhttp://news.cision.com/scania/i/17289-001,c2298329\n17289-001\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/scania-unveils-future-oriented-city-trucks-300568294.html\nSOURCE Scania\n Merck Receives Approval (Updated Registration) for Mavenclad (Cladribine Tablets) in Australia", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://news.cision.com/", "http://assignmenteditor.com/pr-newswire-3/?rkey=20171207enUK201712074765_Public&filter=1673", "http://mb.cision.com/Main/209/2409320/763714.pdf", "http://www.scania.com/group/en/section/pressroom/presskit/", "http://news.cision.com/scania/r/scania-unveils-future-oriented-city-trucks,c2409320", "http://news.cision.com/scania/i/17289-001,c2298329"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christian levin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henrik eng product director", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "levin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dec scania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hvo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "urban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scania maintenance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scania trucks phone", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:06.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "09e2f8c223738fed459bca9a52b84244d78ed64f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPbFxIWkQ.Y2h_EkJSYv7LGAbmhsFL8wn82hqhOdsEFfgWiSD.czaugBo57oGAFIMiVUWyWwKmfvFGVijqqfuBSe0sqYe6MU0amGSTTGafTqXU0r5B2M_J", "site_full": "moneyish.com", "site": "moneyish.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "needlework"], "section_title": "", "title": "More people are watching the 'Today' show since Matt Lauer was fired", "title_full": "More people are watching the 'Today' show since Matt Lauer was fired", "published": "2017-12-06T10:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.027, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wWESNGCzFgLoCK.kQTNEOA--~B/aD03MDk7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9HvmC2SulkjIsyBdLyyi6Q--/dz0xMDI0O2g9NzA5O3RhZz1vcmlnaW5hbDthcHBpZD15bmV3cw--/http://streambe.zenfs.com/streambe/streambe_f0b9e43f-6286-3ee5-ac79-a5e6b0bbcefd--1643199484.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "09e2f8c223738fed459bca9a52b84244d78ed64f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPbFxIWkQ.Y2h_EkJSYv7LGAbmhsFL8wn82hqhOdsEFfgWiSD.czaugBo57oGAFIMiVUWyWwKmfvFGVijqqfuBSe0sqYe6MU0amGSTTGafTqXU0r5B2M_J", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T10:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "More people are watching the 'Today' show since Matt Lauer was fired", "text": "More people are watching the 'Today' show since Matt Lauer was fired moneyish.com \u2022 More people are watching the 'Today' show since Matt Lauer was fired More \u201cToday\u201d show viewers don't seem to miss Matt Lauer.

When I came into office, I promised to look at the world\u2019s challenges with open eyes and very fresh thinking. We cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past. Old challenges demand new approaches.\nMy announcement today marks the beginning of a new approach to conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.In 1995, Congress adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act, urging the federal government to relocate the American embassy to Jerusalem and to recognize that that city \u2014 and so importantly \u2014 is Israel\u2019s capital. This act passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago.\nYet, for over 20 years, every previous American president has exercised the law\u2019s waiver, refusing to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem or to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital city.\nPresidents issued these waivers under the belief that delaying the recognition of Jerusalem would advance the cause of peace. Some say they lacked courage, but they made their best judgments based on facts as they understood them at the time. Nevertheless, the record is in. After more than two decades of waivers, we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result.\nTherefore, I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\nWhile previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering.\nI've judged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. This is a long-overdue step to advance the peace process and to work towards a lasting agreement.\nIsrael is a sovereign nation with the right like every other sovereign nation to determine its own capital. Acknowledging this as a fact is a necessary condition for achieving peace.\nIt was 70 years ago that the United States, under President Truman, recognized the State of Israel. Ever since then, Israel has made its capital in the city of Jerusalem -- the capital the Jewish people established in ancient times. Today, Jerusalem is the seat of the modern Israeli government. It is the home of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, as well as the Israeli Supreme Court. It is the location of the official residence of the Prime Minister and the President. It is the headquarters of many government ministries.\nFor decades, visiting American presidents, secretaries of state, and military leaders have met their Israeli counterparts in Jerusalem, as I did on my trip to Israel earlier this year.\nJerusalem is not just the heart of three great religions, but it is now also the heart of one of the most successful democracies in the world. Over the past seven decades, the Israeli people have built a country where Jews, Muslims, and Christians, and people of all faiths are free to live and worship according to their conscience and according to their beliefs.\nJerusalem is today, and must remain, a place where Jews pray at the Western Wall, where Christians walk the Stations of the Cross, and where Muslims worship at Al-Aqsa Mosque.\nHowever, through all of these years, presidents representing the United States have declined to officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. In fact, we have declined to acknowledge any Israeli capital at all.\nBut today, we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel\u2019s capital. This is nothing more, or less, than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It's something that has to be done.\nThat is why, consistent with the Jerusalem Embassy Act, I am also directing the State Department to begin preparation to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This will immediately begin the process of hiring architects, engineers, and planners, so that a new embassy, when completed, will be a magnificent tribute to peace.\nIn making these announcements, I also want to make one point very clear: This decision is not intended, in any way, to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement. We want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians. We are not taking a position of any final status issues, including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, or the resolution of contested borders. Those questions are up to the parties involved.\nThe United States remains deeply committed to helping facilitate a peace agreement that is acceptable to both sides. I intend to do everything in my power to help forge such an agreement. Without question, Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive issues in those talks. The United States would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides.\nIn the meantime, I call on all parties to maintain the status quo at Jerusalem's holy sites, including the Temple Mount, also known as Haram al-Sharif.\nAbove all, our greatest hope is for peace, the universal yearning in every human soul. With today\u2019s action, I reaffirm my administration\u2019s longstanding commitment to a future of peace and security for the region.\nThere will, of course, be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement. But we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a peace aa place far greater in understanding and cooperation.\nThis sacred city should call forth the best in humanity, lifting our sights to what it is possible; not pulling us back and down to the old fights that have become so totally predictable. Peace is never beyond the grasp of those willing to reach.\nSo today, we call for calm, for moderation, and for the voices of tolerance to prevail over the purveyors of hate. Our children should inherit our love, not our conflicts.\nI repeat the message I delivered at the historic and extraordinary summit in Saudi Arabia earlier this year: The Middle East is a region rich with culture, spirit, and history. Its people are brilliant, proud, and diverse, vibrant and strong. But the incredible future awaiting this region is held at bay by bloodshed, ignorance, and terror.\nVice President Pence will travel to the region in the coming days to reaffirm our commitment to work with partners throughout the Middle East to defeat radicalism that threatens the hopes and dreams of future generations.\nIt is time for the many who desire peace to expel the extremists from their midst. It is time for all civilized nations, and people, to respond to disagreement with reasoned debate \u2013- not violence.\nAnd it is time for young and moderate voices all across the Middle East to claim for themselves a bright and beautiful future.\nSo today, let us rededicate ourselves to a path of mutual understanding and respect. Let us rethink old assumptions and open our hearts and minds to possible and possibilities. And finally, I ask the leaders of the region -- political and religious; Israeli and Palestinian; Jewish and Christian and Muslim -- to join us in the noble quest for lasting peace.\nThank you.

It is noisy but i wouldn't say it is significantly noisier than my Samsung. Passengers was more than acceptable, Valerian was slightly noisier but again more than acceptable. Lala land was very loud during parts of the intro but so is my Samsung the main difference i found was that on the Sammy once i started the lala land movie it was quiet straight away but with the LG chapters 1 and 2 were quite loud but as soon as it skipped to chapter 3 the noise wend down considerable. So on the whole a bit louder than my Samsung in places but not significantly. I did however think the picture was better with the LG i don't know if it was placebo or not. I have still to sit down and watch a full movie so time will tell if it has any issues with freezing or not.\nOn a side not if the player is prone to freezing surely this isn't something LG can just say is acceptable they cant expect people to start ejecting the disks after an hour or so to see the film through. Is this something which could be dealt with via a firmware update ?? Click to expand... I have an April build and mine is like you say, nothing too concerning.\nI'm in contact with LG about the freezing issues, but I'd recommend others do the same so it's fixed quicker.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:07.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6216b012d91f7dfef25a8bc44276e9d8d3ec3c6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCq2.8CQgP_dMRUu3LaLr2hiK0KofVK0oQ_SEi8aKg5lfQrY6E7VXBhOyJfotgjUr1WRQLXEPI48f4MMqHcDKqHgDOzka5gTgXl2Gv6CRlGGscFNy56VvOiD", "site_full": "blogdoraulvalois.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://blogdoraulvalois.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Raul Valois - Not\u0102cias Policiais 24 horas!", "title": "PAIS DE ESTUDANTES DA CIDADE DE GRAVAT\u0102\u0081 PROCURAM JUSTI\u0102\u2021A PARA SEUS FILHOS", "title_full": "PAIS DE ESTUDANTES DA CIDADE DE GRAVAT\u0102\u0081 PROCURAM JUSTI\u0102\u2021A PARA SEUS FILHOS", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "BR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6216b012d91f7dfef25a8bc44276e9d8d3ec3c6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCq2.8CQgP_dMRUu3LaLr2hiK0KofVK0oQ_SEi8aKg5lfQrY6E7VXBhOyJfotgjUr1WRQLXEPI48f4MMqHcDKqHgDOzka5gTgXl2Gv6CRlGGscFNy56VvOiD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Raul Valois (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "PAIS DE ESTUDANTES DA CIDADE DE GRAVAT\u0102\u0081 PROCURAM JUSTI\u0102\u2021A PARA SEUS FILHOS", "text": "V\u0102\u008dDEOS DE V\u0102\u0081RIOS PAIS DA CIDADE DE GRAVAT\u0102\u0081 E CICLO VIZINHAS NO MINIST\u0102\u2030RIO P\u0102\u0161BLICO DA CIDADE DE CARUARU JUNTOS COM A TV JORNAL SBT LUTANDO PELOS DIREITOS DE MAIS DE MIL ESTUDANTES QUE PERDERAM A PROVA DA UNIVERSIDADE DE PERNAMBUCO UPE NO \u0102\u0161LTIMO DOMINGO DIA ,03 DE DEZEMBRO POR CAUSA DE UM PROTESTO NA BR 232 PERTO DO DISTRITO DE ENCRUZILHADA DE S\u0102\u0192O JO\u0102\u0192O NA CIDADE DOS BEZERROS EM PERNAMBUCO QUE COME\u0102\u2021OU PIR VOLTA DAS 5 HORAS DA MANH\u0102\u0192 E TERMINOU POR VOLTA DAS 8:30 DA MANH\u0102\u0192\n\nOS ALUNOS NAO TEM CULPA SE AS POL\u0102\u008dCIAS PRF E MILITAR QUE FORAM CHAMADAS  PASSARAM 3 HORAS PARA APARECER.\n\n\n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "horas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "horas para aparecer", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "caruaru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pernambuco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:07.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e1a0b9169f3d0533f66beff733234ec13ea89828", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScqJxGpeUZ0zn.IcpZp2Z3tF_4ZjzJLbJzN0uKgbvL4qLDrcfhYCcI40fK0U5KfQRnMuIK8KwNCoxSKhxtBQ5ADiCiT5UVJc2VaJ.Rhaexl5y8Q1l9DTcX.mdw2Q06jvY-", "site_full": "www.politico.com", "site": "politico.com", "site_section": "https://www.politico.com/rss/politicopicks.xml", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "POLITICO - TOP Stories", "title": "John Conyers Was An Icon.

It is noisy but i wouldn't say it is significantly noisier than my Samsung. Passengers was more than acceptable, Valerian was slightly noisier but again more than acceptable. Lala land was very loud during parts of the intro but so is my Samsung the main difference i found was that on the Sammy once i started the lala land movie it was quiet straight away but with the LG chapters 1 and 2 were quite loud but as soon as it skipped to chapter 3 the noise wend down considerable. So on the whole a bit louder than my Samsung in places but not significantly. I did however think the picture was better with the LG i don't know if it was placebo or not. I have still to sit down and watch a full movie so time will tell if it has any issues with freezing or not.\nOn a side not if the player is prone to freezing surely this isn't something LG can just say is acceptable they cant expect people to start ejecting the disks after an hour or so to see the film through.

Assembly was a piece of cake, camera was already mounted. I downloaded the camera app ( MJX H ) to my android phone, works perfect. I crashed it really bad in our cedar hedge(about 20 feet high) when learning how to fly it. (The LEDs help a lot in trying to find it's location) It was stuck in there, so I just kept trying to maneuver it out, and I eventually got it out. ZERO damage!! This thing is really tough, takes a crash and keeps going. I am getting better at piloting this thing now. It is a ton of fun and surprisingly well made for a lower cost drone. Go easy on the throttle as this drone can climb very quickly. Wish the battery had a longer flight time. I ordered the six pack of batteries for it from Amazon also.

Think pastel seafoam green and sunny yellow, bright cherry and sweet peach, shades that are both gorgeous yet utterly wearable. \nThe Chanel Neapolis collection will be available from 28 th December 2017. #1: Les 9 Ombres Palette Edition No1 in Affresco, $139 \n\u201cAll the elements of Naples are in here,\u201d says Lucia Pica of this palette, the most generous Chanel eyeshadow compact to date. The palette is a play on texture as well as colour: there are three matte, three satin and three high-shine shades, all soft and extremely blendable. The universally flattering shades range from brighter to more muted tones, reflecting Naples and its myriad influences: ancient and modern, sacred and sensual, historical and alive. A bright green sits alongside a faded grey-green. A luminous peachy beige is tempered by a subtle mink brown. A bright gold sings out beside a dark rusty-red brown. Each colour can be traced back to a visionary moment on Lucia Pica\u2019s Neapolitan journey, from volcanic rocks to the sea at nightfall. #2: (L to R) Rouge Allure Ink in #164 Entusiasta and #166 Etera, $50 each \nFor something more vivid and bold, try Entusiasta \u2013 a matte orange. If you prefer a sweeter look, go for the peach pink Eterea. #3: (L to R) Rouge Coco Gloss in #792 Aphrodite, #794 Poppea, #786 Sibylla and #788 Parthenope, $48 each \nWe are loving the glisteningly ethereal shades of the weightless Rouge Coco Gloss. Our favourites include the limited edition Parthenope, a nude peachy caramel, and Aphrodite, a watery baby blue that can be worn alone or layered over a brighter lip colour. #4: (L to R) Le Vernis in # 588 Nuvola Rosa, #590 Verde Pastello, #592 Giallo Napoli and #634 Arancio Vibrante, $39 each \nNails are the best way to play with colour. With this collection, Lucia Pica has created her first pastel polishes, including Nuvola Rosa, a pastel pink cloud and Verde Pastello, a delicate mint green. For women who prefer something stronger, there\u2019s also bright orange with Arancio Vibrante. Giallo Napoli\u2019s \u2018bright Naples yellow\u2019 refers to the famous shade used in paints. #5: (L to R) Poudre A Levres in #410 Rosso Pompeiano, #418 Rosa Tempera and #415 Rosso Parthenope, $53 each \nThese entirely new and artisanal lip pigments take a cue from the colours and tempera technique of Pompeiian frescoes. A powder is mixed by the wearer with a balm, generating a blurred, painterly effect \u2013 with as much or as little intensity of colour as desired. #6: Ombre Premiere Creme in #824 Verderame, $53 \nFor a more intense eye, try this exceptional dusty grey-green cream eye shadow with a subtle metallic sheen, which looks beautiful worn alone or layered beneath the shadows in the eye palette. #7: Joues Contraste in #430 Foschia Rosa, $72 \nInspired by the view of the mountains view at sunset, this limited edition blush in Foschia Rosa is a poetic dusting of pink that will instantly brighten the complexion.

This promotion is one of the most generous and ambitious the company has ever undertaken, and the expectation is that demand will be huge. \nThe process has been designed to be quick and easy; the form only asks for five key pieces of information, first name, last name, email address, phone number, and postcode. Once completed the site visitor then receives their voucher via return email. They simply take the voucher to their local Carpet One Australia Store and can redeem it against any purchase over $750.00 including sale items. \n\u201cWe are always looking for innovative promotions and ideas that truly benefit our customers,\u201d said David Meyer of Carpet One Australia. \u201cRather than offer a promotion on specific floor coverings or other merchandise available in store, we decided to offer a voucher that allowed all of our customers to benefit regardless of the products they chose to purchase. We believe that this could be our most successful promotion ever, in fact, the biggest problem customers could face is choosing which product best suits their home. We have even thought of that though and have created our exclusive flooring comparison tool to give our customers some guidance in the peace and quiet of their own homes. Be warned though this promotion must end by the 31 st January.\u201d \nCarpet One is a co-operative and one of the world\u2019s largest retail floor covering groups. This means that they have huge buying power. The subsequent savings made as a result are then passed onto customers offering unbeatable value all year round. All of their stores offer a large range of carpet, timber, vinyl, and laminate. Each individual store has the flexibility to provide additional products and services \u2014 like carpet cleaning, tiles, furniture, rugs and window fashions. \nFor more information about the company visit their website at https://www.carpetone.com.au", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david meyer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "carpet one australia store", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queensland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:09.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10bf5b013ad58ec41cd0a1050640bb38ffccb8e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9q.auYpKpv6gIo_ZTRTIhnxA_lOEEBEeDn9F35kMaRzo2E6WOoy4dW8GAvejxIybc3ou2y6NFvaVD62Z4F2uOyLcRMkjaIHzCEB856Tx0fkeFWkWg18nWNsav0swYZKu4VSiYQOK9VRFj8r4zNkt4A", "site_full": "www.fanforum.com", "site": "fanforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.fanforum.com/f456/", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Colin O'Donoghue - Fan Forum", "title": "Creations [ Fan Art ] #5: Come with me, and you'll see, a world full of imagination. - Page 5", "title_full": "Colin O'Donoghue - Creations [ Fan Art ] #5: Come with me, and you'll see, a world full of imagination. - Page 5 - Fan Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T15:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 92524, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10bf5b013ad58ec41cd0a1050640bb38ffccb8e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9q.auYpKpv6gIo_ZTRTIhnxA_lOEEBEeDn9F35kMaRzo2E6WOoy4dW8GAvejxIybc3ou2y6NFvaVD62Z4F2uOyLcRMkjaIHzCEB856Tx0fkeFWkWg18nWNsav0swYZKu4VSiYQOK9VRFj8r4zNkt4A", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "LilMouse", "published": "2017-12-06T15:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Creations [ Fan Art ] #5: Come with me, and you'll see, a world full of imagination. - Page 5", "text": "OMG...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:28:09.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10bf5b013ad58ec41cd0a1050640bb38ffccb8e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9q.auYpKpv6gIo_ZTRTIhnxA_lOEEBEeDn9F35kMaRzo2E6WOoy4dW8GAvejxIybc3ou2y6NFvaVD62Z4F2uOyLcRMkjaIHzCEB856Tx0fkeFWkWg18nWNsav0swYZKu4VSiYQOK9VRFj8r4zNkt4A", "site_full": "www.fanforum.com", "site": "fanforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.fanforum.com/f456/", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Colin O'Donoghue - Fan Forum", "title": "Creations [ Fan Art ] #5: Come with me, and you'll see, a world full of imagination. - Page 5", "title_full": "Colin O'Donoghue - Creations [ Fan Art ] #5: Come with me, and you'll see, a world full of imagination. - Page 5 - Fan Forum", "published": "2017-12-06T15:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 92524, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b1ef03558847d76cc1762c608a8ad6e38961bd6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9q.auYpKpv6gIo_ZTRTIhnxA_lOEEBEeDn9F35kMaRzo2E6WOoy4dW8GAvejxIybc3ou2y6NFvaVD62Z4F2uOyLcRMkjaIHzCEB856Tx0fkeFWkWg18nWNsav0swYZKu4VSiYQOK9VRJ8dRZwgQ.ITNMzOYmV7NPvlMP4.rGLriA--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Meliana", "published": "2017-12-07T10:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "^I hate when that happens!

We are committed to completing \u20ac300 million in share buybacks by year-end 2017.\nCurrent repurchases are being executed under a third party mandate granted on September 26, 2017. Under this mandate, we intend to implement share buybacks of up to \u20ac50 million in the period from November 2, 2017 up until December 31, 2017, and a further up to \u20ac50 million in the period from January 1, 2018 up to and including February 19, 2018.\nShare repurchases are made within the limits of relevant laws and regulations, in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer's Articles of Association.

Shakhtar then capitalised on uncertainty in the City defence with Bernard firing the home side ahead before 'keeper Ederson gifted the hosts a second - Ismaily taking advantage to tighten the Ukrainian champions' grip on a last-16 spot before Sergio Aguero scored a late penalty for the visitors. The result spoiled Guardiola's milestone 100th appearance as manager in the competition, but he was determined to focus on the positives that he and his players will take from the experience. \"It hurts. It is never nice to lose a game,\" he said. \"But we have said many times we cannot win all the time, we are going to lose games. Today was the first. \"We needed to lose a game. It will be good for the club, for all of us and the media. People say things when you win a lot and you can forget that now. \"We saw many good things but we made mistakes and we are going to improve on that. Football is how you recover in the good moments and bad moments to stay stable.\" Guardiola was thrilled with the performance of some of his younger second-string players. \"I'm so pleased for Tosin (Adarabioyo), Phil (Foden) and Brahim (Diaz) and how well they played,\" he said. \"We came here to win. We couldn't but we were trying until the end to do so. I'm happy for the performance. \"Now we are going to rest, come back tomorrow and prepare for the game (against Manchester United).\" However, the Spaniard refused to be drawn into billing City as Champions League favourites heading into Monday's last-16 draw in Switzerland. \"It always happens when the draw is made they talk about it but it depends how the team arrives at that moment, on that day. \"Maybe you are good today but in February, you're a disaster. Or the opposite. It will be tough.

Time In this Monday, April 7, 2014, file photo, a bitcoin logo is displayed at the Inside Bitcoins conference and trade show in New York. The bitcoin miner NiceHash says it is investigating a security breach and the theft of the contents of the NiceHash \"bitcoin wallet.\" (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP) CONNECT 9 COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOKYO \u2013 A bitcoin mining company in Slovenia has been hacked, for the possible theft of tens of millions of dollars, renewing questions about the security of the virtual currency just days before it is due to start trading on major U.S. exchanges. NiceHash, a company that mines bitcoins on behalf of customers, said Thursday it is investigating a security breach and will stop operating for 24 hours while it verifies how many bitcoins were taken. Research company Coindesk said that a wallet address referred to by NiceHash users indicates that about 4,700 bitcoins had been stolen. At Thursday\u2019s record price of about $14,000, that puts the value at almost $66 million. There was no immediate response from NiceHash to an emailed request for more details. \u201cThe incident has been reported to the relevant authorities and law enforcement and we are cooperating with them as a matter of urgency,\u201d it said. The statement urged users to change their online passwords. The hack will put a spotlight on the security of bitcoin just as the trading community prepares for the currency to start trading on two established U.S. exchanges. Futures for bitcoin will start trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange on Sunday evening and on crosstown rival CME Group\u2019s platforms later in the month. That has increased the sense among some investors that bitcoin is gaining in mainstream legitimacy after several countries, like China, tried to stifle the virtual currency. As a result, the price of bitcoin has jumped in the past year, particularly so in recent weeks. On Thursday it surged to over $14,100.74, up $1,000 in less than a day, according to Coindesk. At the start of the year, one bitcoin was worth less than $1,000. Bitcoin is the world\u2019s most popular virtual currency. Such currencies are not tied to a bank or government and allow users to spend money anonymously. They are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they are traded. More: Federal regulator gives OK for bitcoin futures to trade A debate is raging on the merits of such currencies. Some say they serve merely to facilitate money laundering and illicit, anonymous payments. Others say they can be helpful methods of payment, such as in crisis situations where national currencies have collapsed. Miners of bitcoins and other virtual currencies help keep the systems honest by having their computers keep a global running tally of transactions. That prevents cheaters from spending the same digital coin twice. Online security is a vital concern for such dealings. In Japan, following the failure of a bitcoin exchange called Mt.
