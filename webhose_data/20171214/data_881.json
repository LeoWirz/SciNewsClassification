It is the first time in the history of the Champions League that a country has had five teams in the last-16 stage of the competition. \nManchester City went through as Group F winners despite their 2-1 defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk , while Tottenham are also through in first place having wrapped up their group campaign with a 3-0 win over APOEL Nicosia . Manchester United and Liverpool qualified as group winners too, with Jurgen Klopp's side clinching top spot in Group E with their emphatic 7-0 thrashing of Spartak Moscow on Wednesday. Chelsea had to settle for second place in Group C following their 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night. \n\nThis season marked the first Champions League campaign in which there were five Premier League clubs competing in the group stage after United qualified following their Europa League victory over Ajax, despite finishing sixth in the Premier League.

The bathroom is pretty small with a walk in shower that was updated. The hotel has no direct parking garage so you can either pay for parking in the public parking or do the $30 a day valet. When we first walked in we were only greeted by the valet parking gentleman out front. There was a nice lady who checked us in and another lady who had some sort of manager title on her badge that didn't even acknowledge us. We signed our documents and headed out. The AC in the room was loud the whole time but we were able to crack the windows and get some fresh air which was nice. The next day when we were checking out I noticed that our bill was higher than what I agreed when I reserved the hotel room so I brought it to the same young ladies attention that checked us in. When she asked me if I had my reservation email I showed it to her. Now beside her was a gentleman with a front office manager title who then decided to speak up, after also not even acknowledging us, to ask which room we were in. To which we responded and he pulled our document that we signed when checking in which had the higher price. To which he pointed out and rudely let us know that we should be more observant of what we sign and then told the young lady to go ahead and adjust the difference. Now I know he is right and it was my fault, but he didn't say it to be polite.

The Palestinians seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as a future capital.\nLATEST SFGATE VIDEOS Now Playing: Now Playing Behind the scenes: \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" sfgate Star Wars: The Last Jedi (official trailer) sfgate Muni bus and streetcar collide sfgate Time lapse of Bay Area traffic sfgate Mountain lion and kitten spotted for first time since fire sfgate Santa Rosa firefighters headed south to fight LA blaze sfgate The best views in Russian Hill sfgate Ventura resident shows view of massive fire sfgate Oakland city workers go on strike sfgate Smoke from Creek Fire smothers Lake View Terrace in Los Angeles sfgate There have been no signs of serious violence so far. But Friday, the Muslim holy day, could provide an important test when Palestinians gather for weekly mass prayers.\nIn the Gaza Strip, Hamas' leader Ismail Haniyeh called on Palestinians to launch a new intifada, or uprising, against Israel on Friday.\n\"The American decision is an aggression on our people and a war on our sanctuaries,\" Haniyeh said in a speech, urging supporters \"to be ready for any orders.\"\n\"We want the uprising to last and continue to let Trump and the occupation regret this decision,\" he said.\nHamas, a group that seeks Israel's destruction, killed hundreds of Israelis in suicide bombings and other attacks in the early 2000s. But the group's capabilities are more limited now. Gaza, Hamas' stronghold, is closed by an Israeli blockade, while in the West Bank, many of its members have been arrested. Nonetheless, it possesses a large arsenal of rockets capable of striking much of Israel.\nSpontaneous protests sparked in Gaza overnight, with angry youths burning tires, American and Israeli flags and Trump posters.\nThe Israeli military said it would deploy several battalions to the West Bank ahead of Friday, while other troops have been put on alert to address \"possible developments.\"\nThe conflicting claims to Jerusalem, and especially its Old City, where sensitive Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites are located, lie at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While Trump's decision had no impact on the city's daily life, it carried deep symbolic meaning, and was seen as siding with Israel and an attempt to impose a solution on the Palestinians.\nIsrael, which claims all of Jerusalem as its undivided capital, has welcomed Trump's decision. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Trump \"bound himself forever\" to the history of Jerusalem with the move and claimed other states are considering following suit.\n\"We are already in contact with other states that will make a similar recognition,\" he said at the Foreign Ministry on Thursday.\nAnger at the U.S. has rippled across the Arab world.\nSaudi Arabia's royal court, led by King Salman and his powerful son, condemned the Trump administration's decision in a rare public rebuke by the U.S. ally. The regional powerhouse, which could help the White House push through a Middle East settlement, said Thursday the kingdom had already warned against this step and \"continues to express its deep regret at the U.S. administration's decision,\" describing it \"unjustified and irresponsible.\"\nTrump's move puts the Sunni nation in a bind. The kingdom, particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammad Bin Salman, enjoys close relations with Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who leads Trump's efforts to restart Mideast peace talks.\nU.S. Embassies across much of the Middle East and parts of Africa warned American citizens of possible protests following Trump's move.\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has suggested that with Trump's move, the United States disqualified itself as mediator between Israelis and Palestinians, a role it has played exclusively in more than two decades of stop-and-go negotiations aimed at setting up a Palestinian state alongside Israel.\nThe talks, stalled in recent years, have failed to bring the Palestinians closer to the state the seek in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. In parallel, Israel has steadily expanded Jewish settlements on war-won lands, even as it said it wants to negotiate a deal.\nTrump's claim Wednesday that he still wants to pursue what he has called the \"ultimate\" Mideast deal was met by mounting skepticism.\n\"With its decision, the U.S. has isolated itself and Israel, and has pushed the area into a dangerous situation and stopped the peace process,\" said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a senior Abbas aid. \"Without a doubt, this decision will not help at all in solving the problems in the area, but rather strengthen the extremists.\"\nAbbas has not said what steps he would take, if any. Later Thursday, he was to meet with his closest Arab ally, Jordan's King Abdullah II, to coordinate positions.\nJordan plays a central role in the mounting controversy and, alongside other U.S. allies in the region, has slammed Trump's decision on Jerusalem.\nThe king is seen as one of Washington's most dependable partners in the battle against Islamic extremism in the region.\nAt the same time, the legitimacy of his Hashemite dynasty is closely linked to its special role in Jerusalem, as religious guardian of a key Muslim shrine in east Jerusalem. Jordan, which has a large population with Palestinian roots, cannot afford to be seen as soft on Muslim claims to the holy city.\nThe consultations between the monarch and Abbas will kick off a series of meetings in the Arab and Muslim world on how to respond to Trump.\nThe Arab League, a group representing most states in the Middle East and North Africa, will meet Saturday. Next week, Turkey will host a gathering of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which has 57 Arab and Muslim member states.\nThe region has been bracing for fallout from Trump's seismic policy shift.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday accused Trump of throwing the Mideast into a \"ring of fire\" and said his motives were difficult to fathom. \"It's not possible to understand what you are trying to get out of it, Erdogan said, referring to Trump in a speech to a group of workers at Ankara's airport.\n\"Political leaders exist not to stir things up, but to make peace,\" Erdogan said. \"If Trump says 'I am strong therefore I am right,' he is mistaken.\"\nDefying worldwide warnings, Trump insisted Wednesday that it was time for a new approach, starting with what he said was his decision merely based on reality to recognize Jerusalem as the seat of Israel's government. He also said the U.S. would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, though he set no timetable.\n\"We cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past,\" Trump said, brushing aside the appeals for caution from around the world.\n___\nLaub reported from Amman, Jordan.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday (Dec 7) warned of brewing risks in China's banking system as it found dozens of crucial lenders needed to beef up their defences against possible financial crises.\nThe IMF report comes a day after regulators in Beijing drafted new rules to strengthen bank funding, and follows a number of alerts about a ballooning debt problem in the world's No. 2 economy.\nNear the top of the list in the IMF study on the stability of China's financial system is the need for banks to increase their capital to ward off risks from mounting debt.\nChina has largely relied on debt-fuelled investment and exports to drive its tremendous economic growth, but the Fund said this model has reached its limits.\nPart of the problem lies in high growth targets, the IMF said, which incentivise local governments to extend credit and protect failing companies.\n\"We recommend the authorities to de-emphasise the GDP (growth),\" Ms Ratna Sahay, deputy director of the IMF's Monetary and Capital Markets Department, said during a news conference.\nChina should \"incite local governments to strengthen supervision on risks\", she added.\nAbundant credit allows local governments to hit high growth figures but now each extra dollar of debt is producing diminishing returns.\nThe ballooning debt - estimated at 234 per cent of gross domestic product by the IMF - adds financial risk and may weigh on China's future economic growth.\n\"Credit growth is an important indicator of future financial distress, because lending standards often fall in the rush to make more loans,\" IMF experts warned in a blog post.\nThe Fund's experts carried out stress tests on dozens of banks.\nChina's big four banks had adequate capital but \"large, medium, and city-commercial banks appear vulnerable\", the IMF said.\nIt added that 27 out of the 33 banks tested - accounting for three-quarters of China's banking system assets - were \"undercapitalised relative to at least one of the minimum requirements\".\nWhile the country's banking system meets the requirements of global banking rules known as Basel III, \"current circumstances warrant a targeted increase in capital\", the report said.\n\"This would create a buffer to absorb potential losses that can be expected during the economic transition as credit is tightened and implicit guarantees are removed.\"\nChina's central bank said it disagreed with \"a few descriptions and views\" in the report.\n\"The descriptions of the stress testing did not fully reflect the outcomes of the test,\" the People's Bank of China said on its website.\nThe China Banking Regulatory Commission on Wednesday (Dec 6) released a draft of fresh rules to tackle related issues.\nThe latest regulations call for new indicators to monitor commercial banks' liquidity and set related requirements.\nThey will \"strengthen management of liquidity risk for banks and protect the safety and stability of the banking system\", the commission said.\nIn some cases local banks face pressure to lend to politically important companies, as local governments aim to maintain high employment even if that means cash-bleeding enterprises continue to operate.\nThese loss-making firms, often state-owned, have come to be known as zombie companies, and banks and investors fund many of them as if they will not be allowed to fail.\n\"Implicit guarantees and the government's desire to support growth encourage these firms to invest excessively, raising already-high leverage while weakening performance on profitability and debt service capacity,\" the Fund wrote in a recent report.\nIn October, it warned China's dependence on debt was growing at a \"dangerous pace\" and needed to act to avert a crisis.\nThat came weeks after the Bank for International Settlements - dubbed the bank of central banks - said the banking sector could be facing an imminent blowout, raising worries about its effect on the world economy.\nThe IMF's latest assessment said financial engineering helped banks obscure the potential losses.\n\"Implicit guarantees to SOEs (state-owned enterprises) need to be removed carefully and gradually,\" Ms Sahay said.\n\"It would be wise to have a high-level committee to monitor the risks across all sectors.\"\nTopics: CHINA IMF BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS //str.sg/oZXZ Copy", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ratna sahay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "basel iii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sahay", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "imf", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "east asia beijing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "monetary and capital markets department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china banking regulatory commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "people's bank of china", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:41.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "82b67b71e96bd17111d3217f8ca029c98866270a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj16JfG7tME857oqwGjf4Ey9MLzOotBYKVgEpiA08J8e1iKeu1bnnAkTkH9RMYixv2djRWKawgRHI98w84AeBwG_wK0mZWZ11KhJAEprcYycba07HOTm6nb07Zce.jQ81I3LpLZo5VxDsQ3X0eJqyhizkkR2tqOB3vwnVtqboz.m9", "site_full": "forums.wynncraft.com", "site": "wynncraft.com", "site_section": "https://forums.wynncraft.com/forums/general-suggestions.69/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "General Suggestions | Wynncraft Forums", "title": "World -

Today, from Korean bibimbap to a Japanese donburi, or a Buddha bowl with quinoa topped with cauliflower falafel and ratatouille to wild rice, pumpkin, black beans and avocado, the options are endless. \nWhat contributes to the fame of these one-bowl meals is the fact that they do not get monotonous. One can create them across cuisines, and thus, tremendous variety can be inculcated. \nTalk about convenience \nNot only do they give chefs an opportunity to play with colours, flavours and textures and create a vibrant tableau, but they also save them the bother of presentation and filling up empty space on a plate. Convenience is unarguably the driving force, where one-bowl meals are concerned. \nThe real common denominator of these dishes is that they are packed with flavour, texture, crunch and colour. Add to that the fact that one-bowl meals are usually healthy, as they are a nutritious balance of grains, veggies and protein; they are, therefore, a great way to consume controlled portions and fewer calories. \nChef Paul Kinny, culinary director, Phoenix Mills Ltd, says, \u201cThe one-bowl meal trend in India started in 2016, and now it\u2019s gone ahead to become a stable trend. At Shizusan in Bengaluru, we have an entire section dedicated to one-bowl meals, like the Tonkotsu Ramen, Vietnamese Pho, Burmese Khao Suey etc. What we\u2019ve observed is that our diners are mostly corporates who come for lunch and are hard-pressed for time. The one-bowl meal then seems like the perfect solution. At 212 All Good, we have the Andaman Tuna Poke bowl and will probably experiment with acai bowls soon as well.\u201d \nVaried and versatile \nA big bowl of noodles dunked in a hearty broth that is generously garnished with meats, spring onions and a plethora of toppings, including soft-boiled eggs, and spiked with a dash of chilli oil, at The Fatty Bao, or maybe Taipei\u2019s Aromatic Miso Milk bowl from Shizusan, with their signature broth with udon noodles, tofu, and wakame, are appetising meals; all served in large bowls. \nWhile it is commonly believed that one-bowl meals must generally be from Pan Asian cuisines, Monkey Bar has recently introduced a range of 12 hearty one-bowl meals for the winter in their Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata branches. These are largely inspired by Indian cooking, and have a range of flavours to choose from \u2014 Rajma bowl served with chilli pickle, papad and sirka onions, spicy yoghurt, spinach pakora , tawa aloo and rice; Wild mushroom khichdi bowl with slow-cooked mushrooms in a creamy moong dal khichdi; and the Panch Phoron and kasundi maach bowl, with surmai cooked in kasundi and served with gobindobhog rice. \nChef Manu Chandra, chef partner, Monkey Bar, The Fatty Bao and Toast & Tonic, elaborates, \u201cThe one-bowl meal finds inspiration in Asian cuisine, as the bowl was perfectly suited for dishes like ramen, soups and noodles. However, as more and more cuisines adopted the \u2018bowl meal\u2019 format, it now appears to be a growing trend worldwide. For instance, the ease of eating rajma-chawal in a bowl is comfort for me. One-bowl meals are here to stay, and eating out of a bowl certainly gives you a better chance of getting all the flavours and textures in your mouth with every bite.\u201d \nVegetarian options \nThe best one-bowl meals do not have to contain meat or seafood. A Middle-Eastern Mujadara with brown rice and lentils, or a cauliflower rice tabouli, can be perfect one-bowl meals and wow the vegetarian palate. Foodhall Delhi serves a vegetarian poke bowl with tofu cubes instead of the customary tuna, along with avocado and cucumber, and an Asian dressing. The bowl comes with a topping of pickled ginger, soy and wasabi.\nOne can also opt for quinoa tabbouleh, fresh vegetables, avocado, arugula, creamy edamame hummus, drizzled with chipotle vinaigrette and a hot sauce. \nFor some restaurants, one-bowl meals are also a great shot at responsible dining. \u201cWe have been offering \u2018Meal in a Bowl\u2019, across all ITC hotels for some time now. This initiative underscores our responsible luxury endeavours, that emphasise high-on-taste and low-on-waste composite dining experiences. Our team of chefs is at present working towards incorporating forgotten grains, rice varieties, seasonal and locally grown vegetables, indigenous to the region that the hotel is located in, to highlight the diverse kitchens of India,\u201d says Vijay Nagpal, corporate chef, ITC Hotels.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mujadara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vijay nagpal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bengaluru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manu chandra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul kinny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panch phoron", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "andaman tuna poke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aromatic miso milk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monkey bar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fatty bao and toast & tonic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "itc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phoenix mills ltd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bengaluru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shizusan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taipei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monkey bar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolkata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foodhall delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:42.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a8ef32fdbefeff2ab2f32700ec5d38a29c979b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9UNs_b7vYkcd3KwHZ_cMJgyqR2V6qaf744E4VdvpVmjsz_Az1wDlZ.9RUrkOB0VjfkR6kYatj.Y3ogtiKDGq4S0wvobkfsi_bdg7qHQa8ExA0NncgR9W6IvgewpyuGXxg702z6ZCb25A--", "site_full": "www.essentialbaby.com.au", "site": "essentialbaby.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/forums/index.php?/forum/79-6-12-months/", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "6-12 Months - Essential Baby", "title": "Bubs teeth coming out in the wrong order !?", "title_full": "Bubs teeth coming out in the wrong order !? - 6-12 Months - Essential Baby", "published": "2017-12-06T22:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/forums/public/style_images/master/meta_image.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40097, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d1bcf7c49a528d368bb825c61381337443bcd5b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9UNs_b7vYkcd3KwHZ_cMJgyqR2V6qaf744E4VdvpVmjsz_Az1wDlZ.9RUrkOB0VjfkR6kYatj.Y3ogtiKDGq4S0wvobkfsi_bdg7qHQa8ExA0NncgR9W6IvgewpyuGXxh9TgyyL0jeCls7.lRbt2gf", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Nasty Bunsen", "published": "2017-12-06T23:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "DS's teeth did this - they all came in eventually and look perfectly normal.

Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft's influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. The circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. In his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. \"A horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\" he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. Sechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. Referring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \"disappeared \u2014 what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\" Ulyukaev went to Sechin's office in November last year to discuss Rosneft's affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. In wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher's shop. Ulyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev's actions \"are undermining the authority of the government.\" Ulyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \"those absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised. I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts. When you're doing all right, you shamelessly turn your back on other people's misfortunes.\" Ulyukayev asked for \"people's\" forgiveness and pledged to devote rest of his life to \"defending people's interests.\" The court is expected to deliver the verdict next week.

The beauty of Fruit Spirit is in the well-balanced mental and physical effects where one keeps the other in check. Fruit Spirit Effects \u2013 Image powered by Allbud.com \nFruit Spirit is by no means a timid strain. Far from it, one could actually consider its THC content to be insanely high. However, instead of sending users into a mindless bliss and bring on a psychedelic experience, its Indica side keeps the hybrid from overwhelming users. \nIn the same manner, the physical high that the strain induces can be unforgiving. But this time, it is the Sativa side that keeps it from causing a narcotic like stoney effect or leave one on a couch-lock. \nFruit Spirit is an exceptional strain. Its effects are quite intense and yet never too overwhelming. But that is assuming that people will use it within personal limits. Fragrance \nDue to its Blueberry heritage, Fruit Spirit comes with an outstanding aroma. It has a distinct sweet and fruity blueberry scent that can prove to be irresistible. Flavors \nNot only is the strain a winner when it comes to its odor, it is also among the most delicious with its smooth blueberry flavored smoke. Adverse Reaction \nUsers of Fruit Spirit can expect to experience dry mouth and eyes. Beyond that, it depends on the susceptibility of individual users and how much was used or consumed. Use it a little bit too much and there are other reactions that becomes pronounced. Fruit Spirit Adverse Reaction \u2013 Image powered by Seedfinder.eu \nDizziness is a common occurrence especially with its buzzing cerebral effects. To a lesser degree, some people may also experience a mild headache or feel a little bit paranoid. Medical \nFor medical cannabis users who are suffering from chronic illnesses, life is tough in that they have to endure the constant pains and aches. Fruit Spirit has proven to be exceptional in providing comfort. \nTIP: Looking to buy Fruit Spirit seeds ? Check out this marijuana seed shop \nAlso, the ability of the strain in uplifting the mood and inducing cerebral euphoria is more than enough to help people with depression and anyone undergoing stress. Fruit Spirit Medical \u2013 Image powered by Smokableherbs.com \nOne other thing that it is notable for is in stimulating the appetite . Most users are likely to feel hungry before the effects of Fruit Spirit completely leaves the body. Growing \nFruit Spirit is sturdy and grows more like an Indica plant. It is not likely to reach more than 6 or 7 feet. Growers do have the choice of cultivating it inside the house or out in the open. Flowering Time \nIndoors Indoors, Fruit Spirit can thrive using soil as medium for best flavors or hydroponics for a more explosive growth. Under 600w of light, it should be able to produce 13 to 15 ounces of buds. It has a quick flowering period that starts in as early as seven weeks. \nOutdoors Growers opting to cultivate it in the garden will want to do so in a warm climate. The plant loves plenty of sunshine where it is likely to produce up to 19 ounces of buds per plant. The flowering time falls in the first days of October. \nHave you ever smoked or grown your own Fruit Spirit?

Tossing AMP into the mix, which creates an entirely duplicated experience, is not something your developers will be happy about. \nAnd yet despite the various issues surrounding AMP, this technology has potential use cases that every international brand should pause to consider. \nTo start, AMP offers potential to efficiently serve content as fast as possible. According to Google , AMP reduces the median load time of webpages to .7 seconds, compared with 22 seconds for non-AMP sites. \nAnd you can also have an AMP without a traditional HTML page. Google Webmaster Trends Analyst John Mueller has mentioned that AMP pages can be considered as a primary, canonical webpage. This has major implications for sites serving content to developing counties. \nYes, AMP is a restrictive framework that rigorously enforces its own best practices and forces one into its world of amphtml. However, within the AMP framework is a lot of freedom (and its capabilities have grown significantly over the last year). It has built-in efficiencies and smart content prioritization, and a site leveraging AMP has access to Google\u2019s worldwide CDN: Google AMP Cache. \nAll of this is to say that if your brand serves the global market, and especially developing economies, AMP is worth the thought exercise of assessing its implications on your business and user experience. \nWhat in the world-wide web would inspire one to consider AMP? 1. The internet is not the same worldwide \nAkamai publishes an amazing quarterly report on the State of the Internet, and the numbers are startling \u2014 most of the world operates on 10 Mbps or less, with developing countries operating at less than 5 Mbps, on average. \nIf 10 Mbps doesn\u2019t make your skin crawl, Facebook\u2019s visual of 4G, 3G and 2G networks worldwide from 2016 (below) will. \nThe visuals show a clear picture: Developing countries don\u2019t have the same internet and wireless network infrastructure as developed economies. This means that brands serving developing countries can\u2019t approach them with the same formula. 2. Websites overall are getting chunkier \nWhile all of this is happening, the average size of website is increasing\u2026 and rapidly. According to reports by HTTParchive.org, the average total size of a webpage in 2017 is 475 percent larger than in 2010. \nDespite the number of requests remaining consistent over time, the size of files continues to trend upward at an alarming rate. Creating larger sites may be okay in developed economies with strong networking infrastructures; however, users within developing economies could see a substantial lag in performance (which is especially important considering the price of mobile data). 3. Mobile is especially important for developing economies \nThe increase in website size and data usage comes at a time when mobile is vital within developing economies , as mobile is a lifeline connection for many countries. This assertion is reaffirmed by data from Google\u2019s Consumer Barometer. For illustration, I\u2019ve pulled device data to compare the US versus the developing economies of India and Kenya. The example clearly shows India and Kenya connect significantly more with mobile devices than desktop or tablet. 4. Like winter, more users are coming \nAt the same time, the internet doesn\u2019t show any signs of slowing down, especially not in developing countries. A recent eMarketer study on Internet Users Worldwide shows a high level of growth in developing countries, such as India, at 15.2 percent. Even the US saw a +2.2 percent bump in user growth! \nUser penetration as a percent of a country\u2019s total population shows there is still room for growth as well \u2014 especially in developing countries. 5. The divide in speed is growing \nIn the chart below, I choose nine developing countries (per the United Nations\u2019 World Economic Situation and Prospects report) to compare with the United States\u2019 internet speed (which ranked 10th worldwide in the last report). Despite the overarching trend of growth, there is a clear divide emerging in late 2012 \u2014 and it appears to be growing. [Click to enlarge] \nWhy is this significant? As internet connection speeds increase, so do page sizes. But as page sizes increase to match the fast speeds expected in developed nations, it means that users in developing nations are having a worse and worse experience with these websites. So, what should one do about it? \nThe data above paint a picture: Worldwide internet penetration worldwide continues to grow rapidly, especially in developing nations where mobile devices are the primary way to access the internet. At the same time, webpages are getting larger and larger \u2014 potentially leading to a poor user experience for internet users in developing nations, where average connection speeds have fallen far behind those in the US and other developed nations. \nHow can we address this reality to serve the needs of users in developing economies? Here are some tips: \nTest your mobile experience. \nAMP isn\u2019t necessary if your site leverages mobile web optimization techniques, runs lean and is the picture of efficiency; however, this is challenging (especially given today\u2019s web obesity crisis). Luckily, there are many tools that offer free speed analyses for webpages, including: Test My Site tool (via Think With Google) Page Speed Insights tool (via Google Developers) Mobile-Friendly Test (via Google Search Console) WebPageTest.org \nDevelop empathy through experience. \nAllow yourself to step into your customers\u2019 shoes and experience your site. As former CEO of Moz, Rand Fishkin, once aptly stated, \u201cCustomer empathy pretty much everything else.\u201d \nRegular empathy is hard. Empathy for people you don\u2019t know is nearly impossible. If we don\u2019t see the problem, feel it and internalize the challenge, we can\u2019t hope alleviate it. \nFacebook introduced a 2G Tuesdays, where employees logging into the company\u2019s app on Tuesday mornings are offered the option to switch to a simulated 2G connection for an hour to support empathy for users in the developing world. If you\u2019re looking to try something similar, any Chrome/Canary user can simulate any connection experience through Chrome Developer Tools through the Network Panel. \nConsider if AMP is right for your site. \nYou should entertain the thought of leveraging AMP as a primary experience if your brand meets the following criteria: Your site struggles with page-speed issues. You\u2019re doing business in a developing economy. You\u2019re doing business with a country with network infrastructure issues. The countries you target leverage browsers and search engines that support AMP.
