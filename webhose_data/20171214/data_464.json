Secondly, the Pro9542 Envelope System offers brilliant white and striking colour on colour envelopes \u2013 with exceptional, eye-catching results. \n\u201cDespite the great rise in direct marketing via email, consumers still see direct mail as more personal and trustworthy. Research by the Direct Marketing Association shows that in spite of the increasing number of online promotions direct mail still outperforms email; for example, its research showed that only 44% could recall a brand after an email campaign whereas 75% could do so after receiving direct mail,\u201d says Shun Mochizuki, Senior Marketing Manager, Small Format Printers, OKI Europe Ltd. \n\u201cHowever, because of the convenience of email 51% of businesses prefer to use a mixed campaign, hence the need for shorter but more impactful, attention-seeking runs. The Pro9\u2019s unparalleled ability to print CMKY + white and, in the case of the Pro9542, CMKY over white in one pass, will ensure print shops and print houses can offer something more striking and different than their competitors.\u201d \nOKI\u2019s Envelope Print System includes an envelope feeder and conveyer developed by OKI to help drive productivity. Easy to set up and with great media flexibility the Envelope System includes an Envelope Fuser to reduce wrinkle and ensure uniform print across a wide range of designs. It prints the broadest range of envelope sizes (C7 to 13\u201d by 15\u201d) at impressive speeds (up to 500 DL envelopes in under approximately 12 minutes). \nTo find out more visit www.oki.com/eu \nNotes to Editors: \nAbout OKI Europe OKI Europe Ltd is a division of OKI Data Corporation, a global business-to-business brand dedicated to creating cost effective, professional in-house printers, applications and services which are designed to increase the efficiency of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s businesses. \nThe company is well-established as one of Europe\u2019s leading printer brands, in terms of value and units shipped.

Many of these challenges also represent commercial opportunities for Irish businesses in the coming years to develop new technologies and services to help us transition to a zero carbon and resource efficient society. The Environmental Research Institute (ERI) at University College Cork launched its new Strategic Plan 2018-2022 today (Monday) and has a commitment of over \u20ac44 M investment in environmental research projects in the coming 3 years. \nPositioned at the forefront of environmental and sustainability research in Ireland, more than 300 researchers are currently engaged in ERI projects that are driving the organisation\u2019s agenda to address climate change, support the development of a circular economy, and maintain a healthy environment. Drawing from a team of interdisciplinary experts in environmental, energy, sustainable food, marine and sustainable materials research across University College Cork\u2019s schools and departments as well as affiliated research centres, the ERI\u2019s strategy for 2018 to 2022 aims to provide the necessary research and knowledge base to address our current environmental challenges.

Picture: Clare Keogh \nSpeaking at the launch of the ERI Strategic Plan, ERI Director Professor Sarah Culloty said, \u201cOur economies are approaching ecological limits, and we are already experiencing some of the constraints of operating outside planetary boundaries in areas such as climate change, biodiversity loss and resource depletion. We need to find new ways to reconcile our high levels of human development with environmental sustainability. Research holds the key to unlocking these major problems in very informed, practical and comprehensive ways, and we see the ERI playing a critical role in this regard. A key element of the strategic plan is working in partnership with local government, policy makers, civic society organisations and the public to co-create solutions that will ensure that our natural environment can be used sustainably to meet all our needs while providing a healthy living space.\u201d \n\u201cWe are excited about a number of flagship projects at UCC\u2019s ERI,\u201d said Prof. Anita Maguire, Vice President for Research & Innovation at UCC. \u201cFrom wave energy devices, to production of high-value materials and energy from waste, to protecting the quality of the air in our cities and towns, to working with the United Nations to develop training programmes to assess water quality, the ERI is building capacity in Ireland to address the many environmental challenges we currently face.\u201d \nThe ERI Strategic Plan 2018 \u2013 2022 outlines a number of objectives and targets for the organisation to grow its capacity and increase the impact of it research across all economic sectors, and society in the coming five years, under the leadership of Director of ERI Professor Sarah Culloty and the team at ERI. \n\u20ac44m investment in Environmental Research Projects at University College Cork added by TheCork.ie on 7th December, 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bryan smyth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anita maguire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul bolger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clare keogh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah culloty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clare keogh anita maguire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat o\u2019shea", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environmental research projects at university college cork", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environmental research institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucc vp of research & innovation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university college cork", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:32.159+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d57cb01314e4c586386fa9802cc2f5a29b270ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Zk1HhvmC1nFCeozPP3i.B5WPKPAvhoyhm0DtaQxa0wpupW4667tan5.oYk5j2phW5dZAkEQ0toXGKrqeuGc5vZrz8cVXl3wrsqN74jbmg6WQcWKVmqjxWGhl0HwJzWjbxACBJJed_i_2rj8lnjR2b2aLQ3Suy_Ss-", "site_full": "www.breakingnews.ie", "site": "breakingnews.ie", "site_section": "http://www.breakingnews.ie/rss/bn_all_rss.aspx", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Stories: BreakingNews.ie", "title": "Some fans bound to be disappointed by League Of Gentleman reboot, warns creator", "title_full": "Some fans bound to be disappointed by League Of Gentleman reboot, warns creator", "published": "2017-12-07T11:36:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/remote/content.assets.pressassociation.io/2017/12/06162501/1667bc94-acaa-409e-ac1f-24099ed2edb9.jpg?crop=0,0,4663,2623&ext=.jpg&width=600&s=bn-817577", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 28938, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d57cb01314e4c586386fa9802cc2f5a29b270ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Zk1HhvmC1nFCeozPP3i.B5WPKPAvhoyhm0DtaQxa0wpupW4667tan5.oYk5j2phW5dZAkEQ0toXGKrqeuGc5vZrz8cVXl3wrsqN74jbmg6WQcWKVmqjxWGhl0HwJzWjbxACBJJed_i_2rj8lnjR2b2aLQ3Suy_Ss-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BreakingNews.ie", "published": "2017-12-07T11:36:00.000+02:00", "title": "Some fans bound to be disappointed by League Of Gentleman reboot, warns creator", "text": "Showbiz Home \nThe return of The League Of Gentlemen may fail to win over existing fans, star and co-creator Reece Shearsmith has warned. \nIt will return on its 20th anniversary for three 30-minute episodes over the festive period but Shearsmith, who stars alongside Mark Gatiss and Steve Pemberton, said a reboot always runs the risk of disappointing fans. \nThe League Of Gentlemen\u2019s Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith in character (BBC/Ben Blackall) \nAsked if critics may deem it a mistake to bring it back, he said: \u201cYes, there is that worry, but if you thought too long about that, you wouldn\u2019t do it. \n\u201cOf course, even if this was better than the original League Of Gentlemen, there\u2019d be some who would say, \u2018They should never have done it and it\u2019s terrible now\u2019. \n\u201cBecause to them, it\u2019s in aspic as this brilliant thing and you meddle with it at your peril.

It\u2019s because the hugely popular mobile game has finally cut loose Google Maps in favor of using OpenStreetMap (OSM) for its in-game display. \nWhile Pok\u00e9mon Go has been using OSM under the hood to influence \u2018spawn points\u2019 within the game for over a year now, gamemaker Niantic (a Google company until 2015) had been using Google Maps for overworld landscaping. Until now. \nThe update was first spotted by users in Australia last week, and quickly validated by a Reddit thread from Canada. While the rollout seems to be gradual, the United States, South America and several Asian countries have already confirmed the visual changes. Comment from discussion liveaway\u2019s comment from discussion \"Pok\u00e9mon Go absolutely uses Open Street Map\" . \nOSM allows users to edit the map with their local knowledge of the geographical features around them. Which means, while Google Maps might not know that there is a pool or an underground garage in your building, OSM allows you to add a water body or another obscure landmark in your vicinity. (OSM, of course, expects its volunteers to be honest with their edits.) \nNow, while these changes translate into a better gaming experience for most users, there have been some instances where the results have been the complete opposite. Comment from discussion Owenlars2\u2019s comment from discussion \"Pok\u00e9mon Go absolutely uses Open Street Map\" . \nIf you have an active OSM user in your area, you should definitely see more details on the map. And if you don\u2019t, you can always take it as an opportunity to explore cartography. In essence, the OSM community is what makes the project so special. Thousands of volunteers from all around the globe are updating the map as their world changes around them. Every update is immediately visible to all other users and is version controlled. There are no corporate map cycle releases, approvals and KPIs that are typical to large organizations like Google. \nIntrigued?

The inside has some nice grain with a blue/green swirl (seems to dissipate/disappear near the dried cut ends). yes the wood seems to be quite green so I have sliced almost 20mm thick and stacked away for a rainy day next year Any help would be appreciated.

Dedicated investors may be looking to employ another tool for doing technical stock analysis. The   Williams %R is a technical indicator that was designed to measure overbought and oversold market conditions. The Williams %R indicator helps show the relative situation of the current price close to the period being observed. Profire Energy (PFIE)\u2019s   14 day Williams %R presently is at -73.91. In general, if the reading goes above -20, the stock may be considered to be overbought. Alternately, if the indicator goes under -80, this may show the stock as being oversold. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "profire energy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:34.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f7db9dc0bac5520c881eb737adfdcac484909d79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XVfy2TaBYxkA_zIlxihvNBmE4UxFUnTcH2UJpiaTgSmaiqHusRE0bGqLI03na9oCGeiNCeYJoF098fIEMQg8iw4.jUtGtD4yJJ9lJ5Q_FFA1OD7R12lXnAeIOyNy.GkOKVo6_cY8q4eNIeFOyfp8B9is1Ta_s4aWBw--", "site_full": "www.techrecur.com", "site": "techrecur.com", "site_section": "http://www.techrecur.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Worldwide Telecom and IT News Updates, Reviews, Trends, Analysis, PR", "title": "UltraSoC and Percepio partner to offer first complete embedded analytics platform for real-time systems", "title_full": "UltraSoC and Percepio partner to offer first complete embedded analytics platform for real-time systems", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f7db9dc0bac5520c881eb737adfdcac484909d79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XVfy2TaBYxkA_zIlxihvNBmE4UxFUnTcH2UJpiaTgSmaiqHusRE0bGqLI03na9oCGeiNCeYJoF098fIEMQg8iw4.jUtGtD4yJJ9lJ5Q_FFA1OD7R12lXnAeIOyNy.GkOKVo6_cY8q4eNIeFOyfp8B9is1Ta_s4aWBw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rimmy", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "UltraSoC and Percepio partner to offer first complete embedded analytics platform for real-time systems", "text": "  7, 2017 UltraSoC and Percepio partner to offer first complete embedded analytics platform for real-time systems \nCAMBRIDGE, United Kingdom, 6 December 2017 \u2013 UltraSoC , the leading provider of embedded analytics technology, and Percepio AB, the leading specialist in software tracing tools for real-time operating systems, today announced a partnership to produce the industry\u2019s most comprehensive solution for designing and debugging complete, robust real-time systems. Combining Percepio\u2019s Tracealyzer tools to provide insight into real-time behaviors in RTOS-based (real-time operating system) embedded software, with UltraSoC\u2019s hardware-based universal monitoring and analytics platform, the partnership allows embedded development teams to achieve enhanced system performance, as well as significant benefits in predictability, power, security and safety \u2013 plus reduced time-to-market and system development costs. Embedded software systems \u2013 which are at the heart of a variety of electronic products from lightweight IoT sensors to high-performance computing (HPC) platforms \u2013 are prone to sporadic errors that can be hard to spot and virtually impossible to predict or to prevent from reoccurring. At the same time, traditional chip design requires the use of debug tools to ensure the chip is ready for production. However, traditional hardware debug tools do nothing to spot nor to prevent changes or problems in the completed system in the field: these can significantly affect performance or power, impacting security and safety amongst other things. Percepio Connected Views Through this partnership, the Percepio and UltraSoC embedded debug tools are able to communicate and share essential information in real-time to ensure system-wide monitoring, effectively guaranteeing maximum performance and reliability. \n\u201cUltraSoC\u2019s universal semiconductor debug, monitoring and analytics platform is an ideal complement for our Tracealyzer visualizations,\u201d commented Johan Kraft, CEO and founder of Percepio. \u201cBy combining our tools and offering something the industry has never seen, there are significant opportunities available to both companies.\u201d \nUltraSoC CEO Rupert Baines added: \u201cI\u2019m excited to be able to address additional customer needs with Percepio\u2019s ground-breaking Tracealyzer tools. By having an out-of-the box offering that combines both software and hardware analytics that work perfectly together, the time-to-market and development cost savings we can both offer our customers will be significant.\u201d \nPercepio is widely used by designers using FreeRTOS, RTLinux and VxWorks, amongst other environments. UltraSoC\u2019s analytics IP is designed to be used across any hardware platform, providing semiconductor designers with embedded analytics and intelligence in hardware debug. Bringing these two toolsets together ensures system designers benefit from an integrated embedded analytics solution. Synchronizing Percepio\u2019s Tracealyzer with UltraSoC\u2019s IP modules gives system designers an unparalleled insight into their embedded hardware and software. \nPercepio\u2019s Tracealyzer embedded software debug tool offers unprecedented levels of insight into the run-time behavior of complex multi-threaded RTOS (Real Time Operating systems) or Linux-based software systems, allowing for improved development productivity, reduced time-to-market and better software quality. Tracealyzer is already used by companies with very demanding applications in industrial, robotics and drilling industries, amongst others. \nUltraSoC\u2019s embedded semiconductor IP simplifies development of such complex and powerful devices \u2013 even in heterogeneous multi-core systems. UltraSoC\u2019s embedded analytic features support developers of systems in a broad range of applications, such as: safety and security in the automotive industry, where the move towards autonomous vehicles is creating unprecedented change and risk; optimization in big data applications, from search to data centers; and cybersecurity, including for the Internet of Things. \nGraphic available to download, click here http://www.ultrasoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Percepio2_connected_views_new_3200x1800-blue-bkgnd.png \nAbout UltraSoC UltraSoC is an independent provider of SoC infrastructure that enables rapid development of embedded systems based on advanced SoC devices.

The company also plans for a return to growth in operating cash flow (adjusted EBITDA minus CAPEX) in 2017, followed by an acceleration of the growth rate in 2018 and continued growth in 2019 and 2020. The Group also confirmed the annual payment of a dividend of at least 0.65 euros per share for the years 2017 to 2020. \nAs the Group reached the halfway point in its Essentiels2020 plan, Orange reaffirmed its strategy. The Group's strategy seeks to leverage targeted investments that aim to reinforce the excellence of its networks and offer enriched services. \nThe Group said the deployment of fibre in France is now ahead of schedule allowing Orange to plan for 20 million FTTH connectable households in high-density and medium-density areas by 2021, rather than 2022. In Spain, Orange will reach 16 million FTTH connectable households in 2020 rather than the 14 million households that were initially planned and that will in fact be achieved as soon as 2018. \nThe Group aims to reach a peak investment spend of 7.4 billion euros in 2018, before declining from 2019. Orange said it will use a lean CAPEX programme to reduce unit costs by 15%, generating savings of up to 1 billion euros by the end of 2020. \nFor comments and feedback: contact This article appears in: World Markets , Stocks , Economy More from RTT News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "orange sets continuously improving objectives", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "reaffirms strategy orange sets continuously improving objectives", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ebitda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:35.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "915362fd7921c1d753560dc0b38b020ff5a69a43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2BAtnPWWozxI2cgYwzeOB4XfcibAWzYm3OjkUIbmJspupxutpkc32", "site_full": "ka4ayou.livejournal.com", "site": "livejournal.com", "site_section": "https://ka4ayou.livejournal.com/data/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Just Sport", "title": "7 December 2017: ka4ayou", "title_full": "7 December 2017: ka4ayou", "published": "2017-12-07T11:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://novapresspublisher.blob.core.windows.net/userposts-images/6VA1rxeuqX-14327.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "915362fd7921c1d753560dc0b38b020ff5a69a43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2BAtnPWWozxI2cgYwzeOB4XfcibAWzYm3OjkUIbmJspupxutpkc32", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "7 December 2017: ka4ayou", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:35.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bca6fdee58d4e28e13efde3c7b2d8c8e506f7f5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRbkKoVHuOVT61_LfZT_V38lmMMOLrtn5IG340tVFhnTZeFaQAhQ30vGvLMKhnboDYRF84rYT0YlpnoDnaqtVbmjsK8Jo9KwUsvhXxi48H8XjZdcIT9Cnuq_ypOE4dFxc0hpKoNxmNEXlcMWd0CAJCWrgx8W675UWIa9.1tMphIw.cy4us1fcjuCdflhUULwaE-", "site_full": "uniontradejournal.com", "site": "uniontradejournal.com", "site_section": "http://uniontradejournal.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Union Trade Journal", "title": "Heading Higher or Stalling Out?

Security needs to be built into the data management platform from an end user\u2019s computer to backup storage, regardless of whether it resides on-premise or in a private, public or hybrid Cloud. In today\u2019s digital economy, the definition of disaster recovery has expanded to include the Cloud, endpoints and recovery speed, along with the technology businesses need to meet these new challenges. Disasters can include a CEO\u2019s laptop data being held for ransom by a cybercriminal or a failure to find data needed for an eDiscovery motion.Key disaster recovery capabilities have evolved to include Cloud backup, archive, eDiscovery and search. Businesses need an automated data protection solution that provides a single, complete view of all stored data so they can rapidly recover data whenever they need to resume business \u2014 even in the face of a ransomware threat. A recent Forrester Research report, \u201cThe Forrester Wave: Data Resiliency Solutions, Q3 2017,\u201d identified four key data resiliency tools. These include dev-test teams to ensure accurate test environments, business reporting and analytics teams to process data in real time, legal and compliance teams to protect the business with immediate insights, and security and risk teams to safeguard customers and other stakeholders. The key to protecting Cloud-based data from a ransomware attack is speed. In the digital economy, enterprises demand 24/7/365 access to the web, mobile and other applications. Any delay in being able to access these applications will not only result in potential immediate financial loss but also damage to an organization\u2019s reputation, which can linger for years.

That\u2019s what was scary. \n\u201cYou can learn an accent but when you\u2019re paying attention to that, and Jessica felt the same way, you know, how do we make these real women, who were so over the top, seem like real people and not just a caricature? \n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what terrified me. But then, I\u2019m always drawn to things that terrify me.\u201d \nSarandon said when producer Ryan Murphy approached her about his idea as a film project she thought it seemed like \u201ca one joke story\u201d. \nWhen it was reinvented for the small screen, she felt it gave a more complex, in-depth view of what was behind Davis and Crawford\u2019s feud and what it says about Hollywood and ageing. \nDavis and Crawford were in their 50s when the psychological horror film Whatever Happened To Baby Jane? was made in 1962 but at the time they were seen as washed up. \nSusan Sarandon (Ian West/PA) \nSarandon said: \u201cIt certainly hits a chord. \n\u201cI mean, I think when I started out acting, I thought that I\u2019d be over by 40. \n\u201cI think a lot of us that have survived pushed the gate a little bit further down, but it\u2019s still a fact that there\u2019s a lack of imagination in terms of people coming up with stories. \n\u201cWith Bette and Joan, these women were always after quality parts and they fought for that from the beginning of their careers, and that\u2019s how they ended up at this point in their lives when they couldn\u2019t find a decent part. \n\u201cThen, with Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?, these were two big parts and a new genre, and they said, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s try it. We don\u2019t have much choice\u2019. That was a risky thing.\u201d \n:: Feud: Bette And Joan starts on BBC2 on Saturday December 16 at 9pm.

A variety of factors are in play which will impact how your results will be achieved. Keep reading for great advice on how you need to approach muscle building to get it to really work for you and produce optimum results.\nConsider drinking a protein shake before starting your weight-training workouts. Liquid minerals tend to be absorbed quicker in the body than solid food, so think about having a shake filled with protein, about 10 to 20 grams. The protein shake will help give you a boost of protein to encourage protein synthesis, which is the way to building muscles.\nAfter bodybuilding workout sessions, be sure to rest well. Many people fail to do this after their workouts, which can be detrimental to their building larger muscle mass. It is when you are resting that your body grows and repairs itself. If you fail to rest after muscle development workouts, or you cut the rest period short, this over training can prevent your body from becoming larger. As you can see, it is important to refrain from cutting back on rest periods that your body needs.\nSetting up sort-term goals and a reward system for meeting those goals can go a long way for improving your motivation. You will need motivation in order to be able to keep going with this because it takes time. Try setting up rewards that can assist you in your quest of gaining muscle. As an example, get a massage, which will help increase your blood flow and benefits muscle growth.\nIt is extremely important that you stand correctly when doing standing exercises, such as overhead presses and squats. These exercises call for a type of athletic stance. In order to achieve this, you should stand with your feet at about the width of your shoulders. Then, slightly point your toes outward, bend the knees, and arch your lower back. Always make sure that your eyes are looking forward.\nAim to maintain a journal when following a workout regimen. Jot down the exercises that you do, the number of sets and reps you do, and anything else concerning your workout. hop over to this website should write down how much rest you get each night and even how you feel during workouts. Writing down everything that you can allows you to better keep track of how you are doing every single week.\nEat plenty of protein when you are on a muscle-building regimen. Be sure to eat whole proteins with every meal. A good rule to follow is to ingest one gram of protein for each pound of body weight. http://pinclock1benito.amoblog.com/weight-loss-tips-you-ll-desire-you-d-heard-sooner-6068396 of low-fat protein include fish, low-fat milk and lean red meats.\nDo not skimp on the amount of sleep you get. The process of building and repairing your muscles happens while you sleep, and without adequate recovery, you run the risk of hurting yourself during workouts. Get 7-9 hours of sleep each night to maximize the benefits of the exercises you perform.\nTry the farmer\u2019s walk in order to make your cardio exercise a more productive part of your muscle-building workouts. Hold a dumbbell in each hand at your sides and keep your abdominal muscles sucked in tight while you walk. Start off with a ten-minute walk, and aim to increase this to 20 minutes as you practice.\nAs you become more experienced in working out, it\u2019s very important that you make sure to adjust the amount of weight you lift. Once you get stronger, you are either going to have to increase your weight or your reps in order to get that pump you need for achieving additional muscle growth. Try to increase gradually the amount of weight you lift to ensure that you don\u2019t overexert yourself.\nProtein is an extremely important nutrient on the menu of bodybuilders, and tuna is a great source of protein. In addition to being very high in protein, tuna also provides some of the good oils a healthy diet requires. Convenience is also a consideration, and tuna can be eaten alone or mixed in a salad or fill a sandwich.\nTry out partial reps in order to grow muscles. This technique involves doing reps with a decreased range of motion. On occasion, these are called pulse reps, and they are done at the end of a set as soon as you hit failure. Although you might not have enough strength to perform a complete rep, you can try out some partial reps until you reach failure a second time in order to put more demand on your muscles.\nWorking out can be a very fulfilling experience, but it is one that must be done in an intelligent manner. Never use a new machine or free weight without practicing the proper form first and always be sure to start off with a very low amount of weight as a practice.\nWorking out can be a very fulfilling experience, but it is one that must be done in an intelligent manner. Never use a new machine or free weight without practicing the proper form first and always be sure to start off with a very low amount of weight as a practice.\nBe careful about which exercises you perform with heavier weights, because not all movements are designed to be done with extra bulk. Exercising your neck, doing split squats, and doing dips can all compromise your joints and put you in jeopardy of getting seriously injured. Some exercises where you can safely use larger weights include: presses, rows and deadlifts.\nMake sure you are getting enough protein, but that it is also coming from good sources. You will ideally consume 1.5g of protein for every kilo of body mass. Fish and lean meats are great sources of healthy protein, although limited servings of red meat can mean creatine, which helps. Protein supplements can be used to get to your target number, but should never replace food.\nMake sure you watch your diet will you build muscle. Hydration is very important, as water comprises 70% of your total muscle mass. Do not drink excessively when building muscles; alcohol causes muscle tissue to break down, which defeats the purpose of building your muscles.\n\nKeep junk food out of your house. If this bad food isn\u2019t stored somewhere in the home, you aren\u2019t as likely to consume it. Junk food increases the amount of fat on your body and decreases your ability to grow muscle.

Trend Micro Incorporated ( TYO: 4704 ; TSE: 4704 ), a global leader in cybersecurity solutions , predicts the trend of known vulnerabilities being used in major attacks will continue in 2018 as corporate attack surfaces expand and expose more security holes. Patch management and employee education should be prioritized for all executives to protect an organization\u2019s most critical data. As information technology and operational technology (IT/OT) continue to converge, enterprise applications and platforms will be at risk of manipulation and vulnerabilities, as stated in Trend Micro\u2019s 2018 predictions report. Additionally, Trend Micro predicts an increase in Internet of Things vulnerabilities as more devices are manufactured without security regulations or industry standards. Overall, the increased connectivity and enlarged attack surface present new opportunities for cybercriminals to leverage known issues to penetrate a corporate network. Ransomware will continue to be a mainstay due to its proven success. There will be an increase in targeted ransomware attacks, in which the criminals go after a single organization to disrupt operations and force a larger ransom payout. Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks will also continue to gain popularity with attackers, as the return on investment for successful attacks is quite high. \u201cWe foresee that the ransomware business model will still be a cybercrime mainstay in 2018, while other forms of digital extortion will gain more ground. The ransomware attacks will manifest itself in a more \u2018Specialized\u2019 and \u2018Targeted manner\u2019 , unlike the earlier approach. With respect to India, in 2018 we will experience more number of attacks targeted at the ATMs, especially malware attacks. We also expect to see a rise in security incidents across Public Cloud platforms,\u201d said Nilesh Jain, Country Manager, India & SAARC, Trend Micro. \u201cWe at Trend Micro are constantly scouting out future threats that will have the greatest impact for businesses, and we predict which vulnerabilities will make the biggest waves in the coming year,\u201d said Rik Ferguson, VP of security research for Trend Micro . \u201cMany devastating cyberattacks in 2017 leveraged known vulnerabilities that could have been prevented had they been patched beforehand. This trend will continue next year as corporate attack surfaces expand and expose more security holes. While this remains a challenge for enterprises, executives should prioritize vulnerability management as they make 2018 cybersecurity plans, particularly in the looming shadow of GDPR implementation.\u201d \u201cThe private sector continues to be under siege from a variety of cyber threats,\u201d said Edwin Martinez, chief information security officer for CEC Entertainment . \u201cInstitutions must continue to share critical information so we can better prevent and respond to these cyber threats limiting exposure to sensitive data.\u201d Threat actors will also leverage growing technologies, like blockchain and machine learning, to enhance obfuscation against traditional cybersecurity protections. For this reason, the company recommends a layered, cross-generational defense strategy, which combines the latest security techniques with proven tactics that reinforce nearly 30 years of experience protecting some of the biggest global brands.

I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that this runs small. I found it ran true to the size chart.I am typically a size 2 in pants and a 4 or 6 in a dress or jacket/ blazer. My measurements are 37-27-37 and I wear a 36C bra. I ordered a 6 because of the bust and was concerned it would be too tight. However, it fits perfectly, but would say someone who wears an A or a B cup would find it a little big. If a D cup, would probably still be OK if overall not broader than the 37 measurement but would likely show more cleavage. I think a 38 might be pushing it and anything under 35 without a bigger cup size would be too big.The waist is a little snug when zipping it. But once zipped all the way up and adjusted to lay properly, it fit perfectly. In fact, it looks just like the picture on me and it really shows the curves making my waist look really tiny. I do plan to lose about 5 pounds (128 now and 5\u20197\u2033) which would bring my waist down to a 26 or 26 1/2 which would make sure that the zipper doesn\u2019t pull at all, since I don\u2019t have any wiggle room in the waist. The hips definitely are fine and an inch up or down at 36 or 38 would still work fine.I\u2019m not planning to wear this until September when we go to the Caribbean, but didn\u2019t want to take the chance of it not being available because I absolutely love it. The leopard print is the softest satin. The black isn\u2019t quite as soft or shiny, but still beautiful with some sheen which actually makes the leopard stand out even more.

I am looking for a couple of smart solutions to put throughout the house mainly for music, both can link the speakers but biggest advantage echo has is connecting to other bluetooth speakers (google home needs chomecast music to do this). Also a abenefit with Echo is the excellent IOT devices already being sold on Amazon - which I will slowly start integrating into my home as well. Who owns what and what would you recommend? Posts 26 I own a home mini, very happy with it. I also have a chromecast and \"smart\" plugs. I think it will depend on what you want to do. For general questions home is better, in fact much better. The echo has an advantage on skills and IoT support, but Google is catching up fast and will eventually surpass Amazon in my opinion. If you want music you will either have to get a chromecast or go for the Echo as the home mini speaker is decent but not nearly good enough for music. You can get the Max speaker though or even get the new Sonos speaker that will support home and echo.

You can get the Max speaker though or even get the new Sonos speaker that will support home and echo. I won't use the mini or dot as want to pair that with other speakers. The echo is nice as you can pair with other \"cheapish\" speakers for great output. I don't really care about things like \"how far is the moon from Earth\". Unfortunately I am in the Apple ecosystem at the moment, iphone, apple tv, apple watch, apple music etc. Can't move away from apple music as use the music on my watch every morning in gym which is amazing and flawless. Alexa can go into Tunein at least and other free stations. Google better with Deezer integration. I was thinking of something like this, if I go alexa. Goes on special for 50$ almost every week - nice thing about this it has battery as well https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0...O2CUA5WI&psc=1 Then get 2 echo dots as well in other areas of the house.
