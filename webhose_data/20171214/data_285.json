We also need assurance from the Indian side that their products will be used by the end user,\" Kaldov told PTI here.It has been a long-standing grievance of the Indian armed forces that supply of critical spares and equipment from Russia takes a long-time, affecting maintenance of military systems procured from Moscow.Terming it a \"complicated issue\", Kaldov said Rostec was cooperating with Indian defence ministry to address the problem and manufacturing company Russian Helicopters plans to create service in India on the principle of \"one window\", which will simplify and accelerate the work in this direction.\"This is a pilot project and India is the first country where it is being implemented. India is interested in the implementation of this project, as it is operating the largest fleet of Russian helicopters,\" he said.Russia has been a major supplier of military platforms to India.Kladov said Rostec companies were interested in increasing the efficiency of after-sales service and simplifying the procedures for supply of spare parts to India.\"About a year ago, the Government of Russia decided to grant the right to a number of major Russian defence industry companies to directly conduct after-sales service, repair and modernisation of previously delivered military hardware.\"Now Russian Helicopters, United Engine Corporation, Techmash, Schwabe and High-Precision Weapons can directly interact with Indian customers on these issues,\" he said.Kaldov noted that the very sophisticated defence equipment needed to be addressed in a specific workshop and licensed parts and spares should be used and technology of repair should be controlled by the manufacturer and the chief designer of the products.\"This is an issue which is both sided. And our rule is to provide life time support for the equipment. Sometimes the end user becomes opportunistic and its looking to buy spares elsewhere to make it cheaper. So they are outsourced in other countries,\" he said.Kaldov said he had pointed out the concerns of the Russian companies regarding production of spares in India in his recent meeting with an Indian minister.He said the company was offered a space to set up a facility to produce components, spares for electronics, machinery, engines and helicopters in Maharashtra.Kaldov said Indian officials have told them that Russian manufacturers to participate in international tender exercise if they want to sell their products to the Indian armed forces.\"We will set up facilities and this can only be done if the Indian government assures that the Russian products will be purchased,\" he said.Speaking on the issue of India inching closer to the US and Israel in terms of defence deals and procurement, Kladov said he did not see it as a threat, but as a challenge for Russia as the market is becoming more competitive.\"We don't see it as a threat rather as a challenge. It gives us thrust to do better and be more innovative and proactive. We don't fear competition. Let's look at the broader picture, its industrial cooperation, strategic trust which gives us a cutting edge,\" he said.Calling the relationship between India and Russia a \"privileged strategic partnership\", Kladov said it meant \"we trust our Indian partners with most sensitive defence inventions and achievements\".\"America has many competitive products to offer. It's for Indian government to choose. It's up for the Indian government to build up balances. I can only speak on behalf of the Russian side. We are firm friends and strategic partners of the Indian republic,\" he said.

Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) was banking on the mine in the country's east to supply a big chunk of its raw material needs for a multi-billion-dollar expansion of its steel production capacity. \nSAIL produces only around 800,000 tonnes a year from a section of the Chiria mine but was targeting to raise that to 7 million tonnes in the next few years, to lift its steel capacity nearly four times to 50 million tonnes by 2030/31. \"Getting forest clearance for the mine under existing guidelines is a challenge,\" Sunil Kumar Barnwal, the mines secretary of Jharkhand state where the mine is located, told Reuters. \n\"There are also special environmental conditions in Saranda forest region that need to be fulfilled to get clearance.\" Saranda is home to endangered species of flying lizards and is also an integral part of an elephant corridor. But years of mining around the area by various companies have led to a 21 percent drop in the elephant population between 2010 and 2016, according to an environment ministry report. \nThe federal government is now considering stopping all mining activity in the area, two government sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. If the expansion does not go through, it would also be a disappointment for resources conglomerate Adani Enterprises, which was working on bidding for a contract to operate the mine on behalf of SAIL. \nAdani, which has been struggling to secure funding for a big coal project in Australia, is looking to enter the iron ore and copper mining business in India amid soft demand for other businesses such as coal trading, analysts say. \nSAIL and Adani did not respond to requests for comment. An environment ministry spokesman did not comment. Chiria has proven reserves of around 1 billion tonnes and SAIL had announced its ongoing modernisation and expansion plans factoring in iron ore from the mine, said a company source. SAIL's other iron ore mines have reserves likely to last only up to eight years more, added the source, who declined to be named as he did not have permission to talk to the press.

But we shan\u2019t do them all, let\u2019s not exaggerate. Five more will do, we\u2019ll tackle the remaining ones next year if you don\u2019t mind\u2026 Ledaig 11 yo (48%, The Single Malts of Scotland, Time Series, 319 bottles, 2016) I find it great to place emphasis on time rather than on wood, as just everyone is doing these days in lumberjac\u2026 I mean, in whisky. I tell you, some will soon distil oak instead of grains, that will be quicker. Colour: white wine. Nose: simple, easy, perfect. Some inky smoke (newspaper of the day), and whiffs of moss after a rain, plus brine and kippers. Not the Kippers of the Cake, mind you. Mouth: thoroughly excellent, clean, smoky, rather medicinal, with a superb herbal background. Fir, pinesap, then lemongrass and smoky/salty oils. Finish: medium to long, salty, very clean and well-defined. What we call \u2018a blade\u2019 at WF Towers \u2013 and yet we\u2019re no fencers. Comments: I was just thinking, the other distillery that would be issuing such perfect youngsters would be Caol Ila. Caol Ila and Ledaig, same struggle? Or, yeah, perhaps Bowmore, you\u2019re very right\u2026 SGP:457 - 89 points. But back to the wackier years\u2026 Ledaig 19 yo 1997/2016 (53.9%, Cadenhead, Single Cask, bourbon hogshead, 252   more maturity in this one, and yet no Ledaiggy off-notes, rather some kind of bold, rather liqueury, and pretty herbal arrival, with some sage, parsley, moss, humus, then kelp, floated wood, oysters, and kippers. A forest near the Atlantic, I\u2019d say. Very nice, and rather intriguing. With water: sea breeze, a walk on the beach (that wouldn\u2019t be Ibiza, rather Machir), tissues, and Altoids. Both were kept in the very same pocket for years. Mouth (neat): Cadenhead are often having singular casks, and after all that\u2019s the whole point of bottling single casks, isn\u2019t it. Beautiful resinous/sappy style, then lemons and moss, then a very brine-y smokiness with also ashes and notes of this bizarre, yet sometimes fantastic wine they have in Greece, retsina. With water: we\u2019re going towards Loire wines, I mean the drier ones. Ideas of a proper old Muscadet \u2013 nah of course not the cheap junk they have in supermarkets. Finish: medium, and very costal. Comments: on oysters, on oysters! SGP:366 - 90 points. Ledaig 15 yo 2001/2017 (48.4%, Douglas Laing, Old Particular, refill hogshead, cask #11605, 255 bottles) Ah, this is interesting, will this already be a \u20182000s\u2019 style or still a \u20181990s\u2019? Colour: straw. Nose: ooh, nice! It\u2019s got the smell of that brand new Harley-Davidson I bought in the very early 1990s. No, really, not making this up. Tyres, leatherette, metal polish, and relatively fresh paint. That was before I changed the carb, the saddle, the paintwork, the pipes, the crankshaft, the ignition box, and a few other details. But why am I telling you all this? Mouth: shall we call this a \u2018transition\u2019 Ledaig? It\u2019s already got the newer ones\u2019 clean and smoky/zesty style, and yet there are a few remaining \u2018dirtier\u2019 aspects, such as these tiny touches of artichokes and, well, used matches. Indeed, there is something slightly sulphury to this. Ala Benrinnes, if you will. Finish: long, with the sulphury notes coming to the front. That\u2019s the distillate, I suppose. Comments: a mid-period Ledaig, shall we say. A very interesting transitional vintage\u2026 (of course vintages do matter with whisky, it\u2019s just that vintages are the result of Man\u2019s will, not nature\u2019s). SGP:366 - 83 points. Ledaig 10 yo 2005/2016 (57.3%, Signatory Vintage, first fill sherry butt, cask #900151, 650 bottles) I\u2019d wager this one will be quite beastly\u2026 Colour: gold. Nose: it\u2019s not that the sherry cask did annihilate the distillate\u2019s fiery behaviour, but I wouldn\u2019t say this one sings loud. Muddy tar and smoke, minerals, walnuts, sulphur (stone)\u2026 Well as they say in D.C., the jury\u2019s still out\u2026 With water: it\u2019s still out. Mouth (neat): ah, this is rather better, even if there\u2019s some glue and varnish, and even a slightly acetone-y feeling. Extremely aggressive, smoky and sour, bitterish, very rough\u2026 In short it\u2019s rather one for the hipflask. With water: bittersweet and a tad sour. Careful with water, it doesn\u2019t swim too well. Finish: medium, a tad acetic. Good when at natural strength, but water kind of disjoints it. Well water almost destroys it, in fact. Comments: my cats like water better. SGP:366 - 80 points. Ledaig 11 yo 2005/2017 (61.8%, Cadenhead, Authentic Collection, butt, 450 bottles) Colour: gold. Nose: an earthy sherriness over a thick layer of burnt walnuts and a lot of earthy Pu-erh tea, tobacco, and new leather. Behind that, the most medicinal combination of brine and iodine. New lineoleum and Bakelite (as far as I can remember). With water: we had mentioned Uigeadail before, and we\u2019ll do it again. More linoleum, dried kelp, old engine oil, tobacco, walnuts\u2026 Mouth (neat): very punchy, heavy, salty\u2026 Some pungent black tea, some pepper, bitter oranges, a little ginger and juniper\u2026 Boy this is heavy! With water: gets more sooty and ashy, and salty as well. Finish: as long as one of Fidel\u2019s most historical speeches, bitter and smoky, with bitter oranges, salt, pepper, and leather. Comments: a beast that\u2019s sometimes as subtle as a sledgehammer \u2013 but I liked it a lot. SGP:377 - 87 points. Good, four*five = twenty Ledaigs altogether, I\u2019d say that is more than enough. Hasta la vista, I\u2019m thanking for your understanding. (And gracias, Tom!)

PTI takes no editorial responsibility for the same).Mindlogicx Singapore Debuts World's First Intelligent Device- based Ecosystem With Just-in-Time Device-based Solution BANGALORE, December 7, 2017/PRNewswire/ -- Cloud-based, WiFi and biometric access-enabled IntelliPAD\u00ae launches new era for test-taking Mindlogicx Singapore Pte Ltd (\"Mindlogicx\") has launched the world's first intelligent device-based ecosystem just-in- time device-based solution at the Ritz Carlton Singapore, a foolproof and tamper-proof e-ink device that will enable exam administrators to conduct high-stakes tests using biometric and encryption technologies. Dubbed IntelliPAD\u00ae, the device's release comes amid a global rise in exam malpractice; such as question paper leakage, candidate impersonation and other illegal means of obtaining question papers for personal use or resale. The mounting pressure on examination boards has led to calls for tighter surveillance and security on exam production and delivery. IntelliPAD\u00ae will address the above issues by delivering individual question papers to the right candidate at a set time, using candidates' biometric authentication. The six-inch e-ink device securely obtains the question paper and other relevant data from a family of interconnected devices linked to KenCLOUD, a private cloud-based service offered by Mindlogicx. The whole process is done with minimal human intervention. IntelliPAD\u00ae works with the KenCLOUD-powered connected devices, such as IntelliSYS and IntelliSENSE, by securely mapping data. It prevents impersonation and exam centre hijacking by establishing a geofencing zone, as well as marking attendance automatically and auto-destructing the question paper once the exam is complete. The user-friendly ecosystem also encourages users to go green by completely eliminating the need to print question papers. Each device will create and operate its own private network and communicate with other linked devices to deliver question papers, and does not require an internet connection to do so. This enables exams to be conducted in urban and rural exam centres alike. The devices also have built-in security features that prevent tampering of any kind. The IntelliEXAMS\u00ae software, which is integrated with the IntelliPAD\u00ae ecosystem, offers functions that span the entire assessment cycle; from candidate registration, fee management and ticket generation to the digitisation of handwritten answer scripts, on-screen evaluation and result processing. It has serviced more than 3.6 million students to date, with over 28.68 million question papers delivered. Mr. Suresh Elangovan, CEO of Mindlogicx, said, \"Top universities and professional certification providers have seen an epidemic of exam fraud in recent years. We are pleased to have pioneered the world's first device-centric solution to this phenomenon, and believe that this heralds a new era in education and test-taking.\" Mindlogicx is setting up a global technology delivery centre, called MNOC, in Singapore this month. The office will employ about 60 staff, of which about 50 are local, and will serve as a global delivery and R&D centre. \"Singapore is not only highly regarded as a financial and technological hub, but also represents a gateway to the fast- growing Southeast Asian market, which will serve as the ideal launchpad for our global rollout,\" Mr. Elangovan added.About Mindlogicx Mindlogicx (http://www.mindlogicx.com) is a global knowledge engineering and technology delivery company.

While text is generally not going to change significantly between editions, blurbs can be extremely variable - the editions I have at home show quite different blurbs from those reported here. Given this fact, I did not see the point in having them around.

But he wasn't an equal because he was at all material times a child. \n\"You used him to satisfy your sexual needs. \n\"You have made him out to be a liar and have portrayed yourself as the victim in all this. But it is you who has been lying. \n\"This relatively short-lived behaviour was very much out of character and you have lost that character in the most spectacular way.\" \nAfter Leather had been sentenced a man walked from the public gallery and said to the jury: \"I am Amanda's father and she is only guilty of being a nice person!\" \nLeather denied having any sexual contact with the boy when she gave evidence at the trial. \nShe claimed the text messages from her phone had been sent maliciously by the victim to his own phone. \nCatherine Silverton, mitigating, said Leather had no previous convictions and continued to deny the offence. \nShe said: \"She has now lost her job, her home and the majority of her friends and colleagues.\" \nThe barrister said Leather would struggle to cope with life in custody. \nAfter the case, Det Insp Vanessa Rolfe, of Wakefield Child Safeguarding Team, said: \u201cWe welcome the custodial sentence she has received today. \n\u201cShe fully knew her victim was underage and still pursued a sexual relationship with what was a vulnerable teenager who she plied with alcohol and drugs. \n\u201cSafeguarding detectives and the CPS believe this was a clear cut case of sexual grooming and the jury has agreed. \n\u201cOn her release from prison Leather will now have to sign on the sexual offences register, and I hope this case serves as a warning of the sentences those who carry out these sort of offences can expect to face.\u201d Follow Us On", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amanda leather have", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "catherine silverton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "det insp vanessa rolfe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leather", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard woolfall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amanda leather", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recorder sophie drake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amanda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yorkshire evening post woman", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wakefield child safeguarding team", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leeds crown court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wakefield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coxley lane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leeds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middlestown", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:33:28.062+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5be8eabc94c0dd0060c7d2a27d58803ddd2f6e80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2HT48I_PlzDc", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/co/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/co/ - Comics &amp; Cartoons - 4chan", "title": "/swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics", "title_full": "/co/ - /swco/ - Star Wars Comics & Cartoons - Comics & Cartoons - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T05:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 493, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "76c14d6c33400b1bc7055a789be5ba77b634829e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pxPUxg3fc_mskVQgyLJ2M2O8Y28vcGd_1r6QuVoSSl5E-", "ord_in_thread": 368, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T09:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>97330361\n>>97330378\nThe punishment is that you are pretty much have to chose the dark side option to not hear a long Kreia ramble.\nUnlike the KOTOR scene, you can't just say no and part ways.
