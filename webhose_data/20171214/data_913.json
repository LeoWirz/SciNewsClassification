City being torn apart here, we seriously have to go for Fonseca after Allardyce.

Ive been told not to worry about my GPU getting to hot as the back fan will kick on way before temperatures get to high.\nSeems that the ICX sensors in the FTW2 that control the card is a bit fancy for a mining rig or that the OS is not liking/over-riding the slave bios back fan settings. Maybe the SC edition is the more miner friendly one. Also they only need one 8-pin connection instead of two 8-pins.\nMy cards get up to 68-70c by the time the back fan spins up. I just want them to run all the time:(\npost edited by vSpike - 2017/12/06 21:15:23 #17", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

The group noted that the choice of the present Minister for youth was a wrong one as he\u2019s far above the stipulated age to be addressed as youth. \n\u201cWe contributed the largest votes, yet, we are the ones that are jobless and taken for granted, We will not accept this anymore, \u201cHe said. \nAdepoju said lots of corrections can still be made to pacify the youths by providing employment for youths who are roaming around the streets. \nHe said youths stakeholders will consult and agree on a particular presidential candidate to support in the 2019 general election. \nAdepoju said the united efforts of the Youths was the reason for the technical defeat of Nnamdi Kanu. \u201cWe were united and we all agreed that we will not support his sentimental agitation. Had it been we gave him support, it would have been another story today. \n\u201cHow many youths are in his cabinet, in fact the president has not deemed it fit to appreciate efforts of youths stakeholders in supporting him to kill the bad intentions of Nnamdi Kanu. \n\u201cInstead, people who were not part of the struggle were the ones being commended, In fact the vice President met with them who were mostly elders, This to us is not good enough. \nAdepoju said the Nigerian youths have decided that only a presidential candidate irrespective of his/her political party that will give youths attention will get their support in 2019. \n\nShare This Post on Facebook!

Chiamaka have been severally harassed and raped by her uncle. Last week, this little girl declined and was brutally tortured to almost stupor by this callous uncle. After much beaten, she succumb and was again raped with blood gushing out of her body. She could hardly go to school with her tattered uniform and excruciating pains from both the rape and torture she got from this animal called uncle. When she opened her body yesterday, with marks of wire all over her back, chest and stomach, and narrated her ordeal to her teacher, the school immediately called the police. The uncle was apprehended and his wife who is an elder sister to Chiamaka\u2019s mother surprisingly was ignorant of this wickedness perpetuated by her husband. I guess you can\u2019t look at her private part without a lion heart\u2026 You can\u2019t but cry. Thanks to the Nigerian police (QRS) as their investigations keeps on inspiring us and we shall pursue this case to a reasonable conclusion to ensure justice is done. We had to admit this young girl who could barely walk at the hospital yesterday. Why this rapes and sexual harassment against the girl child? Why this gender violence against this child. It was as if I should just execute this idiot but the law must take her course even if my last penny will go for it.

The Global Tissue Engineering is defined as it is a combination of the cells, Materials methods, Engineering and suitable biochemical and physio-chemical factors which is to improve and to replace biological tissues. The Tissue Engineering is also counting the use of some framework or some procedures for the formation of the new viable tissues for the use of Biochemical and Biomedical Practices or Uses. The terminology regenerative medicines are also based upon the tissue engineering techniques furthermore it involves the regenerative medicines place more emphasis on the use of the stem cells or progenitor cells to make up the tissues.\nTissue Engineering Market Also, the tissue engineering is also used in the incidences of accidents, birth defects and the mishaps account for 10 million cosmetic procedures across the globe due to the help of tissue engineering technologies and other technologies. Also, the tissue engineering and the organ expansion or the regeneration market, which is upsurge in the market for the metals and its alloys that has been used for the implantation of the body and the various body parts.\nIn-Depth research report on Tissue Engineering Market: \nhttps://www.millioninsights.com/industry-reports/tissue-engineering-market \nFor the use and reliable for the human, effective and cost-effective alternatives have driven the need for in-vitro testing with the human equivalents. The use of animals for the testing of the various medicines also the use of animals is takes place for the models has raised different ethical issues and hence the request for the tissue engineered human equivalents is enormously growing at the faster rate.\nDifferent rats and mice models were used for the performing of toxicity and efficacy testing and this is now rapidly being replaced by the reconstructed epidermal tissues.The Cell cultural technology, stem cell technology and the immunopassivation and the immunomodulation have the widened the reach of the key players as it is the creating a full new knowledge base for the treating the different conditions. Also, the Cardiovascular surgeries is also creating sustainable opportunity for the market growth.\nTissue Engineering Market is segmented, By Applications as Orthopedics, musculoskeletal and spine, Neurology, Cardiology & vascular, Cord blood & cell banking, Cancer, GI & gynecology, Dental, Skin/integumentary, Urology.The Orthopedic application is growing and the number of reconstructive and the replacement of the surgeries are going so the increase in the growth of the market is takes place. There is increase in the population growing demand for the new technologies, also the tissue engineering is feeling the gap between the demand and the lack of supply of the orthopedic products.\nFor instance, in March 2016, researchers from the University of Alabama found a reprogramming factor, which could increase the efficiency of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (HiPSCs). They are generated without destroying the human embryo. The promising segment and the cumulative number of researches undertaken in the field of neurology the which is one of the fastest increasing segments owing to the broader scope of expansion offered by this segment.\nTissue Engineering Market is segmented, By Geographical Region North America (U.S. and Canada),Asia Pacific (China, India, Japan, ASEAN, Australia, and New Zealand), Middle East and

the Year' By Published Thursday, December 07, 2017 \nAn Indonesian monkey who shot to fame after it snapped a grinning selfie -- and sparked a landmark US copyright case -- was named \"Person of the Year\" Wednesday by the animal rights group that took on the simian's cause. \nThe People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said it was honouring Naruto, a crested black macaque with a goofy-looking grin, to recognise that \"he is someone, not something\". \nIn 2011, the monkey pressed the shutter button while staring down the lens of a camera set up British nature photographer David Slater on the island of Sulawesi. \nThe photos quickly went viral and PETA launched a lawsuit that claimed the then six-year-old Naruto should be \"declared the author and owner of his photograph\". \n\"Naruto's historic selfie challenged the idea of who is a person and who is not and resulted in the first-ever lawsuit seeking to declare a nonhuman animal the owner of property, rather than being declared property himself,\" PETA Founder Ingrid Newkirk said in a statement Wednesday. \nThe court case set off an international debate among legal experts about personhood for animals and whether they can own property. \nSlater maintained he owned the rights to the pictures since he engineered its creation -- setting up the tripod and walking away for a few minutes, only to find out that the monkey had grabbed his camera and snapped away. \nThe British photographer won the first hearing in California but PETA then appealed to a higher court. \nThe case was settled in September -- before that court could make a ruling -- with Slater agreeing to donate 25 percent of any future revenue from using or selling the monkey selfies to help protect the habitat of crested macaques in Indonesia. \nAuthorities and activists have been trying to persuade villagers on Sulawesi to stop consuming the critically endangered monkeys, one of many creatures that form part of the local indigenous community's diet.

However, this enthusiasm is neither shared by chancellor Merkel nor the wider German public.\" \n- 'Nothing is automatic' - \nGiven the rocky path ahead, Germany is \"unlikely to have a new government before spring\", which begins in March, predicted the SPD's Olaf Scholz, mayor of the northern city-state of Hamburg. \nBut he said he did not believe this spelled major problems or political instability for the country, given that a \"competent\" caretaker government of Merkel's conservatives and the SPD was in place. \nSchulz -- the election loser turned potential kingmaker -- has said he is in no rush to reach a deal, and that \"for us, nothing is predetermined, nothing is automatic\". \nHe has also vowed to extract maximum concessions for his over 150-year-old labour party, including social welfare gains and steps toward greater \"solidarity\" in Europe. \nThe SPD broadly supports French President Emmanuel Macron's sweeping vision for EU reform as well as a departure from Berlin's insistence on austerity in crisis-hit economies. \nSchulz has said he wants Berlin to assume \"a progressive, a more social, a more dynamic policy\". \nGerman Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, another SPD veteran, has also spoken out in favour of EU reform plans such as greater eurozone investment, a common finance minister and the creation of a European Monetary Fund. \nGermany had to consider the proposals from a broader perspective than how much they would cost, Gabriel told news weekly Der Spiegel, warning that inaction would be \"naive and dangerous for the European project\". \nSchulz, who is expected to be re-elected as party chief during the congress, became the SPD's top candidate a year ago when he won 100 percent party support in January and saw SPD poll ratings briefly shoot up some 10 percentage points. \nBut over the following months Schulz met the fate of Merkel's previous challengers, with his campaign -- built on fighting social inequality -- losing steam amid a string of regional poll defeats. \nIn the September general election, in which the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) protest party siphoned millions of votes from all mainstream parties, the SPD scored just under 21 percent, its worst showing since World War II. \nMost members felt that the past four years -- in which the SPD was Merkel's junior partner in the unhappy \"grand coalition\", or \"GroKo\" in German political shorthand -- had badly wounded party support and morale. \nThousands of members had already defected from the historical working-class champions when former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder slashed back the welfare state in the early 2000s. \nWhatever the outcome of any eventual talks with Merkel, it will have to satisfy the SPD party base, because members will ultimately vote to approve or scrap any coalition agreement.

He packed his camera and his dogs a his vintage burgundy car and left the home where he has lived for several years, its fate uncertain. \nUS media reported that the Bel-Air Moraga Estate of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, which contains a vineyard, was threatened by the wildfire. \nThe singer Lionel Richie cancelled a concert to help his ex-wife flee the area, while comedian Chelsea Handler and designer Adrienne Maloof were among celebrities tweeting that they had to evacuate. \nForecasters predicted that winds could cause fires to spread further, threatening more upscale homes and the acclaimed Getty Center museum. \nThe \"Skirball\" fire -- near a cultural center of the same name -- also prompted authorities to close the 405 Freeway, a major commuting corridor. \nResidents of wealthy LA neighborhoods between Mulholland Drive to the north and Sunset Boulevard to the south were part of the evacuation zone. \n- Flames menacing art - \nThe Getty arts institution -- home to masterpieces including those by Edouard Manet -- was closed until at least Thursday. Museum authorities tweeted that \"air filtration systems are protecting the galleries from smoke.\" \nThe prestigious University of California, Los Angeles is near the same area and also ended up evacuating, after students began the day wearing masks. \nDozens of schools were closed, as was Santa Monica College. \nJust north in Ventura County the \"Thomas\" blaze continued out of control, after erupting in the hills of oak and scrub north of Santa Paula, powered by strong seasonal guests known as Santa Ana winds. \n- State of emergency - \nAt least 4,000 firefighters were deployed across the entire fire zone, including on the scene of the \"Rye\" blaze -- which had grown to 7,000 acres in the Santa Clarita area -- as well as the \"Creek\" fire north of downtown Los Angeles that had grown to more than 11,000 acres. \nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency over the area on Tuesday. \nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said it had released funds for relief services. \nUS President Donald Trump tweeted a message of \"thoughts and prayers\" to California as it nears the end of its deadliest year ever for wildfires.

\nPassenger numbers have increased in recent years at Dakar's current airport in the middle of the city, leading to long waits at security and contributing to chronic traffic jams, and the old Leopold Sedar Senghor airport will become a military airfield from Friday. \nThe new airport boasts six footbridges direct to flight cabins, and will be able to service a range of aircraft including Airbus's massive A380s. \nWork was completed on the 4,500-hectare site -- with 2,000 hectares unused in case of required expansion -- by Turkish consortium Summa-Limak after a disagreement with Saudi Arabia's Bin Laden construction derailed the final stage of preparations. \nBut bets on whether Blaise Diagne would open on time have lasted until the last minute amid complaints by major European airlines over fuel capacity and regulations. \nSumma-Limak will now operate the airport for the next 25 years, furthering ever-closer economic ties between Ankara and Dakar. \nA train linking the airport with the city is not expected to open for years, leaving taxi drivers in pocket but ordinary travellers nervous of arriving on time for flights in a city with unpredictable traffic. \nBacked by loans from France's development agency the African Development Bank (ADB), the West African Development Bank (BOAD) and Islamic lender the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), officials are celebrating the airport's completion -- but the future of Senegal's new airline is less certain. \nAir Senegal still does not have all the licences required to begin commercial flights and has a fleet of just two ATR 72-600s, but Aviation Minister Maimouna Ndoye Seck said international ambitions for the airport meant a well-performing national airline was \"a necessity\". \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "senega", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "maimouna ndoye seck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahammed boun abdallah dionne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blaise diagne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macky sall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bin laden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leopold sedar senghor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdoulaye wade", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "airbus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aibd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "development bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic development bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blaise diagne international airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "african development bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boad", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "senegal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diamniadio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dakar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "air senegal", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:23:40.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb74a56856c17f14beb939f3ac3f58b642222fcb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXQUkzLCKgQKwcoKdDd8PL6MSTMvOvLKoAaAmYr36p6d0rjxGbnqJNGzQfGFO54k9aPGAZiPxZ88Jii_Z62ezlZqt_TUWtB7w-", "site_full": "stargazerslounge.com", "site": "stargazerslounge.com", "site_section": "https://stargazerslounge.com/forum/38-imaging-widefield-special-events-and-comets/", "site_categories": ["science", "space_astronomy"], "section_title": "Imaging -

We are Miami Beach, we are an arts and culture destination,\" said Mayor Dan Gelber. \nThe last edition of Art Basel, an annual event which also takes place in Switzerland and Hong Kong, brought 77,000 visitors to Miami Beach -- despite fears surrounding the Zika virus.
