Electro-diagnostics equipment are employed to study the electrical conduction or activity of muscle and nerve impulse. These devices help practitioners or physicians for their recommend diagnosis for patients such as myopathy, neuropathy, neuromuscular junction disorder, and plexopathy. Major electro-diagnostic study includes nerve conduction studies (NCS), somatosensory evoked potential studies (SSEPs), and electromyography (EMG). The study of nerve function is performed by NCS, which is done by the application of electrical impulses through electrodes placed on the skin. Electromyography is carried out by a small needle electrode which is inserted into various muscles of the body to reveal the status of the muscle\u2019s electrical activity.Report Overview and TOC @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/electro-diagnostics-ma\u2026 \nAdvancement in technology, safe electro-diagnostic devices with portable features, low power consumption, accuracy, and capacity to incorporate advanced diagnostic features are major drivers for growth of electro-diagnostic equipment\u2019s.

Faccenda has celebrated its second parternship anniversary with FareShare. \nThe chicken is redistributed by FareShare to over 100 frontline charities and community groups throughout the West Midlands, including homeless shelters, lunch clubs for older people at risk of social isolation and community centres in deprived areas. \nReceiving a regular delivery of chicken enables these charities to provide a source of protein for their beneficiaries, many of whom are malnourished or otherwise unable to access fresh meat. \nThe regularity of Faccenda\u2019s donations also means that FareShare\u2019s charity members can plan their meals around a reliable supply of fresh protein. \nAndy Dawkins, managing director of Faccenda, commented: \u201cWorking with FareShare has really made us think again about the value of the food we produce and the power it has to improve the lives of people in need. \n\u201cWe\u2019re all incredibly proud to support FareShare and the fantastic work they do, and look forward to continuing this for a long time to come.\u201d \nLindsay Boswell, CEO of FareShare, added: \u201cAs the first major poultry processor to consistently deliver chicken to FareShare week in week out, the impact of our partnership has been transformative. \n\u201cA regular supply of meat to our frontline charity members helps them provide nutritious meals for those in need and makes it easier for them to deliver services which lift people out of poverty and hunger long term.

Ireland's Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar looks on at a news conference at Government Buildings in Dublin, Ireland December 6, 2017. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne Varadkar has played a key role in negotiations over Britain\u2019s withdrawl from the European Union this week, insisting that a tentative deal struck on the Irish border on Monday must be fulfilled if talks are to move onto the next phase, as London wants. That was in sharp contrast to a week earlier when his deputy prime minister had to resign to avert a government collapse and election before Christmas, an episode that members of Fine Gael feared would damage both the party and its leader. Yet support for Fine Gael rose by five points to 36 percent in the Irish Times/MRBI poll, while fellow centre-right rival Fianna Fail has fallen four points to 25 percent since October. The left-wing Sinn Fein party was unchanged on 19 percent. The most recent survey taken by another polling company, conducted during the government crisis, showed that the two main parties were almost neck and neck. The number of undecided voters was far higher in the MRBI sample. Satisfaction with the government also rose by five points to 41 percent in Thursday\u2019s poll, the highest level achieved by any government in almost a decade. \u201cToday\u2019s poll proves that timing is everything,\u201d said MRBI director Aisling Corcoran. \u201cInterviewing took place on Monday and Tuesday against the backdrop of Brexit negotiations and the government has been credited with approaching the negotiations with clarity and determination.\u201d Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Angus MacSwan 0 : 0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leo varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aisling corcoran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters/clodagh kilcoyne varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angus macswan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "padraic halpin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "government buildings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters staff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irish times/mrbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sinn fein", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:17.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f4f6f30ebde6faea77530f2de80f9f071e6f6054", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBIgixUobzcGq9jV8NDXt_OTzVL2IdW9VsKUEPHXG1pf.SHKuE3WOC8jkU8ePf_rMvMsNI2MdLXQrB", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/share-chat.asp?page=80", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Share Chat on London South East.

Often, this \u201cbusiness planning\u201d is a complicated mess that leaves many frustrated. \nMany businesses will end up with a list of unrealistic goals and a lofty mission statement that looks great on paper but has no sustainable framework. \nInspired by the blogger challenge, 18 things to do before 2018, here\u2019s our real estate-themed to-do list for you. 18 things to do before 2018 Let go. Check out a book or two on the minimalist movement. You may not end up with a perfect office, but you could end up deleting a significant chunk of \u201cXYZ\u201d and free up some space for new opportunities to come into your life . Take a look at where you spent your money in 2017 . Identify unnecessary paid services, and eliminate them. Make sure all your tech devices are virus free and backed up. Read or listen to one book that will give you pause and keep you hustling during the holiday break. Send thank you cards , not just holiday cards, to everyone who helps you keep the lights on. Bite the bullet, and invest in paid cloud storage for your files instead of fighting the battle of storage on your smartphone . Forget inbox zero. Take it one day, one week at a time. You are only human. Make sure the time zone is correct on your digital calendars and that they are syncing. Choose one charity that you will support in 2018. Grab a physical. No one should be tired all the time. Make your health a priority. Meditate , pray, sit in a bookstore or the park, or enjoy your own company on a regular basis. You know what works for you. Google yourself. Make adjustments, and then set up a Google Alert . Clean out your LinkedIn Connections. The only people you should be connected with are those who would potentially send you business .

That is not to say it won't have a short term impact.\nMy reasoning is the Sp (for psn and bdev also) is driven by the divis. Sp = 20 * tot of FinDiv and SpDiv which, some time ago, I figured out was 240 for tw (ignoring assumed 3 pps IntDiv). This is the price tw will reach just before XDivDt as FatCats buy the Divi. What happens to the price on the way to 240 is irrelevant (20% increase).\nHi Tom\nHope you follow my reasoning, and just to contradict myself I think the Sp will fall if no Brexit deal, so probably a good idea to be in cash, to buy back hopefully at low point. Have a look at Sp graph at time of Brexit vote - low point about 3 weeks after the vote.\nThe converse is if there suddenly is a deal, the Sp will probably increase which you will have missed if you are in cash. Having said all that I got the Brexit vote totally wrong so maybe I'm talking rubbish again.\nBoL", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:17.067+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7f68656818b7d6c244fb8aa341e15cbca6bc3d41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPcnDX4iGTzV.ehWaekheqgtgI5oLMDHEPWqABmjOogOzqYjv5PIcNRk7SH6XlAv8g7WxFWCDBFVviKMlqEtcfv77Q9cbheoi_8LGyDkzAXQ7O5PPjJITnRg--", "site_full": "www.military-technologies.net", "site": "military-technologies.net", "site_section": "http://www.military-technologies.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["table_tennis_ping_pong", "financial_news", "finance", "sports"], "section_title": "MilTech", "title": "Pasteurizer Market Report \u2013 Global Industry Product Analysis, Business Overview by 2022", "title_full": "Pasteurizer Market Report \u2013 Global Industry Product Analysis, Business Overview by 2022", "published": "2017-12-07T10:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7f68656818b7d6c244fb8aa341e15cbca6bc3d41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhPcnDX4iGTzV.ehWaekheqgtgI5oLMDHEPWqABmjOogOzqYjv5PIcNRk7SH6XlAv8g7WxFWCDBFVviKMlqEtcfv77Q9cbheoi_8LGyDkzAXQ7O5PPjJITnRg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sagar G", "published": "2017-12-07T10:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "Pasteurizer Market Report \u2013 Global Industry Product Analysis, Business Overview by 2022", "text": "Major applications are as follows: Dairy Industry Food Industry For customisation in report, Ask Our Experts https://www.absolutereports.com/enquiry/pre-order-enquiry/11203851 \nGeographically, this report is segmented into several key Regions, with production, consumption, revenue (million USD), and market share and growth rate of Storage Area Network Switch in these regions, from 2012 to 2022 (forecast), covering North America, Europe, China, Japan, Southeast Asia, India and Others By providing the above mentioned key elements on the Industry status of the Pasteurizer Market this report is a valuable source of guidance and direction for companies and individuals interested in the industry.

The update also fixes screen sharing server to omit access to any root files. This comes as an extension to the recent security update that addressed the root vulnerability that was spotted on Mac devices with macOS High Sierra 10.13 and 10.13.1. The vulnerability, as publicised on Twitter last week, was allowing root access to people by typing the word \"root\" as a username when the machine prompts for security credentials on the login screen. \nYou can download the macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 directly from Mac App Store .

Image Supplied by Samsung \nSamsung Electronics Co. Ltd., introduced three Gear devices to its industry pioneering wearable portfolio. The Gear Sport, a sleek and versatile fitness-focused smartwatch that is water resistant; the Gear Fit2 Pro, an upgraded GPS sports band with smart features; and the Gear IconX, a second generation of the company\u2019s cord-free earbuds, now form part of the company\u2019s innovative offering. \nThe new devices assist with a range of activities across robust fitness tracking to nutrition and sleep monitoring, as well as motivational coaching as a lifestyle companion. Through the introduction of new smart capabilities, easy-to-use features and by partnering with leading names in technology and fitness, Samsung is enabling consumers to go beyond fitness, to accomplish even bigger things. \n\n\u201cSamsung has a long history of innovating technologies that meet consumers goals and aspirations. Whether you are going for a jog or training for a triathlon, Samsung\u2019s wearables are designed with everyday athletes, of varying fitness levels, in mind. Our wearables defy the stereotype that being fit requires spending copious amounts of time in the gym with fitness trackers that are complex and only compatible with the most intense workouts. Rather, the new Samsung Gear wearables enable consumers of all shapes and sizes to \u2018go beyond fitness\u2019 to enjoy an active, balanced and fulfilled life in a smart and seamless way,\u201d said Justin Hume, Chief Marketing Officer at Samsung South Africa. \n\nAs part of this updated line-up, Samsung created new capabilities for Gear Sport and Gear Fit2 Pro: Industry-Leading Water Resistance and Swim Tracking: An ideal companion for any swimming activity - from laps to playing in the pool - these devices are 5 ATM [1] certified for water resistance. Now with Speedo\u2019s latest swimming training app, Speedo On, the Gear Sport and Gear Fit2 Pro also allow consumers to easily track key swim metrics including lap count, lap time, stroke type and more. Top-of-the-line Heart Rate Monitoring: With improved accuracy, the devices offer advanced real-time heart rate monitoring. They help consumers to continuously monitor heart activity such as while enjoying an invigorating cycling class. Premium Partnerships: Daily activity can be supplemented with updated Under Armour and Spotify partnerships. Both devices provide access to Under Armour\u2019s fitness apps including Under Armour Record \u2122 , MyFitnessPal \u00ae , MapMyRun \u00ae and Endomondo \u2122 [2] for activity, nutrition, sleep and fitness tracking functions \u2013 these apps provide users with a holistic picture of their health and fitness. Spotify\u2019s Offline mode lets users listen to their favourite music online, offline or even without a smartphone so they can enjoy their favourite tunes regardless of location. Auto Activity Detection: Automatic activity detection built into the devices are in tune with the body and can recognise the following categories of activities: Walking, Running, Cycling and performing Dynamic Activities that could include dancing to basketball. Personalised Motivation: Consumers can customise a wellness plan with tailored goals and alerts. \n\nGear Sport: A new versatile smartwatch to support an active and balanced lifestyle \nGear Sport is stylish, yet practical with a minimalistic, circular bezel, Super AMOLED 1.2-inch display and improved user interface that makes it easy to view information, even when on-the-go. With Gear Sport, users can work to achieve health and wellness goals, and receive nutrition management alerts and activity recommendations even when they are offline. \nDesigned with military-level durability, it can handle a wide-range of environments. [3] With its sleek, ergonomic form, it can be worn in a variety of colourful and easily changeable standard 20mm straps, and it is perfect for any occasion so you can effortlessly transition from the gym to a night out with friends. Gear Sport is available in blue and black and also includes Gear foundational functions to: Control Samsung IoT-enabled devices through Samsung Connect Act as a remote control, whether for a PowerPoint presentation or Samsung Gear VR headset Pay for goods with a flick of the wrist via Samsung Pay (NFC Only) [4] \nThe Gear Sport will only be available in South Africa during the course of October. \nGear Fit2 Pro: An advanced GPS fitness band \nIn addition to new swim and heart rate monitoring capabilities, the new Gear Fit2 Pro features advanced built-in GPS tracking to capture a run or ride with accurate activity tracking. Gear Fit2 Pro\u2019s Super AMOLED curved 1.5-inch display and a high-resolution colour touchscreen make real-time updates and notifications easier to read. The all-new secure, ergonomic band is light weight and comfortable to use for all activities. Available in black and red, its versatile design also makes it a stylish accessory. \nGear IconX: Comfortable fit, cord-free earbuds \nIconX cord-free earbuds enables consumers to effortlessly listen to their favourite music \u2013 making the daily commute more enjoyable or helping to get more from a workout. Music can be enjoyed on and offline by transferring songs from a Samsung smartphone [5] or PC, or accessing tunes through Bluetooth connectivity. The earbuds are also the newest connection to Bixby. [6] With a simple tap and hold of the earbud consumers can use their voice to control music or the phone \u2013 without even having to hold it. \nThe updated design comes in black, grey and pink and is more ergonomic and lightweight so they are effectively secure, comfortable and stylish to use. For the fitness enthusiast, the Gear IconX automatically tracks running routines, and also features the standalone Running Coach function which can be activated by simply tapping the earbud to provide in-ear audio [7] exercise status updates \u2013 in real-time and without a phone.

Once they do, they\u2019re able to listen to and communicate with the child through a microphone in the toy. A familiar story \nInternet of Things (IoT) technology has revolutionised the toy industry, with speech recognition software replacing simulated digestive systems as the must-have gadgetry for dolls. Although toymakers have always been concerned about children\u2019s safety, they\u2019ve historically focused on issues such as whether the toys were a choke hazard or could give children lead poisoning. Cyber security is a very different challenge, one that many manufacturers have failed to address. \nIn November 2017, Consumer magazine Which? tested seven toys and found cyber security vulnerabilities in four of them: the Furby Connect, i-Que Intelligent Robot, Toy-Fi Teddy and CloudPets. \nIn a press release, Which? said : \u201cIn each of the toys the Bluetooth connection had not been secured, meaning during the tests our hacker didn\u2019t need a password, PIN code or any other authentication to get access. In addition, very little technical know-how was needed to gain access to the toys to start sharing messages with a child.\u201d \nUsing an existing hack, Which? was able to get the Furby to play audio files and manipulate the graphics in the toy\u2019s eyes. It couldn\u2019t turn the Furby into a listening device, but it \u201cbelieves this is possible if someone was able to re-engineer its firmware\u201d. \nThe Toy-Fi Teddy and CloudPets toys had the same vulnerabilities as My Friend Cayla, with the researchers at Which? able to play voice messages through the toys and listen to children\u2019s responses. \nThe vulnerability in the CloudPets toy was exposed in February 2017 by Paul Stone, a security researcher. More than 800,000 customer records and 2 million audio recordings were left on a database that was neither password-protected nor behind a firewall, allowing malicious parties to repeatedly access the data and ransoming the company. \nSpiral Toys, the manufacturer of CloudPets, tried to downplay the vulnerability. However, the share price of the foundering toymaker plummeted in the following months, and the company was ridiculed on social media, particularly after one Twitter user photographed dozens of CloudPets products on sale at a discount shop. Haha. All the compromised #cloudpets at the 99 cent store. I like how they covered the name with a sticker hoping nobody notices. pic.twitter.com/Bb2OLeTscn \n\u2014 Alex von Gluck \uf342 (@kallisti5) 20 March 2017 Security in the digital world \nSmart toys will no doubt be at the top of many children\u2019s Christmas wish lists, so security concerns leave parents and guardians in a tricky position. It\u2019s hard to explain to your kids that Cayla isn\u2019t their friend, but an \u201cillegal espionage apparatus\u201d , but it\u2019s not as if any other smart toy should fill anyone with confidence. \nToys are a hot-button security issue because they affect the privacy of children, but the digitalisation of our everyday lives has created security vulnerabilities everywhere. Our December book of the month, Security in the Digital World , shows the extent of the problem and offers advice on how to navigate these threats. \nThis guide gives up-to-date information on consumer risks, providing you with: An understanding and awareness of information security and cyber threats; Explanations of what social engineering is and techniques used by cyber criminals; Advice on what to look out for online and your rights as a consumer; Guidance on common threats in the digital age, including malware, social engineering and ransomware; and Ten tips to keep your digital information secure.

Likewise, a former employee at OCS Group UK was jailed for sending confidential data to his personal email account, breaking the terms of a court order. Different opinions \nThere are conflicting opinions when it comes to determining the causes of corporate data theft. \nLeah Waller, head of employment at Lennons, said : With technology advancing at an incredible speed, and the majority of information now being stored electronically with easy access, the instances of employees, especially those that leave on bad terms, taking confidential information is likely to continue to increase and as such the number of claims in the High Court will continue to rise. \nDavid Emm, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, said: Employees rank at the very top of the list of threats to data and systems. Their motivations are often hard to predict and anticipate, ranging from a desire for financial gain to disaffection, coercion and simple carelessness. When insider-assisted attacks do occur, the impact of such attacks can be devastating as they provide a direct route to the most valuable information \u2013 customer data. \nEmm recommends staff education as part of a wider plan to reduce the likelihood of future threats. Staff education \nAlthough it is clear that the problem is a growing concern for many organisations, it is unclear whether employees are fully aware of the risks. \nWhen dealing with confidential and sensitive corporate information, employees need to be aware of internal security policies and procedures, as well as information security best practice. \nOur Information Security Staff Awareness E-Learning Course aims to familiarise staff with information security policies and procedures, and help employees understand the organisation\u2019s information and compliance risks.

Basically, starting with the Apple Store app version 4.4, Apple customers can buy an iPhone X without going through the pre-authorization process, but instead have the activation performed at a later time, thus saving time when trying to complete a purchase. This is a method that was introduced by Apple on its official website for the launch of the iPhone X, and is now being implemented in the official app for AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint in the United States. The same new version also introduces improvements for iOS 11, and this is undoubtedly a welcome refinement given how buggy this operating system version has proved to be so far. Many criticized iOS 11 for its poor performance, battery drain, and app crashes, and updates like these should make things a little bit better at least for those who want to purchase new devices using just their iPhones. New scanner for credit cards And last but not least, the latest Apple Store app update includes a revised scanner that makes it easier to add new credit card information. Instead of having to type the credit card details, the scanner can now fill in the form all automatically by simply using the phone\u2019s camera to scan the card. This way, the checkout is completed faster without the hassle of writing down all information manually. It goes without saying that this update would have come in a lot handier if it was released before October 27 when iPhone X went up on pre-order and customers needed a faster way to purchase the devices, but it\u2019s still a welcome improvement for future models. You can find the new version of the app in the Apple Store , and it requires iOS 10 or later, with support for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "apple store", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "verizon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sprint", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "at&t", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:20.033+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37097f08389af92ebead9faaa1387a02800eb0a4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzuW0Up1GA78hY1rCz1aAuFGOtfAfBB.Zne8aEuEK7bGuCZxCKYIQaNR.JADbNtDEJbb1YGJPYT9ALFXxfqvb3MnlY56FKgYiZ5ycc.3sZrufxJ345QbjM6D_LMEswv5tn4rYH3w_ShXUuB8LWMaClpjAwCAWowfQw-", "site_full": "forums.hardwarezone.com.sg", "site": "hardwarezone.com.sg", "site_section": "http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/english-premier-league-179/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "English Premier League - www.hardwarezone.com.sg", "title": "Manchester United - Theatre of Dreams - Part 31 355", "title_full": "Manchester United - Theatre of Dreams - Part 31 - Page 355 - www.hardwarezone.com.sg", "published": "2017-12-06T15:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/img/sg/hwz-og-logo-big.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5181, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9e0add0ac131213a8c8719673c7213eacde4ea7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzuW0Up1GA78hY1rCz1aAuFGOtfAfBB.Zne8aEuEK7bGuCZxCKYIQaNR.JADbNtDEJbb1YGJPYT9ALFXxfqvb3MnlY56FKgYiZ5ycc.3sZrufxJ345QbjM6D_LMEswv5tn4rYH3w_ShXUuB8LWMaClpLi4ru7Z6Ub1NAwYsSAWLvA--", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "jahtl62", "published": "2017-12-07T10:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : 'It doesn't matter who you get in the draw,' he added.

You can\u2019t fake this. We can preach and lead and serve: all of this can be faked. But if we\u2019re not ourselves satisfied with the goodness of God, then we\u2019ve got nothing to offer. We\u2019re just going through the motions.\nOne of our primary responsibilities, then, is to feast on God\u2019s goodness. We must ourselves know God\u2019s heart for us if we have anything to offer to the world.\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so drawn to the opening words of The Heart of Christ by Thomas Goodwin. I read them often because I forget that they\u2019re true. Read them. Feast on them, not for others but for you.\nHaving set forth our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ \u2026 I shall now annex this discourse that follows, which lays open the heart of Christ, as he is now in heaven, sitting at God\u2019s right hand and interceding for us; how it is affected and graciously disposed towards sinners on earth that do come to him; how willing to receive them; how ready to entertain them; how tender to pity them in all their infirmities, both sins and miseries\u2026\nGoodwin goes on, but there\u2019s enough in this paragraph to feed on for days.\nPastor: Preach this to yourself before you preach it to others. Satisfy yourself with his goodness. Lead yourself to Christ\u2019s heart so that you can lead others. If you\u2019re preaching this Sunday, aim to lead people here, but get there yourself first. He is graciously disposed to us. He is tender toward us. Preach it. Soak in it. Breathe it in. I don\u2019t believe it nearly enough, but to the extent that I do, it makes all the difference in the world.\nThe post The Heart of Christ appeared first on DashHouse .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "goodwin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus christ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas goodwin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christ", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:21.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe86fe6e3296ec575aaf57060855d4c983e4869d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRvpXJy2123Odaf5kq4VR1KnxNcEJihs8kpeY4cW7dFIyNNTKNaRqWLKIHPmmDpvJ2sVjo0jA8vn_z0nU7dHWaqy32rhTsyMXY-", "site_full": "pclee441.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://pclee441.wordpress.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Speed Handicap Horse Racing", "title": "Speed Form Sun 10 Dec 2017 \u2013 Sha Tin", "title_full": "Speed Form Sun 10 Dec 2017 \u2013 Sha Tin", "published": "2017-12-07T12:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/e53fea02c384fd6dcf9a1e4a368102fb?s=200&amp;ts=1512641778", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fe86fe6e3296ec575aaf57060855d4c983e4869d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRvpXJy2123Odaf5kq4VR1KnxNcEJihs8kpeY4cW7dFIyNNTKNaRqWLKIHPmmDpvJ2sVjo0jA8vn_z0nU7dHWaqy32rhTsyMXY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "pclee441", "published": "2017-12-07T12:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Speed Form Sun 10 Dec 2017 \u2013 Sha Tin", "text": "Speed Handicap Horse Racing The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but that\u2019s the way to bet.

I want them to acknowledge that they were wrong,\" Eric Andersson told Swedish national broadcaster SVT .

However, his plans were thwarted as Eric, who at that time weighed 159 kilograms, was told that he would never complete the course in self-defence unless he drastically lost weight. \"It felt pretty s*itty, having it rubbed in your face that you are overweight. And it's always fun to hear this sort of thing from your boss,\" Andersson explained sardonically. He added that he was told that being heavy was actually an advantage, as it roused respect among inmates. \nBy his own admission, Andersson later received an apology from the criminal care and an offer of SEK 10,000 ($1,200) in damages, but refused to accept it. \"I and the trade union have agreed that SEK 150,000 is reasonable.

In China, KKR is investing about $1 billion a year in equity, and is seeing opportunities in industries including food safety, environment and consumer finance, Kravis said.\nMore details in https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/...-long-time Specuvestor: Asset - Business - Structure.\nhttp://www.valuebuddies.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-07/kkr-s-henry-kravis-says-china-bull-run-can-go-for-a-long-time"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:21.034+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "abb5f363d9d42c978cd0888374b4f27d703552bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw37pM0ts6wo4wks9yqTFoNwVlMVC.AtiRR4OYU_gJ45gXR9Mt0pmNkSrxHiBHatAe_Z2D6SbpVZ93gnb9w8pMt8Ft_5UmULn.gLjUuCkUkPY289m6GKiTH9Wwq1bOgGOlb2UHloLrbw--", "site_full": "www.gumtree.com.au", "site": "gumtree.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-miscellaneous-goods/c18319", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "tech"], "section_title": "Miscellaneous Goods | Gumtree Australia Free Local Classifieds", "title": "Japanese Step Cupboard (Tansu) Yarra Ranges - East Warburton | 1168130278", "title_full": "Japanese Step Cupboard (Tansu) | Miscellaneous Goods | Gumtree Australia Yarra Ranges - East Warburton | 1168130278", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.981, "main_image": "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxNDg2/z/yFkAAOSwpvZaKQd9/$_58.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1188, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "abb5f363d9d42c978cd0888374b4f27d703552bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw37pM0ts6wo4wks9yqTFoNwVlMVC.AtiRR4OYU_gJ45gXR9Mt0pmNkSrxHiBHatAe_Z2D6SbpVZ93gnb9w8pMt8Ft_5UmULn.gLjUuCkUkPY289m6GKiTH9Wwq1bOgGOlb2UHloLrbw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ursula", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Japanese Step Cupboard (Tansu) Yarra Ranges - East Warburton | 1168130278", "text": "This 4 tier cherry/rose wood finish cabinet is in exellent condition.

Subscribe 24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter! Back to Article news With the buzz created by the hashtag #EndSARS yet to die down, a police officer in Delta State has reportedly shot an 18-year-old female student , Sophia Ogogo, at a checkpoint over a bribe of N1,000. Punch reports that the officer identified as Sergeant Abua , attached to the Ibusa Division Police Division, is currently on the run just as the police have been doing everything to cover up the crime. It was gathered that Sergeant Abua and other officers had mounted a checkpoint in the community when a Toyota Corolla driven by one Jerry Akinlabi, an estate agent, carrying the victim, a student at the Delta State Polytechnic, and a civil servant, Victor Emeagwai, was flagged down by the team of five policemen including Sergeant Abua, at a checkpoint along Igbuzo Market. One of the policemen identified as Nwokolo, was said to have demanded money from Akinlabi who told him he had he did not have N200 to give him but Nwokolo reportedly insisted on taking one of the N1,000 notes Akinlabi had on him. But Akinlabi who did not want to part with the N1,000 drove off from the checkpoint, Sergeant Abua was said to have shot at the car and the bullets pierced the back of the vehicle, hitting Ogogo, who sat at the back seat, as well as Emeagwai who was at the passenger\u2019s seat. Realising what he had done, Sergeant Abua was said to have dropped his gun and took to his heels. Narrating how the incident happened, Akinlabi said: \u201cOn Sunday, November 17, 2017, I was driving to the Ibuza Market and on getting to a checkpoint, I met the policemen. We knew one another some months ago when I had an issue concerning a property at the station. I sounded the horn to greet them but they did not respond. One of them used his gun to hit the boot and I reversed. He said I wanted to beat the checkpoint. I told him that I assumed that they knew me very well and apologised. He demanded money. I wanted to give him N100 or N200, but it was N1,000 notes I had on me and I explained to him. He said, \u2018Am I too small to collect N1,000?\u2019 When I declined to give him N1,000, he asked me to pull over, which I did. As the argument over N1,000 got heated, I entered my car and drove off. What I heard next were three gunshots aimed at my car. A bullet pierced the car, hit my girlfriend\u2019s body, came out and hit my friend in the back.\u201d Akinlabi said he called a senior police officer at Asaba who notified the State Commissioner of Police of the incident. \u201cThe CP and the DPO of the Ibusa Police Station came to the FMC where I had taken the victims to and deposited N100,000, but I had spent much more than that. Meanwhile, the policeman who shot at us had gone to drop the gun at the station and fled. The other four policemen were detained at the command headquarters. My friend and I wrote our statements there.\u201d Akinlabi further explained that a police officer asked him to drop his car key to aid the investigation, adding that he handed over the car key but activated the steering lock because he suspected foul play. \"I went to meet with the Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Zone 5, Benin, Edo State, who assigned a policeman to take my statement. As I was returning from Zone 5 on Monday, I received a call from the Investigating Police Officer at the police headquarters in Asaba and he asked for the steering key. The IPO and a policeman came down to the hospital and I told them I would have to look for the key when I got home. The policeman sent from Zone 5 invited my friend to the police headquarters in Asaba to write his statement too. When he got there, he saw some policemen moving the car. He called to ask me if I gave them the key to unlocking the steering and I said no. When I called the IPO, he confirmed what my friend said and he told me that there was no cause for alarm.\u201d Akinlabi said when his car was returned, the policemen had washed it, cleaning the blood while the with the bullet holes in the vehicle were covered and painted. A human rights activist and the Coordinator of Behind Bars, Prince Harrison Gwamnishu, who was contacted by Akinlabi contacted on the matter, said the group would institute a legal action against the police. \u201cWe want to charge the case to court as a civil matter. It is barbaric. Why did the police wash the bloodstains in the car and covered the bullet holes without the consent of the owner? In their efforts to destroy evidence, they washed the car of the blood stains not knowing pictures of the car had already been taken. The other officers who carried out the attempted murder of Sophia are currently in detention Zone 5 Benin led by ASP Akhabue Easter while one of them Sergeant Abua is still on the run. Why will the Nigeria Police (Delta State Command) destroy evidence? Where is Sergeant Abua? Our lawyers will be doing the needful to see that all the officers involved in the attempted murder of Jerry Akinlabi, Victor Emeagwai, Sophia Ogogo are brought to book and pay dearly for it.\" ALSO READ : \"Lawless: Police officer shoots driver to death over bribe in Ogun\" Commenting on the issue, the State Police Public Relations Officer [PPRO], DSP Andrew Aniamaka , said the policemen would be brought to book if found culpable after the investigation. \u201cThe case is being investigated. However, our utmost concern is that the injured victim gets proper treatment. The Area Commander and the DPO of the Division in question are involved in the matter. The case is being investigated by Zone 5. Where somebody is absent from duty for 21 days without any reason, we declare such a person a deserter. So, there is no anxiety that the policeman is on the run. Be Rest assured that the right thing will be done.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emeagwai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harrison gwamnishu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sophia ogogo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry akinlabi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nwokolo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victor emeagwai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew aniamaka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sophia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akinlabi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edo state", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "delta", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "n1k", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ibusa police station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delta state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibusa division police division", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fmc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delta state command", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "benin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ogun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delta state polytechnic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ogogo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "igbuzo market", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:22.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "55985f6a565b1f07e61b126f76dec87401842a9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9tj.R1dPVNZf.dv7vkCN_Uxs4dmIbG4WoSCrrZGnRDcLWnz.m_UU5UK5kwoHUpBv8M3WRESDNmoSIfgLh9P7c8UhHU4gOfkBkb2_FJ8IIC2n8M0De.elsR", "site_full": "www.complaintsboard.com", "site": "complaintsboard.com", "site_section": "http://www.complaintsboard.com/lastcompanieslist/", "site_categories": ["media", "shopping"], "section_title": "Complaints Board - Consumer Complaints, Reviews, Information | Last Companies", "title": "Boardwalk Buy - my order hasn't arrived yet, 949955", "title_full": "Boardwalk Buy - my order hasn't arrived yet, Review 949955 | Complaints Board", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "https://www.complaintsboard.com/thumb.php?src=boardwalk-buy.png&wmax=200&ahmax=200&quality=90&crop=1&bname=120988", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "55985f6a565b1f07e61b126f76dec87401842a9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9tj.R1dPVNZf.dv7vkCN_Uxs4dmIbG4WoSCrrZGnRDcLWnz.m_UU5UK5kwoHUpBv8M3WRESDNmoSIfgLh9P7c8UhHU4gOfkBkb2_FJ8IIC2n8M0De.elsR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sophie I44", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Boardwalk Buy - my order hasn't arrived yet, 949955", "text": "I ordered Cat Headphones for 30 dollars.\nEverything went well, nothing boded trouble.
