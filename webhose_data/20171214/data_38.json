For me, it\u2019s the day everything pumpkin spice magically turns to gingerbread. \nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m always sad to bid pumpkin season adieu. But I\u2019d be lying if I said gingerbread didn\u2019t help cushion the blow. Once pumpkin spice has its grand finale on Thanksgiving, I quickly adjust my seasonal palette to all things gingerbread all the time. \nAside from some peppermint and eggnog fans, gingerbread is really the star of the show this season. From cookies and lattes to decorations and arts and crafts, gingerbread is a timeless holiday staple. And while gingerbread has a pretty consistent flavor, its many different forms vary considerably. OUR LATEST VIDEOS \nOddly enough, gingerbread\u2019s most recognizable form isn\u2019t really bread at all. When I think gingerbread, I usually think cookies. This gingerbread cake recipe brings gingerbread closer to its namesake. A delicious, moist quick bread, this gingerbread cake is a holiday baking must have. \nBecause this gingerbread cake is really more of a quick bread (but think about it, we couldn\u2019t really call it \u201cgingerbread bread,\u201d could we?) it\u2019s super versatile. Sweet, rich, and delicious, this recipe makes a delicious addition to your holiday dessert bar. However, like pumpkin bread or banana bread, this gingerbread recipe also makes a great morning treat. \nAnd now for the best part. Whether you\u2019re enjoying this gingerbread with a glass of eggnog after dinner or with a matching latte in the morning, you can indulge in these seasonal flavors guilt free. This gingerbread cake substitutes common baking ingredients for clean ones, giving you a healthier version of the seasonal sweet. \nThis recipe uses whole wheat flour, coconut oil, coconut milk, and Greek yogurt for a rich, clean cake. Meanwhile, this gingerbread cake gets its rich, natural sweetness from molasses and pure maple syrup. Plenty of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves round out the signature warm, spicy gingerbread flavor. \nTo make this recipe, start by combining the dry ingredients and spices in a medium bowl. In a mixing bowl, combine the wet ingredients before gradually incorporating the flour mixture. Just pour into a loaf pan prepared with nonstick spray and bake 40 minutes at 350! \nThis rich gingerbread cake is delicious sliced and served all on its own, or topped with a glaze. Honey makes a delicious, naturally sweet topping for this recipe. However, this cake also pairs well with lots of flavors.

It does not matter if you choose to run or dance, both can work well to bring in the same effect. Moreover, they moderate the impact of diseases like blood sugars and high blood pressure.

Thus, to stay away from this, one has to find good ways of dealing with whatever comes their way. For instance, engaging in activities that you like helps to get yourself out from the stressing environment. Also, if your anxiety is as a result of poor timing or mismanagement, you have to curb this before you find yourself in the wrong.\n\nYou also have to take your medication as your doctor has prescribed them. Sometimes, skipping some medication is what develops more serious illness. Although it may not be comfortable taking medicine after every single hour, there is no shortcut if this is the only way to keep your body healthy. If you are likely to forget the prescriptions, you may develop a computer-generated sheet for your medical schedule.\n\nAnother important thing is avoiding skipping meals. Hunger causes the variation of blood sugars. As such, no matter how tempting it may be, one should never jump their meals. Besides, providing your brain with energy, foods are a source of vitamins and minerals which support the body immune system. Additionally, some meals are used to reduce the effect of some chronic conditions.\n\nRespect and create boundaries for your limits.

Experienced doctors have better answers for a particular illness.\n\nSometimes you will be in worse situations, and you will need some help. Find at least one or two persons who can understand you and are willing to support you. Also, show them what is expected of them when you are in difficulties.

The baby girl was a passenger in Sosa\u2019s car, but it was not made clear by police if they are related.\nSosa is a Honduran national and is in the country illegally, federal officials said. Undocumented immigrants are not allowed to have a driver\u2019s license in North Carolina. The city of Charlotte has been criticized in the past few years because city police will not ask the citizenship status of people caught driving in the city without a license. They are issued tickets but not arrested.\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Tuesday that Sosa was ordered to be removed from the United States by a federal immigration judge in September 2005.\nICE agents took custody of Sosa on Tuesday. She will be deported once the manslaughter case is resolved, officials said. The agency lists her name as Carmen Sosa-Bonilla.\nThe fatal crash occurred Nov. 29 in the 1500 block of North Graham Street when the Sosa\u2019s 2005 Toyota Corolla swerved into traffic to avoid hitting the back of a dump truck that had stopped on the road. Her vehicle struck a southbound Toyota Camry driven by 43-year-old David John Collins Jr. head-on, police said.\nMedic took the drivers and child to Carolinas Medical Center. The child was later pronounced dead, police said....\nAccording to Obama and Hillary, the federal government can drone strike Americans without due process.

Would you like to work in eye clinics and optical shops, as well as some ophthalmic treatment centers? \nTo have access to positions as optometrist requires a Bachelor\u2019s degree or Diploma in Optometry/ Doctor of Optometry, a minimum of three (3) years course duration; you also will need a minimum of two (2) years\u2019 experience post certification. \nOphthalmologists have specialized medical degrees and need to be Board Certified for the majority of the positions open to them. Several clinics look for candidates who are certified through foreign boards: American, Canadian, German Fachartz. \nBut what is the difference between Optometry and Ophthalmology? \nAn optometrist is a health care professional heavily involved in eye-and vision-care. They don\u2019t graduate from medical schools but have specialized degrees that allow them to perform comprehensive eye examination in order to detect and treat various visual abnormalities. An optometrist can recognize early signs of potential vision loss or disorders, prescribes glasses, and can help with care before and after surgery. \nAn ophthalmologist is a professional who has graduated from medical school and provides comprehensive care for eyes. This professional is not only able to detect eye diseases and abnormalities but can also treat all conditions affecting patients. Ophthalmologists can perform surgeries like Laser Assisted Cataract Surgery or Medical, Laser and Surgical Treatment of Glaucoma, and, in some cases, are even trained to perform minor plastic surgery interventions around the eyes to smooth wrinkles or correct eyelids. Corrective eye surgeries such as Lasik and Lasek/PRK offer quick, effective and life-changing results for people. \nIn addition to the requirements of their particular jobs and professional figures, optometrists and ophthalmologists, and all healthcare professionals in general, must hold an active DHA license as per the Professionals Qualification Requirements (PQR) and obviously work within their scope of practice. \nBe sure to keep up with new technology developments and provisions of optometry services through conventions. Events like the 2nd International Conference on Eye and Vision: December 06-07, 2017 | Dubai. World Eye and Vision Congress: September 06-08, 2018 | Dubai. Theme: The progressions of Ophthalmology and Vision Science. Those in attendance will come familiar with ways to Protect Your Eyes with vision correction through eyeglasses and contact lens prescriptions written by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Reduce Your Risk of Cataracts or Glaucoma by undergoing Ophthalmic surgeries which can be of various types which include laser eye surgery, cataract surgery, glaucoma surgery, etc. Improve You Vision with surgery performed on the eye or its adnexa, normally by an ophthalmologist.Opportunities might increase in the future, so be ready! \nThe Government of Abu Dhabi has allocated healthcare funding for the health of the eyes and has budgeted for VISION 2020 strategies\u2014 i.e. to eliminate the main causes of avoidable blindness by the year 2020. This means that more and more approved eye-care projects will be devised to increase prevention to include treatment activities and plans for training new optometrists. There\u2019s particular emphasis on integrating optometrists into primary eye care programs. \nOpportunities might increase in the future, so be ready!

He's a quality shooter.\n\"We've just got to do a better job of getting him good shots in the game.\n\"We know he can shoot and he has NBA range. Hopefully he'll take that form into the game.\"\nCotton's hot hand played a crucial role in Perth's surge to last season's championship.\nThis season, they boast a more even spread of scoring talent, highlighted by Jesse Wagstaff's heroics against NZ last week.\nWith Cotton restricted to just seven points for the match, Wagstaff nailed four three-pointers in the final term to lift the Wildcats to a 89-73 win in enemy territory.\nGleeson said the attention paid to Cotton meant other players have been freed up.\n\"Obviously he is a marked man from his performance last year in the championship,\" Gleeson said.\n\"Teams try to stop him. That creates other opportunities for other players.\n\"Jesse did a really good job last week.
