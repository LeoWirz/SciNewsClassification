The nonprofit organization in San Jose funds Silicon Valley health programs, from diabetes testing to Meals on Wheels and children\u2019s dental clinics.\n\nThe wells, planned for a five-acre lot at McLaughlin Avenue and Carnelian Drive, are scheduled to be finished by next summer, with the fluoride equipment installed and working by 2019.\n\nRoughly 64 percent of California residents receive fluoridated water. San Francisco has had it since 1951, Oakland since 1976, Los Angeles since 1999 and San Diego since 2011. Other parts of Santa Clara County, such as Palo Alto, which receives water from the Hetch Hetchy system, are fluoridated.\n\nA naturally occurring mineral, fluoride was first added to drinking water in Michigan in 1945 as a way to strengthen teeth and reduce cavities. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called it \u201cone of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century,\u201d citing studies that it reduces tooth decay by 25 percent.\n\nOn Tuesday, four people spoke in favor of the plan, and one against.\n\n\u201cFluoride is naturally occurring, but so is lead and arsenic,\u201d said Gary Wesley of Mountain View, a long-time fluoride opponent. \u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t want to take that. There\u2019s a better way to go and that is to invest your money in individualized care, through dental insurance.\u201d\n\nTodd Hansen, chief operating officer of the Health Trust, said his nonprofit group is helping fund fluoridation projects with a focus on East San Jose, rather than wealthier areas like Willow Glen.\n\n\u201cBad teeth can cause all sorts of other diseases, and it can have a big impact on kids \u2014 their ability to learn and their ability to eat healthy,\u201d Hansen said. The organization performs thousands of dental procedures every year for low-income children in the county, including 6,000 root canals a year for infants.\n\nOverall, the scope of the new project is somewhat limited. Although officials from the Health Trust and Chavez\u2019s office originally said it would serve 400,000 residents, officials from San Jose Water, which owns the pipes and sends the bills to customers, said the actual number is 75,000 people, or about 7 percent of its 1 million customers, according to Jayme Ackemann, a spokeswoman for San Jose Water.\n\nHansen said the Health Trust will continue raising money to expand fluoride to other wells in the years ahead, a strategy supported by Santa Clara County Health Officer Sara Cody, the California Dental Association, Silicon Valley Leadership Group and others.\n\nOverall, San Jose Water has 108 wells at 27 locations in Santa Clara County, and the six wells at the new site at McLaughlin Avenue will be the first to have fluoride added.\n\nStudies by the Health Trust have concluded it would cost $23 million to connect fluoridation equipment to all 108 wells owned by San Jose Water, or $12 million for all the wells serving East San Jose.\n\nUnder a state law signed in 1995 by former Gov. Pete Wilson, water providers with more than 10,000 connections are required to add fluoride. But they were not mandated to pay for it, so they are only required when someone else puts up the money. Santa Clara County has set aside $4 million for fluoridation projects.\n\nThe reason that San Jose remains the largest U.S. city without broad fluoridation is largely due to San Jose Water. In 1964, San Jose voters approved adding fluoride to city water by a 59-41 percent margin. But San Jose Water, a for-profit company traded on the New York Stock Exchange, argued it shouldn\u2019t have to pay the costs. The state Public Utilities Commission, which regulates privately owned water companies, in 1969 closed the case and did not require the company to fluoridate.\n\nToday, San Jose Water provides water to 80 percent of San Jose\u2019s residents, along with Los Gatos, Saratoga, Monte Sereno, Campbell and parts of Cupertino. Roughly 40 of the company\u2019s supply comes from unfluoridated groundwater, 50 percent comes from water imported from the San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta and 10 percent comes from local reservoirs.\n\nFluoridation advocates won a major victory in 2011 when the Santa Clara Valley Water District, the county\u2019s water wholesaler, voted to add fluoride at its three drinking water treatment plants. The plants treat water from the Delta and sell it to San Jose Water and other retail providers. The first system went online last December at the Santa Teresa Plant, and for the past year has provided fluoridated water to 230,000 residents of in East San Jose, Almaden Valley and Santa Teresa who are customers of San Jose Water Company.\n\nWork at the two other treatment plants is expected to be completed by 2020. Then, another 520,000 people will receive fluoride, including residents of West San Jose, Cupertino, Saratoga and parts of Los Gatos.\n\nBut people who receive groundwater from San Jose Water Company have not had fluoride. As a result, in some areas, when that groundwater is blended with the Delta water from the Santa Clara Valley Water District, it has reduced levels of fluoride below the .7 parts per million recommended by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe new project at McLaughlin Avenue will begin to change that.\n\n\u201cThe addition of fluoride at these wells will allow us to maintain optimal levels of fluoride throughout the year for the residents who are receiving this water,\u201d said Ackemann.\n\nComments \nRod Johnson   \u2022   15 hours ago Mass poisoning. Welcome to America. The material added to drinking water is toxic waste. Not one shred of data can be supplied to prove it's safe. Quite to the contrary. According to multiple studies, fluoride is correlated with lower IQ. If you are not concerned about that, it literally might be the fluoride working.  https://www.huffingtonpost....   \u2022 Reply \u2022 Share \u203a \u2212 Steven Slott    Rod Johnson   \u2022   13 hours ago Rod 1. There is no \u201ctoxic waste\u201d involved with water fluoridation. 2. The only substances ingested as a result of fluoridation are fluoride ions, identical to those which humans have been ingesting in water since the beginning of time, and trace contaminants in amounts far below US EPA mandated maximum allowable levels of safety. There is no valid evidence that any of this is in any manner unsafe. There is therefore no reason for any \u201cshred\u201d of data on its safety. 3. None of the \u201cmultiple studies\u201d claiming correlation of fluoride to lower IQ, has any relevance to fluoride at the optimal level at which water is fluoridated. 4. There is no reason to be \u201cconcerned\u201d with baseless claims and speculation of antifluoridationists. Steven D.

But today I want us to talk about five things on your CV that are probably very irrelevant. \nThese are sections that are not adding any value to your CV but instead end up giving you a lengthy piece of document that fails to bring out the best in you. \nLet\u2019s find out. 5 things you should never have in your CV \n1. Your photo \nUnless you are applying for certain jobs such as modeling which often require a visual, kindly do not have a photo on your CV. \nWhat the recruiter wants to know is how well equipped you are to do the job not how handsome or beautiful you appear to be. \nFurthermore, adding your photo only eats up valuable space on your CV that could have been used to communicate your expertise instead. \n2. Inappropriate/unprofessional email addresses \nCreating an email is an exercise that is free and will take you no more than 5minutes. \nWith these perks some job seekers opt to create very unprofessional email addresses such as maggymresh@gmail.com , jimbabayao@hotmail.com, shirowamum@yahoo.com . \nSuch email addresses only show your lack of seriousness and unprofessionalism. \n3. Personal social media accounts \nCommunication has greatly changed in the advent of social media. \nWhile it is okay to include your LinkedIn page due to its professional nature, you need not start including everything else like your twitter handles, facebook page, Instagram, Snap chat, you-tube channel etc. \nThis will only make a recruiter start going through your profiles and perhaps stumble on something that will diminish your chances of being shortlisted. \n4. Grammatical errors and typos \nIt is very annoying for any recruiter to peruse pages of a CV that has not been proof-read. \nBefore sending out your CV, read it, re-read it and if possible give it to someone else to proof-read for you. \nHaving grammatical errors and typos show that you put little thought into your CV and hence the recruiter will not even look at it twice. \n5. Vague and ambiguous phrases \nIf you have the habit of indicating on your CV vague statements such as \u201chardworking\u201d, \u201ccompetent\u201d, \u201cmotivated\u201d etc., you are doing a great disservice to your CV. \nThese statements don\u2019t tell the employer much. What you need to do is offer a brief explanation or statement not cliche statements that every job seeker is using. \nA good example: \n\u201cI am a highly motivated individual who takes a personal initiative to ensure that the tasks assigned to me are completed and executed in due time.\u201d \nPiece of advice\u2026 \nThe amount of time and effort you put into your CV will reflect to any recruiter. \nIf you\u2019ve been churning out half-baked, error ridden CV\u2019s you will probably never get a call back for an interview. \nIf you require expert help on how to write the perfect CV, have a CV writing professional help you through that. \nSometimes the only barrier between you and your dream job is your CV! \nEsther Kamau works for Corporate Staffing Services, a leading HR firm that offers recruitment and FREE job placement. \nFor more information, visit their website on www.corporatestaffing.co.ke  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "esther kamau", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corporate staffing services", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:07.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "17d7ab2d58aedfee5380872b37116aa54c811cb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZidBlutdGeh9Zgtjb2bx7WhZi0uCwrBFF8", "site_full": "www.beyondblue.org.au", "site": "beyondblue.org.au", "site_section": "http://www.beyondblue.org.au/connect-with-others/online-forums/staying-well", "site_categories": ["health", "panic_anxiety_disorders", "depression"], "section_title": "Staying well ", "title": "Dilemma thread.", "title_full": "Dilemma thread.", "published": "2017-11-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.beyondblue.org.au/App_Themes/standard/images/BB_FB_logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "db989a502aa490c24294489a711e71e344a23f90", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZidBlutdGeh9Zgtjb2bx7WhQ5I4EEt2mzUvPyBVNDXaL.IDazyxAXHyCT2NZ9OYmnu", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "Elizabeth CP", "published": "2017-11-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Years ago I had a similar dilemma.

Glad you've mentioned it. Feel free to give your opinion readers.\nYour situation with your DIL is her abrasiveness, loudness and interjection which seems natural rather than vindictive.\nWhat I'd suggest is to when on the phone, calmly mention to your son to move to a quiet room so you can talk to him alone. It will take tact. When they visit ask him to go for a short walk. Capitalise on any spare moment with him to make these suggestions.\nId also fight against your not so close feelings towards your sons children. Such feelings of difference (to other grandchildren ) is natural as they have your DIL traits, but as they grow they become themselves and I'm sure you'll get closer.\nFinally, the interjection. Asking your son direct questions should get replies from him. If she answers for him (so annoying) then let her finish and calmly ask the same question to him again. \"So whats your view \" Effectively its shutting her out but...she has had her say on the topic and you've allowed her that say.\nAnother way is subtlety (hand on her forearm) \"wait a minute I want to know what he thinks about this\"\nUsing humour works. Ive got a dear neice that interjects. \"Oh dear, the interjector again\". Luckily she laughs back!\nSo move your open book to introduce subtle boundaries. If she objects thats a positive because it will be a discussion point and you can discuss how you love her very much but you also would like to hear from your son.\nGoogle\nTopic: inlaws the best approach- beyondblue\nHope all is ok otherwise.\nTony WK", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:07.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "17d7ab2d58aedfee5380872b37116aa54c811cb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZidBlutdGeh9Zgtjb2bx7WhZi0uCwrBFF8", "site_full": "www.beyondblue.org.au", "site": "beyondblue.org.au", "site_section": "http://www.beyondblue.org.au/connect-with-others/online-forums/staying-well", "site_categories": ["health", "panic_anxiety_disorders", "depression"], "section_title": "Staying well ", "title": "Dilemma thread.", "title_full": "Dilemma thread.", "published": "2017-11-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 24, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.beyondblue.org.au/App_Themes/standard/images/BB_FB_logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fec177661a0eb77752add9409af50a6982402797", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Tj4cqoEEhl0jwH5AYkuo15J304scU2fY5sBMQqjvuN4xRnovlzxbGSW8ukutvl8.Mr4WKGQoSpDVR3P7uRAZidBlutdGeh9Zgtjb2bx7WhQ5I4EEt2mzUJT3XQb8NmkG2jXA30TSiu6JXnGlyhJ0J", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "white knight", "published": "2017-11-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hi CMF\nMy thoughts too.

2017, Bollywood was jolted with back to back failures of high profile films like Tubelight , Jab Harry Met Sejal and Jagga Jasoos , to name a few. While this was the state of affairs for big films, the situation was even terrible countless other small to medium budget films, many of them boasting of popular/notable names as well, many of which were failing like ninepins at the Box Office. The situation was that of despair as Bollywood was going through one of its worst phases of not just 2017 but the current decade. Things change for a better though with Toilet \u2013 Ek Prem Katha [August], Judwaa 2 [September] and Golmaal Again [October] infusing life back in the industry. These three films not just entered the 100 Crore Club but also acted as an eye opener of sorts that audiences were fine with content based films as well as out and out entertainers, and there was no bias whatsoever. Box Office \u2013 Bollywood Sees An Unfortunate Comeback Of A Terribly Dull Phase Yes, these films boasted of saleable superstars [Akshay Kumar, Varun Dhawan, Ajay Devgn] as well which helped the cause. However, soon came Ayushmann Khurranna with a couple of good successes [ Bareilly Ki Barfi , Shubh Mangal Saavdhan ] while Rajkummar Rao [ Newton ] and Vidya Balan [ Tumhari Sulu ] too delivered decent successes, hence resuming audiences interest (and trust) in Hindi cinema. Alas, successes like these, both big and small, have turned out to be really rare in the second half of the year as well as there are more flops and disasters than what one would have bargained for. Just look at the state of affairs in the recent times. Chef [Saif Ali Khan], Haseena Parkar [Shraddha Kapoor], Daddy [Arjun Rampal], Bhoomi [Sanjay Dutt], Lucknow Central [Farhan Akhtar], Poster Boys [Sunny Deol], Simran [Kangana Ranaut], A Gentleman [Sidharth Malhotra], Firangi [Kapil Sharma] \u2013 These are the films which boast of known actors with good credentials behind them, and still there were no takers. As for films with erotica (or even the hint of it) totally died, case in point being Aksar 2 , Julie 2 and Tera Intezaar . Trending What makes the situation further depressing is the fact that while Tiger Zinda Hai would still bring in audiences, that is two weeks away. In the midst of this the only silver-lining appears to be Fukrey Returns , though that too is a film which would rely mainly on word of mouth. One can rue the fact that Padmavati could have made the situation better in theaters. However, the Sanjay Leela Bhansali directed film is just one entity (and there too one waits to see how the final product actually looks like). How does one explain though about rest of the films and their makers? Are audiences been totally ignored when it comes to creating entertaining content for them? A lot for Bollywood to ponder as one can just hope that this terribly dull phase doesn\u2019t seep into 2018 and it is the last that one has seen of it so far.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ayushmann khurranna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saif ali khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arjun rampal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sidharth malhotra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varun dhawan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ajay devgn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "padmavati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanjay dutt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akshay kumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanjay leela bhansali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shubh mangal saavdhan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ek prem katha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajkummar rao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shraddha kapoor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kapil sharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jagga jasoos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "farhan akhtar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhoomi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bareilly ki barfi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jab harry met sejal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haseena parkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vidya balan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judwaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simran [kangana ranaut", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crore club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tera intezaar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "box office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aksar", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucknow", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:08.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d887103f13916cb242f7b4c28f692697e32e2dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3Il5tbgyGRZwU9I3k5qSOoPIz8y4umCV5.PoWasWoua5Kd9swFyytJXl1TdEXTIiqCJkK_ZYG5BhWy_zreMv3CPn.3Cgg3T4haX.bYObb2TmQGnrmrkZF_SzikqExX02uE-", "site_full": "examplecommonapplicationessays.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://examplecommonapplicationessays.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Example Common Application Essays", "title": "'Lessons My Father Taught Me (And What I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Trying To Teach Him)'", "title_full": "'Lessons My Father Taught Me (And What I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Trying To Teach Him)'", "published": "2017-12-07T11:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3d887103f13916cb242f7b4c28f692697e32e2dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3Il5tbgyGRZwU9I3k5qSOoPIz8y4umCV5.PoWasWoua5Kd9swFyytJXl1TdEXTIiqCJkK_ZYG5BhWy_zreMv3CPn.3Cgg3T4haX.bYObb2TmQGnrmrkZF_SzikqExX02uE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Luke PHILLIPS (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "'Lessons My Father Taught Me (And What I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Trying To Teach Him)'", "text": "'My soda pop likes overage cars, albeit tuned up with tires safe for optimal performance.

At that age young adults have their needs/wants but they can't have everything. A steep learning curve is to appreciate what they have which is what you can provide them.\nI dont want to suggest Im a better parent but my then 15yo daughter was told to get a job. She did at a pizza shop. Then we moved further out and told her again at 16yo to get a job. Next day she came home from school \"my new friends told me there is only 3 cafes and a fish and chip shop in town and I wont get work there.\"\nI told her to apply. She did and got two jobs! She worked at both for 3 weeks then dropped one. She stayed there for 5 years. She saved for a new car.

In short trade down, own your home, dont cater for everyones needs too much and think ahead. And if it all means selling when the kids are at school next year so be it.

He will adapt to whatever housing arrangement your provide him. At that age they just submit their list and \"mum will think of me and take care of it\" lol. I suppose its tough love and before you know it he will be more mature and be helping out, becoming your friends as well.\nI think also he will benefit from one on one talk. Explaining the facts like why he cant have this or that, like explaining why you have to sacrifice the bedroom size for the benefit of no mortgage so you can afford to also educate the younger ones as they grow. etc.\nYou are wise CMF.

It is not time to downsize with 3 children at home but it will mean I could buy outright. My current hoke has enough room and the option of converting the rumpus room to a bedroom. The place I buy will need a garage with internal access which i can convert a 4th bedroom. I do not want all the bells and whistles as there are people whom i do not want to know my business. I also think it would be very stressful for myself and the kids so i am wanting to sell off market. It is doabale but my dilemma is this;\nThis weekend my older kids are at their dad's house which meant i could give their house a really good clean, declutter their rooms and have it looking really good. Today my RE agent was going to do a 'quiet open' and invite a handful of suitable buyers/underbidders from today's auctions. Unfortunately, due to the extreme weather and storms in Melbourne he rang last night and suggested cancelling/postponing as a few of the people were not sure if they would cmd out if the weather was bad and one couple in particular who is interested is coming from across town and needs to use the freeway which is not advisable today. He was happy to go ahead with it but we agreed that it may be a fizzer as we don't want 1 person to show up as it will look like there is no other interest. the agent has told me we can reschedule whenever i want to before December 20, just say the word .\nMy son is quite anxious at the moment as he is starting year 11 next year, he also doesn't like the thought of selling as he is concerned about where we will live and will we have enough room. I don't want to be doing this next year when he starts school,however it is so close to xmas now and I don't think i will have any weekends where the 2 older ones are not home. They also finish school this week so even less time available.\nNext year i my little one goes to school and i want to return to work, however i am not sure it will improve my situation and I am tired of struggling all the time.

Going into the match to be played at the Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos, Kenya, Kilimanjaro Stars Head Coach, Ammy Ninje said charges will bounce back after a disappointing start to this year\u2019s campaign. Kilimanjaro Stars played out to a disappointing barren draw with Libya in second match of Group A on day one of the regional tournament at the Kenyatta Stadium last Sunday. Ninje, a former Hull City Academy Development coach, picked one point in his first match since he took over at Kilimanjaro Stars last November, despite the Mainlanders\u2019 slow start in the first half.\u201cAgainst Libya, we played well but surely it wasn\u2019t a pleasing result to us but we will work to iron out the shortcomings we observed in the opening match,\u201d he said. Ninje took some positives against Libya, in which the team had a good cohesion from the rear to attack only that they need to take their chances. Stars will need to put up a big fight to post positive result in today\u2019s game so as to put themselves in a good position to progress into the next stage of the tournament and escape an early elimination. Kilimanjaro Stars will have to be at their best to beat Zanzibar Heroes, who showed plenty of qualities during their 3-1 win over Rwanda\u2019s Amavubi at the same venue on Tuesday. Midfielder Mudathir Yahya put Heroes ahead in the first half but Muhadjiri Hakizmana pulled level immediately after the restart. Issa Juma restored Heroes lead before Kassim Khamis sealed the victory for Hemed Morocco\u2019s charges. While Kilimanjaro Stars will be looking to earn their first win in the tournament, the Heroes will be targeting to maintain their winning formula as well paving their way to the next stage. Victory for Zanzibar Heroes will see them going at the top of the group with six points deposing hosts Kenya, who will not be in action today until Saturday, when they will face Zanzibar. Kilimanjaro Stars and Zanzibar Heroes match will precede the game between Rwanda\u2019s Amavubi and Libya, which will take place at the same venue later on the day. The match will be a do or die for Rwanda as a defeat will see them shown an exit door. Ninje charges are placed fourth in the group with a point from one match. Host Kenya top group A with four points from two matches, while Zanzibar are second on three points from one game. Guest side Libya, are third on two points from two matches, while Rwanda are placed bottom of the group without a point from two matches. After today\u2019s encounter, Kilimanjaro Stars next outing will be on Saturday, when they will confront Amavubi of Rwanda. It might be a formality game, especially if the Rwandese loses today against the \u2018Mediterranean Knights\u2019. In group B playing the matches in Kakamega, there will be only one game in which Ethiopia will face Burundi\u2019s \u2018Intamurugamba\u2019 who will be battling for the group top position. Ethiopia top group B with three points, following their 3-0 victory over South Sudan on Monday. They are two points ahead of Burundi and defending champions Uganda Cranes, who fought to a barren draw in the opening game early this week. Tomorrow will be a rest day for group A, while in group B Uganda Cranes will play against South Sudan with Moses Basena\u2019s side targeting victory to keep alive their title defence campaign.
