My mother was in labour for three days and three nights because the baby was breached and there was no available medical facilities and personnel on time that could have saved both mother and child.\u201d \nAkenroye, who heads BalmGilead Hospital in Lagos, regrets that \u201c50 years after, maternal mortality rates still remain high. \u201cWomen should not die because they are pregnant and people should get enough information necessary to stop the unnecessary deaths. That is why we are raising a foundation in remembrance of my mother. It is wrong that many women still die out of ignorance to access the available medical facilities and to utilize them, he said.\u201d \nParticipants trooped out in their hundreds to the Comprehensive High School, Ilutitun venue of the health outreach as early as 7am to take advantage of the services. About one thousand people came for the free treatment that included check-ups for blood pressure, blood sugar level, BMI, and treatment of various diseases. There were free surgical operations while free medicated eye glasses were handed out as well. There were also counseling services. \nOn the various ailments treated, Akenroye said the \u201cmedical team encountered different cases. \u201cThere are cases needing surgical intervention. We had cases of hernia, infertility, fibroids, dental cases among others. Many malaria and bacteria infection cases were also treated. Some have chronic diseases, like arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, insomnia and geriatric diseases and were assisted. A lot of people with high blood pressure, and other chronic diseases were screened, counseled and treated for the first time. This program has helped them to know their health status,\u201d he stated. \nHe also lamented the ignorance the people live with regarding their health. \u201cThere is a major problem while the people are not aware of what the hospitals have in stock. We had to educate them about medical facilities we have brought. Many in the community had problem with going to hospitals to get information about their health and available health provisions.\u201d \nDr Akenroye recalled how his mother died young because of delay in accessing medical facilities. \u201cShe was in labour for three days and three nights because they could not even transport her to where to get medical assistance. Even when she was eventually transported to the general hospital, the only doctor had travelled. She had to wait for another 24 hours to get the emergency treatment she needed. However, despite a surgical intervention, she lost her life due to post-operative complications.\u201d \n\u201cUnfortunately, even 50 years after, according to the statistics available there are about 5,000 mothers that still died after child birth last year and those were the ones reported.\u201d \nAlso helping out at the health outreach was a retired Chief Medical Consultant at the Ondo State Specialist Hospital Akure, Dr. Manuwa Idowu Akenroye and Dr Ilesami Ogunsuyi, the director of Medical services at the Federal Prisons in Ondo State. \nThe Consultant and uncle to the initiator of the project added that, \u201cDr. Akenroye\u2019s mother died during child birth when he was a little boy. Fortunately I was with him I know the story and when he turned around and told me he wants to do this I said that is a good thought and I wish him well. \n\u201cThe program is about preventing mothers and children from dying. To me if we can dedicate a day every year to remember this woman with this kind of event, it is worth it.\u201d \nMrs. Monisola Akenroye, an accountant and wife of the initiator of the project who was deeply involved in the planning, expressed satisfaction and fulfillment at the success of the outreach. \u201c\u201dI feel fulfilled I know that what we are doing now is exactly what God really wants us to do. This is not the first outreach but this is the first major one because we have had series of outreaches in America where we raised funds for children living with cancer. We have also raised funds for St. Joseph\u2019s home, a motherless babies home, and for abandoned mothers\u2019 homes. We have been doing it in our small ways but this is the first major outing and we are thrilled about the outcome\u2019. She promised that it would henceforth be a regular event. \nOn the NGO\u2019s future plan, she revealed that, \u201cWhat we intend to do is to put up a mother and child health centre. Not really a full-fledged hospital but somewhere they can get them information awareness on what is going on. Majorly we intend to have an ambulance service so that in case of emergency they can easily use it to move people around to the nearest hospital.\u201d \nOne of the beneficiaries Mrs. Grace Daso, 75, a retired teacher expressed appreciation for the initiative. \u201cI thank the organisers for this kind gesture. I have been battling an eye defect and this is coming at the right time. \nThe remembrance events which was kick-started with a thanksgiving and launch of the Victoria Aderemelekun Akenroye Foundation on November 12 (including the launch of her biography titled The Ultimate Sacrifice at the Redeemed Christian Church of God (Grace Sanctuary) in Lagos, followed by the medical outreach on 17th and 18th November, climaxed with a two \u2013day gospel crusade at Ilutitun. \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "prisca sam-duru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manuwa idowu akenroye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monisola akenroye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilutitun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akenroye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madam victoria aderemilekun akenroye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilesami ogunsuyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grace daso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adegboyega akenroye", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "redeemed christian church of god", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balmgilead hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "comprehensive high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ngo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria aderemelekun akenroye foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balmgilead life support", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "okitipupa local government area of ondo state", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ondo state specialist hospital akure", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ondo state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilutitun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:21.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6344c9fb4917743158556e0488eb31b2add52f0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwj3wydD8tfME6K.I.ynYtrLaggImQ2bE56NF7oj_ce5HpJ5QUoDeXgneHUM_1ovqy_vXRNQmlRBM7s8o4tufnEyWeJezriUveZdV7J0KQrjg--", "site_full": "forums.thefashionspot.com", "site": "thefashionspot.com", "site_section": "http://forums.thefashionspot.com/f78/", "site_categories": ["fashion", "style_and_fashion"], "section_title": "Magazines -

The study is a key step in preparation for CE-marking and European launch of the kit in early 2018. In June 2017, Agendia announced an extension of its relationship with Agilent Technologies Inc. to develop an RNA sequencing-based version of its existing microarray-based MammaPrint and BluePrint tests. Adding the MammaPrint BluePrint Kit to Agendia's portfolio will enable cancer centers to run the tests on their existing next-generation sequencing (NGS) instruments in their own laboratories. Performing the test locally offers greater access so that more patients can benefit from the personalized treatment that these tests enable. The study will involve UZ Leuven processing breast tumor samples from patients enrolled in the study using the NGS-based MammaPrint BluePrint Kit. Their results will be directly compared with those from the currently marketed MammaPrint microarray-based test, performed at the Company's Amsterdam CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratory, to demonstrate the comparability of the two technologies. Dr. Marjolaine Baldo, Commercial Vice President, EMEA at Agendia, said: \"UZ Leuven is one of the largest and most prestigious academic centers in Belgium and we are very pleased to have such a well-respected partner working alongside us to co-validate the performance of our decentralized kit. This is an exciting time for Agendia as co-validation is one of the final steps to complete before we launch our CE-marked MammaPrint BluePrint Kit in 2018. We look forward to providing both centralized and decentralized services, offering clinical labs, physicians and patients more choice in how they access these important tests.\" Prof. Dr. Giuseppe Floris, Breast Pathologist at UZ Leuven, said: \"It is a real honor for us to be part of this technological advancement of the MammaPrint and BluePrint tests to NGS.

What he did was child abuse, and it's time for the press to admit it. Comments \nPhoto Credit: Screenshot / YouTube \nHeadlines typically attempt to draw in readers by including the most relevant or pertinent information, but in the case of breaking news Monday that President Trump had endorsed Roy Moore in next week\u2019s Senate special election in Alabama, the single most important fact of the case\u2014that Moore faces multiple sexual abuse charges \u2014was omitted by the majority of outlets altogether. LA Times ( 12/4/17 ): \u201cTrump Fully Endorses Alabama Senate Candidate Roy Moore\u201d CNN ( 12/4/17 ): \u201cTrump Calls Roy Moore to Offer His Endorsement\u201d New York Times ( 12/4/17 ): \u201cRoy Moore Gets Trump Endorsement and RNC Funding for Senate Race\u201d Politico ( 12/4/17 ): \u201cTrump Endorses Roy Moore, RNC Plans to Go Back Into Alabama Race\u201d Washington Post ( 12/4/17 ): \u201cTrump: \u2018We need Republican Roy Moore to Win in Alabama\u2019\u201d Chicago Tribune ( 12/4/17 ): \u201cRNC Restarts Support for Roy Moore After Trump\u2019s Hearty Endorsement\u201c \nThe fact that a Republican president would endorse a Republican for a Senate race is not really news. Under normal circumstances, it would be hardly worth a mention\u2026but these aren\u2019t normal circumstances. What makes it news\u2014what justifies the entire reporting of the story\u2014is that Trump is backing someone accused by multiple people , backed by years of circumstantial evidence , of sexual assault and child sexual abuse. The far more relevant framing is \u201cTrump Backs Alabama Senate Candidate Accused of Sexual Abuse.\u201d That\u2019s what makes it a story. \nThose that do mention the abuse often used a vague \u201c sex allegation \u201d framing. The instinct to downplay the charges can be seen in two New York Daily Newsheadlines ( 12/4/17) . When the story is viewed full-sized, it has the awkward, redundant headline, \u201cTrump Officially Endorses Roy Moore, Despite Sexual Allegations Claims, With \u2018Go Get \u2018Em, Roy\u2019 Message.\u201d When the window is reduced, however, the story bears the more accurate headline, \u201cTrump Endorses Moore Despite Sex Assault Claims.\u201d \nSimilarly, CNBC (\u201cTrump Formally Endorses Roy Moore Despite Sex Allegations Against the Alabama Senate Candidate,\u201d 12/4/17 ), Vice (\u201cWhat Happens Now After the Roy Moore Sex Allegations? Here Are a Few Possibilities,\u201d 11/9/17 ) andNew York Times (\u201cSex Allegations Against Roy Moore Send Republicans Reeling,\u201d 11/9/17 ) framed the issue in terms of \u201callegations,\u201d turning acts of violence into nebulous \u201csex\u201d scandals. \nNPR ( 12/4/17 ) watered down this headline from the already euphemistic \u201cTrump Endorses Roy Moore for First Time Since Sex Allegations.\u201d \nNPR \u2019s original headline was in the same vein: \u201cTrump Endorses Roy Moore for First Time Since Sex Allegations.\u201d That was apparently deemed too specific for public radio, however, and was replaced by \u201cRNC Restores Financial Support for Roy Moore as Trump Gives Full Endorsement\u201d ( 12/4/17 ). Bloomberg ( 12/4/17 ), on the other hand, originally had \u201cTrump Endorses Roy Moore for Senate, Despite Sex Allegations,\u201d and later amended that to \u201cTrump Endorses Roy Moore Despite Sexual-Misconduct Allegations.\u201d \nAs Mary Elizabeth Williams explained (Salon, 6/29/12 ) in 2012, referring to sexual assault or attempted child rape merely as \u201csex\u201d flattens the predatory nature and severity of the crime: \nWhen you\u2019re dealing with a story that involves rape or harassment or abuse or molestation or child porn or anything that falls under the rubric of criminal behavior, you should call those things rape and harassment and abuse and molestation and child pornography. You know what you shouldn\u2019t call them? Sexy sexy sex scandals, that\u2019s what\u2026 \nA sex scandal is Mark Sanford ditching his state to cavort with his mistress. A sex scandal is Tiger Woods and a waitress\u2026. But when the media uses the word \u201csex\u201d within a story about something where there are alleged victims of assault, it\u2019s a semantic failure on an epic scale. It diminishes crime. It sensationalizes it. It removes the distinction between a normal, consensual act and violence. \nFAIR has repeatedly pointed out that only 40 percent of readers read past the headlines , which means most people form their worldview based on how a story is framed. Perhaps editors assumed readers were intimate with the allegations against Moore, that the antecedent was obvious. But recent polls show people are either ignorant or confused, with 89 percent of likely Alabama voters pinning the allegations on \u201cnewspapers and the media\u201d and 10 percent having never heard of them at all. Certainly the fact of the president\u2014himself accused by assault by multiple women \u2014throwing his considerable weight behind someone running under a cloud of pedophilia should lead the story. \nEditors perhaps want to avoid harsh or unseemly language. Which is a perfectly fine instinct, if such language is gratuitous or unrelated\u2014but in this case, the depravity and visceral disgust of the crime in question is the story. By skirting the terms \u201cchild abuse\u201d or \u201csexual assault,\u201d media are burying the severity of the major issue at hand: that the most powerful person earth just endorsed a possible child molester. Newspapers aren\u2019t meant to be managers of cognitive dissonance; in theory, they\u2019re conveyors of truthful information. By burying and downplaying what makes this story news, they are protecting people\u2019s feelings rather than plainly stating what\u2019s at stake, and in doing so providing cover for an accused child abuser and his growing list of enablers. \n\nAdam Johnson is a contributing analyst at FAIR and contributing writer for AlterNet.

By placing race at the centre of its analysis, this volume brings together fourteen chapters that examine, question, and explain the growing intersection between criminal justice and migration control. Through the lens of race, we see how criminal justice and migration enmesh in order to exclude, stop, and excise racialized citizens and non-citizens from societies across the world within, beyond, and along borders. \nNeatly organized in four parts, the book begins with chapters that present a conceptual analysis of race, borders, and social control, moving to the institutions that make up and shape the criminal justice and migration complex. The remaining chapters are convened around the key sites where criminal justice and migration control intersect: policing, courts, and punishment. Together the volume presents a critical and timely analysis of how race shapes and complicates mobility and how racism is enabled and reanimated when criminal justice and migration control coalesce. Race and the meaning of race in relation to citizenship and belonging is excavated throughout the chapters presented in the book, thereby transforming the way we think about migration. \nMary Bosworth , Professor of Criminology and Fellow of St Cross College at the University of Oxford and, concurrently, Professor of Criminology at Monash University, Australia. \nAlpa Parmar , lecturer at the Oxford University Centre for Criminology. \nYolanda Vazquez , Associate Professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Law . \nKJ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yolanda vazquez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alpa parmar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary bosworth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kj", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "oxford university press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "criminal justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of cincinnati college of law", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monash university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st cross college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of oxford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford university centre for criminology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:22.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8e5b0519530279d212d4be3b94bb6547d5c9218b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq_JhlZA7p2YLj.wRYES980xeBerg08i1WwrzDtKHYccv3yhs82sRZ36jbNTX8s3vvOlijjrOcU1LhybaU0Kr0VfYYPHBqiG8Y-", "site_full": "sciencecenteronline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://sciencecenteronline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Science Center Online", "title": "Google Alert - science", "title_full": "Google Alert - science", "published": "2017-12-07T10:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8e5b0519530279d212d4be3b94bb6547d5c9218b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq_JhlZA7p2YLj.wRYES980xeBerg08i1WwrzDtKHYccv3yhs82sRZ36jbNTX8s3vvOlijjrOcU1LhybaU0Kr0VfYYPHBqiG8Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Thimend (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Alert - science", "text": "science As-it-happens update \u22c5 December 7, 2017 NEWS The World's Largest Organism Is Dying Live Science \"What you all think of as trees are actually one living and connected being,\" Rogers told Live Science . \"Being in this grove or this forest to me is pretty magical.\" Though Pando has often been called the oldest living organism on Earth (with some estimates claiming the stand is upward of 80,000 years old) ...

And the story Continues! +Raid", "text": "What is Final Fantasy Brave Exvius?\nA mobile game for iOS and Android, produced in collaboration between Square Enix (Final Fantasy et al) and Gumi/Alim (responsible for Brave Frontier). The game\u2019s story is based around a young knight named Rain and his friend and stepbrother Lasswell, who one day encounter a strange sight: a young girl trapped in a crystal. Following her words, they encounter the power of \u201cVisions,\u201d or the ability to summon warriors from other places and times to assist in battle.\nNote to new or returning players\nDue to the developer's servers being hacked, there's a pause on new content presently. No user data was compromised or negatively affected (the developers don't keep that stuff since they outsource it to FB, Google, etc.), but the devs appear to be focusing on security updates in lieu of new content. Do the story, farm some stuff, and I'm sure it'll be rolling with new stuff before we know it!\nWhat is with the name of the game?\nIt's SquareEnix, responsible for making a trilogy of games called Fabula Nova Crystalis. They're kind of known now for making up fanciful words like Crystarium, and Dissidia Duodecim 012, and 358/2 Days. Be the Bravest Exvius you can be, and define that on your own terms, that's what I say.\nI've played Brave Frontier and liked/hated it. How does this compare?\nFinal Fantasy Brave Exvius is an expanded spin on Brave Frontier, with whom it shares some similarities. It's another gacha game, meaning you will earn in-game currency, coming in the form of Friend Points and Lapis, to summon new units on a seemingly unfair spreadsheet of hidden factors that emerge in the form of unique characters, and many familiar to the world of Final Fantasy. This game, though, adds the usual Final Fantasy elements of equipment and materia, giving a surprising depth to the gameplay as units can be mixed and matched with different abilities and stats boosted or modified.Each unit can equip up to 6 types of equipment and 4 materia, but each unit also has limitations and advantages to what they can equip and use.\nYou mentioned Final Fantasy characters? I love Final Fantasy!\nFFBE has a wide variety of characters from Final Fantasy, with its own beefy roster of unique names original to FFBE. Characters from Final Fantasy 1 all the way to 15 and even outliers such as Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy Type-0 are represented. Funny enough, there are no Final Fantasy 7 or 8 characters yet, but they\u2019re coming (we know they are coming soon, due to the JP version being ahead). The animation sprites used in this game are gorgeous, by the way.\nThe roster of characters in game is a mishmash of various Final Fantasy games and units exclusive to FFBE, although most people care about the FF characters. As previously mentioned, characters are added to the gacha, usually alongside special events that tie into the game they're from (unless it's just more FFBE exclusives). Unlike other games of this type, the rarity isn't just in the higher rank of the unit, but also the characters themselves. You should ignore the fact that the Exdeath you pulled is 3*, for example, because it's possible to increase the rarity of units to their natural cap (Exdeath is capable of reaching 6*, the game's current top rarity).\nFurther, different units are good at different things. A healer like Rosa may be less valuable than a damage dealer like Gilgamesh, since the best defense is often a good offense. There are other mechanics in play, such as elemental affinity, stat breaks, buffs, and so forth, to keep it ever evolving around the core gameplay.\nHere's a link to a site that will update regularly as the global version gets more characters, and ranks the units by various categories to back up the reasoning for their position in the tier list. Unit Rankings\nI'm new, and got a bunch of these characters out of my first 11-pull. Are any of these good? I love Shadow/Sabin/Penelo!\nUnfortunately, your Shadow/Sabin/Penelo are some of the worst characters in the game. Yes, they are beloved Final Fantasy characters, but that doesn't exclude them from being King of the Trash Heap. Someone has to be, right? A lot of early characters are mainline Final Fantasy units, but by nature of power creep, they\u2019ve been long overshadowed by new units. Different units are powerful or weak in different ways, and just because a unit is popular in their original Final Fantasy series doesn\u2019t mean they will be useful in FFBE.\nHowever, FFBE is unique in that many older units are perfectly viable. Good team composition and strategy can make mid-tier units very good, and sometimes spending a bit of time thinking through a tough fight can result in eeking out a well-deserved win. Many players are F2P (they spend no money) and have a good roster of units, or are otherwise able to tackle some of the hardest content in the game.\nIf you're just starting out and want to know who to look for, note that as we are 18 months into the game, the hardest content tends to require some fancy gear and \"rainbow\" base units. If you see a rainbow crystal, rejoice, for it will grant a 5* base unit, which range from useful to very powerful and can easily secure a spot on your team!\nTHIS SECTION SUBJECT TO PENDING UPDATE\n3* units to look for: Cecil, Exdeath, Timothy, Camille -- any that can go to 6, generally, otherwise they're only useful at the very beginning\n4* base units to look for (gold crystal or better): Chizuru, Warrior of Light, Garnet, Mystea, Agrias, Refia, Veritas of the Earth, Rikku, Ashe\n5* base units to look for (prismatic crystals only): Orlandeau, Veritas of the Dark, Ayaka, Tidus, Onion Knight -- basically anyone but Lightning!\n3* base units that if your entire starting roster is full of, you might want to re-roll: Vivi, Lani, Galuf, Shadow, Penelo, Sabin, Maria, Fran, Clyne, Russell, Bedile, Anzelm, Gilbert, Rakshasa, Medius, Cyan\nHelpful Links:\nExviusWiki : Best source for Global version information, with maps for exploration dungeons, quest guides, and unit details.\nFinal Fantasy Brave Exvius Reddit : The reddit community for FFBE, containing info and updates for both the Japan and Global versions. Check here if you want to know what kind of stuff we'll get 5-6 months in advance since Japan gets it first. Also contains useful player-submitted guides, and has a Wiki which is up to date with the current state of Japan's game, so you can look ahead at unit enhancements and trust masteries, that sort of thing.\nFriend ID List!:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HfEIPxz_tV42C8dhfSiuVsWJ_f2YQhXiNg5BwiuJCik/edit?usp=sharing\nTo find your friend ID in the game, tap Home in the upper right corner (on most screens), then the Menu icon in the upper right, then Player Info on the left. Your ID should look like this in your little character card: 123,456,789. This is also where you change your greeting, and rename your character if you like. Adding friends is the only way to use your \"guest character\" limit break in combat, and only your current party's Leader is shared to friends. Remember to set a Companion Party from the Options in the Main Menu! This way, you will always have a party set up with a specific character that will be shared to your friends, and you should never ever edit that party except to change the Leader if you want to change who you share.\n|| Flickr \u2014 || PSN: EggyToast EggyToast on December 6", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HfEIPxz_tV42C8dhfSiuVsWJ_f2YQhXiNg5BwiuJCik/edit?usp=sharing", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/editor/gl/u1pkmojvs6e5.jpg", "https://i.imgur.com/NEQRlx7.gif", "http://exvius.gamepedia.com/Unit_Rankings", "https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Final_Fantasy_Brave_Exvius_Wiki", "https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:23.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c81b0f34289c23ee0904a9b113d7d0fe920f3561", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQdgAGIX74_9bFcufSnLqMW0PoqFUhEKRZYpHUvfcQDUJqtLydIYTubDZMeZQScmEmpm_Ar3K6u6HF7Nzy89q191UXluKMm6j8K8Ah0xpHB261z.vp_EvqPll34jsU9K3Q-", "site_full": "jeffschrembs.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://jeffschrembs.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "December 7th the day/date that will live in infamy \u2013 Jeff Schrembs", "title": "December 7th the day/date that will live in infamy", "title_full": "December 7th the day/date that will live in infamy", "published": "2017-12-07T11:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c81b0f34289c23ee0904a9b113d7d0fe920f3561", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQdgAGIX74_9bFcufSnLqMW0PoqFUhEKRZYpHUvfcQDUJqtLydIYTubDZMeZQScmEmpm_Ar3K6u6HF7Nzy89q191UXluKMm6j8K8Ah0xpHB261z.vp_EvqPll34jsU9K3Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jeff Schrembs", "published": "2017-12-07T11:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "December 7th the day/date that will live in infamy", "text": "World War II, like the war before it, was horrific. The cowardly attack by the Japanese, while they lied behind ongoing peace negotiations, on December 7th 1941 destroyed steel, metal, engines, warships, men, and their families. This generation sees a date and a history book maybe. I see my Uncles, My Grandfather. The knowledge of the senseless deaths of the Jewish people and hundreds of thousands if not millions. Again, this generation knows not.\nI first read Anne Frank\u2019s diary in elementary school. The teacher, whose name I still somehow remember and her lessons helped to form me, did not check this book out in the library. It was purchased with an inscription. As I read about Anne Frank and how her father served in World War I for the Germans. How he moved his family to Amsterdam In the 1930s to get away from the growing NAZI fanaticism. He did not envision the NAZI\u2019s taking over Amsterdam in less than a month.\nI have always had a fascination about Anne Frank. Several months ago my granddaughter told me she was reading about Anne Frank. It instigated a conversation for over an hour. The story of Anne Frank resonates. It should never be forgotten. She was found, taken to a NAZI concentration, at a time when the Germans knew the war would soon be over and they lost. Friends of Anne Frank tell about her before the war and some witnessed her, and her sister Margot, getting sick and inhumanly starved. Anne Frank died in the muck in a death camp made of barbed wire and evil.\nHer diary never should have survived. Her father had packed it in his briefcase but when the NAZI (only one was there) and the Police (made up of Amsterdam men who swore allegiance to the NAZI\u2019s) came they took the briefcase, dumped it\u2019s contents in the floor, and told him \u201call you can bring must fit into this briefcase. They told him he had a few more minutes as they knew he was a WWI veteran. Anne Frank\u2019s diary was left behind but by the grace of God it was saved and secretly kept. The words that brave little girl wrote, and the horrific times and emotions she felt, are awe inspiring and bitterly sad knowing she left this world a victim of evil personified.\nI have just about every photo of Anne Frank including those recently discovered. You see a little girl with life in her eyes. You see her in a winter coat. You see her smiling. You see her growth. You see a young girl who played in the sun. A daughter. A friend. Her eyes. There is something about her eyes that manifest through the photographs. Friends say she was feisty and full of life. I think that comes across n her photographs.\nOur family, besides the ones already mentioned, has a relative that was a General in WWII. President Eisenhower called him \u201cthe most complete General in the War and whose resolve he leaned on throughout\u201d. Even without that relation in my bloodline are countless men who fought. Who died. Who loved. Who tried. They are not forgotten.\nI have a son who serves in the US Military as my brother did for a few years. I was recruited at High School, all branches came during the year and all male students attended in the auditorium, but when they learned and saw that I had broken my right hand index finger, and had pin installed as the tendon was severed, I was considered \u201cimpaired\u201d and that ended that. But, shortly thereafter the draft became mandatory for all males 18 and over. The cold war was raging as was the middle east. Whenever I see, or hear, about equal/women\u2019s rights, which I applaud and respect, the fact that they aren\u2019t required to be in the draft is a feeling they will never know. It\u2019s sad how boys, men etc. have been traumatized by all the hate directed at them beginning decades ago. It should stop.\nTo all the veterans, military, their families, etc. I say \u201cmay God bless you all\u201d.\nTake care.\nJeff Schrembs\nPS: If I remember correctly someone has a birthday around this time. In spite of the fact that, for years, they have tried for years to \u201cerase me\u201d I do wish them a Happy Birthday. I do wish them happiness. I do wish them good health. I do wish all the best in life for them on this day and the other 364.

I would have heard about this if it was right. It means that you never need an ability that grants 100% provoke. You'll always just need 83.33% with a 6-man party.\nIf you add items like Great Raven's Cape, which grants 100% camouflage, you can drop that percentage to 80% provoke, because 100% camouflage essentially removes a unit from the party as far as hit percentages are concerned. Tilith has 75% camouflage. Combined with Montana's TMR will raise that to above 100%. Also works with Mystea (50% camouflage passive).\nThis leaves the necessary provoke at 66.7%. Which is what Golem's Provoke gives you.\nWhat if you put Wilhelm on the party, though. 50% passive provoke. Give him Pink Striped Float and his passive provoke becomes 65%. Put him on a 6-man party with Tilith + Camouflage, Mystea + Camouflage, and a unit with Great Raven's Cape, and he'll have 98.3% passive provoke.\nWith Iris' TMR, he'll have 113.3% provoke. You could even remove Tilith or Mystea from the party.\nCan someone confirm that provoke additively stacks with party-size-based hit percentage?\nJust make a 2-man party with a fully leveled Wilhelm or Snow and a unit without provoke or camouflage or counter and take them to Earth Shrine. Have both of them defend, activate a macro that just hits repeat over and over, and leave the game running for a few hours. See if the not-Snow/Wilhelm has any damage.\n[edit] I would do it myself, but I don't have Wilhelm and I don't want to waste energy/cactuars leveling up Snow.\n[edit] Oh, and party position matters, apparently. So Wilhelm/Snow will have to be on position 1.\n[edit] Nope, this doesn't work. Snow and Wilhelm have Counter, so they'll counter the dire rats to death.\nHmm... Equip them with fire weapons and take them to Ifrit? No, he has AoE attacks...\nFudge.\n[edit] Use the Chamber of Recollection to take them to the Chizuru fight on Gronoa. Kill two other units (I think Fina and someone else) and MP drain Chizuru until she only does regular attacks*. Then see if she only hits Wilhelm/Snow. Don't equip Wilhelm/Snow with any weapons or atk/materia.

Of course that's about the number I had for the Nier banner and I burned well over that only pulling a single rainbow (and a few 9S) so that certainly doesn't fill me with hope either.\nOn another note, I've been trying to get the Octopus Teacher down and man is it frustrating. I've got the units for it and they more than have the ability to do it, but each attempt I seem to be obliterated fairly randomly.

Theresa May has said the UK will not be copying Donald Trump\u2019s decision to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem \nAsked at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions whether she had been consulted on the move by the US president, Mrs May said: \u201cI\u2019m intending to speak to President Trump about this matter. But, our position has not changed.\u201d \nThe comments came after Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson voiced \u201cconcern\u201d over the expected announcement by Mr Trump. \nHe said: \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see what the president says exactly, but we view the reports that we have heard with concern, because we think that Jerusalem obviously should be part of the final settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, a negotiated settlement that we want to see.\u201d Boris Johnson stands in front of the Dome of the Rock during a visit to Temple Mount/Haram al Sharif in Jerusalem in 2015 (Stefan Rousseau/PA) \nThe expected move by Mr Trump has sparked consternation around the world, amid fears that it could provoke violent protests by Palestinians who may view it as America dropping its long-standing position of neutrality in the Middle East peace process to side with Israel. \nManuel Hassassian, Palestinian general delegate to the UK, said the move would \u201ckill the peace process\u201d and provoke a violent reaction. \n\u201cHe\u2019s declaring war against 1.5 billion Muslims, hundreds of millions of Christians that are not going to accept their holy shrines to be totally under the hegemony of Israel, let alone that East Jerusalem has always been known as \u2026 the future capital of Palestine.\u201d \nShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said: \u201cEven by Donald Trump\u2019s abysmally low standards, to choose this point to move the US embassy and recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital is a breathtakingly-dangerous decision, which will not just set back the hopes of finding a political settlement between Israel and Palestine, but threatens to trigger even greater instability and radicalisation throughout the Middle East.\u201d \nDear Friends,You may have seen the news overnight, set to be confirmed today, that Donald Trump has decided to move\u2026 \nPosted by Emily Thornberry on Wednesday, December 6, 2017 \nReports of Mr Trump\u2019s plan sparked security warnings on Tuesday, with US personnel and their families ordered to avoid visiting Jerusalem\u2019s Old City or the West Bank. \nThe US has never previously endorsed the Jewish state\u2019s claim of sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem, insisting its status must be resolved through Israeli-Palestinian negotiation. \nOfficials said that recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital would be an acknowledgement of \u201chistorical and current reality\u201d, rather than an intervention in the politics of the peace process. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said he reminded Mr Trump in a phone call on Monday that the status of Jerusalem should be determined through negotiations on a two-state solution for the Middle East.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emily thornberry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount/haram al sharif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manuel hassassian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boris johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stefan rousseau/pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs may", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem dome of the rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "old city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:23.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "77e57cdf979e0355b3f6d7a28ff788c9ce782a24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl.Zq0O9QZ4xcWyFFbJXXPhc3hJGWkmJT9234a869X2CjF_EZXHRrXDOIWAIl_DwMhVWFbHqzIGjlUtzy.vG1tSwvNmINoDIIELU8639APymruTRTkLAVNHk-", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[FFBE] Our first \"real\" bard arrives Friday, with Roy!
