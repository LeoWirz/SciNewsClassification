So be kind with yourself as you continue to uncover and explore realms of understanding, for there is a progressive nature to the application of the vision, desires, and even the call upon your life. For as you change, so will the application of your response to the call upon your life. And as you mature, learn, and grow, so also will the nature of your capacity to respond to the call upon your life (1). \nSo be patient as I continue to inspire you to move in new directions, to explore different ideas, and to engage in different practices and encounters. Remain flexible in your approach and in your interpretation of what I have shown you and said to you. For you will find new layers of understanding will be revealed as you continue to grow and mature. In the development of what I have set within you, and set before you, you will find there is complexity and subtlety not fully perceived, nor appreciated in its initial encounter. And with this you will find there are details and factors that need to be addressed and attended to that were not apparent in the initial inception.\nAs you grow, understand so also will your interpretation of how to respond to what I am saying for you. For the gifts and calls upon your life are irrevocable, but your understanding and response to them is not.

And with this openness you will be able to hear and receive what I am actually saying, rather than pushing against the presumptions in your heart that resist my will and my plans for your life (1). \nAnd as you receive the truth of what I am communicating to you, you will experience the lightness and joy of my revelation. You will not desire to edit my messages. You will not attempt to reconstitute aspects you do not like, but will eat the scroll, and digest what I am giving you (2).\nAnd as a result you will be able to hear more clearly, for the self-created noise will be reduced. Over the course of time, you will no longer be clouded by your own thoughts, feelings, fears, and other voices that influence your hearing. You will know my voice, and will listen to me, and will receive what I am saying. This is my promise to you. This is the hope I offer to you, that you will hear me clearly, and regularly. This is the hope I offer you, that you will know my heart for you, and that you will realize we are one, bonded together in the unity of my spirit (3).\nIn this hope you will emerge courageous, for as you come to know not only who I truly am, but also my will, my plans, and my great power, you will no longer entertain the contamination of conventional means, but will follow my path without question, without hesitation. As you drink from the purity of my fountain, you will completely lose your taste for other sources, and as a result, will recognize my voice, and follow it solely, without reservation.\nSo do not underestimate the small advance, the small victories, the little emotions of your heart or the little thoughts on your mind, for all these point you closer to a greater understanding of who I am, if you will embrace and acknowledge them and engage with me in them. Together I will show you all the wonders of the cosmos, even the mysteries in your own heart. You will find there is no place you can escape from my presence, from my knowledge, from my power, or from my great love.

Al Franken, D-Minn., on Thursday announced he will resign amid multiple allegations that he touched women inappropriately, becoming the second lawmaker to step aside over such accusations in the last week.\nFranken said he will leave the Senate in the coming weeks. The announcement came one day after another accusation led a majority of Senate Democrats to call for his resignation.\nStriking a defiant tone in a speech on the Senate floor, Franken defended his political legacy and made clear he was not admitting to the behavior described by his accusers.\n\"Some of the allegations against me simply are not true. Others I remember very differently,\" he said.\nFranken also took at aim at President Donald Trump and Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, who have not been forced to step aside despite facing their own allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\"I of all people am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party,\" Franken said.\nDespite his misgivings, Franken said the controversy had become a distraction that would prevent him from fulfilling his duties as a senator.\n\"I know in my heart that nothing I have done as a senator - nothing - has brought dishonor on this institution,\" he said.\nHe added: \"I may be resigning my seat, but I am not giving up my voice.\"\nThe announcement comes amid a reckoning on Capitol Hill over allegations of sexual harassment against male lawmakers.\n\"Enough is enough,\" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said at a news conference on Wednesday, calling for Franken to resign. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is okay, none of it is acceptable. We as elected leaders should absolutely be held to a higher standard, not a lower standard, and we should fundamentally be valuing women. That is where this debate has to go.\"\nWhen Franken steps down, a replacement will be appointed by Minnesota's Democratic governor to serve until the 2018 election.\nFranken is expected to make his resignation effective at the end of the month, according to a person familiar with his decision, to give time for the governor and his successor to prepare. That time frame would also allow Franken to stick around for potentially consequential votes on the Republican tax bill, funding the government and potentially the fate of \"dreamers,\" immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.\nThe drive to purge Franken, coming a day after Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned under pressure in the House, was a dramatic indication of the political toxicity that has grown around the issue of sexual harassment in recent months.\nIt also stood as a stark - and deliberate - contrast with how the Republicans are handling a parallel situation in Alabama, where Moore, who will face voters in next week's special election, is accused by women of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.\nAlthough most of the alleged actions took place before he was a senator, Franken was becoming a growing liability to his party, and Republicans had seized upon the allegations against him.\nAt Moore's Tuesday night rally, conservative pundit Gina Loudon declared that Republicans did not need lectures on morality from Democrats who had struggled with their own sex scandals, and cited both Conyers and Franken.\nTrump, himself the target of multiple allegations of sexual assault, has enthusiastically endorsed Moore, and the Republican Party is once again pouring money into the race after initially pulling back. Leading Senate Republicans have also toned down their negative comments about Moore, saying his fate should be up to the voters of Alabama and - if he is elected - the Senate Ethics Committee.\nDemocrats said they agreed with Franken's decision and called on Republicans to reject members of their party facing similar accusations.\n\"Now, Republicans must join Democrats in holding their own accountable,\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said. \"The American people should take notice of national Republicans' support for a morally degraded Senate candidate in Alabama and a president in the Oval Office facing equally credible charges.\"\nThe move by Senate Democrats to oust Franken marked a dramatic turnaround in the fortunes of the onetime \"Saturday Night Live\" star. The senator from Minnesota had emerged as one of the Trump administration's sharpest foils on Capitol Hill - and as a potential 2020 presidential contender.\nOver the past three weeks, more than a half-dozen women have accused Franken of unwanted advances and touching. He apologized, saying in some cases that he had not intended to give offense and in others that he did not recall events as the women did.\nThe latest allegation against Franken came in a report published Wednesday by Politico. A former congressional aide whose name was withheld by the publication claimed that Franken had tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006, two years before his election to the Senate.\nThe woman claimed that Franken had told her, \"It's my right as an entertainer.\"\nFranken denied this allegation and said during his floor speech that while he did not believe other accusations or remember the encounters in the same way, he wanted to be sensitive to the growing national discussion over sexual harassment.\n\"I was shocked. I was upset,\" he said of the allegations against him in recent weeks. \"But in responding to their claims, I wanted to be respectful of that broader conversation because all women deserve to be heard and their experience taken seriously.\"\nFranken's alleged offenses were arguably less serious than those attributed to Moore, or to Conyers, the longest-serving member of Congress, who was accused of demanding sexual favors from the women who worked for him. Until late last week, it appeared that Franken's fellow Democrats would allow his case to work its way through the Senate Ethics Committee, a process that would take months and perhaps years to reach a resolution.\nAs recently as Nov. 26, Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., the Senate's second-ranking Democrat, argued on CNN: \"Al Franken has acknowledged what he did was wrong, and it was wrong. He has also submitted his whole case to the Senate Ethics Committee. I think that was the right thing to do. Let's have a hearing, an investigation. Let's let this really reach whatever conclusion it is going to reach, but through a due process.\"\nBut on Wednesday, Durbin expressed no such forbearance. \"Senator Franken's conduct was wrong. He has admitted to it. And he should resign from the Senate.\"\nEven as Senate Democrats expressed support publicly for leaving Franken's fate in the hands of the Ethics Committee, his female colleagues were increasingly unsettled as new accusers went public.\n\"People were at the edge of their patience with this. They'd had enough. One more allegation was going to be it,\" said one senior aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations.\nAnother said female Democratic senators had been discussing it among themselves \"on the Senate floor, even in the ladies' room.\"\n\"Many people have been talking about this for some time,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said. \"It wasn't coordinated. It just happened.\"\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who has served in the Senate longer than most of her female colleagues, said it was \"significant that the women on his side of the aisle led the way\" and added that she believed the latest allegation was \"in some ways the final straw for people.\"\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., who had stood by his friend in the wake of the allegations, called Franken after the Politico story broke early Wednesday and told him directly he had to resign, according to a person familiar with the call, who added that this came before other senators began calling for him to step down.\nSchumer also met with Franken and his wife at the leader's apartment early Wednesday afternoon to discuss resigning. The session ended without a firm commitment from Franken to do so, said the person, who was granted anonymity to speak frankly about the private exchange.\nIn recent days - before Wednesday's report - Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who has known Franken for nearly two decades, had also told Franken he needed to step down, aides familiar with their discussions said. On Wednesday, Warren issued a short public statement, saying, \"I think he should resign.\"\nFranken had staved off public calls for his ouster last week, according to a person who has been in touch with the senator and his staff in recent days.\nThere was a \"mad rush\" last week to call on Franken to resign when more allegations surfaced, said the person, who was granted anonymity to speak frankly about private discussions. \"I think that people were talked off the ledge at that point and wanted to recollect and figure out if the Senate Ethics investigation should just move forward.\"\nBut, \"I'm pretty sure that Al should have known that if there was another story that came out that there'd be a mass exodus away from him.\"\nOutside the chamber, growing numbers of Democrats had been making the case that it was untenable for Franken to remain in the Senate if their party hoped to maintain the high ground on the issue.\nAmong those calling for Franken to step down was Doug Jones, Moore's Democratic opponent in Alabama.\nAnd though she did not mention Franken by name, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had declared a policy of \"zero tolerance\" when she called last week for Conyers to leave the House. On Wednesday, Pelosi declared that she was \"very proud of the fact that people are taking this matter head on and are trusting women who come forward, [and] what they have to say.\"\n  Politics Washington Post", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "franken", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leeann tweeden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john conyers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "politico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruben kihuen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy klobuchar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buzzfeed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patty murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juliet linderman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay reeves", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate ethics committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota state fair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffington post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-nev.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-mich.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:01.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c8d6eff36cdebce5fae3ce57fca6afef74f80d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJ8O36ZYoSljQUp8gfuGVzC4Q1RxoNt4KVh6d_wtMykqYzhqTW4Ja_zr1kMUFIZcEM", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Tools/N-5yc1vZcb51/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "HDX Terry Towels (60-Pack)-7-660", "title_full": "HDX Terry Towels (60-Pack)-7-660 -

FOX Carolina 21 Member Center: Flake out: Light snow could fall in some Gulf states Friday Posted: Updated: \nJACKSON, Miss. (AP) - Snow in the Deep South? Maybe a little. \nNational Weather Service meteorologists say rain might get cold and heavy enough to become snow before dawn Friday in a band beginning west of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Snow mixed with rain is predicted Friday across Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and into western South Carolina. \nNo snow is expected in New Orleans or coastal areas south of Interstate 10. \nSome roads and overpasses could see spotty icing, but warm ground temperatures probably mean snow accumulating only on grass. Somewhat heavier snow is predicted in a few north Georgia areas. \nStill, emergency personnel are preparing. In Mississippi's Hancock County, Emergency Management Director Brian Adam is warning drivers to beware. \nSome areas of Alabama and the Florida Panhandle could see a second snow chance Friday night.

I commend you for the vital work you do in shining the spotlight on corruption in Europe and around the world.\nThis conference is looking at a pervasive issue, which despite some undeniable progress, continues to be a major problem for our political systems and, ultimately, our societies.\nIn the current challenging context, with public confidence in our democratic institutions under pressure, there is an even greater responsibility on politicians and public officials to ensure that they are beyond reproach in how they conduct themselves in office. At the same time, the public is being constantly confronted with new examples, which raise serious questions.\nRecent revelations in relation to large scale tax avoidance have revealed examples not only of 1000s of private individuals and companies but also of some prominent politicians and public officials who have managed their finances in a manner that can be considered ethically questionable at best. In some of the cases, the perception of conflicts of interests appears unavoidable.\nEU level action on corruption Since the Commission presented its Anti-Corruption Communication in 2011, the EU\u2019s report card has been mixed.\nThe EU Anti-Corruption Report, which emerged as a central action from that Communication, assessed the state of play in the Member States and made concrete recommendations on how to address issues identified. While somewhat undermined by the failure to assess the EU institutions themselves, the report was nonetheless an important concrete initiative on corruption at EU level.\nUnfortunately, what was supposed to have been a biannual initiative has essentially been discontinued, to be replaced by some ad hoc reporting under the \u2018European Semester\u2019. This tends to undermine at least the perception of the EU\u2019s commitment to such a crucial issue.\nThe Commission\u2019s 2011 commitment to ensuring that the EU becomes a member of GRECO , the Council of Europe\u2019s anti-corruption monitoring body is also not yet delivered on.\nThat said, there are encouraging recent developments. The proposals by the Commission to strengthen EU anti-money laundering rules , in the aftermath of the Panama Papers leak, were timely, particularly the provisions to make public, registers of the beneficial owners of companies. Unfortunately, some of these proposals are reportedly being blocked at Council level.\nMy hope is that, by addressing the opaque nature of decision-making in the Council, my inquiry launched this year into Council transparency will help to encourage all EU governments to defend legislation in the public interest in the future or at least allow the public to see where responsibility actually lies for the failure to move on these matters. Indeed, we have just extended the timeline on our public consultation on this issue until the end of the year, which is available on my website to anyone who is concerned about or who has views on how the Council handles access to documents issues.\nAs European Ombudsman, my mission is, essentially, to serve democracy by working with the EU institutions to create a more effective, accountable, transparent and ethical administration. There is a pervasive perception that the EU institutions are opaque and unaccountable. This narrative, which has been stoked in the current climate of Euro-scepticism, is misleading at best. Overall, the EU administration has higher ethical and transparency standards than most Member State administrations. The Juncker Commission has made real advances in several areas of good administration. Observe for example\u200a\u2014\u200aat least in this phase of the Brexit talks\u200a\u2014\u200athe contrasting levels of transparency as between the EU and the United Kingdom.\nWe have certainly come a long way since OLAF was set up in the aftermath of the corruption scandals that shook the Commission. The imminent creation of the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office is intended to complement OLAF\u2019s mission to tackle fraud and corruption at EU level.\nThe growing competences of EU agencies of Europol and Eurojust also bring EU added-value to the fight against corruption in the Member States, as Europol\u2019s role in the investigation into the murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia\u2019s murder has made clear this week.\nNevertheless, in the current challenging context, it is all the more important to ensure the EU institutions and prominent public officials promote the highest standards of transparency and ethics in office. As well as dealing with complaints, I can also conduct inquiries on my own initiative. When I was elected, I said that I would strategically use this power to investigate systemic problems in the EU administration. Today, I will touch upon some of the issues I have chosen to focus on, with a view to promoting integrity and ethical conduct within the EU institutions.\nStrategic inquiry on Whistleblowing One of the first strategic inquiries I launched concerned whistleblowing. While the word evokes political intrigue, the day-to-day reality is often far removed from the type of revelations in the Panama Papers or that brought down the Santer Commission.\nThe challenge for the EU institutions, and equally for national administrations, is to develop structures not only to protect people who, in good faith, speak up about serious irregularities, but also to ensure that the substance of their complaint is fully investigated and that the whistleblowers are kept informed of what action will be taken to rectify the situation.\nIn the context of a review of the EU Staff Regulations, all EU institutions and agencies were supposed to adopt internal rules on whistleblowing. As part of my inquiry, I asked nine EU institutions what they were doing to this end. To lead by example, my office drew up our own internal whistleblowing rules and invited interested parties to comment. I am pleased to report that all nine institutions covered by my inquiry have now adopted or updated their whistleblowing rules.\nRevolving doors / Commissioners\u2019 Code of Conduct Another complex challenge concerns the rules and procedures the Commission has in place to prevent conflicts of interest regarding current Commissioners, as well as the activities of ex-Commissioners after they have left office. This includes the \u201crevolving doors\u201d phenomenon, when they leave the EU institutions for the private sector (or vice versa) creating a possible conflict of interest.\nPublic trust can be undermined by perceptions that Commissioners or senior public officials are influenced by potential future jobs or use inside information and networks to benefit the private interests of a new employer. Following a number of complaints, I conducted an inquiry about a paid position held by a former EU Commissioner. I concluded that the Barroso Commission had failed adequately to deal with the former Commissioner\u2019s breach of the Code of Conduct despite concerns having been raised by the Ad Hoc Ethical Committee, the body that deals with these matters. I proposed that the Commission revise the Commissioners\u2019 Code of Conduct to include sanctions for any breach of obligations by a serving or former Commissioner.\nI also dealt with former Commission President Barroso\u2019s appointment to Goldman Sachs, a move that generated significant public concern at a very challenging time for the EU. I wrote to President Juncker asking him to explain what measures the Commission had taken to check whether Mr Barroso\u2019s actions conform to the ethics obligations in place.\nIn September this year, the Commission announced plans for a much more detailed Code of Conduct for Commissioners, including the some of the suggestions I had made. Crucially, the Commission has proposed to extend the cooling off period for Commissioners from 18 months to 2 years for former Commissioners and 3 years for former Commission Presidents. This was a welcome development.\nHowever we will, of course, assess the effectiveness of these proposals once they are fully operational. We will also continue to draw attention to some of the outstanding issues, most significantly the need to enforce the treaty obligations of integrity and discretion, and for a more independent ethics committee.\nLobbying transparency Lobbying transparency is another important issue that we are following of course, notably as regards the \u2018EU Transparency Register\u2019 for lobbyists. It is essential that this register, which the Commission has agreed to revise, becomes really mandatory in the future for all interest representatives, and this includes having full transparency on the funding of interest groups. It is also important I feel that the wide scope of the Register is retained, and not narrowed to only direct interactions between the EU institutions and lobbyists. This is something I know the Parliament is also concnered about in the upcoming talks.\nNegotiations between the three main institutions are about to start and I understand the Council has recently adopted its mandate to enter those talks. I wish the three institutions well, and hope a revised Transparency Register can be agreed before 2019.\nOther relevant issues we are looking into, or have looked into include:\n- wider issues of conflicts of interests with various EU institutions and agencies;\n- problems with the Commission\u2019s expert groups ;\n- the role of so-called \u2018special advisers\u2019 who provide advice to Commissioners on specific policy areas;\nWhile my role is typically to focus on what is wrong, it is important to point out again that the standards set by the EU administration often go beyond those of many EU Member States. And in my experience, EU officials are determined to act with integrity and in the public interest . For example, it was a group of motivated EU staff that was among the most prominent voices leading the calls for action on the Barroso affair.

According to Chad Sanderson, Subway's Experience Optimization Matter, all data should be guided by a singular \u2018North Star\u2019 metric. Author Date published December 6, 2017 Categories Ecommerce \nWhen you think of ecommerce, lunch is probably not the first thing that comes to mind. But in today\u2019s world, where our smartphones are rarely out of arm\u2019s reach, people purchase pretty much every product online. Including sandwiches. \nSubway, the world\u2019s largest restaurant chain with nearly 45,000 locations worldwide, certainly understands this. Chad Sanderson, Experience Optimization Manager at Subway, recently spoke on a ClickZ Masterclass about conversion rate optimization and A/B testing, which Subway uses to better understand its enormous customer base. \n\u201cOur audience is so massive that we have a lot of segments and data. How can we use them to give people the best possible experience?\u201d says Sanderson. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the crux of optimization and personalization: There\u2019s not just one user who visits the website. Everyone has different behaviors so it\u2019s virtually impossible to understand why one particular person is doing something. The point of testing is looking at larger groups.\u201d \nThe webinar may have only been an hour long, but our conversation with Sanderson continued. Read on to learn about Subway\u2019s \u201c metric that matters ,\u201d what question you should ask yourself, and how to create a representative sample when your audience is\u2026 well, everyone. ClickZ : Subway isn\u2019t a brand that naturally seems to lend itself to ecommerce. How does CRO play into your strategy? \nChad Sanderson: In the [quick service restaurant] industry, more and more people are ordering online and then picking up in-store. We want to have an optimization program in place that makes that process very easy. It\u2019s been great for us\u2014it\u2019s efficient for customers and when they use a mobile app, they have to sign up. Now we have more information about people, which gives us a better understanding of them , as opposed to the people who go to the store and use cash that we know nothing about. CZ: During our webinar, you mentioned that finding \u201cthe metrics that matter\u201d should center on the metric that matters. What is Subway\u2019s? \nCS: There are a few: the number of purchasers, revenue per visitor, and elements of loyalty and time. We don\u2019t want to just maximize what people are buying right now; we want to maximize how frequently they come back over weeks and weeks. Our \u2018metric that matters\u2019 is a combination of all of those elements that\u2019s kind of our North Star. \nThere\u2019s such a huge amount of data that when you don\u2019t have some sort of guiding force that works as an anchor, it becomes absolute chaos. There are a lot of proxy metrics that only sound like improvements, but don\u2019t improve the \u2018North Star.\u2019 \u201cLet\u2019s optimize time on-site\u201d may sound good, for example, but sometimes the number of items people add to their bag increases while the checkout amount doesn\u2019t. CZ: The majority of our webinar attendees aren\u2019t satisfied with their website conversion rates. What can they learn from Subway? \nCS: Subway is a massive brand that people have affinity for, so it\u2019s easier to have better conversion rates, regardless of our user experience. But what we do is ask ourselves, \u201cWhat is a good conversion rate for me ?\u201d I think that in general, there\u2019s too much of a focus on the industry average and how much higher that number should be. The focus should be about understanding what is an optimal space for your business. CZ: Your name and brand recognition brings up a good point. When you\u2019re testing, how do you come up with a representative sample of your audience when your audience is so big? \nCS: The good thing about statistics is that it\u2019s really broad and all-encompassing, and can always be molded to fit the sample size. It\u2019s convenient for Subway because when you have a larger the sample size, you can make very specific inferences and you don\u2019t have to make them off a huge amount of your proportional traffic. We can also infer something in a much smaller time interval, rather than saying, \u201cWe need to get people in here for a month first.\u201d CZ: Smartphones obviously represent a huge change in consumer behavior. How has that impacted your CRO strategy? \nCS: The move to mobile is gaining traction every day, but there\u2019s still a contingent of very strong desktop users we can\u2019t forget about. Even though the number of desktop users decreases all the time, you can\u2019t neglect the desktop experience in favor of the mobile experience because people often start on desktop and move to mobile. The individual channel matters less than the multi-channel experience .

Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test", "text": "WASHINGTON -- A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray - and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer.\nIt's the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year?\nThe issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat - overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment.\nThat trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms - known scientifically as \"tomosynthesis\" - with standard two-dimensional digital mammography.\nThe 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers.\n\"But the idea isn't so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\" said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most.\nIt's one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices.\n\"The most important thing about this study is that it's moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\" predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n\"We are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\"\nWHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM?\nThat depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.)\nThe American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40.\nThe American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram.\nAnd the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening.\nWHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS?\nStandard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles - not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they're not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer.\nSome studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they're often advertised as particularly useful for younger women's dense breasts.\nHOW TO DECIDE?\nUnderstand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer.\nBreast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women's breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image.\nConsider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death - but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening - that overdiagnosis problem.\nAs for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost.\nTHE NEW STUDY\nAbout 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They'll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don't have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year.\nResearchers will track every woman's results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare. The giant database hopefully will help them tease out more information about which women benefit most from what type and frequency of screening.\n\"Mammography has been provocative over many decades. It's important that women have a better understanding of how mammography is important for them based upon their age and other risk factors,\" said McCaskill-Stevens.\n___\nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

(AP) - The Latest on the federal sentencing of a white former South Carolina officer who pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights violation in the shooting death of an unarmed black motorist (all times local): \n6:45 p.m. \nClosing arguments have wrapped up in the federal sentencing trial of a former South Carolina police office facing prison time for the shooting of an unarmed motorist. \nAttorneys for Michael Slager reiterated their argument that the officer was afraid, not malicious, when he shot Walter Scott five times in the back following an April 2015 traffic stop. \nFederal prosecutor Jared Fishman said Slager changed his story of what happened multiple times and wasn't justified in shooting Scott. \nA judge is deciding whether Scott's shooting was murder or manslaughter. The former North Charleston officer faces a possible life sentence, although federal officials have recommended far less. Scott's youngest son on Wednesday asked a judge to levy the harshest possible sentence. \nCourt will reconvene Thursday morning at 10 a.m. Both sides are expected to call witnesses to give statements on the impact the shooting has had on them and weigh in on a possible sentence. \n6 p.m. \nA lawyer for a former South Carolina police officer says there's no question his client committed a crime when he shot a fleeing, unarmed motorist in the back five times. \nAndy Savage said during his closing argument Wednesday that Michael Slager's shooting of Walter Scott constituted voluntary manslaughter, not murder. Federal prosecutors argue the shooting was murder, saying earlier Wednesday that Slager was calm and calculating when he shot Scott five times in the back. \nSavage also countered the government's assertion that Slager changed his story about the shooting multiple times, saying his client gave consistent statements to officers at the scene of the April 2015 shooting as well as to state police agents several days later. \nA judge is mulling how much time Slager should spend in federal prison for violating Scott's civil rights. \n5 p.m. \nFederal prosecutors have made their final argument as to why a white former South Carolina officer's shooting of a fleeing back motorist was murder. \nJared Fishman said during closing arguments Wednesday that Michael Slager unnecessarily shot \"a man who was running away\" five times in the back after a traffic stop, something far outside standard operating procedure for police work. \nFishman said Walter Scott didn't comply with Slager's commands to stop, but that doesn't justify shooting him. \nA judge charged with sentencing Slager on a federal civil rights conviction must first decide if the April 2015 shooting of Walter Scott was second-degree murder, as the government argues, or voluntary manslaughter. \nSlager's attorneys are expected to argue that they believe the shooting was manslaughter, which would mean a lesser sentence for Slager. \nHe faces a possible life sentence, although federal authorities have recommended far less. \n4:40 p.m. \nThe mother of a black motorist shot by a white South Carolina police officer says she told her son to comply with Michael Slager's demands \"so there wouldn't be any trouble.\" \nJudy Scott testified Wednesday that she was on the phone with her son Walter Scott when Slager pulled him over for a traffic stop in April 2015. \nJudy Scott also said she didn't hear her son say any curse words during their call. Slager's attorneys put up a forensic audio and video expert who says a microphone on Slager's uniform picked up Scott saying, \"F--k the police\" after Slager asked him to get on the ground. \n4:20 p.m. \nAn expert who examined a stun gun used by a white former South Carolina police officer on a fleeing black motorist says the weapon could have been dangerous after its initial deployment. \nDarko Babic (dar-KO bah-BIK) testified Wednesday he examined the stun gun Michael Slager fired before using his handgun to fatally shoot Walter Scott following an April 2015 traffic stop. Babic also demonstrated the use of a stun gun in court, to show the difference between the loud noise made when the probes deploy and the more muted sound the Taser makes when used in direct contact with someone's skin. \nBabic said the weapon was discharged six times the day of the shooting. \nSlager has said he shot Scott in self-defense, feeling threatened when Scott grabbed his stun gun. \n3 p.m. \nThe solicitor who brought state murder charges against a white former South Carolina officer in the shooting death of an unarmed black motorist is testifying during Michael Slager's federal sentencing. \nSolicitor Scarlett Wilson was called Wednesday by Slager's attorneys, who have long alleged state and federal officials unfairly teamed up on their client. Wilson says she had interacted with federal officials but couldn't recall specific contacts and hadn't planned prosecutorial decisions with them. \nLast year, a state jury deadlocked in Slager's state murder trial, and that charged was dropped as part of his federal guilty plea in May to violating Scott's civil rights. \nSlager is facing up to a year in prison. Earlier Wednesday, Scott's youngest son asked a judge to sentence Slager to life, although federal officials have recommended 10 to nearly 13 years. \n1 p.m. \nA former supervisor says a South Carolina police officer followed procedures during the shooting of an unarmed black motorist in 2015. \nWade Humphries testified Wednesday that former North Charleston officer Michael Slager followed proper protocols in his encounter with Walter Scott during and after a traffic stop. \nHumphries had been Slager's supervisor when the officer worked the night shift before switching to daytime duty. He helped demonstrate how officers are trained to disarm anyone with a weapon and said Slager acted appropriately. \nSlager is facing federal sentencing this week for violating Scott's civil rights. Earlier Wednesday, Scott's youngest son asked a judge to sentence Slager to life, although federal officials have recommended 10 to nearly 13 years. \nNoon \nThe youngest son of a slain black motorist has asked a judge to levy the stiffest possible sentence against the former police officer who shot his father to death. \nMiles Scott asked a federal judge mulling how much time Michael Slager should spend in prison for \"the strongest sentence the laws allow.\" \nScott's father, Walter Scott, died in April 2015 after Slager shot him in the back five times following a traffic stop. Slager has said he shot in self-defense because he felt threatened when Scott grabbed his stun gun. \nThrough tears, clutching a framed photograph of his father, Miles Scott said he has had trouble sleeping and misses watching football games with his dad. \nSlager is being sentenced this week for violating Scott's civil rights. He faces a possible life sentence, although federal officials have recommended 10 to nearly 13 years. \n10:30 a.m. \nThe sentencing hearing for a white former South Carolina law officer facing federal prison time for violating the civil rights of an unarmed black motorist is entering its third day. \nThe proceedings for Michael Slager could wrap up Wednesday. Thus far, prosecutors and defense attorneys have put up more than half a dozen witnesses, several of whom have analyzed video and audio recordings of the April 2015 shooting death of Walter Scott. \nSlager has been in jail since pleading guilty in May to violating Scott's civil rights. He faced murder charges in state court, but a jury in that case deadlocked last year, and the charges were dropped as part of his federal plea deal. \nSlager faces a possible life sentence, although federal officials have recommended 10 to nearly 13 years in prison. His attorneys argue the 36-year-old Slager should face far less time. \n4:20 a.m. \nA year ago, former South Carolina police officer Michael Slager heard a judge declare a mistrial in the state murder case against him for shooting an unarmed black motorist to death. \nThis week, Slager sits in a federal courtroom, where a judge is considering how much time the former North Charleston officer will spend in federal prison for the shooting. \nSlager pleaded guilty in May to violating Walter Scott's civil rights, shooting the motorist in the back as he ran away. Sentencing proceedings are moving quickly, since the judge has all the state evidence. \nThe federal judge has also allowed expert testimony blocked from the state trial. A forensic analyst testified Slager fought with Scott before their fatal encounter.

But there are some interesting differences between the two motorcycles. Here's the top five things that separate the two machines from each other. The TVS Apache RR 310 and BMW G310R both use the same trellis frame but the Apache's bolt-on subframe is different Frame The TVS Apache RR 310 and BMW G310R both use trellis frames that are nearly identical. There is one major difference though, which is the different rear subframe on the Apache RR 310 which has been developed by TVS to suit its purpose as a sportsbike better. Also see: TVS Apache RR 310 walkaround video The engines on the Apache RR 310 and G310R are identical but TVS uses its own custom ECU for better responses ECU In terms of technology and hardware, the 313cc, -cylinder engine powering the TVS Apache RR 310 is identical to the BMW G310R's, but TVS Motor has gone in for its own custom ECU to offer better engine and throttle responses, given its more aggressive positioning as compared to the G310R. The fully-faired Apache RR 310 is positioned as a sportbike, also meant for commuting and touring Purpose While the G310R is BMW Motorrad's smallest motorcycle yet, the Apache RR 310 is TVS Motor's largest motorcycle yet and also its new flagship product. That aside there is a big difference between their purposes too. The G310R is positioned as a naked motorcycle meant primarily for street riding and commuting, while the Apache RR 310 is a faired sportsbike intended to be ridden on track, apart from being used for commuting and touring as well. Gearing Both motorcycles use the same six-speed gearbox but different from the G310R's. larger rear sprocket, with 41 teeth, as opposed to the 40 toothed one on the G310R to improve the motorcycle's initial grunt. A larger rear sprocket also means a lower top end, but that's where the aerodynamics of the Apache RR 310 come into play, as the TVS boasts a higher top speed. Also see: TVS Apache RR 310 first ride review Fairing The biggest visual differentiator between the Apache RR 310 and the G310R is the fairing on the TVS. full fairing given its positioning as a sportsbike, and TVS Motor claims the motorcycle has been tested extensively in a wind tunnel and on an air strip to G310R on the other hand does not get any wind protection at all, being a naked.",

I have a pretty simple setup, with a Freesat box, PS4 and a chrome cast, all of which are directly connected via good quality HDMI cables to the AVR. TV signal defaults to pass through when off. There are outputs to my TV and PJ via HDMI. I have the AVR set to allow audio to output to both the TV and via the surround speakers (5.1). All seemed to be working fine, but somehow I've messed up a setting, or the amp has developed a fault, as the only signal I am getting from the PS4 is stereo. When I bring up the on screen display of input/output signals I can see its receiving PCM but it's not decoding into 5.1 etc. I'm currently watching a steamed TV show via the chromecast and it is outputting in 5.0 (I have the sub option switched off as I'm using large-ish fronts. Therefore the issue seems to be PS4 based. I'm aware that there are issues with PS4 signals getting decoded, but it worked perfectly before ( I've been away working overseas) but since I've been back its not worked properly. I am having the same results from bluray, Amazon Prime streaming and whilst gaming. I have tried both outputting PCM (so the amp is decoding) and setting the PS4 to output a Dolby signal (as I understand it this should send a decoded signal to the AVR) but nothing is working. I've been going through the menus trying to work out what might be affecting it, but I just can't suss it out! I'm going crazy now - I'm finding Onkyos manuals useless at describing what functions really do - and I'm stumbling around the menus feeling a bit lost now!! Please help - it's sucking my will to live... Well, just as well I managed to eventually work it out myself then I guess....if you set the amp to pass audio to both tv and surround it only outputs stereo. Which is utterly rubbish, as you can't use any connected equipment without using your speakers instead of TV audio. Like most people, I don't want to output to my surround system 100% of the time... Has anyone else experienced this? It's ridiculous and utterly defeats the object of being able to output an audio signal to the tv. Does this mean the only way to output to the TV without this problem is to establish it as a second zone? Or could I use some kind of secondary audio connections other than hdmi? Click to expand... How do you expect a source to output audio that is compatible with both your AV receiver's and your TV's audio capabilities? The reason you only get stereo is because your TV hasn't the multichannel audio capabilities associated with your receiver. HDMI uses the least capable device to access and determine what format a source can output. In your case the TV is used to determine what the source can output. It is commonly suggested to not passthrough audio via HDMI for this very reason. Actually you can passthrough audio along with video without this effect if in standby. The receiver has an HDMI passthrough in standby function. This setting would allow you to passthrough any HDMI source connected to the receiver while the receiver is in standby and does not require that you set the HDMI audio to AVR + TV. If not wanting to use your receiver then simply enable the HDMI passthrough in standby function onboard the AV receiver and put it in standby if and when you'd rather be using the TV's speakers. I'd personally suggest not using the TV's speakers ever and can't see why you'd use them rather than the AV receiver and the speakers connected to it? There's no advantage to be gained by using the TV's own speakers. And by the way, no matter how large your speakers, use the sub! Your speakers are not full range and cannot handle the lower frequencies associated with the LFE channel. They probably can't fully output the lower frequencies associated with a aweful lot of regulat stereo content? You should never dissable the sub and force the LFE channel through the front speakers. Doing this increases the risk of actually damaging the front speakers. There's absolutely no advantage to forcing these frequencies out of the front speakers. I'd suggest you reactivate the sub, assign all your speakers as being SMALL and set appropriate crossovers for them to use. AS to the PS4. It has nothing to do with setting it to output Dolby Digital. The setting you need to change first is the HDMI audio output setting. This should be set to bitstream. Additionally, there's a quirk with the PS4 than also requires you to enter the options while playing a Blu-ray disc and go into the AUDIO FORMAT settings. In these settings select BITSTREAM (DIRECT). The console will remember this seetting for all future Blu-rays until you change it to another option. The PS4 will now output the audio for the receiver to decode in association with Blu-ray discs.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:09.051+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "97bc8628f791671a07b97625a455a08034783e81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgywVLuxr5EIWl5zHMxfILsRg94KdgiD8KeEYxdCkqzRtH9EpR9VLzvQdFXqOG5T2g4tj52An.3PHA--", "site_full": "forum.luminous-landscape.com", "site": "luminous-landscape.com", "site_section": "http://forum.luminous-landscape.com/index.php?board=34.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Computers &amp; Peripherals", "title": "Operating system security vulnerabilities", "title_full": "Operating system security vulnerabilities", "published": "2017-12-06T18:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 42978, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "98255399cdcfbf259fe2283ca79dae13b1c13d66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgywVLuxr5EIWl5zHMxfILsRg94KdgiD8KeEYxdCkqzRtH9EpR9VLzvQdFXqOG5T2g5ws_3ERZjpu5Vp75wdEi6s", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "BJL", "published": "2017-12-06T18:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: from: plugsnpixels on December 03, 2017, 04:14:58 PM Here's an interesting site I discovered yesterday, listing past and current security vulnerabilities for various operating systems.\nI would like a list that excludes vulnerabilities that rely on \"user error\", meaning downloading and running dodgy software from sources other than a curated app store\u0097particularly if the attack also requires running that malware in an account with admin privileges.\nAlso, the paucity of Linux vulnerabilities sounds like a consequence of relatively low interest in attacking Linux, due to its far lower number of user who are both \"unsavvy\" and have admin privileges.

This number is estimated to rise to 2.5 billion cows by 2050. Scientists say a single cow can release up to 120kg of methane per year, which is being classed as bad for the environment as it is over 20 times more harmful than carbon dioxide. Emissions are higher than estimated \nWith agriculture reported to be responsible for 18% of the total release of greenhouse gases, there is a big drive to reduce the amount of methane produced by cows, and one company seems to have a solution. Scientists have developed a natural animal feed supplement made from fruit and vegetables that can reduce methane emissions from ruminants and possibly reduce the use of antibiotics. Over the past number of years the additive called Mootral has been developed by UK researchers funded by the Swiss led life science group Zaluvida, in conjunction with leading European universities. \nScientists believe that global methane emissions produced by livestock are higher than estimated hence the drive to find a solution to the problem. Although there has been no scalable solution to reduce methane emissions from cows, the researchers claim Mootral can reduce them by at least 30%. Scientists say a single cow can release up to 120kg of methane per year, which is being classed as bad for the environment as it is over 20 times more harmful than carbon dioxide. Photo: Shutterstock Based on natural plant flavonoids \nMootral uses natural ingredients such as organosulphurous compounds from garlic and natural plant flavonoids, including citric extracts, in lieu of synthetic products in feed, to improve rumen fermentation. The supplement works by suppressing the methanogenic bacteria present in the rumen, while leaving bacteria that aids in digestion intact. \nAs an extra benefit, Mootral\u2019s natural plant flavonoids are known to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, which the company says could help reduce reliance on antibiotics. Jamie Newbold, director of research and enterprise, Professor of Animal Science at Aberystwyth University and member of the Mootral Scientific Advisory Board of the Zaluvida Group said: \u201cWhat is unique with Mootral is that we have taken the original concept of plant extracts and moved it forward and that the effects are repeatable and reliable and highly potent.\u201d Sustainable solution \nThe researchers say that by enhancing the value of organic and regional products, Mootral offers consumers the choice to help the environment while they continue to enjoy beef and dairy. This is also crucial, since cows play an important role in transforming biomass, such as grass, into valuable nutrients to feed a growing human population. Zaluvida\u2019s group CEO Christoph Staeuble said: \u201cI am delighted to present real beef from real cows that are no longer big polluters. \u201cAt a time when agriculture must feed more people every month, climate-friendly beef and dairy guarantees a sustainable solution to greenhouse gas emissions - with beef and dairy that is 100% authentic.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jamie newbold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zaluvida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christoph staeuble", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mootral scientific advisory board of the zaluvida group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberystwyth university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zaluvida", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mootral", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:22:09.086+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e859d63b3bbfaf5e9ac2d5e50307b1812110f34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU444KZ0DOqIksauKG73GPUkPB18UkY5y09kx1tQZJb7_Bowd_nMSPSjQf9O1dmQt9U4HSWJAswE1Tkaz4VnsTSAWDnNJ924ctTE-", "site_full": "laonikos13galanis.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://laonikos13galanis.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "akeratos of Delphi", "title": "Stones, Metals and Gems", "title_full": "Stones, Metals and Gems", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6e859d63b3bbfaf5e9ac2d5e50307b1812110f34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU444KZ0DOqIksauKG73GPUkPB18UkY5y09kx1tQZJb7_Bowd_nMSPSjQf9O1dmQt9U4HSWJAswE1Tkaz4VnsTSAWDnNJ924ctTE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nikos Galanis (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "Stones, Metals and Gems", "text": "\n\nEACH of the four primary elements as taught by the early philosophers has its analogue in the quaternary terrestrial constitution of man. The rocks and earth correspond to the bones and flesh; the water to the various fluids; the air to the gases; and the fire to the bodily heat. Since the bones are the framework that sustains the corporeal structure, they may be regarded as a fitting emblem of the spirit--that divine foundation which supports the composite fabric of mind, soul, and body. To the initiate, the skeleton of death holding in bony fingers the reaper's scythe denotes Saturn (Kronos), the father of the gods, carrying the sickle with which he mutilated Ouranos, his own sire. In the language of the Mysteries,  the spirits of men are the powdered bones of Saturn . The latter deity was always worshiped under the symbol of the base or footing, inasmuch as he was considered to be the substructure upholding creation. The myth of Saturn has its historical basis in the fragmentary records preserved by the early Greeks and Ph\u015bnicians concerning a king by that name who ruled over the ancient continent of Hyperborea. Polaris, Hyperborea, and Atlantis, because they lie buried beneath the continents and oceans of the modern world, have frequently been symbolized as rocks supporting upon their broad surfaces new lands, races, and empires. According to the Scandinavian Mysteries, the stones and cliffs were formed from the bones of Ymir, the primordial giant of the  seething clay , while to the Hellenic mystics the rocks were the bones of the Great Mother, G\u0107a. After the deluge sent by the gods to destroy mankind at the close of the Iron Age, only Deucalion and Pyrrha were left alive. Entering a ruined sanctuary to pray, they were directed by an oracle to depart from the temple and with heads veiled and garments unbound cast behind them the bones of their mother. Construing the cryptic message of the god to mean that the earth was the Great Mother of all creatures, Deucalion picked up loose rocks and, bidding Pyrrha do likewise, cast them behind him. From these rocks there sprang forth a new and stalwart race of human beings, the rocks thrown by Deucalion becoming men and those thrown by Pyrrha becoming women. In this allegory is epitomized the mystery of human evolution; for spirit, by ensouling matter, becomes that indwelling power which gradually but sequentially raises the mineral to the status of the plant; the plant to the plane of the animal; the animal to the dignity of man; and man to the estate of the gods. The solar system was organized by forces operating inward from the great ring of the Saturnian sphere; and since the beginnings of all things were under the control of Saturn, the most reasonable inference is that the first forms of worship were dedicated to him and his peculiar symbol--the stone. Thus the intrinsic nature of Saturn is synonymous with that spiritual rock which is the enduring foundation of the Solar Temple, and has its antitypc or lower octave in that terrestrial rock--the planet Earth--which sustains upon its jagged surface the diversified genera of mundane life. Although its origin is uncertain, litholatry undoubtedly constitutes one of the earliest forms of religious expression. \"Throughout all the world, \" writes Godfrey Higgins, \"the first object of Idolatry seems to have been a plain, unwrought stone, placed in the ground, as an emblem of the generative or procreative powers of nature.\" (See  The Celtic Druids .) Remnants of stone worship are distributed over the greater part of the earth's surface, a notable example being the menhirs at Carnac, in Brittany, where several thousand gigantic uncut stones are arranged in eleven orderly rows. Many of these monoliths stand over twenty feet out of the sand in which they are embedded, and it has been calculated that some of the larger ones weigh as much as 250,000 pounds. By some it is believed that certain of the menhirs mark the location of buried treasure, but the most plausible view is that which regards Carnac as a monument to the astronomical knowledge of antiquity. Scattered throughout the British Isles and Europe, these cairns, dolmens, menhirs, and cistvaens stand as mute but eloquent testimonials to the existence and achievements of races now extinct. Of particular interest are the rocking or logan stones, which evince the mechanical skill of these early peoples. These relics consist of enormous boulders poised upon one or two small points in such a manner that the slightest pressure will sway them, but the greatest effort is not sufficient to overthrow them. These were called  living  stones by the Greeks and Latins, the most famous one being the Gygorian stone in the Strait of Gibraltar. Though so perfectly balanced that it could be moved with the stalk of a daffodil, this rock could not be upset by the combined weight of many men. There is a legend that Hercules raised a rocking stone over the graves of the two sons of Boreas whom he had killed in combat. This stone was so delicately poised that it swayed back and forth with the wind, but no application of force could overturn it. A number of logan stones have been found in Britain, traces of one no longer standing having been discovered in Stonehenge. (See  The Celtic Druids .) It is interesting to note that the green stones forming the inner ring of Stonehenge are believed to have been brought from Africa. In many cases the monoliths are without carving or inscription, for they undoubtedly antedate both the use of tools and the art of writing. In some instances the stones have been trued into columns or obelisks, as in the runic monuments and the Hindu  lingams  and  sakti  stones; in other instances they are fashioned into rough likenesses of the human body, as in the Easter Island statues, or into the elaborately sculptured figures of the Central American Indians and the  Khmers  of Cambodia. The first rough-stone images can hardly be considered as effigies of any particular deity but rather as the crude effort of primitive man to portray in the enduring qualities of stone the procreative attributes of abstract Divinity. An instinctive recognition of the stability of Deity has persisted through all the intervening ages between primitive man and modem civilization. Ample proof of the survival of litholatry in the Christian faith is furnished by allusions to the  rock of refuge , the  rock  upon which the church of Christ was to be founded, the  corner stone  which the builders rejected, Jacob's  stony pillow  which he set up and anointed with oil, the  sling stone  of David, the  rock Moriah  upon which the altar of King Solomon's Temple was erected, the  white stone  of Revelation, and the  Rock of Ages . Stones were highly venerated by prehistoric peoples primarily because of their usefulness. Jagged bits of stone were probably man's first weapons; rocky cliffs and crags constituted his first fortifications, and from these vantage points he hurled loose boulders down upon marauders. In caverns or rude huts fashioned from slabs of rock the first humans protected themselves from the rigors of the elements. Stones were set up as markers and monuments to primitive achievement; they were also placed upon the graves of the dead, probably as a precautionary measure to prevent the depredations of wild beasts. During migrations, it was apparently customary for primitive peoples to carry about with them stones taken from their original habitat. As the homeland or birthplace of a race was considered sacred, these stones were emblematic of that universal regard shared by all nations for the place of their geniture. The discovery that fire could be produced by striking together two pieces of stone augmented man's reverence for stones, but ultimately the hitherto unsuspected world of wonders opened by the newly discovered element of fire caused pyrolatry to supplant stone worship. The dark, cold Father--stone--gave birth out of itself to the bright, glowing Son-fire; and the newly born flame, by displacing its parent, became the most impressive and mysterious of all religio-philosophic symbols, widespread and enduring through the ages. \n\nSATURN SWALLOWING THE STONE SUBSTITUTED FOR JUPITER.\n  From Catrari's  Imagini degli Dei degli Antichi . Saturn, having been warned by his parents that one of his own children would dethrone him, devoured each child at birth. At last Rhea, his wife, in order to save Jupiter, her sixth child substituted for him a rock enveloped in swaddling clothes--which Saturn, ignorant of the deception practiced upon him, immediately swallowed. Jupiter was concealed on the island of Crete until he attained manhood, when he forced his father to disgorge the five children he had eaten. The stone swallowed by Saturn in lieu of his youngest son was placed by Jupiter at Delphi, where it was held in great veneration and was daily anointed. p. 98 The  body  of every thing was likened to a rock, trued either into a cube or more ornately chiseled to form a pedestal, while the spirit of everything was likened to the elaborately carved figure surmounting it. Accordingly, altars were erected as a symbol of the lower world, and fires were kept burning upon them to represent that spiritual essence illuminating the body it surmounted. The square is actually one surface of a cube, its corresponding figure in plane geometry, and its proper philosophic symbol. Consequently, when considering the earth as an element and not as a body, the Greeks, Brahmins, and Egyptians always referred to its four corners, although they were fully aware that the planet itself was a sphere. Because their doctrines were the sure foundation of all knowledge and the first step in the attainment of conscious immortality, the Mysteries were often represented as cubical or pyramidal stones. Conversely, these stones themselves became the emblem of that condition of self-achieved godhood. The unchangeability of the stone made it an appropriate emblem of God--the immovable and unchangeable Source of Existence--and also of the divine sciences--the eternal revelation of Himself to mankind. As the personification of the rational intellect, which is the true foundation of human life, Mercury, or Hermes, was symbolized in a like manner. Square or cylindrical pillars, surmounted by a bearded head of Hermes and called herm\u0107, were set up in public places. Terminus, a form of Jupiter and god of boundaries and highways, from whose name is derived the modern word  terminal , was also symbolized by an upright stone, sometimes ornamented with the head of the god, which was placed at the borders of provinces and the intersections of important roads. The  philosopher's stone  is really the  philosophical stone , for philosophy is truly likened to a magic jewel whose touch transmutes base substances into priceless gems like itself. Wisdom is the alchemist's  powder of projection  which transforms many thousand times its own weight of gross ignorance into the precious substance of enlightenment. THE TABLETS OF THE LAW While upon the heights of Mount Sinai, Moses received from Jehovah two tablets bearing the characters of the Decalogue traced by the very finger of Israel's God. These tables were fashioned from the divine sapphire, Schethiy\u00e2, which the Most High, after removing from His own throne, had cast into the Abyss to become the foundation and generator of the worlds. This sacred stone, formed of heavenly dew, was sundered by the breath of God, and upon the two parts were drawn in black fire the figures of the Law. These precious inscriptions, aglow with celestial splendor, were delivered by the Lord on the Sabbath day into the hands of Moses, who was able to read the illumined letters from the reverse side because of the transparency of the great jewel. (See  The Secret Doctrine in Israel  or  The Zohar  for details of this legend.) The Ten Commandments are the ten shining gems placed by the Holy One in the sapphire sea of Being, and in the depths of matter the reflections of these jewels are seen as the laws governing the sublunary spheres. They are the sacred ten by which the Supreme Deity has stamped His will upon the face of Nature. This same decad was celebrated by the Pythagoreans under the form of the tetractys--that triangle of spermatic points which reveals to the initiated the whole working of the cosmic scheme; for ten is the number of perfection, the key to creation, and the proper symbol of God, man, and the universe. Because of the idolatry of the Israelites, Moses deemed the people unworthy to receive the sapphire tables; hence he destroyed them, that the Mysteries of Jehovah should not be violated. For the original set Moses substituted two tablets of rough stone into the surface of which he had cut ten ancient letters. While the former tables--partaking of the divinity of the Tree of Life--blazed forth eternal verities, the latter--partaking of the nature of the Tree of Good and Evil--revealed only temporal truths. Thus the ancient tradition of Israel returned again to heaven, leaving only its shadow with the children of the twelve tribes. One of the two tables of stone delivered by the Lawgiver to his followers stood for the oral, the other for the written traditions upon which the Rabbinical School was founded. Authorities differ widely as to the size and substance of the inferior tables. Some describe them as being so small that they could be held in the hollow of a man's hand; others declare that each table was ten or twelve cubits in length and of enormous weight. A few even deny that the tables were of stone, maintaining that they were of a wood called  sedr , which, according to the Mohammedans, grows profusely in Paradise. The two tables signify respectively the superior and the inferior worlds--the paternal and the maternal formative principles. In their undivided state they represent the Cosmic Androgyne. The breaking of the tables signifies obscurely the separation of the superior and the inferior spheres and also the division of the sexes. In the religious processionals of the Greeks and Egyptians an ark or ship was carried which contained stone tablets, cones, and vessels of various shapes emblematic of the procreative processes. The Ark of the Israelites--which was patterned after the sacred chests of the Isiac Mysteries--contained three holy objects, each having an important phallic interpretation: the pot of manna, the rod that budded, and the Tablets of the Law--the first, second, and third Principles of the Creative Triad. The manna, the blossoming staff, and the stone tables are also appropriate images respectively of the Qabbalah, the Mishna, and the written law--the spirit, soul, and body of Judaism. When placed in King Solomon's Everlasting House, the Ark of the Covenant contained only the Tablets of the Law. Does this indicate that even at that early date the secret tradition had been lost and the letter of the revelation alone remained? As representing the power that fabricated the lower, or Demiurgic, sphere, the tablets of stone were sacred to Jehovah in contradistinction to the tablets of sapphire that signified the potency that established the higher, or celestial, sphere. Without doubt the Mosaic tablets have their prototype in the stone pillars or obelisks placed on either side of the entrance to pagan temples. These columns may pertain to that remote time when men worshiped the Creator through His zodiacal sign of Gemini, the symbol of which is still the phallic pillars of the Celestial Twins. \"The Ten Commandments, writes Hargrave Jennings, \"are inscribed in two groups of five each, in columnar form. The five to the right (looking from the altar) mean the 'Law'; the five to the left mean the 'Prophets.' The right stone is masculine, the left stone is feminine. They correspond to the two disjoined pillars of stone (or towers) in the front of every cathedral, and of every temple in the heathen times.\" (See  The Rosicrucians: Their Rites and Mysteries .) The same author states that the Law is masculine because it was delivered direct from the Deity, while the Prophets, or Gospels, were feminine because born through the nature of man. The right Tablet of the Law further signifies  Jachin --the white pillar of light; the left Tablet,  Boaz --the shadowy pillar of darkness. These were the names of the two pillars cast from brass set up on the porch of King Solomon's Temple. They were eighteen cubits in height and beautifully ornamented with wreaths of chainwork, nets, and pomegranates. On the top of each pillar was a large bowl--now erroneously called a ball or globe--one of the bowls probably containing fire and the other water. The celestial globe (originally the bowl of fire), surmounting the right-hand column (Jachin), symbolized the divine man; the terrestrial globe (the bowl of water), surmounting the left-hand column (Boaz), signified the earthly man. These two pillars respectively connote also the active and the passive expressions of Divine Energy, the sun and the moon, sulphur and salt, good and bad, light and darkness. Between them is the door leading into the House of God, and standing thus at the gates of Sanctuary they are a reminder that Jehovah is both an androgynous and an anthropomorphic deity. As two parallel columns they denote the zodiacal signs of Cancer and Capricorn, which were formerly placed in the chamber of initiation to represent birth and death--the extremes of physical life. They accordingly signify the summer and the winter solstices, now known to Freemasons under the comparatively modern appellation of the \"two St. Johns.\" In the mysterious Sephirothic Tree of the Jews, these two pillars symbolize Mercy and Severity. Standing before the gate of King Solomon's Temple, these columns had the same symbolic import as the obelisks before the sanctuaries of Egypt. When interpreted Qabbalistically, the names of the two pillars mean \"In strength shall \nMOSES RECEIVING THE TABLES OF THE LAW.\n  From an old Bible. Moses Maimonides, the great Jewish Philosopher of the twelfth century, in describing the Tables of the Law written by the finger of God, divides all productions into two general orders: products of Nature and products of art. God works through Nature and man through art, he asserts in his  Guide for the Perplexed . Thus the Word of the Lord is the hand, or active principle, by which the will of the Creator is traced upon the face of His creation. The  Tannaim , or initiates of the Jewish Mystery School, alone possessed a complete understanding of the significance of the Ten Commandments. These laws are esoterically related to the ten degrees of contemplation constituting the Path of Ecstasy, which winds upward through he four worlds and ends in the effulgence of  AIN SOPH . p. 99 [paragraph continues]  My House be established. \"In the splendor of mental and spiritual illumination, the High Priest stood between the pillars as a mute witness to the perfect virtue of equilibrium--that hypothetical point equidistant from all extremes. He thus personified the divine nature of man in the midst of his compound constitution--the mysterious Pythagorean Monad in the presence of the Duad. On one side towered the stupendous column of the intellect; on the other, the brazen pillar of the flesh. Midway between these two stands the glorified wise man, but he cannot reach this high estate without first suffering upon the cross made by joining these pillars together. The early Jews occasionally represented the two pillars, Jachin and Boaz, as the legs of Jehovah, thereby signifying to the modern philosopher that Wisdom and Love, in their most exalted sense, support the whole order of creation--both mundane and supermundane. THE HOLY GRAIL Like the sapphire Schethiy\u00e2, the  Lapis Exilis , crown jewel of the Archangel Lucifer, fell from heaven. Michael, archangel of the sun and the Hidden God of Israel, at the head of the angelic hosts swooped down upon Lucifer and his legions of rebellious spirits. During the conflict, Michael with his flaming sword struck the flashing  Lapis Exilis  from the coronet of his adversary, and the green stone fell through all the celestial rings into the dark and immeasurable Abyss. Out of Lucifer's radiant gem was fashioned the Sangreal, or Holy Grail, from which Christ is said to have drunk at the Last Supper. Though some controversy exists as to whether the Grail was a cup or a platter, it is generally depicted in art as a chalice of considerable size and unusual beauty. According to the legend, Joseph of Arimathea brought the Grail Cup to the place of the crucifixion and in it caught the blood pouring from the wounds of the dying Nazarene. Later Joseph, who had become custodian of the sacred relics--the Sangreal and the Spear of Longinus--carried them into a distant country. According to one version, his descendants finally placed these relics in Glastonbury Abbey in England; according to another, in a wonderful castle on Mount Salvat, Spain, built by angels in a single night. Under the name of Preston John, Parsifal, the last of the Grail Kings, carried the Holy Cup with him into India, and it disappeared forever from the Western World. Subsequent search for the Sangreal was the motif for much of the knight errantry of the Arthurian legends and the ceremonials of the Round Table. (See the  Morte d'Arthur .) No adequate interpretation has ever been given to the Grail Mysteries. Some believe the Knights of the Holy Grail to have been a powerful organization of Christian mystics perpetuating the Ancient Wisdom under the rituals and sacraments of the oracular Cup. The quest for the Holy Grail is the eternal search for truth, and Albert G. Mackey sees in it a variation of the Masonic legend of the Lost Word so long sought by the brethren of the Craft. There is also evidence to support the claim that the story of the Grail is an elaboration of an early pagan Nature myth which has been preserved by reason of the subtle manner in which it was engrafted upon the cult of Christianity. From this particular viewpoint, the Holy Grail is undoubtedly a type of the ark or vessel in which the life of the world is preserved and therefore is significant of the body of the Great Mother--Nature. Its green color relates it to Venus and to the mystery of generation; also to the Islamic faith, whose sacred color is green and whose Sabbath is Friday, the day of Venus. The Holy Grail is a symbol both of the lower (or irrational) world and of the bodily nature of man, because both are receptacles for the living essences of the superior worlds. Such is the mystery of the redeeming blood which, descending into the condition of death, overcomes the last enemy by ensouling all substance with its own immortality. To the Christian, whose mystic faith especially emphasizes the love element, the Holy Grail typifies the heart in which continually swirls the living water of eternal life. Moreover, to the Christian, the search for the Holy Grail is the search for the real Self which, when found, is the consummation of the  magnum opus . The Holy Cup can be discovered only by those who have raised themselves above the limitations of sensuous existence. In his mystic poem,  The Vision of Sir Launfal , James Russell Lowell discloses the true nature of the Holy Grail by showing that it is visible only to a  certain state of spiritual consciousness . Only upon returning from the vain pursuit of haughty ambition did the aged and broken knight see in the transformed leper's cup the glowing chalice of his lifelong dream. Some writers trace a similarity between the Grail legend and the stories of the martyred Sun Gods whose blood, descending from heaven into the earth, was caught in the cup of matter and liberated therefrom by the initiatory rites. The Holy Grail may also be the seed pod so frequently employed in the ancient Mysteries as an emblem of germination and resurrection; and if the cuplike shape of the Grail be derived from the flower, it signifies the regeneration and spiritualization of the generative forces in man. There are many accounts of stone images which, because of the substances entering into their composition and the ceremonials attendant upon their construction, were ensouled by the divinities whom they were created to resemble. To such images were ascribed various human faculties and powers, such as speech, thought, and even motion. While renegade priests doubtless resorted to trickery--an instance of which is related in a curious apocryphal fragment entitled  Bel and the Dragon  and supposedly deleted from the end of the  Book of Daniel --many of the phenomena recorded in connection with sanctified statues and relics can hardly be explained unless the work of supernatural agencies be admitted. History records the existence of stones which, when struck, threw all who heard the sound into a state of ecstasy. There were also echoing images which whispered for hours after the room itself had become silent, and musical stones productive of the sweetest harmonies. In recognition of the sanctity which the Greeks and Latins ascribed to stones, they placed their hands upon certain consecrated pillars when taking an oath. In ancient times stones played a part in determining the fate of accused persons, for it was customary for juries to reach their verdicts by dropping pebbles into a bag. Divination by stones was often resorted to by the Greeks, and Helena is said to have foretold by lithomancy the destruction of Troy. Many popular superstitions about stones survive the so-called Dark Ages. Chief among these is the one concerning the famous black stone in the seat of the coronation chair in Westminster Abbey, which is declared to be the actual rock used by Jacob as a pillow. The black stone also appears several times in religious symbolism. It was called  Heliogabalus , a word presumably derived from  Elagabal , the Syro-Ph\u015bnician sun god. This stone was sacred to the sun and declared to possess great and diversified properties. The black stone in the Caaba at Mecca is still revered throughout the Mohammedan world. It is said to have been white originally and of such brilliancy that it could be seen many days' journey from Mecca, but as ages passed it became blackened by the tears of pilgrims and the sins of the world. THE MAGIC OF METALS AND GEMS According to the teachings of the Mysteries, the rays of the celestial bodies, striking the crystallizing influences of the lower world, become the various elements. Partaking of the astral virtues of their source, these elements neutralize certain unbalanced forms of celestial activity and, when properly combined, contribute much to the well-being of man. Little is known today concerning these magical properties, but the modern world may yet find it profitable to consider the findings of the early philosophers who determined these relationships by extensive experimentation. Out of such research arose the practice of identifying the metals with the bones of the various deities. For example, the Egyptians, according to Manetho, considered iron to be the bone of Mars and the lodestone the bone of Horus. By analogy, lead would be the physical skeleton of Saturn, copper of Venus, quicksilver of Mercury, gold of the sun, silver of the moon, and antimony of the earth. It is possible that uranium \n\nEXAMPLES OF HERM\u0106.\n  From Christie's  Disquisitions upon the Painted Greek Vases . The Primitive custom of worshiping the gods in the form of heaps of stones gave place to the practice of erecting phallic pillars, or cones, in their honor. These columns differed widely in size and appearance. Some were of gigantic proportions and were richly ornamented with inscriptions or likenesses of the gods and heroes; others--like the votive offerings of the Babylonians--were but a few inches high, without ornament, and merely bore a brief statement of the purpose for which they had been prepared or a hymn to the god of the temple in which they were placed. These small baked clay cones were identical in their symbolic meaning with the large herm\u0107 set up by the roadside and in other public places. Later the upper end of the column was surmounted by a human head. Often two projections, or tenons, corresponding to shoulders were placed, one on either side, to support the wreaths of flowers adorning the columns. Offerings, usually of food, were placed near the herm\u0107. Occasionally these columns were used to uphold roofs and were numbered among the art objects ornamenting the villas of wealthy Romans. p. 100 will prove to be the metal of Uranus and radium to be the metal of Neptune. The four  Ages  of the Greek mystics--the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age--are metaphoric expressions referring to the four major periods in the life of all things. In the divisions of the day they signify dawn, midday, sunset, and midnight; in the duration of gods, men, and universes, they denote the periods of birth, growth, maturity, and decay. The Greek Ages also bear a close correspondence to the four Yugas of the Hindus:  Krita-Yuga ,  Treta-Yuga ,  Dvapara-Yuga , and  Kali-Yuga . Their method of calculation is described by Ullamudeian as follows: \"In each of the 12 signs there are 1800 minutes; multiply this number by 12 you have 21600; e.g. 1800 X 12=21600. Multiply this 21600 by 80 and it will give 1,728,000, which is the duration of the first age, called  Krita-Yuga . If the same number be multiplied by 60, it will give 1,296,000, the years of the second age,  Treta-Yuga . The same number multiplied by 40 gives 864,000, the length of the third age,  Dvapara-Yuga . The same multiplied by 20 gives 432,000, the fourth age,  Kali-Yuga .\" (It will be noted that these multipliers decrease in inverse ratio to the Pythagorean tetractys: 1, 2, 3, and 4.) H. P. Blavatsky declares that Orpheus taught his followers how to affect a whole audience by means of a lodestone, and that Pythagoras paid particular attention to the color and nature of precious stones. She adds: \"The Buddhists assert that the sapphire produces peace of mind, equanimity, and chases all evil thoughts by establishing a healthy circulation in man. So does an electric battery, with its well-directed fluid, say our electricians. 'The sapphire,' say the Buddhists, 'will open barred doors and dwellings (for the spirit of man); it produces a desire for prayer, and brings with it more peace than any other gem; but he who would wear it must lead a pure and holy life.\"' (See  Isis Unveiled .) Mythology abounds with accounts of magical rings and talismanic jewels. In the second book of his  Republic , Plato describes a ring which, when the collet was turned in ward, rendered its wearer invisible. With this Gyges, the shepherd, secured for himself the throne of Lydia. Josephus also describes magical rings designed by Moses and King Solomon, and Aristotle mentions one which brought love and honor to its possessor. In his chapter dealing with the subject, Henry Cornelius Agrippa not only mentions the same rings, but states, upon the authority of Philostratus Jarchus, that Apollonius of Tyana extended his life to over 20 years with the aid of seven magical rings presented to him by an East Indian prince. Each of these seven rings was set with a gem partaking of the nature of one of the seven ruling planets of the week, and by daily changing the rings Apollonius protected himself against sickness and death by the intervention of the planetary influences. The philosopher also instructed his disciples in the virtues of these talismanic jewels, considering such information to be indispensable to the theurgist. Agrippa describes the preparation of magical rings as follows: \"When any Star [planet] ascends fortunately, with the fortunate aspect or conjunction of the Moon, we must take a stone and herb that is under that Star, and make a ring of the metal that is suitable to this Star, and in it fasten the stone, putting the herb or root under it-not omitting the inscriptions of images, names, and characters, as also the proper suffumigations.\" (See  Three Books of Occult Philosophy .) The ring has long been regarded as the symbol of attainment, perfection, and immortality-the last because the circlet of precious metal had neither beginning nor end. In the Mysteries, rings chased to resemble a serpent with its tail in its mouth were worn by the initiates as material evidence of the position reached by them in the order. Signet rings, engraved with certain secret emblems, were worn by the hierophants, and it was not uncommon for a messenger to prove that he was the official representative of a prince or other dignitary by bringing with his message either an impression from his master's ring or the signet itself. The wedding ring originally was intended to imply that in the nature of the one who wore it the state of equilibrium and completion had been attained. This plain band of gold therefore bore witness of the union of the Higher Self (God) with the lower self (Nature) and the ceremony consummating this indissoluble blending of Divinity and humanity in the one nature of the initiated mystic constituted the  hermetic marriage  of the Mysteries. In describing the regalia of a magician, Eliphas Levi declares that on Sunday (the day of the sun) he should carry in his right hand a golden wand, set with a ruby or chrysolite; on Monday (the day of the moon) he should wear a collar of three strands consisting of pearls, crystals, and selenites; on Tuesday (the day of Mars) he should carry a wand of magnetized steel and a ring of the same metal set with an amethyst, on Wednesday (the day of Mercury) he should wear a necklace of pearls or glass beads containing mercury, and a ring set with an agate; on Thursday (the day of Jupiter) he should carry a wand of glass or resin and wear a ring set with an emerald or a sapphire; on Friday (the day of Venus) he should carry a wand of polished copper and wear a ring set with a turquoise and a crown or diadem decorated with lapis lazuli and beryl; and on Saturday (the day of Saturn) he should carry a wand ornamented with onyx stone and wear a ring set with onyx and a chain about the neck formed of lead. (See  The Magical Ritual of the Sanctum Regnum .) Paracelsus, Agrippa, Kircher, Lilly, and numerous other magicians and astrologers have tabulated the gems and stones corresponding to the various planets and zodiacal signs. The following list has been compiled from their writings. To the sun is assigned the carbuncle, ruby, garnet---especially the pyrope--and other fiery stones, sometimes the diamond; to the moon, the pearl, selenite, and other forms of crystal; to Saturn, the onyx, jasper, topaz, and sometimes the lapis lazuli; to Jupiter, the sapphire, emerald, and marble; to Mars, the amethyst, hyacinth, lodestone, sometimes the diamond; to Venus, the turquoise, beryl, emerald, and sometimes the pearl, alabaster, coral, and carnelian; to Mercury, the chrysolite, agate, and variegated marble. To the zodiac the same authorities assigned the following gems and stones: To Aries the sardonyx, bloodstone, amethyst, and diamond; to Taurus the carnelian, turquoise, hyacinth, sapphire, moss agate, and emerald; to Gemini the topaz, agate, chrysoprase, crystal, and aquamarine; to Cancer the topaz, chalcedony, black onyx, moonstone, pearl, cat's-eye, crystal, and sometimes the emerald; to Leo the jasper, sardonyx, beryl, ruby, chrysolite, amber, tourmaline, sometimes the diamond; to Virgo the emerald, camelian, jade, chrysolite, and sometimes the pink jasper and hyacinth; to Libra the beryl, sardius, coral, lapis lazuli, opal, and sometimes the diamond; to Scorpio the amethyst, beryl, sardonyx, aquamarine, carbuncle, lodestone, topaz, and malachite; to Sagittarius die hyacinth, topaz, chrysolite, emerald, carbuncle, and turquoise; to Capricorn the chrysoprase, ruby, malachite, black onyx, white onyx, jet, and moonstone; to Aquarius the crystal, sapphire, garnet, zircon, and opal; to Pisces the sapphire, jasper, chrysolite, moonstone, and amethyst Both the magic mirror and the crystal ball are symbols little understood. Woe to that benighted mortal who accepts literally the stories circulated concerning them! He will discover--often at the cost of sanity and health--that sorcery and philosophy, while often confused, have nothing in common. The Persian Magi carried mirrors as an emblem of the material sphere which reflects Divinity from its every part. The crystal ball, long misused as a medium for the cultivation of psychical powers, is a threefold symbol: (1) it signifies the crystalline  Universal Egg  in whose transparent depths creation exists; (2) it is a proper figure of Deity previous to Its immersion in matter; (3) it signifies the \u0107theric sphere of the world in whose translucent essences is impressed and preserved the perfect image of all terrestrial activity. Meteors, or  rocks from heave n, were considered tokens of divine favor and enshrined as evidence of a pact between the gods and the community in which they fell. Curiously marked or chipped natural stones are occasionally found. In China there is a slab of marble the grain of which forms a perfect likeness of the Chinese dragon. The Oberammergau stone, chipped by Nature into a close resemblance to the popular conception of the face of Christ, is so remarkable that even the crowned heads of Europe requested the privilege of beholding it. Stones of such nature were held in the highest esteem among primitive peoples and even today exert a wide influence upon the religiously-minded. \n\nTHE PYTHAGOREAN SIGNET RING.\n  From Cartari's  Imagini degli Dei degli Antichi . The number five was peculiarly associated by the Pythagoreans with the art of healing, and the pentagram, or five-pointed star, was to them the symbol of health. The above figure represents a magical ring set with a talismanic gem bearing the  pentalpha , or star formed by five different positions of the Greek  Alpha . On this subject Mackey writes: \"The disciples of Pythagoras, who were indeed its real inventors, placed within each of its interior angles one of the letters of the Greek word \u03a5\u0393\u0395\u0399\u0391, or the Latin one  SALUS , both of which signify health; and thus it was made the talisman of health.
