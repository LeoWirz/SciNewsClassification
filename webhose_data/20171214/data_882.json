SEO for Expert Content \nLet\u2019s start with SEO. We\u2019ve already laid out the solid ground for this when we collected keywords and based our work on them. There are still a number of things to keep in mind: Not Mobile-First? No Leads \nSome of our travel projects receive 80 percent of their traffic from mobile phones and tablets. That \u201cmobile-first\u201d mantra has been here for half of a decade, but thousands of e-commerce websites are still not optimized for mobile viewing. Don\u2019t be like them, make your article mobile-first. \nThat means readable fonts, full-width images, and no horizontal scrolling (pretty please). In addition to making it easier for your clients to read the text, it\u2019ll help you rank higher compared to your desktop-only competitors. AMP Is Good, Especially for Articles \nConsider implementing the AMP standard . Google is obsessed with page loading speed, and while being AMP-ready is not a ranking signal yet, my hunch is that the resulting customer satisfaction already is. Internal Linking Still Rules \nFor many competitive keywords, we\u2019ve been able to rank pretty high just because of using a sane internal linking scheme . If you publish the article on your website, create internal links: In the article itself, place links for all terms that have relevant pages on the website. On other pages, link to the new article where it\u2019s appropriate. If you have a technical possibility, use different keywords for each link you\u2019re placing. Don\u2019t forget that you already have an extensive list of keywords from the first step. Social Channels \nThere are two models when it comes to broadcasting content over social networks. \nSome companies craft a separate piece of content for each network, trying to achieve maximum performance. \nWe practice more cost-effective approach, under which we create multi-channel content right from the start. That helps us align all the efforts across different social channels and avoid repetitive tasks. Leads Covers \nTo save everyone\u2019s time, the first photo chosen by the expert at the outlining stage should be suitable as a cover image for your social posts. That also prevents the common issue when an SMM staff selects a beautiful (to his or her taste) but absolutely irrelevant picture for a post. \nThe same goes for the first few sentences of an article. Ideally, you should be able to use them as a post teaser without any modification. With a bit of work to instruct copywriters, it\u2019s perfectly doable. OpenGraph \nDepending on your acquisition model, you either drive customers to the full content published on your website and try to convert them there, or you make your social posts actionable by themselves. \nIn the first case, check that your web pages have proper OpenGraph meta tags. These provide attractive and thumbnails when you link your article on third-party sites. Boosting Content with the Help of Employees \nRemember the first part , where we were trying hard to get an experts\u2019 buy-in? Now it\u2019s time to reap the benefits. \nAs our experts have participated actively in the content creation, they will be more than eager to help promote it on social networks. The only thing you might want to ensure first is a couple of ground rules to follow the brand identify and exclude inappropriate language. Email \nEmail marketing is praised by many professionals as one of the most effective channels, especially in B2B. \nBut if you don\u2019t have a dedicated person to manage the mailing list, the main problem you would run into is who is going to create adapted content. Like with the social channels, we work around this issue by using the first image and a teaser of the article in emails. It goes without saying that it requires copywriters to give particular attention to this part of the content, making it attractive and engaging. Making Readers Convert \nEvery piece of content you create should be crafted with the target action in mind. To ensure that customers perform the desired action \u2013 subscription, add to cart, inquiry \u2013 place several call-to-action (CTA) blocks throughout the article. \nWe prefer to situate a non-intrusive block after each section of the article. The benefit of this approach is that you can craft your message to be relevant to a section, boosting the conversion rate and growing your number of potential prospects. \nFor example, if you have an article about planning a vacation in Mexico, and you have different sections on best luxury, cheap, and family hotels. It stands to reason you should make three different call-to-action blocks with specific links and value propositions. \nAs with any other sources, track conversions from your content. \nBe careful, though, with placing UTM marks in your CTAs. Unfortunately, Google Analytics splits a visit when a visitor clicks the UTM-marked internal link. Instead, you might want to set up JavaScript-based goals. Conclusion \nAfter reading this three-part series you now know what it takes to create a scalable expert content strategy that involves you subject matter experts. So base your efforts on demand, engage experts in creating content, and ensure multi-channel fit. \nMore Content Marketing Resources Here:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google analytics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:45.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5807b971fb64918ff61ad3dd9768b9dd05c4ab10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQROs4wD8hBgat4fZiMFDxqahT7vDxcJ14jDXZHsW4BtHL6oU9G92.k", "site_full": "forums.developer.apple.com", "site": "apple.com", "site_section": "https://forums.developer.apple.com/community/safari-and-web/safari-extensions", "site_categories": ["mac_support", "tech"], "section_title": "Space: Safari Extensions | Apple Developer Forums", "title": "app extension not detected in showPrefer...", "title_full": "Safari app extension not detected in showPrefer... | Apple Developer Forums", "published": "2017-11-23T13:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 49, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd518bf7aff435fe749f1597dfe35f2f60adf083", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQROs4wD8hBgat4fZiMFDxqahT7vDxcJ14jDXZHsW4BtNluAR3C8dsyNAeAhGzS.f8Z9tmKjmAmamUKWi5452b_", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "bweinstein", "published": "2017-11-29T20:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The error you are seeing appears to be SFErrorNoExtensionFound - which means that on the machines running 10.12.6, they are unable to find your extension.\nA few questions:\n1) Is the app you are trying to distribute signed using a Mac App Store or Devloper ID certificate?\n2) If the users who are failing to use the API opens Safari's preferences, do they see your extension in there?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:45.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9decd5a247320939283ebabda5230e5c3a99118f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pS6UTRlu.pf.fWsFvYyGhi7jbHVQoMyHy", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/tv/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/tv/ - Television &amp; Film - 4chan", "title": "versus thread?", "title_full": "/tv/ - versus thread? - Television & Film - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T09:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.02, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "634e532974aaeb1074ff1018c048f39b84a5bdcb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pS6UTRlu.pf.fWsFvYyGhi_fNwXYz6H.3c4sRBrk9gYI-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T09:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>91194665\nTIB8BIT obviously.

In a notoriously opaque and confusing industry that\u2019s prone to frequent changes, we see immense benefit in helping all of you stay on top of the game. To that end, every couple of years we ask for a report card of sorts, hoping not only to get a sense for how your jobs have changed, but also to get a sense for how we can improve. \nAbout a month ago, we asked you all to take a reader survey, and nearly 600 of you generously gave your time. The results, summarized in this post, were immensely helpful, and were a reminder of how lucky we are to have such a thoughtful community of readers. style=\"display:inline-block;width:336px;height:280px\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6195106720243437\" data-ad-slot=\"9231209008\"> \nI\u2019ve offered as much data as I can, and when possible, I\u2019ve also trended responses against the same questions from our 2015 and 2013 surveys, so you can get a sense for how things have changed. There\u2019s a lot here, so buckle up. =) Who our readers are \nTo put all of this great feedback into context, it helps to know a bit about who the people in our audience actually are. Sure, we can glean a bit of information from our site analytics, and can make some educated guesses, but neither of those can answer the questions we\u2019re most curious about. What\u2019s your day-to-day work like, and how much SEO does it really involve? Would you consider yourself more of an SEO beginner, or more of an SEO wizard? And, most importantly, what challenges are you facing in your work these days? The answers give us a fuller understanding of where the rest of your feedback comes from. What is your job title? \nReaders of the Moz Blog have a multitude of backgrounds, from CEOs of agencies to in-the-weeds SEOs of all skill levels. One of the most common themes we see, though, is a skew toward the more general marketing industry. I know that word clouds have their faults, but it\u2019s still a relatively interesting way to gauge how often things appear in a list like this, so here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got this year: \nOf note, similar to our results in 2015, the word \u201cmarketing\u201d is the most common result, followed by the word \u201cSEO\u201d and the word \u201cmanager.\u201d \nHere\u2019s a look at the top 20 terms used in this year\u2019s results, along with the percentage of responses containing each term. You\u2019ll also see those same percentages from the 2015 and 2013 surveys to give you an idea of what\u2019s changed \u2014 the darker the bar, the more recent the survey: \nThe thing that surprises me the most about this list is how little it\u2019s changed in the four-plus years since we first asked the question (a theme you\u2019ll see recur in the rest of these results). In fact, the top 20 terms this year are nearly identical to the top 20 terms four years ago, with only a few things sliding up or down a few spots. What percentage of your day-to-day work involves SEO? \nWe hear a lot about people wearing multiple hats for their companies. One person who took this survey noted that even at a 9,000-person company, they were the only one who worked on SEO, and it was only about 80% of their job. That idea is backed up by this data, which shows an incredibly broad range of responses. More than 10% of respondents barely touch SEO, and not even 14% say they\u2019re full-time: \nOne interesting thing to note is the sharp decline in the number of people who say that SEO isn\u2019t a part of their day-to-day at all. That shift is likely a result of our shift back toward SEO, away from related areas like social media and content marketing. I think we had attracted a significant number of community managers and content specialists who didn\u2019t work in SEO, and we\u2019re now seeing the pendulum swing the other direction. On a scale of 1-5, how advanced would you say your SEO knowledge is? \nThe similarity between this year\u2019s graph for this question and those from 2015 and 2013 is simply astonishing: \nThere\u2019s been a slight drop in folks who say they\u2019re at an expert level, and a slight increase in folks who have some background, but are relative beginners. But only slight. The interesting thing is, our blog traffic has increased significantly over these four years, so the newer members of our audience bear a striking resemblance to those of you who\u2019ve been around for quite some time. In a sense, that\u2019s reassuring \u2014 it paints a clear picture for us as we continue refining our content. Do you work in-house, or at an agency/consultancy? \nHere\u2019s another window into just how little our audience has changed in the last couple of years: \nA slight majority of our readers still work in-house for their own companies, and about a third still work on SEO for their company\u2019s clients. \nInterestingly, though, respondents who work for clients deal with many of the same issues as those who work in-house \u2014 especially in trying to convey the value of their work in SEO. They\u2019re just trying to send that message to external clients instead of internal stakeholders. More details on that come from our next question: What are some of the biggest challenges you face in your work today? \nI\u2019m consistently amazed by the time and thought that so many of you put into answering this question, and rest assured, your feedback will be presented to several teams around Moz, both on the marketing and the product sides. For this question, I organized each and every response into recurring themes, tallying each time those themes were mentioned. Here are all the themes that were mentioned 10 or more times: \nMore than anything else, it\u2019s patently obvious that one of the greatest difficulties faced by any SEO is explaining it to other people in a way that demonstrates its value while setting appropriate expectations for results. Whether it\u2019s your clients, your boss, or your peers that you\u2019re trying to convince, it isn\u2019t an easy case to make, especially when it\u2019s so difficult to show what kind of return a company can see from an investment in SEO. \nWe also saw tons of frustrated responses about how the industry is constantly changing, and it takes too much of your already-constrained time just to stay on top of those changes. \nIn terms of tactics, link building easily tops the list of challenges. That makes sense, as it\u2019s the piece of SEO that relies most heavily on the cooperation of other human beings (and humans are often tricky beings to figure out). =) \nContent marketing \u2014 both the creation/copywriting side as well as the strategy side \u2014 is still a challenge for many folks in the industry, though fewer people mentioned it this year as mentioned it in 2015, so I think we\u2019re all starting to get used to how those skills overlap with the more traditional aspects of SEO. How our readers read \nWith all that context in mind, we started to dig into your preferences in terms of formats, frequency, and subject matter on the blog. How often do you read posts on the Moz Blog? \nThis is the one set of responses that caused a bit of concern. We\u2019ve seen a steady decrease in the number of people who say they read every day, a slight decrease in the number of people who say they read multiple times each week, and a dramatic increase in the number of people who say they read once a week. \nThe 2015 decrease came after an expansion in the scope of subjects we covered on the blog \u2014 as we branched away from just SEO, we published more posts about social media, email, and other aspects of digital marketing. We knew that not all of those subjects were relevant for everyone, so we expected a dip in frequency of readership. \nThis year, though, we\u2019ve attempted to refocus on SEO, and might have expected a bit of a rebound. That didn\u2019t happen: \nThere are two other factors at play, here. For one thing, we no longer publish a post every single weekday. After our publishing volume experiment in 2015, we realized it was safe (even beneficial) to emphasize quality over quantity, so if we don\u2019t feel like a post turned out the way we hoped, we don\u2019t publish it until we\u2019ve had a chance to improve it. That means we\u2019re down to about four posts per week. We\u2019ve also made a concerted effort to publish more posts about local SEO, as that\u2019s relevant to our software and an increasingly important part of the work of folks in our industry. \nIt could also be a question of time \u2014 we\u2019ve already covered how little time everyone in our industry has, and with that problem continuing, there may just be less time to read blog posts. \nIf anyone has any additional insight into why they read less often than they once did, please let us know in the comments below! On which types of devices do you prefer to read blog posts? \nWe were surprised by the responses to this answer in 2013, and they\u2019ve only gotten more extreme: \nNearly everyone prefers to read blog posts on a full computer. Only about 15% of folks add their phones into the equation, and the number of people in all the other buckets is extremely small. In 2013, our blog didn\u2019t have a responsive design, and was quite difficult to read on mobile devices. We thought that might have had something to do with people\u2019s responses \u2014 maybe they were just used to reading our blog on larger screens. The trend in 2015 and this year, though, proves that\u2019s not the case. People just prefer reading posts on their computers, plain and simple. Which other site(s), if any, do you regularly visit for information or education on SEO? \nThis was a new question for this year. We have our own favorite sites, of course, but we had no idea how the majority of folks would respond to this question. As it turns out, there was quite a broad range of responses listing sites that take very different approaches: \nI suppose it\u2019s no surprise that the most prolific sites sit at the top. They\u2019ve always got something new, even if the stories don\u2019t often go into much depth. We\u2019ve tended to steer our own posts toward longer-form, in-depth pieces, and I think it\u2019s safe to say (based on these responses and some to questions below) that it\u2019d be beneficial for us to include some shorter stories, too. In other words, depth shouldn\u2019t necessarily be a requisite for a post to be published on the Moz Blog. We may start experimenting with a more \u201cshort and sweet\u201d approach to some posts. What our readers think of the blog \nHere\u2019s where we get into more specific feedback about the Moz Blog, including whether it\u2019s relevant, how easy it is for you to consume, and more. What percentage of the posts on the Moz Blog would you say are relevant to you and your work? \nOverall, I\u2019m pretty happy with the results here, as SEO is a broad enough industry (and we\u2019ve got a broad enough audience) that there\u2019s simply no way we\u2019re going to hit the sweet spot for everyone with every post. But those numbers toward the bottom of the chart are low enough that I feel confident we\u2019re doing pretty well in terms of topic relevance. Do you feel the Moz Blog posts are generally too basic, too advanced, or about right? \nResponses to this question have made me smile every time I see them. This is clearly one thing we\u2019re getting about as right as we could expect to. We\u2019re even seeing a slight balancing of the \u201ctoo basic\u201d and \u201ctoo advanced\u201d columns over time, which is great: \nWe also asked the people who told us that posts were \u201ctoo basic\u201d or \u201ctoo advanced\u201d to what extent they felt that way, using a scale from 1-5 (1 being \u201cjust a little bit too basic/advanced\u201d and 5 being \u201cway too basic/advanced.\u201d The responses tell us that the people who feel posts are too advanced feel more strongly about that opinion than the people who feel posts are too basic: \nThis makes some sense, I think. If you\u2019re just starting out in SEO, which many of our readers are, some of the posts on this blog are likely to go straight over your head. That could be frustrating. If you\u2019re an SEO expert, though, you probably aren\u2019t frustrated by posts you see as too basic for you \u2014 you just skip past them and move on with your day. \nThis does make me think, though, that we might benefit from offering a dedicated section of the site for folks who are just starting out \u2014 more than just the Beginner\u2019s Guide. That\u2019s actually something that was specifically requested by one respondent this year. In general, what do you think about the length of Moz Blog posts? \nWhile it definitely seems like we\u2019re doing pretty well in this regard, I\u2019d also say we\u2019ve got some room to tighten things up a bit, especially in light of the lack of time so many of you mentioned: \nThere were quite a few comments specifically asking for \u201cshort and sweet\u201d posts from time to time \u2014 offering up useful tips or news in a format that didn\u2019t expound on details because it didn\u2019t have to. I think sprinkling some of those types of posts in with the longer-form posts we have so often would be beneficial. Do you ever comment on Moz Blog posts? \nThis was another new question this year. Despite so many sites are removing comment sections from their blogs, we\u2019ve always believed in their value. Sometimes the discussions we see in comments end up being the most helpful part of the posts, and we value our community too much to keep that from happening. So, we were happy to see a full quarter of respondents have participated in comments: \nWe also asked for a bit of info about why you either do or don\u2019t comment on posts. The top reasons why you do were pretty predictable \u2014 to ask a clarifying question related to the post, or to offer up your own perspective on the topic at hand. The #3 reason was interesting \u2014 18 people mentioned that they like to comment in order to thank the author for their hard work. This is a great sentiment, and as someone who\u2019s published several posts on this blog, I can say for a fact that it does feel pretty great. At the same time, those comments are really only written for one person \u2014 the author \u2014 and are a bit problematic from our perspective, because they add noise around the more substantial conversations, which are what we like to see most. \nI think the solution is going to lie in a new UI element that allows readers to note their appreciation to the authors without leaving one of the oft-maligned \u201cGreat post!\u201d comments. There\u2019s got to be a happy medium there, and I think it\u2019s worth our finding it. \nThe reasons people gave for not commenting were even more interesting. A bunch of people mentioned the need to log in (sorry, folks \u2014 if we didn\u2019t require that, we\u2019d spend half our day removing spam!). The most common response, though, involved a lack of confidence. Whether it was worded along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m an introvert\u201d or along the lines of \u201cI just don\u2019t have a lot of expertise,\u201d there were quite a few people who worried about how their comments would be received. \nI want to take this chance to encourage those of you who feel that way to take the step, and ask questions about points you find confusing. At the very least, I can guarantee you aren\u2019t the only ones, and others like you will appreciate your initiative. One of the best ways to develop your expertise is to get comfortable asking questions. We all work in a really confusing industry, and the Moz Blog is all about providing a place to help each other out. What, if anything, would you like to see different about the Moz Blog? \nAs usual, the responses to this question were chock full of great suggestions, and again, we so appreciate the amount of time you all spent providing really thoughtful feedback. \nOne pattern I saw was requests for more empirical data \u2014 hard evidence that things should be done a certain way, whether through case studies or other formats. Another pattern was requests for step-by-step walkthroughs. That makes a lot of sense for an industry of folks who are strapped for time: Make things as clear-cut as possible, and where we can, offer a linear path you can walk down instead of asking you to holistically understand the subject matter, then figure that out on your own. (That\u2019s actually something we\u2019re hoping to do with our entire Learning Center: Make it easier to figure out where to start, and where to continue after that, instead of putting everything into buckets and asking you all to figure it out.) \nWhiteboard Friday remains a perennial favorite, and we were surprised to see more requests for more posts about our own tools than we had requests for fewer posts about our own tools. (We\u2019ve been wary of that in the past, as we wanted to make sure we never crossed from \u201chelpful\u201d into \u201csalesy,\u201d something we\u2019ll still focus on even if we do add another tool-based post here and there.) \nWe expected a bit of feedback about the format of the emails \u2014 we\u2019re absolutely working on that! \u2014 but didn\u2019t expect to see so many folks requesting that we bring back YouMoz. That\u2019s something that\u2019s been on the backs of our minds, and while it may not take the same form it did before, we do plan on finding new ways to encourage the community to contribute content, and hope to have something up and running early in 2018. What our readers want to see \nThis section is a bit more future-facing, where some of what we asked before had to do with how things have been in the past. Which of the following topics would you like to learn more about? \nThere were very, very few surprises in this list. Lots of interest in on-page SEO and link building, as well as other core tactical areas of SEO. Content, branding, and social media all took dips \u2014 that makes sense, given the fact that we don\u2019t usually post about those things anymore, and we\u2019ve no doubt lost some audience members who were more interested in them as a result. Interestingly, mobile took a sizable dip, too. I\u2019d be really curious to know what people think about why that is. My best guess is that with the mobile-first indexing from Google and with responsive designs having become so commonplace, there isn\u2019t as much of a need as there once was to think of mobile much differently than there was a couple of years ago. Also of note: When we did this survey in 2015, Google had recently rolled out its \u201c Mobile-Friendly Update ,\u201d not-so-affectionately referred to by many in the industry as Mobilegeddon. So\u2026 it was on our minds. =) Which of the following types of posts would you most like to see on the Moz Blog? \nThis is a great echo and validation of what we took away from the more general question about what you\u2019d like to see different about the Blog: More tactical posts and step-by-step walkthroughs. Posts that cut to the chase and offer a clear direction forward, as opposed to some of the types at the bottom of this list, which offer more opinions and cerebral explorations: What happens next? \nNow we go to work. =) \nWe\u2019ll spend some time fully digesting this info, and coming up with new goals for 2018 aimed at making improvements inspired by your feedback. We\u2019ll keep you all apprised as we start moving forward. \nIf you have any additional insight that strikes you in taking a look at these results, please do share it in the comments below \u2014 we\u2019d love to have those discussions. \nFor now, we\u2019ve got some initial takeaways that we\u2019re already planning to take action on. Primary takeaways \nThere are some relatively obvious things we can take away from these results that we\u2019re already working on: People in all businesses are finding it quite difficult to communicate the value of SEO to their clients, bosses, and colleagues. That\u2019s something we can help with, and we\u2019ll be developing materials in the near future to try and alleviate some of that particular frustration. There\u2019s a real desire for more succinct, actionable, step-by-step walkthroughs on the Blog. We can pretty easily explore formats for posts that are off our \u201cbeaten path,\u201d and will attempt to make things easier to consume through improvements to both the content itself and its delivery. I think there\u2019s some room for more \u201cshort and sweet\u201d mixed in with our longer norm. The bulk of our audience does more than just SEO, despite a full 25% of them having it in their job titles, and the challenges you mentioned include a bunch of areas that are related to , but outside the traditional world of SEO. Since you all are clearly working on those sorts of things, we should work to highlight and facilitate the relationship between the SEO work and the non-SEO marketing work you do. In looking through some of the other sites you all visit for information on SEO, and knowing the kinds of posts they typically publish, it\u2019s clear we\u2019ve got an opportunity to publish more news. We\u2019ve always dreamed of being more of a one-stop shop for SEO content, and that\u2019s good validation that we may want to head down that path. \nAgain, thank you all so much for the time and effort you spent filling out this survey. Hopefully you\u2019ll notice some changes in the near (and not-so-near) future that make it clear we\u2019re really listening. \nIf you\u2019ve got anything to add to these results \u2014 insights, further explanations, questions for clarification, rebuttals of points, etc. \u2014 please leave them in the comments below. We\u2019re looking forward to continuing the conversation. =) Related Posts:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:21:45.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d7488a90c8591e4ef68aa1625ea4dbbd2ed2c72c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS4mlWRaQOV30AHBjwgH78HaLneCKktrsX1vbqcYopGaiVqIS59vW6TMiCcFLvkyaiqehlQhtiaFz46a1J.I88HxHbD4MeJJQypFAEyUcmmPvDGnYaSs.Pyv7L0BGCmWf0", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Personal Finance", "title": "I am 21, completely dependent on parents, and have 0 credit.

Over the past couple of weeks, I\u2019ve been using it extensively and have had mostly positive results \u2014 though not always. \nCurrently, Lens can read text (e.g., business cards), identify buildings and landmarks (sometimes), provide information on artwork, books and movies (from a poster) and scan barcodes. It can also identify products (much of the time) and capture and keep (in Google Keep) handwritten notes, though it doesn\u2019t turn them into text. style=\"display:inline-block;width:336px;height:280px\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6195106720243437\" data-ad-slot=\"9231209008\"> \nTo use Lens, you tap the icon in the lower right of the screen when Google Assistant is invoked. Then you tap the image or object or part of an object you want to scan. \nAs a barcode scanner, it works nearly every time. In that regard, it\u2019s worthy and a more versatile substitute for Amazon\u2019s app and just as fast or faster in many cases. If there\u2019s no available barcode, it can often correctly identify products from their packaging or labels. It also does very well identifying famous works of art and books. \nGoogle Lens struggled most with buildings and with products that didn\u2019t have any labeling on them. For example (below), it was rather embarrassingly unable to identify an Apple laptop as a computer, and it misidentified Google Home as \u201caluminum foil.\u201d \nWhen Lens gets it wrong it asks you to let it know. And when it\u2019s uncertain but you affirm its guess, you can get good information. \nI tried Lens on numerous well-known buildings in New York, and it was rarely able to identify them. For example, the three buildings below (left to right) are New York City Hall, the World Trade Center and part of the 9/11 memorial. (In the first case, if you\u2019re thinking, he tapped the tree and not the building, I took multiple pictures from different angles, and it didn\u2019t get one right.) \nI also took lots of pictures of random objects (articles of clothing, shoes, money) and those searches were a bit hit-and-miss, though often, when it missed it was a near-miss. \nAs these results indicate, Google Lens is far from perfect. But it\u2019s much much better than Google Goggles ever was, and it will improve over time. Google will also add capabilities that expand use cases. \nIt\u2019s best right now for very specific uses, which Google tries to point out in its blog post . One of the absolute best uses is capturing business cards and turning them into contacts on your phone. \nAssuming that Google is committed to Lens and continues investing in it, over time it could become a widely adopted alternative to traditional mobile and voice search. It might eventually also drive considerable mobile commerce.

Her detailed descriptions can make a beautiful near mint vintage dress sound like a rag one step away from the garbage.\nSince you are selling used items, the fact that they are used should imply that they are not perfect and should have problems.

Washing usually removes it, but most estate sales do a quick wash and rarely gets the worst of it out of corners and details, so look carefully.\nAnd I recently learned this and feel the need to pass it along.

The new bike sounds very good. Looking at the picture, I just don't know where anyone could mount \"forward\" footpegs, without drilling holes. Hope they come up with something, as most riders like to move around on long trips. It looks as tho cornering clearance would be lessened, if they were mounted on the small protruding engine guard. Maybe the new \"cockpit\" will be so comfortable, riders won't want to stretch out their legs. Not sure that will work for the \"tall\" riders. Just have to wait and see.\nThe \"tip over protectors\" below the Heads are just plastic covers that pop right off to gain access to the Bar for mounting Pegs. BUT... the bars do not have a lot of room behind them. At the show the after market guys said they are already working on it!!!

Three days later, she popped out of the medium. \nA day after that, she has put on some height. \nHowever, she looks a little stretchy so the CFL was removed and replaced with the 400W metal halide positioned 34 inches above the seedling. March 19 th \nJust a quick update. \nThe MH light is 28 inches away from the top of the seedling. The growth rate seems to be on par with previous seedlings. \nInside the cabinet, the temperature is, on average, 73 degrees F and average humidity is 43%. These figures are average because every time the inline fan kicks in to control high temperature, all the humid air created by the humidifier gets sucked right out. \nEven a week after popping from the soil, the little girl has yet to receive any nutes. The plan is to start with 250PPM in a couple of days. \nIf you have any questions about the setup, keep in mind it\u2019s based on a water farm. It consists of a top, 5 gallon bucket with a 9-inch net put filled with hydroton and a bottom tote holding 4 gallons of solution. The solution is pumped up to the drip ring by a 160 GPH pump. The solution drains out the bottom of the upper bucket into the reservoir and recirculates. The pump runs 24/7. \nThe temperature controller energizes an electrical receptacle. One plug is for cooling, the other is for heating. When the temperature inside the cabinet is raised to a pre-determined level, the inline fan kicks in and the temperature is drawn back down and shuts off at the set temperature. \nWhen the light goes off after 18 hours, it starts to get too cold in the cab. When the temperature drops to a certain level, the personal space heater kicks on and brings the temperature back up. \nThe humidity controller does a similar job. When the room humidity of the air inside the cabinet drops below a certain level, a humidifier inside kicks in. Then it shuts off after the room humidity of the air reaches the set level. The humidifier is absolutely necessary because the basement is so dry these days. March 26 th \nHere\u2019s an updated photo 15 days after sprout! \nNutes were added on Day 11. She received 290 PPM of Flora Nova and adjusted the pH to 5.7. Two weeks in and the plant seems to be growing as it should. Things should get greener in a week or so. April 4 th \nGood growth this week! PPM is at 410, kept pH at 5.8 until 3 days ago when whitish markings appeared on some leaves. Then the pH was left along to slowly rise to 6.3. April 9 th \nIt\u2019s Day 29 and some whitish markings continue to show. Thought it was light burn so tried raising the light but to no effect. She\u2019s still growing well but at this point, it\u2019s best to keep an eye out for any abnormalities. \nFor now, decided to keep the pH in the lower levels to better absorb calcium and magnesium in case deficiencies are the cause of the white spots. \nChanged the reservoir too. Nutrients (Flora Nova Bloom) are at 850 PPM and pH 5.1 this morning. LST was started today to get her ready for SCROG. \nShe showed good growth this week. The plant is 4.5 inches tall with 7 internodes. April 16 th \nLST can\u2019t get enough light to the lower nodes so she underwent some serious defoliation. This young lady is still short and have a good bit of height. Check out some before and after photos! \nOvernight, she recovered and looked robust again. So she underwent even more defoliation! The main stem split but the foliage above the split is still healthy and green. Onward and upward! April 23 rd \nShe has even more excellent growth this week! \nEven better news: the whitish spots and streaks on some of the leaves have disappeared. At this point, evidence points to them having been caused by light burn \u2013 not from heat, but from intensity. The brand new 400MH is now 34 inches above the canopy. \nDecided to let her veg another week. The defoliation last week is responsible for some robust branching. She was defoliated again. Here are a couple of before and after shots. April 30 th \nIt didn\u2019t seem possible but she got even bushier since last week\u2019s defoliation. There are a lot of branches to manage and it\u2019s difficult to consistently tie them down because of the decreasing number of anchor points. \nAs promised, the lights were flipped to the 12/12 schedule and put in the SCROG which should help manage the branches and the lighting resources. \nAs it warms up with springtime, the basement\u2019s humidity and temperatures have changed. Had to make some changes to the ventilation, humidifying, and temperature inside the closet. \nHumidifier has been turned off but the closet is around 65% because of the leaf transpiration. The basement outside the closet is in the mid-50s. May 10 th \nNot much to see here other than a couple of photos to show her progress on the 9 th day of flower. May 14 th \nThe bush is filling in the SCROG. Hopefully, the SCROG won\u2019t be overwhelmed. \nThe 400W HPS is running much cooler than the MH so don\u2019t need the exhaust fan controlled by the temperature switch anymore. The exhaust fan is controlled with the humidistat and comes on for about 30 seconds every 10 to 15 minutes. The resulting humidity is around 45% and the temperature is consistently at 73 degrees. \nYou may see the beginning of flowers in this picture. May 23 rd \nDid a major defoliation on Day 21 of flower. It\u2019s amazing how much light is now getting to all the bud sites! The third photo on the left showed how the plant recovered two days after the extensive defoliation. May 29 th \nThe flowers are coming along. The defoliation has brought good light to all colas. \nYou can\u2019t see it in the photos but the canopy is not very even. There\u2019s not much that can be done about it other than re-designing the setup to a certain extent. June 4 th \nThe photos show there\u2019s been good flower growth over the last week. \nThe canopy is still rather uneven since there\u2019s no more room to spread the plant out. There are colas under colas. She has turned stickier over the past week. \nOn a side note, took clones at Day 21 of flower. All three were planted in Rapid Rooters and already have roots coming out the sides. June 11 th \nDid the final defoliation today. It\u2019s surprising to see how much vegetation have been removed and the plant is still very leafy. Here are some \u201cbefore\u201d photos: \nAnd this is how she looks like after the defol. June 24 th \nBeen two weeks since the last update. Today is Day 55 in flower. Most Pineapple Express growers need at least 65 days. \nNot seeing many darkening pistils. So far, she\u2019s been showing modest growth. The roots look great \u2013 nice, white, and smelling delicious. July 10 th \nHaven\u2019t had the chance to update in two weeks. Here\u2019s how the plant looked like a few days before harvest: \nHarvest was done on July 4 th . \nAs you can see, she\u2019s a bit on the paltry side. July 12 th \nCut up the dried material and put it in mason jars for curing.
