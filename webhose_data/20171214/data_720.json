Annuity sales stood at 7 billion pounds in 2016, they noted, reiterating their \u201cunderperform\u201d rating on the stock.\nAt 0910 GMT, shares in L&G were up 0.53 percent at 263.1 pence, compared with a 0.23 percent rise in the FTSE 100 index.\n$1 = 0.7479 pounds Reporting by Clara Denina; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clara denina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason neely", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigel wilson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kbw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters staff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l&g", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:50.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f1827aeb406494f0aa26e607d2249954eb8501e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFe8IiWXRDQ3xSne3LJMbRF76meeKmWn1DZSmZplqc_kKDHXpPdFZuipjhbfieM1YXVBeau7gGb3MEutJBwnbn9jHIp_btrnvbttA_FrPlqfsvfoGRzfW2IYeeqXHV8y6rcx4zfeuXsq.uaLaCzsYnZkkPki3El8f3XMq9o5HxYj8ILTxDYyrE_K_5P5D2Gp_4n_7LEk37UhBe46T4R01FgxukQ10jafZXB", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/discovertech/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Discover Tech - Buy Discover Tech at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "niceEshop Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headphone Foldable EDR Earphone Mic MP3 FM Headset For Smart Phones Tablet(Gold+Black)", "title_full": "niceEshop Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headphone Foldable EDR Earphone Mic MP3 FM Headset For Smart Phones Tablet(Gold+Black) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2016-08-23T15:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 270, "participants_count": 228, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c3b95de37e20235068a06bdc8248077ea4abef8e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFe8IiWXRDQ3xSne3LJMbRF76meeKmWn1DZSmZplqc_kKDHXpPdFZuipjhbfieM1YXVBeau7gGb3MEutJBwnbn9jHIp_btrnvbttA_FrPlqfsvfoGRzfW2IYeeqXHV8y6rcx4zfeuXsq.uaLaCzsYnZkkPki3El8f3XMq9o5HxYj8ILTxDYyrE_K_5P5D2Gp_4n_7LEk37UhBe46T4R01Fgxv.pATFIXEt2bj3rp7WFQcU-", "ord_in_thread": 260, "author": "Noredzuan", "published": "2017-11-30T09:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "Kualiti Baik", "text": "Kualiti material dan fungsi baik pada harga yang rendah.

Switching to a new OC and offense, it just took longer to fully employ than expected. We are still not as far along as I would have liked, but with the injuries and juggling of the OL, QB arm strength and a few other deficiencies, it still is explosive.\nI bet if you ask either fan base who has the better coaching staff, the other team's coaches will be the answer.

Thoughts of her dear friend and Calvin\u2019s first wife brought an array of emotions. What would Eliza think of Hattie carrying Calvin\u2019s child? A child Eliza had wanted so much and never had. Hattie usually told herself Eliza would be happy that she and Calvin found comfort together, but there were days when Hattie\u2019s awareness that Calvin still held affection for Eliza rose like a specter. Prayer, studying the Bible, and remembering the assurance she\u2019d felt of God\u2019s approval would usually silence her guilt, but today the fears roiled inside her like the churning wheels of an undertaker\u2019s carriage. \nHad Eliza lived, Hattie would be teaching, writing\u2014unmarried and unpregnant. Had Eliza lived, Calvin would only be the husband of Hattie\u2019s friend, and he would enjoy dinner on the table every night, and pressed pants and clean shirts in the closet every morning. Perhaps Eliza would have given him a child by now. When headaches laid him low, Eliza would tend to him without a thought for herself. \nWould Calvin be happier if Eliza had been the only Mrs. Calvin Stowe? Would Hattie? Was Catharine right? Had Hattie entered a phase that would lead to the demise of being her own person? Anxiety wrapped around her until she found herself sobbing at the splintery kitchen table. \nEliza. Eliza. Eliza. \nWas she living the wrong woman\u2019s life? \n\nAbout the Author \nJosi S. Kilpack hated to read until her mother handed her a copy of The Witch of Blackbird Pond when she was 13. From that day forward, she read everything she could get her hands on and credits her writing \u201ceducation\u201d to the many novels she has \u201cstudied\u201d since then. She began writing her first novel in 1998 and has written twenty-five novels, one cookbook, and been part of multiple collaborations since then. She is a four-time Whitney Award winner and Best of State winner in Fiction. Josi currently lives in Willard, Utah, with her husband and children. \nWhen Kensington Press picked up her first national women\u2019s fiction novel, As Wide as the Sky, Josi was in need of a pen name to differentiate between her other genres. For years, Josi has been called Jessica Pack by people who hear her name but don\u2019t know her, it made her new pen name easy to choose.

Two words - jet sweeps. The jet sweeps basically helped us to beat UF and Auburn. The jet sweeps even opened some things up for LSU against Bama (See D. Williams' long run which was a fake jet sweep). We had 6 first downs, 125 yards and 0 points against them last year.

REUTERS/Kenny Katombe/File Photo \nKINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo, December 6, 2017-An acute hunger emergency in conflict-ravaged Greater Kasai could turn into a long-term disaster, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) warned today. While the agency has been working against the clock to help ever more people, the cash is quickly running out. \u201cWe\u2019re letting down those who need us most,\u201d said Claude Jibidar, WFP\u2019s Representative in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A tightly planned surge had made a big difference, Jibidar explained, but WFP had largely funded this from its own meagre resources. \u201cWithout immediate donor support, many \u2013 particularly women and children \u2013 will die.\u201d The eruption of violence in what used to be a poor but peaceful region has claimed countless lives. Some 1.4 million people have been forced from their homes. Traditionally high malnutrition rates have sky-rocketed. With 3.2 million people desperately short of food, WFP has stepped in with emergency assistance. A lull in fighting has allowed more staff to be deployed. Aid workers have fanned out into the Kasai countryside. WFP has co-ordinated multi-agency logistics and humanitarian flights. As a result, the number of people assisted has grown rapidly \u2013 from 42,000 in September to 115,000 in October and 225,000 in November. Last month, 13,500 children were given special fortified foods. But donors\u2019 reluctance to commit to Kasai is jeopardizing this effort. While WFP plans to feed almost half a million people in December, so depleted are the agency\u2019s coffers that only half-rations can be distributed. Hunger not only puts lives at risk: it forces people into prostitution and increases the risk of sexual violence, Jibidar stressed. \u201cGovernment partners must do all in their power to spare Kasai from the kind of decades-long humanitarian catastrophe that has plagued other DRC regions.\u201d Sharing is caring!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "claude jibidar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jibidar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wfp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations world food programme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations organization stabilization mission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "democratic republic of congo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kasai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emocratic republic of congo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greater kasai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kinshasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic republic of the congo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north kivu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:52.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d6cffa2084f2847b767f104b963e63d2315d3a91", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAput6RsM1mAHJ32EMR6iHLMNKMq.JDR__kHfU1fnmslyo6fkQbA.ULGPnKBjP9Q3dpwBUWohAPtH3Q--", "site_full": "midmarsh.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://midmarsh.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "MIDMARSH JOTTINGS", "title": "Dazzling Penny", "title_full": "Dazzling Penny", "published": "2017-11-29T09:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a999e3181401895d83879518c604254e4f4037a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAput6RsM1mAHJ32EMR6iHLMNKMq.JDR__kHfU1fnmslyo6fkQbA.ULGPnKBjP9Q3dpzO06QU0zBz5Q--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Midmarsh John", "published": "2017-12-07T10:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Adrian: Had to look up Harris Effect.

(AP) - Desean Murray scored a season-high 20 points and Anfernee McLemore finished with 17 to lead Auburn to an 80-55 victory over Gardner-Webb Wednesday night. \nMcLemore also had 11 rebounds and six blocked shots for the Tigers (7-1), who have won five consecutive games for just the second time under coach Bruce Pearl. McLemore made all four of his 3-point attempts and punctuated the performance with an alley oop from Jared Harper. \nMurray was 8-of-12 shooting and had seven rebounds. McLemore had eight points in the first five minutes, including back-to-back 3-pointers. \nDavid Efianayi led Gardner-Webb (3-7) with 16 points on 5-of-14 shooting. Jaheam Cornwall scored 11. \nAuburn jumped to a big lead early and kept expanding it even when Mustapha Heron left in the first half with a lower back injury. He had five points in nine minutes. \nThe Tigers outrebounded the Runnin' Bulldogs 52-31. \nHarper had 10 of Auburn's 19 assists. \nTHE TAKEAWAY \nGardner-Webb: Couldn't match Auburn's size and athleticism. Made just 20 of 56 shots (35.7 percent). \nAuburn: Have started 7-1 for just the fourth time since 2000 and first since 2011. Built a 17-point lead over the first six minutes, starting 5 of 6 from 3-point range. Led 42-28 at halftime after making 9 of 18 3s. \nCRAFT'S RETURN: Gardner-Webb coach Tim Craft was an assistant coach at Auburn from 2008-10. This was the team's second meeting and first since 2005. \nUP NEXT \nGardner-Webb: Visits another major conference team, Maryland, on Saturday. \nAuburn: Hosts in-state team UAB on Saturday to conclude its season-long three-game home stand..

At more than eight months and counting, it is now New York City\u2019s longest strike in three decades.\nYet the promised \u201cconsequences\u201d for Charter have not been forthcoming from City Hall.\nWill the newly reelected mayor ever follow through on his promise to support Local 3 and protect New York\u2019s \u201cunion town\u201d reputation? For that answer, Local 3 members should look to the experience of the unions that know him best: those representing the employees who work for him.\nLocal 3 might be surprised to learn that de Blasio recently offered New York City police officers 31/2 years of absolutely zero raises unless we agree to the same kind of retirement and health care cuts demanded by Charter.\nThey also might be shocked to discover that de Blasio has granted city workers the smallest raises that we have seen in almost 50 years. Even Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg offered a minimum of 13% and 17.15% raises, respectively, for the first seven years of contracts they negotiated. De Blasio only offered a baseline of 10%, which is further diminished by dramatic health care givebacks.\nUnfortunately, Local 3\u2019s situation is a textbook example of the double bind faced by working women and men across the country:\nOn the one side, union members face a well-honed management strategy that asks them to pay for their own raises by sacrificing their retirements, their health care, their time off, and even their work-rule protections. Those who accept this deal are quick to discover that their raises have been eaten up by the rising cost of living, while the rights and benefits they traded away are gone for good.\nThose who resist may seek support from traditional labor allies in government, where they\u2019ll receive plenty of encouraging words but often very little in the way of action.\nMeanwhile, those same pro-labor elected officials are using the anti-worker management game plan against their own employees \u2014 claiming they believe the deck is stacked against working people. Then, they turn around and use that same stacked deck to deal themselves a favorable hand.\nAll of this serves as a clear sign that \u2014 in a \u201cunion town\u201d like New York \u2014 we are not doing enough to hold our elected leaders accountable for their labor records.\nThis year\u2019s mayoral race was Exhibit A. The assumption that labor would remain united behind the mayor, among other factors, kept the most viable challengers on the sidelines. There were decent, honorable candidates who remained in the race, but from the outset they had no clear path to victory.\nMany voters who were dissatisfied with the mayor\u2019s labor policies \u2014 or any of his other policies, for that matter \u2014 saw no point in casting a protest vote and instead stayed home. He continued to portray himself as a friend of labor throughout his campaign, knowing full well that working New Yorkers had little leverage at the ballot box.\nWhile the mayor is no longer stumping for New Yorkers\u2019 votes, his future ambitions surely depend on maintaining his worker-friendly image. He should be forced to earn it.\nThe mayor may claim, with some justification, that there is a limit to the influence he can exert over a private-sector labor dispute. But if he is going to stand up before union members and promise \u201cconsequences\u201d for a callous employer who won\u2019t come to the table, then he needs to deliver them.\nAnd in the one area of labor relations over which he has complete control, he needs to stop behaving like one of the \u201cgreedy corporations\u201d he rails against. Only then can he say that New York is a union town.\nLynch is president of the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association.\nSend a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=On%20union%20power%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20two-faced%20Bill%20de%20Blasio&url=http://nydn.us/2Afz7mS"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill de blasio", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "mayor de blasio", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "lynch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de blasio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rudy giuliani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de blasio", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "spectrum cable", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibew", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benevolent association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charter communications", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city hall", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:53.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9eb3738a4bfa90fdfb1aba575d4abfb3580f547c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5fRQTzTISYn5pQnSs5xexu8CgNrfOvUlimRROqjgAq8RisAuhYoGRAnJaBE9Mf8TqxIAlzdF7sFKbLByw6V_4_", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/lsu-sports/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Tiger Rant - LSU Football - Sports Forum | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Pruitt to be announced as Tennessee HC", "title_full": "Pruitt to be announced as Tennessee HC | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T08:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c378eaa937474e7a4df579d86148ccd33d366de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W5fRQTzTISYn5pQnSs5xexu8CgNrfOvUlimRROqjgAq8RisAuhYoGRAnJaBE9Mf8TqxIAlzdF7sFI5zEF1lU2jslysFrlaUs2w-", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "Malaysian Tiger", "published": "2017-12-07T11:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "You got to be an Assistant first and then a HC.

The sugary drinks tax bill paves the way for South Africa to join the growing global movement of nations using fiscal policies to reduce consumption of unhealthy products while raising sorely needed revenues for social services like universal health coverage.\u201d \nSouth Africa\u2019s sugary drinks tax is scheduled to be implemented on 1 April 2018 and will lead to an estimated 11% increase in the price of a regular can of soft drink. \nMore than 30 countries have either introduced a tax on sugary drinks or, like South Africa, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United Arab Emirates, passed legislation to implement such a fiscal policy. A larger group of countries, including the Philippines, Antigua, Nepal and Seychelles, are considering introducing a tax on sugary drinks. \nWHO recommends governments to introduce effective taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages to help reduce excessive sugar intake. In South Africa, WHO has been supporting the introduction of such taxes since it was proposed by the National Treasury in August 2016 together with many local and international academics and NGOs. To develop and raise awareness about the bill, a detailed consultation process was conducted with all stakeholders, taking into account the concerns of labour unions, employers and all South Africans, whose health will benefit from the intervention. \nExperience from other countries that have implemented the tax demonstrates its potential to reduce consumption of sugar and raise revenues that can be used to prevent and control diabetes, obesity and other NCDs. \n\u201cWHO will continue working with South Africa to implement measures that protect children and adults alike from avoidable health risks, like sugary drinks, unhealthy diets, tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol and physical inactivity,\u201d adds Dr Chatora. \nTaxation on SSB is just one of a range of cost-effective measures proposed by WHO to curb the threat of NCDs, responsible for the deaths of 16 million people every year before the age of 70. \nOther interventions targeting obesity include nutrition labelling; marketing restrictions of unhealthy foods and beverages to kids; fruit and vegetable subsidies; physical activity policies and social marketing campaigns. At the World Health Assembly in 2017, such measures were endorsed as part of the \u201cBest buys\u201d and other recommended interventions for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases \nWHO Member States around the world, including South Africa, have committed to halt the rise of obesity and diabetes, reduce premature deaths from NCDs by 25% by 2025 and one-third by 2030, the latter target in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.

Rehabilitation of prisoners and training of inmates is very important to us and we would continue to invest more on this.  \n``I asked one of the inmates (released) how old he was and he told me he is only 19 years old. ``If we have people of 18 and 19 years in the prison, and there is no continuous training, then their lives will be completely destroyed. We will invest more in education and vocational training,\u2019\u2019 he said. \nThe 500 inmates granted pardon, including men and women, were drawn from various prisons in Kano state, including Kurmawa prisons, which has 1,398 inmates as opposed to 750, the established capacity.  \nEarlier, the President who arrived Kano to a tumultuous welcome by the Government and people of the State at the start of a two-day state visit paid homage to the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II. At the Emir\u2019s place, President Buhari recounted his fond memories of Kano, as a symbol of peace, trade, commerce and industry in Nigeria.  \n\u2018\u2018If there is a problem here, the whole country has a problem. I remember the industry and employment people get in Kano. \n\u2018\u2018Before the problem in the North East, I remember the number of articulated vehicles that leave this city to Maiduguri and the Cameroons, and the number of vehicles that come in from Chad and Niger, providing millions of jobs to Nigerians. \n\u2018\u2018A lot of people in Nigeria didn\u2019t realise how much the instability in the North East have cost the people and the industry here \u2019\u2019 he said. \nPresident Buhari, therefore, assured all Nigerians that the fight against the degraded Boko Haram will be sustained, in addition to the positive trends in the economy and the fight against corruption. \n\u2018\u2018The three things we said in our campaign on security, economy and fighting corruption, nobody will be able to successfully disabuse the minds of Nigerians on our clear intentions for our country and our people,\u2019\u2019 the President declared. \n\n\n", "highlightText": "",

7, 2017 Share More > Vote Interested locals have to be over the age of 18 and submit an online application on www.mbrsc.ae/astronauts The UAE has made another out-of-this-world announcement. quite literally this time. The search is on for potential Emirati astronauts in the country who will be heading to the International Space Station (ISS) within the next five years. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, made the historic announcement on Wednesday and launched the UAE Astronaut Programme, in which four Emirati astronauts will be selected. Sheikh Mohammed is inviting young Emiratis to register for the UAE Astronaut Programme through the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) at www.mbrsc.ae/astronauts. Interested locals have to be over the age of 18 and submit an online application. The shortlisted ones will go through a series of medical, psychometric and interview tests and the final four will be chosen by the end of 2018. The finalists of the programme will go through training in theory, science, specialty qualification for several months. The four will join the ISS on the first UAE space mission ever, to share knowledge and experience with other global astronauts. The astronauts will enhance the UAE's space sector achievements by undertaking scientific experiments within an integrated project, aimed at exploring biology and ways of adapting living organisms in non-terrestrial environments. The UAE Astronaut Programme is one of many space exploration projects that have been launched in the country; however, this is the first of its kind where Emiratis will step into space. \"On this day, a new chapter in our history begins with the launch of the first UAE Astronaut Programme, dedicated to training and sending four Emirati astronauts into space. The people of the UAE will break barriers; there is no power strong enough to stand in the way of those who believe nothing is impossible.\" He continued, \"Our ambitious goals are fuelled by dedicated people, who support us until, without hesitation or scepticism, we succeed,\" Sheikh Mohammed said. \"The most competitive applicants will be selected to be ambassadors for the UAE in space exploration. However, every single Emirati will contribute in his or her own way to the future of the UAE, whether it's on land or in the skies.\" The programme is part of the UAE National Space Programme, which was launched last April by Sheikh Mohammed and His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces. The UAE National Space Programme also includes the establishment of the Mars Science City. The Arab Space Exploration Programme is also part of UAE's space exploration projects. The Emirates Mars Mission is another project, in which an unmanned space probe called Hope will be launched in July 2020 to orbit Mars. sarwat@khaleejtimes.com ", "highlightText": "",

Williams Jr. had his fourth double-double to lead Duquesne to a 73-59 win over Stetson on Wednesday night. \nWilliams had 11 points, a career-high 16 rebounds, four assists and two steals for Duquesne (4-3). Mike Lewis II added 17 points, including four 3s. \nLewis made a 3-pointer to open the scoring and the Dukes never trailed. Six Duquesne players scored - including two 3s by Smith - during a 16-5 run that made it 37-21 late in the first half and the Hatters trailed by at least nine points throughout the second half. Divine Myles made back-to-back layups before Abayomi Iyiola added another to trim Stetson's deficit to 49-40 with 14 minutes to go, but Smith scored seven consecutive points to push the lead to 16 points and Jordan Robinson's dunk made it 70-50 with 1:52 remaining. \nMyles, the lone Stetson (6-5) player to score in double figures, had 22 points on 10-of-17 shooting. The rest of the Hatters starters combined to shoot 21.7 percent from the field. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A new extended look at \" Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom \" has been shared, just a day before the official trailer is scheduled to be released. Taking us behind the scenes of the making of the \" Jurassic World \" sequel, it shows how intense the movie will be with more and new dinosaurs. \"This is gonna be awesome,\" Chris Pratt 's Owen Grady gushes when he meets one of the new dinosaurs, before things turn chaotic when a volcano erupts. A T-rex is on the loose and Owen runs for his life in real footage from the movie. \"We're literally blowing up the island,\" Pratt says of an intense scene in the movie. Director Juan Antonio Bayona also talks about the challenge of making the movie. \"The challenge of making a sequel is finding the right balance between what people are expecting and what people will be surprised by,\" he shares. One of the highlights of the sneak-peek video is the return of Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm. \"I had to overcome the impact of being in front of Ian Malcolm,\" Bayona says of working with the franchise vet. \"After so many years, Jeff Goldblum was in front of a camera again talking about dinosaurs!\" The second \"Jurassic World\" movie is written by Derek Connolly and Trevorrow. Bryce Dallas Howard returns as Claire Dearing and B. D.
