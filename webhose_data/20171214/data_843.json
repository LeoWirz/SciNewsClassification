Matt Goins AP Photo Kentucky lawyer who vanished pleads not guilty to escape By BRUCE SCHREINER Associated Press December 07, 2017 03:43 AM UPDATED 1 MINUTE AGO LEXINGTON, Ky. \nA Kentucky lawyer who vanished for six months made his first court appearance Wednesday since he was caught as he faces the consequences for his role in a Social Security fraud case. \nEric Conn was in a federal courtroom in Lexington, Kentucky, the day after he was flown back to the United States following his capture outside a Pizza Hut in Honduras. \nConn's legal woes now go beyond his plea deal in the massive fraud case. He now faces escape and failure to appear charges outlined in an indictment unsealed in October while the attorney was still missing. Conn's attorney, Scott White, entered a not guilty plea to those charges during the hearing. \nWhite later told reporters that Conn was calm when they met for about 40 minutes before the hearing.

SUBSCRIBE NOW \n\"He's obviously sad that he's back here in the sense of having to deal with this stuff that he thought he had put behind him,\" White said. \nConn, 57, was handcuffed and wore a yellow jail outfit at the hearing. After taking his seat, he looked around the courtroom and nodded toward the prosecution team. Conn only spoke when asked questions by the U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert E. Wier and offered brief replies. \nWier set a bond violation hearing in Conn's case for Dec. 28. \nWhite told reporters that he's anticipating that federal prosecutors will attempt to pursue more than a dozen charges against Conn that would have been dropped as part of his original plea deal. If Conn is ultimately convicted on those charges as well as the escape-related charges, he could face a potential life sentence, White said. \nProsecutors will present court filings to indicate whether they intend to pursue those original charges. \nA federal prosecutor declined to comment after the hearing. \nWhite said that he intends to fight any efforts to have Conn face those charges. \n\"That completely changes the tenor of what we've got to do,\" White said. \nConn was sentenced in absentia last summer to a 12-year prison term for stealing from the government and bribing a judge as part of the more than $500 million Social Security fraud case. \n\"Here's a guy that really rolled the dice,\" White said, \"because the deal we got for him is he was going to do no more than 85 percent of 12 years.\" \nHe said when he met with Conn on Wednesday morning, Conn asked about his mother and had questions about the case and where he'll be held. \nWhite said he does not know how long Conn was in Honduras or whether he'd taken refuge anywhere else. \nWhite said Conn started serving his 12-year sentence as soon as he was transferred to the custody of the U.S. government. \nConn was handcuffed and wore blue jeans and a blue jacket Tuesday evening as he arrived back in Kentucky at Blue Grass Airport in Lexington, according to media reports. \nAs reporters shouted questions at him, Conn said: \"It's good to be home,\" according to WSAZ-TV. \nConn fled on June 2 when he cut off his electronic ankle monitor. \nOne of Conn's former employees, Curtis Lee Wyatt, is facing charges of helping in Conn's escape. \nHis capture has been cheered by his former clients and their families, who have struggled to make ends meet while fighting to keep their Social Security disability checks. \nConn, who started his law practice in a trailer in 1993, had portrayed himself as \"Mr. Social Security.\" He fueled that flamboyant persona with outlandish TV commercials and small-scale replicas of the Statue of Liberty and the Lincoln Memorial at his office in eastern Kentucky. \nConn represented thousands in successful claims for Social Security benefits. \nBut his empire crumbled when authorities discovered he had been bribing a doctor and a judge to approve disability claims based on fake medical evidence. \nAmong his former clients in the impoverished coalfields of eastern Kentucky and West Virginia are many people with legitimate disabilities. \nNed Pillersdorf, an attorney representing many of Conn's former clients, has said Conn caused a \"true humanitarian crisis.\" As part of the fallout, the Social Security Administration identified about 1,500 beneficiaries who were made to undergo hearings, he said. Pillersdorf said those hearings are nearly complete, and about 700 have been found eligible to maintain the benefits.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eric conn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "curtis lee wyatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott white", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert e. wier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pillersdorf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt goins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bruce schreiner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ned pillersdorf", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "social security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social security administration", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ky.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lexington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honduras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blue grass airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lincoln memorial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lexington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ky", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:35.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a90c864eff30c5a71c4fceb9fb9f8efb0590bc72", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.91026zXfsQ52DTI59KEh06jHjEail1m9DONe35eqU4NT5i9XYP9PSDu305_dmnBsUOo.MmZ7JqOhrvncDLT5", "site_full": "www.gamefaqs.com", "site": "gamefaqs.com", "site_section": "https://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/210930-pokemon-ultra-sun", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Pokemon Ultra Sun Message Board for 3DS -

World health Organization (WHO) estimates that the global prevalence of diabetes is increased to 8.5% in 2014 as compared to 4.7% in 1980. Diabetes is identified as one of the major cause of lower extremity (LE) or peripheral edema, venous insufficiency and deep vein thrombosis, leading to multiple or combined etiologies. Compression therapy is a non-invasive treatment regime to improve the blood circulation in patients suffering from diabetes, varicose veins, and spider veins thus maintaining desired pressure in the feet\u2019s and legs. Compression socks accelerate venous blood flow by providing a gently graduated support to leg veins and valves creating improved blood flow. Compression socks are available in varying degrees of compression ranging from mild to higher levels of compression. \nView Report Preview @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/compression-socks-market.asp \nThe levels of compression are expressed in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), and different levels of compression socks are used in a treatment of different medical conditions. A mild level compression therapy (up to 25mmHg) is used to relieve the symptoms of swelled and paining legs, varicose and spider vein. High levels of compression therapy, greater than 25mmHg is considered contradiction for a diabetic patient. The low-level compression therapy socks do not require a physician\u2019s prescription while higher therapeutic compression socks are not sold without the doctor\u2019s prescription. Compression socks are available in various fits and sizes are often considered as the first line of treatment for varicose veins, spider veins, and edema in patients with diabetes. Apart from this compression therapy is largely exploited by athletes with venous insufficiency. The compression socks market is expected to generate substantial revenues over the forecast period. \nThe overall cost of diagnosis of diabetes remains as high as $245 billion in the U.S. in 2012. Diabetes remains one of the foremost accelerating factors for compression socks market growth. A diabetic patient is at higher risk of developing venous insufficiency, peripheral edema, and DVT. Therefore, wearing compression socks delivers desired pressure at the foot and less pressure at the calves maintaining proper blood circulation. This prevents swelling and improves any nerve sensitivities. Furthermore, compression socks are cheaper and much simpler than alternative treatment therapies and hence remain the most popular choice of the patients with DVT and other prophylaxis. Additionally, increasing use of compression socks among athletes with the prime focus on improving the venous return by applying graduated compression around the calves is expected to drive the market for compression socks over the forecast period. \nPresently, some manufacturers are focusing on providing custom fit compression socks according to the patients need. This is expected to reflect positive growth in the global compression socks market. Such compression socks are available in various sizes and are highly used due to extended comfort and ease of use. The market for compression socks may witness declining revenues owing to use of poorly fitted socks. Thigh length fitted socks, incorrect shape and size can lead to increased risk of thrombosis. Also, inadequate reimbursement options available for compression socks is further expected to hamper the market growth. \nRequest to View Sample of Research Report @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/13648 \nCompression socks market is expected to exhibit significant market growth over the forecast period attributed to high incidence of venous diseases such as DVT among rowing number of diabetic and aged group population. Greater penetration of compression therapy among patients also decreases the number of amputation rate. \nBy product type, the global market for compression socks has been classified into knee high, thigh high, pantyhose/ maternity and waist attachment. Knee high socks product type segment is highly preferred product type segment owing to better patient compliance with regards to the better fit of the socks type. \nBy compression level, the global market for compression socks has been classified into mild compression, moderate compression, firm compression and strong/extra firm compression. The level of compression depends on the severity of the disease condition. \nBy distribution channel the global compression socks market is segmented into, hospital pharmacies, retail pharmacies and online channels. Hospital pharmacies remain the primary distribution channel for compression socks. \nBy regional presence, global compression socks market is segmented into five key regions viz. North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. North America will continue to dominate the global compression socks market attributed to growing number of diabetic patients and rising awareness among patients and physicians regarding the efficacy of compression socks therapy in the treatment of edema and venous insufficiency. 20-30mmHg is the most prescribed compression level among patients with venous insufficiency. This compression level range is also used among patients with venous thrombosis during extended travel. Growing obesity rates and increasing prevalence of diabetes, result in venous and diabetic ulcers leading to greater penetration of use of compression therapy in the region. Rising awareness among growing number of an individual regarding the DVT coupled with rising aging population is creating more demand for compression hosiery in European countries. Asia Pacific is expected to be the fastest growing region in global compression socks market. \nSome of the major players operating in the global compression socks market are FLA Orthopedics, Inc., Sigvaris, Juzo, 2XU Pty. Ltd. JOBST USA, Prime Compression, Bio Compression Systems, Inc., and COMFORT PLUS CORPORATION.

How can companies undertake effective staff development in today's business culture? \nThe demands on the modern worker are very different to those of a few decades ago. It is estimated that approximately thirty percent of employees now work at multiple sites, sometimes in remote locations. Many businesses actively encourage working from home and flexible working practices to support employees who are looking for a better work/life balance. Within this business culture, traditional training and development channels very often don't work. \nBusiness leaders are now acknowledging that a happy employee becomes a long-term member of staff. A key tool in the creation of the 'happy employee' is the ability to provide continuous support and training. This principle is backed-up by research in the UK, which showed 74% of UK workers felt they had not reached their potential and wished they were receiving more job training. A second study, conducted in Canada, revealed that around 40% of employees, who did not receive adequate training, left their posts within a year. \nFor businesses, workforce development can be the difference between success and failure. So, if business success is linked to training and development, why do so many employees report they are dissatisfied. The problem is not necessarily investment. For example, the 2013 Corporate Learning Factbook reported that US businesses spend more than $60 billion a year on employee development. On average, however, only one percent of the working week is devoted to training. \nThe problem may not be, therefore, the willingness to train but the approach to training. \nWhile many things can be done virtually in the digital age, physical interaction remains one of the best ways to learn. Communicating and developing relationships through personal interaction is one of the key reasons face-to-face learning continues to be a preferred methodology. Learners gain from the depth of information and experience that is imparted to them by the tutor. Tutors will have many years of experience in their field, which will enrich their tutorials in a way online learning cannot. This personal element allows learners to ask questions and receive an immediate response in the verbal language and style that they are comfortable with, therefore avoiding any problems of miscommunication or misinterpretation. \neLearning \nResearch shows that 70% of employees use search engines to learn on the job and most people habitually use their smartphones to answer unexpected questions. Accessing information online has become the norm for many people and, with the traditional model for training no longer appropriate in modern businesses, it is natural for companies to turn to eLearning to fill the gap. \nThe flexibility afforded by eLearning means it provides a number of benefits to both the employee and the employer. \nFor the employee, it: \nPersonalizes the learning experience Gives them control over when, and how, learning takes place Aligns with their daily schedules for accessing information Provides a greater sense of connectivity, especially relevant for employees working in isolation or in remote locations For the business or organization, it: \nMakes it easy to reach staff at multiple locations Provides trackable and measurable results Delivers training that upskills employees Ties learning into behavioral changes and business results A Mixture of Both - Blended Learning \nOrganizations need to be willing to change the way they train their staff if they are to succeed. Josh Bersin cites the examples of Nokia and countless search engine businesses, who held highly trained workforces but were finally out-innovated by the business cultures at Apple and Google. These companies developed training cultures that progressed the individual and the business, adapting to the changes around them. \nFor many organizations, the answer to successful training will be blended learning. Companies are able to choose the balance, ensuring alignment with both the requirements of the business and their employee's needs, using a combination of traditional and high-tech learning solutions. The workforce then receives the training it needs, but in a format that is less stressful and more appropriate to their working lifestyle. \nA face-to-face tutor can help further develop knowledge gained through eLearning by adding real-life examples, gained from personal experience. The tutor can also ensure new knowledge is being implemented in a manner that is suitable for the learner and the business. During this process, the tutor, as the conduit between employer and employee, is also able to assess the success of the learning solution for each student. The freedom to learn in this way has been shown to develop a more self-sufficient and result-orientated workforce. \nThe world of corporate training is changing, just as the work environment is changing. With staff no longer situated at one location, and with an increasing dependence on online resources, companies need to adapt the way they train to meet these new challenges. Companies, such as SGS, are developing a range of options to provide training that works around both the needs of the employer and the needs of the employee. Flexibility is key, as everyone is an individual and every business has a different culture. eLearning will provide employees with a more conducive studying environment that fits around their normal habits but, at the same time, the use of face-to-face training, drawn from the more traditional forms of instruction, will help employees to utilise their learning effectively. \nFor more information, contact: \nAmanda Mangan\nGlobal Training Manager\nt: +44 (0) 1276 697707 / 06 \nReferences: \nHow Investing In Employee Training Benefits Your Business \nHow Corporate Learning Drives Competitive Advantage \n5 Ways Blended Learning Benefits Corporate Training \nSGS SA published this content on 07 December 2017 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.\nDistributed by Public, unedited and unaltered, on 07 December 2017 10:01:08 UTC . \nOriginal document http://www.sgs.com/en/news/2017/12/benefits-of-corporate-training-face-to-face-and-elearning \nPublic permalink http://www.publicnow.com/view/FB4E79AD19D42A041AC540E6B06DB323DD7D245A", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amanda mangan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh bersin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blended learning  organizations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nokia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sgs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ways blended learning benefits corporate training  sgs sa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:35.017+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "82130291bc3a9224814c03e2b5f8a214053bc780", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg999YYspK0ijSseSh6BN._3..Pn5xxIlZUylUIud8S5FE8y1GZCCyV4TMKbcTloHRpcdRu1Tktc2U_WIpe20qt89.33xGaMXsFhfGSykJfXUPlLj1zLhhzj", "site_full": "www.poandpo.com", "site": "poandpo.com", "site_section": "http://poandpo.com/rss-articles/", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "POST Online Media", "title": "Analogic Corporation posts 77% increase in Q1 profit", "title_full": "Analogic Corporation posts 77% increase in Q1 profit", "published": "2017-12-07T05:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "HR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "82130291bc3a9224814c03e2b5f8a214053bc780", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg999YYspK0ijSseSh6BN._3..Pn5xxIlZUylUIud8S5FE8y1GZCCyV4TMKbcTloHRpcdRu1Tktc2U_WIpe20qt89.33xGaMXsFhfGSykJfXUPlLj1zLhhzj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T05:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "Analogic Corporation posts 77% increase in Q1 profit", "text": "Analogic Bottom line totaled $9.50 million Analogic Corporation posts 77% increase in Q1 profit Staff Writer | Thursday December 7, 2017 3:13AM ET Analogic Corporation reported a profit for its first quarter that climbed from last year.

Morgan led by Jay Barry. They found its place at the top gave way this year to an inflation reading, which has overtaken the jobs report\u2019s role as a driver of Federal Reserve policy actions.\n\u201cYields have become more sensitive to core CPI (consumer-price index) surprises as focus has turned to the inflation side of the Fed\u2019s dual mandate,\u201d the fixed-income strategists said. Core CPI measures consumer prices excluding the volatile food and energy categories.\nTheir findings reflect that even as the gap between a solid economy and muted inflation have widened, investors have grown increasingly sensitive to signs of price increases. After the unemployment rate hit multidecade lows, the Fed and investors have concentrated on a lack of accompanying wage increases, the force expected to spur inflation and the central bank to normalize rates.\nAs a result, the three most important readings to bond traders now are core CPI and two underlying contributors, retail sales and average hourly earnings, the analysts said. \nThey found that over the last three years, the 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% would move at least 1.5 basis points in the two hours after any one of those three pieces of economic data performed better or worse than expected, that is, delivered a surprise (see table below). One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.\nJ.P. Morgan The influence of nonfarm payrolls on bond markets has evaporated In contrast, jobless claims, nonfarm payrolls data and the unemployment rate had weak explanatory power for Treasurys trading after a data release. The regression coefficient, or \u201cfit\u201d, for the nonfarm payrolls number plummeted to 6% this year from 46% in the prior two years, whereas the fit for the core CPI reading jumped to 58% in 2017 from 11% in the past two years.\nA higher regression coefficient implies that there is a much stronger relationship, or fit, between yield movements and a piece of economic data. \nIn effect, the analysis reveals a sea change in the drivers of the bond market, which unlike stocks are more sensitive to the swings and sways of the overall economy. A few years ago, job market data ruled the roost when slack was noticeably absent in an economy still recovering from the depths of the 2007-2009 recession.\nBut after the unemployment rate fell to unforeseen lows this year and inflation shrugged off the tightening labor market, the traditional relationship between low unemployment and rising inflation was thrown out of the window. \n\u201cIf unemployment goes further down without inflation going up, its kind of business as usual,\u201d said Marvin Loh, senior fixed-income strategist at BNY Mellon.\nPersonal-consumption expenditures stripping out for energy and food prices, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, saw a 1.3% annual rise in the three months between July and September , below the central bank\u2019s 2% target, even as the unemployment rate hit 4.1% in October .\nThe string of tepid inflation reports have concerned Fed officials who see it as harbinger of a more lasting trend. Outgoing Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen last week expressed concerns about stubbornly below-target inflation. If it remains subdued, the impetus to raise and continue normalizing interest rates may not be apparent, she said.\nRead : Yellen says inflation below 2% goal poses one of Fed\u2019s \u2018biggest challenges\u2019 \nYet it might be dangerous to assign too much importance to inflation in the coming months. The central bank has raised rates twice in 2017 even against lackluster data on the basis that raising rates too gradually could overheat the labor market and put the Fed behind the curve.\n\u201cEverything the Fed says, we\u2019re going to overlook the short-term data bounces, so the market is now looking past the data,\u201d said Loh.\nRelated Topics U.S. Stocks Markets NY Stock Exchange NASDAQ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yellen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marvin loh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay barry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet yellen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.p. morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bny mellon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "related topics u.s. stocks markets ny stock exchange nasdaq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "outgoing federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:35.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa2666f406dff981f6f3896466c2356bb93dc314", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxa_6uqa44D1gwHgRNnJBWuQ4rE3HBYcqO2HY5Tu.g0ygoOMO11cwRv92GB8zk5vymX9y1g0F80uZACZV_Ftrw_", "site_full": "forum.doctissimo.fr", "site": "doctissimo.fr", "site_section": "http://forum.doctissimo.fr/loisirs/Jeux/liste_sujet-1.htm", "site_categories": ["tennis", "sports"], "section_title": "Forum Jeux -

The tree is up and most of the presents have been bought and wrapped. Inspired by Nigella and her year round twinkly lights, I've also put some fairy lights up in the kitchen this year, however, in my enthusiasm, I appear to have achieved the look of Santa's Grotto rather than Nigella's cosy kitchen. The husband is none too chuffed by my efforts to be super festive as I'm yet to introduce smart plugs into the kitchen, and there are a grand total of 7 sockets to turn off at the end of the night! \nI've not yet dug out my spreadsheet for the Christmas food, but that part of the planning will hopefully get underway over the weekend. I'm not catering for as many guests on the big day this year but I'm sure that won't stop me making plenty of desserts, resulting in me inadvertently consuming far too many calories. \nAccording to Consultant Dietician Helen Bond, on average people gain  between 1 and 5lbs over Christmas, and I've definitely been closer to the latter in previous years. This year I'm aiming for zero weight gain, so I need to be a little bit clever, as I don't want to miss out on all of the treats. \nReducing your sugar intake over Christmas can be a little tricky but by substituting sugar in desserts and drinks with Splenda \u00ae  granulated low calorie sweetener means that you can still enjoy a few sweet treats, without the extra calories. As Splenda \u00ae  is made with sucralose it's heat stable up to 232 degrees C, making it an ideal replacement for sugar in cakes and bakes. \n\nThere are lots of recipes and ideas on the Splenda website, including Chocolate Swirl Cheesecake , Mince Pies , Mulled Wine Jelly and Christmas Trifle , which would all be perfect for Christmas entertaining. \nI decided to make the Christmas Trifle, and instead of making one large trifle I made smaller ones in cocktail glasses. Making individual desserts is a not only a more attractive way to serve trifle, it's also a great way to ensure that you don't eat one spoonful too many! \n\n\nMy version of the trifle also includes Amaretto in place of Sherry, Madeira or Masala, as I absolutely love Amaretto, and the almond flavour goes really well with the spiced plums. I must admit that despite making trifle every Christmas I can take it or leave it really. I certainly don't like trifle with jelly in, and many trifles are really heavy, however this version, without the layer of cream on top, was much lighter, and the spiced plum layer was quite tart and paired well with the sweet custard. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelen Bond\u2019s top 10 tips for negotiating festive feasting; from daily treats to New Year\u2019s toast. Top Tips: 1.      Always start the day with a healthy breakfast.   It\u2019s easy to miss this important meal, or give in and indulge in fatty croissants  to ease that Christmas party hangover. B ut eating a good breakfast will help kick-start your metabolism  and  keep you feeling full, making it easier to ignore the inevitable chocolates lying around.   \n\n2.      Get creative with your advent calendar.  Even big kids love opening those little advent calendar doors \u2013 but, enjoying 25 days of chocolaty goodness will do your waistline no favours! A little  chocolate  Xmas character  provides around 26 kcals, 1.5g fat, 2.8g sugar - even more if they are truffle or alcoholic filled \u2013 that\u2019s an extra 650 kcals, 37.5g fat and 70g sugar over 25 days. Why not get creative with your countdown to Christmas, so you\u2019ve got a daily treat , without the daily guilt.  \n\n3.      Love seasonal fruit and veg.  With the abundance of festive food, it can be easy to forget the basics of eating healthily and achieving the (at least) 5-a-day recommendation. I like to pile the veg on my plate first, rather than last. \n\n4.      Make time for exercise.  However well you plan, life is going to get hectic over the festive period, so schedule your 2.5 hours of moderate intensity exercise into your week now. Exercise is also a fabulous stress buster, as it releases endorphins, making you feel happier and calmer.  \n\n5.      Don\u2019t skip meals .   If you\u2019re going to the office party straight after work, or you\u2019ve got a dinner date with friends, don\u2019t ditch lunch for fear of overdoing your daily calorie intake. You\u2019ll be famished and hungry people tend to make bad food decisions. \n\n6.      Try not to burn the candle at both ends.   Burning the festive candle at both ends, with parties during the week and weekend hosting duties, can also affect your waistline. Too little sleep can reduce the level of the appetite-controlling hormone leptin and increase the  hormone ghrelin, telling the brain you need to eat \u2013 and not always the right healthy food choices. \n\n7.       Rethink your tea breaks.  Cut c utting down on the \u2018white stuff\u2019   is a tall order, especially around Christmas. It appears in so many of the traditional  festive  favourites, that it\u2019s near impossible  to keep track of how much you\u2019re eating.  An easy win is to rethink your tea breaks; i nstead of adding sugar to your tea, swap to a low-calorie sweetener, like  SPLENDA\u00ae.  If you drink four cups of  tea a day with two teaspoons (8g) of sugar in each cup - that adds up to 128 kcals .  Your sweet tea also tots up to nearly one 1kg bag of sugar over the 25 days of December and 3,200 kcals! You, and your Xmas shopping could be a whole lot lighter for a simple sweet swap! \n\n8.      Treat sweets as treats .   The constant supply of treats from guests and  salty savoury snacks  at work can be too tempting to avoid. Keep healthier seasonal snacks, like clementines, to hand;  a medium clementine has just 25 kcals and will provide you 31% of your daily needs for immune boosting vitamin C and 1g of gut healthy fibre. \n\n9.      Wise-up to  the buffet.   Faced with a buffet, resist the temptation to start filling your plate at one end of the table and continuing to add to it until you reach the other. Before you pick up the plate (and always take the smallest one!), pause for a moment and then prioritise healthy choices;  smoked salmon, slices of lean ham and vegetable crudit\u00e9s. Now,  step away. \n10.   Keep in mind portion size.   Most of us are over-generous with serving sizes at Christmas and it\u2019s a fact that the bigger your tableware, the more you\u2019ll fill it. Research shows that simply downsizing  from a 12 to 10-inch plate could help you eat roughly 22% fewer calories, and you\u2019ll not feel like you are missing out .   \nVisit www.splenda.co.uk/recipes for more delicious recipe inspiration & baking tips. \n\n\nCommissioned post for  SPLENDA\u00ae Copyright www.thecrazykitchen.co.uk If you would like a free 14 day trial to The Crazy Kitchen delivered straight to your Kindle please click here ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nigella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helen bond", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "splenda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madeira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "splenda", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:36.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b199860d69d33a1ea297e5096cf3e95bb26df92f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XvOP.xSLZ1wAqY9j1Yfxmk5dmGeuCdNF3CF8eCjyldM_lTHiaTRqrArX7Xz8RL6yVxp_M8GAyAf1haXk4dB7FUsZB2BV.V6ufQvyBOvbBoUgB4XDF481nrXrNRuVd09u6MtBgJvKo1Q--", "site_full": "www.canadianinquirer.net", "site": "canadianinquirer.net", "site_section": "http://www.canadianinquirer.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "immigration"], "section_title": "Philippine Canadian Inquirer", "title": "Artificial intelligence to fuel a new cybersecurity race, say expert", "title_full": "Artificial intelligence to fuel a new cybersecurity race, say expert", "published": "2017-12-07T12:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.canadianinquirer.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/hand-2692450_640.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b199860d69d33a1ea297e5096cf3e95bb26df92f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XvOP.xSLZ1wAqY9j1Yfxmk5dmGeuCdNF3CF8eCjyldM_lTHiaTRqrArX7Xz8RL6yVxp_M8GAyAf1haXk4dB7FUsZB2BV.V6ufQvyBOvbBoUgB4XDF481nrXrNRuVd09u6MtBgJvKo1Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bea Kirstein Manalaysay", "published": "2017-12-07T12:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "Artificial intelligence to fuel a new cybersecurity race, say expert", "text": "By Ross Marowits , The Canadian Press on December 7, 2017 Experts expect machines will become so sophisticated that they\u2019ll develop answers to questions that humans won\u2019t clearly understand (Pixabay photo) \nMONTREAL \u2014 Technological advances in artificial intelligence are fuelling a new race between hackers and those toiling to protect cybersecurity networks. \nCybersecurity is always a race between offence and defence but new tools are giving companies that employ them a leg up on those trying to steal their data. \nWhereas past responses to cybercrimes often looked for known hacking methods long after they occurred, AI techniques using machine learning scan huge volumes of data to detect patterns of abnormal behaviour that are imperceptible to humans. \nExperts expect machines will become so sophisticated that they\u2019ll develop answers to questions that humans won\u2019t clearly understand. \nDavid Decary-Hetu, assistant professor of criminology at the University of Montreal, says defenders have an edge right now in using artificial intelligence. \n\u201cBut who knows what\u2019s going to happen in a few years from now,\u201d he said in an interview. \n\u201cThe main issue is that if you\u2019re defending a system you have to be good 100 per cent of the time, but when you\u2019re attacking the system you only have to be successful once to get in.\u201d \nDecary-Hetu said a growing list of corporate and government officials, including Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz, who say infiltrations are their top worry have a very good reason to fear. \nThe Bank of Canada warned in its semi-annual review released this month that the high degree of interconnectedness among Canadian financial institutions means any successful cyberattack could spread widely throughout the financial system. \nReports suggest cybercrime costs the Canadian economy between $3 billion and $5 billion a year, including ransom paid to foreign criminals. \nHacks of Sony Pictures, Uber, Ashley Madison, Yahoo and multinational retailers have sparked unsettling headlines about security of personal information. \nOne of the latest to face scrutiny is global credit-reporting firm Equifax. Hackers accessed the personal information, including names, social insurance and credit card numbers, as well as usernames, passwords and secret question/secret answer data of 19,000 Canadians and 145.5 million Americans. \nCurrent detection systems tend to only recognize improper activity based on past events, often long after the damage is done. \nAn example of this is Equifax, which discovered the breach in July, months after hackers first infiltrated the system. It only notified the public in early September. \nNiranjan Mayya, founder and CEO of Toronto-based Rank Software, said it takes on average 143 days for a breach to be detected. \nThe challenge is growing as the number of connected devices in the world continues to soar. \n\u201cClearly the old style techniques of looking at cybersecurity threats and having people go through each threat aren\u2019t working anymore, so automated means of detecting threats has become more and more important,\u201d he said. \nDavid Masson, Canadian manager for U.K.-based Darktrace, said artificial intelligence will help to keep up with threats by quickly identifying and stopping attacks by picking up on subtle markers that identify bad behaviour. \nHe said his company\u2019s systems map a customer\u2019s entire network, including every user and device, to discern even the slightest deviations as they emerge. \nMasson said AI is needed to keep up with threats by automating defence responses to growing machine-on-machine attacks launched by sophisticated hackers. \n\u201cYou\u2019re kind of looking at a cyber arms race,\u201d he said in an interview. \n\u201cIf you want to keep up with this threat and put the advantage back in the hands of the defenders you\u2019re gonna have to use AI.\u201d \nOntario-based utilities company Energy+ Inc. said installed Darktrace technology alerted it to a user going to a malware site in Russia and uploading undisclosed sensitive data to a third-party cloud provider that its existing security was unable to catch. \nSome observers temper the current exuberance about AI, saying it\u2019s not a silver bullet and these are nascent days for the technology. \nReceptiviti CEO Jonathan Kreindler says the hype around artificial intelligence has accelerated and has almost become a branding exercise for some companies that aren\u2019t even offering truly leading edge technology. \n\u201cThe term AI is now being applied to any sort of algorithmic reasoning unfortunately,\u201d said Kreindler. \nHis firm uses AI to scour writings for unconscious use of language to understand the psychological state of company insiders who are responsible for 80 per cent of cybersecurity issues. \nCanada\u2019s largest IT company, CGI Group, said artificial intelligence is a growing field of interest for customers, although the average client is in the fairly early stages of considering AI adoption in cybersecurity. \nCGI cybersecurity expert Andrew Rogoyski said that still puts them one step ahead of most hackers, who are typically interested in stealing data using the cheapest tools possible. \nRogoyski added that he expects a strengthening of defensive mechanisms might force hackers to also adopt innovative techniques such as AI. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a race, it\u2019s been going on for 20 years plus and the race just keeps evolving. We keep leapfrogging each other,\u201d he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ross marowits", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen poloz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan kreindler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashley madison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "masson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rogoyski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew rogoyski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david decary-hetu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kreindler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "decary-hetu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david masson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niranjan mayya", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "the canadian press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rank software", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.-based darktrace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yahoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank of canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of montreal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energy+ inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cgi group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sony pictures", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "montreal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darktrace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:36.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8aeeea5bb99c5ce9b9bf13b126f5774aee884e36", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8xMR_zqDhVU24R8Gr303y2eFJY60f.Y2rinaIrlVl4LtVyrt1q21PW5FRMEg03y0tVQFdKHdMmSacXfrQdvvfDltJUB3wWvwLrS4YTQzQKPaQZc3pfZuTpdlNj1whjFsJi6J2SnkhEgOgdFAFsYaOxAECXUYCzPZ383ne8cHoOowK6CyWyN8CFjChJfIU_YJVu0UpJjry0ro0pshXj5HogLvyylWUuQK_dDECGQvdqwQu7by5Ed.LnoFltz8qciAMvglpDywkfKT9TUctb6mMBqliRIxd2Y_OgcxffvHG5Tk2AGe2jbRsp", "site_full": "www.juxtapost.com", "site": "juxtapost.com", "site_section": "http://www.juxtapost.com/feed/id/global", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Juxtapost -

BriefingWire.com , 12/07/2017 - According to a new research study by Transparency Market Research (TMR), the rivalry between Johnson Matthey, Henkel AG & Co. KgaA, Heraeus Holding, and Kester define the competitive landscape of the global market for solder flux. A large number of established players with state-of-art technical capabilities operate in this highly fragmented market.\nThese players mostly benefit from their experience as they have gained proficiency in producing solder flux for electrical and electronic equipment. Going forward, they would engage more in mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships, which is likely to curtail the competition within this market a little in the near future, notes the study. \nTMR estimates the global market for solder flux offered an opportunity worth US$213.2 mn in 2015. Rising at a CAGR of 6.30% during the period from 2016 to 2024, the value of this market is likely to touch US$367.3 mn by the end of the forecast period.

They were making a political point about small business taxes, an issue they\u2019re pushing to be front and centre in South Surrey-White Rock. \n\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018I\u2019m paying a lot higher taxes than I was before. I\u2019m being called a tax cheat because I\u2019m an entrepreneur with a small business,'\u201d said Findlay, 62, a former national revenue minister. \nThe riding is one of four across Canada where a byelection will be held Monday, but it\u2019s anticipated to be the closest race. Conservative Dianne Watts won by just 1,400 votes over the Liberal candidate in 2015, while the NDP placed a distant third. \nThe vote arrives midway through Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s term and it\u2019s expected to test his popularity, as well as the potential of rookie leader Scheer, ahead of the 2019 election. Both men have visited the riding twice and both have suggested the outcome will indicate whether the Liberal surge of 2015 is continuing or waning. \n\u201cTwo years ago, in the election, Canadians didn\u2019t randomly or suddenly change who we are,\u201d Trudeau said at a recent rally to support Liberal candidate Gordie Hogg, 71. \n\u201cWe have always been progressive, forward-thinking, open, compassionate, ambitious people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just about getting a government that recognizes that.\u201d \nSouth Surrey-White Rock has older, wealthier and whiter demographics than other ridings in Surrey, which is the fastest-growing city in Metro Vancouver. It\u2019s home to a picturesque waterfront and an array of restaurants, shops and other small businesses. \nIn July, Trudeau\u2019s government announced plans to close loopholes that it said have allowed high-earning business owners to avoid higher taxes. The measures included changes to \u201cincome sprinkling,\u201d which allows owners to split income among family members. \nAfter a backlash, the government said it would cut the small business tax rate from 10.5 per cent to nine per cent by 2019. \nHogg said he and Trudeau are committed to cutting taxes for small businesses, while the Conservatives voted against a tax cut in 2015 for \u201cmiddle-class\u201d Canadians earning between about $45,000 and $90,000 a year. \n\u201cTo me, their record is more important than their rhetoric,\u201d said Hogg. \u201cThis byelection is about electing the strongest positive voice for our community, and only Justin Trudeau and I have a positive plan to strengthen our middle class and offer real help for families.\u201d \nThe seat became vacant after Watts resigned to run for leader of the B.C. Liberal Party, an informal coalition of federal Conservatives and Liberals. \nByelections will also be held in Battlefords-Lloydminster in Saskatchewan, previously held by the Conservatives; Bonavista-Burin-Trinity in Newfoundland, a Liberal seat; and Scarborough-Agincourt in Ontario, also won by the Liberals in the last election. \nIn South Surrey-White Rock, Hogg has name recognition and deep roots. He was White Rock mayor for 10 years before being elected to the B.C. legislature for two decades. Findlay, meantime, represented Delta-Richmond East in Parliament from 2011 to 2015. \nAsked about her connection to the riding, Findlay said her parents lived in the community and she has also lived there at various points, including after she was widowed at 34 and was raising her children alone. She said she moved to White Rock this summer. \nThe NDP candidate is Jonathan Silveira, 40, a real estate agent and founder of advocacy group Surrey Kids Matter. He said the byelection was an opportunity to train new volunteers and strengthen relationships, but added he was serious about winning. \n\u201cThere are two big sharks fighting here. I am not afraid of the fight as well,\u201d he said. \nNew Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh has not joined Silveira in the riding. \nTrudeau\u2019s recent rally with Hogg in Surrey drew hundreds. Some were not local voters, however, including a Syrian refugee who said she wanted to thank Trudeau, and a visitor from Singapore who wanted to see the famous Canadian politician in person. \nThe prime minister is pictured alongside Hogg on campaign signs, indicating confidence among Liberals in Trudeau\u2019s popularity. \nScheer and Findlay, however, said they\u2019ve heard from people who have \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d after voting Liberal in 2015. \nIt\u2019s hard to predict a general election based on byelections, Scheer added, because the latter generally have lower turnouts, and local issues become amplified over national ones. \n\u201cBut I think we would love to send a signal, mid-term, that what the Liberals have been doing for Canadians isn\u2019t working.\u201d Recent Articles", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "justin trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scheer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin trudeau/facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerry-lynne findlay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew scheer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dianne watts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gordie hogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jagmeet singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonavista-burin-trinity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "findlay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan silveira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silveira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watts", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "b.c. liberal party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surrey kids matter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ndp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "surrey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarborough-agincourt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metro vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south surrey-white rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "battlefords-lloydminster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newfoundland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saskatchewan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontario", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surrey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:36.035+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b9cc8363c167c5a93e68b8a48a76c65ac4dcc48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR2FAjBlNN2uM7WmwXuQU6FW0YKGk0Us.4jRD5LZ6ObKWSA33GX3bSEaEZ2H9LB9Kejtsr_IAUDRf3Noc.WJpzTfHsMQ4s.qzAo5tYLcTlF1zTLVJ8pkybr", "site_full": "autofile.ca", "site": "autofile.ca", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/Autofileca-NewsReviewsAndArticles", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Autofile.ca - News, Reviews and Articles", "title": "Rinspeed plans to unveil another quirky concept at CES", "title_full": "Rinspeed plans to unveil another quirky concept at CES", "published": "2017-12-07T04:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/autofile-communications-inc/image/upload/c_fit,h_683,w_1024/v1/article/article18050/d2pjz6vj61twlubggwbv.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4b9cc8363c167c5a93e68b8a48a76c65ac4dcc48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR2FAjBlNN2uM7WmwXuQU6FW0YKGk0Us.4jRD5LZ6ObKWSA33GX3bSEaEZ2H9LB9Kejtsr_IAUDRf3Noc.WJpzTfHsMQ4s.qzAo5tYLcTlF1zTLVJ8pkybr", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joe Duarte", "published": "2017-12-07T04:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Rinspeed plans to unveil another quirky concept at CES", "text": "Rinspeed plans to unveil another quirky concept at CES Snap has pod-like cabin that fastens/unfastens from skateboard-like base by Joe Duarte - December 7, 2017, 2:30 AM \nRinspeed, the Swiss company best known for quirky auto concepts such as the garden plot on wheels Oasis, and the underwater Squba, will be unveiling its latest concept Snap and the 2018 CES show in La Vegas in January. \nA with the latest Rinspeed concepts, Snap will address another possibility for autonomous driving \u2014 that they may become more than just transportation. Rinspeed\u2019s brain-trust, inventor/designer/programmer Frank M. Rinderknecht separates the hardware and software (integrated in a skateboard-like chassis) from the pod-like cabin, which can be removed for other uses, such as camping. \nAnd the two parts snap together, or are unsnapped from each other, as needed. Hence, the name. \nBut the notable part of Snap is that the skateboard part can be turned over as needed, due to the rapidly evolving nature of vehicle components, especially in recent years with all the various driving developments, and their constant wear and tear. Those components can be recycled once they reach the end of their useful lives and replaced with newer models, while the much more timeless pod can remain in service much longer and transferred to a new platform as warranted. \nThe electric Snap features two steering axles, allowing it to turn and manoeuvre in very tight quarters, and a Harman autonomous drive platform. It rides on18-inch Borbet wheels shod with low-resistance 225/35R18 tires. \nInformation to other road users (such as yielding right of way) is relayed via messages on the windshield and rear window, while projections on the side windows relay messages to passengers boarding the vehicle. \nCabin features include iris scanner for occupant detection, dimmable glass that eliminates the need for shades, and high-speed connectivity (5G, Car2X, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) for cabin occupants. It also offers connectivity to smart city infrastructure, other road users, connected health, and to facilitate secure transmission of high-definition, high-resolution multimedia assets. \nThe iris detection is part of 3-level authentication that allows for customizable displays for cabin occupants and allows the transfer of sometimes sensitive data. The system allows access to the interior via a token, then uses face recognition to identify the user. \nEach user has three displays at their disposal (two of them centrally located for all occupants to watch the route navigation and entertainment feeds, such as movies), with personal preferences selected through a personal control panel with an interactive control dial. Personal contents and messages are accessed through hover pads brought into position by swivelling arms. Audio is provided through a Lexicon surround sound system. \nInnovative lighting solutions includes the use of ultraviolet LED interior lighting to sterilize bacteria and thereby improve hygiene, which is important toward the maintenance of the onboard herb garden. \nTo finish it off, it also can employ a personal assistant in the form of an autonomous intelligent robot that can help with more tedious tasks, including helping carry purchases from shopping trips.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rinspeed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe duarte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank m. rinderknecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "oasis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "squba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la vegas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:37.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7634df1c677e5e186620d8c573795af239312754", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQj756osIznPZNZD0CP8JMGzHp_jCcHjQ7SHHsFckCJuZNQcAd9AXjhou8OjjNE47SSE3S5skioJNJ4Z9Tom7Os41XmcM8hSRRbsqluqIRaAgwe9C6cz6D70DkABtqNAxkTvWyF_TM0rQ--", "site_full": "www.pentaxforums.com", "site": "pentaxforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.pentaxforums.com/forums/38-photographic-technique/", "site_categories": ["cameras_and_camcorders", "tech"], "section_title": "Photographic Technique - PentaxForums.com", "title": "Astrophotography hints, anyone?", "title_full": "Astrophotography hints, anyone? - PentaxForums.com", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27937, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "51a4059ff27b8d29b33b5312dce02040ddc5d113", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQj756osIznPZNZD0CP8JMGzHp_jCcHjQ7SHHsFckCJuZNQcAd9AXjhou8OjjNE47SSE3S5skioJNJ4Z9Tom7Os41XmcM8hSRRbsqluqIRaAgwe9C6cz6D70DkABtqNAxkG09e1KFcUXKfZfIgM_fdja2Lav9xNPHc-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Na Horuk", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The simple thing to do is to zoom out, use a really wide aperture, 2 sec timer.

You can use some skymap app to figure out where interesting constellations will be.\nBeyond that, you can do multiple exposures and blend them in specialty programs and so on.\nEdit: I would also recommend to set the camera menu colour to red and bring along a flashlight", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:18:37.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d4bc8dc5f578751a723ce047ec314f8905425ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ApQiAEWQSsNC4xs9vhPGBK8rlQyLrFaVItQRINLER4IL3vryKZZI93gEq.geNYv1sATCCni5JJFNHZn6tRx2MFmXP66qgrTmRgkbtsbW_8A--", "site_full": "www.babycenter.ca", "site": "babycenter.ca", "site_section": "http://www.babycenter.ca/g25018573/december-2017?startIndex=70", "site_categories": ["pregnancy", "family_and_parenting"], "section_title": "December 2017 - Page 8 - BabyCenter Canada", "title": "Toddler sick... hoping baby stays in a bit longer.", "title_full": "Toddler sick... hoping baby stays in a bit longer. - December 2017 - BabyCenter Canada", "published": "2017-12-03T22:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://www.babycenter.ca/webassets/countries/en_CA/logo_200x200.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82588, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6a199535a20206ead1f78728a5d73925e5b665d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ApQiAEWQSsNC4xs9vhPGBK8rlQyLrFaVItQRINLER4IL3vryKZZI93gEq.geNYv1sATCCni5JJFNHZn6tRx2MFmXP66qgrTnT2aAHB6qxPEsuSqtHwjJd8UPWJoDtic4-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Ellah_", "published": "2017-12-03T22:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I hear ya I\u2019m 36+2 weeks and sick \u2639\ufe0f Hoping it will go soon.

On January 24, 2018, NJCTS will celebrate the 10th Anniversary milestone with a special webinar geared towards school nurses titled What a Difference a School Nurse Can Make: A Tourette Syndrome Guide for School Nurses. \n\u201cSchool Nurses play an essential and invaluable role in the lives of children with Tourette Syndrome and their families,\u201d said Faith Rice, executive director of NJCTS. \u201cServing as onsite medical practitioners and mediators between school personnel and families, school nurses are in a unique position to make a lasting positive impact on their students.\u201d \nTourette Syndrome is an inherited, neurological disorder characterized by repeated involuntary movements and uncontrollable vocal sounds called tics. Tourette is much more common than most people think\u2014generally appearing in children at age 6 or 7 in all ethnic groups and affecting both males and females. It is estimated that as many as 1 in 100 people show a partial expression of this disorder, equating to nearly 100,000 in New Jersey alone. \nThe free webinar for school nurses will take place at 7:30 ET and feature Dr. Graham Hartke, a licensed psychologist in private practice and a certified school psychologist. Dr. Hartke will provide an overview of Tourette Syndrome and associated disorders along with specific tips and strategies for school nurses, families, and educators to best help students living with Tourette Syndrome and other associated disorders including Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). \nNJCTS\u2019 Wednesday Webinar series was launched in 2008 and today draws an audience from across the United States and more than 15 countries. The series has featured online seminars for parents, educators and professionals on topics of interest to the TS and associated disorders community, such as anxiety, OCD, sensory issues, bullying, school accommodations, and much more. The 100th webinar, which takes place on February 21, goes back to basics with the topic Understanding Tourette Syndrome. \nTo learn more about the webinar series, to view upcoming webinars, or browse an archive of past webinars, visit njcts.org/webinars.
