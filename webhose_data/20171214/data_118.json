Between 60 and 80 new styles are released each month, which provides shoppers with fresh looks and new limited edition pieces each time they visit a Lorna Jane store, Jobbagy says. \n\u201cIt is very different from everybody else in the market,\u201d she says. \nLorna Jane\u2019s first permanent location in Canada opened during the summer at Shops at Don Mills. With a renovation of the shopping centre having been recently completed, and several new condominium developments underway surrounding the complex, Jobbagy says the mall was an attractive location for Lorna Jane. \n(Lorna Jane Opening at Yorkdale Shopping Centre - Lorna Jane Toronto Instagram) \n\u201cIt seemed to be a good entry level location for us to test the brand,\u201d she says. \nThe store is approximately 1,400 square feet in size, and boasts simple design features. \u201cIt\u2019s a very modern, minimalistic store,\u201d Jobbagy says. \u201cThe products stand out in that minimalistic environment.\u201d \nThe popup store at Yorkdale, which opened on Dec. 1st, provides an opportunity for the brand to gain more exposure among Toronto-area shoppers during the busy holiday season. The 1,300-square-foot store is located next to Club Monaco Men and across from Coach . \n\u201cWe think thousands of people will be exposed to Lorna Jane who have never heard about this brand,\u201d says Jobbagy. \n(Inside the CF Shops at Don Mills store) \nIn addition, the popup will help Lorna Jane to test its success within a major shopping centre in Canada. \n\u201cWe think that will give us an opportunity to make a decision about which direction we go, in terms of expansion,\u201d Jobbagy says. If the popup is successful, she says the brand is likely to explore other permanent locations within shopping malls in Ontario. If sales fail to meet expectations, however, the brand will likely concentrate its growth plans on boutiques within open-air shopping plazas. \n\u201cWe do have plans to expand,\u201d Jobbagy says, \u201cbut we\u2019re at the stage when we want to evaluate how the brand is performing. That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing the popup in Yorkdale.\u201d \nLorna Jane merchandise is also available for purchase online, through Luxeactivewear.ca. \nMegan Harman is a business reporter based in Toronto.

The renovated 1,605 square foot retail space at Toronto\u2019s Yorkdale Shopping Centre is unlike any for the brand, with some components to be introduced to other L\u2019Occitane store locations globally. \nL\u2019Occitane is taking great pride in the beautiful new space, which occupies a bright, corner location in a busy part of Yorkdale that is only steps away from the mall\u2019s Tesla Motors , and Apple Store locations. With a soaring 22-foot high facade, the updated L\u2019Occitane flagship is already catching the attention of passers-by. \n\u201cVisiting this store will be an experience like no other. Upon entering, guests will feel a sense of wonderment \u2013 they will be transported to the lavender fields of Provence, learn about L\u2019Occitane\u2019s expertise in the art of extraction, and visit the land of Corsica, home of the powerful Immortelle flower,\u201d said Paul Blackburn, North American Vice President of Concept Design, Construction & Merchandising. \n(Click for interactive Google Map) \n(The beautiful new space features flowers hanging from the ceilings, and yellow arches referencing the architecture of Provence in France) \n\u201cBehind the striking external glass fa\u00e7ade, a curved video wall immediately attracts the attention of passersby. Below this eye-catching feature is an immersive digital experience inside a pair of suspended capsules. Within each capsule, a true story unfolds before your eyes combining imagery, scent, light and sound for a truly sensorial experience,\u201d he said. \nThe six-foot high by 18-foot wide curved video wall he mentioned was installed this week, and is one of the unique features at the Yorkdale store. Visible from outside the store is a dramatic floor-to-ceiling column displaying hundreds of tubes of hand cream, surrounded with communal seating. L\u2019Occitane commissioned renowned New York City-based brand creative and experience agency School House to design the new store \u2014 School House has been involved in creating several L\u2019Occitane boutique locations. \n\u201cJourneying through Provence is a visceral experience that changes something within you. In 1976, Oliver Baussan experienced a connection to Provence\u2019s land and culture, which he distilled from lavender and rosemary into essential oils. In the same way, we approached Yorkdale as an artistic expression of Provence, served through tactile and digital brand experiences that spark a sense of wonderment,\u201d says Christopher Skinner, founder and principal of School House.\u201d \n(Inside the new store, which includes the 'sun' in the centre, several sinks for customers including the one seen the foreground, as well as the Column to the right which contains hundreds of tubes of skin cream) \n(Rendering showing the facade video screen, not visible in our top photo) \n(Gift Wrapping Area, and men's items) \nThe store\u2019s architecture is inspired by the Provence region of France, with a contemporary twist. Arched ceilings reference the historic region with yellow glass archways, creating a series of \u2018rooms\u2019 that is really just one open retail space. Inside, the Provence references continue with suspended \u201csensorial capsule pods\u201d with visuals that can be modified with hand movements. The unique design is unlike any other in the brand\u2019s portfolio and will set a new standard for L\u2019Occitane\u2019s in-store experience in North America. \nThe inspiration for the store\u2019s interior are the elements of earth, fire, air and water. These are represented as follows: \n-\u2018 Earth \u2019 is represented with a flooring of natural stone and a botanical ceiling installation of a \u2018land reversed,\u2019 -\u2018 Water \u2019 is referenced with automated rain shower sinks, encouraging test-and-play with products beneath showers from hanging illuminated arched domes,-\u2018 Fire \u2019 is channeled through a radiating sun installation set within the ceiling plane above, and-\u2018 Air \u2019 is cultivated into fragrance clouds, creating a unique testing experience for fragrances. \nThe interactive nature of the retail space includes a \u2018skincare bistro\u2019 \u2014 customers are encouraged to try different products and experiment. Last week, the store was busy with customers trying \u2014 and buying. \n(Looking inside of one of the pods -- the image can be modified with the swipe of a hand. Much of the store is experiential, and encourages exploration) \n(Table, towels and products to try) \n(L'Occitane partnered with Stericycle -- customers can bring in empty bottles to receive a discount on new purchases) \nL\u2019Occitane and School House considered the environment when it built the new store \u2014 lighting is 100% LED and for the first time in North America, the store offers an in-store bottle recycling program in partnership with TerraCycle . \nAs well, the store\u2019s stone flooring and countertops are made of recycled natural stone aggregates and contain pre-consumer recycled content. The yellow arches described above are made from specially-formulated co-polyester resin, incorporating 40% pre-consumer recycled content, compatible with one of the largest post-consumer recycle streams, according to L\u2019Occitane. \nThe Yorkdale flagship is the first of several similar experiential stores for the brand. This month, L\u2019Occitaine will unveil two more of these flagships \u2014 one at 86 Champs Elys\u00e9es in Paris, as well as a 6,450 square foot flagship on London\u2019s Regent Street (largest L'Occitane in the world). The Paris store partnered with French pastry chef Pierre Herm\u00e9 , merging beauty with food. \nL\u2019Occitane en Provence was founded in France\u2019s Provence region in 1976 by Olivier Baussan, and it now boasts stores around the world, with over 40 locations in Canada. \nSee below for more photos.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "craig patterson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher skinner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l\u2019occitaine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yorkdale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oliver baussan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul blackburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pierre herm\u00e9", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olivier baussan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "l\u2019occitane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "provence unveils first-of-its-kind digital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple store", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "school house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l'occitane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tesla motors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stericycle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "champs elys\u00e9es", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "provence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yorkdale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yorkdale shopping centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corsica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:36.042+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e0309764565eea54957f07949fecd7281c53f322", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pF3cLPtz3dd6DZxfXXEv9TC73wh0eH1LP", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/jp/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/jp/ - Otaku Culture - 4chan", "title": "H!P Thread #468", "title_full": "/jp/ - H!P Thread #468 - Otaku Culture - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-06T22:48:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 60, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8296e55314e9ad1b49985674192bc5c23dfe00ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pF3cLPtz3dd6DZxfXXEv9TFHHgDBx7fte64fpz32dZo0-", "ord_in_thread": 56, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T10:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Painful sex", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:17:36.051+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7aeafa0a3b2ab303962ee546dab88df571108c50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMlyMzfetSBs.UpxwdfQXqGZZ_FqR2a5zXsm2nSc2Dqhr9458jGs5.ByKXfXs79JQnxwmqTQbFzoOu4c5NC6GT6Eo-", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[Rainbow Six-Siege] Always Check Your Corners! 14", "title_full": "[Rainbow Six-Siege] Always Check Your Corners! - Page 14 \u2014 Penny Arcade", "published": "2017-09-09T11:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/R7QdPVEBBt8/0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8253, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2bea7ce3e019e3b64717fb4b3f67f3903f4987c1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMlyMzfetSBs.UpxwdfQXqGZZ_FqR2a5zXsm2nSc2Dqhr9458jGs5.ByKXfXs79JQnxwmqTQbFzoOumbDheqZxkkdj97Y.fokfYQ--", "ord_in_thread": 14, "author": "Professor Phobos", "published": "2017-12-07T01:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It's pretty good!

It\u2019s not hard to see that email remains one of the most effective ways to reach customers. For savvy marketers, meeting consumers at this vital touchpoint is an opportunity that can\u2019t be ignored. \nBut when it comes to consistently growing subscriber databases and maintaining subscriber engagement, the struggle \u2013 as they say \u2013 is real. Marketers often make the mistake of focusing on acquiring the sign-up, and then reverting to a generic batch-and\u2013blast messaging strategy. But this causes your subscribers to disengage earlier. They expect you to send them relevant, personalized experiences. And if you don\u2019t deliver, you can wave goodbye to those subscribers you worked so hard to acquire. \nSo, how do you grow your list size in a way that will help you collect the right customers and keep them engaged? \nBe Consistent \u2013 and Creative \nWhen looking to steadily grow your contact database, you need to take a consistent, multi-pronged approach. There are a few ways you can do this. First, include a sign-up above the fold of your homepage, or even better, on all pages of your site. This gives consumers an easy way to sign up while browsing on your site. This is especially important if they link directly to a product page from the web. Limiting the signup to only the homepage decreases your ability to secure a new subscriber. \nYou\u2019ll also want to consider popups, dropdowns, and ribbons. These strategies are front and center to new visitors and are routinely the most effective list-growth tactics. Of course, don\u2019t ignore other areas of growth: Include social pages, co-registration partnerships, and brick-and-mortar stores. \nNow to address the elephant in the room: Should you offer an incentive for singing up? The answer is \u2013 it depends. Be wary of training your customers to wait for discounts to make purchases. You can always get creative when it comes to what to offer: A free gift with their next purchase, a weekly or monthly raffle for a gift card or other prize for new signups, or even partner with a cause that is meaningful to your subscribers \u2013 which is another great way to personalize. \nFor example, if your brand sells men\u2019s underwear, consider supporting a testicular cancer foundation. Promote and communicate this cause on your website, and ask them to sign-up to receive more information on how they can help get involved. You can even provide a \u201ccoupon code\u201d to use at checkout that will allow that discount to be donated, rather than taken off the purchase price. This way the consumer becomes emotionally connected, and the brand can track the effectiveness of the campaign. \nGet Personal \nYou\u2019ve acquired new subscribers. Now it\u2019s time to personalize their experience. Regardless of the products you sell \u2013 men\u2019s underwear, cookies or car parts \u2013 personalization (even on a small scale) can have a deep and lasting effect. It can be the difference between keeping subscribers engaged \u2013 or having them hit \u201cunsubscribe.\u201d \nThe good news is that difference is entirely up to you. Even if you are using a batch-and-blast email strategy, look for areas where you can maximize personalization and create a bond with your customer. This could be acquisition source (on-site), email or purchase behavior. If you know your subscriber signed up to receive emails while viewing men\u2019s shoes, your welcome message or series should have a high focus on men\u2019s shoes. Include intuitive product recommendations in your batch-and-blast messages \u2013 making them immediately more relevant. If users click on a maternity link inside of your emails, they should be sent emails focused on maternity items. If they are a recent purchaser, helpful tips on how to care for a newly purchased product is a great way to build trust and provide value to a customer. \nThe best part of all of this is that this can all be automated, taking a large burden off your team. \nMake Them Believers \nCommerce marketing isn\u2019t about acquisition versus retention \u2013 it\u2019s a combined strategy. You want to acquire the right customer and then engage them effectively along the way by showing that your brand understands them. \nFocusing on your overall strategy will help get the right message, to the right customer, at the right time. This is where using segmentation, automation, send frequency and personalization can help. \nRemember: One-size-fits-all might work for concert t-shirts, but it rarely \u2013 if ever \u2013 works for email. \nOracle + Bronto arms high-growth retailers with sophisticated marketing automation to maximize revenue opportunities.

Snowpiercer", "text": "Want me to watch a movie? \nSend me a direct message on Twitter and I\u2019ll get on that! @moviereviewday 251. Snowpiercer by Justin Sedgwick \n\u2605\u2605\u2605 \nPeople are usually fully-entrenchedthe first time they watch \u201cSnowpiercer.\u201d They get told by their friends to watch the film without knowing exactly what its about. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the plot, just go in and enjoy it,\u201d these friends say. And then they induct a new group of \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d fans into their midst, ones who will eventually replace the older disenfranchised \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d fans, starting the process all over again. Wash, rinse, Chris Evans, repeat. \nI am like one of these friends who baited people to watch \u201cSnowpiercer.\u201d When I first saw it in 2014, it really was a transformative movie-going experience despite not knowing anything about it before stepping into the theater. Watching it for maybe the third or fourth time now in 2017, it still holds up its gory, \u201cOccupy Wall Street\u201d-esque charm, but its political leanings and twist are much less impactful. The entire notion of a rich vs. poor society existing on a train seems wildly inventive and incredibly stupid. And the story feels like a movie simultaneously written by and exclusively marketed for a group of freshman college students who just read the entirety of the Wikipedia page on Communism when they felt compelled to write a screenplay. \nBut regardless of whether you think its smart or silly, one can\u2019t deny that \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d is good fun. The movie follows Curtis (played by Chris Evans), a beard-wearing, blue collar type who lives among other working class folk in the back section of an eternally-moving train that carries all the survivors of a global ice age. One of his friends is Gillam, an older, idealistic figure played by John Hurt. The two plan a revolution to get to the front of the train and reclaim a sense of fairness and equality for their poorer brethren. But after slo-mo axe battles and James Bond-esque snowy gunfights, Curtis learns the truth that everything on the train, from the class distinctions to the revolt itself, is carefully planned and maintained, as predictable and acceptable as a simple-minded goldfish eating its flaky food. He has a crisis of conscious while his buddy Namgoong Minsoo (played by Kang-ho Song) tries to blow up the train. And then Minsoo\u2019s daughter and the son of Octavia Spencer\u2019s character Tanya survive and try to fend for themselves in the snowy apocalyptic aftermath. \nOf course, all of this is thrilling on first viewing. It\u2019s seemingly unpredictable, and feels like a wholly realized cinematic universe built scrap metal and polished steel is unfolding for the first time in front of our very eyes. But second time around that steel becomes rusted, a storytelling opportunity thwarted from reaching its full potential. It seems the natural way for writer and director Joon-ho Bong to have gone is asking his characters \u201cif there were a chance you could live on the outside of the train, would you have the desire or even the courage to take it?\u201d But the whole wealthy vs. poor thing we get instead seems really silly, an out-of-date attempt to appeal to anyone who\u2019s ever protested anything pre-Trump era, or has ever been annoyed by a douchebag in a BMW. \nIt\u2019s hard to admit since it is so much fun, but \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d is outdated, a byproduct of a time where rich vs. poor was the main battle the country was facing, rather than our current Trump supporters vs. everyone else. Watching \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d in 2017 feels like watching a movie about the Iraq war in 2013, or a film about 9/11 in 2008 or 2009. There\u2019s only a small amount of time where you can make a political statement in a movie and have that political statement still feel relevant. I don\u2019t know enough about Joon-ho Bong to say if he\u2019s a \u201cpolitical\u201d filmmaker, but his recent flick \u201cOkja\u201d shows he has a keen ability to craft a story that echoes a certain political or social argument. But \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d proves that while he may be a passionate cinematic speech maker, his message melts like snow as the years go on.

Open days/Vac Schemes/TCs\n Quote: : Don't use the same example for two different questions. But that's easy to say with an application form - you can pick whichever question most seems to suit that answer. It might be harder in an interview if you get asked a question later after you've already used your best example.\nBut do come up with a different example for the second question. I think the advice from the law firm about \"sporting achievements and other extracurricular activities\" is a bit lazy. That might be what most grads have to offer, but in your case you also have plenty of work experience to pick examples from, so to answer a question like this you could give a powerful example of a project that you managed through challenges and to a successful conclusion. That could be used as an example of either overcoming challenge, or an accomplishment, depending on how you frame it. So do use wheelchair tennis if you feel that is your best example, but don't feel confined to use sport or extracurriculars. Use your work experience if that would allow you to answer the question better.\nIn an interview situation if they ask a question that you might have answered with your preferred answer (except that you have already used it earlier), then you could start with, \"Well my answer about X would have been a perfect example of course, but to give you another one ...\"\nA good preparation for any interview would be to have 5 to 10 achievements in mind of a variety of types.

There I coauthored a paper with US counterparts and then was the sole UK representative at a defence economics conference in the US presenting the paper as well as other topics over the week. I can talk about the processes involved, relationship building etc. Which then culminated in me being trusted to represent the UK to more senior US/NZ/AUS counterparts.\nThere are some other examples I could also draw on, having my work on ISIL Quote: d in the FT, having my first impact assessment (the product of 6 months work) published.\nIn this case they haven\u2019t asked about overcoming a challenge, so I was wondering if I could talk about recovering from an accident as an accomplishment?

I then have OSPF running between the two on their sw0 interfaces and OSPF seems to be working fine (Adjacency forms, routes exchanges, ect.)\nNow, on the EP-6 I have a VLAN on sw0 (sw0.15) setup for a private subnet and hosts on that subnet cannot ping any interfaces on the ERPoe-5 (Including the interface used for OSPF). If I move that subnet and hosts off sw0.15 and onto just sw0, everything works fine.\nThe interesting thing is that if I SSH into the EP-6 and ping an interface on the ERPoe-5 from the sw0.15 interface (Using \"Sudo ping -I ...) it WORKS!\nI only have what I have described configured. No firewall rules, no anything else. Just the interface IP's, OSPF, and DHCP on the subnet for sw0.15.\nAm I overlooking something here?

11% growth in Q4 FY18 with 40 lakh wheel confirmed order book as compared to 36.01 lakh wheel order in same quarter previous year.

This will help it in making larger foot print in export markets. This will help it in achieving the highest ever truck segment sales for Q4 FY18.\n\nMoreover, the rising car exports and growing domestic demand are the factor for reaching 90% capacity utilization and highest sales volume of its Chennai car wheel plant. The company is expecting the recent order wins from domestic as well as export markets will ensure extremely healthy plant utilization.\n\nSSWL is a part of the Steel Strips Group, headquartered in Chandigarh.

Is it filled with hope or hopelessness? Is your mind focused on the steps necessary to make changes to capture your dreams, or are you stuck staring down the same long endless tunnel of today? \nThere are many reasons why we hide from living our best life. But the No. 1 reason is fear. \nWe settle for a mediocre life because we are afraid of the unknown. We are satisfied with the mediocre because at least we have a paying job. \nI know. I was there \u2013 $400,000 in debt, always with more work than money. I had to let go of the fear of failure. Honestly, I was already failing, and there wasn\u2019t much left to lose. I had to decide what I wanted my best life to look like and go after it. Are you there yet? Are you ready today to stop settling and start pursuing your dreams? \nNothing\u2019s changed. \nYou\u2019ve consistently worked harder and harder, but more and more work piles up, along with more and more bills. There\u2019s a difference between forming good habits and going through the motions. Success is created from small daily tasks that lead to achieved goals. But those tasks must be intentional. \nDoing the same old things has led you to where you are today. It\u2019s time to work smarter, not harder. Your tomorrow holds great potential, but you have to work for it. Success won\u2019t be handed to you. \nAsk yourself: \u201cWhat have I done today to move toward success?\u201d If your answer is \u201cnothing,\u201d that\u2019s exactly why your tomorrow will look exactly like your today. But you can change your tomorrow by joining us. You won\u2019t find a better business opportunity to succeed anywhere else outside of these 16 Steps to 6 Figures. \nWhen I was at my lowest, I was willing to do absolutely anything to get out of debt, out of a miserable, purposeless life that was bringing me and my soon-to-be ex-wife down with me.

Streep on Thursday also called the allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein \"the most gargantuan example of disrespect\" permeating every industry. She said women still don't have enough representation in leadership positions and that impacts how decisions are made. Streep said women in the entertainment industry are prepared to demand for equal representation in board rooms and other improvements to the American workplace. \"We are after 50/50 by 2020,\" she said to loud applause. \"Equal means equal. And if it starts at the top, none of these shenanigans would have filtered down and it wouldn't have been tolerated.\" Streep made the comments in a conversation with feminist icon Gloria Steinem at the Massachusetts Women's Conference in Boston. \"It's such an interesting moment, because this conversation about why this is so widespread, this is really worth having and it's fantastic,\" she said. \"I can't help thinking it's just a door that's opening to a better world.\" The 13th annual conference, which organizers say was attended by a record 16,000 people, also featured speeches from Academy Award-winning actor Viola Davis and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. At the two-day conference's opening night Wednesday, Steinem took a shot at President Donald Trump, calling the billionaire the \"harasser in chief.\" More than a dozen women have said Trump sexually assaulted or harassed them over the years. He has denied the allegations.
