Out on the oval, however, outside the Calvary Christian Church building, a food festival and kids' carnival will swing into action. \nPopular local vendors at the food festival include Mr Chippy, Mr Whippy, Chinese, Thai, Cake Mania, Decadent Delights and Go Raw. \nThe kids' carnival will then feature jumping castles, mega slides and face painting. \nCalvary Christian Church pastor Chris Yelland said this was the second year the Carols Spectacular had been held. \nHe had been looking forward to it since the moment the last one finished. \n\"It was so enjoyable last year, the whole team has been looking forward to it all year long,\u201d he said. \n\"We had hundreds of people turn up to the Carols Spectacular last year and it was well received. \n\"It is going to be a fun night, so come out with your families, sing all of your favourite songs and then have a great meal afterwards. \n\"The kids' carnival is there to keep the kids entertained while mum and dad can mingle and have some dinner.\u201d \nPastor Yelland believes the church should have the loudest voice during this time of the year. \n\"Jesus is the centre of it all and the reason we have the holiday, so we thought, why not put on a display for the community and bless them with a great event that will share that message,\u201d he said. \nHe believes the Carols Spectacular is something that is going to continue to grow in years to come. \n\"We presume this will be the last year we will be able to hold the event inside our building, as we had 100 people turn up last year and are expecting it to grow this year, so it is onwards and upwards,\u201d he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yelland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chippy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris yelland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mr whippy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "calvary emeral", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calvary christian church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gladstone st.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calvary christian church emerald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aden stokes  calvary christian church emerald", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "santa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:02.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8f8b750dc599cff06355bd0bd045bcc27cc2a086", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p10yln1njePX.defxGVdSAIomzB6fuIfL", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/m/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/m/ - Mecha - 4chan", "title": "Gundam Plastic Model General", "title_full": "/m/ - Gundam Plastic Model General - Mecha - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T07:14:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 51, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e2005bc6c36527b13b5baba9e4a22f5e4e304eef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p10yln1njePX.defxGVdSAHMb5rztyTNDZG.9GLqylaQ-", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T08:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>16079681\nYou're right.

Contributed Use this content by Aden Stokes \nWITH only three weeks until Christmas, the Salvation Army is hoping to provide a small miracle for more than 40 Central Highlands families. \nCaptain Lenore Whittaker said Christmas was a tough time of the year on the family budget, with extra bills for preparing for school costs, special festive meals and holiday activities for children added to the everyday cost of living. \n\"We've been interviewing people that need help this Christmas but there is room for more,\u201d Capt Whittaker said. \n\"We have had a number of people coming through our doors, families with children and single mums. \n\"They receive a gift card for food. If they are a single mum, they receive a personal gift card and also receive toys for each one their children. \n\"In the back room we have prepared hundreds of toys and put them on display.

That, or a tobacco shop that appears to be doing business as well as the local courthouse, where that state has celebrated dropping from No. 1 to No. 4 with the highest rate of divorce. Either way, shotgun marriages there must have blanks in the guns because they\u2019re not very binding long term. The lawyers may love it, but if the Justices of the Peace were football coaches, they would long be fired with such records of success. \nHalf of Arkansas still supports the Clintons, while the other half has a personal story or two of Bill\u2019s antics as governor. Almost all of them loathe Hillary. Most of them truly thought Gus Malzahn would leave Auburn for the Razorbacks, and when he stayed on The Plains (there are no plains, by the way, at Auburn) they say they\u2019re better off without him. Hmmm. OK, and an SMU coach is now your pick to lead the Hogs out of the slop Bret Bielema put them in? Good luck with that. \nThings in Texas, such as the ego of Longhorn fans, are just bigger. The countdown has begun on how long it will take new Texas A&M coach Jimbo Fisher to say something that will irk those in Austin, who still believe they are the most powerful in all of earth, although they have had nothing to show for it since Vince Young scrambled for a TD to win the 2005 BCS title. Let\u2019s see, Lance Armstrong lied, repeatedly, about doping to win the Tour de\u2019 France, and the state has gone from the movie giant Giant to a film \u2013 Waco -- about one of the biggest nuts in my lifetime, David Koresh. Texas can also claim some of the worst characters ever to coach at Baylor with basketball\u2019s Dave Bliss and football\u2019s Art Briles. \nGeorgia used to get my sympathy because Mark Richt would take Bulldog fans to the candy store but only let them look in the window before sadly walking away. Kirby Smart, meanwhile, has busted his team inside the store and eating Almond Joys with the other big boys of college football. I still believe Jimmy Carter was out of his league as a president, but I also still believe he\u2019s a genuinely nice guy. Reckon what they\u2019ll say about Donald Trump in 50 years? \nMissouri has its share of political misfits, not unlike many other states, but at least the Show Me State has limited expectations in athletics outside of its Major League Baseball teams. Every state has its different cultures, but I\u2019m telling you, spend some time in St. Louis, then spend some time in Southern Missouri. It\u2019s like the difference between the area around the Boll Weevil Monument and Tiananmen Square. \nTennessee once had the greatest venue to watch a college football game, I thought. But the powers that be have soured Volunteer fans with more wrong moves than Butch Jones\u2019 in a press conference. And the school has brought back Phil Fulmer as its athletic director. Good luck with that! \nI found my way back to Alabama, where football rules the roost and politics are the halftime entertainment. \nThere are more questions for Senate candidate Roy Moore from 40 years ago than those surrounding Luke Skywalker and Darth Vadar, but then again, few are complaining about a coach getting about $7 million a year coaching about 12 games, so nothing surprises me anymore.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bret bielema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke skywalker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clintons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vince young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark richt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darth vadar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimbo fisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave bliss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david koresh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy carter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lance armstrong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gus malzahn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "butch jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phil fulmer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "texas a&m", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "show me state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirby smart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "razorbacks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "major league baseball", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boll weevil monument", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oklahoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tiananmen square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. louis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:04.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3f5aa0556bb8f5fa5e870bece68c6b38df529dc0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT3.LaHO6F1Y3RziHj_cvlDGP3903Tk4_eUDKt8wpMnu.t8Op0NGmGW472yoOI4dEhKlcdH3yLAtIF8ePDuck92YCeJHFuj_Tz_fYn22TrUCiXwIdlpuxzaFoOiRv2SvsAq5kWkl1W9qA--", "site_full": "www.thaivisa.com", "site": "thaivisa.com", "site_section": "https://www.thaivisa.com/forum/forum/59-real-estate-housing-house-and-land-ownership/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Real Estate, housing, house and land ownership - Thailand Visa Forum by Thai Visa | The Nation", "title": "Give house to Thai girlfriend via estate of deceased farang", "title_full": "Give house to Thai girlfriend via estate of deceased farang - Real Estate, housing, house and land ownership - Thailand Visa Forum by Thai Visa | The Nation", "published": "2017-12-05T06:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.249, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11618, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "75332ec4446ff8314154ec2297fcafc0741d6cea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT3.LaHO6F1Y3RziHj_cvlDGP3903Tk4_eUDKt8wpMnu.t8Op0NGmGW472yoOI4dEhKlcdH3yLAtIF8ePDuck92YCeJHFuj_Tz_fYn22TrUCiXwIdlpuxzaFoOiRv2SvsBrHi_cCm6NpkwT9JgGuC1G", "ord_in_thread": 13, "author": "scorecard", "published": "2017-12-06T22:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "20 hours ago, henry15 said: Not correct.

He must also explaine what he is planning to do with the estate.\nI've been an aproved executor of an estate. The deceased was an Thai national. Inheretance laws and procedures are rather complicated in Thailand. So i advice to contact a lawyer.\nWould like to give a warning. An executor take over all the legal rights of the deceased.

He can do anything on his day. \n\u201cThe boy just needs confidence from week in, week out and that only comes from playing. \n\u201cThe manager\u2019s given him a chance and he will make mistakes. The players and fans need to keep encouraging him. \n\u201cIf he keeps wanting it, he can go all the way to the top. \n\u201cWhat he can do with the ball - although he\u2019s not at that sort of level yet - the top players in the Premier League and above can do it. \n\u201cIn training he shows some outstanding ability. \n\u201cHe\u2019s a lovely lad, a quiet lad, who will mature and learn to get more confident about match play. \n\u201cThe Scunthorpe game was a great game for him because they\u2019re a physical team that will kick him all over but he\u2019s strong when he wants to be. \n\u201cI\u2019m excited for his development.\u201d \nHe added: \u201cWhen he first came in you could tell he didn\u2019t have that confidence that league players get. \n\u201cYou keep working on him and if it clicks I think you\u2019ve got one hell of a player. I think he could be incredible. \n\u201cBut it\u2019s a process and it\u2019s not going to happen overnight. \n\u201cHe\u2019ll keep working hard.

The price is up in the air. And Disney \u2014 a company that owns everything from Star Wars to Marvel to ESPN \u2014 hasn\u2019t clearly signaled how it will divvy its major franchises and brands across two or more services.\nBut much of the prognosticating \u2014 especially those betting on a battle between Disney and Netflix \u2014 reveals a misunderstanding of the marketplace.\nDon\u2019t assume internet-distributed video will be dominated by a single service, or that all video services compete against each other. Instead, Disney\u2019s new streaming service points to the growing range of offerings consumers will be able to choose from in the coming months and years.\nThere\u2019s room for multiple winners \nDisney, for example, recently suggested one of its new services would include only family-friendly content and would be priced \u201c substantially lower \u201d than Netflix.\nBut is that service a threat to Netflix, as some have suggested ? Of course not.\nIt helps to think of new television streaming services as specialty stores like the Gap, Chico\u2019s or Justice. All sell clothing, but they compete minimally with one another because each targets consumers of different ages.\nLikewise, while a department store such as Macy\u2019s might compete a bit with each of these stores, they\u2019re primarily concerned with other retailers that house many goods under the same roof \u2014 Target, Walmart and J.C. Penney. Even in a world of online retailers, there\u2019s a huge variety among specialty sellers and Amazon\u2019s one-stop shopping.\nWhen it comes to streaming services, they might all deliver the same thing \u2014 video \u2014 via an internet connection. But it\u2019s important to understand that all video services are not in competition. Many are quite complementary. Most offer completely different libraries of content and instead compete with cable and satellite packages. A Disney service would replicate only a small part of Netflix\u2019s library, and would likely include much of the content offered on the Disney Channel.\nConsumers with young children may decide that they need only a service with content for kids. Or they may decide they want a single library with content for both adults and children. Or they may decide that each provides enough value to subscribe to both.\nInternet-distributed television simply offers much more flexibility; it\u2019s up to consumers to assess what they want and how much they want to spread their spending.\nIn addition to differences based on the type of content these services offer, their revenue models are also distinct. Contrast YouTube and Netflix. YouTube \u2014 like other social media platforms \u2014 has low content costs because users create and upload most videos. Without substantial program costs, YouTube can develop a business supported through advertising.\nIn contrast, Netflix offers a deliberately curated library of content that it either pays to license or creates. It provides a library valued enough by some to pay a monthly fee for access to it. Because of the difference in their revenue models and the content those models allow, Netflix and YouTube are far more complementary than competitive.\nThe breakdown of channel bundles \nFor decades, U.S. television viewers could choose from only two or three options: broadcast signals, an expensive cable or satellite bundle, or a bigger, even more expensive cable or satellite bundle.\nPeople frustrated with bundles (\u201cWhy would I want all of these channels?\u201d) used to call for \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d cable: the ability to select individual cable channels for which they hoped to pay less than the high amount for a bundle with many channels they never viewed.\nOf course, there was a reason companies didn\u2019t let customers pay less for fewer channels \u2014 the bundles are the result of a business strategy intended to maximize profits.\nBut even though traditional cable remains bundled, more and more entertainment companies \u2014 like Disney \u2014 are offering their content at a standalone fee, allowing consumers to cobble together a customized menu of services. When viewers decide whether to subscribe to Disney\u2019s new service, they\u2019ll think about how this added cost relates to what they\u2019re already paying, and whether it\u2019s worth it.\nWe\u2019re still in the early days of this new way of delivering television and film. For every headline announcing a service shutting down , new ones are launching. And FCC plans to eliminate net neutrality will likely change this landscape tremendously.\nIt\u2019s all part of the process of companies figuring out how much consumers want and how much they\u2019re willing to pay. The new services offering content geared to a brand, franchise or genre \u2014 Disney, WWE Network (wrestling), Shudder (horror) \u2014 never plan on being in every home in the way CBS and NBC once were.\nJust as we sometimes choose the one-stop shopping of Target, services such as Netflix offer convenience.

Whether or not Nvidia dominates that market is TBD.\nIntel has announced plans with AMD to create discrete GPUs that can compete better with Nvidia GPUs in laptop format.\nPerhaps that will be successful. Laptops need better graphics for gaming. However, as you can see, Nvidia is dominating both companies, and 1+1 is not always > 1 in this context. Further, laptop gaming with a discrete GPU is not the high end of gaming. High end gamers understand that they will not be using 2 lb MacBooks that run at room temperature without a fan.\nCAP, CAP, CAP, CAP. Competitive Advantage Period. This represents not only how long the company will be able to return superior economic returns due to superior competitive advantage, but also how great their advantage is compared to rivals and alternatives.\nWhat is almost always overlooked by markets (almost always) but history has shown, is that the best returns vs. risk occur when the company you invest in has little to no real competition.\nBecause of software that creates islands, Apple has no real competition. most Apple users would not even look at a none Apple OS device. Same with Windows computers, etc. IT was only disruptive innovation and market saturation that made Microsoft normal, but only after decades.\nWill a SHOP merchant switch? I think that larger SHOP merchants may switch fi they had a reason, but the run of the mill merchant, who learns how to build with SHOP and creates their SHOP will have no thought of switching at all.\nWith Nvidia their primary competition is...AMD. AMD is the modern day embodiment of the Buffalo Bills of competitors. Occasionally they make some noise and give hope, but mostly they offer not much in regard to ultimate resistance.\nAMD is even weaker in the data center where Nvidia has nearly the same competitive position that Intel has with CPUs in the data center, except the market for GPUs is growing much faster and has a much larger runway to grow into.\nAutonomous driving the competitive landscape is not yet clear. What Google has vs. what Nvidia can bring vs. what Intel might offer is TBD. So we shall see.\nBut a practical world wide monopoly in two enormous markets, with potential for a third, and with the data center and AI market being subdivided into multiple markets that each need to be specifically served through different hardware, chips and infrastructure...\nAnyways, if you were worried about Nvidia...markets do what they do. Fundamentals assert themselves. Nvidia's CAP is enormous and growing as GPU speeds and demands grow.\nThere appears to be similar issues with Arista due to its software but that is another post.\nNutanix may claim yet another similar CAP (tbd, depending on its pricing power). Certainly their primary competitor VMWare has just such a CAP with demonstrated pricing power.\nTinker", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-running-away-gpu-market-031200215.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:06.057+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ed04bcd5a651566b7c58a3890830ed96f1800c26", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPtjoebeD9uDXB98IhWwPjIZmrk0Q6D0sE0vZTf8vtLmm3E8fSWlBmSPFsNhm_cvcUazgNHvsEZlaLLMT_ByVbq0ZEuq0463x31JF_LsisjcXr0bjDXapF0KFp3Q6gP4xLL4Vhc_Hba7tw_C2ZiZ_YRJxakLG0WUs-", "site_full": "www.northamericanmotoring.com", "site": "northamericanmotoring.com", "site_section": "https://www.northamericanmotoring.com/forums/wheels-tires-brakes-443/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Wheels/Tires/Brakes - North American Motoring", "title": "Curbed my black wheels!

In the film it is the house of a triad boss whose daughter knew Scott's son. The scene starts with a view from Repulse Bay Road looking back towards the Repulse Bay Apartments.\n\n\n The old driveway of Eucliffe seems to coincide with the modern day entrance into the development that replaced it (which goes by the rather bland- for HK at least - name of \"56 Repulse Bay\"). The old entrance can be seen in the next shot. \n\nOnce inside the driveway we can see the front entrance. I have no idea whether or not the place was still being lived in when this film was made, but it looks as though the small centre garden in the middle of the circular driveway was still being tended to (or quickly fixed up by the film crew?). The building still had a few years of life left before demolition, so it's feasible it was still being lived in at this time. \n\nWe even get a quick glimpse inside the hallway as the maid opens the door to let them in, and what looks to be a conservatory in the next scene - although , I must admit, I am only guessing that it was filmed inside the building.

Kristen Booth Use this content by Kristen Booth \nA SUSPICIOUS fire destroyed the main store in the town of Bluff on Sunday morning, taking some of the town's precious history with it. \nEmergency services were called to the Bluff Family Store on Main St at 2.47am following reports of a fire. \nOn arrival, the structure was well alight. Fire crews fought the blaze for several hours to prevent it spreading to neighbouring buildings. \nThey extinguished the blaze at about 5am and the extent of the destruction was revealed, with major damage to the interior and exterior of the business. \nCurrent owner of the store, John Parker, said its loss would definitely be felt by the locals. \n\"It's going to hurt a bit convenience-wise; the closest shops here are Blackwater,\u201d he said. \nHe and his wife Adelle bought the shop about five years ago when they moved to Bluff for work. \nMr Parker, who now lives near Rockhampton, originally bought the store to give his wife a job while he worked in the mines. \nThe store was the main stop in the town. \n\"People from Blackwater used to come out here just to buy a burger for lunch,\u201d he said. \n\"The town is very fortunate that the fire was confined to where it was. \n\"I am surprised that the neighbours are still there and the house next door. It's unbelievable.\u201d INFERNO: A fire destroyed a store in Bluff yesterday morning. Police are investigating the suspicious blaze. QPS \nLiz McGrath has lived in Bluff for 34 years, and has been an integral part of the Bluff Family Store. \nMrs McGrath was employed by the store owners for at least 12 years and said, throughout that time, she really saw how the store was the cornerstone of the town. \n\"It was where people met and where you got parcels delivered,\u201d she said. \n\"It was a drop-off point, it was a meeting point, it was where the kids would come after school to get their 20 cents worth of lollies. \n\"That will be sadly missed from all the generations that used to visit it - grandfathers down to their children. \n\"A lot of the newer people in town probably wouldn't have had a lot of the benefit of the shop like the older ones here. \n\"It used to be a video store, it's a restaurant, it sold fuel, groceries - there were some older people here that used to buy all their groceries from the store. \n\"You really didn't need to leave town at all.\u201d \nBecoming as close as family, Mrs McGrath said it barely felt like going to work, but rather going to a social outing with a group of friends. \n\"We had awesome customers in general and the people that used to come in were more like friends than customers. It was almost a social outing going to work,\u201d she said. \n\"The atmosphere there, it was like an old-fashioned family store, it really was, and those of us that ran it were like family. The atmosphere was just awesome.\u201d \nMrs McGrath said the impact of the loss would be huge for the whole community. \n\"It will be more than people realise. \n\"For bread and milk, residents now have to do a 42km round trip to Blackwater,\u201d she said. \n\"Obviously we'll find ways around it, but you'll just have to shop a little differently and, when you run out of Gravox or something like that, there's no racing to the store. \n\"The town will adapt, but there's a lot of history that will never be seen again, it is gone forever now.\u201d \nIn recent years, the store undertook major renovations. \nOwners found old records, photographs and receipts in the roof, which Mrs McGrath said were then displayed in the shop. \n\"There was a lot of memorabilia from the old mining days, and there is nowhere else that has that,\u201d she said. \n\"How fortunate that those surrounding it were saved. It was an incredible fire, and the fact that they saved those surrounding it is a credit to those who were fighting the fire at the time. \n\"This community is amazing. \n\"When push comes to shove, they really come together and help each other out. \n\"I'm very proud of this town. It is a lovely community, and the store really is going to be sorely missed.\u201d \nThe entire town is feeling the loss of the iconic store, including the teachers from Bluff State School who said when they wanted to have a lunch together, they would usually grab it from the store. This week, they had to drive out to Blackwater to get lunch for everybody. \nPolice investigations to date suggest that the fire is suspicious and are urging anyone with information to contact them.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john parker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristen booth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liz mcgrath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gravox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adelle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs mcgrath", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bluff family store", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blackwater", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bluff state school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rockhampton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bluff", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:39:08.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d6c328aede33590da96b9674bb501bdc21f3cc3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8y1Qy6zH5D2NCfpe7n0qQOy5kfMgQ5etlh2F_k77LkxsT973kzLNOcik9wgsnaEU57AG6F2H9rFUZy_SnqdMWD5AH0Vs6x37GC5k3Ye1bD_n1B0iCVAwq7", "site_full": "www.khq.com", "site": "khq.com", "site_section": "http://www.khq.com/category/13530/national-news?clienttype=rss", "site_categories": ["media", "business", "entertainment"], "section_title": "KHQ Right Now - National - Headline", "title": "North Carolina county's ransomware recovery will take days", "title_full": "North Carolina county's ransomware recovery will take days", "published": "2017-12-07T11:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.worldnow.com/AP/images/15576364_G.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 62196, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8d6c328aede33590da96b9674bb501bdc21f3cc3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8y1Qy6zH5D2NCfpe7n0qQOy5kfMgQ5etlh2F_k77LkxsT973kzLNOcik9wgsnaEU57AG6F2H9rFUZy_SnqdMWD5AH0Vs6x37GC5k3Ye1bD_n1B0iCVAwq7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "North Carolina county's ransomware recovery will take days", "text": "North Carolina county's ransomware recovery will take days Posted: Updated: (Diedra Laird/The Charlotte Observer via AP).

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .
