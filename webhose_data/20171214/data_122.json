You apparently don't understand the difference between committing a crime and getting away with it and doing things legally. Well that was needlessly rude. It seems many here think they know what other people are thinking even when they say something else.\nQuote: : When one commits a crime he is betting his freedom, future and fortune on not getting caught. But folks who commit crimes get caught in all sorts of ways -- often ways that were unexpected. The prisons are full of people who didn't expect to get caught. What apparently flew right over your head was that my post was entirely about not assuming people's intentions. I wasn't stating that he should have lied. I wasn't saying he should have \"gotten away with it\". I was saying without providing/creating the evidence like he did he would never have been convicted. There is a difference you know. When people aren't doing illegal things they generally don't create such evidence.\nQuote: : Whether there will be evidence which could convict the actor of the crime he committed depends on exactly what happened and how it happened. But it's difficult to do something without leaving tracks. Intent is an element of many crimes, and prosecutors prove intent to the satisfaction of juries all the time, often with circumstantial evidence. Except that circumstantial evidence has nothing to do with the Abramski case and the Abramski case is the only one that anybody has cited in reference to someone being convicted of a straw purchase between two legal parties. The implication is that a wife buying a gun for her husband needs to \"be careful\" lest they fall into the \"trap\" like Abramski did.\nLook at the title of this thread. Nobody is accidentally going to get convicted of a straw purchase because they bought a gun for their husband unless they are actually doing something intentionally to circumvent the law. Otherwise they are not going to create the evidence of wrongdoing necessary for a conviction as Abramski did. If you think this is something that people really need to be careful to avoid, then you should be able to point to multiple examples showing how it's happened to other people.\nQuote: : One of the things we try to do here is help folks understand what sorts of conduct is criminal and what sorts of conduct is legal. If someone understands that what he is doing is a crime and decides nonetheless to bet his freedom, future, and fortune on not getting caught that will be his problem. What I said was that, based on his (Parker Dreamin's) explanation his conduct was legal. What Chewy65 is saying is that he thinks it's illegal based on his own suspicion that Parker is lying about his intentions.\nQuote: : And since you obviously don't understand Abramski Thanks @%#$, but I understand just fine. I just don't like calling people liars unless I have actual proof they are lying.\nA wife can buy her non-prohibited husband a gun as a gift .... period.\nIf she is lying and he's actually writing her a check to cover the purchase and bragging to his friends about how he got away with it he might get caught, and rightfully so because he's an idiot. If it's a legitimate gift then there's really nothing to worry about.

I haven't dug into it much, but it provides that:\nWhat you are doing smacks of aiding and abetting the dealer to in form if not in substance circumvent state law and IIRC federal law provides that the dealer must abide by it and that exposes you and your wife to aiding and abetting the dealer to violate federal law. Most likely nobody cares, unless for some reason John Law takes an interest in things. If the dealer will hold the gun until you can begin DROS in your name, that is the safe and the smart thing to do. After re-reading the post I'm beginning to get confused. It appears he's trying to say that she's going to be doing all the paperwork and he's just dropping the money off at the dealer to hold the gun. I'm not sure why in that case he'd even mention waiting the 30 days to put it in his name.\nDropping off a deposit is not \"buying\" a gun. It's just running an errand for someone. The actual purchase and subsequent 10 day waiting period etc. wouldn't start until she went down to fill out the paperwork. That would be an actual face to face transaction with the dealer and the eventual gun owner.\nI'd agree that anything else would be sketchy at best. Certainly the dealer can't start the DROS until she comes in to actually buy the gun. In that case the only reason I can see for him to \"pay for it\" is as a deposit to hold the gun. In either case he's not getting the gun any sooner than if he just had her pay for her own gun when she came in. Hell the dealer could refund his deposit to him and that would release the gun for sale to her.\nIf he wants the gun in his name, he should be able to drop off the deposit and just wait till his 30 days is up.

(AP) \u2014 Dr. Byron Maas surveys a supply of marijuana products for dogs that lines a shelf in his veterinary clinic. They're selling well. \n\"The 'Up and Moving' is for joints and for pain,\" he explains. \"The 'Calm and Quiet' is for real anxious dogs, to take away that anxiety.\" \nPeople anxious to relieve suffering in their pets are increasingly turning to oils and powders that contain CBDs, a non-psychoactive component of marijuana. But there's little data on whether they work, or if they have harmful side effects. \nThat's because Washington has been standing in the way of clinical trials, veterinarians and researchers say. Now, a push is underway to have barriers removed, so both pets and people can benefit. \nThose barriers have had more than just a chilling effect. \nWhen the federal Drug Enforcement Administration announced last year that even marijuana extracts with CBD and little or no THC - marijuana's intoxicating component - are an illegal Schedule 1 drug, the University of Pennsylvania halted its clinical trials. Colorado State University is pushing ahead. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned companies that sell marijuana products online and via pet shops and animal hospitals that they're violating laws by offering \"unapproved new animal drugs.\" The FDA threatened legal action. \nBut, seeing potential benefits of CBDs, the American Veterinary Medical Association's policy-making body said last summer it wants the DEA to declassify marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug \"to facilitate research opportunities for veterinary and human medical uses.\" It asked the board of the national veterinarians' organization to investigate working with other stakeholders toward that goal. The board is awaiting a recommendation from two group councils. \n\"The concern our membership has is worry about people extrapolating their own dosages, looking to medicate their pets outside the realm of the medical professional,\" Board Chairman Michael Whitehair said in a telephone interview. \"This is an important reason for us to continue the research.\" \nUtah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a conservative Republican, became an unlikely champion of this push when he introduced a bill in September that would open the path for more clinical research. While Hatch said he opposes recreational marijuana use, he wants marijuana-based drugs, regulated by the FDA, produced for people with disorders. \n\"We lack the science to support use of medical marijuana products like CBD oils, not because researchers are unwilling to do the work, but because of bureaucratic red tape and over-regulation,\" Hatch said. \nDawn Boothe, of Auburn University's College of Veterinary Medicine, is waiting for federal approval to begin a study of marijuana's effects on dogs with epilepsy. The classification of marijuana products containing CBD as a Schedule 1 drug, the same category as heroin and LSD, creates a \"major, major, major, terrible roadblock\" for researchers, Boothe said in a phone interview. \nResearchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine were studying CBDs' effects on dogs with osteoarthritis and pruritis, or itchiness, until the DEA released its policy statement. \n\"The ambiguity in this process has really brought us to a screeching halt,\" said Michael DiGregorio, director of the university's clinical trials center. \"It is research that needs to be done, because there are a lot of CBD products out there.\" \nWhen it clarified that marijuana CBD extracts are Schedule 1 drugs, the DEA said it was assigning a code number to those substances to better track them and to comply with international drug control treaties. \nDiGregorio complained that researchers seeking federal approval to study CBD products are told to provide certain data, but that data isn't normally available until the study is done. \n\"If you don't have the data, you can't get the registration to do the work,\" he said. \nOn a recent morning, Maas took a break from seeing four-legged patients in the Bend Veterinary Clinic. A stethoscope dangling from his neck over green scrubs, Maas said his clients have reported CBDs help relieve pain, arthritis, anxiety, loss of appetite, epilepsy and inflammation in their pets. \n\"Unfortunately there's not a lot of research out there, especially on animals, on CBD compounds,\" Maas said. \"The research is really necessary to help us understand how to actually use these compounds on our pets.\" \nVeterinarian Janet Ladyga of the Blue Sky Veterinary Clinic, also in Bend, said she doesn't recommend marijuana products because of the unknowns. \n\"We don't have a lot of evidence right now, so we don't know the toxicity or the safety profile ... and we don't have any good evidence to show either if it's safe or efficacious,\" she said. \nThe study at Colorado State University aims to provide some data. The roughly two dozen dogs in the arthritis study and the 30 in the epilepsy tests are given either CBD oil or a placebo. For the arthritis study, activity monitors are attached to the animals' collars, to determine if they're more mobile when they're taking CBD. \nPrincipal investigator Stephanie McGrath said she hopes the results will be a stepping stone for longer and more diverse studies, and that they provide useful information for human medicine. \n\"Every medication we're taking has been given to a dog first,\" the University of Pennsylvania's DiGregorio noted. \nMeanwhile, Boothe said she had everything ready to start her study in January, and was waiting for a green light from federal officials. \n\"I don't know what's taking so long,\" she said. \n___", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dawn boothe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "byron maas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael whitehair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael digregorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet ladyga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie mcgrath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orrin hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digregorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boothe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "american veterinary medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blue sky veterinary clinic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auburn university's college of veterinary medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania school of veterinary medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drug enforcement administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado state university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ore.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tweet  bend", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:02.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce08975c5295cf220cc93ad22f452a9941546bf8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_WfX6.eHo6jCYfKVYOUS3mvy0CnVkbeRmPS8XYtQ8RR6H1OOtLN7blAsDjvWcuDC1JzHOKmyNRNQ--", "site_full": "www.unseenservant.us", "site": "unseenservant.us", "site_section": "http://www.unseenservant.us/forum/viewforum.php?f=289", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "The Unseen Servant forums \u2022 View forum - The Rise of Smaug (Burning Wheel)", "title": "Discussion - Character Concepts", "title_full": "The Unseen Servant forums \u2022 View topic - Discussion - Character Concepts", "published": "2017-11-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://unseenservant.us/forum/images/forums.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f89266228b762b2a43d4488d2d063962a01b4745", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_WfX6.eHo6jCYfKVYOUS3mvy0CnVkbeRmPS8XYtQ8RR6H1OOtLN7blAsDjvWcuDC22er8qzDS_.O7Bcfqaah9E", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "Spectreman17", "published": "2017-11-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hey all,\nI was part of the first run of this game. we played 4 Life paths.

Socialism, as its name suggests, is based on a belief in the notion of action through the community, in the idea that individuals do not stand alone, and that it is not merely morally right that we should think of ourselves in this way but that it is the most rational way to organise our lives. The world we face today makes a socialist approach all the more relevant: from new technology to the arms race, co-operation surely makes more sense than competition. \u201d\n\u201c Post-war Britain has seen two big changes. First, and partly as a result of reforming Labour governments, there are many more healthy, wealthy and well-educated people than before. In addition, employment has switched from traditional manufacturing industries to a more white-collar, service-based economy. The inevitable result has been that class identity has fragmented. Only about a third of the population now regard themselves as \u2018working-class\u2019. Of course it is possible still to analyse Britain in terms of a strict Marxist definition of class: but it is not very helpful to our understanding of how the country thinks and votes. In fact, of that third, many are likely not to be \u2018working\u2019 at all: these are the unemployed, pensioners, single parents \u2013 in other words, the poor.\nA party that restricts its appeal to the traditional working class will not win an election. That doesn\u2019t entail a rejection of socialism\u2019s traditional values: but it does mean that its appeal, and hence its policies, must address a much wider range of interests. \u201d\n\u201c The trick for Labour is not to follow them and abandon the notion of government and collective provision: but to re-fashion it so that real power is exercised by people and not by institutions or bureaucracies. The fundamental error of Dr Owen (and, oddly, of David Steel since the election, though not before it) has been to surrender to Mrs Thatcher\u2019s philosophy and say that power can only be devolved through the market. The 1990s will not see the continuing triumph of the market, but its failure. \u201d\n\nRoy Hattersley: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/24/labour2001to2005.news\n\u201c Tony Blair discovered a big idea. His destiny is to create a meritocracy. Unfortunately meritocracy is not the form of society which social democrats want to see. ... A Labour government should not be talking about escape routes from poverty and deprivation. By their nature they are only available to a highly-motivated minority. The Labour Party was created to change society in such a way that there is no poverty and deprivation from which to escape . ... The certain knowledge that the Conservative Party would be a worse government than Labour is not enough to sustain what used to be a party of principles. ...

Taking Verrain's character to Adventurer makes the majority of the party Outcasts from dwarven society BEFORE the dragon made the society collapse. It will definitely color the direction and content of the tale.\nI'm fine if you all end up Outcasts. Your beliefs should include that fact, and you're likely to have to deal with needy \"proper\" dwarves who are now finding themselves in your turf.\nI also like you not being all Outcasts. Having a few \"normal dwarves\" displaced by Smaug as main characters in the story helps keep the contrast clearer.\nFor Verrain's character:\nIf you don't want to be a social outcast, then I'd suggest taking Wordbearer twice (Born Guilder --> Wordbearer --> Wordbearer --> Horncaller). That lets you stay focused on what you're aiming for without diluting it with a different career twist at the end. (This is what Durgar Ironpull did with Banner Bearer.) You can also look at \"who has the lore\" for each dwarven subsetting. Wordbearers have it for Guilders. Hornbearer is a nice touch. Abdecarts have it for nobles, but only if born noble. Which leaves Clansmen - where it is Husband/Wife and Graybeard. You could go Born Guilder --> Wordbearer --> Horncaller --> Husband, having settled down as a respectable adult. With this route, you end up with Hold-wise, Rumor-wise, Clan History, Clan-Wise, Family-Wise, Oratory, and Soothing Platitudes. You could also just be rounded out as a respectable young dwarven host guy. Born Guilder --> Wordbearer --> Horncaller --> Foot Soldier. You get required Foraging skill and Salt of the Earth trait. If you're okay becoming an Outcast (and frowned-on by respectable dwarves as an adventurer), that does have a lot to offer. You can go the Mental route if Rusty is going the Physical route - in that case, adventurer offers twice as many skill points and the options of Obscure History, Symbology, and Lost Treasure-wise.

Applying these tips should help you save money on your premium, no matter what type of car or truck you drive.\nIf your car is considered a classic vehicle, you can get what is known as classic car insurance. http://www.wafb.com/story/36936727/news is often far less expensive than traditional insurance. If your car is of extreme value though, you will want to insure it for enough to replace it in the event it is wrecked or stolen.\nAs you choose car insurance, be sure to properly protect yourself when it comes to liability for property damage and bodily injury. The right amount of coverage in this area can make a big difference in the event of an accident. Not having enough coverage can leave you with a lawsuit that can be hard to recover from.\nTo save money on auto insurance, be sure to take your children off of your policy once they\u2019ve moved out on their own. If they are still at college, you may be able to get a discount through a distant student credit. These can apply when your child is attending school a certain distance from home.\nKnowing what coverage you have with car insurance can help you to understand what exactly you\u2019re paying for. Things like collision coverage can cover damages to your car but only up to its book value. This kind of insurance carries a deductible. Your premium will be higher if you choose a low deductible.\nIf you own an older model vehicle, drop your collision coverage. Most policies have a limited amount collision coverage, that will not pay for more than the blue book value. Investigate how auto insurance benefits is worth, and then figure out how much the added collision coverage will cost you. Paying the extra coverage amount is sometimes not worth your while.\nYou should be talking to your insurance agents before you even decide on a car. This is because the insurance should influence which models of car you are looking at. Some cars have a surcharge that will increase your policy price, but others come with discounts. See which options come with a discount and then consider if these cars would suit you.\nIf you have developed a history of trouble-free driving over the course of several years, inquire with your car insurance company about a no-claim discount. Many companies offer these discounts for reliable customers they have not had to pay-out for. Some companies apply no-claim discounts automatically; with others the driver must inquire. It never hurts to ask!\nIf you have memberships in any organizations, it would be to your advantage to ask your carrier if they offer discounts to members of these organizations. Doing so could help you save even more money on your insurance premiums. For example, some companies may offer discounts to state employees or members of auto clubs. It never hurts to ask!\nEven if you need money badly, you should never manufacture a fake claim or make the damages appear worst than they are. Your insurance company will probably notice that you are trying to cheat them. You could get in trouble and your premium could go up because of this. Keep in mind that you are dealing with professionals.\nIf you already have or are thinking about getting another car, call your auto insurance provider. This is because many people do not know that you can put more than one car on one plan. By having all of your cars insured under the same plan, you could potentially save thousands of dollars.\nYou will want to make sure to contact your insurance company if you get a divorce and no longer want your ex to be on your policy. If they get into an accident while they are on your insurance policy, it could cause your rates to go up, and you will have to pay for their mistake for the rest of the time you have a policy with that company.\nWhen you get a quote for your auto insurance don\u2019t overvalue your vehicle. This will only cause your rates to be higher and cost you more money in the long run. In the case of an accident, you will only be paid for the market value of your car anyway.\nIf you are purchasing car insurance on a new vehicle on which there will be a lien, you should be aware that you must, by law, have full coverage. In this case, you may even want to reconsider your new car purchase because full coverage is significantly more expensive than liability alone.\n\nMake sure that you do your end of the research and know what company you are signing with. The tips above are a great start on your search for the right company. Hopefully you will save some money in the process!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:03.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "486ebc3e3b5226ba1e49bb35ed9b1adc31edf854", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl4LNPowJe7fex2P0eBjpRdlmVGy.N8aTQhzDGhBWzGUz0PSWEVTgRJiqAcEtstQdDqdV8LSWHNr3SzdZD.UT.rGYmB24zNcniPgsJGlU_bu1uz4hUPQbQp4-", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[Star Wars Battlefront 2] Come for the hero fights, stay for the Rebellion. 44", "title_full": "[Star Wars Battlefront 2] Come for the hero fights, stay for the Rebellion. - Page 44 \u2014 Penny Arcade", "published": "2017-12-06T03:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 34, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/8DDBNVR065TV.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8253, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c2ef80ad40d081e7ae1f74d226c9001acc00902a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl4LNPowJe7fex2P0eBjpRdlmVGy.N8aTQhzDGhBWzGUz0PSWEVTgRJiqAcEtstQdDqdV8LSWHNr3SzdZD.UT.rGYmB24zNcniPgsJGlU_bu1DOPAMV5at9j7bDpKtb0DgQ--", "ord_in_thread": 26, "author": "Betsuni", "published": "2017-12-07T00:14:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Yay, so managed to snag this at Target last night.

She fears the night when the beasts run ravenous around her bedroom. Her mother arrives in her room for her usual bed time story, telling her about wonderful and magical creatures which roam the fairylands for years on end, and brave Knights defeating the dragon and saving the helpless princess. But once the tales stop, the terror begins. The light goes out and the creatures come to play. Toying with the lights, scratching at the bed post, casting disfigured like shadows on the petrified girls bedroom walls, terrorizing her until the morning comes, the long night drags and the morning feels as if it\u2019s edging further and further away and the monsters continue to linger creating fear and bringing the young girl\u2019s nightmares to life. Suddenly, she wakes. It was all a dream. The Girl, still unsure of the terrors gets out of bed to check for the evidence of the evil monsters lingering in her bed, upon looking under the bed she discovers an unwanted visitor staring right back at her. But surely it was just a dream? Or was it?\nStory Board \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null,

Socialism, as its name suggests, is based on a belief in the notion of action through the community, in the idea that individuals do not stand alone, and that it is not merely morally right that we should think of ourselves in this way but that it is the most rational way to organise our lives. The world we face today makes a socialist approach all the more relevant: from new technology to the arms race, co-operation surely makes more sense than competition. \u201d\n\u201c Post-war Britain has seen two big changes. First, and partly as a result of reforming Labour governments, there are many more healthy, wealthy and well-educated people than before. In addition, employment has switched from traditional manufacturing industries to a more white-collar, service-based economy. The inevitable result has been that class identity has fragmented. Only about a third of the population now regard themselves as \u2018working-class\u2019. Of course it is possible still to analyse Britain in terms of a strict Marxist definition of class: but it is not very helpful to our understanding of how the country thinks and votes. In fact, of that third, many are likely not to be \u2018working\u2019 at all: these are the unemployed, pensioners, single parents \u2013 in other words, the poor.\nA party that restricts its appeal to the traditional working class will not win an election. That doesn\u2019t entail a rejection of socialism\u2019s traditional values: but it does mean that its appeal, and hence its policies, must address a much wider range of interests. \u201d\n\u201c The trick for Labour is not to follow them and abandon the notion of government and collective provision: but to re-fashion it so that real power is exercised by people and not by institutions or bureaucracies. The fundamental error of Dr Owen (and, oddly, of David Steel since the election, though not before it) has been to surrender to Mrs Thatcher\u2019s philosophy and say that power can only be devolved through the market. The 1990s will not see the continuing triumph of the market, but its failure. \u201d\n\nRoy Hattersley: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/24/labour2001to2005.news\n\u201c Tony Blair discovered a big idea. His destiny is to create a meritocracy. Unfortunately meritocracy is not the form of society which social democrats want to see. ... A Labour government should not be talking about escape routes from poverty and deprivation. By their nature they are only available to a highly-motivated minority. The Labour Party was created to change society in such a way that there is no poverty and deprivation from which to escape . ...

A Geneva-based think-tank, ACAPS, made the prediction in a report published on Thursday\n\n\nACAPS, a non-profit venture that supports humanitarian aid workers with daily monitoring and analysis of 150 countries, examined the anticipated needs of 18 countries in 2018 and found little to cheer.\n\nSome children with stunted growth \u201cIf 2017 did not look good, predictions for 2018 are no better: violence and insecurity are likely to deteriorate in Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Libya, Ethiopia, Mali, Somalia, and Syria in 2018,\u201d ACAPS director Lars Nissen wrote in the report. In 2018, Ethiopia will join northeast Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen as places at risk of famine, said the report, entitled \u201cHumanitarian Overview: An analysis of key crises into 2018\u201d. Rather than bringing stability, the prospect of elections in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, South Sudan and Venezuela is expected to exacerbate tensions and fuel violence. Islamic extremism will also continue to cause death and conflict, the report said. Inspite of the defeat of Islamic State in its main strongholds in Iraq, the group is expected to continue improvised attacks throughout the country to destabilise the government, as well as gaining strength and resources in southern Libya. Islamic State is also likely to increase its small position in the Puntland region of Somalia, impacting the civilian population and clashing with its bigger regional rival Al-Shabaab, which will increase the lethality of its own attacks. Islamist armed groups are also expected to take advantage of the withdrawal of government troops from central Mali, gaining local recruits and further influence, while in Afghanistan the Taliban will consolidate their rural strongholds and increased opium production will boost funding for armed groups. ACAPS said the fragmentation of armed groups in Central African Republic is expected to worsen the violence there, sending more refugees into Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo. \u201cMilitia groups previously focused on local grievances will likely become increasingly frustrated by the national, political, and socioeconomic situation and are likely to increase violence, particularly against government forces and institutions,\u201d ACAPS said.\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "acaps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lars nissen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "taliban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameroon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south sudan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "somalia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic republic of congo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puntland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central african republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethiopia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:04.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e9bc379b862410837264bd69701a1ff8985bfb6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.e4oCB90yHB3mnxBlvJ0KA-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:17:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e9bc379b862410837264bd69701a1ff8985bfb6a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.e4oCB90yHB3mnxBlvJ0KA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "417b92a291230bc55317edaf21cdf187", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:04.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "486ebc3e3b5226ba1e49bb35ed9b1adc31edf854", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl4LNPowJe7fex2P0eBjpRdlmVGy.N8aTQhzDGhBWzGUz0PSWEVTgRJiqAcEtstQdDqdV8LSWHNr3SzdZD.UT.rGYmB24zNcniPgsJGlU_bu1uz4hUPQbQp4-", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[Star Wars Battlefront 2] Come for the hero fights, stay for the Rebellion. 44", "title_full": "[Star Wars Battlefront 2] Come for the hero fights, stay for the Rebellion. - Page 44 \u2014 Penny Arcade", "published": "2017-12-06T03:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 34, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/8DDBNVR065TV.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8253, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fcc8b80c5af3135a774b5ac78a49de6f0be6ddcc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl4LNPowJe7fex2P0eBjpRdlmVGy.N8aTQhzDGhBWzGUz0PSWEVTgRJiqAcEtstQdDqdV8LSWHNr3SzdZD.UT.rGYmB24zNcniPgsJGlU_bu1DOPAMV5at9hvyDxRt8LyEA--", "ord_in_thread": 28, "author": "Betsuni", "published": "2017-12-07T00:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : \u00bb If anybody ever wants to try to group up on the PS4, add me as a friend.

That\u2019s for how I\u2019ll be scheduling it! \nThe way I do Blogmas itself is also going to be different, since I plan on publishing 2 types of Blogmas posts ! There\u2019ll be posts which are more Christmas-Themed (like: Xmas Wishlist, Xmas Playlist, Xmas Tag, Xmas Q&A). \nAnd there\u2019ll be other posts which aren\u2019t really festive-related, but I assure you will be interesting & relevant to this Special Time of the Year \u2013 since we\u2019re approaching a New Year\u20262018! \n\nConfession Time\u2026.This is the first time doing Blogmas, and I really hope you\u2019ll enjoy all my posts throughout the month! \nAlso, there will be a VERY exciting post coming up near the end of the month \u2013 which happens to be my 1 Year Blogiversary ! I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been almost a year! But it\u2019s definitely been an AMAZING Blogging Journey that I\u2019ve enjoyed! \nSO: Welcome To My 1st BLOGMAS Post!\nMany Students Around The World & Friends (including me) have Exams & Mocks this Month or in January, and I must admit it\u2019s hard staying focused during all the excitement of Xmas and the New Year and the Holidays!\nEven if you aren\u2019t a student or Even if you are\u2026All of us no doubtedly have Goals & Wishes or Resolutions we hope to achieve in 2018!

http://www.lrb.co.uk/v09/n19/tony-blair/diary\n\n\u201c But there is nothing more ridiculous than the notion that socialism is inexorably dying, or has been compulsorily retired on grounds of redundancy. Socialism, as its name suggests, is based on a belief in the notion of action through the community, in the idea that individuals do not stand alone, and that it is not merely morally right that we should think of ourselves in this way but that it is the most rational way to organise our lives. The world we face today makes a socialist approach all the more relevant: from new technology to the arms race, co-operation surely makes more sense than competition. \u201d\n\u201c Post-war Britain has seen two big changes. First, and partly as a result of reforming Labour governments, there are many more healthy, wealthy and well-educated people than before. In addition, employment has switched from traditional manufacturing industries to a more white-collar, service-based economy. The inevitable result has been that class identity has fragmented. Only about a third of the population now regard themselves as \u2018working-class\u2019. Of course it is possible still to analyse Britain in terms of a strict Marxist definition of class: but it is not very helpful to our understanding of how the country thinks and votes. In fact, of that third, many are likely not to be \u2018working\u2019 at all: these are the unemployed, pensioners, single parents \u2013 in other words, the poor.\nA party that restricts its appeal to the traditional working class will not win an election. That doesn\u2019t entail a rejection of socialism\u2019s traditional values: but it does mean that its appeal, and hence its policies, must address a much wider range of interests. \u201d\n\u201c The trick for Labour is not to follow them and abandon the notion of government and collective provision: but to re-fashion it so that real power is exercised by people and not by institutions or bureaucracies. The fundamental error of Dr Owen (and, oddly, of David Steel since the election, though not before it) has been to surrender to Mrs Thatcher\u2019s philosophy and say that power can only be devolved through the market. The 1990s will not see the continuing triumph of the market, but its failure. \u201d\n\nRoy Hattersley: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/24/labour2001to2005.news\n\u201c Tony Blair discovered a big idea. His destiny is to create a meritocracy. Unfortunately meritocracy is not the form of society which social democrats want to see. ... A Labour government should not be talking about escape routes from poverty and deprivation. By their nature they are only available to a highly-motivated minority. The Labour Party was created to change society in such a way that there is no poverty and deprivation from which to escape . ...
