The alliance could see Ford utilize T-Mall to sell cars to consumers \u2014 the company has sold items like cargo jets via Taobao before \u2014 but there could be room for collaboration within Alibaba\u2019s \u2018Next Retail\u2019 strategy that unites online and offline commerce. \nThe Chinese giant recently invested in national hypermarket operator Sun Retail in a move that it hopes will increase the synergies between e-commerce and physical retailing, and automotive is one vertical where that mesh is more obviously beneficial. People like to touch, feel and drive cars before they buy them, but yet doing basic research and purchasing online is more productive than visiting multiple showrooms. \nA source also indicated that Alibaba may consider a \u201cvending machine\u201d style approach to selling cars. We\u2019ve seen such an approach before \u2014 like this compact 15-story operation in Singapore that looks like a child\u2019s toy box and examples in Germany \u2014 and that could be one branch of Alibaba\u2019s retail strategy in the future. \nAutobahn Motors\u2019 vending machine showroom in Singapore \nBeyond sales, the companies said they will explore opportunities to work together on technology, including cloud computing for big data analysis, digital marketing services and using Alibaba\u2019s AliOS operating system. \nChina\u2019s state-owned media predicted than more than 800,000 green vehicles would be sold this year, up more than 50 percent on 2016, thanks in no small part to a government incentive that covers 26 different models. Data is scant, but that\u2019s almost certain to make China the world\u2019s largest market for electric vehicles. Already it has attracted Tesla, which is planning its own China-based factory , while VW is among the international firms that has invested in order to make its mark in the country. \n\u201cChina is one of the world\u2019s largest and most dynamic digital markets, thriving on innovation with customers\u2019 online and offline experiences converging rapidly. Collaborating with leading technology players builds on our vision for smart vehicles in a smart world to reimagine and revolutionize consumers\u2019 mobility experiences,\u201d Jim Hackett, Ford President and CEO, said in a statement. \nExecutive chairman William C. Ford Jr. was even more direct in his assessment of the importance of China. \n\u201cWhen I think of where E.V.s are going, it\u2019s clearly the case that China will lead the world in E.V. development,\u201d he told the New York Times . \nAlibaba announced its first internet car in partnership with Chinese firm SAIC last year \u2014 the vehicle runs AliOS \u2014 and it claims to be powering more than 400,000 vehicles across China\u2019s roads today. This deal with Ford might not culminate in a Ford car running AliOS, but it does represent a first deal between Alibaba and an automaker from outside of China. That makes it a significant tie-in even the exact nature of the arrangement is rather frustratingly unclear at this point.

Had a great visit with him. Its been a process that we tried to evaluate every piece that we can. We wanted to uncover every stone, lift it and check it all out, and I think its been a really good process.Marrone replaces George Yarno, who left the team last June to begin cancer treatment. Assistant Luke Butkus served as the interim line coach this season.With two rookies and two second-year players starting on the line, the Jaguars gave up a franchise-record 71 sacks. Two days after the season ended, Bradley said he expected Yarno to return in 2015.Clearly, something changed.Bradley interviewed Marrone last week. The Jaguars, who are coaching the South team at the Senior Bowl this week, still need to hire an offensive co-ordinator.Bradley met with six candidates for the job, which opened when Jedd Fisch was fired after the season. Oakland offensive co-ordinator Greg Olson and former Denver offensive co-ordinator Adam Gase appear to be finalists for the opening.No major decisions have been made yet, Bradley said. Were still going through that, the process with that, but hopefully itll come together soon.The Jaguars will sell Marrones hiring as a home run, being able to get someone with his experience to help steer a young offence.Just about everyone else will see it as Marrone making a questionable choice to leave Buffalo.Co-Bills owner Terry Pegula said he was shocked, by Marrones abrupt departure on New Years Eve. Safety Aaron Williams blasted Marrone in a tweet, posting Lost all respect!!Running back Fred Jackson referred to Rex Ryan as an upgrade at coach. And Ryan said during his introductory news conference that the Bills deserve to have a loyal coach \u2014 a clear shot at Marrone.Marrone stepped down after leading the Bills to a 9-7 record. It was the teams first winning season since 2004.An opt-out clause in Marrones contract was triggered when Pegula and his wife, Kim, bought the team in October. The club was sold after Hall of Fame owner Ralph Wilson died in March.Marrone went 15-17 in Buffalo. He was hired after four seasons at Syracuse, where he helped revive his alma maters struggling program.Marrone spent seven seasons in the NFL (2002-08) before becoming a college head coach. He served as offensive co-ordinator for New Orleans (2006-08), and was offensive line coach for the New York Jets for four seasons before that.What he brings to the table is experience, Bradley said. Hes had a great background with the offensive line. Hes a developmental coach and hes proven that over the years that he coached the offensive line with things that he did when he was in New Orleans, and just the impact hes had even in Buffalo and Syracuse. I think thats what we need with our offensive line.___AP Sports Writer John Wawrow in Buffalo, New York, contributed to this report.___AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Aaron Ramsey Jersey .

The triple gold medallist from the 2010 Paralympics tweeted on Tuesday: \"Woke up with a virus yesterday. Timing couldnt be much worse. Not the ideal prep for the .Paralympics. Its been a bumpy .RoadToSochi.\" A Canadian official said in an email that McKeever has a cold but is expected to participate in Fridays opening ceremony. McKeever -- who is legally blind -- has 10 Paralympic medals to his name, including seven gold. The 34-year-old from Canmore, Alta., became the first athlete named to a countrys Olympic and Paralympic teams when he qualified for the Vancouver Games four years ago.

The back street (free clue!) concerned had no working street lights adjacent, only overspill from those some distance away. And as should be known by now, I only do hand-held (or available support), no tripods or clamps.\nThis one was tricky, as the flat scene almost defeated the autofocus, and it was too dark to distinguish focus in the viewfinder.\nThankfully one shot came out half decent before I had to fall back on a really really high ISO, and could be post processed into something useable.\nI might add that \u2018Yorick\u2019 is a big clue, and came from a chat while in a shop in his shadow, where the kindly owner dropped the name after I mentioned spotting my prey.\nYorick I had no idea he was so damned BIG!\nOn reflection, it was probably fortunate the adjacent street lights were dead.\nI\u2019ve been analysing a lot of low-light pics, and have noted that many which include individual sources such as street lights can end up with compromised exposure. The illuminated parts can \u2018burn out\u2019 with over-exposure, while shadow detail can be buried and vastly underexposed as a result.\nWhile the lack of a nearby light can make a pic hard to get (hand-held remember) due to the extended exposure time needed, the result is often better as the more even lighting means no losses due to shadow or highlight exposure compromises.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "iso", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:43.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "edba5637a9e0c55ea1bf4f361354aab740363128", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl24u_ryQp9fKyPD5pACxmqYKotMKNvkrYt8VeN.j4I1rxgTm.hSR0HYMS6dk3MakFg--", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "The latest [Giant Bomb] thread!

Revenue per student also grew to $8,079, a 6.6 percent year-on-year increase that was primarily driven by tuition fee increases and the grade ageing effect. \nAccording to the results, GEMS also deployed $343 million of capital expenditure, including $318 million of school capital expenditure for the 2017 fiscal year. Since 2014, GEMS\u2019 cumulative investment in schools and transport assets has totaled over $1 billion. \nAcross the 47 GEMS schools, enrolment rose 10 percent to 114,000 students, from 104,200 the previous year.

Let\u2019s go through an example: \nBefore I warn you not to eat cheese because you may die in your bedsheets, I\u2019m obliged to check that it isn\u2019t any of the following: Complete coincidence \u2013 Is it possible that so many datasets were compared, that some were bound to be similar? Why, that\u2019s exactly what Tyler Vigen did! Yes, this is possible. Reverse causation \u2013 Is it possible that we have this the wrong way around? For example, perhaps your relatives, in mourning for your bedsheet-related death, eat cheese in large quantities to comfort themselves? This seems pretty unlikely, so let\u2019s give it a pass. No, this is very unlikely. Joint causation \u2013 Is it possible that some third factor is behind both of these? Maybe increasing affluence makes you healthier (so you don\u2019t die of things like malnutrition), and also causes you to eat more cheese? This seems very plausible. Yes, this is possible. Linearity \u2013 Are we comparing two linear trends? A linear trend is a steady rate of growth or decline. Any two statistics which are both roughly linear over time will be very well correlated. In the graph above, both our statistics are trending linearly upwards. If the graph was drawn with different scales, they might look completely unrelated, like this , but because they both have a steady rate, they\u2019d still be very well correlated. Yes, this looks likely. Broad applicability \u2013 Is it possible that this relationship only exists in certain niche scenarios, or, at least, not in my niche scenario? Perhaps, for example, cheese does this to some people, and that\u2019s been enough to create this correlation, because there are so few bedsheet-tangling fatalities otherwise? Yes, this seems possible. \nSo we have 4 \u201c Yes \u201d answers and one \u201c No \u201d answer from those 5 checks. \nIf your example doesn\u2019t get 5 \u201c No \u201d answers from those 5 checks, it\u2019s a fail, and you don\u2019t get to say that the study has established either a ranking factor or a fatal side effect of cheese consumption. \nA similar process should apply to case studies, which are another form of correlation \u2014 the correlation between you making a change, and something good (or bad!) happening. For example, ask: Have I ruled out other factors (e.g. external demand, seasonality, competitors making mistakes)? Did I increase traffic by doing the thing I tried to do, or did I accidentally improve some other factor at the same time? Did this work because of the unique circumstance of the particular client/project? \nThis is particularly challenging for SEOs, because we rarely have data of this quality, but I\u2019d suggest an additional pair of questions to help you navigate this minefield: If I were Google, would I do this? If I were Google, could I do this? \nDirect traffic as a ranking factor passes the \u201ccould\u201d test, but only barely \u2014 Google could use data from Chrome, Android, or ISPs, but it\u2019d be sketchy. It doesn\u2019t really pass the \u201cwould\u201d test, though \u2014 it\u2019d be far easier for Google to use branded search traffic, which would answer the same questions you might try to answer by comparing direct traffic levels (e.g. how popular is this website?). 2. Missing the context \nIf I told you that my traffic was up 20% week on week today, what would you say? Congratulations? \nWhat if it was up 20% this time last year? \nWhat if I told you it had been up 20% year on year, up until recently? \nIt\u2019s funny how a little context can completely change this. This is another problem with case studies and their evil inverted twin, traffic drop analyses. \nIf we really want to understand whether to be surprised at something, positively or negatively, we need to compare it to our expectations, and then figure out what deviation from our expectations is \u201cnormal.\u201d If this is starting to sound like statistics, that\u2019s because it is statistics \u2014 indeed, I wrote about a statistical approach to measuring change way back in 2015 . \nIf you want to be lazy, though, a good rule of thumb is to zoom out, and add in those previous years. And if someone shows you data that is suspiciously zoomed in, you might want to take it with a pinch of salt. 3. Trusting our tools \nWould you make a multi-million dollar business decision based on a number that your competitor could manipulate at will? Well, chances are you do, and the number can be found in Google Analytics. I\u2019ve covered this extensively in other places , but there are some major problems with most analytics platforms around: How easy they are to manipulate externally How arbitrarily they group hits into sessions How vulnerable they are to ad blockers How they perform under sampling, and how obvious they make this \nFor example, did you know that the Google Analytics API v3 can heavily sample data whilst telling you that the data is unsampled, above a certain amount of traffic (~500,000 within date range)? Neither did I, until we ran into it whilst building Distilled ODN. \nSimilar problems exist with many \u201cSearch Analytics\u201d tools. My colleague Sam Nemzer has written a bunch about this \u2014 did you know that most rank tracking platforms report completely different rankings ? Or how about the fact that the keywords grouped by Google (and thus tools like SEMRush and STAT, too) are not equivalent , and don\u2019t necessarily have the volumes quoted? \nIt\u2019s important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of tools that we use, so that we can at least know when they\u2019re directionally accurate (as in, their insights guide you in the right direction), even if not perfectly accurate. All I can really recommend here is that skilling up in SEO (or any other digital channel) necessarily means understanding the mechanics behind your measurement platforms \u2014 which is why all new starts at Distilled end up learning how to do analytics audits. \nOne of the most common solutions to the root problem is combining multiple data sources, but\u2026 4. Combining data sources \nThere are numerous platforms out there that will \u201cdefeat (not provided)\u201d by bringing together data from two or more of: Analytics AdWords Rank tracking \nThe problems here are that, firstly, these platforms do not have equivalent definitions, and secondly, ironically, (not provided) tends to break them. \nLet\u2019s deal with definitions first, with an example \u2014 let\u2019s look at a landing page with a channel: In Search Console, these are reported as clicks , and can be vulnerable to heavy, invisible sampling when multiple dimensions (e.g. keyword and page) or filters are combined. In Google Analytics, these are reported using last non-direct click , meaning that your organic traffic includes a bunch of direct sessions, time-outs that resumed mid-session, etc. That\u2019s without getting into dark traffic, ad blockers, etc. In AdWords, most reporting uses last AdWords click , and conversions may be defined differently. In addition, keyword volumes are bundled, as referenced above. Rank tracking is location specific, and inconsistent, as referenced above. \nFine, though \u2014 it may not be precise, but you can at least get to some directionally useful data given these limitations. However, about that \u201c(not provided)\u201d\u2026 \nMost of your landing pages get traffic from more than one keyword. It\u2019s very likely that some of these keywords convert better than others, particularly if they are branded, meaning that even the most thorough click-through rate model isn\u2019t going to help you. So how do you know which keywords are valuable? \nThe best answer is to generalize from AdWords data for those keywords, but it\u2019s very unlikely that you have analytics data for all those combinations of keyword and landing page. Essentially, the tools that report on this make the very bold assumption that a given page converts identically for all keywords. Some are more transparent about this than others. \nAgain, this isn\u2019t to say that those tools aren\u2019t valuable \u2014 they just need to be understood carefully. The only way you could reliably fill in these blanks created by \u201cnot provided\u201d would be to spend a ton on paid search to get decent volume, conversion rate, and bounce rate estimates for all your keywords, and even then, you\u2019ve not fixed the inconsistent definitions issues. Bonus peeve: Average rank \nI still see this way too often. Three questions: Do you care more about losing rankings for ten very low volume queries (10 searches a month or less) than for one high volume query (millions plus)? If the answer isn\u2019t \u201cyes, I absolutely care more about the ten low-volume queries\u201d, then this metric isn\u2019t for you, and you should consider a visibility metric based on click through rate estimates. When you start ranking at 100 for a keyword you didn\u2019t rank for before, does this make you unhappy? If the answer isn\u2019t \u201cyes, I hate ranking for new keywords,\u201d then this metric isn\u2019t for you \u2014 because that will lower your average rank. You could of course treat all non-ranking keywords as position 100, as some tools allow, but is a drop of 2 average rank positions really the best way to express that 1/50 of your landing pages have been de-indexed? Again, use a visibility metric, please. Do you like comparing your performance with your competitors? If the answer isn\u2019t \u201cno, of course not,\u201d then this metric isn\u2019t for you \u2014 your competitors may have more or fewer branded keywords or long-tail rankings, and these will skew the comparison. Again, use a visibility metric. Conclusion \nHopefully, you\u2019ve found this useful. To summarize the main takeaways: Critically analyse correlations & case studies by seeing if you can explain them as coincidences, as reverse causation, as joint causation, through reference to a third mutually relevant factor, or through niche applicability. Don\u2019t look at changes in traffic without looking at the context \u2014 what would you have forecasted for this period, and with what margin of error? Remember that the tools we use have limitations, and do your research on how that impacts the numbers they show. \u201c How has this number been produced?\u201d is an important component in \u201cWhat does this number mean?\u201d If you end up combining data from multiple tools, remember to work out the relationship between them \u2014 treat this information as directional rather than precise. \nLet me know what data analysis fallacies bug you, in the comments below.

Comcast is making that process just a little bit easier thanks to the xFi Advanced Gateway modem and router.

Among those opened, majority were travenas, supermarkets, car rentals and tour agencies. Only a handful of them were for 'tourists shopping' -- boutiques, bookshop etc. The solitary opened shop at the old town was a small grocery shop.\nWe rented a car and went to Sagri, Chalkio , Filoti , Apeiranthos and Moni . All musuems and churches were closed and hence the only attraction we got to visit was the Temple Demeter. Similarly, almost all shops were closed. At Filoti, which is supposed to be the largest village after Naxos, we could find a single restaurant which was opened and nearly had to settle our lunch at the bakery shop. Luckily, we managed to find a small eatery which served crepes.\nDespite all these disappointment, we fully enjoyed our stay at Naxos. For one full morning, we had the Kastro castle and the museum to ourselves. Similarly, not a single person was there to share the beach with us. The drive round the island was enjoyable, as there was hardly any cars on the road. We could stop our car any time we liked to take photos or drive at our own pace.\nOnce again, thanks everyone for all your wonderful advice !!\n2 destinations mentioned in this post 1 Chalkio Naxos, Cyclades, South Aegean, Greece 2 Moni Naxos, Cyclades, South Aegean, Greece See all 2", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/social/no_photo_geo.gif", "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:16:45.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dee712b2eb5898455486016152276e9a676671fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxmlefHEBDqYEtkUGAfzGjbCajb.PR1_tftn.s5z3zBrVC_lqi2Kf0cQi41DJPaOgSzMzgKhlnbQ15WfnS.T5asptWBP6j4sX4CSR.uLPwfOlA.q50g1s2ylTkUxaI16Oo-", "site_full": "ficoforums.myfico.com", "site": "myfico.com", "site_section": "http://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/Credit-Card-Approvals/bd-p/App_Approvals", "site_categories": ["credit_debt_and_loans", "finance"], "section_title": "Credit Card Approvals - myFICO\u00ae Forums", "title": "Navy Federal AMEX Approved - Page 2 5074140", "title_full": "Navy Federal AMEX Approved - Page 2 - myFICO\u00ae Forums - 5074140", "published": "2017-10-26T06:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8044, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0a7610df565e8492a63f921ff500621876142c1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxmlefHEBDqYEtkUGAfzGjbCajb.PR1_tftn.s5z3zBrVC_lqi2Kf0cQi41DJPaOgSzMzgKhlnbQ15WfnS.T5asptWBP6j4sX4CSR.uLPwfOlA.q50g1s2yqC61SGJNu3dHiahVg7ztSA--", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "Miesterbro", "published": "2017-12-07T00:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Congrats \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf88\ud83c\udf7e\ud83c\udf8a.
