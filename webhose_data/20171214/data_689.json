In D.C., shoppers pay 289% more than the national average on gifts.\nTo produce its ranking, Millennial Personal Finance used data from the U.S. Census Bureau cost of living index compiled by real-estate data firm Onboard Analytics. The index was based on the cost of a range of gifts including apparel, accessories, cash, recreation and household furnishings, among other items.\nBut you don\u2019t need to live steps from the White House to be paying more when shopping for gifts than the national average. Alaskans pay nearly double the national average for presents. In eight other states \u2014 Hawaii, New York, Michigan, New Jersey, California, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maryland \u2014 people will fork over upwards of 20% more to buy gifts during the holidays.\nAlso see: These holiday gifts could increase the value of your friend\u2019s home\nIn some cities though, gifts can be even more expensive. Stony Brook, N.Y., is the worst culprit in this regard \u2014 gift shopping there will cost a consumer more than 78 times the national average. Not far behind is East Lansing, Mich., where gifts are nearly 77 times more expensive than the national average.\nAs for the cheapest places to shop, West Virginia and Arkansas are the best at the state-level, with gifts costing 15% less than the national average. And Playa Vista, Calif., a suburb of Los Angeles, is the cheapest metropolitan area on the ranking \u2014 gifts there will be 44% cheaper than the national average.\nDon\u2019t miss: Help your children save for college and pay off student debt\nSo why are some places cheaper than others when it comes to holiday shopping? There\u2019s no one reason. Some point to the Balassa-Samuelson effect, which The Atlantic nicknamed the \u201cnanny effect.\u201d This economic theory suggests that as wages rise in a given location (whether a city, state or country), then prices of goods will also rise.\nReal estate also plays a role \u2014 if rents are more expensive, stores will need to sell more goods or sell them for a higher price to make ends meet. Similarly, if fuel prices are higher in a given place, then transporting items gets more expensive, creating a similar trickle-down effect. That\u2019s likely the case for places like Alaska and Hawaii, which import far more than other states due to their location.\nMore from MarketWatch How to give gifts that truly pay off for friends and family These gifts will improve your life more than a new sweater Read this before you buy someone bitcoin as a gift", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jacob passy  bad", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "onboard analytics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marketwatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. census bureau", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "district of columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mich.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balassa-samuelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stony brook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "playa vista", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east lansing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:47.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "470410fbe037be7487664b8e6fd828aa120bb94c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94oobUZghFoTw5gIVgxPo5Alt959DQC6fIqLCD3ouHjqqgrPzMi4Nc4n5nhydAfTbvdMKrGuj3CA6DWvMu7rWUYlEVhIiiiAYuN2VnrLv1fiRMRV85G9kRIkzbIoMM7qi.2wFx2u4xuKZ_UKhQh06cUSg.Hdonbn5YHPBST3fD6FQy", "site_full": "www.amazon.co.uk", "site": "amazon.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B01LXPJG23/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_cmps_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: tado\u00b0 additional Smart Radiator Thermostat - horizontal mounting - intelligent heating control with geofencing via smartphone", "title": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: tado\u00b0 additional Smart Radiator Thermostat - horizontal mounting - intelligent heating control with geofencing via smartphone", "title_full": "Amazon.co.uk:Customer reviews: tado\u00b0 additional Smart Radiator Thermostat - horizontal mounting - intelligent heating control with geofencing via smartphone", "published": "2017-11-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4280386ac968e07587bcf2955e56e89a544099f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94oobUZghFoTw5gIVgxPo5Alt959DQC6fIqLCD3ouHjqqgrPzMi4Nc4n5nhydAfTbvdMKrGuj3CA6DWvMu7rWUYlEVhIiiiAYuN2VnrLv1fiRMRV85G9kRIkzbIoMM7qi.2wFx2u4xuKZ_UKhQh06cUSg.Hdonbn5YHFzDfOfL2DNJGo351OVb4nH3aR.nw9QTJtTvuu7nvtOD", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "David Lewis", "published": "2017-12-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Like many Eon customers I had my Eon touch system replaced by Eon withthe Tado system. The basic system of Internet bridge, smart thermostat and extension kit worked extremely well and was simple to get used to. I also then decided to replace my Drayton Trv4s and to invest in the smart radiator thermostats.\nI have a 4 bedroom bungalow with 2 ensuites and a family bathroom. In total there are 8 radiators and 3 towel rails that I wished to control individually. 7 of the radiators were fitted with Drayton TRV4s and replacing these with Tado's was very easy. It's just a matter of unscrewing the Drayton head and fitting the Tado's. I Didn't need to use any adaptors and the app gives very clear instructions. Managed to fit all 7 in under an hour. The app lets you pair 2 or more radiators so if you alter the temperature on 1 radiator it automatically adjusts both. Very handy.\nIt soon became apparent that I had a problem with three of my Valves. Not the Tado thermostat part but the actual valves themselves were sticking. WD 40 didn't seem to improve things. It's not surprising that the valves were sticking either open or shut as they hand to been moved in years.\nHaving to replace three valves I took the plunge and decided to fit valves on my three towel rails and the one radiator without a TRV. Most homes have one radiator usually in the hall that has no valve. This has been recommended in the past so that should the boiler be on and pumping water and all the radiator valves are shut the water has somewhere to go. You can leave this radiator alone but what this means in practice is that this radiator will always heat up whenever ANY radiator calls for heat. That clearly is a waste.\nI've now got all radiators and towel rails fitted with Tado smart radiator valves.\nI have set up different temperatures and timers for each room. We used our old wireless thermostat to check temperatures and noticed that the theremostats on the radiators were always reading higher than the actual room temperature meaning the room was colder than the app was saying. This is easily corrected by going into the settings on the app and adjusting the temperature offset. This isn't surprising as the Tado stats are obviously on the radiator where it's going to be warmer.\nThe geofencing option works very well. My wife and I both have the Tado app installed on our phones so when we are both out the heating turns itself off or down automatically.

This article discusses various aspects of Apache Storm Big Data analytics is one of the key areas of research today, and uses assorted approaches in data science and predictive analysis. There are a number of scenarios in which enormous amounts of data are logged every day and need deep evaluation for research and development. In medical science, there are numerous examples where processing, analysis and predictions from huge amounts of data are required regularly. As per reports from First Post, data of more than 50 petabytes is generated from each hospital of 500 beds in the USA. In another research study, it was found that one gram of DNA is equivalent to 215 petabytes in digital data. In another scenario of digital communication, the number of smart wearable gadgets has increased from 26 million in 2014 to more than 100 million in 2016. The key question revolves around the evaluation of huge amounts of data growing at great speed. To preprocess, analyse, evaluate and make predictions on such Big Data based applications, we need high performance computing (HPC) frameworks and libraries, so that the processing power of computers can be used with maximum throughput and performance. There are many free and open source Big Data processing tools that can be used. A few examples of such frameworks are Apache Storm, Apache Hadoop, Lumify, HPCC Systems, Apache Samoa and ElasticSearch. Figure 1: Official portal of Apache Zookeeper Figure 2: Execution pf commands to initialise Apache Zookeeper MapReduce technology Of the above-mentioned tools, Apache Storm is one of the most powerful and performance-oriented real-time distributed computation systems under the free and open source software (FOSS) paradigm. Unbound and free flowing data from multiple channels can be effectively logged and evaluated using Apache Storm with real-time processing, compared to batch processing in Hadoop. In addition, Storm has been effectively adopted by numerous organisations for corporate applications with the integration of some programming language, without any issues of compatibility. The state of clusters and the distributed environment is managed via Apache Zookeeper within the implementation of Apache Storm. Research based algorithms and predictive analytics can be executed in parallel using Apache Storm. MapReduce is a fault-tolerant distributed high performance computational framework which is used to process and evaluate huge amounts of data. MapReduce-like functions can be effectively implemented in Apache Storm using bolts, as the key logical operations are performed at the level of these bolts. In many cases, the performance of bolts in Apache Storm can outperform MapReduce. Key advantages and features of Apache Storm The key advantages and features of Apache Storm are that it is user friendly, free and open source. It is fit for both small and large scale implementations, and is highly fault tolerant and reliable. It is extremely fast, does real-time processing and is scalable. And it performs dynamic load balancing and optimisation using operational intelligence. Figure 3: Download page of Apache storm for multiple platforms Figure 4: Execution of commands to initialise Apache Storm Installing Apache Storm and Zookeeper on a MS Windows environment First, download and install Apache Zookeeper from https://zookeeper.apache.org/. Next, configure and run Zookeeper with the following commands: MSWindowsDrive:\\> cd zookeeper-Version MSWindowsDrive:\\ zookeeper-Version> copy conf\\zoo_sample.cfg conf\\zoo.cfg MSWindowsDrive:\\ zookeeper-Version> .\\bin\\zkServer.cmd The following records are updated in zoo.cfg: tickTime=2000 initLimit=10 syncLimit=5 dataDir= MSWindowsDrive:/zookeeper-3.4.8/data Now, download and install Apache Storm from http://storm.apache.org/ and set STORM_HOME to MSWindowsDrive:\\apache-storm-Version following in environment variables. Figure 5: Apache Storm UI with the base configurations, nodes and cluster information Perform the modifications in storm.yaml as follows: storm.zookeeper.servers: \u2013 \u201c127.0.0.1\u201d nimbus.host: \u201c127.0.0.1\u201d storm.local.dir: \u201cD:/storm/datadir/storm\u201d supervisor.slots.ports: \u2013 6700 \u2013 6701 \u2013 6702 \u2013 6703 In the MS Windows command prompt, go to the path of STORM_HOME and execute the following commands: 1. storm nimbus 2. storm supervisor 3. storm ui In any Web browser, execute the URL http://localhost:8080 to confirm the working of Apache Storm. Apache Storm is associated with a number of key components and modules, which work together to do high performance computing. These components include Nimbus Node, Supervisor Node, Worker Process, Executor, Task and many others. Table 1 gives a brief description of the key components used in the implementation of Apache Storm. Extraction and analytics of Twitter streams using Apache Storm To extract the live data from Twitter, the APIs of Twitter4j are used. These provide the programming interface to connect with Twitter servers. In the Eclipse IDE, the Java code can be programmed for predictive analysis and evaluation of the tweets fetched from real-time streaming channels. As social media mining is one of the key areas of research in order to predict popularity, the code snippets are available at http://opensourceforu.com/article_source_code/2017/nov/ storm.zip can be used to extract the real-time streaming and evaluation of user sentiments. Scope for research and development The extraction of data sets from live satellite channels and cloud delivery points can be implemented using the integrated approach of Apache Storm to make accurate predictions on specific paradigms. As an example, live streaming data that gives the longitude and latitude of a smart gadget can be used to predict the upcoming position of a specific person, using the deep learning based approach. In bioinformatics and medical sciences, the probability of a particular person getting a specific disease can be predicted with the neural network based learning of historical medical records and health parameters using Apache Storm. Besides these, there are many domains in which Big Data analytics can be done for a social cause. These include Aadhaar data sets, banking data sets and rainfall predictions.

(Dec. 7)\nMedia: Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Congress on Thursday passed a stopgap spending bill to prevent a government shutdown this weekend and buy time for challenging talks on a wide range of unfinished business on Capitol Hill. The shutdown reprieve came as all sides issued optimistic takes on an afternoon White House meeting between top congressional leaders and President Donald Trump.\nThe measure passed the House 235-193, mostly along party lines, and breezed through the Senate on a sweeping 81-14 tally barely an hour later. It would keep the government running through Dec. 22, when another, and more difficult, shutdown problem awaits.\nThe bill now heads to Trump for his signature.\nTopics at the White House session included relief from a budget freeze on the Pentagon and domestic agencies, extending a key children's health program and aid to hurricane-slammed Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida. The trickiest topic, and a top priority for Democrats, involves protections for immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.\nThese \"Dreamer\" immigrants are viewed sympathetically by the public and most lawmakers but face deportation in a few months because Trump reversed administrative protections provided to them by former President Barack Obama.\nPhoto: Alex Brandon, AP Image 1 of / 6 Caption\nClose\nImage 1 of 6 President Donald Trump accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, listens as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., speaks before a meeting with congressional leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017, in Washington. less President Donald Trump accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, listens as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., speaks before a meeting with congressional leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan of ... more Photo: Alex Brandon, AP Image 2 of 6 President Donald Trump speaks before a meeting with congressional leaders including Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017, in Washington. less President Donald Trump speaks before a meeting with congressional leaders including Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., Senate Majority ... more Photo: Alex Brandon, AP Image 3 of 6 House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., left listens with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., and Vice President Mike Pence during a meeting with President Donald Trump and congressional leaders in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017, in Washington. less House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., left listens with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., and Vice President Mike Pence during a meeting with President Donald Trump and congressional leaders in the Oval ... more Photo: Alex Brandon, AP Image 4 of 6 President Donald Trump accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, meets with congressional leaders including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., left, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017, in Washington. less President Donald Trump accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, meets with congressional leaders including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., left, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., Senate Majority ... more Photo: Alex Brandon, AP Image 5 of 6 President Donald Trump accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, speaks before a meeting with congressional leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., left, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017, in Washington. less President Donald Trump accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, speaks before a meeting with congressional leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., left, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., ... more Photo: Alex Brandon, AP Image 6 of 6 President Donald Trump speaks before a meeting with congressional leaders including Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017, in Washington. less President Donald Trump speaks before a meeting with congressional leaders including Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., Senate Majority ... more Photo: Alex Brandon, AP Congress averts shutdown, sends Trump stopgap spending bill 1 / 6 Back to Gallery In back-to-back statements, both Democratic and GOP leaders declared the meeting \"productive.\" The White House called it \"constructive.\" Privately, congressional aides said little progress had been made.\n\"We had a productive conversation on a wide variety of issues. Nothing specific has been agreed to, but discussions continue,\" said Capitol Hill's top Democrats, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, ticking off a roster of Democratic priorities, including domestic spending increases, funding for veterans and money to battle opioid abuse, immigration and health care.\nGOP leaders said they agreed with the need to address immigration, including the almost 1 million immigrants given protections by Obama, many of whom have only known America as their home.\nSpokesmen for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said GOP leaders \"stressed the need to address border security, interior enforcement and other parts of our broken immigration system,\" adding that the tricky immigration issue \"should be a separate process and not used to hold hostage funding for our men and women in uniform.\"\nNegotiations are sure to be challenging. Pelosi staked out a hard line Thursday and insisted that any year-end deal solve the immigration issue.\nPelosi told reporters before the meeting that \"we will not leave here\" without helping the \"Dreamers.\" Her stance was noteworthy because GOP leaders are likely to require Democratic votes for the pre-Christmas spending bill.\nThe White House said \"negotiations on immigration should be held separately on a different track\" and not slow down funding increases for the Pentagon.\nPelosi returned from the White House to oppose Thursday's stopgap bill. Fourteen Democrats supported the measure, however, while 18 Republicans opposed it.\nAmong Republicans, the conservative House Freedom Caucus had resisted the pending stopgap measure earlier in the week, fearing it would lead to a bad deal for conservatives down the road. But on Thursday, the group's chairman, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said the group will likely give leaders whatever support they need to pass the legislation.\nMeadows said they'd help it pass to avoid distractions from the GOP drive to push their treasured $1.5 trillion tax bill through Congress this month. That measure, which mostly benefits businesses and upper-income people, is Trump's and the GOP's top remaining priority and would be their first major legislative triumph of the year.\nBut hours before Trump was to bargain with congressional leaders at the White House over longer-term spending decisions, Meadows said the conservatives would oppose any agreement they feel allows excessive federal spending.\n\"I want to avoid a headline that says President Trump's administration just passes the highest spending levels in U.S. history,\" Meadows told reporters. \"There will be zero support on numbers that are too high, regardless of anybody's position on that.\"\nHe also said Ryan promised he'd fight in coming weeks to pass a full-year budget for the military and leave fights with Democrats over domestic spending for later. It is unclear how that strategy would work, since Republicans control the Senate 52-48 and will need at least eight Democratic votes to pass any spending legislation.\nThe prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\"\nLast week, an unexpected attack by Trump on Schumer and Pelosi prompted the two to skip a bargaining session.\nThe two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children.\nThe CHIP issue is among the year-end items where negotiations have gone positively, and aides say a long-term agreement is nearly in hand.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/70/46/14649774/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/70/46/14649774/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/67/71/25/14652765/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/67/71/25/14652765/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/71/25/14652786/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/67/71/25/14652786/9/920x920.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:47.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a811cf13de87c1a7ed652466982a15982ac073ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7isP1zfmxVBD8z2shoyfpVA4wFVmFnsyV9O_5rfyovk8nVV3Ano_dmdWI_BnQLFv20aHWCT6e2oi3jQ2hmF_wipDsm_oL1RqpnwASl8n9ExSiLY1fr2Tp0", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/more-sports/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "More Sports Board | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Is Clemson considered a dynasty if they go back to back? | Page 5", "title_full": "Is Clemson considered a dynasty if they go back to back? | Page 5 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T04:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "44904bb35382989e1ebe7f1cb04c3f7f10aec9d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7isP1zfmxVBD8z2shoyfpVA4wFVmFnsyV9O_5rfyovk8nVV3Ano_dmdWI_BnQLFv20aHWCT6e2oi3jQ2hmF_wipDsm_oL1RqpnwASl8n9ExSekTNnG.nwVogPFWdh_6jI-", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "EyeTwentyNole", "published": "2017-12-07T04:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "They'll be #1.

X.529/17795\nEven these apparently harmless references to items showing the Armed Man turn out, as explained by Joan Evans, in her study, Magical Jewels of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance particularly in England , to be amulets: \u201cin many instances those [stones] that include figures of armed men confer courage and victory in battle\u201d (p. 49), \u201cfor alectorias, for instance, the sigil of an armed knight and consecration by nine masses is prescribed\u201d (p. 71):\nitem una bossa de vellut carmesi dins la qual ha Ia empremte o ymatge pocha de I. hom qui te una spasa en la ma e un cap tellat en l altre ab un cordo de seda vermeya (p. 491)\n[item a bag of carmine velvet in which is a small impression or image of a man with a sword in one hand and a detached head in the other with a red cord]\n Carved gems for use as amulets, from, Johann Martin von Ebermayer, Capita Deorum et illustrium hominum ... nec non Hieroglyphica, Abraxea et Amuleta qu\u00e6dam, in gemmis antiqua partim, partim recenti manu, affabre incisa (Frankfurt, 1721). 139.g.11.\nThere are nine or so references to \u201cserpents\u2019 teeth\u201d. These were actually prehistoric arrow heads or fossils, and were used to test food for poison. Martin had some mounted on a branching piece of coral, to form what in English we call by the French name of languier :\nitem diversos trosos de branchas d coral ab algunes lengues de serps encastades en argent (p. 528)\n[item various pieces of coral branches with some serpent\u2019s teeth set in silver]\nCoral was used as a teething ring, because it too was thought to have protective powers:\nitem una brancha de coral ab una virolla d argent per a portar a infants (p. 490)\n[item a coral branch with a golden ring for children to wear]\nAnd how could he fail to have:\nitem .I. tros de unicorn encastat en .I.a virolla d aur ab son cordo vermey (p. 541)\n[item a piece of unicorn set in a gold ring with its red cord]\nAs Roca tells us, citing a letter of 1379, unicorn horn too was proof against poison : \u201cla qual val contra ver\u00ed\u201d (p. 54).\n Unicorns, from Pierre Pomet, Histoire ge\u0301ne\u0301rale des Drogues, traitant des plantes, des animaux et des mineraux (Paris, 1694) 37.h.7.\nMartin wasn\u2019t some dark-age wizard who crammed his palace with superstitious rubbish, although he might have been unduly afraid of poisoning. He was also a patron of medical schools in the modern sense, and it\u2019s likely many of these gewgaws were family heirlooms, as they also appear in the inventory of James II (1267-1327), his great grandfather.

In July, his classes jumped to 5 a week, and that\u2019s where the learning began. He also got an acting part in the end of year concert. Heavens above, my poor little life.\nPatience. The crew was not easy at first. Ethan was the only boy in a crew of 6 mostly-Afrikaans, more experienced dancers. And because girls at that age have already begun to grow (the only thing growing about Ethan is his hair), Ethan was also the smallest. The teacher would give instructions during the crew routine, and Ethan wouldn\u2019t respond because he was trying to decipher what had been said, and so the girls would grab him and move him to the said position, and it just about drove him crazy. But in time, they began to know each other, give a little grace to each other, and the teacher would speak in English for Ethan\u2019s sake. There were several times when Ethan got into the car after practice and said, It was great, I really enjoyed it. A few months later, the crew got another boy, now a firm friend!\nAmanda with Revival Crew How to braid hair. Ethan was in the process of growing out his hair. We cut it once, knowing short hair was easier, but he is a pretty determined little thing, so was growing it out again when he got into the crew. So for competition, the long bits on top had to be french plaited. Well, okay, they weren\u2019t really long bits. They were irritating not-long-enough bits that caused untold stress and drama. Thank God for google, and for people who have nothing better to do with their time than post videos of how to french plait. I never got it right first time. He would look like an egg-headed alien if it was too loose, and my being a perfectionist meant any little lump poking up would have to be redone. Thankfully, his pain threshold is very high so he would never complain, and we learned to allocate triple the amount of time necessary so that I wasn\u2019t rushing. Mostly, I got it right on the third time. For one competition, we had to arrive at the venue at 8 a.m. for a sound check, factoring in a one hour drive, so his hair had to be done at the venue, and it wasn\u2019t working, and my hands started shaking, and I thought, This is it, I\u2019m going to have a nervous breakdown over a plait. But somehow, we got it done. We\u2019re all lucky he doesn\u2019t have to wear make-up!\nAll of the hair products. I know them, and I have them. A mother-of-girls friend of mine told me about a liquid slime that sets the hair to not move for a year. Now in my cupboard. And I have a bajillion of the infuriating little black elastics that can be used to tie up tiny man- boy-buns, but they are now on every counter in my house and they drive me crazy. I don\u2019t know why they get everywhere. Maybe it\u2019s because they come in packs of 200, so Ethan has no regard for the concept of re-use. And hairspray covers a multitude of hair wrongs, so hooray for hairspray.\nPlease zoom in to see beautiful hour-long braid. Revival Crew with Coach Mon\u00e9. How to live in the car. Computer for blogging, charger for phone, books, bottles of water and containers of almond nuts have sustained me for many an hour of waiting in the car park. Often, dashing home and trying to get stuff done in the time left before leaving to collect him again is more stressful than just resigning myself to the fact that I have an hour to kill. Honestly, I sometimes looked forward to the hour of solace. However, sometimes this happened: There are those who know. Moms around me have kids who have danced since they could walk, and this is all \u2018old hat\u2019 to them. So I sit close by and ask away. How do you deal with nerves? (Not your child\u2019s, your own. It turns out, after the first competition, the kids don\u2019t get nervous anymore. But the moms still forget to breathe during a performance.) How long will this day of qualifiers be? (Aaaa day.) Should my husband come to these all-day things? (No. Definitely not.) Should he come to the end-of-year concert thing? (Yes. It\u2019s totally different to a competition, it\u2019s a show, and it\u2019s beautiful.) Why do I have to pay to get in to watch the competition? (Because if your child dances, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re royalty. They still have to make money, and life\u2019s not fair, so pay up.)\n \nCrew \u201cnerd\u201d dress-up Crew \u201cdress-up\u201d fun Balls will be dropped, and I\u2019m still not perfect. My fridge is covered in highlighted schedules and scripts, and my phone pings all day with whatsapp group messages. But I still had the heart-stopping experience of looking at my phone when I was at the supermarket, and the text said, \u201cIs Ethan nearly here?\u201d And no, Ethan is not nearly there. Ethan is at home, probably watching TV with his brothers, oblivious to his schedule which wreaks havoc on his mother\u2019s brain. So the half-full trolley is abandoned, the child is transported via flying mom-wagon to his lesson, arriving a little late, and this little mommy goes wee-wee-wee crying all the way home, so annoyed that she got it wrong. And the next week, another mom gets the same message about her child, because who the heck could remember all those days and times anyway?\nMy child has unexpected confidence. This became clearly evident on the weekend of the Provincial competition in Camps Bay this weekend. In addition to the crews, there are \u201cbattles\u201d which bore everyone to tears, because they take so long, and it\u2019s usually not your kid dancing, so the parents zone out, and seek coffee. Each age group has individuals enter who are then paired up to \u2018battle\u2019 each other, whittling down to the final two to get the winner. Knowing how long the battles take, I went outside to get some fresh air, stretch and un-numb my bum. A few minutes later, another mom called me and said, \u201c Lea! I think Ethan is doing the battle just now! They were just sorting out an entry number for him.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?!\u201d I say. What the bloody hell is he doing , I think. Sure enough, the tiny 12 year old is in the 12 to 16 year age group, gets selected for a battle, and ends up 4th. My heart was beating so hard, I could hardly breathe, and I forgot to press record on the video. Terrifying.\n\nHow to balance the instruction and encouragement. Blowing kisses as he walks off stage strikes me as arrogant, but he\u2019s perhaps just enjoying the moment. He\u2019ll get home soon, where he is constantly fighting for his place in the spotlight with 3 older louts, so I may just let that go. There is a weird grey area between confidence (aka pride? arrogance?) and humility, and to some extent, the two can co-exist, but it\u2019s a hard balance. These are all new lessons I\u2019m trying to figure out\u2026to be watchful against pride (both his and ours), to encourage through the disappointments\u2026 but not so much that it\u2019s unrealistic ( don\u2019t worry, Ethie, you\u2019ll get gold next time, I\u2019m sure. Duh\u2026) to push when they become lazy or apathetic, to make sure they don\u2019t stop receiving instruction / correction, and that all hard work will lead to better results, no matter the sacrifice of long hours and effort.\nWhen pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom. Proverbs 11:2\nThe emotions. In Ethan\u2019s first competition, Heath was on my right, and Luke and Aiden on my left in the audience. As Ethan begins his routine, Luke and Aiden, wide-eyed with surprise, laugh out loud and say, Hey! He can really dance! Throughout the routine, I find myself wanting to burst into tears, instead I dig my nails into Heath\u2019s leg and inhale sharply every time they get through a trick or sequence. This results in being fit to burst at the end, and I clap and scream, now wanting to laugh hysterically instead of cry, because they didn\u2019t fall over, and it was exhilarating for this no-rhythm-white-chick-who-can\u2019t-dance to watch.\nRevival took home the bronze medal in the HHI World Qualifier Junior section, Camps Bay, Sat 2nd Dec, 2017. Woo Hoo & Hallelujah!! Long may the dancing lessons (his\u2026and mine) continue!\n \nMay the lessons learned in the quiet or the chaos lead you closer to Him.\nLea.\n\u201cWhatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might\u2026\u201d Ecclesiastes 9:10\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aiden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mon\u00e9", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amanda klotz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "god", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amanda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heath", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gift of dance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hairspray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "camps bay", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:49.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "00a504ef35b89563c8609894147d20e35fb46897", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkHNIPNVgsKzDbKpciiQPRiYP8cncFCrXAp89JXc_hCTDyScTixUfHvdT26TRt9NPj.rX.mMCVdSQs4PTxuoIS9W2XLl3JpLiwuPjZdUhlfBAvVwXorpG2MaE0W8J45j.XsjU4lXe3hEmWjpR0jQgLvSeqImpvVLo-", "site_full": "community.ebay.com", "site": "ebay.com", "site_section": "https://community.ebay.com/t5/Shipping-Returns/bd-p/shipping-returns-db?q=_change_me_", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Shipping &amp;

On a footpath that can be very dangerous to both pedestrians and cyclists.\nThere is no order on a footpath - pedestrians don't have/need lanes or rules. That makes pedestrians rather unpredictable. They can stop whenever, turn and change direction whenever, move to whichever side of the footpath whenever, walk out of a building whenever. This isn't an issue at walking speeds, because at those speeds everyone has time to react, but at cycling speeds it is.\nI'm not a cyclist, but I personally don't want them on the footpaths. The footpath is a safe space for a pedestrian - you can walk along it without the fear of getting hit by some fast moving object.\nI do think laws and infrastructure need to be improved though, and most of all - the attitude of ALL users on the road.

(PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nBodkin Design & Engineering has custom-engineered a blackbody infrared radiance standard for Marvin Test Solutions, to integrate into their modular target simulators. The blackbody unit supplied by BD&E is a derivative of their MRDT-50 infrared calibrator product, originally developed to calibrate infrared tracking cameras at White Sands missile range. \nMarvin Test Solutions incorporates the device into its MTS-916 series of Modular Target Simulators. The MTS-916 is part of a suite of armament and munitions test solutions that support the testing and verification of optically-guided weapon systems such as Maverick or Hellfire missiles. The testing of optically-guided weapons is complex, and a complete test solution requires a device such as the MTS-916 to simulate either a stationary or moving target. Target simulation ensures that the optical seeker can track and terminally guide the weapon to the target. \n\u201cBodkin Design and Engineering is a valued supplier that we know we can depend on for OEM components and subassemblies that meet our most demanding requirements,\u201d said Lowell Parsons, Director of Test Engineering for Marvin Test Solutions. \u201cTheir focus on quality and customer support enables us to continue delivering the advanced mil/aero test solutions our customers need.\u201d \nBodkin Design & Engineering has recently been working with MassMEP, a resource committed to manufacturing growth in the state of Massachusetts, to grow their OEM business profile. The Company considers this particular opportunity a stepping stone to success in increasing their manufacturing capabilities, as well as helping the state to reach their goals. \nAbout Bodkin Design & Engineering Visit us at Photonics West, booth #2610, from January 30 \u2013 February 1, 2018 at the Moscone Center in San Fransisco. \nBodkin Design and Engineering, LLC has been providing electro-optic engineering and custom manufacturing as well as test and R&D services since 2003.

While there could be many reasons why this is the case - such as the lack of a formal ideation management framework or your personal inability to get the attention of key decision-makers - let us look at this challenge from the perspective of a particular leadership concept, the so-called Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) theory.\nLMX puts emphasis on the interaction process and dyadic relationship between leaders and followers. First conceived by US academics Fred Dansereau, George Bear Graen and William J. Haga, it draws attention on the existence of in-groups and out-groups within organisations and how that may affect organisational outcomes related to performance, job climate, organisational citizenship behaviour or innovation.\nWhile members of in-groups are often regarded as \"good\" organisational citizens who are doing more than their job specs require, out-group members engage in business as usual as stipulated by their job contracts. They get less attention from their leaders and, over time, often turn out to be less engaged.\nBecoming part of the in-group is based to some extent on the quality of the relationship between boss and subordinate. Supporting a leader through mission-critical project works, for example, can be instrumental in becoming part of the leader's \"inner circle\". If the quality is high, in-group members may benefit in terms of favourable performance evaluations or faster career progress, which in turn might lead to greater organisational commitment.\nLMX research posits that in-group members receive more information and concern from their leaders, which correlates with greater involvement and extra-role taking. As time progresses and roles become more formalised, a supportive staff member may advance into a powerful position. The flipside is that subordinates in the out-group may feel less recognised. They receive less attention from the boss due to the comparatively low quality of their relationship.\nWhile \"negotiating\" with the leader may help to make an individual part of the (seemingly more privileged) in-group, in reality, the pathway towards a high-quality leader-member exchange might be blocked for those categorised as out-group members due to insufficient opportunities to interact with the boss, or simply because the leader does not know how to manage the \"leadership making process\". The number of bosses who really make time to get to know employees and to create a deeper relationship beyond town hall events or routine staff meetings is still rather small, despite decades of leadership development research and training. The peak of the leadership making process is a \"mature\" partnership phase characterised by a high degree of mutual trust and respect, and responsibility that transcends traditional hierarchy.\nWhile LMX is a rather \"old\" theory with some inconsistencies (such as its measurement validity), the core concept does provide valuable insights into \"good\" leadership principles, such as the need to be more responsive to followers' requests for participation or the importance of being mindful in allocating newly created, interesting job opportunities to the \"right\" candidate(s), regardless of any potential ingroup-outgroup bias.\nSIX BUILDING BLOCKS\nThe conceptual heritage of LMX is visible in more recent, both prescriptive and diagnostic innovation management frameworks such as the innovation assessment tool \"How Innovative Is Your Company's Culture?\" by Jay Rao and Joseph Weintraub.\nRelevant items of the building block \"Leadership Behaviour\" (one of six building blocks of a robust innovation culture) include \"Our leaders inspire us with a vision for the future and articulation of opportunities for the organisation\", \"Our leaders model the right innovation behaviours for others to follow\" or \"Our leaders provide support to project team members during both successes and failures\".\nInnovation leaders are well advised to \"energise\", \"engage\" and \"enable\" followers in order to make the organisation more innovative and to avoid what innovation expert Scott Anthony has termed \"innovation inbreeding\". This can happen when innovation efforts are consistently led by the same group of people.\nResearch has shown that major inventions often occur in the \"wrong place\", for example, by people in out-groups. To avoid innovation inbreeding, leaders can bring in external ideas in order to innovate the firm's business model, initiate co-creation of new products and services together with customers or establish internal innovation jams to leverage on diverse talent pools. Related management instruments are so-called skunkworks project teams led independently of normal research and development operations.\nSo what could you do if you belong to an out-group in your organisation with little or no influence on innovation matters? Don't accept the ingroup-outgroup dichotomy as a given. Attempt to change it.\nArrange for your own personal \"meet-the-boss session\" and voice your concerns and innovative ideas. Take the initiative and open up so that the boss can learn more about you (personality compatibilities have been identified as potential drivers of a hi-quality dyad relationship between a leader and follower) and vice-versa.\nJust like subordinates, bosses also need cooperation, reliability and honesty. Try to figure out what may impede or facilitate effective communication, and act on that insight. By taking responsibility for improving the relationship between leader and follower, problems can be removed so that both parties can play a more constructive role in making innovation work.\nThe writer is professor of organisational behaviour and human resources at the Lee Kong Chian School of Business at Singapore Management University (SMU), and academic director of SMU's Master of Science in Innovation programme", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "george bear graen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred dansereau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott anthony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william j. haga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay rao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph weintraub", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lmx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee kong chian school of business at singapore management university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:51.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa061dc03c1afc68def80913ba46e5a688ccc521", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBIpEu4AXCvIlVc5odxwEYoUMlZEfuXublD3SqWzbxXmEsOPcX9FI.Ha6op5gX_EYeSLFSH_i0SBk2", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/share-chat.asp?page=138", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Share Chat on London South East.

Jeff Siner Save \nIn November, special attention was given to those who set aside their needs and time in order to provide for relatives as Indiana celebrated family caregivers during National Family Caregivers Month. \n\u201cAs chairman of the Health and Provider Services Committee in the Indiana State Senate, I have seen the difference that family caregiving makes in the lives of older and disabled Hoosiers,\u201d said Senator Ed Charbonneau. \u201cThanks to organizations like Caregiver Homes, friends and family members receive the support necessary to provide quality personal care on a daily basis. I\u2019m happy to recognize family caregivers across our state for the tireless work they do in Indiana communities.\u201d \nIn 1994, the National Family Caregivers Association began promoting family caregivers which led to the first Presidential Proclamation being signed in 1997 by then President Bill Clinton. The proclamation recognized family caregivers across the country each November and every President since has followed suit in honoring these selfless men and women who refuse to let a family member in need continue on alone. \nIt takes a special breed to be a caregiver, someone who devotes their time to assist others who simply cannot live with the independence many of us take for advantage. Be it the elderly, disabled, the ill or those with a mental disorder, caregivers provide a helping hand every step of the day. Getting people through the difficult and also the mundane. \nBeing a family caregiver can add weighted pressure as often there is a personal connection between the caregiver and the person they are caring for, be it through blood or marriage. By providing this service, however, these family caregivers allow their relative to remain in their home and potentially live the last day's of their life under a roof they're familiar with. \n\u201cNational Family Caregivers Month is a time for us to continue to acknowledge the hard work of caregivers across the state,\u201d said Caregiver Homes of Indiana State Director Jennifer Trowbridge. \u201cNinety percent of people prefer to age in place and with the help of the amazing family caregivers across the state, this is a reality for so many Hoosiers.\u201d \nCaregiver Homes of Indiana is a division of Seniorlink and provides an intensive, in-model of care known as Structured Family Caregiving. They have grown rapidly over the state of Indiana and now serve over 1,500 people across the state, including having family caregivers in La Porte. \nCaregivers are most often family members, but anyone willing to live with the eligible individual and provide care is a potential match. A caregiver under this program should be available to provide 24-hour care as needed, and will receive a tax free twice-monthly stipend, as well as training and guidance from registered nurses and care managers from Caregiver Homes. \n\"The entire Caregiver Homes team is so kind and does a great job,\" said one La Porte-based caregiver. \"They checked in when my father-in-law was in the hospital and continue to support me in caring for my mother-in-law. I hope other families learn about this service as well because I am blessed to have them assist me.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt christy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff siner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed charbonneau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saundra adams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee adams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer trowbridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clinton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "caregiver homes of indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana state senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caregiver homes of indiana state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national family caregivers association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "health and provider services committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la porte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.c.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:06:52.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d5dd52772e5d78309441381c0bb2af17c7fe5a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPWMPXTCyUmLtcUePm31ewpvzKvWj9vaqloZsbW3y9NjMgmNEXvBsnXO.mI9.mvaCfAayeJi2e.V3O2THcSVhJv6gh0TaQy8sFaNVWdzQlBL15Ap0H3amewbXK9Ul9LVE7Q--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g294211-i642-China.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "China Forum, Travel Discussion for China - TripAdvisor", "title": "Hong Kong average night Price for family accommodation - Hong Kong", "title_full": "Hong Kong average night Price for family accommodation - Hong Kong Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-07T06:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f3d673570a0a5915200df5d168e12711af6c2fcc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPWMPXTCyUmLtcUePm31ewpvzKvWj9vaqloZsbW3y9NjMgmNEXvBsnXO.mI9.mvaCfAayeJi2e.V3O2THcSVhJv6gh0TaQy8sFaNVWdzQlBL15Ap0H3amewYsJ0eOQvBmw0NAGtV0w6tA", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "kegler747", "published": "2017-12-07T07:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "There are also many hotels offering interconnecting rooms like Holiday Inn Golden Mile in TST.
