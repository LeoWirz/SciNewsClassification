VE303 is the first known investigational drug consisting of a rationally-defined bacterial consortium in powder form to enter the clinic. Vedanta also today announced that VE303 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \n\n\u201cThe initiation of this study marks an important milestone for both Vedanta Biosciences and the microbiome field, as we\u2019ve been able to advance a new class of drugs to the clinic,\u201d said Bernat Olle, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Vedanta Biosciences. \u201cFirst-generation approaches in the microbiome field have relied on uncharacterized fecal material or spore fractions of fecal material, which are inherently inconsistent procedures. Products with a rationally-defined composition are the next logical step in the evolution of the microbiome field. We believe VE303 is the first rationally-defined bacterial consortium in powder form to advance into the clinic in any indication, and we plan to rapidly advance two additional programs into clinical development in 2018.\u201d \nVE303 is an orally-administered investigational microbiome therapeutic consisting of live bacteria designed to restore colonization resistance against gut pathogens, including C. difficile , following recurrence. The Phase 1a/1b, dose-escalating study will assess the safety, tolerability, and colonization of VE303 in healthy volunteers, and will enroll approximately 30 subjects. The primary outcome of the study is the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of VE303, and secondary outcomes include the kinetics of intestinal colonization by the bacteria in VE303. The study is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018. Pending the results of this study, Vedanta plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial in rCDI in 2018. \nVE303 has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Orphan Drug Designation is a status given to drugs and biologics that are intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers C. difficile infections one of the most urgent bacterial threats. C. difficile infections account for 15,000 deaths each year in the U.S. alone. Existing interventions for C. difficile infections include antibiotics, which have the undesirable side effect of damaging the gut microbiome, leaving patients vulnerable to re-infection and building resistance to antibiotics. Microbiome-based therapies offer an alternative to antibiotics that could address both of these problems at once. \nAbout VE303 \nVE303 is an orally-administered investigational microbiome therapeutic. It is produced from pure, clonal cell banks, which yield a standardized drug product in powder form and bypass the need to rely on direct sourcing of fecal donor material of inconsistent composition. It consists of a defined consortium of live bacteria designed to restore colonization resistance against gut pathogens, including C. difficile . VE303 was generated using Vedanta\u2019s proprietary discovery platform, which leverages what is believed to be the largest collection of human microbiome-associated bacterial strains, and is manufactured in-house at Vedanta\u2019s state-of-the-art, cGMP-compliant facilities. \nIn November 2017, the VE303 program received a grant of up to $5.4 million from CARB-X (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator), a global public-private partnership focused on funding the development of promising new antibacterial products and rapid diagnostics. This was CARB-X\u2019s first award announced for a microbiome project and also the first for a project targeting C. difficile . \nAbout Vedanta Biosciences \nVedanta Biosciences is pioneering development of a new category of therapies for immune-mediated and infectious diseases based on rationally designed consortia of bacteria derived from the human microbiome. An affiliate of PureTech Health (PureTech Health plc, PRTC.L), Vedanta\u2019s founding team includes a group of world-renowned experts in immunology and microbiology. Vedanta Biosciences is a leader in the microbiome field with capabilities and deep expertise to discover, develop and manufacture drugs based on live bacterial consortia. The Company\u2019s facilities include integrated manufacturing operations providing cGMP-compliant manufacturing of rationally-designed bacterial consortia in powder form. Leveraging its proprietary technology platform and the expertise of its team of scientific co-founders, Vedanta Biosciences has isolated and maintains the largest collection of human microbiome-associated bacterial strains and has characterized, in collaborations with leading experts, how the immune system recognizes and responds to these microbes. This pioneering work has led to the identification of human commensal bacteria that induce a range of immune responses \u2013 including induction of regulatory T cells, CD8+ T cells, and Th17 cells, among others \u2013 as well as the characterization of novel molecular mechanisms of microbial-host communication. These advances have been published in leading peer-reviewed journals including Science (multiple) , Nature ( multiple ) , Cell and Nature Immunology . Vedanta Biosciences has harnessed these biological insights, its proprietary library of microbiome-derived bacterial strains, as well as data from clinical translational collaborations, to generate a pipeline of programs addressing infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, inflammation and immune-oncology indications. \nVedanta Biosciences\u2019 scientific co-founders have pioneered the fields of innate immunity, Th17 and regulatory T cell biology, and include Dr. Ruslan Medzhitov (Professor of Immunobiology at Yale), Dr. Alexander Rudensky (tri-institutional Professor at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Institute, the Rockefeller University and Cornell University), Dr. Dan Littman (Professor of Molecular Immunology at NYU), Dr. Brett Finlay (Professor at the University of British Columbia) and Dr. Kenya Honda (Professor, Keio University School of Medicine). Vedanta is backed by Seventure, Invesco Asset Management, and Rock Springs Capital and has collaborations with leading institutions including Janssen Biotech, Inc., NYU Langone Health and its Perlmutter Cancer Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, Leiden University Medical Center, University of Tokyo, Keio University, RIKEN, and the University of South Alabama Mitchell Cancer Institute. \nContacts PureTech Health \nAllison Mead Talbot, +1 617-651-3156\namt@puretechhealth.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "allison mead talbot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander rudensky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya honda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruslan medzhitov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernat olle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seventure", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brett finlay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan littman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "prtc", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "vedanta biosciences", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "puretech health", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "lse", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puretech health plc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keio university school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keio university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyu langone health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janssen biotech, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "invesco asset management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of south alabama mitchell cancer institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perlmutter cancer center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rock springs capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cornell university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vedanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antibiotic resistant bacteria biopharmaceutical accelerator", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leiden university medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vedanta biosciences  vedanta biosciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford university school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rockefeller university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mass.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vedanta", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:36.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e33761b27e1fea742fd9e26bc3f9ed259e8b5e4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8WGXsp_Rv3kuxvj4BAel5qZssbl.qjT694fbU6unXKVeKI3oDD4zT7bjGhuTuEbETxeRtF21WGZhy2ZGC786GCxEig_HyjzJs-", "site_full": "www.mvtimes.com", "site": "mvtimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.mvtimes.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Martha's Vineyard Times", "title": "MVRHS budget approval stalled by state rule", "title_full": "MVRHS budget approval stalled by state rule", "published": "2017-12-06T21:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e33761b27e1fea742fd9e26bc3f9ed259e8b5e4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8WGXsp_Rv3kuxvj4BAel5qZssbl.qjT694fbU6unXKVeKI3oDD4zT7bjGhuTuEbETxeRtF21WGZhy2ZGC786GCxEig_HyjzJs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jack Shea", "published": "2017-12-06T21:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "MVRHS budget approval stalled by state rule", "text": "Home News MVRHS budget approval stalled by state rule MVRHS budget approval stalled by state rule Full committee vote is required. By 0 \nA final vote on approval of the fiscal year 2019 Martha\u2019s Vineyard Regional High School (MVRHS) operating budget on Monday night was postponed because the required number of school committee members were not in attendance. The committee will take up budget certification again at its Dec. 11 meeting at 4:30 pm. \nThe school committee is arranging another meeting to comply with state regulations, which require every member of a school committee to vote on budgets. While the school committee had a quorum for the meeting, only seven of the nine-member board attended Monday night\u2019s meeting in the MVRHS library meeting room. \nAfter members present voted 5-1-1 in favor of the budget, board member Jeffrey S. (Skipper) Manter reminded the meeting of the state law requirement. Mr. Manter of West Tisbury cast the lone dissenting vote. New Oak Bluffs representative Kathryn Shertzer, attending her first MVRHS school committee meeting, abstained from the vote. Ms. Shertzer replaces Michael Hoyt, who left the committee recently. \nThe school committee made only one change to the budget, transferring a project to replace coolers in the school\u2019s cafeteria and culinary area from the excess and deficiencies (E&D) account to a line item in the operating budget. \nThat move added $43,377.21, to increase the final budget to $21.2 million. The committee moved E&D funds earmarked and available for the project, and will not increase the amount of funds needed to be raised for the budget. \nState law requires regional school districts to maintain an excess and deficiency (E&D) account. In cities or towns, this fund is referred to as Free Cash, and in private business is similar to retained earnings. At the end of every fiscal year, any surplus or deficit in the district\u2019s general fund goes into the unreserved fund balance, referred to as the excess and deficiency (E&D) fund. \nThe proposed budget, which has undergone six iterations and reviews, is 7.36 percent higher than than the FY 2018 operating budget. About 6 percent of the 7.36 percent relates to contractual obligations of pay raises, a 15 percent increase in health insurance premiums, and contributions to retired employee benefits and pension obligations. \nOn a line-by-line comparison, the budget is 1.76 percent greater than the current year. MVRHS Principal Sara Dingledy last week described the budget as a \u201dresponsible, sustainable, and accurate reflection of school costs.\u201d \nMr. Manter, a noted fiscal conservative, applauded the administration\u2019s effort to reduce electricity costs by $44,000 as a result of green energy initiatives. \u201cOften people say they\u2019re going to do something, and that\u2019s the last you hear, but you followed through,\u201d he said. \nThe board agreed to begin revisiting the existing regional agreement between the high school and the six Island towns. The agreement has been in place since 1994. Amy Houghton, meeting chairman, said the \u201cshared costs and allocations may be outdated or not relevant now. We can take a look at all the allocations,\u201d she said. \nMs. Houghton envisioned the review being completed in time for 2020 annual town meetings. \u201cMy town has asked me to do this, and we should do it now so we have time enough to make thoughtful changes and time to work through this, and in time for towns to plan warrant articles for 2020 town meetings,\u201d she said \nAfter a short discussion, the committee agreed that the entire committee rather than a subcommittee would undertake the review, probably after the new year. \nIn other business, the MVRHS student report noted that a Capture the Flag tournament, spearheaded by junior Colin Henke, raised $400 from the school community that will go toward breast cancer awareness. \nThe committee also heard an update from student representatives of SWEAR (Stand With Everyone Against Rape) who attended a one-day seminar on the subject, and are delivering the message to classmates at MVRHS. Lizzie Williamson, Gabe Nelson, Joao Goncalves, Dillon McAndrews, and Ian Trance, in collaboration with Connect to End Violence, have met with freshmen and sophomore health classes to discuss healthy relationships and consent.

The House passed its version on Nov. 16, the Senate in the early hours of Dec. 2. They held no hearings of any consequence. Most senators did not even have time to read the final Senate version at 500 pages before the 2 am vote. \nFor now, a House/Senate conference committee is working behind closed doors on cleaning up the differences between the two bills. Still, six things are clear. \nFirst, the package has a potential negative impact on the national debt, according to many economists, who say that it would ordinarily rise to $30 trillion by 2027. Now, that figure will increase by an additional $1.5 trillion. Even the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, which uses a Republican-favored growth formula, estimated the total increase will reach $31 trillion in a decade. Gone is the long-held Republican principle of balanced budgets and fiscal responsibility. \nRepublicans argue that the reduction in the corporate tax from 35 to 20 percent will lead to greater business investment, higher wages, and more jobs. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, there is \u201clittle evidence that tax cuts boost economic activity.\u201d Corporations are already holding record amounts of cash and not spending it: Bloomberg Markets estimates that amount at $2.3 trillion. And the unemployment rate stands at 4.1 percent, in decline since 2010. \nIf the debt grows because of little or no growth in the economy, a trigger to increase revenue will come in the 2010 Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act, colloquially known as Paygo. It automatically cuts some 228 mandatory spending programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, though Social Security is currently exempt. Republicans have long wanted to privatize Medicare and Social Security: This may well be their next agenda item. \nSecond, both bills eliminate the deduction for state and local taxes, but maintain a property tax deduction for up to $10,000. According to the New York Times, last year some 40 million households deducted $350 billion in state and local taxes, while 38 million did so for $200 billion in property taxes. Most economists have pointed out that this change will mostly affect states along the East and West Coasts, including Massachusetts. \nThe House bill also reduces the mortgage interest deduction for homeowners with up to $500,000 in loans. \nThird, it is difficult to determine with certainty who will receive tax cuts or increases. According to usa.com , a statistics research firm, the median household income of residents in the Martha\u2019s Vineyard School District is $65,800. The median is the number in the middle, so that 50 percent of households are higher, 50 percent lower. \nA New York Times survey estimates that about three-quarters of families earning $65,800 will receive a tax cut of about $850 per year, or about $70 per month. Some 11 percent would receive a tax increase. Those in the top 0.1 percent, with incomes over $3.6 million, will see an annual average income tax cut of $85,640, or $7,137 per month. \nOn Nov. 29, the president said, \u201cThis [bill] is going to cost me a fortune, this thing, believe me. This is not good for me.\u201d The Washington Post, however, estimated that Mr. Trump could save between $9 and $16 million a year, because most of his income comes through the 500 pass-through businesses he owns, which requires him to pay personal income taxes on their revenues. Precise figures of how much money he may save are unknown because he has declined to release his income tax returns. \nBoth bills reduce the tax rate, grant a more generous child credit, and double the standard deduction. In any event, all personal tax cuts expire in 2025 in the Senate version, so taxes will increase for everyone. In the House bill, they do not expire. In any case, both versions make permanent the reduction of the corporate income tax from 35 to 20 percent. \nFourth, a few eliminations. The House bill eliminates the alternative minimum tax for corporations and individuals, but the Senate bill maintains it for corporations. \nTeachers and principals who shell out money from their own pockets to help their students with supplies, food, and other things may no longer get a small, though welcome, tax deduction on the first $250 they spend. The House bill eliminates it. The Senate counterpart raises the deduction to the first $500. \nIn addition, students in graduate and professional school may have to pay taxes on tuition waivers their universities award them. That is part of the House bill. \nThe Senate bill eradicates the individual mandate embedded in the Affordable Care Act. The House bill does not as yet, but House leaders say they will back the Senate plan. Getting rid of the mandate has long been a Republican goal to repeal Obamacare. The Congressional Budget Office announced that without the mandate, the government would save around $338 billion over 10 years in insurance subsidies for poor people. At the same time, by 2027, 13 million people would lose their health insurance. Those with health insurance may see a 10 percent rise in their premiums beyond expected increases. \nAt the same time, the House bill eliminates the estate tax entirely, while the Senate version does so partially, raising the minimum tax-free inheritance to $11 million for an individual, $22 million for a couple. If the final version abolishes the estate tax, as President Trump long ago demanded as a candidate, beneficiaries will be the wealthiest Americans. The Trump children \u2014 Ivanka, Eric, and Donald Jr. \u2014 stand to do quite well. \nFifth, the bills reduce the number of tax categories from seven to four to simplify the process, and double the standard deduction Americans claim when filing their returns. The House bill increases the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1,600 per child; the Senate raises it to $2,000 per child. \nSixth, both versions contain some controversial changes unrelated to taxes. For example, the House bill repeals the 1954 Johnson Amendment, which prohibits religious institutions from advocating political candidates, and the Senate bill opens the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. \nWhat then is the potential impact of this legislation on Islanders? According to a mid-November Quinnipiac poll, 61 percent of Americans agreed that the proposals enriched the wealthy, not the middle or poorer classes. Fifty-two percent said the reform package would have no impact on jobs or economic growth. Just 25 percent supported the package, and only 16 percent agreed that their taxes would be lower. \nThis bill is simply politics, not policy. The president and Republicans, who control both houses of Congress, need a major legislative victory. They have not had one since they took office in January. What matters to them is to show their donors they support them as the 2018 election looms on the horizon. What matters to us is whether we understand just what this package is all about, and why Republicans want to push it so quickly to the president\u2019s desk. \n\nJack Fruchtman, a seasonal Aquinnah resident, teaches constitutional law and politics at Maryland\u2019s Towson University.

By 5 Antone Silvia died from a fentanyl overdose. Investigators say he died shortly after purchasing the lethal drug. \nThe mother of overdose victim Antone Silvia is seeking justice for her son, taking the opioid epidemic and the supply of drugs head-on. \nBrenda Williston-Floyd filed a criminal complaint against the man police say allegedly sold her son a lethal dose of heroin laced with fentanyl. A clerk magistrate issued the complaint for a manslaughter charge, and Aaron Bezahler, 22, of Edgartown, is scheduled to be arraigned Dec. 14 in Edgartown District Court, just four days before his trial is set to begin on related drug charges. \nCape and Islands District Attorney Michael O\u2019Keefe\u2019s office did not pursue the manslaughter charge, despite evidence collected by the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Drug Task Force that showed the Tisbury man died shortly after purchasing the drugs. \nMr. Silvia, 26, died from a drug overdose \u2014 acute fentanyl poisoning, to be specific, but Ms. Williston-Floyd believes the evidence is overwhelming that her son thought he was injecting himself with a dose of heroin he could tolerate, according to court records. \n\u201cAs a parent, I feel that these drug dealers need to be held accountable and serve prison time for what they are doing to our children. I realize that the drug dealers may not be forcing their drugs upon people, but in a sense with this sickness, the intense effects of withdrawals force our young people to seek out these dealers,\u201d Ms. Williston-Floyd wrote in a letter to The Times. \u201cI strongly believe that if a drug dealer sells something that takes a life, they should be held accountable.\u201d \nAttorney Jennifer Marcus, who is representing Mr. Bezahler in the drug case, told The Times the facts don\u2019t support a manslaughter charge. \n\u201cI understand how she feels. I\u2019m sympathetic to it. We all are,\u201d Ms. Marcus said. \u201cThe police and DA\u2019s office chose not to pursue this as a homicide. So they are in a position now of having to reevaluate that. That decision they made, they made for a reason, based on the facts of the case.\u201d \nMr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s office declined to answer specific questions about the case. \u201cThe matter has been under investigation since April of 2017. Massachusetts State Police detectives assigned to the District Attorney\u2019s office have been working together with the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Drug Task Force and other local law enforcement to investigate and gather evidence,\u201d Tara Miltimore, a spokeswoman for the DA\u2019s office, wrote in an email. \u201cSince there is a pending court matter, it would be inappropriate to comment any further.\u201d \nMs. Williston-Floyd sought the manslaughter charge herself after learning that evidence gathered by the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Drug Task Force traced the deadly fentanyl back to Mr. Bezahler. Clerk magistrate Charles J. Ardito III, the Barnstable District Court clerk, brought the complaint forward based on the facts presented in statements. Mr. Ardito ruled on the case because Edgartown District Court magistrate Liza Williamson recused herself, citing her personal knowledge of the Silvia family, according to court documents. \n\u201cMr. Bezahler\u2019s negligence [led] to my son\u2019s death,\u201d Williston-Floyd wrote in her application for a complaint. \u201cHe was not honest with Antone and sold him heroin laced with fentanyl.\u201d \nIn her letter to The Times, Ms. Williston-Floyd, wrote, \u201cI recently lost my son to an awful drug out there that is killing our kids. Opioid addiction is an epidemic which is growing in our towns and taking the lives of our young people. With that being said, fentanyl is a powerful pain-relieving substance, and most people are not educated on what the substance can actually do to a person if not prescribed with the proper dosage. With an opioid addiction our family, friends, neighbors, etc., are getting drawn in and self-medicating with these drugs, until they unknowingly use a different substance which ultimately ends their life.\u201d \nAn autopsy report that accompanied the application for a criminal complaint shows the level of fentanyl was 13 nanograms per milliliter. Fentanyl is a more powerful drug than heroin. \u201cSo by Antone thinking he was taking heroin, he gave himself a dosage that he knew he could handle. Since what he was given was fentanyl, it ended up being a lethal dose,\u201d she wrote in the application for a criminal complaint. \nMr. Bezahler is scheduled for a jury trial starting Dec. 18 on charges of distribution of a Class A drug (heroin) and conspiracy to violate the drug laws. Aaron Bezahler, 22, is facing a manslaughter charge in the death of Antone Silvia. \nJudge Thomas Kirkman has already ruled that statements made by Mr. Bezahler to police can be introduced at the trial, but has not yet acted on a motion filed Dec. 1 by Mr. Bezahler\u2019s attorney, which seeks to keep any mention of Mr. Silvia\u2019s death out of his trial. \u201cEvidence relating to Antone Silvia\u2019s death is both irrelevant and immaterial to the charges of distribution and conspiracy, and unfairly prejudicial,\u201d attorney Marcus wrote. \u201cThe only purpose of admitting such disturbing evidence would be to arouse emotion and improperly inflame the jury.\u201d \nIn his statement to police, Mr. Bezahler talks about Mr. Silvia\u2019s death. \u201cI\u2019m getting blamed for someone\u2019s [expletive] death,\u201d he is quoted as telling the officer. \n\u201cWell, at the end of the day you got to take a little bit of responsibility,\u201d the officer is quoted as saying. \n\u201cYes. You\u2019re right,\u201d Mr. Bezahler replied. \nIn her motion to exclude mention of Mr. Silvia\u2019s death, Ms. Marcus points out in her motion that the DA\u2019s office isn\u2019t seeking charges in the death. \u201cThe death in this case was deemed to have occurred three days after the alleged drug transaction, and the defendant has not been charged with homicide,\u201d she wrote. \nMr. Silvia\u2019s body was found April 23 at his Tisbury home after a friend called police, saying she had not heard from him in three days. \nAccording to the police report written by Edgartown Det. Michael Snowden, Mr. Silvia was found in the bathroom floor with a spoon with a white substance on it next to him, and a uncapped syringe in his right hand. A timeline of witnesses and text messages shows the last person having contact with Mr. Silvia was Mr. Bezahler, through text messages that indicated a drug transaction had taken place between the two men. \nMr. Silvia had made plans to meet up with a woman on April 20 at 7:30 pm, but he never showed. He did not answer any calls or text messages from her, according to the police report. He also didn\u2019t show up for work on April 21, the records show. \nAfter inadvertently viewing the text conversation between Mr. Bezahler and Mr. Silvia, the officers applied for and received a search warrant to go through the phone. The last message Mr. Bezahler opened was three days before his body was found at 5:56 pm, the records show. \u201cAccording to Antone\u2019s phone, Antone never opened a message or texted another person again,\u201d the report states. \nThe report includes 47 text messages made between Mr. Bezahler and Mr. Silvia on April 20. \u201cThe text messages above show a clear and obvious picture that Antone contacted Bezahler for one reason, to purchase narcotics,\u201d the report states. There is never any indication that the drugs include fentanyl, just a downward arrow in the messages that is a reference to heroin, according to the records. \nDuring a police interview that will be used as evidence at his Dec. 18 trial, Mr. Bezahler said a third person was present for the drug buy, and that he was just facilitating it. \u201cI didn\u2019t sell him the heroin that killed him,\u201d he told police, according to the transcript. \nPolice doubted that story, pointing out that all of the texts were between Mr. Bezahler and Mr. Silvia. \nMs. Marcus said her client continues to maintain his innocence. As for who will defend him on the manslaughter charge, Ms. Marcus said that will ultimately be a superior court case, and she does not have the qualifications to defend in superior court. \nThe Silvia family lost a son, a brother, and a father. \u201cHe was a wonderful boy, he had a smile that lit up the whole room.

It will be enough to consider one of the two process $x^{+}_t$ and $x^{-}_t$, that we can denote by $x(t)$. It has the representation $$ x(t) = \\sum_{\\{k: \\, T_k \\leq t\\}} e^{- \\alpha [t - T_k ]} \\eta_k $$ where $T_k$ are the arrivals of the Poisson Process. For $\\Delta > 0$ we have $$ x(t + \\Delta) = \\sum_{\\{k: \\, T_k \\leq t\\}} e^{- \\alpha [t + \\Delta - T_k ]} \\eta_k + \\sum_{\\{k: \\, t < T_k \\leq t + \\Delta\\}} e^{- \\alpha [t + \\Delta - T_k ]} \\eta_k = e^{-\\alpha \\Delta} x(t) + \\varepsilon . $$ \nIn the second sum denoted as $\\varepsilon$, the arrivals $T_k$ and the jumps $\\eta_k$ are independent of the history $\\{x(s);\\, s \\leq t \\}$, and so is $\\varepsilon$. So $x(t)$ is a Markov process. Moreover, conditional on the number of arrivals on $(t,\\,t+ \\Delta)$, say $J$, we know that the r.vs $T_k - t$ have the distribution of the order statistics of a sample of size $J$ of the uniform distribution on $(0,\\,\\Delta)$. So \n\\begin{equation} \\varepsilon = \\sum_{j=1}^J e^{-\\alpha U_j} \\eta_j' \\tag{1} \\end{equation} \nwhere the $\\eta_j'$ are i.i.d. from the distribution of $\\eta_k$ and the $U_j$ are uniform on $(0,\\,\\Delta)$. The sum is understood as $0$ when $J =0$. \nTherefore the simulation of $x(t + \\Delta)$ conditional on $\\{x(s);\\, s \\leq t \\}$ can be as follows \nDraw the number of jumps $J$ on $(t,\\,t+ \\Delta)$ from the Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda \\Delta$. \nDraw $J$ i.i.d r.vs $U_j$ from the uniform on $(0,\\,\\Delta)$ and $J$ i.i.d r.vs $\\eta_j'$ from the jump distribution. \nTake $x(t + \\Delta) = e^{-\\alpha \\Delta} x(t) + \\varepsilon$ where $\\varepsilon$ is obtained by (1). \nIf $t_i^\\star$ is an increasing sequence of observation times which is independent of the process $x(t)$, then we can simulate the sequence $x(t_i^\\star)$ by simulating $x(t_i^\\star)$ conditional on the history at $t = t_{i-1}^\\star$ for $i > 0$, as in the code of the question. The sequence $x(t_i^\\star)$ is a Markov chain, and it is time-homogeneous if $t_i^\\star-t_{i-1}^\\star$ is constant. \nInterestingly, it can be shown that when the jump distribution is exponential with scale $1/ \\gamma$, the stationary distribution of $x(t)$ is gamma with shape $\\lambda / \\alpha$ and scale $1 / \\gamma$. This distribution can be used to draw the initial value $x(t_0^\\star)$, and we have an example of Markov chain with gamma margin as in this question .

\nHere\u2019s a nice Dutch Colonial Revival in Midwood, which could use some updating but has considerable space, some nice details and looks to be in good shape. A freestander with a gambrel roof, a front porch and a garage, it\u2019s at 1334 East 24th Street, near Avenue M. \nIt\u2019s got five bedrooms split among the top two floors, including a spacious master with an en suite bath and a walk-in closet, according to the listing. Below sits a large living room with a brick fireplace; a dining room with wainscoting, leaded glass windows and a coffered ceiling; and a kosher kitchen with a breakfast nook and a pantry. \nThere are parquet floors in good shape, a landing bench and a nice stained glass window in the landing \u2014 note the Dutch windmill in the inset. Save this listing on Brownstoner Real Estate to get price, availability and open house updates as they happen >> \nThere are rough edges here and there and some upgrading may be needed, including the four bathrooms, which aren\u2019t pictured. \nThere\u2019s central air and laundry in the basement \u2014 with a laundry chute accessible from all floors. \nListed by Lisa Kraner of Manhattan Living Realty, the house is asking $1.995 million.

Trump's move breaks with decades of U.S. policy to recognize Jerusalem as the capital, with previous administrations avoiding moves that could inflame tensions in the region. Jerusalem is a holy city to Muslims, Jews and Christians and has long been highly contested between Israel and Palestine. Israel claims all of the city is a united capital under its control, while the Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.

I am on Tau where there is hardly any more players and yet I still manager over 100 CT's so it is possible with effort. Quote: Go to Page Top Vergry Hot for Teacher\nPosts 739 6 Jun 6th 2014, 12:54pm\nFirst off, Tau is hardly the 'older worlds' I was referring too and having over 100 CTs is really a drop in a bucket when you have 12 towns and all of them have lvl 16+ museums...try needing 200 CTs to be full and maybe you'll see where this suggestion comes from.\nSecondly, building slots? What? Maybe slots are an issue to players with new accounts but once you get your GRs and Dumps fully upgraded...not so much. I would happily sacrifice a resource reducer(wine press, glassblower, etc) or even a warehouse(if I wasn't doing piracy) to not have to deal with constantly finding CTs. I might even consider demolishing museums to put an amphitheater in its place...yeah it doesn't give the same satisfaction bonuses but at least what it supplies is a constant. Really am tired of seeing: \"We have found out that insert name's citizens have disappeared. We are going to remove this city's cultural goods from insert name's public exhibition rooms so that we can store them in a safe place. Now our museums have space for new cultural goods treaties again.\"\nPlus, needing 200+ CTs to keep your museums full is really a pain in the butt when there are prolly only 200 active people left in your server and you want to go to war. Back when the servers were active it used to not matter so much when you went to war. Cancel/break your CTs and get new ones. Today it's quite a bit more difficult to get CTs so it makes going to war that much more difficult (i.e. less fun). Num-nums!

Thats the one question GF would want the answer to before deciding to add it. One CT would be replaced for every 2 levels of this buildings. (70 satisfaction points per cts, right? Am i remembering that wrong?) With a hardcap of 32, thats about 16 CTs per town or 192 CTs if you put one in 12 towns. GF wont go for that. I love this idea and I really want to see it added since it is so badly needed. To see that it gets added, we need to look at it as GF would, not as the players will. I know it sucks right?\nIf we made it cost more or the same amount in resources than a museum to upgrade, whats the magical number that make GF see it as a much needed benefit rather than a limitation for interaction between players? If we can find that magical number, we will find the sweet spot that makes GF purr about adding it.\nPut it where the pirate fort goes. People have to choose between having a fort and playing pirates or this building. People with 12 towns, who need this the most, arent playing pirates anyway because without mobile capability, they cant really compete.

Quote: Go to Page Top bringiton212 Wanderer\nPosts 89 12 Jun 9th 2014, 3:52pm\nYep multiple wine towns work, but why would you want to tie up your tradeships moving wine around when you need them to move marble or for pillaging? You didnt need to before you lost so many CTs or at least not as heavily. You are paying your citizens to produce wine so they can produce more wine so they stay happy enough to produce wine. when do you get to build? Where do you get other resources? If you need multiple wine towns to keep your citizens happy, you dont have the resources to use the premium trader and pillaging provides slim pickings on older servers as demonstrated by the lack of CTs, why would anyone keep playing the game?\nheres an idea that could encourage people to keep playing and the response is get more wine towns. If that worked, do you honestly think people would mention that CTs are a problem or would look for solutions to that problem? We are talking about builders here. I havent met a builder yet who wasnt self sufficient. If they are asking for something, its needed. On July 12th, 2015, the 'gentle giant' lost his 14 year war with cancer.

The waste discarding are beneficial for the users with several aspects like providing healthy and hygienic conditions in your kitchen; reducing the dangers of global warming and reducing the environmental pollution and they also save a lot of your time by providing a quick discarding of the food leftovers. Have a look at the article on Tips on how to clean the Garbage Disposal Henrico VA .\n\nEven though there are systems in place for a proper waste management, yet it is proving to be difficult to bring it under control. The waste disposal has been followed since time immemorial. There has been a continuous effort to bring out new developments in waste management techniques and devices. In the early times, haulers were salaried by natives to take their junk and dispose of it on the outer edge of the municipality.\n\nIf you're not familiar with it, a discarding or garburator is a machine found under your sink that cuts up food waste into smaller pieces to effortlessly pass through the plumbing. This can greatly help discourage the formation of the horrible smell that old rubbish gives off. Before acquiring a rubbish dumping unit, you have to keep in mind that you should choose one that has a minimum of one-half horsepower installed in it.\n\nWhen you use the trash removal it is better if you run the water during the process, for it will assist the unit in getting rid of the food particles that might be trapped in the housing. Also put the stopper in the sink drain, fill water in the basin approximately to the middle point and pour some of the dish-cleaner. You can also use ice and rock salt together for the cleanup of your sink clearance.\n\nThere are many different means of disposing of the waste which is being followed all over the globe. The landfill is the most common way of discarding and accounts for a huge chunk of the nation's refuse. It requires large tracts of land, and at times it has also proven too hazardous for the drinking water in the area of the landfill. It is still the most cost-effective method of garbage management.\n\nOther features of this junk machine include detachable splash guards (for easy inspection and clean up) and a 180-degree stainless steel swivel impellers that greatly lessen incidences of jamming. For a high-quality product, it's reasonably priced at 219.00 dollars with a ten-year In-Home Service and Lifetime Corrosion Warranty.\n\nBut you have to be careful with the rubber flaps of your dumping as they might get damaged with the acidic qualities of the vinegar. Therefore, before going for this cleaning method remove the rubber flaps then fill the drain area fully with baking soda and add vinegar into it then leave the solution for an hour and then rinse it with cold water and run it for at least a minute.\n\nHe developed and brought forth the machine in the market in 1940. Since then there have been many changes in the machine, but the three main types of junk disposals that are more popular are: Continuous-feed Disposals: This is the most commonly used disposal devices. As the name suggests, it can have a continuous supply waste as long as the water is running. The opening to the discarding remains open during the whole operation to facilitate the easy process.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can get a summary of the factors to consider when choosing a garbage disposal Henrico VA company at http://www.neie.com/waste-management right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "helen jones", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "henrico va", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henrico va company", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:39.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "73f4d602932f033da8a08fa3067fe9cd9190133a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pkSOsKXlzartA8Wjag8FVT7ZqI1TM8tr9", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/o/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/o/ - Auto - 4chan", "title": "Shitbox thread?

This would be a form of imposing constraints from the perspective of the user (who has to code it in), but not the perspective of the solver (who no longer directly receives the corresponding constraint). Another trick: a covariance matrix $C$ can be expressed using unconstrained matrix $U$, where $C = U^T U$. But, this increases both computation and number of parameters compared to using $C$ directly and constraining it to be a positive semidefinite symmetric matrix. \u2013 user20160 Feb 17 at 20:14 Yes, good perspective to shift it from the solver to the user. You can also only consider triangular $U$. That way, you don't over specify the system since most of the parameters are $0$. \u2013 bayerj Feb 17 at 20:17 Right, right, cholesky decomposition. Much better. \u2013 user20160 Feb 17 at 20:27 +1 great answer! could you explain more on \"it naturally produces valid parameters for the mixture distribution on every iteration\"?

Moreover we can directly optimize the true likelihood instead of the variational lower bound. \nHowever even in such cases EM often turns out to be a better algorithm than gradient decent.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:39.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e7e53548ea7f29ae465b28096afdb82169463422", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_StcUp8dvfnewyYIof8B8kNRbBJ5hssMh3jGpEi9vxYXL7kcZ2eXmf1miKvz6ESo-", "site_full": "www.bikechatforums.com", "site": "bikechatforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.bikechatforums.com/viewforum.php?f=47", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Politics &amp;

See http://bit.ly/fluoridetool . Also see http://bit.ly/fluorideDPH . When the order posting was discovered in the back of the Vineyard Gazette, many scrambled to interpret and understand the law, as the 90-day petition clock to stop the order was ticking. Fact \u2014 The water department requested to meet with the selectmen, and it was confirmed that we were placed on their agenda for the upcoming Monday meeting to discuss the law and the power of the board of health order. Fact \u2014 Health agent Matt Poole interfered, and had us removed from the selectmen\u2019s agenda. I reached out to the selectmen, and was told that I had nothing to worry about, as they were assured by Matt Poole   to go to the voters. We then reviewed the law together, and they agreed that they misunderstood (hesitating to say they were misinformed by Matt Poole). They were extremely concerned, and allowed us to meet with them, at which time the selectmen agreed that they wanted the voters to decide, not the board of health. Chairman Art Smadbeck requested at least three times that they rescind their order during a board of health meeting. Under pressure, Harold Zadeh made a motion to vote to rescind the order in case a petition to allow the voters to decide at the next election failed. Dr. Orazem refused to \u201csecond\u201d that motion. As you know, Kathie Case abstained. A petition had begun to stop the \u201corder.\u201d Matt Poole attempted to interfere with the petition multiple times by requesting that the language of the petition be changed, which would have voided the petition signatures already obtained and cut further into the 90 days allowed for a successful petition. He continued to attempt to interfere even after town counsel informed him that he could not be involved with the petition initiative. The question remains whether the order was initiated by the DPH legitimately, and if the board of health completed an investigation regarding fluoride as required by the law before voting to \u201corder\u201d as required and illustrated in the language of the law. For every fluoride pro, there is a con. The board of health has failed to educate anyone before voting the order, or schedule any education forums at the library as promised, since opposition began. I first was on the fence, as I was uneducated. So I educated myself. The fact is that fluoride helps minimize cavities, and the best way to receive fluoride is by application. The worst way to receive fluoride is by ingesting. Vineyard Smiles is a state-funded program that provides free dental care to children at the town schools and to adults. Fluoride application (not ingesting) is part of the free program, in addition to other dental services. There was a lawsuit filed on April 18 against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to stop the addition of fluoride into all municipal water supplies nationwide. See http://bit.ly/fluoridelawsuit . The details of the lawsuit illustrate the cons/risks to human health. I asked Dr. Orazem during a public meeting who their target was. He replied by informing that it was children who are not from the \u201cBeaver Cleaver\u201d-type home environment. The board of health has failed to prove that their \u201ctarget\u201d actually drinks town water. It is most likely that their \u201ctarget\u201d drink sugar drinks, not town water. In my opinion, it makes no sense to spend over $650K to add fluoride (which is a poison) to our water supply when there is a possibility that adding fluoride will be banned in the near future; or to add fluoride to a water supply for consumption, which causes harm to humans, as illustrated in the lawsuit. Most of the the fluoride would end up in the ground, causing other problems. It makes more sense to promote a program that provides fluoride by application, which would effectively reach all those in need who want it, and avoid those who feel at risk if exposed and do not want fluoride in their bodies or the ground.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "art smadbeck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathie case", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harold zadeh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orazem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt poole", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "editor health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department of public health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. environmental protection agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "edgartown", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:40.031+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1af32b5bfdbddcd36d07ae335295487eb72e01d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8d16vGifqLMzQPDpNShBT4V4mfF7EsJfOBX3WnoXXzFK25YdNF_eqTl7J947By0P5cn2Gx5igfeJy6S3Sby8Xqk2E_MOvTT1S2u5VtY1TIynVYplMl57lETs..fXToMGnmD3axuJW4uA--", "site_full": "www.eu-startups.com", "site": "eu-startups.com", "site_section": "http://www.eu-startups.com", "site_categories": ["job_fairs", "jobs", "hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents"], "section_title": "EU-Startups", "title": "London-based deep learning startup Chattermill closes \u20ac681K seed round", "title_full": "London-based deep learning startup Chattermill closes \u20ac681K seed round", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1af32b5bfdbddcd36d07ae335295487eb72e01d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8d16vGifqLMzQPDpNShBT4V4mfF7EsJfOBX3WnoXXzFK25YdNF_eqTl7J947By0P5cn2Gx5igfeJy6S3Sby8Xqk2E_MOvTT1S2u5VtY1TIynVYplMl57lETs..fXToMGnmD3axuJW4uA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "contact@bcurdy.com", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "London-based deep learning startup Chattermill closes \u20ac681K seed round", "text": "London-based deep learning startup Chattermill closes \u20ac681K seed round By 0 190 \nChattermill , a London-based startup using deep learning to understand what customers are talking about and how they feel about their experiences, has just announced it has closed a seed round of \u20ac681,000. The startup has been backed by Entrepreneur First, Avonmore Developments and angel investors including Jeff Kelisky, CEO of Seedrs. \nThis seed round is in addition to an earlier round in 2016 from the same group of investors, bringing the total raised to date to over \u20ac1 million. The company was co-founded by Mikhail Dubov and Dmitry Isupov in 2015 while at Entrepreneur First. \nChattermill counts numerous fast-growth businesses as its clients, and is working with billion dollar valued companies such as Transferwise, Deliveroo, HelloFresh and Just Eat, as well as more traditional businesses including TSB. \nChattermill collates all feedback channels in one place and then builds a customised deep learning model to extract easily actionable insight. It can then measure sentiment to see how customers are feeling about each part of the overall experience, from design of the app down to speed of delivery and attitude of customer care agents, enabling companies to have a truly customer centric approach and culture. \nMikhail Dubov, CEO and Co-Founder of Chattermill, commented: \u201c We\u2019re thrilled to have the ongoing support of such a great list of investors. We\u2019ve been lucky enough to help some of the world\u2019s most customer centric businesses see genuine value by understanding their users at scale. Our platform not only challenges their assumptions, but gives them incredibly detailed insight in real-time, at a fraction of the cost of traditional customer experience research.\u201d \nChattermill easily integrates with tools already used by a company \u2013 such as SurveyMonkey, Zendesk, TypeForm or Salesforce \u2013 aggregating every piece of feedback such as Net Promoter Score surveys, reviews, support tickets and social media, for a thorough analysis of the customer experience. The team is currently working with customers across sectors that include, Fintech, E-commerce, Travel and Gaming. \nNilan Peiris, VP of Growth at Transferwise, added: \u201cChattermill enables our teams to take customer insights deeper than ever before and focus on the key factors that make a difference to our users and drive our growth. We have more than a hundred people across the business using Chattermill to ensure Transferwise is always at the cutting edge when it comes to customer experience.\u201d \nChattermill was part of Entrepreneur First\u2019s Spring 2015 cohort, and has since grown to a team of 10. The funding secured will be used to invest in technology and continue growing the team with hires that include data scientists, engineers and business developers. \nMatt Clifford, CEO and Co-Founder of Entrepreneur First, said: \u201cWe saw the opportunity in Chattermill from the very beginning and are happy to continue to back Mikhail, Dmitry and their growing team. They are a fantastic example of how machine learning and AI can dramatically impact product development by listening to what the customer really needs.

The book tells of the mythical travels and speeches of Zarathustra, a man who has lived alone in a cave for 10 years. He decides to travel and spread the word of his new found love and wisdom, and he also wants to teach humanity about his discovery of the \u2018overman\u2019; a man who is free from prejudice and the morality of humanity. Zarathustra has come to the conclusion that humanity is the connection between this overman and the rest of the planets animals, however, when he tells the people of a nearby town, Motley Cow, the majority of people do not seem to understand. This is when Zarathustra decides to concentrate on the people who seem to understand and want to learn about the overman.\nThe first parts of this novel are mostly speeches by Zarathustra that outline Nietzsche\u2019s philosophy, despite being in allegorical and symbolic forms. Zarathustra is highly critical of mass gatherings, namely, \u2018the rabble\u2019; a clear attack on organised religion, and specifically Christianity. This is just one of the many criticisms of Christianity found in the book. Another key point against Christianity are the values of good and evil, and the belief in an afterlife; we have no evidence of this afterlife, so why do we waste our time trying to attain it? This view isn\u2019t really discussed by Zarathustra, but is just taken as truth, there is no afterlife. I think this text is probably the most outspoken about the idea that \u2018God is dead\u2019, it does however also reject nationalism and mass politics, two other key ideas of Nietzsche.\nI would thoroughly suggest reading this book, it gives an insight into Nietzsche, without the really complicated terminology of other philosophers or historians. It is split into four sections, each with very short chapters which makes it incredibly easy to read. I read most of it in short spurts, reading on or two sections at a time. I think this way of writing philosophy is brilliant as it allows more time for reflection by the reader.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

few days. I had lots of fun creating various components in a few different colorways, and the odd time, I come up with a shape I want to try just for fun.\n\nI set these aside to make a pair of earrings for this blog post late in the evening (hence the artificial lighting - sorry!!).

The hints of coco brown, and the speckles of Gold metal leaf add just enough sparkle to my liking!\n\nI've used some anodized aluminum rings in the colors that pick up the pink and gold, and some Tierra Cast hammer textured components at the top to add a quick touch of rustic sparkle.

It is, frankly, an integral part of the historical fabric of our community, which is likely why so many have grappled so hard to protect it. It seems clear that going forward in the modern era, the future of this ritual is trending toward aquaculture rather than traditional commercial fishing practices. This development is likely a good thing, particularly for wild stocks, but it\u2019s incumbent upon us as a town to usher in this transition in a mindful, sensible, and informed manner that considers the wishes and needs of those currently involved or hoping to become involved in aquaculture businesses while simultaneously protecting the interests of the public and conserving the natural pulchritude of our estuaries and near-shore waterways. \nExpansion of oyster farm grants into Cape Poge is premature and misguided. Simply put, Cape Poge is a wildlife refuge. It is an important nursery for fish, both fin and shell, and is incredibly valuable as a recreational area for Islanders, seasonal residents, and visitors alike. Many have fought tooth and nail to maintain the pristine nature of the pond and its surrounding lands since the Trustees acquired the property in the late 1950s, and likely before that. Although shellfish farming is a sustainable, low-impact, and even environmentally beneficial practice in theory, it is none the less a commercial operation, and one that is particularly equipment-profuse. Barges, rafts, scows, cages, bags, lines, buoy fields, pressure washers, tumblers, trucks, and vans are just some of industrial apparatuses that accompany oyster cultivation. Unlike the paraphernalia associated with the limited commercial fishing activity that currently occurs in the pond, this gear is semi-permanent, as anyone who\u2019s attempted to navigate Katama Bay in the past 15 or so years can attest. \nI am intimately familiar with the challenges facing young people trying to make a life and a living here on the Vineyard (particularly from the sea), and, believe me, I\u2019m most sympathetic to their desire to stay and to thrive. But to run roughshod over one of a small handful of truly undisturbed natural habitats left on the Island in an attempt to help achieve that end is shortsighted and imprudent. Prior to the discussion of Cape Poge as a potential location for aquaculture grants, we should first explore any and all potential alternatives, and subsequently analyze their pros and cons in hopes of coming to the most informed conclusion that we can. \nThese might include, but are not limited to, further expansion of the current Katama Bay program, exploring the potential for the utilization of other inland waterways that already have more coastal development than Cape Poge (one of which the shellfish department has already proven is a viable/productive area for shellfish cultivation), and assessing the logistics of moving aquaculture operations into slightly deeper near-coastal waters \u2014 a model that has seemingly been confirmed as operable by the Cottage City Oyster farm in Oak Bluffs. \nIf all other options are contemplated and considered and the conclusion of the shellfish committee and the selectmen is that the best plan for the expansion of aquaculture in Edgartown is to bring it to Chappaquiddick, then at least we can take solace in the fact that the decision was enlightened. I, however, am confident and hopeful that we will arrive at a different outcome.
