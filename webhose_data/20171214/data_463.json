The building in question called DLH Enclave, located in Oshiwara, suburban Mumbai, and has seen some major modifications in the flats of Kapil Sharma and Mika Singh. \nReportedly, Mika Singh too is facing similar charges as Kapil Sharma for making changes like unauthorized merger of elevation features, ducts, voids and part podium for the parking among others which is quite contradictory to the Occupation Certificate [OC] plan that was submitted. According to the MRTP Act [Maharashtra Regional Town Planning], the 10 th floor flat of Mika Singh is now being scrutinized by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation [BMC] officials who have now directed him to make the given changes in 10 days further claiming that the illegal constructions will be demolished if he doesn\u2019t abide by their instructions. \nOn the other hand, Mika Singh\u2019s lawyer Yadunath Bhargavan who has now got a stay on the demolition order, asserts that his client was unaware of the altercations when he purchased the flat from the developer in 2017. Reinstating that his client is an innocent third party, the lawyer further added that his client purchased the flat under a registered agreement for sale on the promises made by the developer. Also mentioning that the other flat owners too have received similar notices, Yadunath went on to state that the OC was given to the developer before Amrik [aka Mika Singh] purchased the flat. \nHowever, BMC officials continue to stand by their statements, reportedly, maintaining that it was the occupant\u2019s responsibility to ensure that altercations aren\u2019t made against the plan approved by the BMC after receiving the OC. They also firmly explained that notices have been sent to the occupants and that they will continue to fight the case against the occupants only. \nBesides this, we also hear that DLH Enclave has previously been trapped in many controversies including complaints about it being illegal which was a question raised by the neighbouring building Windermere.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mika singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irrfan khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yadunath bhargavan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kapil sharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yadunath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amrik", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dlh enclave", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brihanmumbai municipal corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "occupation certificate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bmc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "windermere", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oshiwara", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:27.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a0b260796c90ca1406744d073abafda4b7f3d0e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWZ5Qwe35OYZIMOsW6fut9dFEfao0KOtyO9vz_rSNN2QDJFPZDIyYnzfjVqDlJlg8-", "site_full": "www.blowoutforums.com", "site": "blowoutforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.blowoutforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=7", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "FOOTBALL - Blowout Cards Forums", "title": "Cheapest acceptable way to send a single low-value card?", "title_full": "Cheapest acceptable way to send a single low-value card? - Blowout Cards Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T12:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7d1405f49a132d0516fa69f2a01754212831dfb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWZ5Qwe35OYZIMOsW6fut9dFEfao0KOtyO9vz_rSNN2QDJFPZDIyYnpCgsK1W8dxcg6c11MVHYiUe.U3.S1E6b", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "3124508 on COMC", "published": "2017-12-06T12:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : Hey all.

I\u2019m not entirely sure if this is what 33 year old Amanda Liberty is doing either but it\u2019s certainly along those lines. She claims to be sexually attracted to objects and has done so ever since she fell in love with a drum kit at the age of 14. Amanda even changed her surname to Liberty after visiting New York and having a fling with the famous statue. She now has her sights set firmly on chandeliers and one in particular named Lumiere, who she bought off a German guy on eBay for \u00a3400. Despite the fact she\u2019s now proposed to Lumiere, Amanda has also admitted that she\u2019s also in an open relationship with the 25 other chandeliers she owns as well. Lumiere is apparently OK with this. Here\u2019s what she had to say about it all: Last Valentine\u2019s Day I proposed to her, to signify our long-lasting love. I hope at some point we will have a commitment ceremony. I haven\u2019t been engaged before, so it\u2019s very new and exciting! None of my chandeliers are jealous of each other. They understand that I love them all for their different personalities. For example, I love kissing and cuddling Lumiere, but I sleep with Jewel every night as she is portable and very nice to cuddle. I\u2019ve always loved the look of chandeliers and when I saw my first chandelier, Luna, it was love at first sight. You can\u2019t control who you fall in love with and things just went from there. I want others to see how happy the chandeliers make me, and how much they\u2019ve enriched my life. I\u2019m not hurting anyone by entering into a relationship with them. I am simply just following my heart. Last edited by mercurial; 07-12-2017 at 10:41 AM . Feeling down?

In addition to working on Harry Potter Wizards Unite , Niantic\u2019s flagship game, Pok\u00e9mon GO will have two big releases this week: 50 new Pok\u00e9mon from the Hoenn region, as well as dynamic, in-game weather effects. \nAccording to Niantic\u2019s announcement , the starter Pok\u00e9mon originally from the Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Pok\u00e9mon Sapphire video games; Treecko, Torchic and Mudkip, will start appearing in Pok\u00e9mon GO sometime this week. Other Pok\u00e9mon from the Hoenn region will be appearing in a staggered release over the next few weeks as well. \nThe bigger change, however, is the new dynamic weather system. The in-game map will be updated with new weather visuals showing rain, snow, sunshine and so on. But it\u2019s not just a cosmetic enhancement, the weather will actually affect your Pok\u00e9mon. \nCertain Pok\u00e9mon types will be more commonly found, depending on the weather. For example, Mudkip and other water types are more likely to spawn when it\u2019s raining. On top of this, when you\u2019re battling at gyms, the efficacy of your Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s attacks will be affected by the weather as well. Fire-type attacks will do better on sunny days, water type attacks on rainy days and so on. \nWhile I do think the addition of the weather effects will make the game more interesting and varied, I don\u2019t know how keen I am to be out playing Pok\u00e9mon GO while it\u2019s raining, umbrella or not! But, like most new additions to the game, I\u2019m happy to give them a try. I just hope that areas where certain weather (like snow) never happens won\u2019t miss out on the chance to catch weather-specific Pok\u00e9mon types. \nLast Updated: December 7, 2017 Share this:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pok\u00e9mon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mudkip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hoenn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treecko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "torchic", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry potter wizards unite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niantic labs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pok\u00e9mon sapphire", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pok\u00e9mon ruby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pok\u00e9mon go", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hoenn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niantic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:28.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc469607134e1cebaac08c0efafc2af728ad0713", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pjEE7ve6gczeEHOxxH4dxmE5epWubaaxH", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/sp/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/sp/ -

Ayesha Jhulka, who had slowly graduated towards exit from Bollywood, is all set to return to the big screen with Gadar director Anil Sharma\u2019s next. \nWe all are aware that Anil Sharma is directing Genius which features his son Utkarsh in the leading role for the first time. Ayesha Jhulka will play the role of Utkarsh\u2019s love interest Ishita Chauhan\u2019s mother in the film. Describing her role as that of a cool mom, Ayesha stated that it was Anil Sharma who persuaded her to take up this role. Yet another reason why she was attracted to this character was because it was not that of a quintessential Indian mother. \nAyesha Jhulka revealed that her character is classy, elegant and that of an independent woman who is liberal and shares a very cordial and friendly relationship with her daughter. Although she admitted that returning to acting was a tad bit unnerving especially during the photo shoots, now she asserted that she is all charged up to shoot for the film which kicks off tomorrow, December 8. \nExplaining that this has been more of a homecoming experience for her, Ayesha mentioned that what made her comfortable was the fact that she is getting to work with people whom she already knows like designer Shaahid Amir who have been in the industry for over decades. \nOn the other hand, Ayesha Jhulka is also looking into kicking off her own venture as a director. According to recent reports, the actress confessed that while she hasn\u2019t been getting interesting offers from web and other mediums, she herself wanted to venture into Bollywood by exploring other options. So she decided to direct a film along with her husband and business tycoon Sameer Vashi. \nTalking about the venture, Ayesha maintained that it is a love story set at the backdrop of consumerism. At the same time, she also expressed that the film is in the initial stages and that she expects to roll the film in a year or so.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anil sharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ayesha jhulka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ishita chauhan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shaahid amir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jo jeeta wohi sikandar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utkarsh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anjali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sameer vashi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ayesha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gadar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sangram", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "khiladi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurbaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bollywood", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:28.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a0b260796c90ca1406744d073abafda4b7f3d0e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWZ5Qwe35OYZIMOsW6fut9dFEfao0KOtyO9vz_rSNN2QDJFPZDIyYnzfjVqDlJlg8-", "site_full": "www.blowoutforums.com", "site": "blowoutforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.blowoutforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=7", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "FOOTBALL - Blowout Cards Forums", "title": "Cheapest acceptable way to send a single low-value card?", "title_full": "Cheapest acceptable way to send a single low-value card? - Blowout Cards Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T12:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3dde8ec298714af700b844562b1a5d07992c468b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWZ5Qwe35OYZIMOsW6fut9dFEfao0KOtyO9vz_rSNN2QDJFPZDIyYnpCgsK1W8dxcg6c11MVHYia92COo0e.gi", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "majestik101", "published": "2017-12-06T13:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Carrier pigeon.

Channel NewsAsia", "text": "Share via E-Mail Bookmark \nSHANGHAI: A showboating eSports star dubbed \"the Korean Conor McGregor\" played part of a one-sided final using his bare toes, provoking a furious response from his humiliated Chinese rival. \nSouth Korea's Lim Hong-Gyu at another point folded his arms and pretended to sleep as he thrashed Luo \"Legend\" Xian in their StarCraft: Remastered showdown in the United States. \nThe bout - which pitted the two players against each other in a hugely popular sci-fi strategy game - was watched by thousands of fans online and sparked debate about whether Lim was arrogant or brilliant. \nLuo consequently branded Lim - better known by his playing nickname \"Larva\" and likened to the brash and colourful Irish MMA star McGregor - \"a clown\". \nUS organisers were also unamused by Lim's antics during the Zotac Cup Masters event on Sunday (Dec 3). \n\"It is unfortunate that the behaviour of one of the players may have caused an uproar in the professional gaming community, however, it does not speak for nor does it represent Zotac or the Zotac Cups,\" a statement read. Advertisement Advertisement \nIt added: \"Hereby we sincerely apologise to our fans, the Zotac Cup community and any players or persons impacted by the incident.\" \nA separate statement in Chinese on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, said Lim would not be allowed to take part again. \nBut that did not placate Luo or Chinese eSports fans. \nAn angry Luo hit out at his Korean opponent on Weibo, writing: \"What kind of fun could you have got from this or is this to win some idiot fans? \n\"When I first heard about you, I thought you got the success you deserved for your efforts. I thought that was inspiring. \n\"Now I see that I was blind. Your behaviour is just that of a clown,\" Luo added. \n\"This is the difference between you and a champion player. Trash.\" \nLim's behaviour stirred fierce debate among eSports enthusiasts, with some saying he was unprofessional but others applauding his audaciousness after using his left foot to play, while keeping his right hand on the computer mouse. \nExperts commentating on the game as it unfolded were impressed however. \n\"He's just a beautiful human being,\" said one broadcaster. \n\"This is literally a joke that players would use in StarCraft to say, 'I can beat you playing with my feet.'\" \nSpeaking via a translator in a post match interview, Lim said he often played with his feet outside of tournaments. \n\"You should only do it against people that you are 100 per cent confident of beating with your feet,\" he added.

A few subtle tweaks and a minor refresh make it an even stronger contender in this fast-growing segment. \nThe new NX maintains its aggressive lines and sporty demeanour with new headlamps, new chrome-framed front and side grilles, and remodelled bumpers. At the rear, new LED taillights will differentiate the facelift model from its predecessor. The F-Sport model gets even angrier with black-chrome details all around the grilles. \nLexus is also following suit with the Germans when it comes to their naming strategy for the different engine derivatives. The \u2018200t\u2019 badge (signifying a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine) has been replaced by \u2018300\u2019, referring to the horsepower developed by the engine. \nThis means that the new Lexus NX will be offered in 300 E, EX and F Sport derivatives respectively. \nThe entry-level E model adopts a 2WD drivetrain as opposed to its AWD predecessor, where power is sent to the front wheels through a 6-speed auto \u2018box to reduce weight and improve fuel economy. \nThe middle and top-of-the-range EX and F Sport derivatives will keep their AWD setups alongside the 6-speed automatic transmission. The suspension on the F-Sport model is further improved by borrowing the latest version of Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) from the Lexus LC Coupe. \nThe NX300 will come standard with Lexus\u2019 trusted 2.0-litre turbocharged \u20184-pot\u2019 engine, dishing out a healthy 175 kW of power and 350Nm of torque while the hybrid-powered NX300h will ship with a 2.5-litre 4-cylinder engine mated to an electric motor with a total system output of 150kW. \nAn all-new Custom driving mode makes its way to the NX, which allows drivers to personalise the powertrain, electric power steering, AVS and air conditioning settings. \nThe E models add rain-sensing wipers, auto-levelling headlamps and a reverse camera to the spec-sheets. The EX models are now kitted with roof rails and the F-Sport model gains Dynamic headlamp levelling, chrome steering switch accents, and aluminium detailing on the instrument cluster. \nThe interior also sees a welcomed update in the form of a new 10.3-inch display, along with fewer switches and improved graphics, which replaces the old 7-inch display. \nThe new Lexus NX will find its way to dealership floors by January 2018. \nModel Line-up & Pricing \nNX 300 E \u2013 R 599 900 \nNX 300 EX \u2013 R 677 300 \nNX 300 F Sport \u2013 R 789 700 \nNX 300h EX \u2013 R 746 700 \n\nAll Lexus NX models come with a 3-year/100 000 kilometer warranty.
