Lim based the forecast on the state\u2019s performance in terms of investments this year. According to figures released by the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida), Penang topped the list with approved investments in manufacturing valued at RM7.7 billion in the first half of 2017. Penang\u2019s manufacturing sector also contributed 45 per cent of the total investments in Malaysia. \u201cBased on these, we are confident of achieving a 6 per cent GDP growth this year,\u201d Lim said in his speech at the opening of Regus business centre in Menara Boustead this morning. Lim said Penang\u2019s GDP growth in 2016 had outperformed the country\u2019s overall expansion of 4.2 per cent. Penang\u2019s manufacturing GDP grew 5.4 per cent while its services sector recorded a 5.6 per cent increase last year. \u201cIn 2016, Penang also recorded the second largest investments for global establishments for services or principal hub with an investment value of RM4.1 billion, after Kuala Lumpur,\u201d he said. He added that this year, Austrian-based Swarovski, leading automotive software company Luxoft, Power Integrations and Teleperformance have announced their global business services (GBS) investments in Penang, while Toray and UST Global have increased re-investments in Penang. On the opening of the new Regus\u2019 new business centre, Lim said it will increase the available work and office space in Penang. \u201cThe demand for office space, especially for MSC status buildings, is increasing in Penang as Penang continues to attract more investments and business expansion,\u201d he said. He said a Knight Frank 2016 Real Estate Highlights reported occupancy rates for prime office buildings in George Town ranged from 86 per cent to 100 per cent and newer buildings in Bayan Baru have occupancy of around 97 per cent. Even the co-working space in @CAT Wisma Yeap Chor Ee, which is a state initiative, recorded an average of 94 per cent daily occupancy rate. \u201cPenang has the highest occupancy of office space in Malaysia,\u201d he said. With the opening of flexible workspaces provided by Regus, Lim said local small medium enterprises (SMEs) and businesses can leverage on these flexible working options to increase productivity and enhance their growth. He said Penang currently has more than 6,800 SMEs.

As the name Operation Faux Pharmacy suggests, the DEA is investigating whether these pharmacies distributed prescription opioids \u201coutside the bounds of legitimate medicine\u201d and in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. \nOf course, pharmacies exist to sell opioids and other drugs for patients who desperately need them, so you might be wondering why they are now being investigated for performing their primary function. It\u2019s almost certainly because the Justice Department has placed a high priority on prosecuting healthcare providers and others for the distribution of opioid pain medications in an attempt to address recent overdoses across the United States. \nWhile the Justice Department is right to concern itself with illegal drug distribution, the pharmacies in question here may have been operating well within the boundaries of federal law. We\u2019ve seen this type of case before, as our firm has represented doctors, pharmacists, and other healthcare practitioners who have been unfairly targeted for prescribing legal drugs to chronic pain patients, including terminal cancer patients, in an attempt to ease their constant suffering. \nUnder federal law, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 , it is a felony for two or more people to enter an agreement to illegally distribute controlled substances, which include drugs like cocaine, marijuana, and heroin, but also legal drugs. Licensed medical doctors who prescribe legal, legitimate medications like oxycodone, methadone, hydrocodone, or even Xanax have been arrested and prosecuted just like street-level drug dealers under this law. \nIn Operation Faux Pharmacy, it appears that the government is alleging that a large number of pharmacies in several states were filling prescriptions that should never have been issued by a doctor. Of course, it would be a defense to these charges if the pharmacies reasonably relied on the doctor\u2019s prescription in good faith and had no idea that the prescription was not issued for a legitimate medical purpose and in the ordinary course of a professional practice. \nUnder federal law, a pharmacy may rely on a licensed doctor\u2019s prescription when selling patients controlled substances. While the law should and does punish prescription forgery and doctors who write fraudulent prescriptions, not allowing pharmacies to rely on prescriptions written by licensed physicians would create an enormous obstacle between patients and their ability to get the medicine they need. \nOperation Faux Pharmacy may be the first step in a new initiative to go after pharmacies and other healthcare businesses who had no direct involvement in actually issuing prescriptions in an attempt to address the increasing number of opioid related deaths in the United States. But it would be unfortunate if such an initiative led to the arrest of legitimate pharmacists who only want to help people obtain the medications that were prescribed to them by licensed doctors in an attempt to ease their pain. The ends should not justify the means if it involves the arrest and prosecution of people who had no idea they were committing a crime.

Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) said Wednesday he interviewed a recently retired FBI supervisor who told him he was instructed by Deputy Director Andrew McCabe not to call the 2012 Benghazi attack an act of terrorism when distributing a report on the FBI findings to the larger intelligence community. The agent found the instruction concerning because his unit had gathered incontrovertible evidence showing a major al Qaeda figure had directed the attack and the information had already been briefed to President Obama, the lawmaker said. In the days after the 2012 attack, Obama administration officials initially said it was related to spontaneous Muslim anger over an anti-Islam video tape and not a planned-out act of terrorism. DeSantis argued the example highlights the politicization of the FBI.\"What operational reason would there be to issue an edict to agents telling them, in the face of virtually conclusive evidence to the contrary, not to categorize the Benghazi attack as a result of terrorism? By placing the interests of the Obama administration over the public's interests, the order is yet another data point highlighting the politicization of the FBI,\" DeSantis said. DeSantis and several other lawmakers say they plan to press Wray at a hearing Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee about growing concerns that certain FBI supervisors allowed political bias to cloud judgments or decisions. FBI officials did not immediately return a call seeking comment about DeSantis's allegations. 99 fishing crew, harpooning whales on the daily crew Today, 02:16 AM #2", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:54.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fb6c807435c2b5ffc5bedaa9c3aec2c438828180", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQBt.zJBM7pyqAnpFZ8mbo7DspoLXjBnUZBhRt7tvnNvKEM_G009nL8Yg8qDeQIQsSq7jyvX16ehW7UP2XDvYmLOo84T5t5LcMWGTZtifrHMfuveUK9MnWI", "site_full": "forums.macrumors.com", "site": "macrumors.com", "site_section": "http://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-apps-and-mac-app-store.2/index.rss", "site_categories": ["mac_support", "tech"], "section_title": "Mac Apps and Mac App Store", "title": "Mac mail to Outlook mac 2011 export issues", "title_full": "Mac mail to Outlook mac 2011 export issues", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.macrumors.com/styles/macrumors/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1213, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fb6c807435c2b5ffc5bedaa9c3aec2c438828180", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQBt.zJBM7pyqAnpFZ8mbo7DspoLXjBnUZBhRt7tvnNvKEM_G009nL8Yg8qDeQIQsSq7jyvX16ehW7UP2XDvYmLOo84T5t5LcMWGTZtifrHMfuveUK9MnWI", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "nickcage49 (invalid@example.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mac mail to Outlook mac 2011 export issues", "text": "I am at my wits end with this issue.

(Scott G Winterton/The Deseret News via AP) prev next comments SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Outdoor retailing giant Patagonia on Wednesday joined a flurry of lawsuits challenging President Donald Trump's decision to chop up two large national monuments in Utah could finally bring an answer to the much-debated question of whether presidents have the legal authority to undo or change monuments created by past presidents.\nUntil that question is answered months or years from now, the fate of the contested lands in Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments will remain unresolved.\nProclamations signed Monday by the president allow lands no longer protected as a national monument to be opened up in 60 days to mining, but conservation and tribal groups will likely try to keep that from happening.\nMark Squillace, professor of natural resources law at the University of Colorado-Boulder, said he doubts the federal government would permit mining so quickly after Trump's announcement because it would be bad politics, especially as the legal battle mushrooms.\nCalifornia-based Patagonia filed its lawsuit on behalf of several other organizations to block Trump's reductions to Bears Ears. The California-based company said in the lawsuit that Trump's proclamation shrinking the monument by 85 percent exceeds the president's authority and strips much-needed protections from sacred tribal lands.\nPatagonia also replaced its usual home page with a stark message, \"The President Stole Your Land.\"\nThe post drew a strong rebuke from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke who called it \"nefarious, false and a lie.\"\nThree lawsuits already had been filed involving Utah's monuments. And more are expected \u2014 especially if Trump follows Zinke's recommendations to shrink two other monuments \u2014 Gold Butte in Nevada and Cascade Siskiyou in Oregon.\nSupporters of Trump's move welcomed the fight, saying it will answer longstanding questions about presidential power involving the protection of land.\n\"Hopefully, we can have some closure on what the president can and cannot do,\" said Mike Noel, a Republican state representative in Utah who was on stage with the president during his proclamation signing in Salt Lake City.\nPast presidents have trimmed national monuments and redrawn their boundaries 18 times, according to the National Park Service.\nLegal experts disagree on whether the 1906 Antiquities Act \u2014 allowing presidents to create a monument \u2014 also lets them reduce one.\nThe question has never been settled in court, but conservation and paleontology groups and Native American tribes launching lawsuits are preparing to argue that Trump doesn't have that authority and his move jeopardizes a wealth of Native American artifacts, dinosaur fossils and rugged spaces.\n\"Gee whiz, it sounds like there are going to be a lot of attorneys making a whole lot of money,\" quipped Noel. \"For every organization, there's a lunch ticket for a group of attorneys to exist.\"\nNoel plans to intervene himself, filing a court brief to show support for the president's actions.\nDonald Kochan, a professor of natural resources, property and administrative law at Chapman University in Orange, California, believes Trump's action is likely legal and the separate lawsuits allow each group to show supporters they're speaking up.\nSquillace said the lawsuits will likely be merged into one case for each monument.\nHe thinks a court will try to focus on the overall question of whether Trump has the authority to reduce the monuments \u2014 something Squillace doesn't think the president has the legal authority to do.\nWhile the legal battles play out, Utah Republican Rep. Rob Bishop, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, has introduced a bill that would prevent presidents from designating monuments larger than 85,000 acres and give states and local officials the power to veto a monument larger than 10,000 acres.\nBishop's bill is awaiting a vote on the House floor.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Daly in Washington contributed to this report.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott g", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bowmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark squillace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew daly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "squillace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald kochan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob bishop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan zinke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zinke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve marcus/las vegas sun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike noel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press file", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interior", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah state capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chapman university in orange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national park service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winterton/the deseret news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of colorado-boulder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cascade siskiyou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press interior", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house natural resources committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "patagonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blanding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcloyd canyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salt lake city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bunkerville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:12:56.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "31d0023232f897e2229c9ba57d35db0830b84c27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxZA8C_wtUgYd0Q2n0HBRmbOl_uaxKVGY5gHS7ko6X.p.", "site_full": "blog.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/blog?query=a&start=245&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "\uc601\uc5b4\ud2b9\uac15 : \uc601\uc5b4\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ud154\ub9c1/\uad6d\uc81c\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ud154\ub7ec\uc5d0\uac8c \ub4e3\ub294 \ub9e4\uc9c1 \ud0a4\uc988 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ud154\ub9c1", "title_full": "\uc601\uc5b4\ud2b9\uac15 : \uc601\uc5b4\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ud154\ub9c1/\uad6d\uc81c\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ud154\ub7ec\uc5d0\uac8c \ub4e3\ub294 \ub9e4\uc9c1 \ud0a4\uc988 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ud154\ub9c1 : \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ube14\ub85c\uadf8", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "KS", "spam_score": 0.65, "main_image": "http://blogimgs.naver.net/nblog/mylog/post/og_default_image_160610.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "31d0023232f897e2229c9ba57d35db0830b84c27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxZA8C_wtUgYd0Q2n0HBRmbOl_uaxKVGY5gHS7ko6X.p.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\uc601\uc5b4\ubc15\uc0ac", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "\uc601\uc5b4\ud2b9\uac15 : \uc601\uc5b4\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ud154\ub9c1/\uad6d\uc81c\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ud154\ub7ec\uc5d0\uac8c \ub4e3\ub294 \ub9e4\uc9c1 \ud0a4\uc988 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ud154\ub9c1", "text": "\uc790\uc720\uae00\ub9c8\ub2f9 \uc601\uc5b4\ud2b9\uac15 : \uc601\uc5b4\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ud154\ub9c1/\uad6d\uc81c\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ud154\ub7ec\uc5d0\uac8c \ub4e3\ub294 \ub9e4\uc9c1 \ud0a4\uc988 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ud154\ub9c1 1\uc2dc\uac04 \uc804 URL \ubcf5\uc0ac \ubcf8\ubb38 \uae30\ud0c0 \uae30\ub2a5 \ubc88\uc5ed\ubcf4\uae30 http://blog.naver.com/savant5/221157824099\nBAND - Organize your groups A Fun Tool to Plan, Chat, Organize and Share with all of your Groups.

So that is a very sensitive matter (Once you are labeled as a terrorist you will be included in the list of all terrorists all over the world),\u201d she added. \nThe mayor said the city government will come up with a new executive order to turn the Davao City Peace Committee (DC PEACE) into an advisory council called, Davao City Advisory Committee for Peace and Development (DC PEACE-DEV) that will continue to engage with the community. \nThe first area mentioned by the mayor was in Paquibato district where the presence of NPA fighters was noted. \n\u201cWe acknowledged that the communities have issues with regards to government services so what we want to do is ask the community themselves what their needs and problems are,\u201d Duterte-Carpio said. \nIrene Santiago, DC Peace technical consultant said they will hold a strategic planning on Friday, December 8 to lay down the timeline for the conduct of \u201cpeace tables\u201d in communities within six months to one year. \nLawyer Elisa Lapi\u00f1a of the City Legal Office, who sits as a member of the DC-PEACE said the team will be going to a community on December 20. \nPresident Duterte signed the proclamation declaring the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and the NPA as identified terrorist organizations pursuant to Republic Act No. 10168, or the Terrorism Financing Prevention and Suppression Act of 2002. \nThe law \u201ccriminalizes the financing of terrorism and dealing with property or funds of designated persons/organizations, and prevents and suppresses the commission of said offenses through freezing and forfeiture of the property or funds of said designations persons/organizations, among others.\u201d \nWhat went before \nTo push for localized talks with NPA commanders, Duterte-Carpio signed on September 12, Executive Order No. 34 to create the Davao City Local Peace Committee or the DC-Peace to pursue peace negotiations with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP). \nAccording to the EO, the DC-Peace will serve the following functions: 1) serve as the negotiating arm of the peace promotion in the city; 2) formulation and/or review of all terms, provisions, and political solutions or settlements proposed by the parties; 3) recommend and establish negotiated political settlement with armed groups; and 4) perform acts and duties related to the intents of the Committee. \nHowever, prior to the termination of talks, the CPP has already rejected the idea of conducting localized peace talks. The CPP said the government only wants to push for the surrender of the NPA fighters promising them with housing and livelihood. \nIt said the move to conduct peace negotiations in the locality only wants to \u201cdivide\u201d revolutionary forces. \n\u201cThe Duterte regime is wasting time and the people\u2019s money in setting-up these useless local peace committees which will go nowhere and achieve nothing,\u201d it said in a statement on November 2. \nResume talks \nBishop Felixberto Calang, convener of the Sowing the Seeds of Peace Mindanao said the creation of the DC PEACE shows the sincerity of Mayor Duterte-Carpio in achieving peace in Davao City. \nBut Calang, who was among the independent observers during the previous rounds of formal talks between the NDFP and the Philippine government, said localized peace talks in the community \u201cdo not resolve the bigger picture.\u201d \n\u201cPeace talks aims to reform, if not transform oppressive and exploitative systems,\u201d Calang said. \nCalang, meanwhile, asked President Duterte to \u201cre-study his options.\u201d \n\u201cI would like to sincerely ask the president to reconsider the resumption of the talks because there is no other viable means to do it than the continuation of the peace negotiations,\u201d he said.

He was issued a field-appearance ticket for misdemeanor marijuana possession, with two other individuals, and posted a $100 cash bail.\nThe violation in New York is defined as public consumption of marijuana in any amount or possession of the substance between 25 grams and two ounces. It is considered a Class B misdemeanor and punishable by up to three months in jail.\nPlumlee may have to do community service as part of the agreement to dismiss the charge.\nThe Hawks acquired Plumlee in June as part of a trade with the Hornets. The Hawks sent center Dwight Howard and the No. 31 pick in the 2017 draft to Charlotte for Plumlee, guard Marco Belinelli and the No. 41 pick in the 2017 draft.\nPlumlee missed the Hawks\u0092 first 19 games after suffering a quad injury during the preseason. He has appeared in four games, including starts in the past two games following injuries to Dewayne Dedmon and John Collins. He is averaging 1.8 points and 3.8 rebounds in 13.5 minutes.\n Marijuana charge against Miles Plumlee dismissed\nAuthor: Chris Vivlamore\nContact: Contact the AJC | How to contact The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\nPhoto Credit: Getty Images\nWebsite: MyAJC.com - What's really going on in Atlanta | Atlanta news", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.myajc.com/", "http://www.myajc.com/sports/basketball/marijuana-charge-against-miles-plumlee-dismissed/kWtkqeFgULmW71z9U8tF3J/", "http://www.myajc.com/contact-us/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:02.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ed48320a1c968ed95e346f75a6d6a1e2fc802d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbfxqjHOI.PSw2otoqPflljKqcz6RaH_LAmrFfnUZMhf0F8SvuGh0lepGqWnolNE1hp6PN_140QTFHjeiePtfWLMxKOGW8dAsnQ--", "site_full": "www.expedia.nl", "site": "expedia.nl", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.nl/Almancil-Hotels.d182217.Reisgids-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hotels in Almancil | Betaal met iDEAL op Expedia.nl", "title": "Four Seasons Country Club:", "title_full": "Four Seasons Country Club: voorzieningen en recensies | Expedia.nl", "published": "2014-08-26T21:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 44331, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fc8a8c656d72847ada6c3d36aff2fb7f628acc7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbfxqjHOI.PSw2otoqPflljKqcz6RaH_LAmrFfnUZMhf0F8SvuGh0lepGqWnolNE1hp6PN_140QTFHjeiePtfWLOSAPuBTN37c.JB_BXUD6FvokxMgOPSHvd65W8WmWkXpQ--", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-19T19:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Great place golf courses and people.

WHAT IS THE BALLON D'OR? \nThe Ballon d'Or is an annual award presented by the magazine France Football to the best men's footballer of the year based on voting by journalists. \nBetween and 2010 and 2015, it was merged with FIFA's own World Player of the Year award and became the most high-profile individual honour attainable as a result. \nThat agreement between France Football and FIFA ended in 2016, however, with the world governing body reintroducing their own, separate prize at the annual 'The Best' FIFA Football Awards. \nFrance Football will continue to run the Ballon d'Or, however, and it retains a degree of prestige having been first given out in 1956. \nInitially an award for European footballers, non-Europeans playing in the continent's leagues became eligible in 1995 before the honour went completely global in 2007. WHEN WILL THE 2017 BALLON D'OR BE ANNOUNCED? \nThe winner of the Ballon d'Or for 2017 will be announced on December 7 at 18:45 GMT (13:45 ET). \nThe December edition of France Football , which features the winner on the cover, will then be released on December 8. \nThe Ballon d'Or ceremony will be presented by former France star David Ginola and broadcast on French sports channel L'Equipe . \nThere is not currently any sign of the event being broadcast on television in the UK or the US. WHO IS THE FAVOURITE? \nRonaldo is the heavy favourite to win the Ballon d'Or for the second year in a row, matching Messi's leading total of five overall. \nThe Portuguese's victory at 'The Best' FIFA Football Awards does not guarantee he will pick up a second honour here, but given both follow a similar voting process it is very likely. WHAT IS THE FULL SHORTLIST? \nWith seven nominees, Real Madrid are the most heavily represented club. Karim Benzema, Isco, Toni Kroos, Marcelo, Luka Modric and Sergio Ramos join Ronaldo on the shortlist. \nBarcelona have only two contenders this year in Messi and Luis Suarez, which is fewer than Paris Saint-Germain's three (Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappe). Article continues below \nThere are seven players up for the award from the Premier League, with Chelsea (Eden Hazard and N'Golo Kante) and Liverpool (Sadio Mane and Philippe Coutinho) leading the way with two nominees each. \nThe full list of nominees is as follows: Player", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name":

Nothing new there!\nJust their usual divisive hate-filled comments.\nIt is all the foreigners' fault, everything is their fault.\nEven if it is not, the RWR will invent 'anecdotes' to illustrate their bigotry. Click to expand... The way I see it, there are 2 sides to this.\nThe Brexit leave campaign was founded to a large extent on migration as a root cause. Which is wrong, the UK needs foreign workers for many sectors of the economy which cant grow without it. (ignoring the arguments at this point regarding MNC using cheap labour to grow their business). Certainly the population increase has added to public service and infrastructure pressures which cant be financed by the tax revenues from migrant wages. However that isnt the fault of the foreign workers.\nHowever, population increase, problems with illegal immigrants, pressures on public services, pressures on social housing and private rentals are real issues. If concerns like these are raised and the response all the time is 'well you are just expressing your hatred of foreigners', then nobody can move forward. What is happening is that communities are suffering, but if people arent allowed to have a proper discussion about it without being called racist, it will move the discussion to the far right who will feed into the frustration and grow their support.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:03.024+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15085825, "moreResultsAvailable": 15085725, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512641583024&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 171}
