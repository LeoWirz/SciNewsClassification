Battletech is a damage race, pure and simple, though it's complicated by all those situational factors. PPCs let you get ahead in raw damage with higher alphas, but getting closer to (or into) heat neutral with Large Lasers and extra heat sinks gives you smoother DPT. My style of play tends toward trying to keep up maximum weapons fire turn over turn, so consistent DPT appeals to me more than an alpha that's 20-30 points higher (2-3 weapons), but then has to juggle or drop 50 points or more off of a salvo to manage heat. Once you take into consideration that not every shot is a hit, firing more often is going to lead to an overall higher DPT.\nThat said, the death spiral nature of damage complicates this even more. Like you state, if you can get a crippling set of alpha strikes off on the first turn of the engagement, that's certainly going to do more for your team that smoothly chipping down the target over 2-3 turns (where it gets opportunities to shoot back).\nHonestly though, if you don't care about salvage, the best and safest bet (based on my experience in the beta) is going Spotter + Indirect LRMs all day, every day. Make it rain, my friends. If your target never fires back, you never take damage.\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JXUBxMxP0QndjQUEnTwTxOkfKmx8kWNvuc-FUtbSz_23_DAhGKe7W9spFKLXAtkpTBqM8Dt6kQrv-rS69Hi3FheL3fays2xTeVUvWR7g5UyLHnFA0frGk1BC12GYdOSRn9lbaJB-uH0htiLPJMrc9cSRsIgk5Dx7jg9K8rJVfG43lkeAWxTgcolNscW9KO2UZjKT8GMbYAFgFvu2TaMoLH8LBA5p2pm6VNYRsQK3QGjCsze1TOv2yIbCazmDwCHmjiQxNDf6LHP35msyiXo3CxuWs9Y8DQvJjvj10kWaspRNlWHKjS5w9Y0KLuIkhQKOxgaDziG290v4zBmTi-i7OfDz-foqIqKzC9wTbn9i_uU87GRitmrNAJdzRRsaTW5VQu_XX_5gCN8XCoNyu5RWWVGTsjJuyezz1_NpFa903Uj2TnFqnL1wJ-RZiFAAd2Bdut-G1pdQtdQihsq2dx_BjtmtGC3KZRyylO1t2c12dhfb0rStq4v8", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/657/nIHDGRAF65HZL.jpg", "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/userpics/089/nBS8ZZR73LWHL.png"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:45.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d5a5d6713f26e3edd5516aa0636ab04a2e57e585", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMlxgxZF9fwmq77tvt4Ptc78Smi5Te05MlHw2macxs07VeoxSbsDWF5aLf56VqvxyW2Yw2CaGMdGCOtVovROPx3OegnyRtnUPwXW8ZcPCoaYo0UmcxJzcgwGVQ7ouH5I0MNX2bmBUj5cXt", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "[MechWarrior/BATTLETECH] THURSDAY (DEC-07) OOSIK END-OF-YEAR BASH!

Huge study putting 3-D scans to the test", "text": "December 7, 2017 admin Technology 0 WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A better mammogram? Increasingly women are asked if they want a 3-D mammogram instead of the regular X-ray \u2013 and now U.S. health officials are starting a huge study to tell if the newer, sometimes pricier choice really improves screening for breast cancer. It\u2019s the latest dilemma in a field that already vexes women with conflicting guidelines on when to get checked: Starting at age 40, 45 or 50? Annually or every other year? The issue: Mammograms can save lives if they catch aggressive breast cancers early. But they also can harm through frequent false alarms and by spotting tumors that grow so slowly they never would have posed a threat \u2013 overdiagnosis that means some women undergo unneeded treatment. That trade-off is a key question as doctors begin recruiting 165,000 women nationally to compare potentially more beneficial 3-D mammograms \u2013 known scientifically as \u201ctomosynthesis\u201d\u2013 with standard two-dimensional digital mammography. The 3-D mammograms have been marketed as being able to find more cancers. \u201cBut the idea isn\u2019t so much finding more cancers as finding the cancers that are going to be life-threatening,\u201d said Dr. Worta McCaskill-Stevens of the National Cancer Institute, which is funding the new research to tell whether the 3-D scans truly pinpoint the tumors that matter most. It\u2019s one of the largest randomized trials of mammography in decades, and scientists designed the research to do more than answer that key 3-D question. They hope the findings also, eventually, will help clear some of the confusion surrounding best screening practices. \u201cThe most important thing about this study is that it\u2019s moving us to individualized screening as opposed to what we have now, which is one-size-fits-all screening,\u201d predicted study chair Dr. Etta Pisano, a radiologist at Boston\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \u201cWe are going to have a much better understanding of how to screen women so that we do the least amount of harm.\u201d WHO NEEDS A MAMMOGRAM? That depends on whom you ask. Guidelines vary for women at average risk of breast cancer. (Those at increased risk, because of family history or genetics, already get different advice.) The American College of Radiology recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40. The American Cancer Society urges annual checks starting at 45 and switching to every other year at 55, although it says women 40 to 44 still can opt for a mammogram. And the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory group, recommends starting at age 50, with mammograms every other year. It, too, says 40-somethings can choose earlier screening. WHAT ABOUT 3-D MAMMOGRAMS? Standard mammograms take X-rays from two sides of the breast. With tomosynthesis, additional X-rays are taken at different angles \u2013 not truly three-dimensional but a computer compiles them into a 3-D-like image. First approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011, they\u2019re not yet standard in part because of questions that the new study aims to answer. Some studies have found tomosynthesis detects more cancer with fewer false alarms; they\u2019re often advertised as particularly useful for younger women\u2019s dense breasts. HOW TO DECIDE? Understand that mammograms come with pros and cons, and weigh them, said Dr. Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society\u2019s chief medical officer. Breast cancer is far less common at age 40 than at age 50 and beyond. After menopause, tumors tend to grow more slowly and women\u2019s breast tissue becomes less dense and easier for mammograms to provide a clearer image. Consider: For every 1,000 women screened every other year until their 70s, starting at 40 instead of 50 would prevent one additional death \u2013 but create 576 more false alarms and 58 extra unneeded biopsies, the task force estimated. Also, two extra women would be treated for tumors that never would have become life-threatening \u2013 that overdiagnosis problem. As for what type to choose, some insurers, including Medicare, cover the 3-D version, and a small number of states mandate coverage. Other insurers may require women to pay $50 to $100 more out of pocket. Whoever ultimately pays, extra time to analyze the scans adds to the cost. THE NEW STUDY About 100 mammography clinics across the U.S., and a few in Canada, will enroll healthy women ages 45 to 74 who already are planning to get a routine mammogram. They\u2019ll be randomly assigned to get either the regular or 3-D version for five years. Most will be screened annually but post-menopausal women who don\u2019t have certain cancer risk factors will be screened every other year. Researchers will track every woman\u2019s results including samples from biopsies plus genetic and other tests, as well as how any cancer patients fare.

Battletech is a damage race, pure and simple, though it's complicated by all those situational factors. PPCs let you get ahead in raw damage with higher alphas, but getting closer to (or into) heat neutral with Large Lasers and extra heat sinks gives you smoother DPT. My style of play tends toward trying to keep up maximum weapons fire turn over turn, so consistent DPT appeals to me more than an alpha that's 20-30 points higher (2-3 weapons), but then has to juggle or drop 50 points or more off of a salvo to manage heat. Once you take into consideration that not every shot is a hit, firing more often is going to lead to an overall higher DPT.\nThat said, the death spiral nature of damage complicates this even more. Like you state, if you can get a crippling set of alpha strikes off on the first turn of the engagement, that's certainly going to do more for your team that smoothly chipping down the target over 2-3 turns (where it gets opportunities to shoot back).\nHonestly though, if you don't care about salvage, the best and safest bet (based on my experience in the beta) is going Spotter + Indirect LRMs all day, every day. Make it rain, my friends. If your target never fires back, you never take damage.\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nSo, for reference sake, I was expecting something more along the lines of two lances, each with a light, medium, heavy, and assault (read: Awesome), with the only difference being the AI had stock builds and the player had swapped out the PPCs for LLas, with mostly HS filling the difference, but with an occasional ton of armor here or there.\n'mechs like the Panther, imo, benefit from this swap, since it wants to be a little bit closer range, while mechs like the Griffin probably like the PPC better for distance, but the LLas is arguably more useful with no min range. A 'mech like the Cataphract -1X variant probably only likes the LLas a little bit, for the better heat efficiency (and the small benefit of both main guns having identical ranges). The Catapult -K2 on the other hand might like the swap (especially if you restore JJets with the weight), and may end up running close to heat neutral just from the gun swap, and definitely works better up close without the min range issue. The Awesome is gonna love swapping to LLas so much that it doesn't even need all the extra weight for HS and can afford to toss on more armor and still have plenty of weight for extra HS.\nThis is kinda what I originally had in mind (although I loved seeing the Hunchie and thought it was neat how the PPCs were slung under the arm).\ne: I feel like builds where the PPC excels are gonna be builds that have one PPC, but 4+ MLas, where you can turn one or two off and become heat neutral, when you need to. That's where you want to have a strong alpha.\nTox on December 6 Wishlists!

I hope that pans out in the full version.\nGiven that\u2019s I\u2019m still waiting for community warfare I\u2019ll believe any of that when i see it.

He packed his bag with his most treasured possessions before going to bed: the 1 terabyte hard drive with his evidence against the Islamic State group, an orange notebook half-filled with notes on Ottoman history, and, a keepsake, the first book from Amazon delivered to Mosul. He passed the night in despair, imagining all the ways he could die, and the moment he would leave his mother and his city. He had spent nearly his entire life in this home, with his five brothers and five sisters. He woke his mother in her bedroom on the ground floor. \u201cI am leaving,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cI am leaving,\u201d was all he could say. He couldn\u2019t endanger her by telling her anything more. In truth, since the IS had invaded his city, he\u2019d lived a life about which she was totally unaware. He felt her eyes on the back of his neck, and headed to the waiting Chevrolet. He didn\u2019t look back. For nearly two years, he\u2019d wandered the streets of occupied Mosul, chatting with shopkeepers and Islamic State fighters, visiting friends who worked at the hospital, swapping scraps of information. He grew out his hair and his beard and wore the shortened trousers required by IS. He forced himself to witness the beheadings and deaths by stoning, so he could hear the killers call out the names of the condemned and their supposed crimes. He wasn\u2019t a spy. He was an undercover historian and blogger . As IS turned the city he loved into a fundamentalist bastion, he decided he would show the world how the extremists had distorted its true nature, how they were trying to rewrite the past and forge a brutal Sunni-only future for a city that had once welcomed many faiths. He knew that if he was caught he too would be executed. \u201cI am writing this for the history , because I know this will end. People will return, life will go back to normal,\u201d is how he explained the blog that was his conduit to the citizens of Mosul and the world beyond. \u201cAfter many years, there will be people who will study what happened. The city deserves to have something written to defend the city and tell the truth, because they say that when the war begins, the first victim is the truth.\u201d He called himself Mosul Eye . He made a promise to himself in those first few days: Trust no one, document everything. Neither family, friends nor the Islamic State group could identify him. His readership grew by the thousands every month. And now, he was running for his life. But it would mean passing through one Islamic State checkpoint after another, on the odds that the extremists wouldn\u2019t stop him, wouldn\u2019t find the hard drive that contained evidence of IS atrocities, the names of its collaborators and fighters, and all the evidence that its bearer was the man they\u2019d been trying to silence since they first swept in. The weight of months and years of anonymity were crushing him. He missed his name. \u2014 From the beginning, Mosul Eye wrote simultaneously as a witness and a historian. Born in the midst of the Iran-Iraq war in 1986, he had come of age during a second war, when Saddam Hussein fell and the Americans took over. At 17, he remembers going to a meeting of extremists at the mosque and hearing them talk about fighting the crusaders. \u201cI should be honest, I didn\u2019t understand.\u201d As for the Americans, whose language he already spoke haltingly, he couldn\u2019t fathom why they would come all the way from the United States to Mosul. He thought studying history would give him the answers. The men in black came from the north, cutting across his neighborhood in brand new trucks, the best all-terrain Toyotas money could buy. He had seen jihadis before in Mosul and at first figured these men would fade away like the rest. But in the midst of pitched fighting, the extremists found the time to run down about 70 assassination targets and kill them all, hanging enormous banners announcing their arrival in June 2014. By then a newly minted teacher, the historian attended a staff meeting at Mosul University, where the conquerors explained the Islamic State education system, how all classes would be based upon the strictest interpretation of the Quran. To a man who had been accused of secularism during his master\u2019s thesis defense just the year before, it felt like the end of his career. In those first few days, he wrote observations about the Islamic State group on his personal Facebook page \u2013 until a friend warned that he risked being killed. With the smell of battle still in the air, he wandered the streets, puzzling over its transformation into a city at war. He returned to find his family weeping. The smell of smoke and gunfire permeated the home. On June 18, 2014, a week after the city fell, Mosul Eye was born . \u201cMy job as a historian requires an unbiased approach which I am going to adhere to and keep my personal opinion to myself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI will only communicate the facts I see.\u201d By day, he chatted with Islamic State fighters and vendors, and observed. Always observed. By night, he wrote in his native Arabic and fluent English on a WordPress blog and later on Facebook and Twitter. The city turned dark, and Mosul Eye became one of the outside world\u2019s main sources of news about the Islamic State fighters, their atrocities and their transformation of the city into a grotesque shadow of itself. The things IS wanted kept secret went to the heart of its brutal rule. \u201cThey were organized as a killing machine. They are thirsty (for) blood and money and women.\u201d He attended Friday sermons with feigned enthusiasm. He collected and posted propaganda leaflets, including one on July 27, 2014, that claimed the Islamic State leader was a descendent of the Prophet Mohammed\u2019s daughter. Back home, writing on his blog in his other, secret identity, he decried the leaflet as a blatant attempt \u201cto distort history\u201d to justify the fanatics\u2019 actions. He drank glass after glass of tea at the hospital, talking to people who worked there. Much of the information he collected went up online. Other details he kept in his computer, for fear they would give away his identity. Someday, he told himself, he would write Mosul\u2019s history using these documents. The most sensitive information initially came from two old friends: one a doctor and the other a high school dropout who embraced Islamic State\u2019s extreme interpretation of religion. He was a taxi driver who like many others in Mosul had been detained by a Shiite militia in 2008 and still burned with resentment. He swiftly joined an intelligence unit in Mosul, becoming \u201cone of the monsters of ISIS\u201d\u2013 and couldn\u2019t resist bragging about his insider knowledge. Once he corroborated the details and masked the sources, Mosul Eye put it out for the world to see. He sometimes included photos of the fighters and commanders, complete with biographies pieced together over days of surreptitious gathering of bits and pieces of information during the course of his normal life \u2013 that of an out-of-work scholar living at home with his family. \u201cI used the two characters, the two personalities to serve each other,\u201d he said. He would chat up market vendors and bored checkpoint guards for new leads. He took on other identities as well on Facebook. Although the names were clearly fake, the characters started to take on a life of their own. One was named Mouris Milton whom he came to believe was an even better version of himself \u2013 funny, knowledgeable. Another was Ibn al-Athir al-Mawsilli, a coldly logical historian. International media picked up on Mosul Eye from the first days, starting with an online question-and-answer with a German newspaper. The anonymous writer gave periodic written interviews in English over the years. Sometimes, journalists quoted his blog and called it an interview. In October 2016, he spoke by phone with the New Yorker for a profile but still kept his identity masked. Intelligence agencies made contact as well and he rebuffed them each time. \u201cI am not a spy or a journalist,\u201d he would say. \u201cI tell them this: If you want the information, it\u2019s published and it\u2019s public for free. Take it.\u201d First the Islamic State group compiled lists of women accused of prostitution, he said, stoning or shooting around 500 in the initial months. Then it went after men accused of being gay, flinging them off tall buildings. Shiites, Christians and Yazidis fled from a city once proud of its multiple religious. When the only Mosul residents left were fellow Sunnis, they too were not spared, according to the catalog of horrors that is Mosul Eye\u2019s daily report. He detailed the deaths and whippings, for spying and apostasy, for failing to attend prayers, for overdue taxes. The blog attracted the attention of the fanatics, who posted death threats in the comments section. \u2014 Less than a year into their rule, in March 2015, he nearly cracked. IS executed a 14-year-old in front of a crowd; 12 people were arrested for selling and smoking cigarettes, and some of them flogged publicly. Seeing few alternatives, young men from Mosul were joining up by the dozens. The sight of a fanatic severing the hand of a child accused of stealing unmoored him. The man told the boy that his hand was a gift of repentance to God before serenely slicing it away. It was too much. Mosul Eye was done. He defied the dress requirements, cut his hair short, shaved his beard and pulled on a bright red crewneck sweater. He persuaded his closest friend to join him. \u201cI decided to die.\u201d The sun shining, they drove to the banks of the Tigris blasting forbidden music from the car. They spread a scrap of rug over a stone outcropping and shared a carafe of tea. Mosul Eye lit a cigarette, heedless of a handful of other people picnicking nearby. \u201cI was so tired of worrying about myself, my family, my brothers. I am not alive to worry, but I am alive to live this life. I thought: I am done.\u201d He planned it as a sort of last supper, a final joyful day to end all days. He assumed he would be spotted, arrested, tortured. The tea was the best he had ever tasted. Somehow, incredibly, his crimes went unnoticed. He went home. \u201cAt that moment I felt like I was given a new life.\u201d He grew out his hair and beard again, put the shortened trousers back on. And, for the remainder of his time in Mosul, smoked and listened to music in his room with the curtains drawn and the lights off. His computer screen and the tip of his cigarette glowed as he wrote in the dark. The next month, he slipped up. His friend the ex-taxi driver told him about an airstrike that had just killed multiple high-level Islamic State commanders, destroying a giant weapons cache. Elated, Mosul Eye dashed home to post it online. He hit \u201cpublish\u201d and then, minutes later, realized his mistake. The information could have come from only one person. He trashed the post and spent a sleepless night. \u201cIt\u2019s like a death game and one mistake could finish your life.\u201d For a week, he went dark. Then he invited his friend to meet at a restaurant. They ate spicy chicken, an unemployed teacher and the gun-toting ex-taxi driver talking again about their city and their lives. His cover was not blown. The historian went back online. Alongside the blog, he kept meticulous records \u2013 information too dangerous to share. His computer hard drive filled with death, filed according to date, cause of death, perpetrator, neighborhood and ethnicity. Accompanying each spreadsheet entry was a separate file with observations from each day. \u201cISIS is forcing abortions and tubal ligation surgeries on Yazidi women,\u201d he wrote in unpublished notes from January 2015. A doctor told him there had been between 50 and 60 forced abortions and a dozen Yazidi girls younger than 15 died of injuries from repeated rapes. April 19, 2015: \u201cThe forensics department received the bodies of 23 ISIS militants killed in Baiji. They had no shrapnel, no bullets, no explosives and the cause of death does not seem to be explosion. It is like nothing happened to the bodies. A medical source believes they were exposed to poison gas.\u201d July 7, 2015: \u201c43 citizens were executed in different places, this time by gunfire, which is unusual because they were previously beheadings. A source inside ISIS said that 13 of those who were executed are fighters and they tried to flee ..\u201d He noted a flurry of security on days when the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, seemed to be in town. Many in Iraq, especially those who supported the Shiite-dominated leadership in Baghdad, blamed Mosul for its own fate. Mosul Eye freely acknowledged that some residents at first believed the new conquerors could only be an improvement over the heavy-handed government and the soldiers who fled with hardly a backward glance at the city they were supposed to defend. But he also wrote publicly and privately \u2013 of the suffering among citizens who refused to join the group. He was fighting on two fronts: \u201cOne against ISIS, and the other against the rumors. Trying to protect the face of Mosul, the soul of Mosul.\u201d He tested out different voices, implying one day that he was Christian, another that he was Muslim. Sometimes he indicated he was gone, other times that he was still in the city. \u201cI couldn\u2019t trust anyone,\u201d he said. In his mind, he left Mosul a thousand times, but always found reasons to stay: his mother, his nieces and nephews, his mission. But finally, he had to go. \u201cI had to run away with the proof that will protect Mosul for years to come, and to at least be loyal to the people who were killed in the city.\u201d And he did not want to become another casualty of the monsters. \u201cI think I deserve life, deserve to be alive.\u201d A smuggler, persuaded by $1,000 and the assurances of a mutual acquaintance, agreed to get him out. He was leaving the next day. Mosul Eye had no time to reflect, no time to change his mind. He returned home and began transferring the contents of his computer to the hard drive. He pulled out the orange notebook with the hand-drawn map of Mosul on the cover and the outlines of what he hoped would one day be his doctoral dissertation. Into the bag went \u201cFather Bombo\u2019s Pilgrimage to Mecca,\u201d an obscure American satirical novel from 1770 that he had ordered from Amazon via a new shop that was the only place in town to order from abroad online. It was time to leave. He wanted to make sure his mother would never have to watch the capture and killing of Mosul Eye. On Dec. 15, 2015 he left Mosul, driving with the smuggler to the outskirts of Raqqa, a pickup point that alarmed him. From there he and other Iraqis and Syrians were picked up by a second set of smugglers and driven by convoy to Turkey. They had no trouble crossing the border. \u2014 In Turkey, Mosul Eye kept at it: via WhatsApp and Viber, from Facebook messages and long conversations with friends and relatives who had contacts within IS. From hundreds of kilometers away, his life remained consumed by events in Mosul. By mid-2016, deaths were piling up faster than he could document. The IS and airstrikes were taking a bloody toll on residents. His records grew haphazard, and he turned to Twitter to document the atrocities. In February 2017, he received asylum in Europe with the aid of an organization that learned his backstory. He continued to track the airstrikes and Islamic State killings He mapped the airstrikes as they closed in on his family, pleading with his older brother to leave his home in West Mosul. Ahmed, 36, died days later when shrapnel from a mortar strike pierced his heart, leaving behind four young children. It was only then that Mosul Eye revealed his secret to a younger brother \u2013 who was proud to learn the anonymous historian he had been reading for so long was his brother. \u201cPeople in Mosul had lost hope and confidence in politicians, in everything,\u201d his brother said. Mosul Eye \u201cmanaged to show that it\u2019s possible to change the situation in the city and bring it back to life.\u201d As the Old City crumbled, Mosul Eye sent coordinates and phone numbers for homes filled with civilians to a BBC journalist who was covering the battle, trying to get the attention of someone in the coalition command. He believes he saved lives. Then, with his beloved Old City destroyed, Mosul Eye launched a fundraiser to rebuild the city\u2019s libraries because the extremists had burned all the books. None of his volunteers knew his identity. An activist who helped co-found a \u2018Women of Mosul\u2019 Facebook group with Mosul Eye describes him as a \u201cspiritual leader\u201d for the city\u2019s secular-minded. \u201cHe was telling us about the day-to-day events under ISIS and we were following closely with excitement as if we were watching a movie. Sometimes he went through hard times and we used to encourage him. He won the people\u2019s trust and we became very curious to know his real personality,\u201d said the activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she believed she was still in danger. From a distance, finally writing his dissertation on 19th century Mosul history in the safety of a European city, he continued to write as Mosul Eye and organize cultural events and fundraisers from afar \u2013 even after Mosul was liberated. The double life consumed him, sapped energy he\u2019d rather use for the doctoral dissertation and for helping Mosul rebuild. And it hurt when someone asked the young Iraqi why he didn\u2019t do more to help his people. He desperately wanted his mother to know all that he had done. He felt barely real, with so many people knowing him by false identities: 293,000 followers on Facebook, 37,000 on WordPress and 23,400 on Twitter. In hours of conversation with The Associated Press, he agonized over when and how to end the anonymity that plagued him. He did not want to be a virtual character anymore.

But what about casual fans outside SEC, ACC and Big 12 country? With the Pac-12 and Big Ten not represented in the four-team playoff, a TV sports viewership analyst said interest could be tempered on the West Coast, upper Midwest and Northeast. The campuses of Clemson, Georgia and Alabama are in close proximity in the Southeast \u2013 Clemson and Georgia are just 75 miles apart. Oklahoma is the outlier, a good day\u2019s drive west of Alabama. \u201cI think it\u2019s too regional this year,\u201d said Jon Lewis, editor of Sports Media Watch. \u201cThat hurts in every sport \u2013 unless it\u2019s the Super Bowl.\u201d That said, Lewis expects a potential loss of viewership could be offset because the semifinals will be played on New Year\u2019s Day, the traditional college football holiday. The last two years the semifinals were on New Year\u2019s Eve, when the games competed with parties and other celebrations. An additional boost might come from the Alabama-Clemson semifinal in the Sugar Bowl being a rematch of the last two national championship games. But, Lewis said, \u201cI still think the numbers are going to be well short of the first year of the playoff.\u201d In 2015, the inaugural playoff semifinals matching Oregon-Florida State and Ohio State-Alabama each drew better than 28 million viewers on ESPN, according to the Nielsen company. The Oregon-Ohio State title game had 33.4 million. Viewership the last two years ranged from 15.5 million to 19.8 million for the New Year\u2019s Eve semifinals, and the Clemson-Alabama title games drew 26.7 million in 2016 and 26 million in 2017. Los Angeles sports radio host Petros Papadakis acknowledged the regional flavor of the playoff \u2013\u201cI hope Oklahoma can at least strike a blow for the people west of the Mississippi,\u201d he joked \u2013 but said he didn\u2019t think it would put a damper on fans\u2019 enthusiasm nationally. \u201cCall me crazy, but I think we\u2019ve reached a point in our society where football fans put football on,\u201d Papadakis said. \u201cIf there is live football and it\u2019s a big game that\u2019s on, people are watching. \u2026 I really do feel like the College Football Playoff is transcendent like the Super Bowl, where people are just going to watch because it\u2019s championship-level football.\u201d Still, Lewis said it can\u2019t be overlooked that much of the nation is left with no rooting interest. He noted the Big Ten and Pac-12 have larger geographic footprints (never mind the Big 12\u2019s eastern outpost of West Virginia) and there is some overlap between the SEC and ACC. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have the SEC represented. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s good to have two SEC teams represented,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cAnd when you talk about the conferences, the Big 12, ACC and SEC are very similar in terms of their makeup, in terms of their regions. You don\u2019t want it to be too regional.\u201d An interesting test will be the Rose Bowl, where the traditional Big Ten-Pac-12 matchup gives way to the playoff semifinal between Oklahoma and Georgia. Papadakis said the Rose Bowl obviously would have more local interest if Southern California or UCLA were participating, but the fact the game is a playoff makes it intriguing. \u201cThe key for the Rose Bowl is that they\u2019re big, blue-blooded traditional college football programs,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s a big blue blood, people will come out to Los Angeles and the game will feel big. There are so many transplants in LA, and I would argue there are more Georgia and Oklahoma people in this town than Oregon people who would come to the game.\u201d Brandon Heideman, who bartends at The Lodge Sports Grille in Seattle, said there was standing-room only at his establishment last year when the hometown Washington Huskies were in the playoff. The absence of a Pac-12 team in this year\u2019s playoff, let alone the Huskies, probably will temper enthusiasm. \u201cAs long as someone in the Pac-12 is playing in a game, we\u2019re very busy,\u201d Heideman said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have more people than usual in here for the playoff, but it won\u2019t be like it was last year.\u201d Ali Jones, a bartender at Bunkers Sports Bar and Grill in Dayton, Ohio, said she and her patrons are disappointed Ohio State didn\u2019t make the final four. Still, she expects a full house for the semifinals and the Jan. 8 final and that folks probably will be pulling for Oklahoma, which beat the Buckeyes in the regular season. What about Alabama, the team that edged out the Buckeyes for a playoff spot? \u201cWe won\u2019t be rolling any Tides over here,\u201d Jones said. \u2014", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hardcore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "papadakis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heideman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ali jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petros papadakis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandon heideman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cfp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sports", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bunkers sports bar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "college football playoff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the lodge sports grille", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buckeyes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "espn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huskies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clemson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington huskies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose bowl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clemson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dayton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "midwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio state-alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:46.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a88798b08ac5d75e6e18c50c13f75742cd8cfe9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwrlKEagknWD2k4gGKhKwFCf27y01aD_KnXgarDqIF1_VCPnU7.LXZ_0p4e3iWK2KI-", "site_full": "forums.d2jsp.org", "site": "d2jsp.org", "site_section": "http://forums.d2jsp.org/forum.php?f=147", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Legit Dueling - d2jsp Forum", "title": "Nvn Gm", "title_full": "Nvn Gm - d2jsp Topic", "published": "2017-12-06T21:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.444, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46006, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8ae09c11761ddf39c73173536c0559fc884633ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwrlKEagknWD2k4gGKhKwFCf27y01aD_KnXgarDqIF1_VCPnU7.LXZ_wgf2cTTuCQqldIxBZtMBqg--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Durkin", "published": "2017-12-07T05:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "NvN anyone?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:46.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1eeb7c58537f53c82d41127e516448cf5cbfe426", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT96GyASeBlRrKKLRPb_4joAp9BDZct0R0nAlvwvq0.BI9GzR88X3UptYZMNpHL3ooCt29k8J5ogQ--", "site_full": "www.kvraudio.com", "site": "kvraudio.com", "site_section": "http://www.kvraudio.com/forum/feed.php?f=1", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "KVR Forum - Instruments", "title": "Re: Sampletank 4: AR new features announced (in: Instruments)", "title_full": "Re: Sampletank 4: AR new features announced (in: Instruments)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://static.kvraudio.com/i/b/kvraudio-300x300-grey-eeeeee.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29467, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1eeb7c58537f53c82d41127e516448cf5cbfe426", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT96GyASeBlRrKKLRPb_4joAp9BDZct0R0nAlvwvq0.BI9GzR88X3UptYZMNpHL3ooCt29k8J5ogQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tj Shredder", "published": "2017-12-07T11:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Re: Sampletank 4: AR new features announced (in: Instruments)", "text": "8271 posts since 4 Feb, 2004 by braj ;

Noah Berger \u2014 The Associated Press By Mark Gomez and Julia Prodis Sulek, Bay Area News Group Posted: # Comments A firefighter mops up at a home consumed by a wildfire in the Bel Air district of Los Angeles on Wednesday. Jae C. Hong \u2014 The Associated Press \nEven before the dramatic Southern California wildfires began their harrowing path this week, California was already experiencing its deadliest and most destructive fire season ever. \nAnd it\u2019s only getting worse. \nIn Ventura and Los Angeles counties, four fires driven by the Santa Ana winds are raging just two weeks before the start of winter. By Wednesday, at least 150 homes had burned, including at least four in the star-studded enclave of Bel-Air. The flames reportedly damaged structures on media mogul Rupert Murdoch\u2019s estate and threatened the homes of other celebrities, including Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk. The Skirball Fire closed Interstate 405 for a time on Wednesday, shuttered the landmark Getty Museum, and shut down classes at UCLA and the production of several TV series, including HBO\u2019s Westworld. \nThere\u2019s no sign of letting up. Thursday \u201cis going to be the worst day with the winds,\u201d Cal Fire spokeswoman Lynne Tolmachoff said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting gusts up to or possibly worse than the North Bay fires. We are expecting gusts up to 80 mph.\u201d \nScenes of California burning are filling the airwaves just two months after the fires in Mendocino, Napa and Sonoma counties made international headlines. Also on Wednesday, state officials announced the stunning cost of insurance claims in the October fires in Northern California had topped $9 billion. Those firestorms killed 44 people, burned 8,900 structures and destroyed scores of vehicles and other personal property. \nWhile the North Bay fires alone turned 2017 into the deadliest wildfire season in state history, the Golden State is also closing in on a near-record year for acres burned. In 2008, nearly 1.6 million acres burned across the state; this year, before this week\u2019s fires, nearly 1.2 million acres had burned. \nFor Californians who welcomed one of the wettest, drought-busting winters early in 2017, the fury of the fires is startling. What\u2019s even more surreal, however, is the timing of the L.A. fires: smack in the middle of the Christmas season, with trees in living rooms and colored lights under the eaves. \nSouthern California fires in December \u201caren\u2019t unprecedented,\u201d Jan Null, meteorologist at Golden Gate Weather Services said, but \u201cgenerally, they have their biggest fires more in October and into November.\u201d \nOf the 20 most destructive fires in California history, 11 of them occurred in October, including three from this year\u2019s Northern California fires. Two were sparked in November, according to Cal Fire. None burned in December, although it\u2019s still too soon to know whether the Southern California fires have the destructive force to make the top 20 list. Advertisement \n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely potential,\u201d Cal Fire\u2019s Tolmachoff said. \nLate-season fires are \u201cbecoming more and more of the normal,\u201d she said. \u201cOur fire seasons have become longer over the past couple of decades, increased by upwards of 70 days a year.\u201d \nStill, December is unusual for such a huge, destructive fire. And there are two key factors at work: weather patterns and climate change. \nShortly after California\u2019s deadly October wildfires, the region was doused with rains, all but ending the fire season here. But the storm track avoided the southern half of the state, which has received almost no precipitation in several months. Los Angeles has received less than two-tenths of an inch of rain since May 1. \n\u201cI was driving around Mendocino and Butte counties and there\u2019s green foliage coming back,\u201d Null said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t had that yet in Southern California to any extent.\u201d \nThe entire state is not likely to receive rain any time soon. A strong ridge of high pressure parked over much of the West Coast is blocking storms and sending them north to the U.S.-Canada border, according to the National Weather Service. Federal scientists are predicting all of California will remain dry at least through Dec. 20. \nClimate change is also having effects that can only be factored over time. \n\u201cWe get high-risk, wind-driven fire seasons many years, but climate change is increasing the probability of extending it further into the fall or winter,\u201d said UC Merced professor LeRoy Westerling, a climate and fire scientist. \nBecause of California\u2019s Mediterranean climate, where a handful of storms can make up the entire rainy season, missing two or three deluges can mean the difference between a wet and dry year. \n\u201cThe timing becomes a lot more variable, too,\u201d Westerling said. \u201cIf you have three storms and not five, you might not get any in the fall.\u201d \nAnd that leads to the kinds of devastating fire conditions this week in Los Angeles. \nDuring California\u2019s five-year drought, \u201cthe winds that propel fires \u2014 both the Santa Anas in Southern California and the Diablos in the north \u2014 were not as great,\u201d Tolmachoff said. \u201cWe did get wind events, but they didn\u2019t last as long. These days we\u2019re talking about a five-day event with these Santa Anas. It\u2019s a big potential for fires to start and spread.\u201d \nAfter the drought, this past winter\u2019s record-setting rains also spurred tremendous brush growth, which died off in the summer, making for extensive, ready fire fuel. Add the gusty winds ripping through new home developments, and the conditions are ripe for devastation. \nThat\u2019s what Ventura and Los Angeles counties have been experiencing this week, as the fires have forced thousands from their homes and led to a state of emergency declaration from Gov. Jerry Brown that will pave the way for more disaster relief. As of Wednesday afternoon, officials were bracing for more damage but relieved that no one had been killed. \n\u201cThese are the days that break your heart,\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said, \u201cbut these are the days that keep us together.\u201d \nBay Area News Group wire services contributed to this report.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

One of them is the first sunday of advent. Here the  Crown Prince family decorate their several meters height Christmas three. This year we were allowed to closely follow the tradition because of video posted on the royal family's Facebook. Later, a picture taken by the Crown Princess was posted on Instagram. I have really come to love these posts very much. A few years ago, it wasn't even possible for us to dream that one day we would see something this private. Quite often we get to see from inside the walls of Amalienborg because, especially, the Crown Princess share her pictures with us. \n\nIn my family it is a tradition to decorate the tree on December 23rd; the day before we celebrate Christmas in Denmark.

(AP) \u2014 Dr. Byron Maas surveys a supply of marijuana products for dogs that lines a shelf in his veterinary clinic. They\u2019re selling well. \u201cThe \u2018Up and Moving\u2019 is for joints and for pain,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe \u2018Calm and Quiet\u2019 is for real anxious dogs, to take away that anxiety.\u201d People anxious to relieve suffering in their pets are increasingly turning to oils and powders that contain CBDs, a non-psychoactive component of marijuana. But there\u2019s little data on whether they work, or if they have harmful side effects. That\u2019s because Washington has been standing in the way of clinical trials, veterinarians and researchers say. Now, a push is underway to have barriers removed, so both pets and people can benefit. Those barriers have had more than just a chilling effect. When the federal Drug Enforcement Administration announced last year that even marijuana extracts with CBD and little or no THC \u2013 marijuana\u2019s intoxicating component \u2013 are an illegal Schedule 1 drug, the University of Pennsylvania halted its clinical trials. Colorado State University is pushing ahead. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned companies that sell marijuana products online and via pet shops and animal hospitals that they\u2019re violating laws by offering \u201cunapproved new animal drugs.\u201d The FDA threatened legal action. But, seeing potential benefits of CBDs, the American Veterinary Medical Association\u2019s policy-making body said last summer it wants the DEA to declassify marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug \u201cto facilitate research opportunities for veterinary and human medical uses.\u201d It asked the board of the national veterinarians\u2019 organization to investigate working with other stakeholders toward that goal. The board is awaiting a recommendation from two group councils. \u201cThe concern our membership has is worry about people extrapolating their own dosages, looking to medicate their pets outside the realm of the medical professional,\u201d Board Chairman Michael Whitehair said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis is an important reason for us to continue the research.\u201d Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a conservative Republican, became an unlikely champion of this push when he introduced a bill in September that would open the path for more clinical research. While Hatch said he opposes recreational marijuana use, he wants marijuana-based drugs, regulated by the FDA, produced for people with disorders. \u201cWe lack the science to support use of medical marijuana products like CBD oils, not because researchers are unwilling to do the work, but because of bureaucratic red tape and over-regulation,\u201d Hatch said. Dawn Boothe, of Auburn University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine, is waiting for federal approval to begin a study of marijuana\u2019s effects on dogs with epilepsy. The classification of marijuana products containing CBD as a Schedule 1 drug, the same category as heroin and LSD, creates a \u201cmajor, major, major, terrible roadblock\u201d for researchers, Boothe said in a phone interview. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine were studying CBDs\u2019 effects on dogs with osteoarthritis and pruritis, or itchiness, until the DEA released its policy statement. \u201cThe ambiguity in this process has really brought us to a screeching halt,\u201d said Michael DiGregorio, director of the university\u2019s clinical trials center. \u201cIt is research that needs to be done, because there are a lot of CBD products out there.\u201d When it clarified that marijuana CBD extracts are Schedule 1 drugs, the DEA said it was assigning a code number to those substances to better track them and to comply with international drug control treaties. DiGregorio complained that researchers seeking federal approval to study CBD products are told to provide certain data, but that data isn\u2019t normally available until the study is done. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the data, you can\u2019t get the registration to do the work,\u201d he said. On a recent morning, Maas took a break from seeing four-legged patients in the Bend Veterinary Clinic. A stethoscope dangling from his neck over green scrubs, Maas said his clients have reported CBDs help relieve pain, arthritis, anxiety, loss of appetite, epilepsy and inflammation in their pets. \u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s not a lot of research out there, especially on animals, on CBD compounds,\u201d Maas said. \u201cThe research is really necessary to help us understand how to actually use these compounds on our pets.\u201d Veterinarian Janet Ladyga of the Blue Sky Veterinary Clinic, also in Bend, said she doesn\u2019t recommend marijuana products because of the unknowns. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of evidence right now, so we don\u2019t know the toxicity or the safety profile \u2026 and we don\u2019t have any good evidence to show either if it\u2019s safe or efficacious,\u201d she said. The study at Colorado State University aims to provide some data. The roughly two dozen dogs in the arthritis study and the 30 in the epilepsy tests are given either CBD oil or a placebo.

I know, I know \"let them find you,\" \"try to love yourself before loving somebody else,\" and \"they will come around when you least expect it.\" I have heard all these things time and time again, but my problem is, is it me or is it just the gay community being so superficial that makes it impossible for somebody like me to find anyone?\nI like to think of myself as an attractive person, I am not trying to sound conceited but I have been told by others that I am attractive. Hell, there are even people who keep telling me, \"How is a person like you still single?\" and what makes it worse is that it is not even that I find myself attractive, but that people tell me I also have a really great personality and get along well with just about anyone that I meet.\nI am an outgoing and friendly person who tends to go that extra mile for someone (be as it may in a friendship or a relationship) and I love surrounding myself with the people that I care about the most. I used to try so hard in trying to find somebody, I had almost all of the dating apps including Grindr and Jack'd. But nobody ever talked to me or gave me the time of day, and if they did, it was either short-lived in terms of them only being interested in a fling or the inevitable catfishing (which has happened to me on more than one occasion).\nFinally, I told myself that these apps were psychologically damaging, it made me feel worthless and unattractive so I deleted them all and decided to focus on myself more. And I did just that. I am a lot happier as a person and surround myself with friends, and while they show me unconditional love, there is always that intimate love that is missing that they cannot provide. Gone were the days that I allow myself to hook up because I get too easily attached to someone, so I really have no idea where to turn to.\nI was introduced to two guys this past summer by my housemates, and they are both really nice people. However, one of them is not ready to commit to a relationship again because of his work and school taking up his life and the other is a nurse in an emergency wing so his schedule is almost always full. What hurts more is that I am trying the best to my ability to make an effort and show them who I really am. I honestly find myself constantly being the one to message them, call them, set up a date with them, etc.\nIt has been so long since I have had anyone give me the same attention as I did them. I really have no idea what I am doing wrong, and I could really use the advice of anyone willing to share. I will deeply appreciate this. It is getting to a point where even though I am at my happiest right now, the amount of loneliness I am feeling because of a lack of intimacy is starting to take a toll on me personally to a point where I constantly feel fatigued, have random bursts of depression and constantly thinking about \"what could have been\" or \"what I want to happen\" I feel like this is getting a bit unhealthy for me.\nThank you for listening and apologies for the very long thread.\n2", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:26:48.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "081d8133fcc619901379474d2e79ac3e57e7fefd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzZTDPhGhY5DMzhoZ0w86k_Ej4pxh19z9qalja9pS3oJayShfKij3Wd5VQmQXJvefTEcQfkLqLOREPSUGnBYqKfrLHXQvItwmzgb2M12S78r7Ga0q4_2LShXGa2CddHMD4-", "site_full": "forums.roadbikereview.com", "site": "roadbikereview.com", "site_section": "http://forums.roadbikereview.com/forum.php", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "scuba_diving", "sports", "home_video_dvd", "tech", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting"], "section_title": "Road Bike, Cycling Forums", "title": "Heavy CPU usage in forums", "title_full": "Heavy CPU usage in forums", "published": "2017-11-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31460, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45d9bbf77faefdd8083ad0ced58ef35ae4a42661", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzZTDPhGhY5DMzhoZ0w86k_Ej4pxh19z9qalja9pS3oJayShfKij3Wd5VQmQXJvefTEcQfkLqLOREPSUGnBYqKfrLHXQvItwmzgb2M12S78r7Ga0q4_2LSh5POY62_Ov2B3o1yzXUXRQmpxnXllwKbw", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "spdntrxi", "published": "2017-11-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It\u0092s one way to ban me ...

Sunny Wong   Shelby Knowles \nThe American Dream isn\u2019t dead, but in Texas, it needs a dose of medicine. That\u2019s not a political statement, just an objective reading of the data. The data tell us we have work to do if we hope to meet the goals set to help the state continue to thrive economically. \nSure, many parts of the state \u2014 mainly the metropolitan areas and, especially, some of the suburbs \u2014 continue to thrive. Even Houston is doing fine, despite a prolonged slump in oil prices that dramatically slashed energy payrolls. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas recently rated the city\u2019s outlook \u201c positive \u201d after a brief downturn related to Hurricane Harvey. \nBut a recent report on social mobility in Texas offered policymakers at the state, regional and local levels clear evidence that large portions of the state\u2019s population are falling behind on a variety of measures of well-being, from education and income to teen births. All of those data points suggest inter-generational mobility, or the likelihood that children will do better than their parents, is stalling in some parts of the state. \nOpportunity, it turns out, partly depends on where, and in what circumstances, you are born. Fixing that to ensure Texas has the skilled workforce it will need for the information economy of the future needs to be a priority. \nMany of our policymakers get it. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board set a goal that by 2030, at least 60 percent of Texans ages 25-34 will have post-secondary degrees or certificates. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner established a task force to address inequality within the city. \nBut people continue to be left behind, and it is up to state and local leaders to address the widening gap in skills and social mobility. \nAmong the findings of the report, produced by the Hobby School of Public Affairs: The Rio Grande Valley has the highest number of negative factors for social mobility, from high poverty to births to teen mothers and low education levels. Metropolitan regions, especially the region including Austin, have fewer negative indicators. Students in the Austin area report the highest standardized test scores in elementary and middle school and the highest scores on college admissions tests. Teen mothers are most common in the Rio Grande Valley and west Texas. Gini coefficients in all areas of the state \u2014 a common measure of income inequality \u2014 top the average for members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In fact, Texas ranked on par with Cameroon, Ecuador and Peru on the inequality index. \nSome of the key findings were expected. The Rio Grande Valley and Austin are, in many respects, far more than 350 miles apart. \nEven so, there were surprises. Educational attainment is linked to higher income. But while people with at least a high school diploma were less likely to be poor across most of the state, more than one in four adults with a high school diploma in the Lower Rio Grande Valley lives in poverty. \nSo what do we do with this information? \nFirst, it is important to create a data platform that tracks people over time to develop a more detailed picture of opportunity in Texas, but we already know our state is too diverse for one-size-fits-all solutions. Moreover, this type of data also can show how people rebound economically. We know from national studies using this type of data there is a good deal of dynamism in economic mobility. Are there policies that assist in economic rebound and overall resilience? \nSecond, policies should provide choice; both early childhood education and job training might, and probably should, look different in Dallas than they do in West Texas. Policies should also promote a favorable business environment, which is critical to enable local firms and companies to create job opportunities for individuals with better training and education. Any options will need to be backed by resources, both public and private. \nResources especially should be targeted to areas where opportunity and social mobility is most lacking. Might the cities where opportunity is flourishing protest the flow of public monies to areas that are sparsely populated? Perhaps, but those rural areas may also be good places for inexpensive pilot programs to learn what works. \nIf public policy follows the data, we can restore opportunity and, with it, save the American Dream. \nDisclosure: The University of Houston has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune.
