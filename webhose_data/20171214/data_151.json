I think I did a good job of hiding how annoyed I have been with him since early on in his tenure when he reversed course on charter schools, and then was taken by the suits and wanted to bring the Olympics to Boston right after our horrible winter when we saw how failed our infrastructure really is. And then the race car driving in South Boston, and the huge tax giveaways to GE, and the building of more luxury condos and underfunding of public education ... \u263a Dear Mayor Walsh,I was so happy and excited last week when City Council voted on the single-use plastic bag ban. It is the right direction for Boston and will help with our city's litter problem and will make an important contribution to our environmental goals. It's a seemingly small step, but we must do all we can to stop climate change and protect our resources.I suspect the American Progressive Bag Alliance is lobbying you hard with arguments that changing Bostonians' behaviors regarding bag use will be tough on the elderly and on those with less income. Please don't listen to corporate interests on this front. I am over 55 and I quickly adapted to bringing reusable cloth bags to the grocery store and now even CVS and other stores. People with lower incomes risk being negatively affected by climate change (and plastic is sourced from petroleum) more than the wealthy, so this ban really is for them. In addition, low-income folks are not stupid: they value the environment and can connect the dots. Furthermore, like me, they can learn to carry bags. Don't underestimate them.In addition to those specific counters to the APBA arguments, please remember that YOU are the mayor, and that there are ways that YOU can work with the councilors and interested citizens (there are many of us) to support the transition to reusable shopping bags via ad campaigns, free bags (such as Boomerang Bags, but you could also have some \"Boston Pride\"-type bags available free or at a very low cost in areas populated with the demographics that APBA argues are of concern), and other measures that I imagine the 60 towns and cities in Massachusetts that have already adopted this policy can share.I urge you: Please don't listen to the plastic bag companies and please don't deny your dream for Boston being a \"world-class city.\" We all want you to realize that vision. And it is possible, but perhaps not with the glitz of the Olympics or car racing or even GE. A true world-class city serves its citizens.

We drew 0-0 but the boys got a game under the belts and that was good, so it means we are in a decent position if the game goes ahead.\u201d \nThe Jags were hopeful of the game going ahead on Saturday, but a small area of the Thorniewood pitch put paid to those plans. \nPaterson explained: \u201cOn Friday night the game looked like a goer and there was a good thaw overnight, but there was a part of the pitch underneath a stand that\u2019s always in the shade and it was dangerous. Jags gaffer Alan Paterson (Image: Karen M Scott) \n\u201cThere was an inspection at 11am and the referee didn\u2019t think that area would thaw out in time for kick-off (at 1.45pm), so that was that.\u201d \nTemperatures are set to plummet this weekend with forecasts predicting the mercury will fall below zero overnight on Friday into Saturday. \nAnd Paterson fears his side\u2019s 4-0 defeat to Blantyre Victoria on November 18 could be their last game of 2017. \nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t think the weather has been that bad recently, so I worry what\u2019s going to happen once we get deeper into December. \n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to go waiting another week and it could end up being next year before we play again. \n\u201cWe are only scheduled to play fixtures up until December 16, but we might be able to push for the fixture to be played on December 23 if this keeps going on. Thistle players celebrate during their win over Girvan in the last round of the Junior Cup (Image: Karen M Scott) \n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens, but we want to get this played because Junior Cup matches take precedence over the league. \n\u201cThe games are starting to stack up and we know it\u2019s going to affect us later in the season, playing Monday, Wednesday, Saturday if this continues. \n\u201cIdeally, we get it played on Saturday and then the following week we can get our league game at Lesmahagow played to get another game in before the Christmas break.\u201d \nSaturday\u2019s clash at Robertson Park is a 1.45pm kick-off, weather permitting. \nThistle do have a friendly with Vale of Clyde on Tuesday on a 4G surface, so the Jags should at least get a kick of the ball next week to keep them ticking over if their cup clash falls victim to the weather once more.

Spend Money on Experiences   Metrocebu News Team \nWhen shopping for the perfect gift this year, consider research that shows people appreciate and remember experiences more than physical things. It\u2019s also better for the buyer too \u2014 people who spend money on experiences over material items are happier and feel their money is better spent. Here are some creative ideas to share experiences with everyone on your list. \nUse your rewards points. If you\u2019re a travel junkie, you already know the value of experiences. Make the most of your rewards points with the Marriott Rewards Moments program , which gives members access to sporting events, culinary experiences, entertainment packages and truly unique money-can\u2019t-buy moments; moreover, such points can be used either by purchase, be bid on or auction style. \nLearn together. There\u2019s nothing like learning a new skill or hobby to help build self-esteem and life satisfaction. Sign you and your best friend up for a cross-stitching or painting workshop, take salsa dancing lessons with your partner, or gift your parents a professional-grade camera and a membership to a photography club. Recipients will love a skill that lasts well beyond the new year. \nEncourage self-care. The holidays are a busy and stressful time of year, and many of us forget to make our well-being a priority. That\u2019s why experiences that pamper and rejuvenate are sure to be cherished by your friends and family. Try gifts that make people feel good, like a weekend at the spa, a gym membership or a gift certificate for a massage. \nwww.newscanada.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "metrocebu news team", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marriott rewards moments", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:02.113+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93c3edd7a97c86cb314bbf418a1756caa55e7dfb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRX2t8fzyPXpqD9b199k7oHA5FDwggw4srDi2DS6MF3pgzZpgW16JIeq4pnRnNtqi_qUq__8Iowyp9i7bWvVe4PqWsdN2Khdi0-", "site_full": "steroidpowdergear.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://steroidpowdergear.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "HGH for bodybuilding \u2013 Landmarkchem_Candice", "title": "HGH for bodybuilding", "title_full": "HGH for bodybuilding", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "93c3edd7a97c86cb314bbf418a1756caa55e7dfb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRX2t8fzyPXpqD9b199k7oHA5FDwggw4srDi2DS6MF3pgzZpgW16JIeq4pnRnNtqi_qUq__8Iowyp9i7bWvVe4PqWsdN2Khdi0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "steroidpowdergear", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "HGH for bodybuilding", "text": "Email: candice.fang@landmarkchem.com/candicefanghappy@gmail.com Wickr: candice88 Skype: candicefang.happy  \nGrowth hormone effects Although growth hormone was created to treat GH deficiency, it is highly popular in sports, especially in bodybuilding. The popularity is easy to explain \u2013 growth hormone combines 3 benefits:\n.good muscle gains\n.fat loss at the same time as gaining muscles\n.few side effects\n \nHow growth hormone influences bodybuilding performance? HGH influence muscle and fat tissues both directly and indirectly. When growth hormone is injected subcutaneously (under skin) it rapidly gets to the bloodstream. Then, part of growth hormone binds to somatropin receptors in muscles and fat tissue.\nSecond, fat burning effect of HGH is caused by increase in free fatty acids (FFA) level and higher availability of fat as source of energy. Exactly potency to induce fat using for energy explains phenomenon of loosing fat without diet restriction.\nThird HGH bodybuilding benefit is joints and ligaments repair.\n \nDosage of HGH for bodybuilding Effective HGH bodybuilding dosage starts from 4 IUs, so 4-5 IUs is enough for your first experience. Growth hormone shows linear increase of effect due to the dosage until it exaggerates 12-15 IUs. Higher dosages are needed only if you are more than 100 kg of lean mass or performing bodybuilding professionally (these features usually coincide).\nWhen should I inject HGH? Growth hormone shows the highest fat burning efficiency, when your blood sugar and insulin is low. It is because insulin and growth hormone have antagonistic effects on fat tissue.\nSo, the best time for injection is morning, exactly after you wake up fasting. Then, if you perform cutting, you should do cardio. It will be extremely efficient, because HGH increase FFA level and intense aerobic will take energy exactly from fat.\nSecond injection should be after 5-6 hours after the first. Some people advice to do it after 3 hours, but it isn\u2019t correct. Although HGH destroys within 3-4 hours, IGF level is still very high for the next 6-8 hours.\nBoth injections should be equal in quantity.\n \n \n \nKEY WORDS: LEGIT CLOMID CLOMIPHERE CITRATE ANTI-ESTROGEN CLOMID PCT MEDICATION CLOMID NOLVADEX TAMOXIFEN CITRATE BUY TAMOXIFEN CITRATE PCT TAMOXIFEN CITRATE FOR GYNO ANTI-ESTROGEN AROMASIN PCT MEDICINE EXEMESTANE ANABOLIC STEROID AROMASIN POWDER NO GYNO DRUG LETROZOLE AI LETROZOLE DOSAGE BUY MIFEPREX ONLINE TURINABOL STEROID ORAL TURINABOL POWDER CLOSTEBOL STEROID CLOSTEBOL POWDER ANASTROZOLE STEROID ANASTROZOLE ARIMIDEX TREATMENT BOLDENONE STEROID BOLDENONE ACETATE STEROIDS BUY VETERINARY STEROIDS BOLDENONE CYPIONATE STEROID POWDER BUY BOLDENONE CYPIONATE BUY EQUIPOISE BOLDENONE UNDECYLENATE BOLDENONE STEROID BOLDENONE UNDECYLENATE INJECTION DIANABOL MUSCLE POWDER LEGIT SOURCE FOR DIANABOL BUY REAL ANAVAR FOR WOMEN ANAVAR STEROID POWDER WEIGHT LOSS STEROIDS ANADROL ORAL STEROID RAW ANADROL POWDER WINSTROL STANOZOLOL ORAL LIQUID WINSTROL METHENOLONE ACETATE STEROID POWDER FOR ORAL USE METHENOLONE ACETATE METHENOLONE ENANTHATE POWDER MASTERON DROSTANOLONE ENANTHATE BUY INJECTABLE MASTERON MASTERON PROPIONATE SUPERDROL POWDER BUY REAL ORAL SUPERDROL ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ffa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "igf", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:02.121+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b6bd76393737ac3ea26fc8c5105b42d6834de3ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9bK4EYJkUn9ICEb.7W7O5VZeDM77Y3YtbkSFcMPwrC5S_PH96qTho9G8mScqAjc4odoXSYh0W1IA--", "site_full": "www.iddabulteni.com", "site": "iddabulteni.com", "site_section": "http://www.iddabulteni.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "\u0130ddaa Oran \u015eikesi Taktikleri", "title": "07 Aral\u0131k S\u00fcpriz Ma\u00e7lar", "title_full": "07 Aral\u0131k S\u00fcpriz Ma\u00e7lar", "published": "2017-12-07T10:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b6bd76393737ac3ea26fc8c5105b42d6834de3ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9bK4EYJkUn9ICEb.7W7O5VZeDM77Y3YtbkSFcMPwrC5S_PH96qTho9G8mScqAjc4odoXSYh0W1IA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kemik 0 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "07 Aral\u0131k S\u00fcpriz Ma\u00e7lar", "text": "07 Aral\u0131k S\u00fcpriz Ma\u00e7lar\n\n630 Real Sociedad - Zenit ilk Yar\u0131 Berabere Bitere Oran:2.00\n628 Marsilya - Salzburg ilk Yar\u0131 Berabere Bitere Oran:2.25\n617 Medipol Ba\u015fak\u015fehir - Braga ilk Yar\u0131 Berabere Bitere Oran:2.00\n612 Atalanta - Lyon ilk Yar\u0131 Berabere Bitere Oran:2.00 \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aral\u0131k s\u00fcpriz ma\u00e7lar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "real sociedad - zenit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medipol ba\u015fak\u015fehir - braga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atalanta", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salzburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:02.130+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4aa33c3929ca073d8dca8d815eca7f2380ab6198", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QQsPOci8k5QB.wPDN1jHMrHorxPwrn5dTNB35qGH3nihMKOGiaEx1WLlDFT4Q9rBd7kVy6LrsUZA--", "site_full": "atheistfoundation.org.au", "site": "atheistfoundation.org.au", "site_section": "http://atheistfoundation.org.au/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=53", "site_categories": ["religion", "atheism_agnosticism"], "section_title": "Religion, Unreason and Similar Tropes - AFA Forums", "title": "Gay Panic!

She didn\u2019t make it as the Top Scorer in the online competition, but she made it to the finals as Asia\u2019s regional representative until declared winner this week. \nThe entrants must display skills in science communication and to be able to simplify complex ideas into basic terms. The videos were evaluated based on four criteria: Creativity, Difficulty, Engagement and Illumination. \nThis was Andales\u2019 second time in the competition. \nLast year, with more than 300,000 views of her video, she won the Top Popular Vote. \nShe automatically qualified as finalist for her video presentation on Feyman\u2019s Path Integrals explaining in advance Physics concept that can be understood by an average person. \nThis lone BJC winner is a recipient of Mga Bagong Rizal 2017: Pag-asa ng Bayan. The awarding will be on December 30, the Rizal Day. \nThe said nationwide search recognizes young people\u2019s community involvements, leadership potential and high academic standing. \nIn her Facebook message, Andales wrote \u201cI\u2019ve always looked up to two kind of stars, those who shine at night, enchanting my mind about the universe, and those that shine before me now- these amazing scientists inspiring me with their genius and tenacity to pursue the truth.\u201d \nRey Garnace, PSHS EV Director, said on Wednesday that he\u2019s euphoric of the victory but not surprised. \n\u201cAndales has been our school pride. She has imbibed the vision of the school to have a passion for excellence, pursuit for truth, and service to the nation.\u201d \nSuper typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) has pushed the scholars to be more resilient and inspired, according to Garnace. \nThe campus has become a powerhouse of winners in international arena since 2015 being the champion in ASEAN + 3 Junior Science Odyssey, World Champion in Robotics in 2016 and BJC Grand Prize 2017. \nThe Breakthrough Junior Challenge is funded by Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, Yuri and Julia Milner, through the Breakthrough Prize Foundation, based on a grant from Mark Zuckerber\u2019s fund at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation and a grant from Milner Global Foundation.

review below. You can save A LOTS (even more than Apple Education Price, which is only capped at RM500, documents required) and worth your every single pennies. it is definitely a genuine product from Apple Malaysia. Sockets are 3-pin (Malaysia) type. And, it is a Mid-June 2017 product. The packing is damn so good. No worries about the MBA box will get dent or damaged as Lazada packed it in much larger box which filled with many bubble-plastics to protect the MBA. As for Invoice Tax Receipt, for my case, I didn't receive it in the box nor via email. For those who need it for Tax Refund, you need to contact or ask Lazada Customer Care before buying it. As for installment question, It is ONLY available to Maybank Credit Card holders. You can have from 6 months to 24 months installment. Upon checkout step, you need to choose Maybank Credit Card, and then just follow the steps to complete installment option. As for delivery, I received my parcel from LEX (Lazada Express) within a day, which was the fastest delivery ever I have ever received. Hope Lazada will bring more APPLE products (like iPad Pro 10.5, iPhone etc) to have GREAT discounts. Thank you Lazada for fulfilling my dream with AMAZING price where no other authorized\\/premium Apple outlets can offer.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:04.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1b3d4b26f94c6f4c50fab289543aba5c1f710bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFepAMFMhgGfes4hFQdPUDRPIK6JhXkfsee2pyN.v8e5lIzZxWV4rkZjHR8QlWLqzjJgpwnCFBWfse9rHycoyFEXP7KEo.RBj1Wp_QZnylUL3RPCL6pKbB7dV7D59O0BFcBBIEAYk.YVA_BjGMuof0j2hcuO4Rmp6Iw", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/shop-laptops/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Top Online Laptop Brands With Best Price At Lazada Malaysia", "title": "[2017 Model] Apple MacBook Air 13\" MQD42ZP/A (Core i5 1.8GHz/256GB/8GB Ram)", "title_full": "[2017 Model] Apple MacBook Air 13\" MQD42ZP/A (Core i5 1.8GHz/256GB/8GB Ram) | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-11-01T08:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.913, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9ba63398b87411c51caf485f59ce5bb2c8a951b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFepAMFMhgGfes4hFQdPUDRPIK6JhXkfsee2pyN.v8e5lIzZxWV4rkZjHR8QlWLqzjJgpwnCFBWfse9rHycoyFEXP7KEo.RBj1Wp_QZnylUL3RPCL6pKbB7dV7D59O0BFcBBIEAYk.YVA_BjGMuof0j2ivnKlQ.3fdSI4JwBiFV5wU-", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "Weng K.", "published": "2017-12-01T07:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "A bargain and genuine product covered by Apple Malaysia", "text": "There is no reason not to buy this if you are planning to get one.

Getting what they can free. They should receive no assistance. Some in our society have found themselves in a predicament of needing help through no fault of their own. Society should assist them. They Church should reach out to them. However, there are others who are in a predicament because of laziness and slothfulness. Let them fend for themselves. A greater spiritual relevance is that those who do not labor in the work of the Church should not benefit from God\u2019s blessings of the Church. For there are also some in the church who are just idle. They are lazy and slothful like the one who will not work. They are busybodies. Causing confusion. Causing dissension. Doing nothing but complaining. Let them do as they will. Paul says but you , my brethren, you continue to do good. Continue to love your neighbors. Continue to reach out to the poor and elderly. Continue to visit the sick and incarcerated. Continue to share the gospel in love. Continue to be about doing good. Don\u2019t get discouraged. Don\u2019t become idle. Don\u2019t get tired of doing the work that God has assigned to our hands. Be not weary in well doing. \nAbout Pastor Givens Speak Your Mind Tell us what you're thinking... and oh, if you want a pic to show with your comment, go get a gravatar !", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "givens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "givens speak your mind tell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus christ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "church", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:04.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "88945b245bda3b4d04d62c564d25d7011a4d0c8e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxaOoUs78mOojZ2ty1l2pTcnixASS8l9nNe3vKr010SxUf_5n55huI30xfMLENqeXmFmW6poaLhpV2t7j3AnJBzwpomDni5W04", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://nytimes.com/timeswire/feeds/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NYT > Most Recent Headlines", "title": "A Seven-Hour \u2018Les Mis\u00e9rables\u2019?

Credit Matthias Horn Tradition was the rallying cry on Sunday for the 70th anniversary of the Komische Oper Berlin , one of the city\u2019s three opera houses. The festivities included a visit from Germany\u2019s president, a massive birthday cake and the hotly awaited premiere of \u201c Fiddler on the Roof \u201d (known here as \u201cAnatevka\u201d) in a new production by the company\u2019s artistic director, Barrie Kosky.\nFounded in 1947 by the Austrian director Walter Felsenstein, the Komische Oper spent most of its history behind the Iron Curtain. Felsenstein\u2019s tradition of presenting the full gamut of \u201cMusiktheater ,\u201d a term that encompasses everything from Cole Porter to Wagner, continues to this day. It is not unusual to find musicals on the programs of opera houses in Germany and Austria, where, unlike on Broadway or the West End, few theaters specialize in them.\nMr. Kosky, who arrived at the company in 2012, has arguably had a more galvanizing effect on the house than anyone since its founder. Over the past five seasons, he has focused on neglected and musically challenging works. \u201cFiddler on the Roof,\u201d however, belongs to neither category: It was Felsenstein\u2019s single most popular production, with more than 500 performances from 1971 to 1988.\nMr. Kosky understands that the best traditions are the ones that can constantly reinvent themselves. Bringing back \u201cFiddler\u201d after nearly three decades, he has removed the mothballs and nostalgia. The set designers, Rufus Didwiszus and Jan Freese, have built the shtetl Anatevka as a massive rotating assemblage of antique wardrobes that stand in for most of the interior locations, and whose swinging doors facilitate entrances and exits.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Against this backdrop, Otto Pichler\u2019s choreography is a jolt of pure theatrical energy. The original choreography by Jerome Robbins is a clear touchstone, and Mr. Pichler shows a degree of fidelity to Robbins, the musical\u2019s first director \u2014 for instance, in the famous \u201cBottle Dance.\u201d But the movements, performed by 13 dancers, are full of fresh impulse and high-octane exuberance. And when did you last hear Jerry Bock\u2019s magnificent music played by a full orchestra?\nPhoto A scene from \u201cFiddler on the Roof,\u201d directed by Barrie Kosky at the Komische Oper Berlin. Credit Iko Freese Performed in German by a largely non-Jewish cast, this is quite possibly the most convincing \u2014 and least embarrassingly clich\u00e9-ridden \u2014 \u201cFiddler\u201d imaginable. Mr. Kosky\u2019s directorial skills extend to eliminating much of the stereotypical schlock. (The book\u2019s Jewish humor, however, often seemed to soar over the heads of the audience.)\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story As Tevye the milkman, Max Hopp carried most of the evening. This production made a compelling case for Tevye as a great dramatic, rather than musical, role (\u201cIf I Were a Rich Man\u201d is the only vocal firework, after all). Mr. Hopp\u2019s performance peeled back the character\u2019s many layers and identities \u2014 Everyman, fool, pious Jew, paterfamilias \u2014 without ever reducing him to a single one. The milkman emerged as a far more tragic figure \u2014 a Jewish King Lear, as Mr. Kosky suggests in a program note.\nIt\u2019s easy for the character of Golde, Tevye\u2019s wife, to come across as just another nagging spouse. But Dagmar Manzel combined a no-nonsense attitude with subtle warmth and affection. Together with Mr. Hopp, she made the duet \u201cDo You Love Me?\u201d into an understated emotional highlight \u2014 which is not to say there was anything overly somber about this \u201cFiddler,\u201d as evidenced by Barbara Spitz\u2019s scene-chewing performance as Yente, the busybody matchmaker. Translating her role into Yiddish was one of Mr. Kosky\u2019s most inspired choices.\nEncountering Teyve\u2019s milk wagon here in Berlin brings to mind another theatrical icon: the cart dragged by Bertolt Brecht\u2019s \u201cMother Courage\u201d through the Thirty Years\u2019 War. For the past 70 years, the character has also been schlepping it on the stage of the Berliner Ensemble, the theater that Brecht founded in 1949.\nThis season, the Berliner Ensemble is one of two leading theater companies in the city to welcome a new artistic director. The other one is the Volksb\u00fchne, where the appointment of Chris Dercon, the former director of the Tate Modern, as successor to its long-running leader Frank Castorf has been seen by many as a hostile take over .\nMr. Castorf was invited by Oliver Reese, the Berliner Ensemble\u2019s new artistic director, to direct his first post-Volksb\u00fchne production there, and the result is a seven-and-a-half-hour adaptation of Victor Hugo\u2019s \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables.\u201d Fans of Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg\u2019s blockbuster musical version are advised to stay far away.\nPhoto In the leading role of Tevye the milkman, Max Hopp carried most of the evening. Credit Iko Freese Outside Germany, Mr. Castorf is best known for his controversial 2013 production of Wagner\u2019s \u201cRing\u201d at the Bayreuth Festival, whose settings included a sleazy motel, Wall Street and the Alexanderplatz square in central Berlin. With its frequently rotating sets, roving cameras and a cast that looked (and behaved) like pimps and streetwalkers, the \u201cRing\u201d presented by Mr. Castorf was a distillation of his style.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story He tends to use a collagelike technique that incorporates outside texts and can alter the original works beyond recognition, but in accordance with Bayreuth tradition, his contract stipulated that he must not change a single word or note by Wagner.\nThere is no such restriction at the Berliner Ensemble, where Mr. Castorf overlays \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d with the Cuban author Guillermo Cabrera Infante\u2019s experimental novel \u201cThree Sad Tigers,\u201d the East German playwright Heiner M\u00fcller\u2019s seminal postmodern drama \u201cThe Mission,\u201d and \u201cI Am Cuba,\u201d an odd mix of Soviet agitprop and avant-garde filmmaking from 1964. (All of the action has been moved to Havana.) Mr. Castorf has a reputation for lengthy, loud and taxing evenings at the theater, and this production of \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d is no exception.

The 12 who twirl through these nearly 450 minutes gave it their all, reciting reams of text while cavorting around the intricate, multilevel set. They bare their souls, their bodies and, occasionally, their bodily fluids \u2014 basins of stage blood mingle with real snot and tears onstage.\nBut only one of the players, J\u00fcrgen Holtz, manages to connect with the audience, with his gentle, commanding presence and unhurried delivery. As Bishop Myriel, who feeds Valjean, gives him shelter and then lets him keep the silver he has stolen, the 85-year-old theater veteran projects compassion and humanity.

Representational image. Image courtesy: Russian Helicopters \n\"The way to address this problem is to set up facilities with our partners. We also need assurance from the Indian side that their products will be used by the end user,\" Kaldov told PTI in Moscow. \nIt has been a long-standing grievance of the Indian armed forces that supply of critical spares and equipment from Russia takes a long-time, affecting maintenance of military systems procured from Moscow. \nTerming it a \"complicated issue\", Kaldov said Rostec was cooperating with Indian defence ministry to address the problem and manufacturing company Russian Helicopters plans to create service in India on the principle of \"one window\", which will simplify and accelerate the work in this direction. \n\"This is a pilot project and India is the first country where it is being implemented. India is interested in the implementation of this project, as it is operating the largest fleet of Russian helicopters,\" he said. \nRussia has been a major supplier of military platforms to India. Kladov said Rostec companies were interested in increasing the efficiency of after-sales service and simplifying the procedures for supply of spare parts to India. \"About a year ago, the Government of Russia decided to grant the right to a number of major Russian defence industry companies to directly conduct after-sales service, repair and modernisation of previously delivered military hardware. \n\"Now Russian Helicopters, United Engine Corporation, Techmash, Schwabe and High-Precision Weapons can directly interact with Indian customers on these issues,\" he said. \nKaldov noted that the very sophisticated defence equipment needed to be addressed in a specific workshop and licensed parts and spares should be used and technology of repair should be controlled by the manufacturer and the chief designer of the products. \"This is an issue which is both sided. And our rule is to provide life time support for the equipment. Sometimes the end user becomes opportunistic and its looking to buy spares elsewhere to make it cheaper. So they are outsourced in other countries,\" he said. \nKaldov said he had pointed out the concerns of the Russian companies regarding production of spares in India in his recent meeting with an Indian minister. He said the company was offered a space to set up a facility to produce components, spares for electronics, machinery, engines and helicopters in Maharashtra. \nKaldov said Indian officials have told them that Russian manufacturers to participate in international tender exercise if they want to sell their products to the Indian armed forces. \n\"We will set up facilities and this can only be done if the Indian government assures that the Russian products will be purchased,\" he said. Speaking on the issue of India inching closer to the US and Israel in terms of defence deals and procurement, Kladov said he did not see it as a threat, but as a challenge for Russia as the market is becoming more competitive. \n\"We don't see it as a threat rather as a challenge. It gives us thrust to do better and be more innovative and proactive. We don't fear competition. Let's look at the broader picture, its industrial cooperation, strategic trust which gives us a cutting edge,\" he said. Calling the relationship between India and Russia a \"privileged strategic partnership\", Kladov said it meant \"we trust our Indian partners with most sensitive defence inventions and achievements\". \n\"America has many competitive products to offer. It's for Indian government to choose. It's up for the Indian government to build up balances. I can only speak on behalf of the Russian side. We are firm friends and strategic partners of the Indian republic,\" he said. \nPublished Date: Dec 07, 2017 02:44 pm | Updated Date: Dec 07, 2017 02:44 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kaldov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kladov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rostec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schwabe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viktor n kladov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "techmash", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russian helicopters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united engine corporation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maharashtra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:07.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6d5d9546acd379a0f790c71e1607c069ac5b83f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3Iier7qVqDgA7NcMj05GRacQX34ifRLOug-", "site_full": "eraporn.com", "site": "eraporn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "", "title": "My step uncle giving me a lesson", "title_full": "My step uncle giving me a lesson", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CZ", "spam_score": 0.684, "main_image": "https://thumb-v-ec.xhcdn.com/t/119/1_b_8078119.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a6d5d9546acd379a0f790c71e1607c069ac5b83f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3Iier7qVqDgA7NcMj05GRacQX34ifRLOug-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "My step uncle giving me a lesson", "text": "My step uncle giving me a lesson My step uncle giving me a lesson 01:13 MP4 480p MP4 720p Watch My step uncle giving me a lesson porn video online on the best adult site EraPorn.com, the best sex tube with million videos of Young and Old porn movies.

Moore recently held a rally in Fairhope, Alabama, with Steve Bannon as one of his special guest speakers. \nThe plot with Moore thickens though as another big secret has been revealed related to his past. According to public court records, Moore committed adultery against his first wife. The Washington Examiner reports : \n\u2018Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore\u2019s account of when he began dating his wife Kayla would place the start of their courtship before her divorce from her first husband, according to court documents.\u2019 \nThe Examiner asked Moore\u2019s campaign to explain the apparent contradiction between what he has said about he and Kayla\u2019s relationship versus what records reveal. Campaign spokesman Brett Doster responded in an email saying: \n\u2018Regardless of when they met, Judge and Kayla did not date while she was still with her ex-husband or legally married.\u2019 \nMoore wrote in his 2005 book that he met Kayla at a church gathering right before Christmas in 1984. He wrote: \n\u2018I was determined to get to know her, but Kayla, divorced and with a beautiful little girl, Heather, who was nearly a year old, was not interested in a relationship with anyone.\u2019 \nAccording to The Examiner though: \n\u2018Divorce records obtained by the Washington Examiner show that Kayla, however, had not yet even filed for divorce from her first husband, John Charles Heald, by the time she caught Moore\u2019s attention at the Christmas gathering. \n\u2018In fact, Kayla and Heald had only just separated on Dec. 1, 1984, two weeks before her and Moore\u2019s serendipitous introduction.\u2019 \nThose same records show that Kayla had filed for divorce on December 28, 1984, and it was finalized nearly four months later on April 19, 1985. A permanent custody judgement was issued on January 9, 1989. \nMoore has said that he began dating Kayla \u201csoon after\u201d she visited the law office of his colleague \u201cearly in the new year\u201d of 1985. He claims that they dated for one year before becoming engaged and then married on December 14, 1985. \nIt is easy to deduce from these dates that Moore and Kayla probably began dating in late 1984 or early 1985, and court records show that Kayla was still legally married to Heald and would be until spring. A close source who was asked about whether she was dating Moore before her divorce was finalized, said: \n\u2018That was always an assumption.\u2019 \nThe source also revealed that Moore had given Kayla\u2019s daughter a puppy on Valentine\u2019s Day of 1985, which also suggests that they were dating one another at the time. \nThe irony of it all is what prompted The Examiner to write the story is that there were discrepancies in his story versus court records and what others have said. Moore has tried relentlessly to try to discredit his accusers based on alleged inconsistencies in very marginal details of their accounts. \nBasically, Moore has written quite a more favorable story in relation to both his wife and the stories from his accusers. If he wins the election, how long will his supporters continue to believe him? He is surely not convincing to most people. \nFeatured image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "melanie davidson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john charles heald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heather", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kayla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe raedle/getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brett doster", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "examiner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington examiner", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fairhope", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:21:07.007+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15133572, "moreResultsAvailable": 15133472, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512638467007&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 787}
