With the advent of King James II to the throne in 1685 religious animosity had grown between the Protestants and Catholics of Ireland. The former resented the growing power of the latter and they in turn suspected their religious opponents of disloyalty to James who was of the Catholic Faith. \n\nEvents came to a head when a son was born to the King in June 1688. This meant that if the boy reached maturity he would succeed his father as a Catholic Monarch true to the Old Faith. But on 5 November of that year William of Orange landed in England and set himself in opposition to King James. A War between the Faiths looked inevitable and in Ireland this indeed proved the case. \n\nKing James wished to secure his position in this Country as at least here he could rely on the most widespread support from the Catholic population. The Catholic Earl of Antrim was ordered to secure the City of Londonderry for King James. The said Earl, Alexander MacDonnell, advanced to Derry with some 1200 men. He sent an advanced party across the river Foyle to enter and take the main gate and hold it until he brought up the bulk of his force. \nJust at this moment thirteen young apprentices, most of whom appear, from their names, to have been of Scottish birth or descent, flew to the guard room, armed themselves, seized the keys of the city, rushed to the Ferry Gate, closed it in the face of the King\u2019s officers, and let down the portcullis. \n\u2018 History of England \u2019 by Lord Macaulay. \nThis was a setback for the Royal cause as it galvanised opposition amongst the Protestant population there to resist and await relief from England should (as was most likely) William succeed in his daring enterprise. As it turned out the city was not taken and despite much suffering held out until relieved the following Summer. It was a turning point in Irish History & indeed of British History as this act of defiance has imbued within the Protestant population of the North ever since a notion that loyalty to the Crown was conditional upon the Monarch being not a Catholic but one of their own.

Average speed of the flight: 2145mph. \n\u201cThere were a lot of things we couldn\u2019t do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment. \nIt occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet. \nI was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn\u2019t match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. \nJust to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace. \nWe listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: \u201cNovember Charlie 175, I\u2019m showing you at ninety knots on the ground.\u201d \nNow the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the \u201c Houston Center voice.\u201d I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country\u2019s space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn\u2019t matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios. \nJust moments after the Cessna\u2019s inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. \u201cI have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed.\u201d Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. \u201cCenter, Dusty 52 ground speed check\u201d. Before Center could reply, I\u2019m thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol\u2019 Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He\u2019s the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: \u201cDusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.\u201d \nAnd I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we\u2019ll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn. \nSomewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: \u201cLos Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?\u201d There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. \u201cAspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.\u201d \nI think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: \u201cAh, Center, much thanks, we\u2019re showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.\u201d \nFor a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A. came back with, \u201cRoger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.\u201d \nIt all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day\u2019s work. \nWe never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.\u201d \n-Brian Schul, Sled Driver: Flying The World\u2019s Fastest Jet \nAlways reblog passive-aggressive Blackbird speed check \nguys seriously tho what the fuck even was the SR-71 blackbird. That plane is like someone made a fucking bet. Like someone went \u201cI have ten bucks that says you can\u2019t make something that cruises at Mach 2.5\u2033 and the aero folks scoffed and went hold our collective goddamn beers and then they cracked out a plane that CRUISES AT MACH 3 (for reference the much vaunted \u201csupercruise\u201d of the F-22 is only a few ticks above Mach 1). You need to understand how patently absurd this fucking vehicle is from nose to tail. Its original iteration, the A-12, was the successor to the U-2 when it became clear the USSR had developed missiles that could fly high enough to shoot it down so instead they built a new plane so fast you couldn\u2019t fucking hit it . THAT WAS LITERALLY HOW THE SR-71 WORKED. By the time you realized what was goddamn happening at 80,000 feet it was already out of your fucking timezone. One time a pilot missed a turn by a second and ended up over Atlanta instead of DC. It flew so fast and got so hot that the entire fuselage stretched by several inches midflight which turned out to be a gigantic pain because all the fuel lines were hooked up assuming this stretching factor, so while on the ground it leaked like a goddamn sieve so at one point they decided to combat this BY STUFFING IT FULL OF KOTEX literally they had to shove tampons in this incredibly sophisticated aircraft so the fuel would stay in. It was the first serious aircraft built entirely out of titanium because no other metal could do the job, and at the time titanium wasn\u2019t a widely-used metal so the world\u2019s only major supplier WAS THE ACTUAL USSR SO THE US ACTUALLY BOUGHT THE MATERIAL TO MAKE THEIR SECRET SPY PLANE FROM THE PEOPLE THEY WERE SPYING ON. \nTL;DR Every single thing about this fucking aircraft is fucking ridiculous.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "walter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john wayne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian schul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chuck yeager", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nas lemoore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cessna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aspen", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington dc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ussr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l.a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aspen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount whitney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:29.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1187372df6d4a64881f3ee013023fe7930d1cf92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYNtGt1pOaY6WrUwIiGs2t4p0o1l46XhG5NAkwtfmIc_XRnf6.wiZq56KIk.kLvkOrLiSTxbiRSu9uyfEE2LUhaCPjc3p7gN5bJxOULze5fkkF4C2.vnLCo5ZwtelPELs8QSRaXs3ecFxDFjqZYkuSv78qD77WSZqY.okn_er.bf9AZQT6XdWoeg--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.co.uk", "site": "tripadvisor.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowForum-g150807-i8-o80-Cancun_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Cancun Forum, Travel Discussion for Cancun, Mexico - TripAdvisor", "title": "Real (non-gringo) price for a taxi from downtown to airport? - Cancun", "title_full": "Real (non-gringo) price for a taxi from downtown to airport? - Cancun Message Board - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-07-19T06:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1071, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e57c33bc25ae3cf49dc83595651c804a949bcade", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYNtGt1pOaY6WrUwIiGs2t4p0o1l46XhG5NAkwtfmIc_XRnf6.wiZq56KIk.kLvkOrLiSTxbiRSu9uyfEE2LUhaCPjc3p7gN5bJxOULze5fkkF4C2.vnLCo5ZwtelPELs8QSRaXs3ecFxDFjqZYkuSv78qD77WSZqY.okn_er.bf84O0450fTCKQ--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "travelwiz13", "published": "2017-12-03T20:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Uber is totally fine to use in Cancun.

who has Helene, 13, Lou, eight, Henry, 12, and Johan, 11, - says when she dons items from her range she feels comfortable in the garments, and feels they compliment her own style. \nShe continued: ''I don't feel like when you look at me I'm wearing a costume or that someone put me into this.'' \nHeidi has revealed she teamed up with Lidl because she wanted to reach ''so many women'' with her designs at a lower price point. \nShe explained: ''I can reach so many women with clothes at these prices. \n''I don't know if you can find leather-look-pants for \u00a39.99 anywhere else that feel like these. \n''It's very accessible. \n''There are a lot of designers out there but it's either in a little boutique or too expensive. \n''I feel like every woman goes to the supermarket.'' \nAlthough Heidi believes her creations are suitable for every woman, she has also encouraged her customers to try and experiment with their style. \nThe 'Project Runway' judge continued: ''You can try something that is not in your normal comfort zone because the price is so good. It pushes you to try something you normally wouldn't buy.'' \nAnd the entrepreneur - who set up her own lingerie brand Heidi Klum intimates in 2015 - believes the festive period is the best time for people to go all out with their wardrobe choices. \nAsked about how to dress for Christmas, she said: ''For the holidays, more is more. Play with a red lip or curl your hair, or do an updo you normally wouldn't do.''

You have to give fair time to it, you have to remind yourself that the good stuff is all around you. Gratitude, gratitude, gratitude. Because otherwise it's f***ed, everything's f**ked.'' \nThe 'So What' artist also admitted she has ''hated herself'' for years. \nPink explained: ''I've hated myself at so many points in my life. I look at myself and I'm like, 'Is this it?' But then it automatically changes into either gratitude for my health or f**k it.'' \nAlthough Pink goes through phases of liking and disliking herself, she is now trying to embrace her appearance. \nShe confessed: ''I've got to the stage where I'm like, 'I'm never going to be that size, I'm never going to look younger than this.''' \nEarlier this year, Pink made a touching speech at the MTV Video Music Awards, in which she retold a conversation she had with her oldest child about beauty. \nShe said: ''Recently, I was driving my daughter to school and she said to me, out of the blue, 'Mama, I'm the ugliest girl I know.' \n''She was like, 'Yeah, I look like a boy with long hair.' And my brain went to, 'Oh my God, you're six. Where is this coming from? Who said this? Can I kick a six-year-old's ass?' \n''Her eyes glazed over. But then I said, 'I really want to know why you feel this way about yourself.' And Willow replied, 'I look like a boy.' \n''I told her that when people make fun of me, that's what they use, that I look like a boy ... I have too many opinions ... My body is too strong. Do you see me growing my hair? Do you see me changing my body? Do you see me selling out arenas all over the world? So, baby girl. We don't change.

In fact, it was two different cancers within one mass. \n''Unlike my reaction to my first Big-C diagnosis seven years ago, I was more relaxed, analytic and calm. I was surrounded by professionalism and empathy which gave me a surprising sense of inner peace. \n''After the doctors told me, 'We believe it's cancer,' I did a lot of gigging and a lot of flying: Two countries in South America, Dubai, Japan, Ireland, Liverpool, London and we ended our last round of this year's gigs in Brooklyn, NY. \n''Right after the show, I flew directly from Brooklyn, to Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, NY.

Preparedness comes with having the best medical cover, business cover or any other type of cover. It is advisable to use North Carolina Insurance Agencies . These are some considerations when deciding for the firm you want.\n\nA good company is a company with experience. This is one significant factor to put into consideration when choosing a firm. The experience of a firm can be gauged by the number of years it has been operational or by counter-checking their previous covers offered to clients. Offering services over the years give the company specialization, and therefore they understand the needs of the client.\n\nIn choosing a firm, its reputation is very important. Every business works on building a good rapport with its clients. Therefore talking to others about their past experiences with different firms will give you a broader scope on which firm to settle on. Always go for the company with the highest recommendation as this is a guarantee of client satisfaction.\n\nWork ethics is another key factor when settling on a firm. Principles of work can positively or negatively affect the choice of the customer. Each company deals with its clients in their different way. May it is by communication with their clients or transparency in their dealings, a good insurance company should aim to satisfy the needs of their customers. A firm that is keen on their work ethics and public relations are the best to work with.\n\nTransparency is also important. You should look for a firm that does not have loopholes in which they can use to exploit clients. Companies that are not vast with information on covers and policies offered. Visit your legal advisor to get more information on the agreement you are signing to ensure the best services.\n\nInsurance brokers also play a crucial role in helping clients settle for a firm. They are vastly experienced on all policies available in the market and also know all the companies that are good at offering these services. Most of these brokers have been in the business for many years and therefore have seen companies grow and know which ones are reliable. Furthermore, they save the client effort and time wasted in going through all these companies.\n\nAnother efficient way to find the appropriate firm is to compare policies. There are many companies that deal with the same type of covers and most offer almost the same deals. It is advisable for the client to give scrutiny on all major and minor details of these company concerning their policies. There are many things to consider such as the price, complaints, and co-payments. All these play a major role in ensuring the suitability of this company.\n\nIn settling with an insurance company, one should, therefore, heed to the recommendations received from friends and adhere to all regulations on choosing the right firm. This is sure to provide the best health, business, and family covers.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are searching for information about North Carolina insurance agencies , visit our web pages online today.

Daisy Ridley Warns Of Mental Health Dangers Of Social Media Daisy Ridley Star Wars \nThe 25 year old star quit Instagram earlier this year. \nStar Wars actor Daisy Ridley has spoken out about the dangers to mental health represented by social media, saying that she removed herself from several platforms after having found fame. \nThe 25 year old star, who plays Rey in the upcoming eighth Star Wars film The Last Jedi , quit Instagram earlier this year and said she\u2019ll \u201cnever go back on\u201d. She spoke about why she did so, and about the negative impacts of being on social media on young people, in a new interview with Radio Times . \n\u201cThe more I read about teenage anxiety, the more I think it's highly unhealthy for people's mental health,\u201d she said this week. \u201cIt's such a weird thing for young people to look at distorted images of things they should be.\u201d Daisy Ridley has warned about the dangers of social media to mental health \nRidley rocketed to fame in 2014 when she was cast as the central character of Disney\u2019s revival of the Star Wars series, and featured for the first time in 2015\u2019s The Force Awakens . Prevously, she had only had minor roles in the likes of TV dramas like \u2018Casualty\u2019, and said that \u201clife suddenly got a bit different\u201d after being cast in Star Wars. \nMore: Daisy Ridley says she was \u201cmisquoted\u201d regarding her involvement beyond \u2018Star Wars Ep.

I felt like I was drowning in grief, drowning in the grey weather, and drowning in the story. I picked up smoking.'' \nThe actress met with nearly 30 relatives of murder victims in preparation for her part in the Fatih Akin -directed film. \nAnd Diane admitted that researching the movie changed her life ''forever''. \nShe told the New York Post newspaper's Page Six column: ''Grief is a weird thing, and I felt a heavy responsibility to find the truth and to honour the people that this has happened to.'' \nThis comes shortly after Diane likened shooting the movie to having an ''out-of-body experience''. \nThe acclaimed star was named the Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival for her role in the German-language film, and she's admitted that the production had a profound impact on her. \nShe previously said: ''It was such an out-of-body experience. There are scenes in the movie where I feel like I'm not acting; I'm reacting to what's happening in front of me. I was desperately searching for the truth.'' \nDiane also revealed she felt powerless to stop the dark thoughts from occupying so much of her free time. \nShe explained: ''It was definitely a very dark time in my life, where the border between what is my life and what is reality was really blurred. There was nothing I could do about it.''

This past Friday, Scott Fried, an international, award-winning speaker, youth educator and HIV/AIDS advocate spoke at the University of Rhode Island. He delivered three separate presentations about true intimacy, sexual health and safe sex and an interfaith non-denominational healing service. The scheduling of Fried\u2019s visit was a joint decision between Hillel director Amy Olson and Annie Russell, the director of the Gender and Sexuality center. Fried\u2019s visit also commemorated his 30th year being a survivor of HIV. \nFried has lectured at over 1000 colleges, military bases, synagogues and youth retreats presenting sessions about bullying, the secret lives of teens, the ABC\u2019s of sexually transmitted diseases and the definitions of real consent. His goal: to be relevant and connect with his audience by being able to speak about a variety of topics. \nDiagnosed with HIV three decades ago, Fried\u2019s realization of the true impact he could make on an adolescent audience did not come until a friend of his became his 73rd friend to die of AIDS. Richie had kept a journal in which he wrote about the hope he had for his future, and a few pages were read aloud at his funeral. These few pages began to make Fried consider his own journal. Fried decided that he did not want to be remembered through written words, and did not want to be just another statistic of the AIDS epidemic. In the text of his autobiography, Fried said, \u201cI believe that my real job is to uncover people\u2019s magnificence so that they can know it in themselves and see it in others. It is my hope, thereby, that my presence in your life will help you to recognize, cherish and value your own.\u201d \nAmy Olson, director of the URI Hillel chapter, originally met Scott Fried over 30 years ago in the late 1980s. \n\u201cAt that time, we were in the midst of the AIDS epidemic and he had not all that long ago been diagnosed with HIV and was beginning his educational mission to talk to young adults about AIDS education and issues of self-esteem and loving oneself,\u201d said Olson. \u201cA year ago, I went to the Hillel professional conference and low and behold Scott Fried was there again. We renewed our friendship and I said \u2018it would be great for you to come to URI.\u2019 When I came back for spring semester of last year I reached out to Annie Russell at the Gender and Sexuality center to have Scott come to campus and do a joint program with Hillel.\u201d \nFried\u2019s first presentation was titled, \u201cSocial Media and True Intimacy,\u201d and focused on the ways social networking allows us to broadcast an image of ourselves that is altered. Furthermore, the way we can keep a pocket of secrets. \u201cThere\u2019s the truth, and then there\u2019s the whole truth. True intimacy is finding something out about yourself in the presence of another,\u201d said Fried. \nThe presentation continued, and Fried addressed the numerous ways in which cyber-media allows members to engage in open-ended conversation, leading to a type of \u201cfake\u201d intimacy. Fried referenced ghosting and bailing as two ways in which cyber-media can produce \u201cfake\u201d intimacy. Ghosting and bailing are the acts of suddenly ceasing all communication with someone in hopes they will get the hint and stop trying to communicate back. \u201cOur phones don\u2019t allow us to be awkward. We are not engaging in civilized conversation. You cannot hear enthusiasm in a text. We allow ourselves to be lied to,\u201d said Fried. \nThe second lecture Fried presented went in-depth about STI\u2019s and STD\u2019s and their relation to HIV/AIDS. In addition, the lecture educated about the ways HIV/Aids can be transmitted from person to person, and numerous methods for prevention. The three modes of transmission include mother to child through breastfeeding or blood through the placenta, drug use through an IV or shared needle, and unprotected sex. The four fluids that are used in transmission are blood, semen, breast milk and vaginal secretions. The areas of the body in which transmission occurs are known as Mucous membranes, and are any pink, flushy surface that is exposed such as canker sores in the cheeks or the roof of the mouth. \u201cThe virus just has to slide right through. HIV is a retrovirus. It steals a strand of RNA and turns into into its own DNA,\u201d said Fried. \nIn the evening, Fried accompanied Olson at the Hillel center for a special non-denominational Interfaith Healing Service and Shabbat Dinner. Almost 40 people attended the event, where he concluded his stay at the University with a presentation named \u201cScared to Sacred,\u201d which further discussed AIDS, as well as love and staying alive. In this presentation, Fried told his tale of contraction, the way he turned his curse into a gift, while relating it to the vulnerability a young teen can relate to. \u201cVulnerability is your greatest power, you are defenseless. If you don\u2019t see the magnificence in others, you will not be able to see it in yourself. Do you see under the skin?\u201d \nFried is asked to speak all over the country. He receives requests from Fraternities brothers who are worried others, schools with bullying problems, and much more. However, he always makes sure to tell his audiences to \u201cRemain teachable. When life hurts let it. We must give ourselves permission to lament the absence of a perfect life.\u201d SHARE ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott fried", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fried", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy olson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "annie russell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "abc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "std", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of rhode island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interfaith healing service", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:32.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cfa2d78d978cdf6e15205892b0520ea98432ee06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFe_BGcpXoC8W7ZLOS6rl_UgrVksTutw7XIKSDjTuU262QzrYgRwxaeqCYw5bT04tZWVrCU0BwE0grJ_N0TMfjAx.yfT8NTRY6NvFl6IgkWygpKgfc6LrhMxlGojfayUfW9dcm7x2MEovF4tqSd9lchuJRVAsy7U90lBjgiPmGdcWbbHHkKGJlXBxjvqTwAfL7WcIRg10qYwZnf0aCN9Df4JA8Z8FDmdiSOefO2vYU11sBuOBBfy.FSRg--", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/cardio-training-equipment/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Cardio Equipment -

Also, bonding with an insulating film such as silicon nitride (SiN) impairs thermal conductivity due to SiN\u2019s thermal resistance. \nFujitsu now reports that by protecting the surface of the diamond with an extremely thin metallic film it can prevent the formation of the damaged layer and bond single-crystal diamond to a SiC substrate at room-temperature. \nSimulations using actual measurements of thermal parameters have confirmed that devices using this technology would lower thermal resistance to 61% of existing one, the company says. \nThis technology promises GaN-HEMT power amps for transmitters to operate at higher power, and increase the observable range by roughly 1.5 times when applied to systems such as weather radar.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david manners", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fujitsu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hemt", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:32.039+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "462d8f1b0f3f6b95b8df98dd013d7a5cb3d0337d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye_Ipgkgp835LzH66fK3tqBG", "site_full": "texasfishingforum.com", "site": "texasfishingforum.com", "site_section": "http://texasfishingforum.com/forums/ubbthreads.php/forums/14/1/", "site_categories": ["saltwater_fishing", "freshwater_fishing", "fly_fishing", "sports"], "section_title": "Tournament Dates &amp; Information | Texas Fishing Forum", "title": "Adult/Youth tournaments", "title_full": "Adult/Youth tournaments | Tournament Dates & Information | Texas Fishing Forum", "published": "2017-12-04T01:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.344, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0b7742fe75e4e135551fbab8e789cd0590743cde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr7LUzpl3YeSmJfuTnyn13GsO9QfmP_LxYkIXGTcjltzczo.L22LmP7Oqoo1vcHye_Ipgkgp835L8uztF23BGnml4yYRyahkj0-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Ricky Bobby", "published": "2017-12-04T02:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "We could possibly do Palestine or Tyler as well.

The items we review are selected by our editors without bias. If you choose to purchase them from one of our preferred partners, we earn an affiliate commission that supports our work. Eggnog is a traditional holiday favorite, and there are many ways to upgrade it. Arina Habich / EyeEm \nHere at Organic Life , we love us some eggnog. The problem we encounter, however, is that after having one or two servings of this ultra-rich holiday drink, the carton often remains half-full in the back of the fridge until it goes bad\u2014after all, a little eggnog goes a long way, and it\u2019s not exactly the type of thing you crave on a daily basis. \nBut maybe that\u2019s because we\u2019ve been consuming it all wrong. Hear us out: Eggnog, while delicious straight up or with a splash of whiskey, has major untapped potential as an ingredient\u2014some people actually use it in French toast recipes to up the flavor. \nSo recently, we headed to the kitchen with a carton of our favorite eggnog, blared some Christmas tunes, and experimented with a few simple, unexpected, and totally delicious eggnog creations of our own that make it insanely easy to finish up every last drop. \nHere, four drool-worthy ways to upgrade your eggnog this holiday season. Stephanie Eckelkamp 1 Freeze it Into Cubes for an Iced Coffee Upgrade \nThe simplest way to upgrade your nog? Freeze into cubes (we recommend using a silicone mold for easy removal, like this one ), add to a glass, and top off with your favorite cold brew coffee for a creamy, sweet, and totally festive way to kick off your mornings. Stephanie Eckelkamp 2 Blend it into a Boozy Eggnog Milkshake \nEggnog\u2019s creamy, thick consistency is not unlike melted ice cream\u2014which makes it perfect for morphing into a delicious milkshake, preferably with a shot of whiskey or spiced rum to really get you in the holiday spirit. \nHow to make it: Add 6 or 7 eggnog ice cubes, 1 shot of liquor, and a splash of liquid eggnog to a blender and blend until mixture reaches a milkshake-like consistency. Feel free to adjust ratios to suit your tastes. \nSpeaking of booze, it can keep your water bottle from freezing in the cold: Advertisement Advertisement The items we review are selected by our editors without bias.

No boat captains that are not family at least. The current high school series seems more about how high my kid can place than anything else. It's great to get kids out fishing and many would not get to fish without the boat captains that volunteer. On the other hand when parents with boats seek out the best guys around, including local pro's, to do the tournaments it's kinda a joke to me. It's not surprising but it's hardly an even playing field. A lot of the parents and kids can flat out fish, that's fine and I like to see the teams win. It's the hiring out and only seeking out the top guys I'd like to see change. I'm not meaning to complain, would just like to see some changes or possibly other series where its a different format like your talking about.

Off limit periods. You can't hide a guide within 30 days of a tournament, guides cannot be boat captains and plenty more. It's fishing. There are no guarantees you're gonna catch anything even if you were to go with a guide. What I'm wanting to do is put together a few tournaments since we only fish one tournament per month. The more time they spend on the water the better.\nI know the rules very well, having pro's as boat captains or paying the top local guys big money is just something I think that should not be allowed. Just my opinion and it's happening. No, there still aren't any guarantees but when kids without boats that have never fished a lake finish in the top ten it's not about competition and who is the best. Most anyone that knows how to cast decently can catch when told where, when, what bait, etc. It's within the rules and we have the same opportunity so they are doing nothing wrong, I'd just like to see some rule changes, that's all. Yes, it would be hard to enforce just like the other rules. The two week \"no info rule\" is an example. People, buddies talk. It's a rule but unless it's posted online which just happened it's about impossible to enforce.\nI like the fact you want to add more tournaments. We have several members in our club that are wanting to fish some other series. Problem is the SETX requires the minimum $500 entry fee and we only have about three members willing to commit to that series. We are looking at other options, members are willing to travel.

VENTURA, Calif. , Dec. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- STARKART , the largest grocery cart advertising company in the U.S. and Canada , recently posted its original creative design entries for the CokexAdobexYou campaign to its Twitter and Instagram accounts, with the #cokexadobexyou hashtag. The CokexAdobexYou campaign is a benefit for the Special Olympics .\nSTARKART graphic designers, Pete Ibarra and Dennis Viloria , created special designs for the campaign, along with digital artists from around the world. To celebrate the creative community, Coca-Cola will make a one-time contribution of $35,000 to Special Olympics.\n\"I relate to being an adolescent that craves to be inspired and wants to win. The Special Olympics youth deserve to have the chance to be exposed to great opportunities,\" said Ibarra, the graphic designer responsible for spearheading the STARKART team's submissions for CokexAdobexYou .\nAdded Viloria, \"My design features a swimmer for sports, as I love water sports. I used clean, modern lines to create a flow of sports and movement. I also incorporated a Japanese rising sun effect, with the Asian family pattern for unity.\"\nIn honor of the campaign, Coca-Cola has shared the brand's iconic elements (i.e. its bottle, script, and shade of red) for artists to create a unique visual piece using Adobe Creative Cloud Tools. Participants are also encouraged to draw inspiration from the city of Tokyo, Japan , and other core elements such as a circle and the colors red and white when creating their designs on any app in the Adobe Creative Cloud.\n\"For my submission, I used pop art, texture experimentation, and street art feels to signify dimension and emotion,\" concluded Ibarra. \"It was a privilege to be able to use Coca-Cola classic design elements.\"\nAbout STARKART\nSTARKART has the largest shopping cart advertising network in the United States and Canada offering grocery cart advertising that reaches a network of thousands of locations.

However, spamming for the sake of being a negative nancy is not. If you don't have anything new to say, or anything that's relevant to the topic, kindly make your own thread or a different thread nagging.\nJust as a reminder: I will not be responding to any future comment you make because they're usually not worth the time of day. Forcing me to respond by spamming will result in spam report and an ignore, a function on the forums I thought I didn't ever have to use I responded back towards others quoting myself. If you consider open dialogue as spam then yeah I commented on this Topic almost as much as you yourself have.\nI never once disagreed w/ the Animation. If you would have Explained why it was that you created a Vid that a spoiled rotten child would make. I might have understood you better.\nNone of that even changes the point though. Due to your own Quoting of the Devs & trying to make an absolute idiot out of them by doing such. You pretty much sealed your own fate. They aint going to respond. Not today. Not tomorrow.\nNext time show some self control instead of throwing a tantrum fit over what someone else says. There are ways to get your point across to others. The way you chose to do such got you the attention you wanted. They fixed the Clipping. They probably didnt listen to a single point you tried to make beyond that. Your own fault. Not mine.

The FACT 10r carbon frame utilises less high-modulus carbon fibre than the range-topping S-Works, making it less stiff and slightly heavier although tube profiles and wind-cheating shapes stay the same. It sports aero-optimized tubing, a compact race design, and a tapered head tube and was designed to provide the ideal blend of light overall weight, stiffness, and responsiveness. \n\nThe frame and fork spent time in a wind-tunnel to optimize their aerodynamic shapes. Frame details include neat internal cable routing, a two-bolt seatpost clamp design, an aero seatpost (that can be flipped around for either 0mm or 20mm offset), and a BB30 CeramicSpeed bottom bracket. \nThe build Since our three month update, I have swapped out the saddle to my go-to favourite, the Specialized Power saddle . This one has a bit of twist though as it's the newly launched Arc Pro. The biggest difference between this one and the \"standard\" Power saddle is the arced sides that drop away for a more rounded profile. Although the Astute was comfortable and a good fit for my saddle area, the Power Arc Comp is in another league. I'm running this, the standard and their other new iteration, the Power Pro Elaston on a couple of bikes and we will be publishing a review in the new year to share some thoughts on the differences between the three models.\n\n\nThe original tyre of choice was Specialized's 700x23/25c Roubaix Tubeless tyres that allowed me to run them at the maximum allowed pressure without sacrificing comfort, thanks to the wider profile. The Roubaix later made way for a set of Bontrager R3 TLR 700x24 tubeless ready tyres, for no reason other than wanting to try out another tubeless set of tyres. Although I have not suffered a single puncture since April. It has been noticeable how longer the Bontrager tyres stay inflated, needing fewer air top-ups to keep them at an optimum running pressure. \n\n\nAmerican Classic's Argent tubeless has been exemplary. I have already done a review on them so won't go into too much detail again. The same goes for the SRAM RED eTap groupset and Quarq DZero drivetrain which we reviewed earlier the year. Since that review, the drivetrain has not skipped a beat and I'm happy to report that I've not been stranded at the side of the road unable to shift due to a flat battery or electronic glitch. \nI have become a big fan of ITM's X-One Bar thanks to its anatomic flat top that allows the palm of your hand to lie naturally on the grip, which helps relieve strain from your arms and hands when riding. The overall shape suits me to a T and was comfortable whether riding in the drops, hoods, or top.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "iwan kemp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bontrager", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "itm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "power pro elaston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "power arc comp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "roubaix", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:35.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c9e23ae36f0e1ab121b645eb475f61eccc2e0624", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n2bG8rqBNPeFPazCxoaZ0h25QYd7ADMjc9XAzjj5kzXGdEA3Gl6xeFGND5FQoe3I-", "site_full": "www.100-biker.com", "site": "100-biker.com", "site_section": "http://www.100-biker.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=13", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "New Member Introductions - 100% Biker &amp; Trike Magazine Forums", "title": "Hi ;)", "title_full": "Hi ;) - 100% Biker & Trike Magazine Forums", "published": "2017-07-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "24a14d062b486698481f4012efa1e7fbf9b8f9bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n2bG8rqBNPeFPazCxoaZ0h25QYd7ADMjc9XAzjj5kzXGdEA3Gl6xek_qarPRRSONtyWAPq3XwXQ--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "SS2", "published": "2017-11-29T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "They think we're friggin' daft don't they:rolleyes:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:35.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "beeb172c9211ec88516b5162536f82e959b29619", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm0diHggXa4znYDALxfATuqZ", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=android", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "android News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "iPhone market share slips in October-quarter: research firm | Reuters", "title_full": "iPhone market share slips in October-quarter: research firm | Reuters : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-12-05T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "beeb172c9211ec88516b5162536f82e959b29619", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm0diHggXa4znYDALxfATuqZ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters", "published": "2017-12-05T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "iPhone market share slips in October-quarter: research firm | Reuters", "text": "(Reuters) - The unavailability of the iPhone X during the three months ended October pulled down the market share for Apple\u2019s iPhones in some key regions, while phones running on Google\u2019s Android recorded higher sales, data from a research firm showed on Tuesday.

Nowadays, multimodal management, including surgery, chemotherapy (CMT), and radiation therapy (RT), is advocated. However, AT/RT treatment with gamma knife surgery (GKS) was rarely reported. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of GKS for the treatment of AT/RT.\nPatients and methods Medical records of AT/RT patients who underwent surgery from 2007 to 2014 at the West China Hospital were retrospectively reviewed and statistically analyzed.\nResults Eighteen patients (12 males and 6 females) were presented with AT/RTs. Median age during presentation was 20.5 months (range, 4\u2013179 months). Twelve patients were <\u20093 years and six patients were >\u20093 years. Tumor location was supratentorial in seven patients, infratentorial in ten patients, and center area of the brain in one patient. Treatments performed were as follows: surgery alone in two patients, surgery+RT in two patients, surgery+CMT in five patients, surgery+CMT+RT in two patients, and surgery+CMT+RT+GKS in seven patients. The 2-year overall survival (OS) rate and event-free survival (EFS) rate for all 18 consecutive patients were 33.3 and 27.8%, respectively. Cox regression analyses showed that multimodal management combined with GKS was an independent positive prognostic factor for OS.\nConclusions Although AT/RTs are lethal cancer types, the OS of the disease was improved by using multimodal therapeutic strategies, including surgery, CMT, and RT, combined with GKS.\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2kuZ7U3\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cmt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gks", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "west china hospital", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:32:35.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e8c299cc77c40ea7227213f3e9a7ebdfec55f64a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TQ7a.DNpeCxKqStgtVkx83GwkhGPL0kfvpQ.Fqwqu1rKbHjcsHxvWf", "site_full": "airasilver.tumblr.com", "site": "tumblr.com", "site_section": "http://airasilver.tumblr.com/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "My Life, No One Else's.", "title": "Do you think Meghan and Prince Harry will last?

Thanks to music videos and songs like \u201cI love College\u201d by Asher Roth, students looking at going to college tend to be focused on party schools and drinking. \nThis past semester Rowan has had 48 alcohol violations between the months of September through December. \n\u201cSounds close to our numbers,\u201d said Reed Layton, director of the Department of Public Safety. Layton deals with the violations with the help of the community standards department. \n\u201cThey would be issued a summons, and have to make a payment in court and disciplined on campus also,\u201d Layton said. \nThe violations take place all over campus. Some of the violations are specified as underage possession of alcohol, but not all of them. Other examples of alcohol violations could include public intoxication and can sometimes tie in with citations for urinating in public. \nThere are some places mentioned more than others when it comes to where the violations take place.

I'm someone who doesn't risk anything.'' \nThe 31-year-old actress' house could still emerge from the wildfires unscathed, but Lea wasn't willing to take any risks with her own safety. \nInstead, the brunette beauty decided to seek shelter at the home of 'Fashion Police' co-host Brad Goreski . \nLea told E! News: ''I'd rather just be safe so I packed everything up and I went to Brad Goreski's house. Everything will be fine but it's just better to be safe than sorry.'' \nThis comes shortly after Lea admitted she loves living in California because it allows her to exercise in the outdoors. \nThe New York-born star explained: ''What's super easy for me is hiking because I live near some really great trails. I can literally get in my car, drive for less than a minute and be on the top of a mountain 20 minutes later. \n''It is so spiritually incredible as well as physically - I look for workouts that have to be also good for my spirit as much as they are for my body. I can't be at a gym with crazy music playing and people looking at themselves in the mirror.''

To improve the collaboration, CPAA Theaters under the endorsement of the Ministry of Culture of Chinese established the Silk Road International League of Theaters (SRILT) in 2016. This year, Ciputra Artpreneur joined the league as the first member from Indonesia. \nThe SRILT is an open and inclusive organization that is more than willing to cooperate in diversifying product types, planning the schedule for future development, and proactively coordinating developing schemes with member units. The league which was initiated by CPAA theaters has attracted 56 international organizations, theaters, and cultural organizations from 21 countries as its members. \nCiputra Artpreneur, with its international standard facilities, is regarded suitable to join SRILT this year. It shares similar goals with CPPA Theaters, which are introducing arts to the wider public and encouraging the cultural developments. \nThe cooperation means that there will be more diverse performances, exhibition, and cultural activities from the Silk Road countries at Ciputra Artpreneur.
