It\u2019s not that simple | Shashank Joshi Read more \n\u201cI do not believe that any terrorist, whether they come from this country or any other, should ever be allowed back into this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should do everything we can do to destroy and eliminate that threat.\u201d\nWilliamson said jihadist groups in Libya, Iraq and Syria were breeding grounds for plotting attacks in the UK. \u201cOur job in terms of eliminating will not stop this year, will not stop next year \u2013 it is something we have got to continue to pursue,\u201d he said. \nHis remarks put him at odds with the head of the terrorism watchdog, who recently said the UK could attempt to reintegrate young and naive jihadists who wanted to return to the UK. \nMax Hill, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, warned of the danger of \u201closing a generation\u201d of men and women by automatically using the courts to punish them. \nMore than 800 UK citizens are thought to have gone to fight for Isis in Iraq and Syria, including teenagers, women and young families.\n\nProfile Who is Gavin Williamson? Show Hide Before Westminster \nBorn in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, he had a comprehensive education before going on to gain a degree in social science at the University of Bradford. Williamson then worked for a while in the pottery industry and for an architectural design firm before being elected MP for South Staffordshire in 2010 at the age of 33.\nThe rapid rise Just a few years after his election, Williamson became David Cameron\u2019s parliamentary aide, acting as his eyes and ears among MPs. But when Cameron stepped down, Williamson quickly threw his lot in with Theresa May as the most effective stop-Boris candidate and was adopted as her campaign manager. Having impressed with his organisational skills, he was elevated to  chief whip, despite not having previously served as a minister.\nDefence secretary After becoming pivotal in the deal with the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), Williamson earned May's respect for managing difficult parliamentary votes with the slimmest of DUP-backed majorities. His move into the cabinet after Sir  Michael Fallon  resigned over allegations of sexual harassment appears to position him as a potential Conservative leader, but the backlash among MPs was significant.\nSpider man He is best known in Westminster for keeping a tarantula called Cronus in a glass box on his desk, seemingly to intimidate MPs who have stepped out of line. The creature is named after the Greek god who came to power by castrating his own father before eating his own children to ensure they would not oust him.\nIn his own words \u201cI don\u2019t very much believe in the stick, but it\u2019s amazing what can be achieved with a sharpened carrot.\u201d\nWas this helpful? \n\nThank you for your feedback. \u201cWe have got to make sure that as [they] splinter and as they disperse across Iraq and Syria and other areas, we continue to hunt them down,\u201d he said. \u201cMake sure there is no safe space for them, that they can\u2019t go to other countries preaching their hate, preaching their cult of death.\u201d\nWilliamson defended himself telling Friday\u2019s Daily Mail: \u201cThe British people want to make sure that our streets are safe. The British people are incredibly proud of our armed forces, the work they do - making sure that the people who are a threat to this country are not able to continue to threaten this country. That\u2019s what the British people want to know that their Government is doing. That is what we will continue to do.\u201d \nThe foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, delivered a speech on Thursday on British efforts to tackle terrorism, including hitting back at suggestions from the EU Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, that the vote to leave the bloc had meant Britain had decided to take a step back from co-operation.\n\n\u201cEvery day around the world I can tell you that British serving men and women are putting their lives at risk to roll up terrorist networks, to expose what they are doing, to thwart them and bring them to justice,\u201d he will say.\n\u201cThey are making good on what the prime minister has rightly called the unconditional commitment of the British people to the security of our European friends, not just in this continent but beyond.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david cameron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barnier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael fallon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavin williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shashank joshi read", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boris johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michel barnier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "isis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "daily mail", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cronus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic unionist party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of bradford", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south staffordshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westminster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarborough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north yorkshire", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:47.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "761a334f7d98ca056441e5de7eba01b996452bba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.q1zykyvBfpRbJbllQcOcmX5ks80b4jbounVi9TDCv40LsztvArJQCgB7b1Q8gsOKkUL92v.a58MfHRJzEa762cuj457jBByMymMPxb6dBtxTZtX.M4EPumkysfwTA1rLEaaO9NEGk76S5GxDRjEcCFhOIrfZjvhQSrJRPppW35vrRNddgtsQrMzsPUN_kS7FjsKbYqTdrCIXmXUPOhdfJ", "site_full": "www.hostingdiscussion.com", "site": "hostingdiscussion.com", "site_section": "http://www.hostingdiscussion.com/vps-hosting-offers/", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult", "internet_technology"], "section_title": "VPS Hosting Offers - Hosting Discussion", "title": "$14.97 per year (recurring discount), Unmanaged VPS, Very Dependable, limited offer!", "title_full": "$14.97 per year (recurring discount), Unmanaged VPS, Very Dependable, limited offer! - Hosting Discussion", "published": "2017-12-07T11:17:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "761a334f7d98ca056441e5de7eba01b996452bba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.q1zykyvBfpRbJbllQcOcmX5ks80b4jbounVi9TDCv40LsztvArJQCgB7b1Q8gsOKkUL92v.a58MfHRJzEa762cuj457jBByMymMPxb6dBtxTZtX.M4EPumkysfwTA1rLEaaO9NEGk76S5GxDRjEcCFhOIrfZjvhQSrJRPppW35vrRNddgtsQrMzsPUN_kS7FjsKbYqTdrCIXmXUPOhdfJ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Forward Web", "published": "2017-12-07T11:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "$14.97 per year (recurring discount), Unmanaged VPS, Very Dependable, limited offer!", "text": "** Big RECURRING Promo on VPS Hosting: 50% off all VPS web hosting plans (Good for the life of your account), limited spots available so act fast!.

Then I went on to marry one (or maybe more, the jury is still out on a few relationships). Once I managed to remove the abuser from my current life (as much as possible \u2013 it\u2019s still in progress), I did my research.\nA running joke amongst survivors is that we never set out to get a psychology degree. Yet, we likely know more about such things than those who have their doctorate. Personal experience is a harsh taskmaster on the learning curve.\nThe narcissistic, sociopathic, dark triad, machiavellian, manipulator is not to be trifled with. Don\u2019t get me wrong. We don\u2019t want to assign any great powers to them. We don\u2019t want to make people afraid or give them any more ego than they already have. But the fact remains, by the time any of us come into the \u201cgame\u201d, the abuser has already set in motion myriads of scenarios, stories, lies, triangulations, et al and we are just dipping our toes.\nChoose your battles carefully. You don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. These sorts of creatures have been living their whole lives setting up things to make them look like a victim or hero or whatever their current need is. And they do some serious damage in the lives of pretty much anyone with whom they come into contact. And if you happen to have a more intimate relationship? Well, may god have mercy on your soul.\nAs a survivor, I know first hand and only too well how this plays out. But by the time I discovered any of the behind-the-scenes footage, the damage was already done and there was zero hopes of fixing it.\nThe maternal used me as a life-long scapegoat. She had plenty for which she should be ashamed. But by claiming she had a dark sheep that lied and told terrible stories about her, she was able to sidestep many possible confrontations. Little did she know, I didn\u2019t even bother to tell anyone anything. I had been brainwashed into silence. It\u2019s only recently that I\u2019ve managed to set my tongue free.\nThen there\u2019s the ea (evil asshole). Even things that he totally fucked up, end up being twisted until they are able to be seen as my doing. And it still goes on.\nI have a ridiculous sense of justice. It twists my knickers when someone does something evil and gets away with it. So, in some ways I suffer twice from these mind games and manipulations. I have to take myself back to my own center and remember that if someone is going to believe these master liars, there is nothing to be done. I\u2019ll have to live with being seen as whatever the hell my current image is set at and just know that I am not that.\nBut I hate being accused of something I haven\u2019t done. And that was a theme that played long and hard throughout my life. This is where my spiritual path has been of help. The only person who can know me is me. The only person who can help me be who I really am is me. There\u2019s a theme here.\nThe more I trust myself (and this is essential in recovery from such abuse), the less the others\u2019 opinions matter. The crazy making (gaslighting) starts to lose its hold. The more we trust ourselves the less the abusers can mess with us. Oh, yes, they\u2019ll still wreak havoc in the world out there\u2026and for most, that\u2019s going to sting more than necessary. But those who know us will love us and stand by us. If someone abandons you because they believe the abuser, you\u2019re better off without them.\nCheck your abandonment issues. Work on your self esteem. Write out all of the things that piss you off and all of the lies that you want to counter. But do it for yourself. If you let anyone else have any kind of power over you, even just the power of their opinion, you are just weighing yourself down like Marley\u2019s chains. (note gratuitous xmas reference)\nWe have enough to deal with while we heal. Poking the narcissist is just going to give you anxiety and heartburn. The masses who have survived this sort of thing preach No Contact for a reason. I have held fast to it best I can. I only ever interact with the ea because I have to for whatever reason. My goal is to soon have no reason to do even that. But until then, the less I say the better and the less ammunition for use against me.\nWe all want to take a stand against evil (well, maybe not all of us, but some of us just have a hard time letting it go), but remember you are not playing on level ground. This is chess, not checkers. And the deck is stacked (yes, mixing metaphors is a specialty of mine).\nIf you need to research, here are a few things to stick in your google bar:\nspartan life coach thriving after abuse dark triad triangulation flying monkeys covert narcissist ambient abuse Just a few sites and terms that will help you defend yourself if necessary. And it begins with some healing. You can\u2019t go into battle unarmed and unarmored. First, you need to do your research and heal the wounds already inflicted. Then, if you are so moved, then you plan your line of attack. Not everyone wants to fight or has the energy to do so. Some of us just need to survive. However you choose to live this, go well and hang tough. The more we know the less they can move forward. And, in time, they can be exposed\u2026hopefully saving someone else this particular war wound.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:48.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a8b534a11c32c568f0e73355016641f62816aa8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Gl4pMVfIy_NnlmiyLHpA3mB_o47I9v2dTKG3f.Zhi.581EQTz_pIANmg3m1t5iO0-", "site_full": "www.gistmania.com", "site": "gistmania.com", "site_section": "http://www.gistmania.com/talk/board,14.480/sort,last_post/desc.html", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Naijapals Base (Metro life) (Page 13) - Gistmania", "title": "OH LA LA!

But this isn't really what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a book/pdf which actually is creating a fromal system and is working in it (as rigorous as possible, ofcourse it can't contain a formal proof for everything but there should be some in it). It should also at some point define the ordinals in the system (and addition, multiplication... of them). Your answer about definitorial expansion looks interesting, I will look into it! \u2013 owo Apr 7 at 12:09 @owo: It is hard to find such a book because most mathematicians and logicians are comfortable working with natural language, as long as they can be sure what they do can be translated into a suitable formal system, usually ZFC for modern mathematics. I know you're looking for a more explicitly formal kind, but actually as long as you fully grasp the notion of definitorial expansion, you will be able to mentally formalize what you read. \u2013 user21820 Apr 8 at 7:43 @owo: I also realize that I missed one point in your question about having no free variables. I personally prefer that style, and if you're interested you can look up my description of one Fitch-style system that enforces every variable to be bound and also no variable shadowing.

Do You Know These 24 Herbs & Spices That Kill Pain Fast? Wellness Written By: Ria Majumdar Published: Thursday, December 7, 2017, 13:33 [IST] \nSynthetic chemicals and drugs are just a product of the scientific advances of the 20th century. \nBut before that, human beings chiefly relied on the power of herbs and spices to cure their various ailments, including pain. \nFrom simple toothaches to aborting unwanted pregnancies, we used to turn to witch doctors and medicine women for their knowledge of nature's bounty. And though the religious crusades of the previous centuries tried their best to destroy this ancient wisdom, the knowledge has survived till the 21st century, where naturopathic cures are making a comeback like never before! \nSo, if you are looking for a simple way to get rid of your pain (whether back, knee, or tooth), read on because in this article we have listed out 24 amazing herbs and spices that can help you kill pain fast. #1 Aloe Vera \nCool, soothing, and packed with healing nutrients, the gel contained within aloe vera leaves is a potent painkiller and healer of wounds. And there are two ways you can reap these effects. \nOne, by applying the gel over your external wounds, like over burns (up to second-degree skin burns), cuts, scrapes, or sores. \nAnd two, by ingesting aloe vera juice (prepared by diluting its gel in a glass of water) to heal internal wounds caused by conditions like ulcerative colitis, peptic ulcers, and oral aphthous stomatitis. #2 Arnica \nArnica is a herb native to Siberia and Central Europe and has been used since the 1500s to heal muscle pain, sprains, bruises, and contusions through external salves applied over the site. \nPlease note: Arnica should not be ingested, as it can lead to diarrhoea, vomiting, shortness of breath, and death. #3 Turmeric \nTurmeric is one of the most powerful anti-inflammatory spices in the world because of its chief constituent, curcumin. \nFrom healing wounds externally to treating cough and cold when ingested with milk, turmeric is a famous medicinal plant in India. \nJust remember to use it in conjunction with a pinch of black pepper, as the compound piperine in the latter increases the bioavailability of turmeric by almost 2000%! \nRELATED - Surprising Benefits of Drinking Turmeric Milk Everyday #4 Basil \nBasil is more famous for its presence on top of pizzas and in tomato sauces, but what you may not know is that basil is a very powerful painkiller. In fact, ingesting basil can reduce arthritic pain and swelling by almost 73% in under 24 hours. #5 Ginger \nGinger belongs to the same family of herbs as turmeric, and derives its medicinal properties from its chief constituent, gingerol. \nIn fact, studies have shown that ginger is as effective as tricyclic antidepressants in treating migraine headaches and is also very useful in treating the pain of osteomyelitis (a.k.a, jaw sepsis). \nRELATED - We Bet You Don't Know These Amazing Health Benefits of Ginger! #6 Black Pepper \nThe chief medicinal compound in black pepper is piperine. And besides its most common use alongside turmeric to increase the latter's bioavailability, black pepper can also be used to increase your pain threshold, so you feel less pain in case of a wound or inflammation. #7 Nutmeg \nNutmeg is a common spice added to food. But what you may not know is that it is also used popularly in Traditional Chinese medicine to treat abdominal pain and inflammation. #8 Cayenne Pepper \nCayenne pepper is a very hot chilli pepper that contains the compound capsaicin in it, which is also found in capsicum (a.k.a, bell peppers). And this compound is known to reduce the amount of substance-P that is secreted by your body when you feel a painful stimulus, thus reducing your pain perception. #9 Mustard \nButterflies love mustard plants. And after you read this point, you will too because mustard seeds contain within them powerful medicinal compounds that are very effective against muscle pain, chest congestions, respiratory disorders, and also ringworm infections. \nJust prepare a poultice out of crushed mustard seeds and apply it over the painful site to reap its painkilling benefits. \nRELATED - Do You Know The Benefits of Mustard Seeds For Our Health?

But that's not all cinnamon can do. \nOther medicinal properties of this spice includes its ability to kill microbes, especially in the urinary and digestive tracts, and fungi-causing athlete's foot. #11 Cloves \nCloves contain a powerful painkilling substance in them called eugenol. In fact, it is so potent that it is an integral part of temporary dental cements commonly used to soothe severe toothache between appointments. #12 Garlic \nGarlic pods might be stinky, but they are very effective at treating various ailments. \nIn fact, studies have shown that raw, crushed garlic's inflammation-reducing and painkilling properties are comparable to the OTC painkiller ibuprofen. \nRELATED - Surprising Facts and Benefits of Garlic You Probably Didn't Know #13 Celery Seeds \nCelery's characteristic taste, smell, and medicinal properties are an attribute of the chemical compound 3-N-butylphthalide in it. And it is more concentrated in the seeds than the stalk. \nAnd while consuming celery seeds won't help you in all types of painful conditions, it is exceptionally good at reducing gout pain. #14 Sage \nSage is commonly burned by herbalists and witch doctors to cleanse the atmosphere before rituals. But what you may not know is that this herb is a very effective remedy for sore throats, gum disease, respiratory disorders, and mouth ulcers. \nIn fact, you can even use it to get rid of toothaches by soaking two tablespoons of the dried herb for a few minutes in a cup of water with 2 spoons of sea salt and then rinsing your mouth with it for at least 1-2 minutes. #15 Chamomile \nChamomile is a pretty flower known for its soothing effect on your mind and nerves, which is why people who suffer from anxiety are often recommended to have one cup of it every day. \nThis sleep-inducing and calming effects of chamomile are because of the presence of flavonoids and terpenoids in it, which is also effective at relieving menstrual pain, muscle spasms, ulcer pains, and pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis and hemorrhoids. \nRELATED - 21 Best Foods to Eat During Your Period #16 Rosemary \nRosemary is a great insect repellent.

RELATED - Add a Glass of Coriander Juice to Your Diet and See What Happens #19 Licorice \nLicorice is an odd root used to produce special teas and candies in the western part of the world. And while all types of it are not medicinal, the DGL licorice root (deglycyrrhizinated licorice) is a very powerful herbal remedy for peptic ulcers, mouth sores, and acid reflux, when used as a mouthwash or drunk in the form of a tea. \nPlus, applying it topically in the form of a salve can reduce eczema-induced itches. #20 Neem \nThe neem tree is every Ayurvedic doctor's favourite because from its root to leaves, every single part of it is medicinal in some way or another. \nAnd, besides, its analgesic properties when applied topically in the form of a paste over painful wounds and itching areas, it is a powerful antimicrobial agent capable of destroying herpes infection, cold sores, stomach ulcers, and intestinal worms when ingested in the form of a herbal tea. \nRELATED - 5 Incredible Health Benefits of Bathing With Neem Water #21 Oregano \nOregano trumps apples in terms of antioxidant action by over 4200%!

The 3 bed-semi and kids etc. It was great of course and I have no regrets over the years . Well perhaps just a few ! However since I was diagnosed with Cancer it changed my life. I feel perhaps in some ways for the better of course I would have preferred not to get ill.\nHowever what you come to relies that life is short and we never know what is around the corner. Its made me think what is important in life ? Its not material things its family and good friends and being happy.\nI have known quite a few friends taken much to early through illness,Accident,Suicide. The latter shocked me the most in many ways. In the modern world we all face many pressure\u2019s of life and perhaps we can reduce these pressures if we really want to. I am pretty convinced the modern western lifestyle can be detrimental to health. There have been huge increases in stress related illness. I never new how stressed I used to get at work at times.\nIt is true we are living longer if you reach old age mostly though by drugs. However I am not sure I would want to end up like my dad in a nursing home wearing a nappy and not knowing where i was to me that is not living.\nWe are conditioned in the modern world to have this and that with huge peer pressure to have the latest things and spend money often leading to large debt. It seems we are conditioned to be in debt from a young age. We then have to work longer hours etc to maintain payments and as long as you can pay that debt its ok. Its when things go wrong then the problems start and today in the UK poverty and homelessness is actually on the increase. We have seen huge increases in mental health issues over recent years often related to lifestyle and work.\nI have been lucky and able to take an early retirement and become debt free for the first time since I left school pretty much. I owe nothing to any one and have a little money not a lot but enough if we are careful. I work part time and that gives us enough money for food and essentials. I wish I had not followed the crowd and not been conditioned to debt. It is possible to change ones life and perhaps kick the normal lifestyle if we so wish.\nAs my wage increased we moved to a larger house and had a newer vehicle. I could of if I had wished I had stayed in a smaller house and not had the newer cars. I would have paid my debt off much sooner and been able to choose my lifestyle.\nWe have have now moved to a modest two bedroom cottage now yep it has a large garden but the interior is small. This was two cottages many years ago. I think it was most likely a miners or clay workers cottages. In those days most had quite large families and they managed quite well. Again its what we are conditioned to have. If you like we have gone full circle as we started married life in a two up and two down cottage.\nI find also its often the simplest things that can give the greatest pleasure in life. We are on a journey and really no ones knows where it will end up. I am not going to say we should do this or that we have to make our own life choice. I could get all political but I wont. In some ways I work harder now than when I was in full time employment. I do however feel fulfilled most days. I have come to relies we should work to live not live to work we really need only a few things shelter,food and water and clothing its that simple. I feel happier now than I have done for years.\nWe live well mostly fresh food and avoid processed food. I now go to a local Fruit and veg shop and buy smaller amounts of fruit and veg ie what we need. This reduces waste and is cheaper. The same with meat comes from a local butcher and again you only buy what you need.\nI am also on the look out for wood as we use a log burner to provide most of the heating in the home. This is provided free in most cases in the forms of pallet wood. I have found many places are only to happy for you to take broken pallets from them. It takes a little time to process but that is half the fun in my view.\nIn conclusion its everyone\u2019s life choices but I would say perhaps look and not follow the crowd and look at some of the alternatives out there.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:49.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d7787181ba010eade3e81c91ce83be879ddeff10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pwYVyQ48uVCciNemPJp3MaWQ0NZ_73Bai", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/mu/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/mu/ - Music - 4chan", "title": "holy fuck", "title_full": "/mu/ - holy fuck - Music - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T11:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.075, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "411e8d24de6aca6a2297eb331a3879058ecf84c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pwYVyQ48uVCciNemPJp3MafONb0HXCdzn.XCebp8H9Hs-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T11:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Check out Us by Peter Gabriel.

Service members, families and friends gathered at sunset around the USS Utah Memorial on historic Ford Island to honor victims of the Pearl Harbor attacks with a ceremony and interment service, Dec. 6. A sunset ceremony is held every year to pay tribute to the crew of the USS Utah, and often, to inter the ashes of survivors recently passed, so that they may be united with their shipmates already entombed inside the sunken vessel. \u201cEach year we gather to honor the 58 Sailors who lost their lives when the USS Utah was hit by two Japanese torpedoes, one of the first ships to go down in Pearl Harbor that day, and we remember their sacrifice,\u201d said Jacqueline Ashwell, superintendent of the World War II Valor in the Pacific and Honolulu National Monuments. Ashwell opened the ceremony by recounting the harrowing story of Peter Tomich, a U.S. Navy Sailor stationed onboard the Utah at the time of the attack. \u201cWe remember the valor of men such as Peter Tomich, who, after realizing the ship was capsizing, did not run for safety, but instead decided to stay at his post. He knew if he could stabilize the boilers, a lot of people would be able to escape with their lives,\u201d said Ashwell. \u201cSo he stayed and allowed for others to go on to fulfill long lives. Today is particularly special. Today we celebrate the lives of two men who were able to escape the capsizing of the ship that you see behind me, thanks to the teamwork of Tomich and other shipmates.\u201d This year, LCDR Clark J. Simmons and Aviation Machinist\u2019s Mate Harry Hohstadt joined their fellow crewmembers interred in the waters of the Utah. Both crewmembers rose to the challenge and overcame great obstacles on that day, and the subsequent years to come. \u201cMy dad loved Pearl Harbor and he loved the USS Utah. He brought me here for the first time when I was very young,\u201d said Claudette Simmons, daughter of Clark Simmons. \u201cWhen I look at this place, I know he\u2019s home, and I know that God has him now.\u201d Simmons joined the Navy in 1939, a time when segregation was in full effect, making it difficult to move ahead in many career fields, including the Navy. Simmons did not let this deter him from his goals. He received a Purple Heart after being shot during his escape from the Utah, and after serving for 29 years, retired from the U.S. Navy as a Lieutenant Commander. Hohstadt was also no stranger to adversity, being the youngest of nine children during the Great Depression. After the assault on the Utah, he saw action in many subsequent battles including the pivotal struggle for Guadalcanal in Nov. 1942. After being honorably discharged from the Navy, Hohstadt went on to start a large family, and owned his own business for 40 years. \u201cMy dad would have been especially impressed with the young people, because he loved to see young people go into the service and serve their country,\u201d Teresa Teague said of her father Harry. \u201cHe also would have been quite taken with the officers because he was enlisted, and to see all the officers here to honor him, he would have been quite taken by their support.\u201d During the ceremony Ashwell, took the time out to recognize one more U.S. Sailor, who has also volunteered to rise to a unique challenge presented at Pearl Harbor. Retired Master Chief Jim Taylor has been a volunteer liaison and friend to the Pearl Harbor Survivors and their families for many years, and was commemorated for his work at the ceremony. \u201cToday, we also would like to honor the man that does the honors, a man who has been here for 20 years, steadfast, to honor all of those who choose to return to Pearl Harbor when they die,\u201d said Ashwell. \u201cFor the past eight years, Jim Taylor has been here to coordinate events for our Pearl Harbor survivors and ensure that the USS Utah is not a forgotten ship. The employees of the U.S. National Park Service have enjoyed partnering with you over all these years, and we have learned a great deal from you as well. We will continue in this partnership to ensure that the USS Utah is never a forgotten ship. That is our promise, that is our vow.\u201d The 76th anniversary events of the attacks on Pearl Harbor and Oahu, co-hosted by the U.S. Military, the National Park Service and the State of Hawaii, will provide veterans, family members, service members and the community a chance to honor the sacrifices made by those who were present Dec. 7, 1941, as well as throughout the Pacific theater.

Get Your Calcium Need From These Foods Nutrition By: Needhi Gandhi Published: Thursday, December 7, 2017, 11:01 [IST] \nCalcium is an essential mineral that strengthens the bones and teeth of the human body. Hence, people need to include a sufficient amount of calcium in their regular diet to keep themselves fit. Generally, milk is considered to be the richest source of calcium and a glass of milk is known to contain almost 300 mg of calcium. \nSo, the kids are mostly forced to drink at least one glass of milk every day, as they need a lot of calcium for the development of their bones and dental strength. \nBut many children and even the adults do not really like to have milk, in spite of its high calcium supply to their bodies. A few people also may not have milk due to the presence of lactose in it, since they are lactose intolerant and cannot digest it. \nAlso, milk may not be available in every part of the world, to fulfill the necessary doses of calcium for the people. \nSo, the alternative source of calcium is long hunted by the scientists and dietitians. Now a number of other foods are known that are enriched with more calcium content than a glass of milk. Continue reading to know more about these foods. Chickpeas: \nThe roasted chickpea is a favourite food of many people when it is served as a part of a tasty salad or soup. It is found that one and a half cups of chickpeas contains 315 mg of calcium and a lot of fibre, as well as protein. So, it can easily serve as an alternative source of calcium. Oats: \nThe oats are known to be a very healthy cereal and it is also found to be a rich source of calcium, along with fibres, vitamin B and other important nutrients. According to the dietitians, only half a cup of oats contain 200 mg of calcium that is more than the similar quantity of milk. Moreover, oats are usually consumed with soya milk or almond milk, both of which are tastier alternatives of cow milk and are richer sources of calcium. Tofu: \nAs soya milk is a rich source of calcium, tofu or the bean curd prepared from soya milk is known to be a tastier alternative to milk for very high calcium supply. It is seen that a cup of firm tofu supplies 861 mg of calcium that is more than enough for any child or adult, along with a good content of protein and fibre. Almonds: \nAlmond is the most popular variety of nuts that is loved by young and old. The research has established that only a \u00beth cup of this healthy nut contains 320 mg of calcium and thus it can easily replace the milk for the kids. Moreover, almond is also known to be beneficial for improving the brain power in growing children. Salmon: \nSalmon is a tasty sea fish that is known to be a very healthy food. It is found that only one serving of fresh or canned salmon can supply approximately 350 mg of calcium. Moreover, it also has a rich content of vitamin D that is essential for the calcium absorption in body cells. This fish also provides a lot of omega-3 fatty acids and protein, which help in keeping the body healthier. Sardines: \nSardine is another healthy sea fish, a small serving of which contains 370 mg of calcium. Like other seafood varieties, sardines also contain omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D that are necessary for the good health of any person. So tasty dishes prepared of these sea fishes should be included in the meals as often as possible. Green Leafy Vegetables: \nThe fresh green leafy vegetables are always the first suggestion of any dietitian or doctor for a healthy vegetarian meal. Spinach, kale, turnip greens, bok choy and mustard leaves are known to be the great sources of calcium. It is seen that 2 cups of turnip greens contain 394 mg of calcium, while a similar quantity of kale provides 188 mg of calcium. So the salads, green smoothie and tasty cuisines made of these vegetables wonderfully replace the necessity of milk consumption. Dried Figs: \nThe dry fig is a popular sweet dry fruit that is generally added to the cornflakes or oats to make it a tastier breakfast meal. One and a half cups of dried figs supply 320 mg of calcium, along with a large content of healthy antioxidants. Ricotta Cheese: \nRicotta is a popular form of creamy cheese that is widely used in making tasty desserts with various sweet fruits. The dietitians recommend this cheese because a 3/4th cup of ricotta cheese is found to contain 380 mg of calcium and 21 g of proteins, making it an ideal food for the fast growth of children. \nHence, all these healthy foods perfectly provide a balanced diet with lots of calcium, for which the daily intake of cow's milk can be skipped.

The dementia beds being serviced by an intensive community team that would care for people as required wherever their needs could be met. \nThe Trust has said that after exploring business cases the 4th option would be its preference. \nInterim Director of Mental Health, Kevin Bond told Isle of Wight Radio: \n\u201cA lot of the environments are very inappropriate for the jobs they do, so a lot more changes need to come to the units.

7th December 2017 \nA group of medical experts have warned the regulation of vaginal mesh products is \"inadequate\" and devices have been brought to market without clinical trials. \nProfessor Carl Heneghan from Oxford University, who specialises in evidence-based medicine, has called for a patient registry to be set up to look at the long-term evidence of mesh complications. \nThe report, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), echoes the findings of a Sky News investigation in October which reported on how mesh had been used without trials and was causing harm to women on a scale bigger then Thalidomide. \nThe BMJ study looked at the regulation of vaginal mesh products in the US and was unable to scrutinise the approval process in Europe because of a lack of accessibility. \nProfessor Heneghan and his team traced marketing clearance for 61 mesh devices and found they were based on equivalence to only two existing products that were approved in 1985 and 1996, despite important changes having been made to the models. \nTheir results show no evidence of clinical trial data at the time the device was approved. \nThe authors of the report argue changes in design should have alerted regulators to important differences in the technological characteristics of the mesh that should have negated the use of equivalence. \nWhen evidence has been forthcoming, it has often emerged too late to inform clinical practice, they wrote. \nThe current systems for ensuring patient safety are inadequate for medical devices. \nWe think that clinical trials evidence should be mandatory for marketing authorisation of implantable devices. \nIn response to the increasing recognition of problems with mesh, many countries including Australia have reclassified them as high risk. \nThe UK watchdog NICE will soon publish new guidelines recommending transvaginal mesh should not be used to treat prolapse because of safety concerns. \nResponding to the findings, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said that while they recognise some women do develop serious complications\u2026 We also know many women gain benefit from these surgical procedures for what can be extremely debilitating conditions. \nEarlier this year in an interview with Sky News the MHRA said: There was no evidence from a regulatory point of view that mesh devices were inherently unsafe. \nThe MHRA insist the complication rate of vaginal mesh implants is between one and three percent. \nThat is despite latest NHS figures obtained by Sky News showing it to be at least 10%.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "carl heneghan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heneghan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nhs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british medical journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sky news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mhra", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:53.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e8a15a73c3e9b305a7833bdee2210bb9158f3f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powGR6tzybr2NJMlGlAihy7ZURr0Fqfe0rChFr_YrqhhGzhnvaM2Q6UhnrpRyBuBj_dwsS9BxmeK6xlOkNHJbvgI4fYnorfL25t9FbpL8KSEXWtdJByLped0px_S1r_H_r0-", "site_full": "iwradio.co.uk", "site": "iwradio.co.uk", "site_section": "http://iwradio.co.uk/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Isle Of Wight Radio", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence \u2018afraid\u2019 of sexy scenes after nude photo hack", "title_full": "Jennifer Lawrence \u2018afraid\u2019 of sexy scenes after nude photo hack", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://iwradio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/skynews-elle-women-in-hollywood_4130404.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0e8a15a73c3e9b305a7833bdee2210bb9158f3f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powGR6tzybr2NJMlGlAihy7ZURr0Fqfe0rChFr_YrqhhGzhnvaM2Q6UhnrpRyBuBj_dwsS9BxmeK6xlOkNHJbvgI4fYnorfL25t9FbpL8KSEXWtdJByLped0px_S1r_H_r0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "skynews", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence \u2018afraid\u2019 of sexy scenes after nude photo hack", "text": "Jennifer Lawrence \u2018afraid\u2019 of sexy scenes after nude photo hack By -

We had 530 attendances here in Newham on Monday, our normal rate is about 430, so you can see that the numbers are going up. \nBut we saw 97% of people within four hours yesterday which is a terrific performance by this hospital, so we are coping. \n:: NHS in \u2018toughest ever financial situation\u2019, says outgoing trust boss \nWe\u2019ve now got a system wide plan which involves not just the hospitals in the area but also social services, community services, metal health and primary care. So we\u2019ve got one big system working together for patients. \nThe chief executive of NHS Providers, Chris Hopson, said: Our report highlights the range of measures trusts have put in place to improve resilience and provide safe, timely care for patients. \nBut we have to recognise we are not where we would want to be as we head into winter. \nThe NHS is already under severe pressure, and while the additional funding in the recent Budget is welcome, it has come very late to be used to maximum effect. \nThe warning comes as NHS England publishes its first winter pressure situation reports, figures that will reveal the volume of patients attending A&E departments across the country in the first few days of December. \nIn previous years they have also included the number of A&E departments under pressure, defined as those that have activated the two highest level of escalation plans. \nThe NHS uses four Operational Pressure Escalation Levels, known as OPEL 1-4, in response to extreme stress. \nOPEL 3 is declared when major pressure compromises patient flow, and OPEL 4 when pressure means hospitals cannot deliver comprehensive care, and there is the potential for patient care and safety to be compromised. \nSources have suggested those figures will be withheld this winter, but NHS England said it was unable to clarify what statistics will be included ahead of publication.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alistair chesser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris hopson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nhs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "a&e", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newham university hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "budget", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sky news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "opel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhs providers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhs england", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "newham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:53.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a3757d07e43958c9a1c63464418734e6d3b2d782", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS30E3iAHHnoSXdAZtnnaSZ9d0lq82xLCkkXMDF30tZIQFDemdiZUnwfZ1p2w7J2rs-", "site_full": "www.stereoboard.com", "site": "stereoboard.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/StereoboardcomNewsFeed", "site_categories": ["entertainment"], "section_title": "Stereoboard.com Music & Tour News", "title": "Blondie Share Video For Doom Or Destiny Featuring Joan Jett", "title_full": "Blondie Share Video For Doom Or Destiny Featuring Joan Jett", "published": "2017-12-07T09:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://static.stereoboard.com/images/artistimages/blondie.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 58569, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a3757d07e43958c9a1c63464418734e6d3b2d782", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS30E3iAHHnoSXdAZtnnaSZ9d0lq82xLCkkXMDF30tZIQFDemdiZUnwfZ1p2w7J2rs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "Blondie Share Video For Doom Or Destiny Featuring Joan Jett", "text": "Blondie Share Video For Doom Or Destiny Featuring Joan Jett Blondie Share Video For Doom Or Destiny Featuring Joan Jett   Written by Laura Johnson \nBlondie have shared a video for Doom or Destiny featuring Joan Jett. \nThe track is taken from their new album, \u2018Pollinator\u2019, which was released this spring and also boasts collaborations with TV on The Radio\u2019s Dave Sitek, Dev Hynes, Sia, Johnny Marr, Charli XCX and Strokes guitarist Nick Valensi.

If you see how Dom Solanke performed in Stoke, how Daniel Sturridge performed when he came on, he could have scored two or three, he made a goal for Sadio, that\u2019s good. \nPhilippe Coutinho led the way with his first Liverpool hat-trick with Sadio Mane scoring twice, while Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah also got on the scoresheet. \nIt meant Liverpool topped Group E and will avoid PSG, Barcelona and Roma but could still draw Bayern Munich, Juventus or Real Madrid. \nWe knew if we won we would top the group so that\u2019s not the biggest surprise but I think it\u2019s strange this year in the group stages, Klopp added. \nThere are a lot of really strong teams. This year is quite special.

It can be melted down to make things like electrical appliances, children\u2019s toys or even computers. \nHowever, China has announced that it will stop taking the UK\u2019s scrap from January and those in the industry are warning that the Government has no plan or infrastructure to deal with the situation. \nSimon Ellin, chief executive of the Recycling Association, told Sky News: We have been warning the Government for quite a long time that China will at some point say \u2018enough is enough. We don\u2019t want the world\u2019s garbage. We want to stimulate our own internal collection\u2019. We have seen it coming. \nIn 2016 the UK exported 790,000 tonnes of scrap plastic. Of that, 55% went to China or Hong Kong. \nThat meant that household plastics going to those countries accounted for a quarter of all the UK\u2019s recycling exports. \nElena Polisano, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: Instead of confronting our growing problem with throwaway plastic at home, we have been shipping it off to places like China where it\u2019s easier for us to ignore. \nNow that China has decided they\u2019ve had enough of our waste, it\u2019s obvious that the UK\u2019s recycling system simply can\u2019t cope with the mountain of plastic waste we generate. It\u2019s time to stop kicking the plastic bottle down the road and finally getting to grips with the problem at source. \nThe concern for many is where much of the UK\u2019s plastic recycling will end up if it is not being exported abroad. Some could be burned, but many fear scrap could make its way into our oceans, harming marine and bird life. \nPlastic pollution in the ocean has been the target of Sky\u2019s Ocean Rescue campaign. \nReducing single use plastic and making products easier to recycle could help combat the problem, but with China\u2019s announcement and no clear plan from the Government, there are growing concerns. \nWhen questioned about the issue last month, Environment Secretary Michael Gove said he hadn\u2019t given the subject much thought, which angered many industry experts. \nIn response, a Defra spokesperson said: We are continuing to work with the waste industry and the Environment Agency to understand the impact across the sector of the Chinese government\u2019s proposed restrictions on waste imports. \nWe are also looking at ways to process more of our recycling as part of our resources and waste strategy. \n:: Find out more about Sky\u2019s campaign to help save our seas, and get involved by visiting the Sky Ocean Rescue website where you can watch our documentary, A Plastic Tide.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon ellin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael gove", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elena polisano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ocean rescue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recycling association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenpeace uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environment agency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sky ocean rescue", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:53.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f46d6a6eadeb3ed1fbbf700dc54514ae3851114", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powGR6tzybr2NJMlGlAihy7ZURr0Fqfe0rBtY25NdyxB1SUfZ.fir7vSrdzYll1EhTcZ0m0s_d5tGJONJ0YtPhmCjwNREeYGK0pkBqNAeKqY6gr8gFk3L6nx", "site_full": "iwradio.co.uk", "site": "iwradio.co.uk", "site_section": "http://iwradio.co.uk/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Isle Of Wight Radio", "title": "Williamson backed in \u2018bare-knuckle fight\u2019 over defence spending", "title_full": "Williamson backed in \u2018bare-knuckle fight\u2019 over defence spending", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://iwradio.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/skynews-gavin-williamson-defence-secretary_4144988.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f46d6a6eadeb3ed1fbbf700dc54514ae3851114", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powGR6tzybr2NJMlGlAihy7ZURr0Fqfe0rBtY25NdyxB1SUfZ.fir7vSrdzYll1EhTcZ0m0s_d5tGJONJ0YtPhmCjwNREeYGK0pkBqNAeKqY6gr8gFk3L6nx", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "skynews", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Williamson backed in \u2018bare-knuckle fight\u2019 over defence spending", "text": "Williamson backed in \u2018bare-knuckle fight\u2019 over defence spending By - 7th December 2017 \nOne of the country\u2019s most senior politicians has called on the Defence Secretary to enter into a \"bare-knuckle fight\" with the Treasury to secure more money for the defence budget. \nDr Julian Lewis, chairman of the Defence Select Committee, has told Sky News that the time has come for a showdown and indicated he will support Gavin Williamson\u2019s efforts. \nResponding to the growing public rift between the Chancellor and the Defence Secretary, the experienced Conservative MP said that the country is now at a stage of crisis in defence funding and warned that money will not be won from the Treasury by asking nicely. \nYears after we took the peace dividend at the end of the Cold War we were still spending 3% of GDP on defence, he said. \nWe barely spend 2% now and that is utterly inadequate. Therefore if Gavin Williamson is prepared to have a bare-knuckle fight with the Treasury to get defence spending raised to the level it absolutely needs, and if he wins that fight, he will deserve our total support. \nOn Wednesday The Times newspaper claimed the RAF would stop flying the Chancellor until he has paid for past ministerial flights. Phillip Hammond is said to have been furious by the front page headline. \nIt was a cheap shot, childish and completely unhelpful, an ally of the Chancellor told Sky News. Why would Phillip want to help out Gavin after that? \nSome Tory MPs have started to express concerns that the deteriorating relationship between Mr Williamson and the Chancellor could have an effect on negotiations for more money. \nA meeting between the two ministers scheduled for Monday was cancelled at short notice \u2013 a new date has not been scheduled. \nMr Lewis\u2019s rallying call is made on the same day that the UK\u2019s new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth will be formally commissioned into the Royal Navy. \nLarge crowds are expected on the south coast to see the Queen who will be present for the ceremony in Portsmouth \u2013 the first time she will have visited the 65,000 tonne ship since naming her in 2014. \nThe significant moment will mark the transfer of ownership from the consortium who built her to the Navy who will sail and operate her. \nHMS Queen Elizabeth has just completed the second stage of her sea trials after sailing from a dockyard in Rosyth, Scotland last June. \nShe is the first of two new aircraft carriers, collectively costing more than \u00a36bn. The second, HMS Prince of Wales, will start her sea trials in 2019. \nThe trials have included systems testing, fire drills and inspections of hatches and doors. Flight trials will begin next year off the east coast of America using F35 stealth fighter jets and the ship will be ready for operational duties in 2021. \nIt has been a mixed week for the Defence Secretary \u2013 some senior Army officers were left bemused after the he posed for a photo shoot on Monday with two military dogs that were due to be put down. \nIt\u2019s all very well the Defence Secretary saving dogs but we would rather he put his efforts into saving our jobs, one Army source commented. \nIt has also emerged that Mr Williamson has held a series of meetings with Conservative MPs to brief them on the ongoing national security review \u2013 he reportedly told them that the defence budget is predicated on a lie and conceded he can\u2019t see a way out of the crisis. \nThe frank admission contradicts Mr Williamson\u2019s public optimism \u2013 he previously told The Sun newspaper he was quite good at delivering having never lost a single vote as chief whip, and last week he told the House of Commons that he\u2019s always seen the 2% (spending) as a base against a ceiling. \nConservative MPs are starting to up the ante as the National Security Review nears completion. \nMark Francois, a former defence minister, said: I think colleagues are now following the progress of this review very closely and would take a very real interest as it plays out and it\u2019s important to remember amidst all of this that the first duty of government is defence of the realm and I would expect the review to reflect that.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phillip hammond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elizabeth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavin williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julian lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark francois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phillip", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "house of commons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national security review", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sky news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defence select committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal navy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hms prince of wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosyth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portsmouth", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:53.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4967ad33ca39e642e5196d2996a17b137fde0d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTOhukGS.dXZ.Y7CUmNG2I61MO2vry5scZHjyu_mNgtClKzUsTwdMeJdlb.kEMKJ5RG3zRg_w7Kkd.T806FV8k2zUIURa3miUKXLjNlCErLE8xT92toA1dJtqjc1ZtR4.wFE5vIcGU9jA--", "site_full": "www.hdforums.com", "site": "hdforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.hdforums.com/forum/milwaukee-eight-m8-198/", "site_categories": ["vehicles", "mororcycles"], "section_title": "Milwaukee Eight (M8) - Harley Davidson Forums", "title": "who's been having to add transmission fluid? - Page 240", "title_full": "who's been having to add transmission fluid? - Page 240 - Harley Davidson Forums", "published": "2017-12-07T09:51:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.024, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 35948, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e4967ad33ca39e642e5196d2996a17b137fde0d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTOhukGS.dXZ.Y7CUmNG2I61MO2vry5scZHjyu_mNgtClKzUsTwdMeJdlb.kEMKJ5RG3zRg_w7Kkd.T806FV8k2zUIURa3miUKXLjNlCErLE8xT92toA1dJtqjc1ZtR4.wFE5vIcGU9jA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "lh4x4", "published": "2017-12-07T09:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "who's been having to add transmission fluid? - Page 240", "text": "Quote: : I was told today to come pick up my bike.

Cities such as London, Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Brussels and Copenhagen are re-designing existing roads and cutting vehicle speeds but say they cannot be successful \" if we do not also improve in parallel the safety of the cars, vans and trucks \". \nToday\u2019s urban trucks have deadly blind spots. Currently there are no rules in place governing the amount of the road truck drivers must be able to see. However, research clearly shows that trucks with low-entry cabs, which many European manufacturers already make, have excellent direct vision and prevent road fatalities. \nThe EU has the exclusive competence to mandate safety improvements for new cars, vans and trucks. The last new safety requirements date back to 2009 and the Commission continuously keeps postponing updating the rules. \nDr. Julius Menge of the Berlin's Senate Department for Urban Development and the Environment, said: \" We are implementing measures to boost road safety and enhance public health. But we need the EU to improve the design of vehicles to make them safer, especially trucks with deadly blind spots. That is why we urge the Commission to introduce a European direct vision standard for trucks most commonly used in urban areas, and ambitious direct vision requirements for other truck types. \" \nEarlier this year eight EU countries including Germany, Italy and France demanded new EU-wide standards for vehicle safety to cut road deaths. \nThe letter also calls for the legislative reform to boost the deployment of advanced emergency braking systems (AEBS) and intelligent speed adaptation (ISA). (1) \nJames Nix, freight and climate director at NGO Transport & Environment, said: \" London has taken the lead here by banning trucks with the worst visibility; Amsterdam, Berlin, Copenhagen and Dublin are among the many cities now examining a similar move. It\u2019s up to the Commission to avoid a patchwork of different direct vision standards across Europe. Manufacturers should not have to make six different trucks for six different direct vision standards. \" \nIn 2016, 25,500 Europeans died in traffic accidents, around 500 deaths per week. \nNotes to editors: \n(1) Regarding direct vision, a differentiated approach is recommended in the letter, i.e. the standard would first be applied to urban delivery trucks, with construction and long-haul vehicles subject to longer phase-in periods. Earlier this year Internal Market Commissioner El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska said that a \" differentiated approach may be justified for direct vision standards for trucks driven mostly on motorways, and for city delivery trucks more likely to affect pedestrians and cyclists \".
