Bloomberg", "text": "China\u2019s second-largest copper smelter said it began halting capacity last week at its main production hub in the city of Tongling after the local government ordered the curbs as part of a national plan to ease pollution over the winter months.\nTongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co., based in Anhui province, is idling 20 to 30 percent of its smelting capacity, from an annual total of 800,000 metric tons, Wang Guojian, vice commercial director, said by phone Thursday. There\u2019s no timetable for how long the cuts may last, he said.\nWhile other producing regions such as Shandong and Jiangxi aren\u2019t affected, if the environmental curbs spread it should support Chinese smelters in their annual negotiations over processing fees with overseas miners, Wang said. Those talks were suspended last week without resolution on what price miners will pay to get their copper refined in 2018. China is the biggest producer and consumer of refined copper and relies on some of the world\u2019s biggest miners for its raw material.\n\u201cIf the curbs are enacted in more regions, or nationwide, that will affect demand for copper concentrate,\u201d said Wang, adding that the company has yet to resume the negotiations.\nIntense Talks Tongling\u2019s willingness to halt capacity shows just how much pressure is generated by the negotiations, Ji Xianfei, an analyst with Guotai Junan Futures Ltd., said by phone from Shanghai, \u201cIt\u2019s also really hard to say how much, and how long the cuts will last,\u201d Ji said. \u201cThe battle is intense during the annual talks.\u201d\nEven before the deadlock, the negotiations were taking longer than in previous years, Ivan Arriagada, chief executive officer of Chilean miner Antofagasta Plc, said in an interview last week.\nWhile miners contend that ore is in short supply, which should spur a drop in fees, China\u2019s smelters say they are being forced to upgrade facilities to comply with environmental rules, and charges should reflect their higher costs.\nCopper rose as much 1.1 percent to $6,620 a ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at $6,569 by 12:37 p.m. in London. The metal closed at a three-year high of $7,134.50 in October, but has since retreated due to worries over slowing growth in China.\nAnhui province\u2019s government issued its order asking polluting industries such as steel, cement, and nonferrous metals to cut capacity by more than 30 percent this winter, a local newspaper reported last month.\n\u2014 With assistance by Winnie Zhu", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wang guojian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winnie zhu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ji xianfei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "natalie behring/bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivan arriagada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ji", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg news company", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "antofagasta plc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg terminal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tongling nonferrous metals group holdings co. ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guotai junan futures ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tongling nonferrous metals group co.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tongling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shanghai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jiangxi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anhui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shandong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anhui province", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:01.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9a364b36e0368c595c6d2ce1a273055811cc5877", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWrC4vBh884NZn0kVWc1nrwAGcPFnVtKCIn0sDj4iFl_vut7XWhh59NkYAED3t0acYgcSbJ9QhjuuHrA7HiOjfIVCao1e3TldQo18JdJaUSHI-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/shop-feeding-nursing-2/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Feeding - Buy Feeding at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "Dutch Lady Explore\u2122 2-4 Plain 900g", "title_full": "Dutch Lady Explore\u2122 2-4 Plain 900g | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2000-12-31T18:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 100, "participants_count": 83, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.102, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6d8c9b394b02d06ac24fdc281010b7897ac5333", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWrC4vBh884NZn0kVWc1nrwAGcPFnVtKCIn0sDj4iFl_vut7XWhh59NkYAED3t0acYgcSbJ9QhjuuHrA7HiOjfIVCao1e3TldQCo5zBUcXHywTItqKEaPWFw--", "ord_in_thread": 53, "author": "Marhanis", "published": "2017-11-21T10:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "Five Stars", "text": "fast delivery", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:01.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "99af7c347a0aff85e967a5a3962ff22732b71fd3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRrQMwA9kyMdN9O_g2GOU6.1UCNqrQD45CRbnW069mBCdzkojNZF0AUF019qljOqbkWqGT1QX22v6ZgGcZczazYFjXMgB6UR4JZsRLJKd_C766TZAPg_h9_L76O.EJitv8-", "site_full": "www.businessoffashion.com", "site": "businessoffashion.com", "site_section": "https://www.businessoffashion.com/syndication/feed", "site_categories": ["media", "fashion", "style_and_fashion"], "section_title": "The Business of Fashion", "title": "Chanel Breaks Free", "title_full": "Chanel Breaks Free", "published": "2017-12-07T11:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.businessoffashion.com/site/uploads/2017/12/473ed4a0ca2d40230a212b60e1696ae8-5a29045a7f79c.jpeg?crop=faces&amp;fit=crop&amp;ixlib=php-1.1.0&amp;max-h=300&amp;w=599", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 27922, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "99af7c347a0aff85e967a5a3962ff22732b71fd3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRrQMwA9kyMdN9O_g2GOU6.1UCNqrQD45CRbnW069mBCdzkojNZF0AUF019qljOqbkWqGT1QX22v6ZgGcZczazYFjXMgB6UR4JZsRLJKd_C766TZAPg_h9_L76O.EJitv8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tim Blanks", "published": "2017-12-07T11:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "Chanel Breaks Free", "text": "At Chanel, Sobriety and Sin In his birthplace of Hamburg, Karl Lagerfeld showed one of his best collections in recent memory.

In the twilight of his years, Karl Lagerfeld , fashion\u2019s \u00e9minence grise was coming home to show in his birthplace Hamburg. A final spectacle, an imperial peace made with his past. \nOK, I got that one wrong. The truth? Starchitect superstars Herzog De Meuron designed a new concert hall for Hamburg that ran untold millions of euros over-budget and flipped the burgermeisters\u2019 wigs. But the building has since become a cultural fulcrum so potent that it garnered Hamburg a cover of national newsmag Der Spiegel which labelled the city the new capital of Germany. Lagerfeld saw that cover, sat up and thought, \"Let\u2019s go back.\" \nSo here we are, in the Great Concert Hall of the Elbphilharmonie for the annual presentation of Chanel\u2019s Metiers d\u2019Art. An orchestra led by British wunderkind Oliver Coates (Radiohead\u2019s favourite stringmeister) is tuning up. An audience of some 1400 people arranges itself across a configuration of seating so precipitous that the genes of a mountain goat could prove useful in negotiating one\u2019s way ever upwards. Silence falls. The strains of La Paloma, the Marseillaise of a city which has, unlike any other German metropolis, never kneeled to a king, fill the auditorium. The models walk. Chanel breaks free. \nHamburg is a port, matching Rotterdam as the biggest in Europe, \u201cbut more fun\u201d, Lagerfeld claimed after his show. He opened with a whole lot of sailor stuff: chunky roll-necked cable-knits, pea coats, drop-front pants, duffel bags. His male models sucked on long-stemmed pipes. And everyone was wearing the same sailor caps that would be familiar to Beatles\u2019 fans, well-versed in the folklore of four lads whose three years of fierce, character-forming gigging in Germany turned them into a hit machine for the ages. Remember, John Lennon said, \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up in Liverpool, I grew up in Hamburg.\u201d \nThere was a refreshing strictness to the effect: minimal but powerful. It reflected Lagerfeld\u2019s sense of his hometown. \u201cHamburg was always kind of discreet,\u201d he observed, \u201cnever a red carpet city. They\u2019re humble people who never showed how rich they were.\u201d True, in that respect, Hamburg has more in common with its Scandinavian neighbours than the rest of Germany to the south, and all the better for it. \nThat restraint helped Lagerfeld to one of his best collections in recent memory. He insisted it was much too sentimental to claim the show as some kind of homecoming, telling the story of a distinctly unsentimental mother who, intuiting her son\u2019s inclinations, told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not born for the business world so you\u2019d better go somewhere else.\u201d The only real option was Paris. \nStill, Lagerfeld told a small huddle of journalists, \u201cIf you were not from Hamburg, it would be difficult to make this collection.\u201d Perhaps by that he meant the sober luxury of the clothes: the pinstriped suits with their sailor collars, the Stygian eveningwear discreetly shot through with silver beading, the muted colour palette of navy, grey and brick red, a melancholic reflecting of sea and sky and the city\u2019s solid architecture, incorporated by Herzog De Meuron into the Elbphilharmonie\u2019s interior. (There was also a colour-blocked pattern which apparently reflected the dockside stacks of containers which testify to Hamburg\u2019s importance as a port. The designer seemed very taken with them). \nBut there was something else in this collection that distinguished it from its predecessors. It was sexy. Those cashmere cable-knits were shown as abbreviated sweater dresses, with matching thigh-highs. There were sheer blouses and black leather, little strapless dresses with ruffles of jet coq feathers and a literal raciness in the stripes down the side of black crepe tuxedo pants. And that was Hamburg too, the port city whose Reeperbahn district became a global byword for bad behaviour. Sobriety sparked with sin, always a potent combination. \nAt the after-show party, in the Fischauktionshalle, a massive barn of a place that felt like a Viking hall, singing \u201csailors\u201d serenaded the heaving crowd with sea shanties. Sanitised though it was for the here and now, it wasn\u2019t hard to imagine the building\u2019s past, where the city\u2019s brawlers and nightcrawlers would famously show up for a fish breakfast after a night on the tiles.

Raeburn stretched the advantage of 20-7. \nOn the hour Peebles scored the best try of the afternoon. \nFrom a scrum on the Lodge 10 metres line the ball was passed to Donald Anderson, then Greg Raeburn before Callum Anderson managed to link with Scott Stoddart to go over. \nThe successful conversion made it 27-7. \nWith 15 minutes remaining on the clock Peebles earned the bonus point as Kenny Clyde drover over from close range. \nThere was still time for James King and Roddy Guiney to add to the try count in the final 10 minutes. \nRaeburn was on target with one of the conversions. \nThis was a good all-round performance from Peebles - all the more satisfying after a shaky opening 10 minutes. \nThis weekend Peebles begin the second half of their league campaign against Lasswade at The Gytes. \nPeebles are certainly playing better rugby than when the teams met in September, and hopes are high that the scoreline can be reversed. \nKick off at The Gytes is 3pm.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peebles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allan beveridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian walls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenny clyde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raeburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "willy brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan whittingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott stoddart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murray brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roddy guiney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "callum anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "preston lodge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg raeburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan stewart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lasswade", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "preston lodge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lodge", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:03.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4377323cc08ad85a9445bfa5c5fcf687e506f58f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Uco8Mgb0Fi4.9bv4zGbLtlKH1BQx3ktB_SMOtGG743CoXukp0r2FmpPgUy35T1fJZX2CrnkPDLcoq7ggalhX0i8ItBr9dMbYJP.bq0s1lFjSg--", "site_full": "dipuwibogo.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://dipuwibogo.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "dipuwibogo", "title": "Cortes s\u00f6r\u00f6s kupak / s\u00f6r\u00f6skupak 1 FT-R\u00d3L NM\u00c1!

Should I be worried?\n Honestly, I'm seeing red flags here. He doesn't seem to have emotionally moved on even if he wants to or thinks that he has. I'm not suggesting that you stop seeing him but I would slow things way down with him. You don't just want to be his rebound from his last relationship. You should continue to be fun... light/ happy when you are with him but don't put a lot emotionally into this relationship just now. October wasn't long ago really. If they were serious enough to discuss marriage he needed/still needs time to process the break up - that is normal. As I said be a fun date when you do go out but don't always be available or act too eager. Let him purse you a bit. Then in a few more months, say March(ish), if you are still seeing each other discuss his ex w/ him and if he has acted like a true boyfriend to you and says he wants to be your boyfriend then move forward but right now you are really just in a wait and see pattern. I'm guessing he thinks you're just casually dating right now and not in a full blow relationship so be patient but don't read too much into your time w/ him. IF things don't work out w/ him please know it wasn't you at all!! Life has a way of working itself out, taking time out to work on yourself will prove valuable.

This reduces battery capacity and lifespan and can even destroy the batteries. Scientists at the Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich and the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have now presented a process that, for the first time ever, allows this so-called lithium plating process to be investigated directly. This puts new strategies for quick-charging strategies close at hand. \nLithium plating, the depositing of metallic lithium at the anodes of lithium-ion batteries, is one of the primary factors that limits charging current. The performance of batteries suffers significantly from these metallic deposits. In extreme cases this can result in short circuits and even batteries going up in flames. \nWhen charging batteries, the positively charged lithium ions move through the liquid electrolytes and are deposited in the porous graphite anodes. However, the larger the current and the lower the temperature, the greater the probability that the lithium ions will not be deposited within the electrodes, as desired, but rather as a solid metallic layer on the outer surface. Indirect evidence does not serve the goal \nEven though this phenomenon is basically well-known, many aspects remain shrouded in mystery. Until now, it was not possible to directly observe how and under which circumstances lithium plating takes place. \"Using traditional methods of microscopy, we can only observe a battery after the fact, because it needs to be cut open,\" explains Dr. Josef Granwehr at the J\u00fclich Institute of Energy and Climate Research (IEK-9). \"In the process, further reactions that distort the results become inevitable.\" \nEven highly developed processes like neutron scattering allow for only indirect analyses. Compounding the problem is the fact that available slots for measurements at research reactors and large particle accelerators are scarce. This makes these tools more suitable for fundamental investigations than for tedious, practical test series. Electrons show the way \nThe electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy process presented in the renowned scientific journal Materials Today, on the other hand, can be readily integrated into laboratory procedures \u2013 with only moderate investment. The method is akin to the better-known nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, albeit focusses on electron spins rather than atomic nuclei. \n\"Electrons are placed in an externally applied, static magnetic field,\" explains Granwehr. Unpaired electrons in the sample are \"sounded out\" using microwaves. In the magnetic field, these stimulate the electrons to flip, which can be measured via the associated drop in microwave radiation intensity. EPR can differentiate between metallic lithium plating and lithium embedded in the graphite anodes. The test cell is the key \n\"The key to detecting lithium plating using EPR was the construction of a test cell compatible with the requirements of EPR spectroscopy while at the same time exhibiting good electrochemical properties,\" explains lead author Dr. Johannes Wandt. \"The geometry is also important. Precise measurement results are contingent on the sample being exposed to the magnetic field but not the inevitably present electric field.\" \nTo ensure this, Wandt developed a rod-shaped cell while he was a doctoral candidate in the group of Prof. Hubert A. Gasteiger (Chair of Technical Electrochemistry) at TUM that allows the formation of metallic lithium to be detected directly and with quantitative precision. The right strategy for quick charging \n\"Using this process, it is now for the first time possible to investigate lithium plating and the associated processes in a differentiated manner that is relevant to a whole array of applications,\" explains R\u00fcdiger-A. Eichel, a director at the J\u00fclich Institute of Energy and Climate Research (IEK-9). \"One example is the development of safe and at the same time fast charging protocols. Our process make determining the maximum charging current before lithium plating sets in possible, as well as ascertaining other boundary conditions like temperature and the influence of electrode geometry.\" \nBeyond this, the methodology is well suited as a test procedure for a variety of battery materials, for example the development of new admixtures that suppress lithium plating. \nOriginal publication:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "j. wandt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forschungszentrum j\u00fcl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wandt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eichel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josef granwehr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannes wandt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. granwehr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hubert a. gasteiger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "forschungszentrum j\u00fclich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "technical university of munich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j\u00fclich institute of energy and climate research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chair of technical electrochemistry", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:56:04.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d260eb9ad061bc965ce3279b6b59569494db2e32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSz3Z.hio98inFSa7lu40JrU-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Tic-Tac-Toe", "title_full": "Tic-Tac-Toe", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.778, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d260eb9ad061bc965ce3279b6b59569494db2e32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSz3Z.hio98inFSa7lu40JrU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:53:00.000+02:00", "title": "Tic-Tac-Toe", "text": "# Tic-Tac-Toe\r\n# Plays the game of tic-tac-toe against a human opponent\r\n   \r\n# global constants\r\nX = \"X\"\r\nO = \"O\"\r\nEMPTY = \" \"\r\nTIE = \"TIE\"\r\nNUM_SQUARES = 9\r\n\r\n\r\ndef display_instruct():\r\n    \"\"\"Display game instructions.\"\"\"  \r\n    print(\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Welcome to the greatest intellectual challenge of all time: Tic-Tac-Toe.  \r\n    This will be a showdown between your human brain and my silicon processor.  \r\n\r\n    You will make your move known by entering a number, 0 - 8.

Telling users to open this same page, but in safari is confusing, and they need to login again, and navigate to that page again.\nImagine if a website told you that if you had previously \"bookmarked\" their page in your desktop browser, that you had to remove the bookmark to use a feature. You'd be skeptical at the very least right? It's a strange request...\nNot to mention that even detecting it is kind of broken. The feature looks like it's available (opposed to pre ios 11 where the functions didn't exist), but when you go to use them they throw a generic exception (which can mean anything from they are in the \"added to homescreen\" browser on ios, the camera randomly crashed on android, another app is currently using the camera, or it just didn't work for some unknown reason).\nSo we have to check for the nonstandard `navigator.standalone` property, then just assume it won't work for the user.

In southern and central Somalia, localized areas received light to moderate rainfall of 1-25 millimeters (mm) (Figure 1), according to satellite-derived rainfall estimates by RFE. Rainfall totals ranged between slightly below average in far southern areas to slightly above average in central areas (Figure 2). Rainfall estimates for the same time period were similar according to preliminary Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS). Ground information also indicates light rainfall in central and southern areas, although no rainfall was reported by rain gauge stations in Hiiraan, Lower Shabelle, Middle Shabelle, and Middle Juba, contrary to remote-sensing products. In Lower Juba, no rainfall was reported by remote-sensing products; however, ground information reported moderate rainfall. \nSituation \nIn the Northwest , no rainfall was reported in all livelihood zones of Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed, Togdheer, Sool, and Sanaag between November 21 and 30. The exception to this was Guban Pastoral livelihood zone of Sanaag, in which isolated areas received light to moderate rainfall in late November. \nIn the Northeast , no rainfall was reported in Bari, making this the second consecutive ten-day period without rainfall. Similarly, little to no rainfall was reported in most livelihood zones of Nugaal and northern Mudug. However, moderate rainfall was reported in Hawd livelihood zone in Galkayo of Mudug. In all northeastern areas except Hawd Pastoral livelihood zone of Nugaal and Mudug, pasture and water availability is well below average. Livestock migration is taking place towards Hawd Pastoral livelihood zone from neighboring livelihood zones and from Lowland Hawd Pastoral livelihood zone of Ethiopia. \nIn central regions , light to moderate rainfall was reported in most areas of Galgaduud and isolated areas of southern Mudug between November 21 and 30. Light rainfall was received in Dhusamareeb, Adado, Abudwaq and southern Galkayo. In Hobyo District, though, rainfall was moderate to heavy. Rainfall in this district follows significant rainfall deficits experienced in early October. Overall, rainfall in central regions during the reporting period was average or slightly above average in most areas and encouraged the return of livestock that had previously migrated to Togdheer and Nugaal. \nIn the South , remote sensing products indicate light to moderate rainfall was received in many areas. This is somewhat consistent with ground information, though there are some notable differences. Field information reports moderate rainfall in most areas of Lower Juba, though satellite-derived rainfall estimates suggest little to no rainfall was received in this region. In Hiiraan, Lower Shabelle, Middle Shabelle, and Middle Juba, RFE indicates light rainfall was received, though rain gauge stations reported no rainfall during the reporting period. Ground information is consistent with remote-sensing products in Bay, Bakool, and Gedo, though, where rain gauge stations reported 12 mm of rainfall in Baidoa, 14.5 mm in Dinsor, 4 mm in Qansahdhere, 7 mm in Hudur, and 10 mm in Bardhere. In all areas that did receive rainfall, rains were poorly distributed across space and time. No river flooding was reported along the Juba and Shabelle Rivers during the reporting period. However, farmers in riverine areas of Lower and Middle Juba opened barrages during the reporting period and most riverine areas are now under cultivation. \nThe satellite-derived eMODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) indicates that vegetation conditions in southern, central, and localized northern areas have improved relative to the previous reporting period (November 11-20). However, significant deficits still exist in large areas of southern and central Somalia, including coastal areas and key crop-producing regions (Figure 3). According to Climate Prediction Center\u2019s seven-day rainfall forecast, no rainfall is forecast for all areas of the country through December 10 (Figure 4). \nFor more rain gauge data, please, contact or visit www.faoswalim.org .
