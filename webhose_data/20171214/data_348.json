After work, we\u2019ll get into comfortable shoes and randomly pick a route for the night. Sometimes we\u2019ll walk one way around the marina, sometimes the other, and then sometimes along the main street. The weather is incredible these days with just the right amount of chill, the most perfect breeze and a sweet quietness in the air. There are people everywhere, hanging out on benches, running, biking, eating at roadside restaurants, chatting as they walk by, yet it never feels loud, just a very calm buzz all around. \nI\u2019m a creature of intoxication with pointless plans, so each time we step out, we pick a tiny milestone for that day. Let\u2019s walk to the coffee shop and back, or let\u2019s walk to that restaurant, get a light dinner and head home. Maybe get to that bridge on the far end of the marina and see all the eating places along the way. One night we walked along the main road all the way to our favorite chai place, stopping at signals, over pedestrian crossings and ended up discovering neighborhood shops we\u2019d never seen before. It\u2019s interesting how the same thing looks entirely different when you experience it from a different perspective. \nWe pretty much download our entire day on each other as soon as meet after work so while walking our conversations are more luxurious. Random goals, life plans, silly discussions. It\u2019s things you don\u2019t really find the time for or remember to talk about when at home because something\u2019s always there to occupy your attention. Then at times, it\u2019s also really nice to walk together in silence and just spend time in your own head. Reconcile your thoughts or maybe just stay blank. It\u2019s incredible how your best dates with a partner or even yourself are often the ones that cost you nothing at all. Talk, no talk, enjoy the night lights, rate restaurants as we walk past them, people watch, feel grateful for our lives, all the good stuff that comes for free. \nIt\u2019s a routine yet with no structure and just a simple reminder that it\u2019s always the small things that\u2019ll bring you joy the most.

Opener \u2018Son of Solomon\u2019 is seductive, comparing love to wine and seeking light in the darkness of the soul. It\u2019s all crooned in sweet vocals that are layered with gentle acoustics and a wonderful violin composition.\n\u2018Bulletproof Love\u2019 also features beautiful acoustics, which then give way to an upbeat and playful rhythm in the chorus. However, among all the fairytale vibes of love and light, there is also loss and pain injected into Jupiter Calling . The emotional depth is creatively projected through harmonic melodies, but it\u2019s still beating with an intensity of its own. \u2018No Go Baby\u2019 really plucks at the heartstrings; the lyricism is striking and reverberates with heartache and grief. \u2018The Sun and the Moon\u2019 is emotional in its exploration of loss, ending the album with a mystical yet candid ambience.\n8/10 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "solomon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrea corr", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "corrs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jupiter calling", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:35.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b62e4c4953934fd881b697ba9ded90aa469c2f1a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSlUw2L_XJ4vCGY.Zt7Gwu0tT23RQvyUUsOe.RjP4rZLDGXwyz1xWGqYyewEDHNYmIkGLgaHLI67zlOFZcHl4HEJ67xxAMYJSnqsMTlXslXS8GjMbC4K1vC2sZVT3GmpSgDI1jEx4_R1g--", "site_full": "travelhelpguru.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://travelhelpguru.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "25%* off lebua at State Tower, Bangkok (Promo Code Not Needed) \u2013 Travel Help Guru", "title": "25%* off lebua at State Tower, Bangkok (Promo Code Not Needed)", "title_full": "25%* off lebua at State Tower, Bangkok (Promo Code Not Needed)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b62e4c4953934fd881b697ba9ded90aa469c2f1a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSlUw2L_XJ4vCGY.Zt7Gwu0tT23RQvyUUsOe.RjP4rZLDGXwyz1xWGqYyewEDHNYmIkGLgaHLI67zlOFZcHl4HEJ67xxAMYJSnqsMTlXslXS8GjMbC4K1vC2sZVT3GmpSgDI1jEx4_R1g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "travelhelpguru", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "25%* off lebua at State Tower, Bangkok (Promo Code Not Needed)", "text": "25%* off lebua at State Tower, Bangkok (Promo Code Not Needed) can be found on: https://www.travelhelpguru.com \n\nGet Discount \nPromo code & hotel info Hotel name: lebua at State Tower, Bangkok\nAddress: State Tower 1055/111 Silom Road, Bangrak, Bang Rak, 10500 Bangkok, Thailand\nCity: Bangkok\nCountry: Thailand\nDescription: Located in Bangkok, 1.4 miles from Chinatown, Sampeng, lebua at State Tower features air-conditioned rooms and free private parking.\nSave money: *Get up to 25% off your stay depending on the days of the week you book your room, the duration of your stay, the current availability of the room, the season of the year, and other factors\nPromotion code details: No coupon or promotion codes are currently required to save money (any available discount will be automatically applied)\nProperty description (rooms, rates, deals & more) One of our top picks in Bangkok.\nLocated in Bangkok, 1.4 miles from Chinatown, Sampeng, lebua at State Tower features air-conditioned rooms and free private parking.

Focus Areas Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities Refugees, newly arrived migrants and culturally and linguistically diverse communities Communities/groups experiencing socio-economic disadvantage Programmes providing access, equity and inclusion opportunities to Education and Training and creating Pathways to Sustainable Employment. Build numeracy and literacy skills for pre-school, primary school and secondary school students Build numeracy and literacy skills for adolescents and adults Building STEM capabilities for pre-school, primary school and secondary school students Supporting student wellbeing and fostering school engagement Scholarship, Internship or Bursary Programmes Building interpersonal, employability and life skills for adolescents and adults (personal grooming, interview skills, and other workplace skills) Mentoring and Coaching Access to vocational training opportunities for adolescents and adults Building learning skills through art or music programmes Programmes providing access to entrepreneurial and business foundations Community health To assist organisations that conduct programmes with the express purpose of improving the physical health, nutrition, and well-being of the Australian community. Programmes promoting participation in physical activity and sport Programmes promoting improved nutritional intake Principles and/or Criteria Innovation and proactivity: The foundation seeks to support programmes that respond to an identified area of need in the community that are presently not being addressed, or that take a new approach to problem solving. Ideally, such programmes, if successful, should be able to be replicated in other locations or contexts. Change not charity : A focus on prevention is one of foundation\u2019s main criteria. The foundation endeavors to fund projects that address the causes of problems, rather than treat the symptoms. Longevity and sustainability \u2013 foundation supports projects and programmes that will continue to have an impact over the long term and beyond period of support. The foundation also encourages programmes that are able to become financially self-sustaining. Project-based and goal-orientated : The programmes that we choose to fund must have strong and identifiable outcomes and key performance indicators over both the short and long term. Partnerships : To maximize the impact of foundation\u2019s grants , they look towards organizations that are able to combine funding with other sources. The ability to leverage financial support from other trusts, foundations, governments, businesses and volunteers is seen as important criteria. Administration \u2013 They look to make grants to organisations that have low administration costs and solid and proven administrative backing. Organisations with a strong volunteer programme are also highly regarded. Bennelong Foundation involvement \u2013 They try to support organisations that have the capacity to allow their staff to become involved in their organisation/projects, should they choose.
