December 7, 2017, 2:41   \nS mall-scale farmers in Wayanad have found a way to ensure a sustainable income and end the exploitation they face in the hands of middlemen. \nThey are now preparing to launch an organic green tea factory, under the Wayanad Green Tea Producer Company, which is a collective of 147 small-scale tea growers, reports The Hindu . The factory will produce and market affordable speciality tea. \nThe Tea Board of India has in the past tried to make small-scale tea growers form collectives such as producer-societies or self-help groups (SHG) for sustainable green tea leaf trade, Jose Sebastian, the chief executive officer of NABARD, told the publication. However, most of the SHGs have to depend on bought-leaf factories in the absence of any processing facilities. Picture for representation only. Source: Flickr \nMembers of the Small Tea Growers Society at Karadippara and the Karshaka Jyothi Small Tea Growers Society at Vattachola in the district received support from NABARD five years ago. They constituted the farmer-producer company to overcome the exploitation in the sector. \nLater they opened the green tea-exclusive factory at the cost of \u20b983 lakh. NABARD provided \u20b945.80 lakh as assistance the State Industries Department provided a start-up grant of \u20b93 lakh. \n\u201cNow the farmers are getting only \u20b911.50 a kg of green leaf.

Honestly, even pop music itself was unsure how to answer that question. \nThe 2016 Presidential Election lead to a hyper-polarized climate where everything was politics whether one liked it or not. Some people suggested that the coronation of Donald Trump would lead to some \u201cgreat\u201d protest music, but that astoundingly narrow-minded view negated the fact that such supposed art would come at the cost of people lost losing rights to travel and be in the military and seek sanctuary when it\u2019s truly needed. While courts blocked some of those orders, their effects nonetheless affected an untold number of lives, leading to mass protests unlike any political movement in recent memory. No one was stopped from trying to articulate the populist rage on either side of the political spectrum through their art, but if we\u2019re being honest here, no one has been able to pull it off successfully so far. \nFor evidence of this, look no further than staunch Hillary Clinton supporter Katy Perry. She finally unleashed her new album\n\n\nWitness\n\n\n, which was lead by the vaporwave-indebted politically-minded single \u201cChained to the Rhythm\u201d, and after unleashing a continuous succession of chart-topping singles, having the lead track from her new album stall at Number Four on the Billboard charts showed that Perry was whittling down her audience to the core, and the album\u2019s two followup singles didn\u2019t even break the Top 40. \nMeanwhile, Miley Cyrus did a turn for country music as a move\n\nto appease and court Trump supporters\n\nand show the world it was a better place (that album flopped, for the record). Conversely, planet-swallowing publicity machine Taylor Swift tried parlaying her recent dramas into confrontational dance music, but she instead got caught up in countless political narratives, from those\n\ncondemning her for not condemning Trump\n\nto those claiming\n\nher music had become a rallying cry for American neo-Nazis everywhere\n\n. Even as recently as 2015, these kind of questions would never have entered the thoughtspace of any given pop idol. \nSo what is pop music in 2017? For some, it\u2019s pure escapism: a way to escape the desperate headlines that dominate our everyday. For others, it\u2019s standing up for causes that matter, which is why Logic broke through with his song \u201c1-800-273-8255\u201d, a heartbreaking plea to not take your own life which lead to The National Suicide Prevention Hotline (whose number is the title of the song)\n\nto reach historic levels of call volume\n\n. For others, it wasn\u2019t even escapism: there was music out that that just made you want to forget all of this heaviness and just dance your cares away. \nNo matter where your politics line up, at least we can all still rally together and celebrate some of the best pop releases of the year, whether it be a fiery new album from Betty Who, a long-anticipated new album from Haim, a surprisingly-sturdy debut release from former boy band frontman Harry Styles, the most accessible release to date from Portugal\u2019s favorite pop-rock export The Gift to nothing of the countless unearthed and unheard of re-releases we\u2019ve seen this year. There was an uncovered album from Dion, a re-issued classic from Paul Collins Beat, and king above them all was Prince, whose super-deluxe reissue of\n\nPurple Rain\n\npulled out all the stops and gave us enough unheard and oft-bootlegged tracks to qualify itself as the greatest Prince album never released. \nSo sit back, relax (for once), and enjoy the most joyous and surprising pop releases we\u2019ve had the pleasure of spending time with during this monumental year. \n\n\n15. House of Feelings \u2013\n\nLast Chance\n\nEP (Infinite Best)\n\nFrom its clattering saxophone wails to its emotional and joyous Shamir cameo, Matty Fasano positively announced himself to the world with the debut release under the guise House of Feelings, a dancey little ball of fire that covers a lot of genres in its scant eight songs. At times it feels like the best basement rave you\u2019ve ever been to, at times it sounds like a bedroom pop stoner-party masterpiece, but no matter how you splice it, it\u2019s a damn fun, often weird little album, with distorted voices asking if you remember how we met on Twitter. In many ways, there\u2019s no rhyme or reason to the House of Feelings aesthetic, but therein lies the appeal: even in a short EP\u2019s length, you will find yourself giddy with all of HoF\u2019s possibilities. \nhttp://ift.tt/2AZ8q56 \n\n\n14. Dune Rats \u2013\n\nThe Kids Will Know It\u2019s Bullshit\n\n(Dine Alone)\nDanny Beausa and BC Michaels make this look easy: the hooks are immediate, the attitude is bratty, and this Brisbane punk-pop grab-bag can sometimes get away with lyrics where they suddenly, outside of rhyme scheme, just say \u201cblah blah blah\u201d. It may sound casual or even tossed-off, but that\u2019s the point: for the second Dune Rats full length, the group sing about free love and a guy who owes them money to score LSD, but it\u2019s all presented with such intensity and sense of purpose that it\u2019s hard not to want to join in on their sweaty, drug-fueled party. \u201cScott Green\u201d will go down as an all-time indie-punk classic, but that song anchors an album of unrelenting energy, their lyrics filled with disaffection that\u2019s been curbed with clouds of weed smoke. It\u2019s trashy. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s addictive. So go on: give in. This is peer pressure that you can handle, wimp. \n\n\n\n\n13. Jessie Ware \u2013\n\nGlasshouse\n\n(Interscope)\nJessie Ware\u2019s debut album came out five years ago, but it already feels like she\u2019s been a member of the pop music firmament for so much longer, as her beguiling voice has given and shape and form to songs that feel truly timeless, beaming in the light of the new even as it feels like they\u2019ve been around for decades. With Glasshouse, Ware has stripped things down considerably, going for songs with bare instrumentation, which in turn forces her voice and lyrics to be the center of the show. It\u2019s a gambit that pays off in stellar fashion, as lead single \u201cMidnight\u201d sounds like a modern-day soul standard, albeit on her own terms. Ware continues to take risks at every turn: \u201cFirst Time\u201d is built off a choir of her own multi-tracked vocals, while \u201cStay Awake, Wait for Me\u201d has the lightest touches of country classicism painted over its sparse verses. With all these distinct detours, Glasshouse may not have been the Jessie Ware album we were expecting, but it points to all the directions her stylish and sophisticated pop sonic will be going. We\u2019re just lucky to be along for the ride. \n\n\n\n\n12. Miami Horror \u2013\n\nThe Shapes\n\nEP (self-released)\nIs it weird to think of an EP as the greatest distillation of an artist\u2019s essence? It doesn\u2019t happen very often (some would still point to TV on the Radio\u2019s opening salvo as their finest offering), but for Australia\u2019s finest \u201980s-pop aficionados \u2014 already two full-length albums into their career \u2014 they really gave this short, concise six-song EP everything they got. As an opening salvo, \u201cSign of The Times\u201d uses Miami Horror\u2019s group vocals to a stunningly emotional effect, while \u201cTrapeze\u201d feels like the best ripoff of the beat to Talking Heads\u2019 \u201cOnce in a Lifetime\u201d we\u2019ve ever heard. \u201cAzimba\u201d (a knock of \u201cI Zimbra\u201d perhaps?) realizes its African-indebted polyrhythms can lead to some good-ol\u2019-fashioned rump-shakin\u2019, and all of this, in a scant 23 minutes, results in one of the best dance parties you\u2019re likely to have all year. The great thing about an EP this short? Once it\u2019s over, you\u2019re left wanting more, which just means you\u2019ll have to put it on again. \n\n\n\n\n11. LANY-\n\nLANY\n\n(Interscope)\n\nThis full-length has been a long time coming, as the trio that is LANY (short for Los Angeles New York) have been dropping EPs full of millennial sweet-talk since 2014. Their last offering, 2016\u2019s\n\nkinda\n\n, showed them finally honing in on the spoke-sung smooth blog-pop sound that would become the core of their musical identity, and their eponymous debut album carries on in that vein perfectly. Every chorus is punctuated with a too-catchy-for-its-own-good keyboard riff that only serves to drive the group\u2019s overly romantic (and sometimes borderline creepy) lyrics home. It\u2019s a daring little album, full of heartbreaks and breakbeats, obsessions and confessions. Keep an eye on their fans this whole time, because those who fall in love with it don\u2019t just like it: they become fixated with it \u2014 and for good reason. \n\n\n\n10. Mack Keane \u2013\n\n2107\n\nEP (MasonMack)\nOne listen to \u201cI Would\u201d, the stunning horn-centric slice of soul that sits at the heart of NYC-bred Mack Keane\u2019s\n\n2107\n\nEP, and it\u2019s obvious that beyond some obvious blue-eyed soul comparisons, Keane means what he sings, continuing on Jamie Lidell\u2019s electronic/R&B hybrid experiments to its logical conclusion. From the midnight bedroom sleekness of \u201cUnconventional\u201d to the stuttering \u201cBenny and the Jets\u201d-aping piano bounce of \u201cModel Behavior\u201d, Keane establishes his pop credentials firmly on this seven-track sampler of his skills, seemingly stuck between genres but never once sounding out of place. He masters any style of song thrown his way without succumbing to mere chamelonisms, his vibrant warble finding its place within the songs but never showboating just for the sake of it. No matter which way you slice it, this is an absolutely thrilling debut. \n\n\n\n\n9. !!! \u2014\n\nShake the Shudder\n\n(Warp)\nLet\u2019s pour one out for !!!, shall we? It seems that no matter how brilliant and propulsive their shuddering brand of dance-rock gets, people just kind of expect this level of quality from Nic Offer at this point, almost to the point of dismissal. It\u2019s a real shame too, because\n\nShake the Shudder\n\nmarks yet another high watermark for the band, mixing hard grooves with weird lyrics and this time out featuring some of the group\u2019s synthiest excursions yet. \u201cThe One 2\u201d tussles with drum-and-bass for the first time ever, but the humorous lounge groove of \u201cImaginary Interviews\u201d shows that no matter how (or how little) press !!! receives these days, Offer isn\u2019t without a great sense of humor. Joke\u2019s on us though: !!! are just going to keep getting better whether we give them the time of day or not. Would write more about this album but can\u2019t: too busy dancing. \n\n\n\n\n8. Amelia Airhorn \u2013\n\nAmelia Airhorn\n\n(self-released)\n\nRelease for free due to the sheer number of samples used here that would be too expensive to license, this glorious mixtape matches up the sleek dance music kings The Knocks with the creator of\n\nPopMatters\u2019 2015 Best Pop Album\n\nSkylar Spence, and the melding of minds results in a project that doesn\u2019t even try to hide how much it sounds like The Avalanches, which is just \u2014 great. Songs are built out of scraps and pieces, meaning you hear a bit of a pitch-shifted Jay-Z verse here, the\n\nFriends\n\nTV theme song there, a crazy drum break underscoring all of that. The two \u201cStreet Performers\u201d are custom-made for getting crazy on the dance floor and \u201cNY Is Red Hot\u201d grinds and boogies with horns blaring out the lead melody lines, but it\u2019s that solo pop single that is \u201cMiracle\u201d that truly captivates, the first new lick of Skylar Spence music we\u2019ve heard in some time. It\u2019s a barn-stormer of a banger, rife with sampled disco strings, Daft Punk-aping synth work underneath, and a feeling of euphoria that washes over you before the song even ends. The whole album may have been conceived as a one-off goof of a collaboration, but these songs will stick with us for years to come. \n\n\n\n\n7. Lorde \u2013\n\nMelodrama\n\n(Lava)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know what we were expecting for Lorde\u2019s second full-length, \u2018cos as dominating and intriguing as her sparse-beats-meets-hyperspecific-lyrics mindset was, her debut album came out when she was only 16 years old. Impressive as it was, a lot can change during your teenage years, so when she took four years until the release of\n\nMelodrama\n\n, we didn\u2019t know certain things, like how she had snuck off to make the album with go-to pop music producer Jack Antonoff, whose piano-based pop leanings seemed like a natural fit for everyone\u2019s favorite New Zealand diva. The end result was still surprising though, as her songs were more fully musically realized, more fleshed out. Her lyrics, however, were as cutting as ever, and songs like \u201cHomemade Dynamite\u201d and \u201cSupercut\u201d showed off her biting view towards romance, later dropping casual swears in the midst of otherwise soundtrack-ready songs like \u201cPerfect Places\u201d because why not? Lorde\u2019s been offered a lot of freedom in a very short amount of time, and she\u2019s using every inch of it to lay out a very specific vision \u2014 we\u2019re all just lucky to bear witness. \n\n\n\n\n6. St. Vincent \u2013\n\nMASSEDUCTION\n\n(Loma Vista)\n\nSt. Vincent wasn\u2019t in need of saving: she switched to the major label system for 2014\u2019s self-titled effort, and it turned into her highest-charting record yet despite the fact that it was arguably her weirdest record to date.. Yet the St. Vincent we get on\n\nMASSEDUCTION\n\ncan\u2019t turn off what turns it on, and even with some Jack Antonoff pop overtones, it somehow manages to out-weird even its predecessor, layering the guitar parts and over-elaborate production to the point where it feels like the album is an alien machine that spits out nothing but sex jams for robots that can feel. Yet as lusty and lovely as the whole affair is, Annie Clark still found time to write her most concise and unadorned pop songs to date, leaving \u201cNew York\u201d as a true blue classic that sits outside of her eccentricities yet is born from them regardless. It\u2019s a stunning work from one of indie rock\u2019s most daring artists, a pop record that\u2019s recognizable in structure but gloriously foreign in the details that could only come from St. Vincent and no one else. \n\n\n\n5. Dan Auerbach \u2013\n\nWaiting on a Song\n\n(Nonesuch)\nAfter the bedroom-acoustic effort that was Dan Auerbach\u2019s first solo album outside of The Black Keys, few would\u2019ve guessed that for a followup, our bearded hero would go full ELO? Yet summoning the spirit of Jeff Lynne was exactly what\n\nWaiting on a Song\n\nset out to do, lead single \u201cShine on Me\u201d brilliantly playing like a track that should\u2019ve been on\n\nTraveling Wilburys, Vol. 2\n\n. Elsewhere, the strings and horns that ride along during \u201cMalibu Man\u201d drench the surrounding song in a lovely hue of \u201970s AM gold, leaving the rest of the album perfectly fit for Starlord, Groot, and the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy to sing along to. There\u2019s imitation and then there\u2019s inhabiting the spirit of your idols, and\n\nWaiting on a Song\n\npulls off the latter category in spectacular fashion. \n\n\n\n\n4. Niteshifters \u2013 Hard Disco (Delimusic)\n\n\nPeople refer to modern record as disco-inspired all the time, but few really capture the essence, the opulence that made disco the movement that it was. For the London-based Niteshifters, they\u2019re absolutely tuned in to every horn stab, soaring string section, high-hat gallop, and diva histrionics that make disco what it is. For their sensational, shimmy-inducing debut, the band re-creates the Studio 54 sound without even a trace of irony, vocal cuts melding with instrumental takes and live band workouts boogieing next to keyboard driven affairs in equal measure. You can\u2019t achieve this level of kitsch without having a deep-seated love of the material you\u2019re trying to work with, and\n\nHard Disco\n\nas big a mirrorball love letter as ever existed. \n\n\n\n\n3. White Sea \u2013 Tropical Odds (Crepuscule)\nAlthough she was a songwriting force on some of M83\u2019s most heralded albums, Morgan Kibby truly broke out into her own under the guise of White Sea with her 2014 debut\n\nIn Cold Blood\n\n. The hooks were immediate and the lyrics weren\u2019t afraid to walk through walls and gut your fish. Initially conceived a series of singles before Kibby finally relented and put it out as an album,\n\nTropical Odds\n\nis a moodier flipside of White Sea\u2019s mid-tempo sound, her stoned thoughts putting a gloriously overcast sky on her lyrics, her music, and her whole aesthetic. She confronts her fears regarding intimacy, the meaningless of life, and so much more \u2014 but all of it is wrapped in memorable hooks, ascending synth lines, and her perfectly curated vocal takes that let the emotion breathe through without once overpowering the songs in question. It\u2019s an underappreciated gem that may very well articulate your own gloomy year perfectly. Pour yourself a glass of red wine: Morgan\u2019s here for you. \n\n\n2. Jens Lekman \u2013 Life Will See You Now (Secretly Canadian)\nIt\u2019s not that\nI Know What Love Isn\u2019t, the 2012 release from everyone\u2019s favorite Swedish pop jester Jens Lekman, was a letdown so much as it was an acknowledgment that even with all of the genre jumping that Lekman puts all his quirky songs against, sometimes it\u2019s nice to sit back with a tight band and not worry about turning a new musical trick with every track. Life Will See You Now, his first new full-length in five years, dismisses Isn\u2019t\u2019s thesis entirely by positively exploding with color, his confidence beaming even more than before. Whether it be the breakdown in his spectacular single \u201cWhat\u2019s That Perfume That You Wear?\u201d or the quiet mandolin plucking on the sweet \u201cHow Can I Tell Him\u201d or the sweet minimalist tell-off from his 2015 singles project \u201cPostcard #17\u201d, there is no shortage of joys or surprises to be found on one of the most diverse and stunning pop events this side of Shugo Tokomaru record. \nhttp://ift.tt/2AEhZUM \n\n\n1. Kesha \u2013 Rainbow (RCA)\nFollowing the too-public, drawn-out, heartbreaking legal battles that Kesha had with her former producer \u2014 and the record contract clauses that prevented her from releasing any new music under her own terms \u2014 the eventual comeback of a singer who shot to fame with ludicrously crunk numbers like \u201cTik Tok\u201d could\u2019ve taken most any form, and as the emotional, Ryan Lewis-produced single \u201cPraying\u201d showed us,\n\nRainbow\n\ncould\u2019ve easily been a mournful, empowering record about overcoming some of life\u2019s most rendering challenges. \nWhat a true shock it was to instead find that\n\nRainbow\n\ncontained a variety of moods as kaleidoscopic as its title, moving from celebratory to reflective to downright goofy, each song feeling like it belonged on a greatest hits compilation. There was no fiercer declaration of independence this year than the on the horn-driven \u201cWoman\u201d, no charging punk-pop hybrid as relentlessly nonsensical as \u201cBoogie Feet\u201d, and no off-the-cuff acoustic number as sly and sweet as \u201cGodzilla\u201d. No other record in 2017 managed to balance pathos with pure fun as deftly and effortlessly as\n\nRainbow,\n\nand by the time Dolly Parton shows up to cover an old standard of hers \u2014 which Kesha\u2019s mom wrote back in the late \u201970s \u2014 there is a sense of unity and warmth contained on that recording track that cannot be replicated with a budget ten times the size. One can\u2019t dismiss the narrative of redemption that lead Kesha to this moment, but\n\nRainbow\n\ndoesn\u2019t shy away from it either: it embraces it, plays with it, and turns it into what is unquestionably the best pop album of the year. \n\nfrom PopMatters http://ift.tt/2j1zj1m ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "taylor swift", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shamir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miley cyrus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lany-  lany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "betty who", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan lewis-produced", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prince", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lorde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan auerbach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainbow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "annie clark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lekman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daft punk-aping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry styles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dolly parton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katy perry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vincent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kesha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff lynne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mack keane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jessie ware", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danny beausa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kibby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matty fasano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie lidell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul collins beat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ware", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jens lekman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack antonoff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shugo tokomaru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgan kibby", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "warp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of feelings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interscope", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skylar spence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national suicide prevention hotline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami horror", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. vincent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loma vista", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portugal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:36.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "41169478feb55b58eb1d85d2a8806c1857076f3c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9OkMgiM8Cuf8Io0f0PREr1LFzjTJeExPmaT1HSi8qFUb0AXDFCDa7AoPmR_SQq2DoENLHGDTVuMPT0SD1QBdOElcV5ssbbUB.gE776DovDEw--", "site_full": "www.civicx.com", "site": "civicx.com", "site_section": "http://www.civicx.com/forums/civic-versus.8/", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Civic versus... | 2016+ Honda Civic Forum (10th Gen) - Type R Forum, Si Forum - CivicX.com", "title": "Civic hb touring vs Elantra got sport vs gti", "title_full": "Civic hb touring vs Elantra got sport vs gti | 2016+ Honda Civic Forum (10th Gen) - Type R Forum, Si Forum - CivicX.com", "published": "2017-11-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.65, "main_image": "http://www.civicx.com/styles/brivium/stylium/potassium/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 95455, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a8cadd3cf3085d4a4afe92d107445e19e898506c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9OkMgiM8Cuf8Io0f0PREr1LFzjTJeExPmaT1HSi8qFUb0AXDFCDa7AoPmR_SQq2DoENLHGDTVuMPT0SD1QBdOElcV5ssbbUB9f6az15jP6y.bTPH8ZHKzC", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "IDriveACivic", "published": "2017-11-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "If I have your budget, I'd get the GTI.

Defeating neurotoxicity with a repurposed drug PPAR\u03b4 is a permissive nuclear receptor that heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to activate target genes. Interference with transcription of PPAR \u03b4 target genes contributes to neurodegeneration in Huntington\u2019s disease (HD). In new work, Dickey et al . evaluated the RXR agonist bexarotene in cellular models of HD and in an HD mouse model. They determined that bexarotene was effective at countering HD neurotoxicity in mouse primary neurons, human HD patient stem cell\u2013derived neurons, and the BAC-HD mouse model. The authors then examined the basis for PPAR\u03b4\u2019s neuroprotective effect and found that treatment with RXR/PPAR\u03b4 agonists enhanced oxidative metabolism, promoted mitochondrial quality control, and boosted protein homeostasis by activating autophagy. Abstract Neurons must maintain protein and mitochondrial quality control for optimal function, an energetically expensive process. The peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that promote mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. We recently determined that transcriptional dysregulation of PPAR\u03b4 contributes to Huntington\u2019s disease (HD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from a CAG-polyglutamine repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. We documented that the PPAR\u03b4 agonist KD3010 is an effective therapy for HD in a mouse model. PPAR\u03b4 forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), and RXR agonists are capable of promoting PPAR\u03b4 activation. One compound with potent RXR agonist activity is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved drug bexarotene. We tested the therapeutic potential of bexarotene in HD and found that bexarotene was neuroprotective in cellular models of HD, including medium spiny-like neurons generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with HD. To evaluate bexarotene as a treatment for HD, we treated the N171-82Q mouse model with the drug and found that bexarotene improved motor function, reduced neurodegeneration, and increased survival. To determine the basis for PPAR\u03b4 neuroprotection, we evaluated metabolic function and noted markedly impaired oxidative metabolism in HD neurons, which was rescued by bexarotene or KD3010. We examined mitochondrial and protein quality control in cellular models of HD and observed that treatment with a PPAR\u03b4 agonist promoted cellular quality control. By boosting cellular activities that are dysfunctional in HD, PPAR\u03b4 activation may have therapeutic applications in HD and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases.

Firstly it reflects an election pledge made by US President Donald Trump to right-wing groups to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Contrary to the claims by many political commentators that Trump\u2019s pre-election promises were merely rhetorical, Trump has followed through on a number of his most controversial pledges since coming to power.\nIt reflects the fact that Trump is uninterested in forging a political consensus at home; given the intense polarisation of Americans, Trump understands he has little hope in winning over his detractors and is concentrating on shoring up his popularity among his core supporters.\nFor now, Trump appears to be immune to the widespread criticism his decision has provoked, even from Israel\u2019s friends and sympathisers, so long as he wins plaudits from his supporters, especially some of his financial backers, a narrow but vocal constituency.\nSecondly, Trump is seeking to divert attention from revelations that his top advisors allegedly colluded with Russia to influence the US elections last November. The announcement over Jerusalem offers a convenient distraction, and explains why this particle campaign pledge has been announced so suddenly at this point in time even though it appears Washington has put in none of the diplomatic or logistical ground work necessary for such a major decision. The fact that Washington has had to enact such a major break from seventy years of US protocol as a source of distraction demonstrates just how vulnerable this administration has become in less than a year in power.\nWhile domestic factors have motivated this decision, the reverberations will be felt on the international front, not least for the US.\nThe status of the Holy City - whether all or parts of it should fall under Israeli or Palestinian or even international jurisdiction - has been one of the most intractable issues in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, so much so that the matter has always been postponed for \u2018later stages\u2019 in any negotiation process between the parties and has thus never been directly addressed.\nWashington\u2019s announcement therefore fundamentally undermines its role as a peace-broker in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, reflecting a broader pattern of withdrawal from its traditional role as a conflict mediator.\nThe decision from the Trump administration will of course have the gravest consequences for Israelis and Palestinians. It emboldens the hardline and extremist factions on both sides who oppose any kind of settlement and see the dispute as a zero-sum conflict.\nIdeological and political extremism need enabling events to feed their claims and to mobilise their constituents - Trump\u2019s decision is one of those enabling events. Israeli settlers who contravene international law by settling in the occupied Palestinian territories, including the annexed East Jerusalem, will see this as carte blanche to continue with an illegal and incendiary settlement programme. Meanwhile Palestinian groups who criticised the Oslo Accords, calling it a \u2018surrender\u2019 rather than a peace process, will argue that Washington\u2019s latest decision proves there is no point to diplomacy or compromise.\nTensions and conflict in Jerusalem have already been inflamed in recent years; this decision is likely to provoke increased protests and clashes in the city.\nLest these clashes are portrayed as a \u2018Jewish-Muslim\u2019 problem, it should be highlighted that Christian Palestinian leaders have also condemned Trump\u2019s announcement, as have some left-wing Jewish and Israeli groups in both the US and Israel.\nIt should also be noted that this decision from the United States is less of a watershed than at first seems, simply because the normalisation of the occupation of East Jerusalem has been gathering apace for years. Over 300,000 Palestinians living in Jerusalem are already subjected to heavy restrictions on movement and employment, and house demolitions on numerous legal technicalities are frequent.\nOnly a fraction of the municipal budget is allocated to the Palestinian population in the city, while in July this year the Israeli government approved of another Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem containing 1,800 units.\nSuch policies are already well established, and while they are validated by Trump\u2019s decision they are hardly dependent upon it. Moreover, the implications of this move not likely to lead to a major fall-out between the United States and leaders of Arab countries.\nWhile some condemnation or discomfort has been expressed from traditional allies such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan, they are unlikely to jeopardise their commercial and diplomatic ties over this announcement from the United States.\nAs is often the case, it is the local population, both Israeli and Palestinian, that is likely to suffer the consequences of external politicking.\nDr Gani is a lecturer at the School of International Relations and Associate Director Centre for Syrian Studies at the University of St Andrews", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gani", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump administration", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "school of international relations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of st andrews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oslo accords", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holy city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:37.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "738c1c083d8c412a6c692674c9c64ef99ff7f47c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq_wA6rFCX_.9pS6BZxZSyX5GZMeYwgLaYpfHTTgdH1tOF1fC_sbOI7SufAboa2uBA-", "site_full": "stm.sciencemag.org", "site": "sciencemag.org", "site_section": "http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml", "site_categories": ["science"], "section_title": "Science Translational Medicine current issue", "title": "[Research Articles] A reversible thermoresponsive sealant for temporary closure of ocular trauma", "title_full": "[Research Articles] A reversible thermoresponsive sealant for temporary closure of ocular trauma", "published": "2017-12-06T20:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4580, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6, "comments": 0, "shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "738c1c083d8c412a6c692674c9c64ef99ff7f47c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq_wA6rFCX_.9pS6BZxZSyX5GZMeYwgLaYpfHTTgdH1tOF1fC_sbOI7SufAboa2uBA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bayat, N., Zhang, Y., Falabella, P., Menefee, R., Whalen, J.

A sealant to save sight Traumatic eye injuries require rapid treatment to prevent deterioration of vision. As an alternative to suturing or adhesives, Bayat and colleagues developed a temperature-responsive synthetic hydrogel that acts as a temporary sealant. Testing the hydrogel in a model of open globe injury in rabbits showed that the sealant was easily deployed from a custom-designed temperature-controlled syringe device and preserved intraocular pressure without evidence of chronic inflammation or toxicity. After gelation, the sealant could be removed by exposure to cold water. In combat or low-resource settings, this hydrogel could close wounds temporarily to prevent further tissue damage or vision loss before surgery. Abstract Open globe injuries are full-thickness injuries sustained to the eye wall (cornea or sclera), which cause immediate drops in intraocular pressure that may lead to retinal detachment and permanent vision loss if not treated rapidly after injury. The current standard of care for open globe injuries consists of suturing the margins closed, but the technique can be time-consuming, requires specialized training and equipment, and can lead to patient discomfort, abrasion, and infection from eye rubbing. We engineered an injectable, thermoresponsive sealant (TRS) and a custom tool to occlude open globe injuries. The smart hydrogel sealant consists of physically cross-linked N -isopropylacrylamide copolymerized with butylacrylate. At low temperatures, it can be injected as a liquid, and when raised to body temperature, a heat-induced gelation converts the hydrogel into a solidified occlusion. The sealant can be repositioned or removed without causing additional trauma via exposure to cold water. In vitro and ex vivo assessments of mechanical adhesion to eye tissue revealed maintenance of intraocular pressure that is five times greater than the physiological range with reversible seal strength comparable to cyanoacrylate (super glue). In vivo assessment in a rabbit model of ocular trauma demonstrated ease of use for TRS deployment, statistically significant improvement in wound sealing, and no evidence of neurotoxicity, retinal tissue degradation, or significant chronic inflammatory response after 30 days of exposure. Given the advantages of body heat\u2013induced gelation, rapid reversible occlusion, and in vivo safety and efficacy, shape-adaptable TRSs have translational potential as smart wound sealants for temporary occlusion of surgical incisions or traumatic injuries.

With no money for treatment, the young mother of two stares death in the face. \n\u201cI feel very bad,\u201d the 25-year-old tells AFP on the sidelines of a UN pollution conference, shivering in a thick jacket in the warm Kenyan sun. \n\u201cI have constant headaches. I cannot walk long distances, I can\u2019t even cook for my own children.\u201d \nOdinga is one of dozens of inhabitants of the Owino Uhuru slum near Mombasa, Kenya\u2019s second-largest city, who say they were poisoned by a plant recycling lead-acid batteries, the type used in cars. \n\u201cMy father, my brother, my husband all worked at the smelter,\u201d Odinga says. \u201cI washed their (work) clothes.\u201d She suspects this is how the lead got in her system. \nAddressing the scourge of lead pollution, a health hazard particularly in poor and middle-income countries, was a focus of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) held in the Kenyan capital Nairobi this week. \nOn Wednesday, environment ministers adopted a resolution expressing concern about the health and environmental impacts of lead-acid battery recycling. \n\u201cExposure to lead, including lead in paint and in waste lead-acid batteries, can cause serious lifelong damage, especially in children, such as loss of IQ and behavioural problems,\u201d it said. Everything changed \n\u201cExposure of pregnant women to high levels of lead can cause miscarriage, stillbirth as well as malformations,\u201d the resolution noted. \nLead exposure is estimated to cause nearly half a million deaths each year, according to the World Health Organization. \nIt accounts for more than one in ten cases of intellectual disability, 2.5 percent of global heart disease, and about the same percentage of strokes. \nPhyllis Omido worked at the Owino Uhuru battery recycling plant about seven years ago. \nA single mother with no daycare options, she brought her infant son, still breastfeeding, to work with her. \nAfter about two months, the boy, Kingdavid Jeremiah Indiatsi, fell ill. \n\u201cMy son had been a very easy baby from birth, he would sleep the whole night. My neighbours would always tease me: \u2018Are you sure you\u2019ve got a baby?\u2019 because he was always very silent. \n\u201cBut then suddenly he was screaming the whole night\u2026 He had fevers that were not breaking. Then he started (having) diarrhoea. Suddenly he was not able to eat. After some time he got very dehydrated. He was severely anaemic.\u201d \nAfter months in and out of hospital, and tests for diseases such as malaria and typhoid, Kingdavid tested positive for lead poisoning. \nThe diagnosis launched Omido into a years-long campaign to get the government, which licenced the plant, and company bosses to close the smelter and clean up the environment. \nThe plant was finally shuttered in 2014 \u2014 too late for many in the community of some 3,000 people. \u2018Just breaks my heart\u2019 \nMore than 150 community members and 22 smelter workers have tested positive for lead poisoning so far, Omido told AFP at the UNEA, which she attended as a delegate. \nDozens have died, many of them babies. \nWithout access to chelation therapy, which removes heavy metals from the body, King David\u2019s lead levels were reduced through years of treatment with calcium and zinc, thought to displace lead in blood, his mother said. \nBut the boy\u2019s future is uncertain. \n\u201cThe doctors advised me that he has to go for an (IQ) evaluation because lead affects the IQ. \n\u201cI\u2019ve not taken him for that because it just breaks my heart and I fear that if we tell him: \u2018This thing has affected your IQ\u2019 he might see himself like he\u2019s less than other children.\u201d \nKingdavid struggles with concentration, said Omido, who founded the Center for Justice Governance and Environmental Action as part of her campaign, and has been awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize. \n\u201cHe has many friends, and you can see a clear difference. He doesn\u2019t react as fast as other kids and\u2026 he can\u2019t concentrate on you for a very long time. \n\u201cWe have to do a lot of extra tuition for him. When his friends are on holiday, he still has to catch up.\u201d \nThe UNEA resolution adopted on Wednesday expressed \u201cstrong determination\u201d to reduce exposure to lead, \u201cincluding through promoting environmentally sound management of waste lead-acid batteries and eliminating lead paint.\u201d \nOmido also worries for her friend, Odinga, whom she brought to the assembly to highlight her plight. \n\u201cI\u2019m very surprised and thankful to God that Irene is still alive,\u201d Omido said. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid that if we do not act\u2026 she\u2019s going to die as well.

I got a sneak peak of a few of the recipes from this new book before it was published because I did some recipe testing for Aimee. I think I loved testing recipes from The Simple Bites Kitchen even more than for her first book Brown Eggs and Jam Jars (remember that iced cider caramel corn ? You guys. SO GOOD!). \nThis time around, Aimee sent me a small stack of recipes for me to bake my way through. I got to try the homemade empanadas (even the dough was made from scratch and it works well!). You can find them on page 83\u201384 of the book. And then there were the lemon cornmeal madeleines, which had a lovely flavour and texture (page 92). \nI roasted peaches (because I don\u2019t have a bbq) and then I made whole wheat shortcakes that I assembled into peach shortcakes with honey whipped cream (page 137). \nAnd though I enjoyed every recipe I tested from The Simple Bites Kitchen, there were two recipes that stood out. The first was the Honey Whole Wheat Bagel recipe (page 39). I keep telling people if there\u2019s one reason they should buy this book, it\u2019s for the bagel recipe, which I made over and over again after I was done testing the recipe because I enjoyed making bagels with the help of Aimee\u2019s recipe so much. It was fun. It was easy. Aimee\u2019s bagel dough is a dream to work with, and I adored playing around with all the different toppings I could sprinkle on my homemade bagels before baking (hello, za\u2019atar bagels!). \nThe second recipe, which I made a few extra times were these spiced stollen swirl buns. I love making loaves of stollen from this stollen recipe every Christmas to enjoy toasted with lots of salted butter. I\u2019d never thought to turn the dough into swirly buns. Genius! And the bonus is that you can make them ahead and bake them Christmas morning. \nBuy The Simple Bites Kitchen for the bagel recipe (trust me!), and stay for Aimee\u2019s take on the classic stollen recipe with these spiced stollen swirl buns (page 37). Aimee will also teach you life essentials like how to organize your fridge, which most of us could use a little help with (or is it just me?). The recipes in The Simple Bites Kitchen are approachable, but a little more sophisticated with a few twists on flavour that make things extra exciting. \nGet your copy of The Simple Bites Kitchen on Amazon . It would make a great gift! And you can also snatch up a copy of Brown Eggs and Jam Jars if you haven\u2019t already, over on Amazon too!

Suspended departmental head Dr Barney Selebano said he was afraid to stand up to former health MEC Qedani Mahlangu despite knowing the project would have adverse consequences. Selebano was under cross-examination by Section27 advocate Adila Hassim. He was testifying at the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearing in Johannesburg. \nSelebano is the latest senior official to admit that he was afraid to stand up to Mahlangu after project manager Levy Mosenogi also testified that despite presenting alternative plans to terminating the Life Esidimeni contract, he was dismissed by Mahlangu who asked him if he worked for the department or Life Esidimeni. He said he even asked for an extension because six months was not sufficient to move patients safely to suitable NGOs. Mosenogi also testified that despite raising numerous objections, he was undermined and the project was rushed through. Selebano came under fire for not investigating all the NGOs. He said that while he closed about five NGOs, he could not investigate the rest as the ombudsman was already investigating the deaths. Justice Dikgang Moseneke asked Selebano why the project did not have a monitoring system.\u201cThis was not a project to move bricks from one place to another. Why did you not have a tracking system?\u201d Moseneke said. \u201cWe all agree that this was a bad project. You can\u2019t defend it. There is no one with a conscience that can defend it,\u201d Selebano said. \nHassim asked Selebano why he licensed Precious Angels, to which he responded that he regularised it as it was decided that Manamela should no longer sign licences. \u201cWhy would you regularise a licence for Precious Angels which you had to close down yourself?\u201d Hassim asked. Precious Angels is one of the NGOs where patients died and that Selebano shut down after he was reportedly instructed to do so by the health minister. Selebano\u2019s last-minute attempt to avoid testifying at the Life Esidimeni Arbitration hearing on Monday wasunsuccessful. His lawyer Owen Cook made a submission arguing that his client should not be made to testify as the state had already conceded liability. Cook further argued that Selebano should be led by state lawyer Tebogo Hutamo as he was the one who subpoenaed him.

Servants Association (PSA) says it will continue with court action against Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, who it says has failed to respond to its demands. \nThe PSA will continue in its bid to secure control over public servants\u2019 pension investments. \nIn a statement, the PSA said it had repeatedly requested that Gigaba engage with labour about the management of public servants\u2019 pensions invested at the Public Investments Corporation (PIC) through the Government Employees\u2019 Pension Fund (GEPF). \nGigaba\u2019s failure to respond to letters from the PSA compelled the association\u2019s attorneys to hand over a letter of compliance to him on 27 November. \nIn the letters, the PSA requested that the minister amend the memorandum of incorporation to include GEPF representation on the board and to fill three available vacancies with labour representatives. \nThe PSA also demanded that 80% of the PIC board comprise of public servants and called for the removal of current board members who have conflicting interests. \nThe association called for the full disclosure of non-listed companies that have already been granted funding by the PIC and that new investments of this nature be frozen. \nAfter three months, the PSA finally received a response from Gigaba pointing out that a meeting would scheduled during the third week of January 2018, with labour. \nThe PSA statement said issues raised by the association had not been addressed in the response received by the minister. \n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the PSA has to continue with legal action to enforce compliance by the minister in a matter that is already governed by legislation,\u201d PSA Deputy General Manager Tahir Maepa said. \nThe PSA is determined to ensure that public servants are protected that PIC management is not forced into questionable deals. \nThe PSA will thus continue its court case. \n-TNA Reporter ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

murder convict December 7, 2017 0 5 \nThe National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is deciding whether to recharge a convicted murderer after he was released by the Constitutional Court. \nIn a majority judgment written by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, the Constitutional Court ordered the immediate release of Klaas Lesetja Phakane from prison after it found that the absence of key witness evidence against him was key to the accused successfully appealing his conviction and sentence. \nPhakane has been in jail since 2006 after he was convicted for the murder of his girlfriend Matilda Chuence Boshomane. \nHe was sentenced to 20 years for the crime. \nBoshomane\u2019s decomposed body was found in a veld. She was last seen on 19 or 20 August 2006, following an apparent argument with Phakane. \nThe cause of her death could not be determined due to the level of the decomposition of her body. \nThe North Gauteng High Court judgment said that another woman, who was also Phakane\u2019s girlfriend at the time, Martha Manamela, gave the police a statement in which she said Phakane had visited her on 20 August. She made her statement on 2 September 2006. \nManamela told the police Phakane had told her he had a fight with Boshomane and that he assaulted her with a waist belt. \nShe said Phakane admitted to leaving Boshomane in a veld, adding that he told her he had returned to Boshomane\u2019s home the following day but that she was not there. He also told her Boshomane was not in the veld, where he had left her, either. \nPhakane was arrested and subsequently charged with assault and murder, where he pleaded not guilty to both charges. \nThe state\u2019s case against him was largely based on circumstantial evidence and his alleged confession to Manamela. \nHe was then convicted and sentenced to 20 years in a largely circumstantial case. \nHis appeal against his sentence and conviction was dismissed by the North Gauteng High Court after it found that the absence of a key witness\u2019s evidence and transcripts was not detrimental to him successfully appealing his case. \nThe full bench found that the absence of Manamela\u2019s transcript was not such that the court could not fairly determine the appeal. \nPhakane then turned to the Constitutional Court seeking to overturn the decision. \nHis lawyer told the court that the absence of such key evidence meant that Phakane\u2019s appeal could not be determined fairly. He argued that this was an infringement of his right to a fair appeal, therefore his conviction and sentence should be set aside. \nIn a majority judgment, the Constitutional Court said Manamela\u2019s evidence in court was critical to his conviction by the trial court and, without the transcript of that evidence, the appeal could not be fair. \nTherefore, he should be released from prison immediately. \nThe judgment said that, while there was no longer sufficient evidence to convict Phakane of murder, there was still evidence from Phakane\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony that implicated him, leaving the possibility of the NPA to recharge him. \n-TNA Reporter ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "boshomane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manamela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raymond zondo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "klaas lesetja phakane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phakane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martha manamela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matilda chuence boshomane", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "concourt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north gauteng high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "constitutional court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "npa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "manamela", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:11:40.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d94a0f1cc973ee525726994c1335b4bb2624c714", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTcaEpr0Q7xVsXplHboW_5hpmMtZRRFkcGihuVeoinApTGMtLcw4fSPUAdfgknT4fLFSy3K0F_X75p_ZPn83TlnnQJu2Cub3mBowT6uPP3vAtgjzjHDBGShFzd0McCbok4qsLU3p3PWEIvd3vZT2nUreg--", "site_full": "www.heraldscotland.com", "site": "heraldscotland.com", "site_section": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/", "site_categories": ["media", "climbing", "sports"], "section_title": "Herald Scotland", "title": "Capital motorists to plug into electric vehicle charging hubs in three different zones", "title_full": "Capital motorists to plug into electric vehicle charging hubs in three different zones | HeraldScotland", "published": "2017-12-07T02:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.102, "main_image": "http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7150947/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31684, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d94a0f1cc973ee525726994c1335b4bb2624c714", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.fKmqfQ3WsnSW8DgGqloTcaEpr0Q7xVsXplHboW_5hpmMtZRRFkcGihuVeoinApTGMtLcw4fSPUAdfgknT4fLFSy3K0F_X75p_ZPn83TlnnQJu2Cub3mBowT6uPP3vAtgjzjHDBGShFzd0McCbok4qsLU3p3PWEIvd3vZT2nUreg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "heraldscotland.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Capital motorists to plug into electric vehicle charging hubs in three different zones", "text": "AN INNOVATIVE approach to electric vehicle charging hubs, offering different services in different zones, is being planned for Edinburgh .

In late 2016 we saw the introduction of the Golden Spike, which offered Altra\u2019s Zero Drop platform and ultra-wide toe box on an aggressive cross country spike. Then, in 2017, we saw the release of the Escalante and King MT, which provided both road and trail runners with highly responsive performance options, able take on anything from tempo runs to daily training. But even with several lightweight shoes on the market, Altra has yet to release a true road racing flat. This will change in early 2018 with the release of the 4.5-ounce Vanish-R. Now the lightest shoe in Altra\u2019s lineup, the Vanish-R provides runners with a stripped down racing flat that should excel in 5k to 10k races. With very few racing flats on the market falling under 5 ounces, the Vanish-R delivers a unique design that will surely appeal to the competitive road racer. \nMidsole \nTo create a responsive ride with minimal weight, this shoe features a thin EVA midsole that works with a firm-yet-flexible Propel Plate. With the extremely low-to-the-ground design, the Propel Plate should help provide a little extra pop while also limiting a \u201cbottoming out\u201d effect. Additionally, the Inner Flex design should offer plenty of flexibility and bend naturally through the gait cycle. \nUpper \nFor an ultra-lightweight design than maintains Altra\u2019s classic fit, the Vanish-R utilizes a near seamless mesh upper. The material is paper thin and breathable while offering a sock-like wrap with plenty of midfoot lockdown. A wider toe box allows runners to splay their toes naturally and gives runners with a wider-than-average forefoot the chance to actually fit into a pair of racing flats. \nOutsole \nOn the outsole we see mostly exposed EVA, to keep weight as low as possible, with strategic rubber placements for added durability. \n  14 mm heel, 14 mm forefoot, 0   4.5 oz (men\u2019s size 9) \n  Altra   Saucony Endorphin Racer 2 :   Nike Zoom Streak LT 3: Unisex Shoes Shop the Mizuno Wave Ekiden 11: Unisex Shoes Altra Vanish-R Unisex Sample (subject to change) Altra Vanish-R Unisex Sample (subject to change) \nConnor , aka The Face of Running Warehouse, is our resident footwear guru and helps us keep a finger on the pulse of running trends and current events.
