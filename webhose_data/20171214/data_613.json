\nSAN ANTONIO \u2014 It was quite an offensive performance for the rolling San Antonio Spurs. \nAnd coach Gregg Popovich pointed out, it also was just one game. \nLaMarcus Aldridge scored 18 points and San Antonio recorded 30 assists in a 117-105 victory over the Miami Heat on Wednesday night. \n\u201cThat\u2019s always wonderful,\u201d Popovich said of the balanced attack for the Spurs. \u201cAnd then when you sit down and when you start feeling good about it, you realize that Golden State does that every night. Ok, we\u2019ve got a ways to go, don\u2019t get too excited, but it is great to see.\u201d \nThe Warriors are tied with the Houston Rockets for the Western Conference\u2019s best record, but the Spurs are only 2 1/2 games back despite the season-long absence of All-Star forward Kawhi Leonard. \nWith Leonard\u2019s return looming from a right quadriceps injury, Aldridge led the Spurs in scoring for the 20th time in 25 games. \nWhile Aldridge has been the team\u2019s primary offensive threat in place of Leonard, San Antonio has carved out a 17-8 record by taking advantage of its depth. \n\u201cIt comes from everybody being willing to make a pass for us to be successful,\u201d said veteran Rudy Gay, who signed with the Spurs in the offseason. \u201cWe have to find the open man and pass up a good shot for a great shot. We\u2019ve been doing that well these past few games. I think that\u2019s one of the great things about this system, everybody is playing for each other and it ends up in the win column. That\u2019s part of the reason I came here.\u201d \nThe Spurs shot 52.9 percent from the field and had seven players score in double figures. Bryn Forbes had 17 points, and Gay finished with 16 in San Antonio\u2019s sixth win in seven games. \nTyler Johnson led Miami with 25 points, and Dion Waiters had 22. \nSan Antonio got off to a slow start defensively, just like it did in its comeback victory against Detroit on Monday night. Miami shot 58 percent in the first half, including going 9 for 18 on 3-pointers. \n\u201cIt was a little bit surprising that we were able to score 35 in the first quarter,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cWe moved the ball, knocked down some open 3s, that always helps, and then they started to get the game a little bit more to their liking.\u201d \nSan Antonio forced 11 turnovers and outscored Miami 60-47 in the second half. \nThe Spurs\u2019 reserves stepped up again, just as they have done all season. Forbes made three 3s in the third quarter, helping San Antonio to an 86-82 lead heading into the final period after they trailed by four at halftime. \nTIP-INS \nHeat: Starting center Hassan Whiteside missed his fourth straight game with a bruised left knee bone. \u2026 Spoelstra has 451 career victories, three shy of tying Pat Riley for the most in franchise history. \u2026 The Heat have not beaten the Spurs since Jan. 26, 2014, in Miami. Miami is 18-42 all-time against San Antonio in the regular season. \nSpurs: Forbes made a career-high five 3-pointers. He became the fourth undrafted player to make at least five 3-pointers in a game for the Spurs, joining Bruce Bowen, Gary Neal and Jaren Jackson. \u2026 The Spurs have made a 3-pointer in 1,000 straight games dating to April 9, 2005, the fourth-longest streak in league history. Dallas holds the record with 1,108 straight games with a 3 from 1999-2012. \u2026 Aldridge has 197 blocks, passing Tiago Splitter for 23rd in franchise history. \nUP NEXT \nHeat: Play Brooklyn on Saturday night in Mexico City in their first game played outside the United States or Canada in franchise history. \nSpurs: Host Boston on Friday night in the finale of a three-game homestand. \nON-THE-JOB TRAINING \nGay is still getting acclimated to the Spurs\u2019 offense, which has led Popovich to simplify his play-calling when the 12-year veteran is on the court. \n\u201cHe\u2019s just playing basketball,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cEvery once in a while he knows the play, but we stayed in just basically a little bit of motion for a lot of the game when he was out there so he can just play basketball. Because he\u2019s a good player, he doesn\u2019t need me to coach him on how to score, he does that well.\u201d \nGay is leaning on his teammates to make sure he is in the right place on the court as he grows accustomed to San Antonio after leaving Sacramento as a free agent. \n\u201cIt\u2019s great. I\u2019m asking questions all game and I guess it\u2019s forcing me to talk so I can\u2019t be wrong,\u201d Gay said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good place to be in. They just have to be on their Ps and Qs, because if they\u2019re wrong, I\u2019m telling Pop.\u201d \nFEELING FINE \nGinobili had 10 points in 25 minutes. He left briefly after bumping knees with a defender, but returned shortly after going to the back. \n\u201cOne of those that hurt right there in the moment,\u201d Ginobili said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt tonight and tomorrow a little bit, but it\u2019s nothing serious so, it should be OK tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow.\u201d TAGS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

work in ridding of illegal structures in the capital is maintained and assured that they would not allow people to rehabit the demolished areas again.\n\nSome of the affected occupants of the

\n\nSo. Dinner tonight is a new recipe - \"Unintentional Lasagne\" \nFirst time I've made it, and most likely the last as well, \nI HAD planned on stuffing cannelloni with spinach & ricotta, so I got set up for that.  \nThe canelloni had no cooking instructions, so I went online and found a supposed chef who said \"boil 8 to 10 minutes until Al Dente.  \nI looked at what he took out of the pot and Al Dente was not what I saw, so I decided to try six minutes.  \nShould have been four. \nSo, here I am with a spinach & ricotta mix, ready to stuff into cannelloni with all the spine of a snail, or a Republican congressman. \nAfter a vain attempt to stuff the first (and a few foul words, sigh)I had a brainstorm, complete with thunder, ouch. I cut the cannelloni lengthwise and it looked suspiciously like lasagna noodles (leaving me to wonder if the first lasagna was an accident as well) \nI'd already poured some roasted garlic pasta sauce into the baking dish to act as a base for the now-spineless pasta, so I laid out the now cut cannelloni over that, with a layer of ricotta & spinach and proceeded from there. \nAt the top layer, however, I ran out. Of ricotta, sauce, and patience. \nSo, I added the remainder of a jar of Herdez medium salsa, some extra sharp cheddar and about 1/2 pouch of 4 cheese Mexican blend. \nIt's all in the oven now, and I'm about to go look. . . \nNot nearly done. \nSo now it is a race between my appetite for unintentional Lasagne and my appetite for cheap port wine. \nSo far, the wine is winning, but it did, after all, have a big headstart, as I was sipping it the whole time I was mismanaging my dinner cooking chores. \nWarning! My pride tells me - \"ReRead this and check for spelling, typos, etc.\" My port wine tells me, \"Just POST the damn thing\" \nI am posting ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "al dente", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "herdez", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:59.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5ea2070486e0338160c77681505c9f35cfdd32ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCskm_gl44z3dUWwsHwOXTAfFo12LUQPt8Ersw.NBrCs9wr6QnpumKVdDHyYGkMS_dy3Pi5a3UdZZz6Hhu3gpfigG8YcpaLZAwsJuGVbBfk2MHs2HYGtAga7fXIUy5wXZPNbYwNA6untSpSY2swEpzXZKWyoU4zcU3IxhMf1LgX_fbhBXm4DLT", "site_full": "www.dealighted.com", "site": "dealighted.com", "site_section": "https://www.dealighted.com/dealighted_rss.xml", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping"], "section_title": "Dealighted.com Top User Posted Deals", "title": "Neato Robotics - Botvac Connected App-Controlled Self-Charging Robot Vacuum - Black $399.99", "title_full": "Neato Robotics - Botvac Connected App-Controlled Self-Charging Robot Vacuum - Black $399.99", "published": "2017-12-07T15:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 68695, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5ea2070486e0338160c77681505c9f35cfdd32ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCskm_gl44z3dUWwsHwOXTAfFo12LUQPt8Ersw.NBrCs9wr6QnpumKVdDHyYGkMS_dy3Pi5a3UdZZz6Hhu3gpfigG8YcpaLZAwsJuGVbBfk2MHs2HYGtAga7fXIUy5wXZPNbYwNA6untSpSY2swEpzXZKWyoU4zcU3IxhMf1LgX_fbhBXm4DLT", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T15:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "Neato Robotics - Botvac Connected App-Controlled Self-Charging Robot Vacuum - Black $399.99", "text": "More Deals & Coupons Like \"Neato Robotics - Botvac Connected App-Controlled Self-Charging Robot Vacuum - Black 9.99\" \n27 Nov, 1:41 pm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "neato robotics", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:59.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ba2bd3f9938e4e5c6b674d2d402bdd0524468c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdTDsNnoCo4J6wz60vpKlrPOj0amBEjRe6cqgtvMv6KUjiCQITEOhZMCKVFA_dsWPTYrPQ6Lq9WcbDJ6cfTKSLYE0r3op13BpZMLc356r.rQ--", "site_full": "theconservativekitchentable.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://theconservativekitchentable.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Conservative Kitchen Table", "title": "The Incidental Gourmet", "title_full": "The Incidental Gourmet", "published": "2017-12-07T09:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1fbfe949edac598652323fc97cccddff8229db66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrdTDsNnoCo4J6wz60vpKlrPOj0amBEjRe6cqgtvMv6KUjiCQITEOhZMCKVFA_dsWPTYrPQ6Lq9WcbDJ6cfTKSLYE0r3op13Bq6BQsjElqLmNmE5XrxkXf1", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Fay", "published": "2017-12-07T09:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Yum.

Eric Bledsoe added 22 points. \n\u201cWe just stayed with it,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cWe did a great job of holding onto the lead. We have just been grinding it out and staying with it.\u201d \nMilwaukee took a 60-51 lead into halftime, but Detroit outscored the Bucks 25-16 in the third quarter to send the game to the fourth tied at 76. \nThe Bucks took a 90-77 lead on a jumper by Malcolm Brogdon with 6:42 remaining. Including the end of the third quarter, Detroit went 7:57 without a field goal until Tobias Harris scored with 5:12 left. \nAndre Drummond scored 27 points with 20 rebounds for Detroit, which lost its fourth straight. \nPistons coach Stan Van Gundy blamed the slow start to the fourth quarter on the Pistons bench players. \n\u201cOur bench has not played well on this trip,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cWe maybe have to change up our rotations. Our bench has been really, really good for us, but now has not been.\u201d \nReggie Jackson\u2019s jumper pulled Detroit within 97-94, but Bledsoe tipped in his own miss to make it 99-94 with 32.1 seconds to play. \n\u201cGiannis and Bledsoe made some big plays down the stretch with some offensive rebounds,\u201d Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. \u201cJust the confidence that those two have in one another and in the team is great. Nobody is panicking trying to execute the play.\u201d \nMilwaukee led 64-53 after an alley-oop dunk by John Henson with 9:55 left in the third quarter. \nThe Pistons answered with a 14-2 spurt to take a 67-66 lead. Harris scored the final eight points of the run, including a 3-pointer to cap the stretch with 6:09 remaining in the third. \nHarris had 21 points, and Avery Bradley scored 20. \n\u201cWe just need to keep our head up,\u201d Drummond said. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow these losses to get us down. It is a long season.\u201d \nTIP-INS \nPistons: Forward Jon Leuer was out with a left ankle sprain. \u2026 After coming off the bench Monday against San Antonio, forward Stanley Johnson returned to the starting lineup. Forward Anthony Tolliver moved to the bench. \nBucks: Guard Jason Terry is expected to miss multiple weeks with a left calf strain suffered Monday against Boston. \u2026 Playing double-digit minutes for the first time since Oct. 31, guard Rashad Vaughn scored 11 points in 17 minutes. \nGREEK FREAK BIRTHDAY \nAntetokounmpo celebrated his 23rd birthday Wednesday. He has the most points (5,364), rebounds (2,407) and assists (1,230) in Bucks history before turning 23. \nHis 30 games of scoring at least 30 points before reaching 23 years old is second to only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s 32 in franchise history. \nRETURNING HOME \nFormer Marquette star and Wisconsin native Henry Ellenson returned to the building where he played college basketball. Ellenson has played in just nine games for Detroit this season, averaging 4.2 points and 2.6 rebounds. \nUP NEXT \nPistons: Detroit hosts Golden State on Friday night. \nBucks: Milwaukee continues a three-game homestand against Dallas on Friday night. \nMore AP basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew gruman", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ellenson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andre drummond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bledsoe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rashad vaughn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antetokounmpo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reggie jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giannis antetokounmpo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middleton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giannis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason kidd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony tolliver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm brogdon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon leuer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason terry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stan van gundy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanley johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drummond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kareem abdul-jabbar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "van gundy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henry ellenson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khris middleton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tobias harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "avery bradley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric bledsoe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john henson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pistons", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "milwaukee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marquette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san antonio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "golden state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "detroit pistons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milwaukee bucks", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "milwaukee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milwaukee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "832480bb2b23f2a76f37491b5e6ae7a9fd364d6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQI61t5tCK0F8mh3xreV9FrGZ6APlcv7xXqZv6.weGYx8vi_M1qS01o5G47CqkMCuA-", "site_full": "www.smokstak.com", "site": "smokstak.com", "site_section": "https://www.smokstak.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=3", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "tech"], "section_title": "SmokStak\u00ae Antique Engine Community - SmokStak", "title": "Strange old Honda outboard", "title_full": "Strange old Honda outboard - SmokStak", "published": "2014-02-13T09:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4525471a556c47287d270634664f42959a15eaf3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQI61t5tCK0F8mh3xreV9FrGZ6APlcv7xXqZv6.weGYx8vi_M1qS01oS3Hh8qXwUA7JgUXvdoP7FD4Nqae3gZ6Z", "ord_in_thread": 8, "author": "restore man", "published": "2017-12-07T12:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : Hi Chester,\nI knew someone would hit the jackpot !\nDo you have any more information, and any chance of a picture or a link to a web site ?\nI take it that this model is quite rare so I don't hold any hope of acquiring any parts to restore it.

In all aspects. But, the fact is, we\u2019re rivals now,\u201d he said, as reported by Football.London . \nYou\u2019d like to think Arsenal already knew plenty about Borussia Dortmund\u2019s best players, having come up against them numerous times in recent seasons. They wouldn\u2019t need to poach their best scout in order to obtain that information. Sven Mislintat, Arsenal\u2019s new Head of Recruitment. \nDortmund may hope that Mislintat will discover gems from elsewhere, rather than target their best players, but it seems Arsenal could consider poaching their talent if they need to strengthen in any area. \nMislintat discovered some of Dortmund\u2019s finest players, including Ousmane Dembele, Shinji Kagawa, Robert Lewandowski and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. \nIf he can identify even a fraction of that talent for Arsenal, it would have been worth the effort to bring him to the club. \nIt\u2019s unknown what Dortmund players Arsenal already had on their shortlist, but I believe they stand a better chance of procuring their signature with Mislintat on their side.

Taylor won the Golden Boot in the Euros with five goals. \nIn what has been an outstanding year for women\u2019s sport, with inspirational individual and team performances, Jodie beat off competition from World Champion canoeist Mallory Franklin in second place and Jo Konta, the first British woman to reach the Wimbledon singles semi-finals since 1978, in third.

Taylor also feels her playing style is better suited to America, and will make her return there in the coming months.

None of them have denied that they\u2019d like to be playing every week in the league if possible, but they haven\u2019t made a big deal out of it. \nThey\u2019ve just stuck to their tasks and got the results needed to progress in Europe. As a result, the Premier League players haven\u2019t had to come in and help out, and the two squads staying mostly separate has significantly reduced the number of injuries Wenger\u2019s to deal with. \nAs long as the Premier League and Europa League squad continue picking up results, it\u2019s the perfect scenario for Arsenal this season. Hopefully the players can keep up the positive attitude in the coming months.

Most researchers studying taste focus only on the external taste hairs, however, and overlook the pharynx, which is harder to access. Image shows mouthparts in wild type flies (left). Pharyngeal taste neurons marked by green fluorescent proteins are shown in three different pharyngeal taste organs in the distal (red), middle (blue), and proximal (purple) parts of the pharynx. Image credit: Dahanukar lab, UC Riverside. \nAnupama Dahanukar , an associate professor of molecular, cell, and systems biology , and Yu-Chieh David Chen, her graduate student, were able to examine the molecular identities of pharyngeal neurons in the fruit fly, a powerful genetic model organism for studying insect behaviors, by making the neurons fluorescent. The fluorescence helped them understand, at a molecular level, how the pharyngeal neurons were organized. \n\u201cUsing transgenic flies, we were able to examine the expression of fluorescent proteins designed to reflect patterns of chemosensory receptors in pharyngeal taste neurons in the fly and draw a precise molecular map of these organs, which has not been done before,\u201d said Dahanukar, who led the research project. \u201cWe were also able to manipulate selected groups of these neurons to figure out whether they inform the fly to eat certain foods or to avoid them.\u201d \nSuch genetic manipulation of neurons in insects could have vast applications in curbing the spread of mosquito-borne diseases and reducing crop damage by controlling the feeding behavior of mosquitoes and agricultural pests, respectively. Malaria alone killed about 438,000 people in the world in 2015; approximately, 3-4 billion people are at risk of contracting dengue or malaria each year. Losses to U.S. crop and forest production are estimated at $40 billion annually. \n\u201cThe important role that a fly\u2019s pharyngeal taste organs play in regulating food choice has gone largely unappreciated until recently,\u201d said Michael Gordon , an associate professor of biology at the University of British Columbia, who was not involved in the research. \u201cAnupama and David\u2019s very careful and detailed mapping of specific pharyngeal cell types offers important insights into the logic of chemical detection in these organs. It also provides a framework for further understanding the complexities of taste\u2019s impact on fly feeding behaviors.\u201d \nStudy results appear in Cell Reports . \n\u201cThe genetic toolkit we have defined can allow us to manipulate selected classes of pharyngeal taste neurons and examine consequences of these manipulations of various functions,\u201d Chen said. \nChen and Dahanukar also found that the fly\u2019s pharyngeal taste organs share some features with taste hairs on the external organs. Other features, such as co-expression (or lack thereof) of certain receptors, may be unique to pharyngeal organs. \n\u201cIt has been suspected that information from pharyngeal organs might be interpreted differently from information coming from external organs, because neurons from different organs connect to different circuits in the brain,\u201d said Dahanukar, a member of the Institute for Integrative Genome Biology at UCR. \u201cBut molecular differences between the two suggest that the nature of the information might also be different. Pharyngeal organs may sample chemicals differently from external organs or these internal neurons may sense other food attributes, which help the fly decide whether or not to ingest it.\u201d \nTo achieve fluorescence in the fly\u2019s pharyngeal taste neurons, Dahanukar and Chen mated two transgenic flies, with one parent fly having a GAL4 transgene under the control of regulatory regions of different chemosensory receptors and the other parent having a UAS-GFP transgene. When the two transgenic flies mated, the offspring\u2019s pharyngeal taste neurons showed fluorescence in patterns that reflect expression of those chemosensory receptors. \nChen explained that the UAS-GFP transgene allows expression of the green fluorescence protein, but it cannot achieve this on its own. To generate fluorescence, a chemoreceptor-GAL4 is needed to turn on the genes downstream of the UAS sequence. \n\u201cThe reason we don\u2019t introduce both GAL4 and UAS transgenes in the same fly but instead separate the GAL4 and UAS transgenes into different transgenic fly lines is that we want to make these fly lines more versatile for combinatorial experiments,\u201d he said. \u201cConsider capsaicin, an active component of chili peppers that flies cannot taste. If we can express a capsaicin receptor in a pharyngeal neuron of the fly using a particular combination of chemosensory-GAL4 and UAS-capsaicin transgenes, then that neuron now has the receptor for capsaicin. This means capsaicin can now activate this neuron. In this way, we can give the fly any taste receptor we want and alter the fly\u2019s behavior. By artificially activating selective neurons, we can make the fly approach a certain food or move away from it.\u201d \nBased on their location in the food canal, pharyngeal taste organs have been thought to be important for controlling feeding behaviors. More and more studies indicate that pharyngeal taste neurons and circuits may be key players in feeding, hunger, reward, and memory. \n\u201cIt\u2019s crucial to study these neurons, which are often bypassed in previous research, because we know food must pass through the pharynx,\u201d Chen said. \u201cFocusing only on the external taste organs, such as the legs and wings, could lead to incorrect or incomplete conclusions. Our paper provides road maps of pharyngeal taste organs in an insect model system for probing the role of these understudied neurons in controlling feeding behaviors.\u201d \nNow that Dahanukar and Chen have genetic toolkits to manipulate fly neurons, they plan to study individual pharyngeal neurons to fully understand what role they play in the fly\u2019s feeding behavior.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael gordon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anupama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anupama dahanukar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yu-chieh david chen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dahanukar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zika", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "institute for integrative genome biology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uc riverside", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riverside", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:03.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9dda26000cdd388dfd5327b3cfdeaa5f56b65d24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2BZJIr0xmh7Muj7_1nnrvdPSb6Y88GFJz6YI8US8pJaIYXP3opCQrbP.Vr67dmf1ySETQQ3H0zF0WtvLUYujuTk81ADNE_nA6fY3R6i0KsHlgddGDBWfCTeYmyGudSntsitIg5Aya0Y1khZiNs54wlsP82M4YzgPGEap95ZqzOA--", "site_full": "www.flipkart.com", "site": "flipkart.com", "site_section": "https://www.flipkart.com/mens-clothing/suits-blazers/united-colors-of-benetton~brand/pr?sid=2oq,s9b,q9f&otracker=categorytree&p[]=sort=recency_desc", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "United Colors Of Benetton Suits Blazers Online at Best Prices In India | Flipkart.com", "title": "Solly Jeans Co Single Breasted Casual Blazer Solly Jeans Co Single Breasted Casual Blazer,", "title_full": "Reviews Solly Jeans Co Solid Single Breasted Casual Men S Blazer -

12/7/17 12:41 AM \nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 DeMarcus Cousins employed a hesitation dribble between his legs as he approached center Kenneth Faried in the lane. The Pelicans big man then spun between Faried and converging Denver forward Wilson Chandler and was fouled as he converted a leaning scoop off the glass. \nIt was perhaps the best of many highlights for Cousins, who had 40 points, 22 rebounds and four blocks to help New Orleans down Denver 123-114 on Wednesday night. \n\u201cJust trying to make a play, doing whatever it takes to help the team win a game. Tonight was my night,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cYou kind of get locked in and you know when you\u2019re rolling, of course, but it\u2019s still all about making the right play because eventually they adjust.\u201d \nJrue Holiday scored 27 points and E\u2019Twaun Moore had 14 for New Orleans, which shot 53.5 percent (46 of 86) and won for the second time in three games without All-Star forward Anthony Davis. \nGary Harris scored 24 for the short-handed Nuggets, who remained without recently injured frontcourt stalwarts Nikola Jokic and Paul Millsap. \n\u201cThey\u2019re not as deep as they usually are at the big spot and they were a bit under-sized,\u201d Cousins said in explaining why he was aggressive from the outset. \nThe Pelicans liked what they saw and let Cousins dictate the offense. \n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to stop him. Just give him the ball, really,\u201d Holiday said. \u201cHe should have had 50. He missed a couple free throws.\u201d \nCousins missed seven, in fact, but it hardly mattered. \nEmmanuel Mudiay scored 17 points, while Will Barton and Jamal Murray each scored 15 for the Nuggets, who were as close as 97-94 after Malik Beasley\u2019s 3 with 11:25 to go, only to fade down the stretch. \nThe Pelicans broke the game open in the fourth quarter with a decisive 20-3 run during which Cousins scored six points and blocked two shots. That made the score 117-97, and Denver didn\u2019t threaten again. \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t guard anybody,\u201d Denver coach Mike Malone said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming the same story every single night. Until our guys start taking it personally, until our guys start understating the importance of playing defense and guarding your man 1-on-1, forget playoffs. That is a word we should not use for this team.\u201d \nCousins has now had at least 40 points and 20 rebounds in a game twice this season, the first time coming in a victory at Sacramento on Oct. 26. \n\u201cI\u2019m not really focused on the numbers,\u201d insisted Cousins, who played 39:34 and scored his last point with 23 seconds left. \u201cWe got a win. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d \nTIP-INS \nNuggets: Trey Lyles had 10 points and 11 rebounds. \u2026 Jokic missed his third straight game with a left ankle sprain, while Millsap missed his eighth straight with a left wrist injury. \u2026 Barton was assessed a technical foul for arguing after officials called a defensive foul on Denver on Cousins\u2019 missed layup. \nPelicans: Davis missed his third straight game with a strained left adductor. His status for New Orleans\u2019 next game remains unclear. \u2026 Tony Allen was called for a technical foul in the third quarter for complaining to officials from the bench that they\u2019d blown a call when they gave possession to Denver after replays clearly showed the ball going out off of a Nuggets player. \u2026 Darius Miller has made at least one 3 in 17 straight games. \nDEFENSIVE DEFICIENCIES \nThe Nuggets made 10 of 19 3-point attempts in the first half, when they shot 51 percent overall and led by as many as 10 points. \nNew Orleans shot nearly 57 percent, with Cousins and Holiday each scoring 19 points during the first two quarters, after which New Orleans led 67-66. \n\u201cIn the first half we kind of got sucked into playing their style of play, just trying to outscore one another,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cWe came in at half and said the first team to play a little bit of defense is going to be the team to win the game.\u201d \nQUOTABLE \nCousins was upset that officials reviewed a play in which Mason Plumlee crashed dramatically to the court after Cousins\u2019 elbow came near the Denver forward\u2019s face as Cousins secured a rebound. Replays did not show obvious contact, and officials decided to uphold their original call that Plumlee committed a foul. On Nov. 20, Cousins was ejected after a similar play involving Oklahoma City\u2019s Russell Westbrook. \n\u201cJust the antics. It\u2019s silly man, like, just let me live,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cJust trying to villainize me and the way that it\u2019s going, I hate it. Just let me be a basketball player.

I got to wear it today for our first true cold day it\u2019s just about perfect! \nI have to apologize for the quality of the photos. It was overcast today so the pictures aren\u2019t as vibrant as I would like. But, I realized I didn\u2019t really want to take additional photos tomorrow and I need to blog my coat to move on to my next project. Better to have A photo than no blog post at all. \nNow, on to the coat! \nLikes: It\u2019s a duffle coat! I\u2019ve always loved and wanted to own a duffle coat. But, have never found a RTW version that fit me well because I\u2019m busty with a big booty. I\u2019m thrilled I made it from plaid. I love plaid but rarely sew with it because matching stresses me out. \nThe color is really great on me and will be cheerful this winter. The lining is from flannel back satin so the hood won\u2019t destroy my curly hair and provides a lot of warmth \ud83d\ude00 \nDislikes: \nI notice the back hem doesn\u2019t lay as flat as I\u2019d like and the front hem rises. Originally I thought this was the result of not making a long enough FBA at the front and too large a new-to-me swayback adjustment (I took the extra length at center back out at the neckline). \nBut, when I now look at this plaid version from the designer above, I see that the back hem flares out / away the same way and the front hem also rises. I also see on the designer version that the black plaid between the bust and waist rise, as mine does despite a FBA. I don\u2019t notice this on all versions of this coat online though. I\u2019ve pressed the hem over a ham to have it curve a bit more but it\u2019s not enough. Maybe I\u2019ll send it out for a profesh press. I\u2019m not sure what causes the flare. Could be a rounded vs straight hem. Maybe the lining should be a bit shorter to pull the hem in place more? Maybe the rounded hem biased a bit? Perhaps the back should all be interfaced. I\u2019m not sure and I\u2019m willing to live with it in this version. \nIf I were making this again, I would extend the length of the zipper band and use a 30\u2033 vs 23\u2033 zipper. I\u2019ve noticed on a few versions that the lower front splays open a bit. I assumed that was fabric cut off grain. But, I now think a longer zipper would go a long way to keeping it closed. The zipper stops at the hip length shorter version length. Which does make it easier for zipping up. But, I\u2019d just go longer. The center front band is also too long. There is an updated pattern piece on the Grainline site. But, it\u2019s about 1.5 inches or so too long. \nAs for the zipper band, I did choose to interface mine. I\u2019d also recommend reinforcing the bottom where the zipper stop is. I managed to pop mine loose while squatting to put put on my dog\u2019s halter. It can take a lot of pressure there. \nI would also not have done it in a contrast color for the zipper band. It peeks open a bit at the top by my neck and it wouldn\u2019t bother me as much if the colors were the same. \nThanks to a year of lifting weights my body has changed \u2014 a lot. I should have made a broad back adjustment and added another inch to the width of the sleeves at the bicep (for a total of 2\u2033). I can wear this with slim to medium garments underneath \u2013 nothing thicker than a ponte or wool jersey knit. But, certainly not a heavy sweater. Thanks to the flannel back satin lining though this is warm enough for Baltimore on it\u2019s own. It took wearing of all my other outerwear this fall to realize how much my body has changed. None of my coats fit particularly well through the bodice right now. That said, this is well suited for a big chunk of Maryland winters. My next coat will be have boxy fit for oversized winter garments. \nAll of these issues could have been caught with a muslin which I chose not to do. I just couldn\u2019t deal with all these pieces! That said, I hope most of what I see if just what I see. Overall I am happy but would be thrilled with a few tweaks. And, I would make another duffle. Just not in plaid \ud83d\ude00 \nNow, I need to start working on Jordan\u2019s Hanukkah gift. I promised him an aviator jacket and have a week to get it done. Also, I have other coat plans for m . \nIf you\u2019ve stumbled on this final post, check out these other posts I wrote about alterations , cutting the plaid and tailoring the coat . \nSave Save Save Save Save Save", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "fba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "save save save save save save", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "baltimore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:03.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ad149bda1505e76497caf79db09066ebc406535", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCskm_gl44z3dUWwsHwOXTAfFo12LUQPt8Ersw.NBrCuraCPNayJwR_QvgQVaN9flonPmK0vbRyhdTa4L8_y2Nzvmbu0kXd0TPaqXaAcEZyTugBmJvjurl1kSRjTHuNiM-", "site_full": "www.dealighted.com", "site": "dealighted.com", "site_section": "https://www.dealighted.com/dealighted_rss.xml", "site_categories": ["couponing", "shopping"], "section_title": "Dealighted.com Top User Posted Deals", "title": "Zoomer Chimp Interactive Chimp - Untamed Fun $39.98", "title_full": "Zoomer Chimp Interactive Chimp - Untamed Fun $39.98", "published": "2017-12-07T15:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 68695, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6ad149bda1505e76497caf79db09066ebc406535", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCskm_gl44z3dUWwsHwOXTAfFo12LUQPt8Ersw.NBrCuraCPNayJwR_QvgQVaN9flonPmK0vbRyhdTa4L8_y2Nzvmbu0kXd0TPaqXaAcEZyTugBmJvjurl1kSRjTHuNiM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T15:31:00.000+02:00", "title": "Zoomer Chimp Interactive Chimp - Untamed Fun $39.98", "text": "More Deals & Coupons Like \"Zoomer Chimp Interactive Chimp - Untamed Fun .98\" \n28 Nov, 6:05 am Coupon by Coupons Editor \n28 Nov, 12:53 am", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:03.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5ac47527cc7a5395abdb557700d26796a463c76a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94ovzWkJ_LjctYs04iYtNO5wYh.iwcMXVzEtT5C.ES2_L0Lq04lVV_4mHmV4UARsygmjZKO.DsYKze0p5R4e098orE5igCkIuBfA--", "site_full": "www.amazonforum.com", "site": "amazonforum.com", "site_section": "https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/kindle-e-readers", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Kindle E-readers - Devices - Amazon Digital and Device Forum ", "title": "kindle e-reader", "title_full": "kindle e-reader - Kindle E-readers - Devices - Amazon Digital and Device Forum", "published": "2017-12-07T07:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.035, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4482ae9c99e70eff7b00e3c3b8a3017dbdf6405d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94ovzWkJ_LjctYs04iYtNO5wYh.iwcMXVzEtT5C.ES2_L0Lq04lVV_4mHmV4UARsygmjZKO.DsYKze0p5R4e098opDOVJpO3ySGC2X039fKcYG", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "jumptherope", "published": "2017-12-07T16:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: from doofer45 >> If I purchase a new kindle e-reader, how do I transfer all of my book library from my old Kindle Fire to the new Kindle e-reader?\n Is your new KINDLE registered to your Amazon Account?

We voted many times and you have to respect, that is what you call democracy, the majority voted for CL teams to go back to Europa League and in many, many years they won it.\u201d \nIt does seem a bit bizarre that teams like Celtic, who picked up just one win in the group stages can now play in the same knockout rounds as Arsenal. It devalues the competition, and runs the risk of the Champions League rejects knocking out the sides who started the season in the tournament.

(Photo by Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images) \nMost Champions League teams might consider the competition more of a hindrance. The two-legged Europa League knockout rounds will clog their fixture list, and the reward of Champions League football for winning the competition is probably an unnecessary one for most teams anyway. \nThe likes of Celtic, Napoli, Atletico Madrid and Sporting Lisbon are already in the Champions League spots in their respective countries. So, I\u2019m with Wenger on this one. \nI don\u2019t want Champions League teams joining us in the next round, and I\u2019ve never wanted us to drop into the Europa League in previous years either. Unfortunately, as Wenger says, this is just how it is.

Arsenal do have a very large squad, but squad rotation will be key over the festive period to limit injuries. \nIn all honesty, it probably wasn\u2019t very likely that Mustafi would play in the Europa League match, as he\u2019s only appeared once in the competition so far this season. \nThere are plenty of alternatives available at the back.

In the first half of 2017, over 237,000 worthless counterfeit banknotes with a notional value of over \u00a34.88 million were removed from the UK\u2019s streets. While less than 1% of notes in circulation are counterfeit, this is not a victimless crime. Many retailers, businesses, schools, charities and the elderly have been conned out of money using fake notes. Christmas is a time when more cash changes hands, especially \u00a320 and \u00a350 notes, and fraudsters take advantage of the festive season by targeting busy shops with temporary staff. Incidents include scammers tricking innocent members of the public into swapping fake \u00a320 notes for two genuine \u00a310 notes, and businesses being left out of pocket if they take a counterfeit note. Counterfeit notes are also known to be linked to serious and organised criminal gangs. One gang was sentenced to over three years\u2019 imprisonment for the manufacture of \u00a3320,000 worth of fake notes. In another more recent case, three men were prosecuted after \u00a340,000 of fake notes were found in a Kent property that was also used to supply cannabis. As well as raising public awareness of fake banknotes, in October Crimestoppers partnered with the Bank of England to launch the Banknote Checking Scheme. Aimed at cash-handling businesses, it promotes banknote checking at point of sale through targeted training, with the aim of reducing the number of counterfeit notes being accepted. Further information on fake notes can be found on Crimestoppers\u2019 web page, at fakenotes.co.uk . Director of Operations for Crimestoppers, Roger Critchell, said: \u201cFake notes are completely worthless and knowingly holding or passing on counterfeit notes is a crime\u201d. \u201cThe purpose of this campaign is to raise awareness of counterfeit money, especially around Christmas when money can be tight, but also to highlight how heartless and callous fraudsters can be when targeting their victims\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d ask that anyone with information on those selling counterfeit notes contact Crimestoppers anonymously, safe in the knowledge no one will know you spoke to us, and knowing you may have prevented someone\u2019s Christmas from being ruined.\u201d Ben Crosland, Senior Manager of Banknote Engagement and Communications at the Bank of England, said: \u201cThe general public play an important role when it comes to reporting counterfeit currency. Campaigns like this and the recently launched Banknote Checking Scheme, are essential to encourage the public and businesses to help us and law enforcement stop the counterfeiters.\u201d If you have information on those making, selling or buying counterfeit notes then contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at crimestoppers-uk.org/give-info .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger critchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben crosland", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "operations for crimestoppers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank of england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banknote engagement and communications", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:04.069+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fa2c3ba1ee40493588189308122ff03b67e8e643", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMoDRxHCvbvtUdgFM3klLQY7GsRGZaDuOwll4E5LbDljjbHUbi4qmbIhTg0F64pvNPyzhxV7ix9KCF4Zjz8qYFWtxN2re4OEf9ZzCKteC7tgNg--", "site_full": "thethingsshemakes.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://thethingsshemakes.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Things She Makes", "title": "DIY Christmas | Wire Star Wreath", "title_full": "DIY Christmas | Wire Star Wreath", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fa2c3ba1ee40493588189308122ff03b67e8e643", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMoDRxHCvbvtUdgFM3klLQY7GsRGZaDuOwll4E5LbDljjbHUbi4qmbIhTg0F64pvNPyzhxV7ix9KCF4Zjz8qYFWtxN2re4OEf9ZzCKteC7tgNg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sophie Stansfield (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "DIY Christmas | Wire Star Wreath", "text": "Make your own door/mantle/wall wreath! This everlasting star wreath will make a stylish addition to your home or dress up your front door and can be adapted to suit your colour scheme!\n\nLast year, I made an Ivy wreath with trimmings from the garden, but for 2017, I've made an everlasting wreath to bring out each year.\n\n| WHAT YOU NEED |\n\nWire Star Frame |  Eucalyptus |  Hot Glue Gun | Floral Wire | Wire Cutters \nFrom Poundland: Gypsophila | White Berries | Frosted Pines \n\n| HOW YOU MAKE IT |\n\nThere are two approaches to this - minimal, making the wire star a feature [ Hobbycraft have some great examples of this on their blog ] or to use the star as a frame for a more full, traditional wreath.\n\nI decided to cover the frame completely, using the same simple materials as the mantle wreath/tablescapes: gypsophila, eucalyptus, berries and pinecones.\nStart with your base colour and texture.  For me, this is always gypsophila as it has good coverage, a little goes a long way and it adds a little detail with its small flowers.  I spread evenly adding one sprig to each side, the spring facing towards each point of the star, securing in place with floral wire at the base[trimmed to size to use only what was required]:\nAlthough I like symmetry, as with the mantle garlands, I didn't pay too much attention to the sides being completely equal in length or fullness.\nI then added the eucalyptus - the main feature of the wreath.  Following the same direction as the gypsophila, I trimmed the base of each sprig close to the first set of leaves and staying close to the lines of the wire star to keep the shape:\nTwo sprigs were used on each side for consistency, but I also trimmed smaller sections to close gaps, add more shape and help make the wreath appear more 'full':\nThe white berries and frosted mini pinecones details were then added.  I decided to add these in a fairly random manner throughout the wreath, but did concentrate on areas that needed colour breaking up, wire covering up and fullness or detail adding to the shape.  Starting with the berries:\nThen adding the pinecones:\n\nI used hot glue to secure them in place and layer the wreath.\n\nOnce I added all my details, I finished the wreath with leaves from the eucalyptus, removed from the stem and glued these in place where extra fullness was needed and also to the back of the wreath to add more shape and a little protection at the back.\n\nThere are so many ways that you can decorate a simple wire frame to suit your d\u00e9cor, colour scheme and style - and can be easily updated or changed each year.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "poundland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:04.083+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "427d0f417f9828b6e764e5e19e0b6ac7a92f51d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPdlUDM5ZQS_rEKrqzWb0OI8El1Yv9H8PGjl3AmnKJwzKTmUBHLuO1SRutkKXqseQFA--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g293860-i511-India.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "India Forum, Travel Discussion for India - TripAdvisor", "title": "E-Visa Rejected - Goa", "title_full": "E-Visa Rejected - Goa Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-07T09:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b720ada5b5f2ddd60cce742ffd161552243f9ab8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPdlUDM5ZQS_rEKrqzWb0OI8El1Yv9H8PGjl3AmnKJwzKTmUBHLuO1SQjyOxe9fRTx0M3oqGmykd4", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Lofty45", "published": "2017-12-07T12:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I used them as well not a problem do t have computer at home just took a photo on smart phone emailed it to them plus passport photo page all good they sort everything will use them again", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:00:04.101+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50a90772c1b6ee822fedd84fcf11dbb2faefad57", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUUC4XTyMkcenOwqe_lx2oI4nBnz1I4E8VSKALyBCBRkrqrxKYBaXTuEDgZvcP1k2PyYXsQ6aI3TAziOdL6lPa2fisXReCdEtiuJdlgqxeYx", "site_full": "www.expedia.com", "site": "expedia.com", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com/Wan-Chai-Hong-Kong-Hotels.0-n12123-0.Travel-Guide-Filter-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Wan Chai Hotels: Compare 777 Hotels in Wan Chai, Hong Kong | Expedia", "title": "Kew Green Hotel Wanchai HK (Formerly Metropark Wanchai):", "title_full": "Kew Green Hotel Wanchai HK (Formerly Metropark Wanchai): 2017 Room Prices, Deals & Reviews | Expedia", "published": "2017-10-22T11:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 416, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "37f09c378eb7cb17babd1a34bda700942ae79c5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUUC4XTyMkcenOwqe_lx2oI4nBnz1I4E8VSKALyBCBRkrqrxKYBaXTuEDgZvcP1k2PyYXsQ6aI3TAziOdL6lPa2fisXReCdEtqxmBey6fBBIR..4Vp86Pjrx.DOlaS.oBMBCh6PUlxGP", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-07T01:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Habe keine Lust hier was zu schreiben.

I don\u2019t expect it to be like that every single game, but tonight I thought it called for it.\u201d \nCoach Steve Kerr called it a luxury to turn from one MVP to another in a time of need. \nHe said Durant simply took over. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much a vocal leadership role, but more of an \u2018I got this\u2019 type of thing,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIt was the way he carried himself. He was clearly the best player on the floor and the dominant player on the floor. Without Steph, he almost had a different bounce to his step, like \u2018This one is mine, I got it.'\u201d \nKlay Thompson scored seven of his 22 points in the fourth quarter for the Warriors, who have won five straight overall and seven in a row against the Hornets. \nCurry will be sidelined for about two weeks with a sprained ankle, while Green is nursing a sore shoulder. \nIt hardly mattered. \nDurant set the tone, scoring 16 points on 6-of-9 shooting in the first quarter to help the Warriors build a 26-18 lead. The edge increased to 26 in the second quarter following back-to-back 3-pointers by Nick Young, who had 10 points. \n\u201cEven without those other guys, they\u2019re still pretty good,\u201d said Hornets associate head coach Stephen Silas, who is leading the team while Steve Clifford is dealing with a health issue. \u201cObviously with Kevin Durant and Klay it was hard to stop those guys tonight.\u201d \nKemba Walker led the Hornets with 24 points, while Nic Batum added 15 and Dwight Howard 14. \nCharlotte cut the lead to 11 at the end of the third quarter behind 10 points from Batum but didn\u2019t make a serious run at the lead thanks to a strong fourth quarter from Thompson. \nTIP INS \nWarriors: Golden State (20-6) had 24 fast-break points against a team that had been allowing the second-fewest fast-break points in the league at 7.5 per game. \u2026 Patrick McCaw did not play because of a bruised nose. \nHornets: Charlotte attempted one free throw in the first half after attempting 40 on Monday night against the Orlando Magic. \nWHAT\u2019S COOKING: Quinn Cook started at point guard for the Warriors and had eight points, three assists and three rebounds. \nKerr said his play was fantastic. \n\u201cI knew Quinn would play well,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe\u2019s played a lot of minutes for New Orleans last year and we have watched him in practice in the G league. \u2026 We have a lot of synergy between the franchises and we run the same stuff, so Quinn knows all of the plays.\u201d \nINJURED HORNETS: Just when the Hornets finally got everyone back healthy, they lost two big men off the bench.

There are five new stamp sets - each with cute elements that can be inserted in their mouth (or tummy as in my card today).  You can mix and match what items you choose, and there are at least two sentiments in each set.  Here is Kangaroo Mouthful Set (Sku #4947):\nThe set includes all the dies to cut out the small accessories and the little \"Roo\".  There is also a die that you place over the kangaroo's pouch that will perfectly cut the slit to insert the present (it can be pulled out).  Such a great, interactive card - the horn is inserted in his mouth, but sticks up, the present can be pulled out, and the sentiment and Roo are both attached with Pop dots.  Our current challenge is Funny & Punny - so head over to the Ai blog to see what the rest of the team has created, and you can link up your creation while you're there.

Only time Gil will fail is against lancers which even then is a maybe.\nHans is good, but you would really want someone who can star gen. If it fails you want a high stat berserker to fill in the blank class match ups.\nMany people would suggest raising your Kiyohime to max (and some grail) with full on fou cards. That's until you can get another farming zerker like tamacat or zerkerlot, or some fairly distant berserkers.\nHans is a bit meh, but he is solid for both farm and boss, so it's good to invest.\nBesides that I wouldn't invest much until kiyohime is maxed out. Maybe Medea for ST damage, but that's really only on Riders, so not even then, there are so many better casters (sadly you missed Caster-liz)\nThen you should focus on your 4* saber. He/she isn't much but still a decent middle ground 4*, and Ceaser is pretty meh outside of some support and ST damage, and his mats are annoying.\nSame with Cu-lancer. He's serviceable, but ultimately loses out to stats, and he's not really a farming lancer.\nYou first priority should be to get a farming team up, and about centered around Gil. Then worry about boss battles...because realistically.\nFarm team = everything you need, and still decent at boss battles.\nBoss fighters generally is a luxury of simply doing it with less efficiency. And event boss battles usually force you into event servants anyway.\nAnd people think too highly of Robinhood. Honestly...he sucks. He's a crappy archer, he's a unstable ST NP, and he doesn't even have that good of a stat in NP charge, start gen, or card spread.\nRobin can hit hard only if poison lands which it may not, and then it's only ST for better or worse, which he has crappy skill set and does tickle damage outside NP.\nThere is like no reason to try a robin hood here if you have a Gil, or even any servicable 4*, outside of needing an arts NP.\nUnlike assassins or riders which kinda has issues with getting a good all purpose one or not (luckly we get some great welfare assassins and riders), Archers are highly serviceable to roll on majority, same with casters, lancers.\nYou just need a solid Saber who's can act like a Saber... The rest will come. A good saber will be able to tank 2/3rd of the classes and pump out enough damage to carry their weight. A nice saber will generally be a great team anchor if you can level them past the enemy via raw stats. Cu-lancer is good in a pinch but his stats...
