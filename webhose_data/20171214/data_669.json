Ashley Judd, Susan Fowler, Adama Iwu, Taylor Swift, and Isabel Pascual (a pseudonym) on the Time magazine Person of the Year cover. - Time Inc. via Reuters \u201cThis is the fastest moving social change we\u2019ve seen in decades and it began with individual acts of courage by hundreds of women - and some men, too - who came forward to tell their own stories,\u201d Time Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal told NBC News, referring to them as \u201cthe silence breakers.\u201dThe recognition comes amid a wave of public allegations of sexual misconduct that have targeted some of the most prominent men in U.S. politics, media and entertainment, leading to multiple firings and investigations.As more people made their accusations public, other individuals also shared their own stories of assault and harassment, often with posts on social media platforms using the hashtag #MeToo.\u201cI could never had envisioned something that would change the world. I was trying to change my community,\u201d Tarana Burke, the hashtag\u2019s creator, told NBC. \u201cThis is just the start. It\u2019s not just a moment, it\u2019s a movement. Now the work really begins.\u201dU.S. President Donald Trump, who was Time\u2019s person of the year in 2016, was the first runner-up this year, followed by Chinese President Xi Jinping, Felsenthal said.Other finalists included North Korean President Kim Jong Un, \u201cWonder Woman\u201d director Patty Jenkins and football player-turned-activist Colin Kaepernick, among others.Time\u2019s annual distinction recognizes the person, group, thing or idea that it has determined had the greatest influence on events for the year.A Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday found nearly half of U.S. women said they had been sexually assaulted.Among the 1,747 American adults surveyed, 17 percent of men and 47 percent of women said they had been abused, according to the Nov. 29-Dec. 4 poll, which had a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points.The Time announcement comes one day after Representative John Conyers became the first member of Congress to step down following public allegations of misconduct and amid calls for Senator Al Franken to resign.Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and former NBC News anchor Matt Lauer also have lost their jobs amid such allegations. Trump has also been accused of inappropriately touching women and faces related litigation.

The tax was eliminated in 2010 but was reinstated a year later. Alex Wong / Getty Images \nRepublicans in Congress are on the verge of fulfilling their long-time dream of eliminating the federal estate tax, and they could do it in a way that is even more generous to heirs than previous repeal efforts. \nBills passed by the Senate and the House recently would reduce or scrap the taxes heirs now pay on estates larger than $5.5 million. And the bills would do so without repealing the so-called \"stepped-up basis\" provision. \nOrdinarily, people have to pay taxes when they sell off assets that have appreciated in value, like shares of stock or real estate. But heirs are exempted from that tax. That's because they already pay the estate tax. \nThe bills approved by Congress recently would eliminate or reduce the estate tax, while leaving the exemption in place. \nIn other words, you would be able to pass on assets that have gained a lot in value \u2014 like those Apple shares you bought years ago \u2014 and, unlike everyone else, your heirs never have to pay tax on the appreciation. \nTo put it another way: Someone could inherit her grandfather's large beachfront mansion without paying estate tax, and sell it off right away without paying any capital gains tax. \nIt's a much more generous policy than previous tax overhauls, says Lily Batchelder, a professor of law and public policy at New York University Law School. \n\"We've never seen a proposal like this,\" she says. \"I don't recall ever seeing a proposal that would both fully repeal the estate tax and fully exempt from tax all the accrued gains on these giant estates.\" \nThe bill passed by the Senate early Saturday would double the exemption on large estates, allowing people to pass on estates worth $11 million to their heirs tax-free. \nThe exemption for married couples would be $22 million. The House bill would gradually reduce the estate tax and then scrap it altogether in 2023. \nHouse and Senate leaders are now trying to reconcile the two versions of the tax overhaul, with a vote expected by the end of the month. \nThe estate tax has long been the bane of conservatives. Congress briefly eliminated the tax in 2010, but it came back the following year and remains in place today. \n\"We just think it's unfair. Death should not be a taxable event. And we should not be stopping people from being able to pass their life's work on to their kids,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told Fox News recently. \nThe estate tax brings in a relatively small amount of money to the federal Treasury, about $19 billion a year, even as it hurts the large economy, says Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation. \nBecause of the tax, people end up pouring money into tax shelters and paying hefty bills to tax lawyers, he says. \nThe tax is especially onerous for assets that may be worth a lot on paper but are cash poor, such as certain kinds of businesses, Hodge says. In some cases, heirs have to break up or sell businesses to pay taxes, he says. \nPeople who want to keep the tax say such cases are extremely rare. They also say that at a time of growing income inequality, the estate tax plays an important role in making the economy fair. \n\"The estate tax is basically a way of partially leveling the playing field, so that these heirs of massive estates don't have quite as gigantic a leg up in life,\" Batchelder says.

There, Republicans from both sides of Congress generally agree on two big changes. \nSaving for private school \nTaxpayers can currently save money for college through a 529 plan, where earnings grow tax-free. Many states also offer deductions for contributions. In the proposals, Republicans want to let taxpayers use 529s to pay for K-12 tuition at private and religious schools, too. Families can already do that with a different plan \u2014 Coverdell Education Savings Accounts \u2014 but these have low contribution limits and aren't open to high-income Americans. The move to expand the 529 would dramatically increase who could use these plans and the money they could save. \n\"I think the only taxpayers who will be in a position to benefit from the 529 change are very rich people,\" says Nora Gordon, an economist and associate professor at Georgetown University. She says using these accounts to save for elementary or high school won't help much unless you can afford to set aside a lot of money early on. No wonder, when the Government Accountability Office studied 529s and Coverdells a few years ago, it found \"families with these accounts had about 25 times the median financial assets\" of those who didn't use them and \"about three times the median income.\" \nWhile the proposed expansion of 529 plans would largely help affluent parents who use private schools, Republicans are proposing another change that could hurt funding for the nation's public schools. \nThe SALT (State And Local Taxes) deduction \nUp to now, taxpayers who itemize their deductions \u2014 generally high-earners who make up about a third of households in the U.S. \u2014 have gotten a break from the federal government for paying state and local taxes. \nThink of it as a kind of rebate \u2014 courtesy of Washington \u2014 that ultimately helps state and local governments pay for important things, like schools, among other things. \nRepublicans now want to cut that discount, getting rid of the income and sales tax deductions and putting a $10,000 cap on the deduction for property taxes. \n\"This bill is gonna make it more painful for residents to increase local property taxes to pay for public schools,\" says John Friedman, an associate professor of economics at Brown University. \nOn average, nearly half of public schools' funding (45 percent) comes from local taxes, often property taxes. In the past, when locals hiked these taxes to help pay for their schools, the federal government made the hike hurt less with that SALT deduction. So imagine, if Congress caps the property tax deduction, for high earners who already pay a lot \u2014 in places like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, even Texas \u2014 a new hike would hurt more than it used to. \n\"This is a really big deal for some states and no deal at all for other states. And the states that it's a really big deal for are blue states,\" says Nora Gordon of Georgetown. \"They're states with higher cost of living, higher property values, and states that spend more on their state and local government.\" \nWhile local taxes provide nearly half of public school dollars, state taxes account for much of the rest (46 percent). Kim Rueben of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says states often use these sales and income taxes to help their poorest schools. \n\"The money from the state ends up helping to prop up school districts that have less ability to raise money from the property tax,\" she says. Getting rid of these deductions, Rueben says, will make state-level taxes more painful for some and, again, could make it harder to raise money for schools in the future. \nImportant context: All this is happening with many school districts still reeling from the Great Recession. According to a recent analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, after adjusting for inflation, \"twenty-nine states provided less overall state funding per student in the 2015 school year than in the 2008 school year, before the recession took hold.\" \n*** \nThe two tax bills are farther apart when it comes to higher education. \nIn the House: fewer tuition benefits \nWe've heard a lot about graduate students' reaction to the proposal to tax their tuition waivers as income. \nAs Ariana Figueroa reported for NPR: \n\"Many grad students \u2014 especially in Ph.D. programs \u2014 receive tuition waivers in exchange for teaching classes or doing research. Under current law, that money isn't taxed as income. But the House bill calls for those tuition waivers to be counted as income and subjected to income taxes. \nThat means graduate students would be paying taxes on money they never receive.\" \nThe House bill also cuts or reduces other higher education tax benefits: The Hope Scholarship Credit The Lifetime Learning Credit and tuition deduction The deduction on interest for those repaying student loans The American Opportunity Tax Credit, which students and families can use to offset college tuition payments, is limited to exclude part-time and graduate students, although it is also extended for a fifth year. \nTogether, the axed benefits are worth about $6.5 billion a year to students and families, according to the American Council on Education. \nThe Senate bill doesn't include any of the above. \nState funding for public higher education may also be in jeopardy, for the same reasons we discussed above \u2014 a consequence of getting rid of the deductions for SALT. Scaling back, or cutting federal discounts to taxpayers may cause a squeeze on funding for state universities and colleges. \nPrivate college penalties \nBoth public and private colleges have expressed concern that fewer people are going to be taking the charitable deduction, because of the increase in the standard deduction. They're worried this will lead, in turn, to less money in donations. The American Council on Education estimates about $100 billion less a year in donations across all nonprofits. \nThere are also some provisions in the House and Senate bills that target private colleges specifically. One provision would levy a tax on investment gains for a small group of private colleges that have very large endowments on a per-student basis. Currently, this money grows tax-free thanks to the colleges' nonprofit status. \nThis affects about 65 private colleges with extremely large endowments. But even more colleges are worried about it, says Terry Hartle of the American Council on Education. \n\"Even though public universities are not affected by the endowment tax, they are very much opposed to it, for fear it would set a precedent that would be applied to them in the future.\" \nCulture war? \nThe tax plans, which passed on party lines in both the House and Senate, are aligned with a broader Republican agenda. On the K-12 side, cuts that impact the source of public school funding are coming hand in hand with special tax benefits for families with means to put aside money for private school tuition. \nOn the higher education side, Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and adviser to the Trump campaign, told Bloomberg that Republicans are going after university endowments because \"universities have become playpens of the left.\" Amplifying that point, a recent Pew poll showed there is a sharply rising partisan gap on higher education, with 58 percent of Republicans saying colleges have a negative effect on the country, while 72 percent of Democrats say they have a positive impact.

Tauseef Mustafa / AFP/Getty Images Originally published on December 7, 2017 2:27 am \nMonths after a tense standoff between China and India along their Himalayan border, Beijing on Thursday expressed anger at an Indian drone that crashed inside its territory. \n\"This action by India violated China's territorial sovereignty. We express strong dissatisfaction and opposition,\" Xinhua cited Zhang Shuili, a senior military official in China's western battle zone command, as saying. \nChina said the drone crashed in \"recent days\" but didn't say where. Zhang said his country would defend its national sovereignty against such intrusions. \nHe said China's border defense forces conducted \"an inspection of the device,\" but didn't elaborate. \nIndia has not responded to the charge. \nAlthough the two countries have made moves toward warmer relations in recent years, they also have a long history of border tensions. In 1962, they fought a brief, but inconclusive border conflict. They have also had ongoing disputes over sovereignty in other border areas, notably Aksai Chin, a Himalayan region that straddles their territorial demarcation in the west. \nThe two countries have also long been at odds over India's hosting of Tibet's government-in-exile and their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, considered by China to be subversive because of his calls for Tibetan independence. \nStarting in June this year, tensions flared again over a disputed region called the Doklam Plateau that borders China, Bhutan and the Indian state of Sikkim. \nAs NPR's Julie McCarthy reported from New Delhi in July , the problems stemmed from China's construction of a road in Doklam Plateau. \"Not far from the plateau lies the narrow passage that connects India's northeast states with the rest of the country \u2014 a strategic link called the Siliguri Corridor but more commonly known as the \"Chicken's Neck. \" Any possibility of China being able to sever that \"neck\" unnerves India. \nAs late as August, India had rushed troops to Doklam Plateau and although an immediate conflict was avoided, heated rhetoric on both sides has soured relations. \nIn September, India's army chief said that his country \"could not afford to be complacent and must be prepared for war,\" according to The Hindustan Times. \nAnd in November, China took umbrage at Indian President Ram Nath Kovind's visit to the remote state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims, Reuters reports.

Israeli flags are on display Wednesday on the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem. President Trump announced that the U.S. will view Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and he ordered the State Department to \"begin preparation to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv.\" The controversial move threatens to unsettle the region's volatile politics. Ahmad Gharabli / AFP/Getty Images \nPresident Trump's declaration that Jerusalem is Israel's capital and his order to move the U.S. Embassy brought quick and sharply differing reactions from Jewish, Christian and Muslim leaders. \nThe government of Israel considers Jerusalem its capital, and most Jewish-American organizations have long argued that the United States should acknowledge it as such. The 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, which called for the U.S. Embassy to be moved to Jerusalem, passed by a large bipartisan margin and was strongly supported by Jewish-American groups. \n\"It's been the consensus mainline view for decades,\" said Nathan Diament, executive director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, \"because Jerusalem is the capital city for Israel and the Jewish people. ... The United States puts its embassies in capital cities, and it's unjust and discriminatory to say we're going to single out Israel as the one country where we don't put our embassy [in the capital].\" \nWhen President Trump on Wednesday ordered the State Department to begin preparations to move the embassy to Jerusalem, several Jewish-American groups welcomed the move. \n\"By stating the truth of Jerusalem's status as the capital of the State of Israel, President Trump has asserted U.S. global leadership towards ending a longstanding, senseless anomaly,\" said David Harris, chief executive officer of the American Jewish Committee. \nThe Anti-Defamation League called the move a \"significant step,\" coming at a time \"when international organizations and other detractors delegitimize the Jewish state and deny any Jewish connection to the holy city.\" \nBut there were also misgivings from some Jewish-American groups. The Reform Jewish Movement, representing nearly 900 congregations, noted that it has long supported the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital but also believed that moving the U.S. Embassy there should happen only \"at the right time.\" Without a comprehensive peace plan, the movement said it cannot support the president's decision to move the embassy now. \nConservative evangelical Christian leaders had fewer qualms. \n\"This decision will be met by political praise and theological conviction,\" said Johnnie Moore, an informal spokesman for Trump's evangelical advisory group. \"Evangelicals in every corner of the United States will be ecstatic,\" he said. \nEvangelicals feel a special kinship with Jerusalem as the city where they believe Jesus Christ was crucified and rose again. Some sects even take an eschatological view, arguing that Jesus will return to earth in Jerusalem, once all Jews are reunited there. \nFor Trump's evangelical advisory group, said Moore, the only issue more important than the status of Jerusalem is the question of who will be appointed as federal judges. \n\"In our various meetings with the White House, this issue has always come up,\" Moore said, \"and it has always been an extended discussion around the table. I mean, at the heart of the relationship between the United States and Israel has been the friendship between evangelical Christians and the Jewish people.\" \nSome evangelical leaders who generally support the president's Jerusalem decision, however, fear the repercussions for their own Palestinian Christian followers. Muslim leaders in the Palestinian territories have warned there will be a reaction there to the president's announcement. The governments of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Turkey all expressed alarm at Trump's decision, as did Muslim leaders in the U.S. \n\"The reality is that Palestinians have existed for generations on the land of Palestine [and] in Jerusalem,\" said Osama Abuirshaid, a board member of the American Muslims for Palestine, at a press conference near the White House. \"[Trump] cannot deny this reality,\" Abuirshaid said. \"He spoke about the Jewish connection to Jerusalem while negating the Christian and Muslim connection to the land and to the holy city.\" \nPope Francis advised against \"adding new elements of tension in a world already shaken and scarred by many cruel conflicts.\" The heads of several Christian churches in Jerusalem, in a joint letter to Trump, said a unilateral change in the status of Jerusalem by the U.S. government \"will yield increased hatred, conflict, violence, and suffering in Jerusalem and the Holy Land ... [and] cause irreparable harm.\" \nA similar warning came from Elizabeth Eaton, the presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran group in the U.S. \n\"This announcement,\" Eaton said, \"has a high probability of leading to violence and bloodshed and not ... getting any closer to having the two parties come to the table again.\" \nEaton spoke following a meeting in Geneva with fellow Lutheran chuch leaders from around the world, including those in Jordan and other Arab countries.

\u00bb Luxury LA mansions threatened as fierce California wildfires rage Luxury LA mansions threatened as fierce California wildfires rage Latest Stories , Today's Breaking News \nLOS ANGELES: An inferno engulfed the Los Angeles region Wednesday, forcing more than 200,000 people to flee and threatening thousands of homes, including mansions in the luxurious Bel-Air neighborhood. \nAuthorities issued a \u201cpurple\u201d alert\u2014never used before\u2014because of the extreme danger including winds that could reach 80 miles an hour (128 kilometers an hour), severely limiting firefighting efforts. \n\u201cYesterday it was further north, but this morning we woke up and it was east of us,\u201d said Los Angeles resident Patricia Moore, 84, loading belongings into the trunk of her car. \n\u201cWe heard the fire engines before six o\u2019clock this morning, and we said, \u2018Maybe we should start getting our stuff into the car.'\u201d \nThe flames have swallowed about 80,000 acres (32,000 hectares) in just over a day since the \u201cThomas\u201d fire, currently the state\u2019s largest, broke out, leaving at least one dead in an area about 45 minutes from downtown LA. \nHigh winds caused another wave of wildfires to erupt overnight Tuesday, including one in Los Angeles\u2019 affluent Bel-Air neighborhood. \nThe area battled grid locked traffic as residents fled ash and smoke that churned over the smoldering hillside in the United States\u2019 second-largest city. \nFire crews worked to save luxury homes threatened by the flames. \nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said more than 230,000 people had been forced from their homes in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. \n\u201cVery strong winds\u201d blowing from the northeast to the southwest were causing the fire to balloon, he said, warning Angelenos to be ready to flee at a moment\u2019s notice. \nIn Bel-Air, that\u2019s exactly what they did. \nThe \u201cSkirball\u201d fire ignited before 5 a.m. (1300 GMT) and quickly grew to engulf about 150 acres around the district, home to celebrities and billionaires including SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and pop superstar Beyonce. \nPolice knocked on doors and used loudspeakers to make sure everybody left their mansions. \n\u201cThey told even us to leave,\u201d one of the officers said. \nAmong the last to go was Evan Kleib, a bearded photographer, locking his door. He packed his camera and his dogs a his vintage burgundy car and left the home where he has lived for several years, its fate uncertain. \nUS media reported that the Bel-Air Moraga Estate of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, which contains a vineyard, was threatened by the wildfire. \nThe singer Lionel Richie cancelled a concert to help his ex-wife flee the area, while comedian Chelsea Handler and designer Adrienne Maloof were among celebrities tweeting that they had to evacuate. \nForecasters predicted that winds could cause fires to spread further, threatening more upscale homes and the acclaimed Getty Center museum. \nThe \u201cSkirball\u201d fire\u2014near a cultural center of the same name\u2014also prompted authorities to close the 405 Freeway, a major commuting corridor. \nResidents of wealthy LA neighborhoods between Mulholland Drive to the north and Sunset Boulevard to the south were part of the evacuation zone. This slideshow requires JavaScript. \nFlames menacing art \nThe Getty arts institution\u2014home to masterpieces including those by Edouard Manet\u2014 was closed until at least Thursday. \nMuseum authorities tweeted that \u201cair filtration systems are protecting the galleries from smoke.\u201d \nThe prestigious University of California, Los Angeles is near the same area and also ended up evacuating, after students began the day wearing masks. \nDozens of schools were closed, as was Santa Monica College. \nJust north in Ventura County the \u201cThomas\u201d blaze continued out of control, after erupting in the hills of oak and scrub north of Santa Paula, powered by strong seasonal guests known as Santa Ana winds. \nAt least 4,000 firefighters were deployed across the entire fire zone, including on the scene of the \u201cRye\u201d blaze\u2014which had grown to 7,000 acres in the Santa Clarita area \u2014 as well as the \u201cCreek\u201d fire north of downtown Los Angeles that had grown to more than 11,000 acres. \nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency over the area on Tuesday. \nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said it had released funds for relief services. \nUS President Donald Trump tweeted a message of \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to California as it nears the end of its deadliest year ever for wildfires.

JOHNSON THE ASSOCIATED PRESS   3:51 a.m. \nCHICAGO -- Modern birth-control pills that are lower in estrogen have fewer side effects than past oral contraceptives. But a Danish study suggests that, like older pills, they still modestly raise the risk of breast cancer, especially with long-term use. \nResearchers found a similar breast cancer risk with the progestin-only intrauterine device, and they couldn't rule out a risk for other hormonal contraceptives such as the patch and the implant. \nBut the overall increased risk was small, amounting to one extra case of breast cancer per year among 7,700 women using such contraceptives. Experts who reviewed the research said women should balance the news against known benefits of the pill -- including lowering the risk of other cancers. \n\"Hormonal contraception should still be perceived as a safe and effective option for family planning,\" said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital, who was not involved in the research. \nWomen in their 40s may want to consider nonhormonal IUDs, getting their tubes tied or talking with their partners about vasectomy, Manson said. \nStudies of older birth-control pills have shown \"a net cancer benefit\" because of lowered risk of cancer of the colon, uterus and ovaries despite a raised breast cancer risk, said Mia Gaudet, a breast cancer epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society. \nThere was optimism that newer, low-dose contraceptives would lower the breast cancer risk, but these results have dashed those hopes, said Gaudet, who wasn't involved in the research. \nAbout 140 million women use some type of hormonal contraception, including about 16 million in the United States. \nResearchers analyzed health records of 1.8 million women, ages 15 to 49, in Denmark where a national health care system allows linking up large databases of prescription histories, cancer diagnoses and other information. \nResults were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine . Novo Nordisk Foundation funded the research, but played no role in designing the study. The foundation has ties to the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, which primarily makes diabetes drugs and does not make contraceptives. \nCurrent and recent use of hormonal contraceptives was associated with a 20 percent increased risk of breast cancer. Risk increased with longer use, from a 9 percent increase in risk with less than a year of contraceptive use to a 38 percent increase after more than 10 years of use. \nDigging further, the researchers found no differences among types of birth-control pills. Because of fewer users, the results for the patch, vaginal ring, implant and progestin shot were less clear, but the analysis didn't rule out an increased breast cancer risk for those methods. \n\"No type of hormone contraceptive is risk-free, unfortunately,\" said lead author Lina Morch of Copenhagen University Hospital. \nResearchers accounted for education, childbirth and family history of breast cancer, but they weren't able to adjust for several other known cancer risk factors such as alcohol use and limited physical activity, or protective factors such as breast-feeding. \nWomen with a family history of breast cancer may want to ask their doctors about other contraceptives, said Dr. Roshni Rao, a breast surgeon at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. \n\"Oral contraceptives are like any other medication,\" Rao said. \"There are risks and there are benefits.

Kirsten Gillibrand (left), D-N.Y.,speaks at a news conference on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, where she and other members of Congress introduced legislation to curb sexual harassment in the workplace. \nWASHINGTON -- More than half the Senate's Democrats, including the Democratic leader, Charles Schumer of New York, called for Sen. Al Franken to resign Wednesday, after a sixth woman came forward to charge that the Minnesota Democrat had made an improper advance on her. \n\"Sen. Franken should resign,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"I consider Sen. Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately.\" \nFranken scheduled an announcement today on his future in the Senate, and Minnesota Public Radio reported that he would be leaving. \"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \nGillibrand was joined by Sens. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Patty Murray of Washington, Kamala Harris of California, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Maria Cantwell of Washington, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, who issued statements in a coordinated effort. \nSen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, added his voice, as did Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, and Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. \n\"It's time for him to resign,\" Durbin said. \"It just seemed that the credible charges continued. I thought it might be an isolated incident or two. It seems to be that there was a pattern of conduct.\" \nGillibrand started the avalanche with an extended statement on Facebook. \n\"As elected officials, we should be held to the highest standards -- not the lowest,\" Gillibrand wrote on Facebook. \"The allegations against Sen. Franken describe behavior that cannot be tolerated. While he's entitled to an Ethics Committee hearing, I believe he should step aside to let someone else serve.\" \nFranken has apologized for his behavior, but the senators said his admissions are not enough. \n\"I have been shocked and disappointed to learn over the last few weeks that a colleague I am fond of personally has engaged in behavior toward women that is unacceptable,\" Gillibrand said. \"I consider Sen. Franken to be a friend and have enjoyed working with him in the Senate in our shared fight to help American families. But this moment of reckoning about our friends and colleagues who have been accused of sexual misconduct is necessary, and it is painful. We must not lose sight that this watershed moment is bigger than any one industry, any one party, or any one person.\" \nThat was followed in rapid succession by other statements. Hirono said the effort was indeed coordinated. \n\"We have been in touch with each other,\" she said. \"It's been difficult because I consider Al a friend. I've sat with him in two committees, but that doesn't excuse his behavior.\" \nHirono added: \"We're at the point where I think that there can be a cultural change in terms of how women are perceived and treated in this country. This kind of bad behavior has been tolerated and ignored for far too long, but not today.\" \nThe Democrats' move in the Senate came after House Democrats had showed a similarly uncompromising stand against accused party members in that body. \nRep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., the longest-serving black House member in history, left Congress on Tuesday after Democratic leaders and rank-and-file members called for his resignation amid multiplying accusations of sexual harassment. \nAnd freshman Rep. Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., has faced calls for his resignation since accusations emerged Friday that he had repeatedly propositioned his former campaign finance director. \nRepublicans have largely remained quiet since it emerged Friday that Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, used $84,000 from a secret taxpayer fund to settle a lurid sexual harassment case filed against him. \nAnd Republicans have been divided over the party's Senate candidate in Alabama, Roy Moore, who has been accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. The special election for the Senate seat once held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions is set for Tuesday. \nA Section on 12/07/2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yamiche alcindor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harnik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirsten gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "debbie stabenow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tammy baldwin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hirono", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sherrod brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick leahy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruben kihuen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kamala harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heidi heitkamp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blake farenthold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tammy duckworth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john conyers jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom perez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gillibrand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claire mccaskill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edward markey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "durbin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patty murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard durbin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maggie hassan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria cantwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob casey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mazie hirono", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe donnelly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ork times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic national committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota public radio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vermont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-mich.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "r-texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-nev.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hampshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north dakota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:51.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f33c159b280674af691726a0f1aea323046dd44c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtgAfystKtSimjghVFIhWmv7UaKr3InhrR6uB_BEt39buKkjqs_LoybZP260U0jcSag--", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/seminole-hoops-talk.42/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Seminole Hoops Talk | Warchant.com", "title": "LIVE On-site Updates -

So I quickly walk over to the area where the food was been made and told the manager that the order was wrong. She assured me the issue would be taken care of. I gave the manager the receipt and explained to her we wanted 2 sandwiches and 2 soups. Not 3 sandwiches and 1 soup. I walked back to where we were sitting and when the food was brought over my mom got her soup and a big bowl of her soup. My order was fine. Nothing was said when are food was brought over, like \"I'm sorry for the mistake or we did such and such to make it right\" So when my mom and I were done eating, we walked over to the counter and asked if we could have the receipt with and the difference that was owed us because of the mess up. I honestly didn't understand her math, but she said she only owed me $0.44 and I asked \"How is that possible when you charged me for 3 sandwiches and 1 soup???\" She then said \"Well I gave you a bowl of the soup so that should have been fine\" and I said, \"But I didn't ask you to do that\" so then she did another calculation and said hesitating, \"Alright, I owe you $1.53.\" My mom and I walked away puzzled because if she would have recalculating the whole order I wouldn't have paid $30.80 for my meal.

countries, the companies said on Wednesday.The news came a day after Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google said it would block its YouTube video streaming application from two of Amazon\u2019s devices and criticized the online retailer for not selling Google hardware.Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook had said in June that Amazon\u2019s streaming service would be available on Apple devices later this year.Apple TV, a device for watching movies and television over the internet, will also start featuring live sports from its own Apple TV app this week, Apple said in a blogpost on Wednesday.While live sports were previously available on Apple TV in apps from ESPN and the National Basketball Association, the new additions to Apple\u2019s own app enable features like sending alerts to connected

Credit: AP/Time Magazine This Person of the Year edition of Time magazine features \u201cThe Silence Breakers,\u201d those who have shared their stories about sexual assault and harassment. \nNEW YORK -- The \"silence breakers\" -- those who have shared their stories about sexual assault and harassment -- have been named Time magazine's person of the year. \nNumerous women have spoken out publicly since October about sexual misconduct by dozens of high-profile men in the entertainment, media, business and sports industries. Time praised those who have given \"voice to open secrets, for moving whisper networks onto social networks, for pushing us all to stop accepting the unacceptable.\" The magazine's cover features Ashley Judd, Taylor Swift, Susan Fowler and others who say they have been harassed. \nTime 's announcement was made Wednesday on NBC's Today show, from which longtime host Matt Lauer was fired last week amid harassment allegations. Today host Savannah Guthrie acknowledged Wednesday that this year's winner hits \"close to home\" and mentioned Lauer by name. \n\"The galvanizing actions of the women on our cover ... along with those of hundreds of others, and of many men as well, have unleashed one of the highest-velocity shifts in our culture since the 1960s,\" Time 's editor in chief, Edward Felsenthal, said on Today . \nWomen who spoke out, initially against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and then others, helped to spawn the #MeToo social media movement, with millions of people telling stories of sexual misconduct. \nThe tweets and Instagram and Facebook posts began after actress-activist Alyssa Milano followed a suggestion from a friend of a friend on Facebook and tweeted: \"If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet.\" The hashtag was tweeted nearly a million times in 48 hours. #MeToo was actually founded by activist Tarana Burke a decade ago to raise awareness about sexual violence. Milano has said she wasn't aware of Burke's contributions when she made her initial tweet and has since publicly credited her. \nMilano and Burke appeared together Wednesday on the Today show. \n\"This is just the start. I've been saying from the beginning it's not just a moment, it's a movement,\" Burke said. \"Now the work really begins.\" \nThe media's endless stream of sexual harassment investigations and the countless #MeToo accounts of harassment, sexual abuse and worse have ensnared an ever-growing list of public figures. \nThose include TV journalists Lauer, Charlie Rose, Mark Halperin; former NPR news chief Michael Oreskes; entertainers Russell Simmons, Louis C.K., Kevin Spacey, James Levine and Garrison Keillor; and U.S. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., and U.S. Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, Time 's 2015 person of the year, said through a spokesman that this year's winners should be thanked for \"having the courage to break the silence on sexual assaults and for the worldwide discussion that they have launched.\" \nThe two runners-up for Person of the Year were Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump, himself accused of sexual misconduct by numerous women. He has denied any wrongdoing. \nTrump, Person of the Year in 2016, tweeted recently that the magazine had told him he \"probably\" would be named again if he agreed to an interview and photo shoot. Trump added that he \"took a pass.\" Time has disputed his account. \nOn Wednesday, the president of Minnesota Public Radio told employees that the decision to cut business ties with Keillor, the former A Prairie Home Companion host, resulted from \"multiple allegations\" that covered an extended period of time. \nJon McTaggart held an off-the-record meeting with employees Wednesday, a week after Keillor's dismissal was announced. Reporters from Minnesota Public Radio News did not attend because the meeting was declared off-the-record, but they compiled an account from employees who did attend. \nInformation for this article was contributed by staff members of The Associated Press and by Lindsey Bever and Abby Ohlheiser of The Washington Post. \nA Section on 12/07/2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "taylor swift", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark halperin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin spacey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edward felsenthal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tarana burke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russell simmons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garrison keillor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashley judd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john conyers jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james levine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keillor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt lauer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie rose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon mctaggart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xi jinping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angela merkel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael oreskes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louis c.k.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "savannah guthrie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abby ohlheiser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lauer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susan fowler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al franken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alyssa milano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lindsey bever", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "npr news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota public radio news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota public radio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-minn.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:52.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f33c159b280674af691726a0f1aea323046dd44c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtgAfystKtSimjghVFIhWmv7UaKr3InhrR6uB_BEt39buKkjqs_LoybZP260U0jcSag--", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/seminole-hoops-talk.42/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Seminole Hoops Talk | Warchant.com", "title": "LIVE On-site Updates -

Federal judges in two states had blocked the administration from fully implementing the measure until the Supreme Court intervened this week. \nThe Supreme Court, which has yet to decide the case on the merits, indicated that it expected the appeals court to \"render its decision with appropriate dispatch.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit is also weighing a separate challenge to the ban, and oral arguments are scheduled in that case for Friday. \nThe 9th Circuit had ruled against a previous version of Trump's travel ban, though from their questions Wednesday, it was not obvious that they were leaning toward doing so again. Hawkins said of the latest ban: \"This is a little bit different, isn't it?\" and pointed to the government's process to develop it. Paez asked at one point if the court was \"too demanding\" of the government in its opinion on a prior version of the ban. \nGould said the judges \"will try to get an opinion out as soon as practical.\" \nA Section on 12/07/2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt zapotosky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neal katyal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard paez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hashim mooppan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill clinton-appointed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gould", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronald gould", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael daly hawkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "4th circuit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. court of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "9th circuit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "somalia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:53.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f33c159b280674af691726a0f1aea323046dd44c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtgAfystKtSimjghVFIhWmv7UaKr3InhrR6uB_BEt39buKkjqs_LoybZP260U0jcSag--", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/seminole-hoops-talk.42/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Seminole Hoops Talk | Warchant.com", "title": "LIVE On-site Updates -

Thursday 07 December 2017 \nBEAR Scotland\u2019s resources are prepared to assist in dealing with the \u201cStorm Caroline\u201d conditions with winds of up to 90mph forecast. \nAn amber \u2018be prepared\u2019 weather warning has been issued for high winds across the Grampian and Highlands and Eilean Siar areas by the Met Office valid from 6am on Thursday morning until midnight. \nIn addition to Thursday\u2019s amber wind warning, a yellow warning will follow from midnight for snow and ice until 6pm on Saturday. \nResources across the North West and North East units are on standby including over 100 operatives equipped to deal with issues on the trunk roads brought by the high winds, with four gully tankers as well as sandbags and water pumps available to deal with any flooding issues. \nTeams will work around the clock to maintain the routes and conditions across the network will be monitored 24/7 by BEAR\u2019s control room. \nAs Storm Caroline will bring colder temperatures, BEAR\u2019s winter teams will be responding by carrying out precautionary salt treatments across all trunk roads in the north east and north west of Scotland, followed by all routes being patrolled to clear any snow. \nBEAR Scotland is working closely with Police Scotland and Transport Scotland to respond to tomorrow\u2019s high winds across the North West and North East, followed by the ice and snow that is forecast to continue until Saturday. \nEddie Ross of BEAR Scotland said: \u201cAt present we are preparing for the forthcoming high winds and our teams are on standby to assist in whatever way possible to keep road users safe and moving. \n\u201cIn addition to our normal emergency response specialist landscaping teams will be positioned across the north of Scotland tomorrow to deal with any trees or branches that may fall on to trunk roads. \n\u201cWe\u2019re also gearing up for the forthcoming drop in temperatures and forecast snow, with our fleet of gritters and other winter vehicles ready to tackle any adverse weather conditions. \n\u201cWe would advise motorists to be alert and prepare in advance for the adverse weather by checking travel information via the Traffic Scotland website, twitter or mobile site as well as local radio before setting off, allowing extra time for journeys and making sure to drive to conditions.\u201d \nTransport Scotland\u2019s online \u2018trunk road gritter tracker\u2019, launched last winter, provides live tracking of gritters on the trunk road network. The tracker can be accessed through the Traffic Scotland website at www.trafficscotland.org/wintergritterinfo .

SCOTT APPLEWHITE In this photo from Wednesday, Nov. 29, 2017, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, arrives for a Democratic Caucus meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington. \nWASHINGTON -- The House overwhelmingly voted Wednesday to kill a resolution from a liberal Democratic lawmaker to impeach President Donald Trump, with most Democrats joined Republicans in opposing the move. \nRep. Al Green, D-Texas, said Trump had associated his presidency with causes rooted in bigotry and racism. To back his claim accusing Trump of high misdemeanors, Green cited incidents such as Trump's blaming both sides for violence at a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., and his recent sharing of hateful, anti-Muslim videos posted online by a fringe British extremist group. \nAfter his resolution was read aloud, the House voted 364-58 to table the resolution. \nAll the no votes came from Democrats, and four Democratic lawmakers voted present. In all, 126 Democrats joined Republicans in voting to table Green's effort in the GOP-led House. \n[ PRESIDENT TRUMP: Timeline, appointments, executive orders + guide to actions in first 200 days ] \nArkansas' four House members, all Republicans, voted to table the resolution. \nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said in a statement shortly before the vote that while \"legitimate questions have been raised about his fitness to lead this nation,\" they argued \"now is not the time to consider articles of impeachment.\" \nSeveral Democratic lawmakers said they agreed that it's premature to act before special counsel Robert Mueller's team completes its investigation into Russian election meddling. \nRep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., said Democratic lawmakers cannot allow themselves to be drawn into a process \"that's not thoughtful or complete or might not even be the conclusion we ought to draw.\" \n\"We ought to let Mr. Mueller complete his full investigation rather than engage in what would essentially be a public relations stunt,\" Kildee said. \"This is a serious thing. It ought not to be done on a whim.\" \nGreen said on the House floor that he planned to take the road less traveled in seeking Trump's impeachment. He's convinced it's a road worth traveling, he said, but \"I ask that no one take this journey with me.\" \nAfterward, Green said the vote would not deter him from trying again. He said he was already working on additional articles of impeachment. \n\"I didn't lobby anybody. I didn't ask anybody, but I'm grateful for those who did vote with the Constitution. I assure you, it's a process and this was a step in the process,\" Green said. \nPelosi has said any impeachment drive should wait until there's evidence of an impeachable offense. Another problem for Democrats is that opposing Green's resolution puts them at risk of angering the party's rabidly anti-Trump voters. Some Democrats tried talking Green out of his plan.

This would focus on trade and a two-year transition deal to smooth the departure after March 2019. But the timetable has been thrown into doubt after discussions broke down in Brussels on Monday.Senior executives in the financial services sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, told Reuters May's efforts to secure a transition deal had come too late and they had no choice but to start restructuring.Big supermarkets such as Tesco and Sainsbury's have been working with suppliers to identify potential delays, shortages or price rises. They have lined up alternative providers, according to suppliers and sources in the industry.The uncertainty is particularly painful for the manufacturing sector as low margins make it risky for them to restructure unless it is essential. They have been holding off on investment but are preparing for new certification that would allow them to sell in Europe if there is no deal.\"The delay is so great and the uncertainty is so great that companies have no choice but to start triggering their plans,\" the head of one of Britain's largest companies said.Britain and the EU are working to get talks back on track this week but the chairman of one large international bank said its executives had decided to plan for the worst at a conference call on Tuesday.\"The question is no longer whether we are moving (operations to the EU), it is a question of how big those moves are?,\" he said.Like other executives, he had been asked by his board and the government not to divulge their thinking.FRUIT AND BEEFThe chairman said the bank has started discussions with customers about rerouting client activity to European hubs, including rewriting thousands of contracts.Senior employees were told last month if they had to relocate to Europe, he said.Another senior executive at a large U.S. bank said that he was increasingly concerned that May's government could collapse after the Brussels talks broke down over a dispute about the Irish border, adding to the uncertainty.\"We are at the maximum point of danger,\" he said.The financial sector needs extra time to make sure its clients are prepared. For instance, a British bank opening a subsidiary in Europe may need its clients to adopt a new sort code throughout their own supply chains.In other sectors, companies are making smaller changes that would enable them to operate in Europe after Brexit, from preparing compliance changes to drawing up shadow supply chains and looking for additional warehouse space.Food retailers are lining up alternative suppliers in Britain or outside the EU in case delays at borders or new tariffs disrupt deliveries. Around 30 percent of Britain's food and drink comes from the EU.Some changes would need to be made early next year in time for the 2019 departure. Changing a fresh fruit supplier could require a lead time of a year, depending on the growing cycle.Ali Capper, a partner in Stocks Farm in Worcestershire, central England, and a chair of the Horticulture and Potatoes Board at the National Farmers Union, said there were signs retail customers were requesting more British produce.Ireland provides almost 70 percent of UK beef imports, or 270,000 tonnes a year. Were tariffs or border delays to make Irish beef less competitive, supermarkets could look further afield, for instance to Argentina.MANUFACTURING PRESSUREMany manufacturers are unwilling to sign off on new plans until they know how Britain will trade in the future.The drugs sector has been among the first to move so they can comply with EU regulations. GSK and AstraZeneca have already set up new facilities in mainland Europe to test batches of drugs made in Britain.Autos and aerospace firms are focusing on certification. According to the aerospace and defence trade body, ADS, some companies are considering applying to the European Aviation Safety Agency for a status that would enable them to sell in the EU if Britain was no longer a member state.Japanese carmaker Honda, which builds around 8 percent of British cars at its plant in Swindon, is considering increasing its warehouse capacity in Britain and stock levels to counter any new border delays.Manufacturers reluctance to sign off on big plans has had a knock on effect on companies in the supply chain.\"The biggest impact we see is a general unwillingness to make investment and capacity decisions as result of the continued uncertainty,\" said Stephen Cheetham, owner of PK Engineering Ltd of Hereford, a supplier of components to the aerospace and scientific industries.\"We would expect continued paralysis and short-termism until a trade deal is finalised,\" he told Reuters.Having a transition deal will allow businesses to survive the two years after Brexit by allowing them to defer any big decisions until the final parameters of Brexit are worked out, said Andrew Bonfield, finance director of National Grid and chairman of the 100 Group of finance chiefs.\"It's about the avoidance of a cliff edge,\" he said. \u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2017 All rights reserved.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew bonfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen cheetham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tesco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national grid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european aviation safety agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "horticulture and potatoes board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sainsbury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national farmers union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pk engineering ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomson reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stocks farm in worcestershire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "astrazeneca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gsk", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hereford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swindon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:55.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f33c159b280674af691726a0f1aea323046dd44c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtgAfystKtSimjghVFIhWmv7UaKr3InhrR6uB_BEt39buKkjqs_LoybZP260U0jcSag--", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/seminole-hoops-talk.42/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Seminole Hoops Talk | Warchant.com", "title": "LIVE On-site Updates - Florida State vs. Loyola (Maryland)", "title_full": "LIVE On-site Updates - Florida State vs. Loyola (Maryland) | Warchant.com", "published": "2017-12-06T16:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 31, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.32, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3057, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ff596ff85835691a611c5b5c2d291c49d39cbb09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtgAfystKtSimjghVFIhWmv7UaKr3InhrR6uB_BEt39buKkjqs_LoybZcHCzpGzidFsjp62G2MQNe", "ord_in_thread": 23, "author": "Thirtyeight2thirtyfour", "published": "2017-12-06T16:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:55.002+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15093720, "moreResultsAvailable": 15093620, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512641095002&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 267}
