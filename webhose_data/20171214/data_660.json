It's clean. . . . It is a deterrent.\"\nVincent's comments came during a week in which the NFL issued three suspensions, one of which was overturned on appeal, for on-field behavior by players during games. New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster were suspended for one game apiece. Cincinnati Bengals safety George Iloka 's one-game suspension was reduced to a fine on appeal.\nBefore this season, the competition committee issued a directive that a player should be ejected from a game by officials or suspended by the league for the most egregious and flagrant illegal hits, even for a first offense by that player. Officials have remained reluctant to eject players. But there have been nine suspensions handed out by the league, according to Vincent.\n\"I think it's working. . . . [For] things that shouldn't be part of our game, players are being removed,\" Vincent said Wednesday.\nCompetition committee members have said in the past that they were hesitant to move to a college-like targeting rule because they have been reluctant to subject judgment calls by the game officials to replay review. That will be debated again during the upcoming offseason.\n\"It's something that we will consider. . . . It is on our agenda to be discussed beginning in February,\" Vincent said.\n ESPN's Mike Greenberg clears the air on 'Mike & Mike' breakup As NFL Rob Gronkowski George Iloka Pittsburgh Steelers Cincinnati Bengals New England Patriots", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "george iloka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "troy vincent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vincent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob gronkowski", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sports nfl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cincinnati bengals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittsburgh steelers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:55.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "890c1b40029b52ca24179f3298f7d4ff323f3249", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW1xf7ieD78V08ldQuj73MdRiG64.GxqzYocTIa7Ck2S_wQwY64F6iyTlbcev3y.LzP_Hhlo2ZGtA--", "site_full": "news.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/news?query=a&start=22&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "", "title": "Greece Turkey Erdogan", "title_full": "Greece Turkey Erdogan : \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ub274\uc2a4", "published": "2017-12-07T11:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "KS", "spam_score": 0.029, "main_image": "http://imgnews.naver.net/image/origin/077/2017/12/07/3984547.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "890c1b40029b52ca24179f3298f7d4ff323f3249", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW1xf7ieD78V08ldQuj73MdRiG64.GxqzYocTIa7Ck2S_wQwY64F6iyTlbcev3y.LzP_Hhlo2ZGtA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "AP\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4 | \ub124\uc774\ubc84 \ub274\uc2a4", "published": "2017-12-07T11:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "Greece Turkey Erdogan", "text": "A worker cleans the red carpet as Greek Presidential Guards march to their positions for the official welcome ceremony for Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in Athens, Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017.

Updated: Thursday,   \nBy ANDREW TAYLORAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Minnesota Democrat Al Franken, facing fresh allegations of sexual misconduct and vanishing support from fellow Democrats, appears to be on the brink of resigning from the Senate. \nFranken scheduled an announcement for Thursday, though his office tweeted Wednesday evening that he had not made \"a final decision\" on resigning. \nBut a majority of the Senate's Democrats called on the two-term lawmaker to quit after a woman emerged Wednesday morning saying he forcibly tried to kiss her in 2006. Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight. \nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign. \n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\" \nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed. \n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\" \nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\" \nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice. \n\"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said. \nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006. \nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\" \nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\" \nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable. \nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\" \nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker. \nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe. \nA national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" - women who have come forward on sexual harassment. \nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations. \nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them. \nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan. \nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010.

Air ambulance services refer to transport or evacuation facilities provided to patients in emergency situations at the accident site, home, or hospital. Air ambulances are equipped with advanced medical facilities, including devices used in emergencies, to provide immediate medical carei to the patient until he/she reaches the nearest hospital. Moreover, air ambulances have trained medical crew onboard to treat patients in emergency situations en route to the hospital. Air ambulance efficiently addresses the issue of long travel time and inadequate reach to remote areas faced in road ambulance service. Air ambulance services have thus become an essential component of the modern healthcare system. \n\nRequest a sample copy of this report: https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/request-sample/6 \nIncreasing use of Helicopters in Air Ambulance \n\nThe global air ambulance services market outlook can be analyzed on the basis of type of aircraft as follows: \nHelicopter \nAircraft/Airplane \nRotary winged aircraft \nFixed winged aircraft \nSea-Planes \nUse of helicopters in air ambulance is increasing owing to its convenience in landing and taking-off from a smaller ground area. Moreover, helicopter enables wider reach in remote areas compared to winged aircrafts/airplanes, which require more space for landing and take-off. Companies are also making use of sea planes and corporate planes depending on the demand and patient location. \n\nLack of Infrastructure and Inadequate Number of Aircraft in Developing Regions are Key Challenges for Growth of Air Ambulance Market \n\nOn the basis of geography, the global air ambulance services market scenario can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Rest of the World. Developed infrastructure, defined regulatory framework and favorable reimbursement policies are some of the factors contributing to the dominance of the air ambulance services market in North America and Europe. Developing countries of Asia Pacific, Latina America and Middle East are expected to show swift growth in the demand for air ambulance services. Factors such as rapidly growing medical tourism, improving medical infrastructure, and increasing disposable income are projected to boost growth of air ambulance services market in these regions. Air ambulance service providers in India such as Aviators Air Rescue, Aeromed, Innovation Aviation Pvt Ltd, JetSetGo, Air Ambulance Aviation, and Medanta\u2019s Flying Doctors are collaborating with insurance providers to make the service affordable to all. However, lack of infrastructure and inadequate number of aircraft is deterring operators to meet demand for air ambulance in the country. \n\nAsk for customization: https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/request-customization/6 \n\nFaster Reach and Onboard Assistance Driving Demand \n\nSome key global air ambulance services market drivers include its ability to faster reach compared to road ambulance and onboard medical assistance. Also, air ambulance services are widely utilized on the warfront to rescue injured soldiers and provide emergency medical care to them. \n\nFavorable reimbursement policies for air ambulance services are propelling demand for air ambulance services among patients. Certain insurance providers in Canada reimburse around 80% of the total service cost of air ambulance. This reimbursement policy is applicable for patients who require immediate hospitalization. This policy, however, excludes non-emergency patients, thus increasing cost of this service for such patients. This is a major air ambulance services market restraint. Formulation of strict safety rules by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is one of the factors anticipated to reduce profit margins of air ambulance service providers, which would also hinder the growth of air ambulance services market revenue during the forecast period (2016\u20132024). \n\nAmbulance Drones: A Fast Emerging Possible Nemesis \n\nAir ambulance service is a capital intensive business, which increases entry barriers for new entrants in the market. Moreover, the advent of ambulance drones will also impact demand for air ambulance in future. The high cost of availing the air ambulance service in comparison to a cheaper ambulance drone would be restrain market growth of air ambulance to a major extent. \n\nClick here to know more about this report: https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/ongoing-insight/air-ambulance-services-market-6 \n\nIn terms of number of players, there are various small players operating with a small fleet of planes across the globe.

Greenblatt also produced exceptional returns as managing partner at Gotham Capital, a New York City-based hedge fund he founded. The firm averaged a remarkable 40 percent annualized return over more than two decades.\nAbout Validea : Validea is an investment research service that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street to attend the weekly session of Prime Ministers Questions in Parliament in London, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. \nLONDON (AP) - Ireland's government expects Britain to make a new proposal on Brexit by Friday as officials in London struggle to resolve issues surrounding the Irish border that are stalling talks with the European Union. \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May is under pressure to persuade EU leaders who meet next week to declare that sufficient progress has been made on divorce issues, such as the Irish border, so that trade talks can begin. Business leaders warn further delays will cause trouble for companies as they plan for the future. \nIreland's prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said Wednesday he hopes May will submit a new formal written offer \"tonight or tomorrow.\" \nDisagreements about how to treat the border between the Republic of Ireland and the U.K. province of Northern Ireland derailed an earlier proposal.

I also purchased 300 win. mag this BLR shoots 5/8-3/4 inch groups at 100 yards off a bench , this rifle does have recoil too,gun shoots with this 130 grain barnes x bullet 3400 fps but I did not use this lever rifle this fall. I am waiting for some one to make a picatinny base for a BLR long action and short action too so I can mount a niteforce scope on this 300 win mag,this size lever 300 win mag will have 500 yard capability maybe farther with a bi-pod ? the Browning BLR has been made for many years I just have overlooked this powerful /accurate lever,but glad this lever is still made today ! I also wished Browning made a couple more different cartridges like a 6.5 x 284 and a 338 win. mag and have 24 inch barrels on both, I will recommend this that Browning do this at the dealer show this winter. so don`t give up on levers these BLR`s do shoot well and have long range capability with these hi-power cartridges !\nLast edited by pete53; Yesterday at 09:01 AM .

Sinopec alleges it never received full payment for 45,000 tons of steel rebar it agreed to sell PDVSA for $43 million and which was delivered in 2013. \nThe lawsuit, while small in size, says PDVSA through its U.S. subsidiary Bariven reneged on repeated promises to pay Sinopec, at one point costing the Chinese company $2 million in losses after it entered into arbitration with a supplier it agreed to purchase the steel from to carry out the deal. \n\"This is not simply a case of a broken promise to pay,\" Sinopec said in the court documents, accusing PDVSA of \"deceit\" and \"willful deception\" in its refusal to pay its bills. \"Rather, this case involves a complex commercial transaction specifically calculated to leave Sinopec without a remedy.\" \nThe Chinese \"usually take a more diplomatic tone\" and are clearly angry, Russ Dallen, head of local brokerage Caracas Capital, wrote in a report Wednesday in which he revealed the existence of the lawsuit. \nThe dispute comes as Venezuela is seeking fresh financing to restructure its huge foreign debt on which it is behind payment. \nChina has been one of Venezuela's biggest creditors, providing it loans, cash and investment totaling more than $65 billion between 2007 and 2016, according to a database maintained by Boston University and the Inter-American Dialogue. But it has so far failed to come to President Nicolas Maduro's rescue as he tries to shield the OPEC nation from triple-digit inflation, fast-declining oil production and financial sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. \nA spokesman for Beijing-based Sinopec Group confirmed that a U.S. subsidiary of a Sinopec trading company had launched a lawsuit against PDVSA about \"a dispute over payment owed.\" \n\"As a big company, it is normal for us to have such commercial dispute and it is normal to resort to law if there is a dispute,\" Sinopec spokesman Lu Dapeng said by phone. \nGeng Shuang, a spokesman of China's Foreign Ministry, said the issue was nothing more than a regular commercial dispute and that China remains willing to cooperate with Venezuela on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. \n\"I think this is a common commercial dispute and there is no need to make over-interpretations of it,\" Geng said. \"I want to stress that China attaches great importance to the development of China Venezuela relations.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press researchers Yu Bing and Shanshan Wang in Beijing contributed to this report.

He said: \"Many people still think we only represent a parish, something to do with a church, but are confused because there are three different church parishes in Ilkley.\" \nAfter contributions from other councillors the resolution was carried with all councillors present voting in favour except for one abstention. \nThere is little practical difference between a Town and Parish Council except that Town Councils appoint a Town Mayor to chair their meetings and lead the Council generally, as well as a Deputy Mayor. Cllr Butler told the Gazette: \"It is a question of perception - the perception of how we are seen by other organisations and government bodies and of how we see ourselves.\" \nAt the meeting the Parish Council paid tribute to the volunteers in Ilkley who contribute to the brilliant arts scene in town. There were many invited guests from the arts world as well as the Lord Mayor of Bradford, Cllr Abid Hussain, and Deputy Lieutenant Roger Whitaker. Among the groups in attendance were the Upstagers, The Ilkley Playhouse, Ilkley Camera Club, Ilkley Arts and Ilkley Choral Society. Cllr Butler said: \"None of these organisations could function without the large number of amateur groups and organisations which run them and make use of them, all run by hard working volunteers.\" \nAfter the meeting guests were treated to a showcase of Ilkley Arts. There was a short performance by the Two Rivers Wind Quartet; dramatic Christmas Readings from Andrew Leggott and Geraldine Woodhouse; an exhibition by Ilkley Camera Club, and a flower arrangement created by Annette Ackroyd of Ilkley Flower Club, all of which were followed by a beautiful rendition of two flamenco pieces by local guitarist Samuel Moore. \nAfter the entertainment guests enjoyed food and drink in the annual celebration of the Christmas season given by the Parish, soon to be Town, Council.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cllr butler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger whitaker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cllr steve butler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "annette ackroyd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew leggott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cllr mark stidworthy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cllr abid hussain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geraldine woodhouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samuel moore", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "town council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilkley parish council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilkley playhouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parish council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilkley arts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "town and parish council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilkley choral society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilkley parish council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilkley camera club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilkley flower club", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ilkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bradford", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:03:59.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f129dddda5f8f40253be769249662de1bafe0b27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90VPk9GVr.DYn_RiJDJxGQCYLyLhpXUJy06kZWJvOhMHDgyDmNh2pBqKF1Jn5Pu8ZDvoqPlyq4uiHmlHrV1kOFysLmySyim9SbN5X_nnHPk5yskNIndzQF1aykXUFcjUFjuQ9RmVwpGA--", "site_full": "www.ilkleygazette.co.uk", "site": "ilkleygazette.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.ilkleygazette.co.uk/news/rss/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Ilkley Gazette | News", "title": "Inspirational man dies aged 40 after 14 year battle with cancer", "title_full": "Inspirational man dies aged 40 after 14 year battle with cancer", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.ilkleygazette.co.uk/resources/images/7151605/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f129dddda5f8f40253be769249662de1bafe0b27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90VPk9GVr.DYn_RiJDJxGQCYLyLhpXUJy06kZWJvOhMHDgyDmNh2pBqKF1Jn5Pu8ZDvoqPlyq4uiHmlHrV1kOFysLmySyim9SbN5X_nnHPk5yskNIndzQF1aykXUFcjUFjuQ9RmVwpGA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "Inspirational man dies aged 40 after 14 year battle with cancer", "text": "0 comments \nAN inspirational man who became a local hero after raising thousands of pounds for Macmillan Cancer Support whilst battling the disease himself, has died aged 40. \nMark Nixon, who attended St Mary's, Menston, from the age of 11 and returned there to work as a teaching assistant in 2015, died on November 26 after a 14 year battle with cancer. \nHe was diagnosed with testicular cancer aged 26 which was so advanced he had a very poor prognosis. It was the beginning of a very brave and courageous battle with cancer. His mother Julia Nixon, of Baildon, said: \"He almost died a week after being a patient at St James Hospital. It was a devastating situation for himself, his family and friends. He had nine cycles of chemotherapy and over the next 11 years had eight major operations which took place at St James\u2019s Hospital, Leeds, The Royal Marsden Hospital, London and The Royal Brompton Hospital, London.\" \nMark told his mum at the time \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I have to live, so I have to live my life\u201d and in between operations Mark, travelled to countries including Australia for the Rugby World Cup, Russia, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Mexico, Thailand the US and many others. \nIn 2009, aged 32, and living in Rawdon, he succeeded in his bid to reach the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro not long after a major operation. Julia said: \"Mark was a local hero at home as he managed sponsorship of over \u00a33,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.\" \nUnfortunately when Mark got home he found out that his dad David had terminal cancer. David sadly died in September 2013. \nThroughout his life Mark loved sporting activities, including swimming, football, rugby, cricket and much later rowing. Along with his sister Louise, he joined Aireborough Swimming Club aged seven. He was introduced to Otley Rugby Club by a friend aged 14 and absolutely loved the sport. \nAfter leaving school he trained as a Quantity Surveyor working for a firm in Leeds. He later worked in his dad's landscaping business before in 2014 enrolling on a Master\u2019s degree course in Outdoor and Adventurous Activities, at Leeds Beckett University. He wrote his dissertation on the positive effects of these activities on cancer patients. \nIn 2015 he began work as a teaching assistant at his old school, St Mary\u2019s Menston, a job he loved this job, particularly coaching the Year 7- 9 rugby squads and taking them to tournaments in the school\u2019s minibus. Mark told his mum: \u201cI have finally found my niche\u201d. \nWhen he became seriously ill this year St Mary's were highly supportive and kind to him. \nMark\u2019s final dream and goal was to move back into his Saltaire apartment, overlooking the river, opposite Bradford Rowing Club where he was a member, before he died.

Sinopec alleges it never received full payment for 45,000 tons of steel rebar it agreed to sell PDVSA for $43 million and which was delivered in 2013. \nThe lawsuit, while small in size, says PDVSA through its U.S. subsidiary Bariven reneged on repeated promises to pay Sinopec, at one point costing the Chinese company $2 million in losses after it entered into arbitration with a supplier it agreed to purchase the steel from to carry out the deal. \n\"This is not simply a case of a broken promise to pay,\" Sinopec said in the court documents, accusing PDVSA of \"deceit\" and \"willful deception\" in its refusal to pay its bills. \"Rather, this case involves a complex commercial transaction specifically calculated to leave Sinopec without a remedy.\" \nThe Chinese \"usually take a more diplomatic tone\" and are clearly angry, Russ Dallen, head of local brokerage Caracas Capital, wrote in a report Wednesday in which he revealed the existence of the lawsuit. \nThe dispute comes as Venezuela is seeking fresh financing to restructure its huge foreign debt on which it is behind payment. \nChina has been one of Venezuela's biggest creditors, providing it loans, cash and investment totaling more than $65 billion between 2007 and 2016, according to a database maintained by Boston University and the Inter-American Dialogue. But it has so far failed to come to President Nicolas Maduro's rescue as he tries to shield the OPEC nation from triple-digit inflation, fast-declining oil production and financial sanctions imposed by the Trump administration. \nA spokesman for Beijing-based Sinopec Group confirmed that a U.S. subsidiary of a Sinopec trading company had launched a lawsuit against PDVSA about \"a dispute over payment owed.\" \n\"As a big company, it is normal for us to have such commercial dispute and it is normal to resort to law if there is a dispute,\" Sinopec spokesman Lu Dapeng said by phone. \nGeng Shuang, a spokesman of China's Foreign Ministry, said the issue was nothing more than a regular commercial dispute and that China remains willing to cooperate with Venezuela on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. \n\"I think this is a common commercial dispute and there is no need to make over-interpretations of it,\" Geng said. \"I want to stress that China attaches great importance to the development of China Venezuela relations.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press researchers Yu Bing and Shanshan Wang in Beijing contributed to this report.

After pressuring Oilers blueliner Darnell Nurse into a hooking penalty 54 seconds into the first period, Toronto's power play went to work, and centre Auston Matthews struck for his team-leading 13th goal of the year at 2:15 after a terrific primary assist from winger William Nylander. Three minutes and 40 seconds later, the Buds doubled their lead when centre Dominic Moore beat goalie Laurent Brossoit on the short side for his fourth goal of the season. The Oilers cut the Leafs' lead to 2-1 at the 12:37 mark of the first when forward Mark Letestu netted his fifth goal of the year, but 29 seconds after that goal, Toronto got their third of the night when the fourth line of Nylander, Moore and winger Matt Martin did damage again and Martin scored his second of the season.\nAfter Oilers push back in second and tie the score, Nylander's late-period goal puts Buds back in front. The Leafs were reeling as the period drew to a close, but an ill-considered penalty by Oilers defenceman Eric Gryba with 1:38 left before the second intermission gave Toronto their second power play. And the same three Leafs who collaborated on the Buds' first powerplay goal did so again - only this time it was Nylander scoring his fifth of the season while Gardiner and Matthews picked up the assists.\nOilers D-man Kris Russell delivered a pinpoint pass to McDavid to register the first assist on McDavid's second-period goal, and Russell made a bigger imprint on the scoresheet at the 3:01 mark of the third, as his one-timer shot beat Leafs goalie Frederik Andersen for his second goal of the year and a 4-4 score.\nAlthough the Leafs were outplayed for long stretches of the final two periods, it looked as if the game was headed for overtime - and then, misfortune struck Russell and benefitted the Leafs in one of the more unlikely plays in the league this year. Battling Toronto centre Nazem Kadri for the puck out in front of Brossoit, Russell spun around to face his own goalie, and his swatting attempt to clear the puck instead resulted in a shot that beat the Oilers netminder and put the Leafs ahead 5-4 with 65 seconds remaining in regulation. Leafs winger Patrick Marleau was credited for the goal (his 10th of the season), but Russell was the last person to touch the puck before it entered Edmonton's net. Russell and the Oilers were clearly in shock, and Kadri's empty-net goal with one second left in the third - his 13th of the year, moving him into a tie with Matthews for the team lead in scoring - was an afterthought to the game-winning play. Even the best players in the world can make big mistakes, and this one gave Toronto its second straight win and put them at 2-0 on their current three-game road swing and 17-9-1 overall this year. They now move on to face the Canucks Saturday in Vancouver before a few days off and a match against Calgary Wednesday at Air Canada Centre.\nKadri had always been a player that showed flashes of tremendous potential but just couldn\u2019t get his game up to that next level. Some of this could be the result of having his development rushed to help bring some offense into a weak Leafs lineup or it could be that Mike Babcock was the first coach to get through to him. Not only did Kadri\u2019s shooting percentage come back up to normal levels at 13.5 percent and result in a career high in goals with 32, but he also became the Leafs shutdown guy. Tasked with going up against the top players in the league every night and being expected to hold them off the score sheet, Kadri not only performed well \u2013 he thrived. Welcome to Forum Ice Rain.

This commercialization agreement follows the exclusive global license and development agreement between the two companies that was announced on June 11, 2014.\nUnder the terms of this agreement, MCAG granted BASF exclusive rights to market and sell Broflanilide products in certain markets worldwide, excluding Japan and certain Asian and other countries where MCAG holds exclusive and/or co-exclusive rights.\nBroflanilide is a compound with a novel mode of action, demonstrating excellent efficacy in the control of many problematic chewing insect pests, including caterpillars and beetles in specialty and row crops, and non-crop pests such as termites, ants, cockroaches and flies. It has potential use applications in cereals as a seed treatment for control of wireworms, as well as for foliar use in leafy and fruiting vegetables, potato, soybean, cotton, corn and legumes. The active ingredient was discovered by MCAG and the co-development of the insecticide with BASF began in 2014.\nThe Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) recently approved the classification of Broflanilide as a compound with a new mode of action in Group 30: GABA-gated Cl- channel allosteric modulators. As of today, Broflanilide is the only active ingredient in IRAC Group 30. Given its different chemistry, Broflanilide is a highly effective broad-use compound and a valuable new tool in Insecticide Resistance Management (IRM).\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to continue leveraging the expertise and capabilities of each company to offer promising innovative solutions to growers and pest management professionals seeking alternatives to existing pest-targeting chemistries,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Huff, Senior Vice President Global Strategic Marketing, BASF Crop Protection.\n\u201cWe are also confident that Broflanilide products, with their excellent performance and novel mode of action, can contribute to those in both agriculture and professional pest management seeking effective solutions,\u201d said Shoichi Kondo, Head of MCAG's International Business Division. \u201cThis collaboration will contribute to our future growth.\u201d\nFirst market introductions of Broflanilide products are expected in 2020.

Instead they are refurbished and go into the hands of people who desperately need them and will help them make a living.\" \nAnna Fryer, Incommunities\u2019 Director of Neighbourhoods, said: \u201cThe garages have proved very difficult to let and when Ilkley Tools for Africa got in touch we were delighted to help them. \n\u201cTheir work to improve lives and equip people with the \u2018tools\u2019 to change their lives also reflects our vision and values as a social landlord. \n\u201cWe wish the volunteers every success in their invaluable work.\u201d \nIf you would like to make a donation to Ilkley Tools for Africa or volunteer with the project ring 01943 608655 or email thatcanyon@talktalk.net", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "josie crook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa frank mccrickard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben ryhdding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "incommunities", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna fryer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "incommunities", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilkley tools", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:00.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "52fb0787e9c0d9462a037d3053b44dc36cc6f09e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTYbhkjIy0cBOBf9ZNI2k1BYjTbD7NzHU4MTNCgRvmCeCRBeAmrDjA1XWG31l6zIjHj9IpBGAVO0IEm.wXManPWNiuIYX_Yu2mzyl_DLLJT1Q--", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "site": "huffingtonpost.com", "site_section": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Donald Trump | HuffPost", "title": "#XmasGiftsFromTrump Wish List Will Give Trump A Very Un-Merry Christmas", "title_full": "#XmasGiftsFromTrump Wish List Will Give Trump A Very Un-Merry Christmas | HuffPost", "published": "2017-12-07T10:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a290223150000d59f85bf76.jpeg?cache=zrfcksri44&amp;ops=1910_1000", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 139, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 56, "comments": 1, "shares": 56}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "52fb0787e9c0d9462a037d3053b44dc36cc6f09e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTYbhkjIy0cBOBf9ZNI2k1BYjTbD7NzHU4MTNCgRvmCeCRBeAmrDjA1XWG31l6zIjHj9IpBGAVO0IEm.wXManPWNiuIYX_Yu2mzyl_DLLJT1Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "#XmasGiftsFromTrump Wish List Will Give Trump A Very Un-Merry Christmas", "text": "COMEDY 12/07/2017 04:38 am ET #XmasGiftsFromTrump Wish List Will Give Trump A Very Un-Merry Christmas This won't go over well at the White House.

People walk past a bank electronic board showing the Hong Kong share index outside a Hong Kong local bank Thursday, Dec. 7, 2017. Share prices were mixed in Asia on Thursday, with Japan and Australia leading gains after U.S. inde... \nBy YOUKYUNG LEEAP Business Writer \nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) - European stocks were higher while some Asian markets recovered from the previous day's losses on Thursday as investors focused on the U.S. tax reform and an upcoming U.S. jobs report. \nKEEPING SCORE: Britain's FTSE 200 rose 0.3 percent to 7,366.77 while France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent to 5,383.07. Germany's DAX gained 0.2 percent to 13,028.86. Futures augured flat opening on Wall Street. Dow futures remained unchanged while S&P futures added 0.1 percent. \nASIA'S DAY: Asia closed mixed. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5 percent to 22,498.03 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.5 percent to 5,977.70. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed earlier losses, adding 0.3 percent to 28,303.19. Most other regional benchmarks fell. The Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.7 percent to 3,272.05 and South Korea's Kospi lost 0.5 percent to 2,461.98. Stocks in Southeast Asia were mixed. \nANALYST'S VIEW: \"Asia equity investors found themselves standing in a sea of pain at yesterday's market close and are likely breathing a sigh of relief that both EU and U.S. equity investors appear a bit more level-headed for the time being,\" said Stephen Innes, head of trading at OANDA. \nTAX: The U.S. Senate voted to begin negotiation with the House to reconcile their two tax bills on Wednesday in a sign that they can iron out differences. Republican leaders are pushing to send a final blended package to President Donald Trump to sign before Christmas. \nGEOPOLITICAL ISSUES: Market reaction was muted to President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, ending decades of unwavering U.S. neutrality on the issue. In other global developments, the British and Irish prime ministers spoke, seeking to overcome a logjam in Brexit talks, but there was no sign of an imminent breakthrough. \nU.S. JOBS: A report from payroll processor ADP showed private employers added 190,000 jobs last month, slightly better than expected. The report comes two days before a government jobs report, among the last key economic indicators before the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. \nOIL: Benchmark U.S. crude recovered slightly. It added 7 cents to $56.13 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Wednesday, the contract sank $1.66 to settle at $55.96 per barrel.

The top food sources of WG based on NHANES 2001 to 2002 data for all persons 2 years and older included ready-to-eat (RTE) cereals (28.7%), yeast breads (25.3%), hot cereal (13.7%), and popcorn (12.4%) [13]. However, the release of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines and accompanying media attention has increased consumer demand for WG foods [14] and resulted in greater Talazoparib mw WG food availability [15]. Results from a US national survey in 2012 [16] indicated that WG and fiber content were top considerations when buying packaged foods for 67% and 62% of consumers, respectively. Given the greater visibility of WG recommendations since 2005 and increased consumer demand, an updated assessment of WG sources, intake, and relationship to total dietary fiber is needed. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended an increased intake of WG and total dietary fiber [8] based on low current intakes, reported associations with lower chronic \ndisease risk, risk indicators and overweight [1], [17], [18], [19] and [20], and higher overall Stem Cells antagonist diet quality [9], [10] and [21]. Cooked dry beans and peas, other vegetables, fruit, and WG were recommended as food sources to meet total dietary fiber recommendations [8]. Previous studies have suggested that consumers associate WG foods with fiber and may be confused regarding the difference between WG and total dietary fiber [22], [23] and [24]. Clarification of the contribution that WG foods make to total dietary fiber based on the most recent dietary intake data \nwill allow educators to promote WG foods for the array of RG7420 clinical trial nutritional benefits that are provided, including total dietary fiber. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that associations exist between WG intake and total dietary fiber intake of Americans 2 years and older. In addition, the contribution of various food sources to WG intake was identified. Specific research objectives were to (1) determine whether associations exist between WG intake group (no-WG intake, 0 oz eq; low, >0-<3 oz eq; high, \u22653 oz eq) and total dietary fiber intake among children and adolescents (age, 2-18 years) and adults (age, \u226519 years) by examining the odds of falling into a specific WG intake group by total dietary fiber intake tertile, (2) to determine if total dietary fiber intake from various food sources differs by WG intake, (3) to determine if the percentage of total dietary fiber contributed by types of RTE cereal varies by WG intake, and (4) to identify the contribution of different food sources to WG intake. Data from NHANES 2009 to 2010 were used for the present analysis [25]. The continuous NHANES is a cross-sectional survey that collects data about the nutrition and health status of the US population using a complex, multistage, probability sampling design [25].

The Senate seemed ready to follow. Without legislation, many agencies would run out of money after midnight Friday and grind to a close. \nThe two-week spending measure is aimed at giving both parties' bargainers more time to reach longer-term budget decisions. To jumpstart that negotiating, Trump and congressional leaders were meeting Thursday to try reaching agreements. \nThe prospects for successful White House talks were buffeted Wednesday when the impulsive Trump blurted to reporters that a shutdown \"could happen.\" He blamed Democrats, saying they want \"illegal immigrants pouring into our country, bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.\" \nLast week, an unexpected attack by Trump on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., prompted the two Democrats to skip a bargaining session that was planned then. \nThis time, the White House smoothed the waters by following up with a more peaceable, written statement. It praised Pelosi and Schumer for choosing to \"put their responsibility to the American people above partisanship\" and said Trump was anticipating productive talks between \"leaders who put their differences aside.\" \nLater, the White House issued another statement indicating Trump would sign the two-week spending extension. It also laid out administration budget goals, saying money for the military including missile defense and security along the border with Mexico \"must be prioritized in a long-term funding agreement.\" \nFor Republicans, a shutdown would put a humiliating bookend on a year in which they've controlled the White House and Congress with little to show for it. They want the public to focus instead on the GOP's prized $1.5 trillion tax bill, which party leaders hope to send Trump by Christmas. \nThe two-week spending bill also makes money available to several states that are running out of funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program. That widely popular program provides medical care to more than 8 million children. \nEven the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members have been threatening to oppose the temporary spending measure, predicted passage. \n\"No one wants a shutdown, including Freedom Caucus members,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told reporters. \nThe roughly 30-member caucus has been trying to win promises from leaders of spending curbs and quick passage of a full-year defense budget in exchange for backing the short-term bill. Without support from many of them, Republicans would need votes from Democrats to push the temporary spending measure through the House. \nWhile many Democrats seemed likely to oppose the short-term bill, enough were expected to support it in the Senate to allow its passage there. They know they'd still have leverage on subsequent bills needed to keep the government running. \nRepublicans control the Senate 52-48 and will need at least eight Democratic votes for passage. \nDemocrats have been using their leverage to insist on spending boosts for health care, infrastructure and other domestic programs that would match increases Republicans want for defense. \nDemocrats are also seeking an agreement to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. Trump ended safeguards against deportation three months ago but has expressed an openness to restoring them. \n___ \nAP reporters Andrew Taylor and Ken Thomas contributed.

"text": "Ilkley Business Awards Litter louts must pay \u00a320,000 in total after ignoring \u00a380 fines as Bradford Council takes 55 people to court 0 comments \nDOZENS of people who failed to pay on-the-spot \u00a380 fines for dropping litter in Bradford have been taken to court by the Council and ordered to pay more than \u00a320,000 in total. \nSince July this year private enforcement officers have been operating in the district, handing out fixed penalty notices to those dropping litter or who let their dogs foul pavements. \nIn five months the team from private security firm 3GS have handed out 2,500 \u00a380 notices, many of which were paid. \nBut those that ignored the demand have ended up being taken to court by Bradford Council. \nLast week magistrates in the city dealt with cases against 55 people who had failed to pay a fixed penalty notice and had subsequently pleaded guilty by post to dropping litter. \nThe courts imposed a total of \u00a312,296 in fines with \u00a39,440 in costs, equating to an average of more than \u00a3395 each. \nIn addition each person convicted now also has a criminal record. \nCouncillor Sarah Ferriby, the Council\u2019s executive member for environment, sport and culture, warned people not to litter, but also not to ignore any on-the-spot fine. \nShe said: \u201cThe message is clear, don\u2019t drop litter if you don\u2019t want to get a fixed penalty notice but if you do get one, don\u2019t ignore it because it won\u2019t go away. \n\u201cThe last thing we want to do is to give people a criminal record and drag them through the courts, but if behaviour doesn\u2019t change, we don\u2019t have much choice. \n\"If you are caught dropping litter, and you don\u2019t pay the \u00a380, then you will end up with a much more painful bill. \n\u201cDropping litter and leaving it to blight our streets is just another form of anti-social behaviour. We just want people to stop and think about what they are going to do with their rubbish and dispose of it properly.\u201d \nThe Council brought in the private firm in July in a bid to get tough on people who drop cigarette butts or chewing gum, let their dogs foul pavements, or urinate or spit in the street. \nThe zero tolerance approach also saw littering fines increased from \u00a375 to \u00a380 and an early payment discount scrapped. \nUnder the new contract, 3GS employ eight staff members in black enforcement officer uniforms seven days a week. \nThey are based at City Hall and focus on the city centre but may also patrol other litter hotspots across the district. \nUntil the contract with 3GS, council wardens had been responsible for handing out littering fines. A total of 106 fines were issued in 2015, dropping to 77 last year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bradford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah ferriby", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ilkley business awards litter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bradford council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bradford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "city hall", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:04:01.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b18bdb68ade35082bdd4ec03d75463c554746f7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYuQQFbqmmfaM3W7EV2UFwa5qBIWeCzRLxcVdxYUGNd9l6.pea.9wIeS2xFff8YCYf8zl2LyICTd4ra4DMvfHGWKDaChr5YY_jQ--", "site_full": "www.adverts.ie", "site": "adverts.ie", "site_section": "http://www.adverts.ie/for-sale/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Adverts.ie - Recent Ads All 824,848 listings", "title": "Monster High Die-ner and Draculaura Doll Playset", "title_full": "Monster High Die-ner and Draculaura Doll Playset", "published": "2017-12-07T11:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://a1.amlimg.com/Y2FkMzg2ZmE2NmIzMzAyMGE1MWJkMTIwZThiMDI1N2M6Y3vSmXzs4JOr9x11kmHPaHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmFkc2ltZy5jb20vMDdjNjY0NjNkNTBkYmNiYzA2YTdmZGQ0ZmZkOGE4YzFlYzFlM2JmMDM1M2ZiNjVhMDViNGQxNzdmYTliNWQ4ZS5qcGd8fHx8fHwzOTN4Mjk0fGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuYWR2ZXJ0cy5pZS9zdGF0aWMvaS93YXRlcm1hcmsucG5nfHx8.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b18bdb68ade35082bdd4ec03d75463c554746f7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSRBdoLyYHfYuQQFbqmmfaM3W7EV2UFwa5qBIWeCzRLxcVdxYUGNd9l6.pea.9wIeS2xFff8YCYf8zl2LyICTd4ra4DMvfHGWKDaChr5YY_jQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "Monster High Die-ner and Draculaura Doll Playset", "text": "You must be logged in to contact advertiser.
