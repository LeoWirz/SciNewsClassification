(TOKYO:4519) announced today that positive interim results have been reported from the global phase III HAVEN 4 study (NCT03020160) for emicizumab (ACE910) subcutaneous injection, every four weeks, in patients with hemophilia A (12 years of age or older) with and without inhibitors to factor VIII. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of emicizumab prophylaxis. At this interim analysis after a median of 17 weeks of treatment, emicizumab prophylaxis demonstrated a clinically meaningful control of bleeding over time. These results from HAVEN 4 are consistent with previous studies of emicizumab dosed once weekly or every two weeks to evaluate the reduction of bleed rate, including the pivotal studies in hemophilia A with inhibitors, phase III HAVEN 1 study (NCT02622321) in adults and adolescents and phase III HAVEN 2 study (NCT02795767) in children, as well as the phase III HAVEN 3 study (NCT02847637) in adults and adolescents (12 years of age or older) with hemophilia A without inhibitors. The most common adverse events with emicizumab were injection site reactions, with no new safety signals observed. No thrombotic microangiopathy or thrombotic events have been reported in this study. Further details will be presented at a future medical meeting. These results will be submitted to health authorities around the world for approval consideration. \"If emicizumab prophylaxis once every four weeks is proven to be effective in controlling bleeding regardless of the inhibitor status to factor VIII, it would advance the possibility to further prolong the administration interval of emicizumab,\" said Chugai's Senior Vice President, Head of Project & Lifecycle Management Unit, Dr. Yasushi Ito. \"These interim results represent the potential to ease the burden surrounding hemophilia treatment experienced by patients or their family in their daily life and to increase the medical value of emicizumab.\" Emicizumab is an investigational bispecific monoclonal antibody, which was developed using Chugai's proprietary antibody engineering technologies. The drug is designed to bind factor lXa and factor X. In doing so, emicizumab provides the cofactor function of factor VIII in people with hemophilia A, who either lack or have impaired coagulation function of factor Vlll 1,2) . In November this year, the drug (US product name: HEMLIBRA \u00ae ; Genentech) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \"for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adult and pediatric patients with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) with factor VIII inhibitors\". An EU marketing authorization application was submitted in June 2017 and is being reviewed under Accelerated Assessment by the European Medicines Agency. In Japan, emicizumab obtained an orphan drug designation in August 2016 from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for the prevention and reduction of bleeding episodes in patients with congenital factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) who developed inhibitors to FVIII, followed by an application for regulatory approval filed in July 2017. About HAVEN 4 study (NCT03020160) HAVEN 4 study is a single-arm, multicentre, open-label, phase III study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous administration of emicizumab dosed every four weeks. The study included 48 patients (12 years of age or older) with hemophilia A with or without inhibitors to factor VIII who were previously treated with either on-demand or prophylactic factor VIII or bypassing agents, depending on their inhibitor status. The primary endpoint of the study is the bleed rate with emicizumab prophylaxis and secondary endpoints include joint bleed rate, target joint bleed rate, health-related quality of life (HRQoL)/ health status, and safety. Patients with or without inhibitors to factor VIII previously treated with either on-demand or prophylactic factor VIII or bypassing agents were enrolled in two cohorts.

However, according to respondents to Deloitte\u2019s fifth M&A trends survey, many of these fears will begin to diminish moving forward, resulting in increased dealmaking activity and increased deal values. \nBoth in the number of deals and the size of transactions, Deloitte expects 2018 to be a bumper year for M&A. Of the 1000 US corporate dealmakers and private equity firms surveyed for \u2018The State of the Deal: M&A Trends 2018\u2019 report, around 68 percent of corporate executives and 76 percent of private equity leaders expect to see an increase in deal volume over the next 12 months. Additionally, most respondents believe deal size will either increase or stay the same in 2018, compared with deals brokered in 2017. \nTechnology-based dealmaking was recognised as the biggest potential driver of corporate M&A transactions, rising from 6 percent in the spring 2016 survey to 20 percent in this survey. \n\"There are strong signals that corporations and private equity firms are targeting bigger deals and anticipating brisker activity in 2018,\" said Russell Thomson, managing partner of Deloitte's US M&A services practice. \"The appetite for technologies like machine learning, robotics, artificial intelligence and advanced analytics is large and growing. We're seeing some organisations buy smaller tech companies to enable strategic growth and others \u2014 typically companies well outside of the tech sector \u2014 actively looking to converge their businesses with tech companies to achieve marked transformation.\" \nAway from the tech space, expanding customer bases in existing markets, and expanding and diversifying products and services, are set to be leading drivers of M&A deals. Among other positive factors, the Deloitte report notes that cash reserves are up significantly for potential acquirers, and that the primary intended use of that cash is for acquisitions. \nDivestitures should also be a major focus in 2018. Seventy percent of survey respondents noted that their company plans to divest businesses next year. This rush of unit shedding will be driven by financing needs and strategy shifts.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "richard summerfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deloitte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russell thomson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "deloitte", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:26.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "537f9681d8c8ac18a814a84284a46d881484c924", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9EnZRaY.EbMhPD87xREQZ8H3CNdFcN2myi1lvttkBha.P.WUHcIK_P_REX2PrEDBj974wVC_fofJyuq9ebQRo215XSTO2krS5qnQ8Mxk_ClLseCwBNovQYkVkLE9bMR3UDUeGimLOUfw--", "site_full": "www.qtelljoblotsforum.com", "site": "qtelljoblotsforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.qtelljoblotsforum.com/feed/posts/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Qtellwholesale joblots Forums Free Advertising Business Mobile Phones Power Job Lots Free Classified Ads Global Joblots  - Qtellwholesale joblots Forums Free Advertising Business Mobile Phones Power Job Lots Free Classified Ads Global Joblots", "title": "MRI Scan ( Bethesda)", "title_full": "MRI Scan ( Bethesda)", "published": "2017-12-07T09:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.qtelljoblotsforum.com/adpics/5a28f1e742f30289de0fb7dbd.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "537f9681d8c8ac18a814a84284a46d881484c924", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9EnZRaY.EbMhPD87xREQZ8H3CNdFcN2myi1lvttkBha.P.WUHcIK_P_REX2PrEDBj974wVC_fofJyuq9ebQRo215XSTO2krS5qnQ8Mxk_ClLseCwBNovQYkVkLE9bMR3UDUeGimLOUfw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "MRI Scan ( Bethesda)", "text": "  07:46   07:46   07:46 Hits : 98   \nCapital Imaging, LLC is dedicated to providing our patients with a positive experience while generating precise MRI and X-Ray images.We are an ACR accredited facility conveniently located in Bethesda, Maryland.

Gareth Southgate is looking at the best way to prepare his players for Russia 2018 ahead of their opening game against Tunisia. And talks have been held with the Nigerian FA over the two countries facing each other in the first week of June. Southgate is spending the next couple of weeks finalising his plans to ensure his squad is fully fit and sharp by the time they face Tunisia in Volgograd on  June 18 . While most of the preparations will be done at St George\u2019s Park, the England boss is yet to decide whether the team could benefit from a few days together overseas. All options are still being considered, with England having to be in Russia now less than five days before their first match. Since the World Cup draw was held in Moscow last week, officials have spoken to several other nations about possible warm-up matches. Nigeria are one of those, but as yet the FA and Southgate have not made any decision about who would be best to face. Full planning could only begin once each team knew their fixtures, with some having to report for the tournament almost a week before others. Nigerian Football Federation general secretary Mohammed Sanusi said: \u201cWe plan to play a friendly against England in June, before the World Cup.\u201d Sanusi added the venue and other details of the game were yet to be decided. The Super Eagles, managed by German Gernot Rohr, begin their Group D quest against Croatia in Kaliningrad before facing Iceland and Argentina. Captained by ex-Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel, their squad is set to include Premier League stars such as Kelechi Iheanacho, Alex Iwobi, Wilfred Ndidi and Ahmed Musa. England have met Nigeria twice before, winning 1-0 at Wembley in 1994 and drawing 0-0 in Osaka during the 2002 World Cup.

Before these kids ever come to us, we are not the only ones recruiting these youngsters. Talent is being recruited all the time in every shape and form.\n\u201cWe are not running this the way a billion-dollar industry should be run. We try and put a circle into a square, that\u2019s what men\u2019s college basketball is. It\u2019s not a bad circle, it\u2019s a great one, but it can\u2019t be done like a square.\u201d\nAs part of an ongoing FBI investigation that began in 2015, four NCAA assistant coaches were indicted by federal authorities last week in a fraud and corruption scheme that alleged numerous instances of bribes to athletes. Federal prosecutors referred to the findings as \u201cthe dark underbelly of college athletics.\u201d\nMore: Doyel: Amidst NCAA basketball scandal, college presidents trying to save the game \u2014 but is it beyond saving?\nMore: Federal probe could uncover deeper roots in college basketball scandal\nSimilar to North Carolina coach Roy Williams earlier in the week, Krzyzewski was hesitant to paint such a dark picture on the entire sport \u2014 despite harping on the need for major change.\n\u201cLast week was bad, but that doesn\u2019t mean all of college basketball is bad,\u201d said Krzyzewski. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s necessarily the tip of the iceberg. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with that. I think the iceberg is really good. \u2026 That\u2019s a slap in the face last week. But it\u2019s forced dialogue about the middle \u2014 amateurism. Do you pay them? Do you do this? Do you do that? I think those are good discussions.\u201d\nWhen discussing a possible solution, Krzyzewski took a subtle jab at President Trump.\n\u201cThe biggest thing you can pull on \u2014 I wish our president would understand this \u2014 is economic pressure,\u201d Krzyzewski said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to destroy everybody. You can make them hurt with economic pressure, and we\u2019ve got to be careful about those things (because) this is a great game.\u201d\nThe federal investigation also notably implicated major shoe and apparel companies, including Adidas. One of the defendants, Merl Code, left Nike to work for Adidas, and is charged with assisting another Adidas employee in paying high school players with the goal of them signing with Adidas-sponsored schools before eventually signing with the shoe company in the professional ranks. Although Nike was not listed in complaints from the investigation that were released last week, the company\u2019s Elite Youth Basketball League was served a subpoena last week in correlation with the investigation, according to a report by ESPN.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this thing about shoe companies giving kids money is rampant,\u201d Krzyzewski said,whose school has a contract with Nike.\nKrzyzewski, who won a national championship in 2015 with a roster loaded with one-and-done players, thinks high school players should be eligible to play in the NBA and suggested governing bodies including the NCAA, NBA players\u2019 association, and shoe companies like Nike and Adidas should sit down at one table to help better the game \u2014 mainly in its recruiting culture.\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no progress,\u201d said Krzyzewski, who coached Team USA to three gold medals. \u201cThere is progress on what a player gets in college now, but that is only enforced upon the NCAA because of litigation.\u201d\nDuke coach Mike Krzyzewski takes aim at NCAA college basketball problems Division I's winningest coach says the business model lacks the necessary leadership and is not equipped to handle the recruiting landscape.\nRead more", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:26.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a80ccb75606bc6e8478020e621526ee246997203", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQuMByrzEgoBIljLuxZuC.QUjD6nmUlkK1xrHR2Oxv1LsEQhIREOS_26Da9CopHmvmLJqkKjZcrsBMT0PSdgzgkF8A3dnaoOdsfdWMnO1RChw6Wp.uW_WZT.S9UF2bva3RmiUZTe41nA74Vq9FEt3EW", "site_full": "scout.com", "site": "scout.com", "site_section": "https://scout.com/college/louisville/Board/The-Yum-103990", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Louisville Cardinals The Yum!

That day, I stood home from school because I had a doctor\u0092s appointment. In the morning, I didn\u0092t text him to let him know if I was coming or not. So the day was going okay and then later on when school was over, he goes to a program that we both go to. He was with a friend and when I texted his phone explaining to him why I didn\u0092t text him in the morning, the girl had his phone and was answering for him. She spoke to me the entire time and was having a full on conversation with me. At one point, she asked me what was going on with me and him and I didn\u0092t go into specific details because I didn\u0092t really want her to know the issues since she\u0092s been known for ruining certain things and having a big mouth. When the program was finished, she texted me to tell me that he was cheating on me and that she found photos of another guy in his phone. This turned out to be a prank that was played by both of them. When he finally texted me, I confronted him about it and he said that he didn\u0092t cheat but that an old friend of his sent a photo to him of a guy that he used to like in middle school because of how he treated him during some of his lowest times. He said that the photos brought back old memories and that they brought back old feelings. He then asked me if he could call me and we spoke. It turns out that he told the girl everything that we were going through when we had problems in the relationship and he showed her our texts from when things started to go bad. It turns out that she was on the phone with him the whole time and trying to tell him what to say. He gave her my number and she ended up calling me to tell me straight up that he wanted to dump me. When I asked her for the reason, she didn\u0092t wanna say. His reasoning was that he was going through a lot of personal stress/issues and also me always arguing with him over every little things made him unhappy and wanted to break up. But, just days before, he never mentioned breaking up. He only said that he wanted to be with me and was willing to fix things but that things are complicated at the moment and he is just trying to figure out his feelings. The girl told him things like: \u0093You guys have nothing in common anyway so what is the point in being together?\u0094 And then also said \u0093If you\u0092re unhappy then you should just dump him\u0094. She basically added more fuel to the fire. I was very hurt and so far me and him haven\u0092t made any contact yet. I heard from another manipulative friend from him that he said he doesn\u0092t know if he\u0092d wanna get back together with me and another friend said that he was crying and explained how he still does care but doesn\u0092t want me back ever again. A close friend of mine texted him herself to see what\u0092s really going on and he explained how he isn\u0092t ready for a relationship at the moment but is willing to start fresh and possibly be friends first before dating again. He also told her that he\u0092s ready to talk whenever I am but I honestly don\u0092t know what to do. I want to but I also wanna give it more time and give him more space. He\u0092s also been hanging out with the two manipulative girls a lot more lately. (Btw, the girl that caused these issues is a lesbian so there is no possible chance that she is trying to get with him. The other girl is already in a relationship and is just a close friend of his but even he doesn\u0092t like hanging with her as much).\nAnother interesting detail to add is that I spoke to the other girl (not the lesbian) to tell her what the girl who caused the issues said and did and she started talking crap about her but later on in the night, on the girl\u0092s Snapchat, they were all seen hanging out in the video and getting along.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:27.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "abadaf0e825c0405ab58f7057f35a1f2eb6266b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTPjwXBrB6VWQqFNiGMagQdxJ9upFZP372gBoGQQCfF0mUeZ2bm2Osony5IsJxvWfg-", "site_full": "www.enotalone.com", "site": "enotalone.com", "site_section": "https://www.enotalone.com/forum/", "site_categories": ["marriage", "social"], "section_title": "eNotAlone: Relationship advice forum", "title": "Bf dumped me but I think he was manipulated! - Relationship Advice", "title_full": "Bf dumped me but I think he was manipulated! - Relationship Advice", "published": "2017-12-07T07:39:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f3b1f8d091f809541f9b2d49daaf0435509af7a2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTPjwXBrB6VWQqFNiGMagQdxJ9upFZP372gBoGQQCfF0mUeZ2bm2Osoux4dY9iurmhIHxm0JuQu4J9E4rXWkTCJ89IrzvS1m4s-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Whoknows33 Join Date", "published": "2017-12-07T07:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Sounds to me like dark forces.

LET HIM FIGHT FOR HIMSELF.\n\nBEING HONEST AND RESPECTFULLY CONDUCTING YOURSELF WITH DECORUM IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC WHILE BELIEVING AND REACHING GOD THROUGH YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS NOT CRIMINALS WHO ARE DETERMINED TO STEAL YOU TO STUPOR GETS YOU CLOSER TO GOD.\n\nPREACH GOD AND SHOW TRUE EXAMPLES. TALKING GOD ONE MINUTE AND ABUSING OTHERS NEXT MINUTE, KEEPING MALICE WITH THE WORLD, CALLING OTHERS UNPRINTABLE NAMES, BEING ETERNALLY PUGNACIOUS AND EXPECTING EVERYONE TO BE AFRAID OF YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE A PASTOR ETC IS PURE IGNORANCE AND HYPOCRISY.\n\nNOT EVERYONE IS A COWARD LIKE YOU. SO DON'T WALK INTO THE STREET PREACHING GOD YOU DO NOT EVEN BELIEVE IN OR WITH BLAZING GUNS AND THINK THAT EVERYONE IS A FOOL OR COWARD LIKE YOU AND WILL RUN AWAY. THERE ARE MANY BRAVE HEARTS WHO WILL TAKE YOU ON AND DOWN TOO.\n\nTRUE BELIEVERS ARE RESPECTFUL OF THEMSELVES, OTHERS AND NEVER HATEFUL OR CONCEITED.\n\nSO CALLING ON GOD TO DESTROY THOSE WHO REFUSE TO SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR GOSPEL OF NONSENSE AND MIND DISTORTION GETS YOU INTO HELL NEVER HEAVEN.\n\nREPENT AND RECEIVE COMMON SENSE IF YOU ARE IN THIS LEAGUE.\n\nHUMILITY IS NOT STUPIDITY AND NO ONE HAS MONOPOLY OF ARROGANCE AND IGNORANCE. SO NEVER TAKE ANYONE'S POLITENESS FOR WEAKNESS. WE ARE ALL CAPABLE OF GOOD AND EVIL. IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF THE RIGHT TRIGGER.\n\nTHE ERA OF DO NOT JUDGE SO THAT YOU MAY NOT BE JUDGED OR TOUCH OR SPEAK NOT AGAINST MY ANOINTED IS OVER. MANY OF YOU ARE NOT CALLED OR ANOINTED. SO DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN SCARE MANY OF US ANYMORE.\n\nCROOKED BUSINESS PEOPLE ARMED WITH THE BIBLE MUST STOP HIDING BEHIND THE WORD TO LIVE THEIR WICKEDNESS. THE WORLD IS BETTER AWARE AND READY FOR YOU NOW. GOD'S REAL SOLDIERS ARE OUT TO RECLAIM HIS EARTH FOR HIM WITH THE TRUTH NOT THE TYPE OF LIES YOU TELL. \n\nThe secret behind successful business growth is planning and hard work not prayers without hardwork.\n\nThe wicked ploy of the thieves of the consciousness and conscience of men called men and women of God is stealing from the vulnerable with bible as their weapon of mass mind distortion and cassock and collars as symbols of piety which masks the demons in them and the evil they represent.\n\nIt breaks my heart to see educated people talking God without hardwork and attacking those who call their attention to their descent into moral and spiritual oblivion because of servitude to men and women who have perfected the art of mind distortion as a means to living Off others.\n\nHere is Ali Baba. If he was talking God like many mind trapped Africans and blacks have been talking, we will not be rushing to him to buy everything we need.\n\nSo listen to him and receive sense.\n\nGod won't be happy to see you perish due to spiritual servitude to devils dressed like men and women of God.\n\nEnough said.

(NYSE: CSTM ) and (Euronext Paris:CSTM) announced today that it has strengthened its long-term partnership with Audi to supply aluminium Automotive Body Sheet as well as structural components for the new Audi A7 Sportback. Produced at the Audi Neckarsulm, Germany, plant, the new Audi A7 embodies Audi's new design language with particularly dynamic lines and a sporty character. \nConstellium will be the primary supplier of aluminium Automotive Body Sheet for this new Audi A7 providing the coils to be used for the outer design applications such as the doors, hood, fenders and deck lids which incorporate large surfaces, sharp edges and taut lines. Design and forms are achieved with Constellium's Surfalex\u00ae with high surface quality and specific hemming and roping properties, which allow three-dimensional shapes and is ideally suited for the dynamic body style of this new model.

I have a growing wish list of products from the brand that I so want to try out, so when a couple of their foundations landed on my desk, I couldn't wait to try them. \n\nThe newest foundation additions to the Ordinary's range, are the Serum Foundation and the Coverage Foundation, and what is really impressive is that they are both available in a massive 21 shades, and secondly they are so super affordable at just $12.70 and $12.90 each. But what's cheap, if they don't perform... So I've put them to the test.. \n\nLet's start with The Ordinary Serum Foundation , which is a serum textured lightweight foundation that promises a natural-looking medium coverage while softening undesirable hues and reduces imperfections. I love that the foundation is literally light as air, and it blends so quickly and easily, though you do have to work extremely fast before it absorbs into the skin. Once one, it does give the skin a very light sheer coverage and a nice velvety matte finish, which I really like on my combination skin. I do have quite some pigmentation, breakouts, scars from past acne and fine lines, and while it does even everything out a little making it look less obvious, however much I like this foundation, and think its great option for casual days, unfortunately I feel my 'flawed' skin needs a little extra coverage. As for wear, again on my combination skin, I did get shiny on especially the t-zone in the middle of the day and also slightly settled in lines, but that said, that's pretty standard for most foundations on my skin. But considering its super lightweight formula, it wears surprisingly well. \n\nThen there's The Ordinary Coverage Foundation is a heavier formula and with a high coverage, which I really like, especially when I'm going out. It easily covers everything from redness, along with most pigmentation, breakouts and scarring, while still leaving the skin looking quite natural, and not look like the foundation has been caked on. You can also build up the coverage every so slightly, but if applying too much, I do find it's looking less natural. \n\nThe foundation has a slightly thicker consistency than the Serum Foundation, but surprisingly it is still quite light, and with my combination skin, I really like that it is non-oily, and dries to a velvety matte finish. I also love that it has such a long wear, even on my skin that tends to get greasy mid day, and that it doesn't settle into fine lines or change colour. \n\nConsidering the budget prices, these foundations really are great. I actually like both, I only wish I didn't feel my skin needed that little bit extra coverage than what the Serum Foundation provides, and therefore the Coverage Foundation is clearly my favourite of the two. \n\nThe foundations come in simple plastic bottles with easy to use pumps - and if you like me has ever dropped a foundation in a glass bottle , you'll remember how messy it can get, so really appreciating the plastic bottle. \n\nI tried the shade 2.0N for both foundations, which is described as a Light Medium with a neutral base, and it is a really good match for my skin. And that brings me to talk about the elaborate colour chart, which makes it so much easier to select your perfect foundation shade when shopping online. \n\nHowever, I do have to say that while I selected the same shade for both foundations, they are not completely the same, with the serum foundation appearing slightly warmer, though thankfully both are still a good match. \n\nThe Ordinary Colours Serum Foundation - RRP: $12.70 / 30ml \nThe Ordinary Full Coverage Foundation - RRP: $12.90 / 30ml \n\nAvailable from Deciem Stores and online , and Priceline \n\n\n* Some products may have been kindly provided for editorial consideration, and have been reviewed in accordance with my Disclosure Policy, and reviews are 100% honest and based on personal opinion and experience.

Nine species currently live in the region, but scientists believe great white sharks (made famous by the movie Jaws ) could be making a comeback. \nQuestions remain over just how many could be moving back into northern waters and how climate change-induced warming waters could impact how long they stay. \nNew research first reported by the APsuggests great whites may be making Maine a new home. According to James Sulikowski, a scientist at the University of New England, great whites have been known to swim through waters off the coast of Maine, but relatively little data has been available on exactly how many there were or where they were going. Even less understood was whether or not their populations were increasing. \nBut in 2016, a noted shark scientist from the Massachusetts Marine Fisheries Department, Gregory Skomal, was looking to create a more complete map of shark territory off the coast of the northeastern Atlantic. ( Read more about why great white sharks are still a mystery to us.) \nHe and Sulikowski worked to install acoustic tracking receivers in waters near a seal colony at Old Orchard Beach in southern Maine. To better understand great white populations, Skomal has outfitted about 120 sharks with acoustic transmitters. Every time a shark wearing a transmitter swims past a corresponding receiver, it pings the researchers. \nIt was one of these individuals that pinged the scientists when it swam through southern Maine in 2016, and in 2017, a different shark also outfitted with a transmitter was registered. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for them to be in the Gulf of Maine,\u201d said Sulikowski. \u201cBut it is to have them repeatedly coming to the same area.\u201d \nHe suspects they\u2019re looking for food. Great whites primarily prey on pinnipeds like seals and sea lions, but they also hunt marine mammals found in Atlantic waters. \nMore Sharks in the Water \nSkomal, with the state of Massachusetts, conducts annual aerial surveys. In 2009, as few as five were spotted, but in 2016, researchers spotted about 150. \nThe exact population count is unclear, both scientists noted. They can only gather data for the sharks they see, but for every shark they identify, said Sulikowski, \u201cthere are probably many more that have been going undetected.\u201d \nSkomal sees the growing shark populations off the East Coast as a conservation success story. Great whites are a protected species, and many of the prey they need to survive are also protected. It\u2019s more likely that sharks are returning to historic population levels, he said, than growing exceptionally large. \nWarming Oceans \nGreat whites have a large range. The western Atlantic population migrates as far south as the Gulf of Mexico in the winter, and in the summer, they can be found in waters as far north as Newfoundland, Canada. \nThe scientists\u2019 next steps are to figure out how climate change may be impacting these growing populations. Unlike other species of sharks, great whites are endothermic, which means they can regulate their own body temperature instead of moving to warmer or colder waters. \n\u201cThose fish will be less impacted by climate change,\u201d said Skomal. \u201cThey have a great flexibility to tolerate changing temperatures.\u201d \nMigration routes could still be impacted, but it\u2019s unclear by how much. Sulikowski explained that sharks migrate to warmer waters to expend less energy acclimating to colder waters. This helps them conserve energy during mating season. If northern waters stay warmer for longer, both scientists are unsure of how shark migration will be impacted. \n\u201cAs climate change takes place, their movement may change,\u201d said Sulikowski. \u201cThey could hang around Maine longer.\u201d \nRising shark populations could also create more competition for resources, pushing sharks farther outside the range they\u2019ve inhabited for the past few decades. \nMore research, he said, is needed to fully understand whether the sharks have found a new summer home in Maine, or if they\u2019re simply stopping by on their way to farther north summer grounds in Canada.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sulikowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james sulikowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skomal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gregory skomal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of new england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts marine fisheries department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "more sharks", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "maine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "old orchard beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf of mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newfoundland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf of maine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:25:28.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a408e421f67ea9a3c163b27758c551d86899d573", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMopbZsP2F.BPzPPlhmSPo0PVi2lqZOWf43muFVcKtt8qiMUQgR8Gh34IZSu06MrX8YNrE.r_PWGbr755U7V7mru8taqiYBOL6fpYxOyJ_wyDg--", "site_full": "trueviralnews.com", "site": "trueviralnews.com", "site_section": "http://trueviralnews.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "True Viral News", "title": "Early Earth Took a Heavy Beating After the Moon Was Formed", "title_full": "Early Earth Took a Heavy Beating After the Moon Was Formed", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a408e421f67ea9a3c163b27758c551d86899d573", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMopbZsP2F.BPzPPlhmSPo0PVi2lqZOWf43muFVcKtt8qiMUQgR8Gh34IZSu06MrX8YNrE.r_PWGbr755U7V7mru8taqiYBOL6fpYxOyJ_wyDg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "TVN stuff", "published": "2017-12-07T11:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "Early Earth Took a Heavy Beating After the Moon Was Formed", "text": "Early Earth was bombarded by material that plunged all the way to its core or splashed off, requiring the planet to take more hits to deposit some of the elements present in its mantle. \nCredit: Southwest Research Institute \nEarth may have been bruised by the impact of more than one moon-size object early in its life. \nNew simulations suggest that much of the material that crashed into our young planet may have been swallowed up by Earth\u2019s core or ricocheted back into space, requiring more collisions to leave the elemental signatures scientists see in the crust today. \nThe young solar system was a violent place. Planetesimals, the massive objects that didn\u2019t quite manage to grow into planets, wound up destroying themselves as they crashed into other objects during a period known as late accretion. These collisions left traces of highly siderophile elements \u2013 metals have an affinity for iron, such as gold, platinum and iridium- within our planet\u2019s mantle. [ How the Moon Formed: 5 Wild Theories] \nBy measuring how much of these metals was mixed into the mantle, scientists estimated that about half a percent of the Earth\u2019s present mass came from colliding planetesimals. But these estimates assumed that the mantle held onto all of the highly siderophile elements. \nNew simulations suggest that instead, some of the material might have been carried all the way into the core, where it would have mixed up or would have been thrown out of the system entirely. Both outcomes would have reduced the amount of metals that would have mixed into the mantle. That means Earth may have absorbed two to five times as many impacts as previously thought. \nThis Southwest Research Institute animation depicts an object 3,000 kilometers (1,860 miles) wide crashing into the early Earth at 19 kilometers per second (12 miles per second). The right-side view shows the mixing of the object and Earth materials after the impact. \nCredit: Southwest Research Institute \n\u201cWe modeled the massive collisions and how metals and silicates were integrated into Earth during this \u2018late accretion stage,\u2019 which lasted for hundreds of millions of years after the Moon formed,\u201d Simone Marchi, a researcher at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Colorado and lead author of a Nature Geoscience paper outlining these results, said in a statement. Marchi worked with Robin Canup, also at SwRI, and Richard Walker, a geologist at the University of Maryland. \n\u201cBased on our simulations, the late-accretion mass delivered to Earth may be significantly greater than previously thought, with important consequences for the earliest evolution of our planet,\u201d Marchi said. \nFollow Nola Taylor Redd at @NolaTRedd, Facebook, or Google+.
