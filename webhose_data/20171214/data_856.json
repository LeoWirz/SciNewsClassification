The 1LE puts down 400-425 rwhp stock, most bolt on mods can get you to 425-480 rwhp. Get into heads/cams and 550rwhp is in range. Add forced induction on top of that and 650rwhp is in range but then you need to worry about hard parts in the engine and maybe even the drivetrain.\nThe ZL1 though, already has 650hp which they are putting down 550rwhp easily. Do the normal bolt on mods (CAI, ported IM/TB, E85, upper supercharger pulley, catless headers and tune) and 700rwhp comes in range fast. Motor is already built for the power and drivetrain is ready for it as well.\nThe 1LE has the ZL1 diff, but not the ZL1 stub axles. I think the transmission is the same in both of them and the clutch is the same so no worries there other than the clutch.\nThe ZL1 A10 auto though is stout and can more than handle the power increase.\nSo it really depends on how reliable you want to be, if this is your only DD then I would be after 100% reliable, but if you are like me and have another vehicle to drive that allows some more flexibility in case something happens.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:34.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f87a83ee8904cb145c54dd57348a3c235ad6948b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSttB_hD1IIFV0WQfwfOfgB88JgD.fA1HIeAST5Ax90omCqtgCT6aKsThJZFZO3xsbMIyosjnlRoL6KhpwrUjLiA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/IOTA", "title": "December is the month of IOTA.", "title_full": "December is the month of IOTA. : Iota", "published": "2017-12-07T10:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 119, "participants_count": 92, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.016, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "64bb6e9b73da0662050a9b555a3b4ea5f064206e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSttB_hD1IIFV0WQfwfOfgB88JgD.fA1HIeAST5Ax90omCqtgCT6aKsThJZFZO3xsbMIyosjnlRoLZMXVun_J0o.WWGIHBFDKNkoGPHeJdE58-", "ord_in_thread": 91, "author": "svej0", "published": "2017-12-07T16:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The first rational post i\u2019ve seen in r/iota sub for a while! expect more downvotes :/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:34.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "640d9fffbfa98b7e48f077e15d6f6dd6a50eb83c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7sZBOjv13UnoYqRkC1lSRBOJA3Se5agvTJ5Tm8CNJIpIW3isCyN44CFRV2OSHgFM-", "site_full": "www.camaro6.com", "site": "camaro6.com", "site_section": "http://www.camaro6.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=155", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "2016 Camaro: 6th Gen Camaro general forum - CAMARO6", "title": "Trade 1LE for ZL1?", "title_full": "Trade 1LE for ZL1? - CAMARO6", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f19ed7e906282b262964b5ff53fe1d1bce106151", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_7sZBOjv13UnoYqRkC1lSRBOJA3Se5agvTJ5Tm8CNJIpIW3isCyN44tmCdcCLMMl_FqSrncuJIBg--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Martinjlm", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Do not trade the 1LE.

"Stroud district one of the best places to grow up in the country according to government report 1 comment \nTHE Stroud district is one of the best places in the country to grow up, according to a government report. \nThe Social Mobility Commission\u2019s annual report, `State of the Nation 2017\u2019 ranks all 324 local authorities in England in terms of the life chances of someone born into a disadvantaged background. \nThe commission claims that Britain is a deeply divided nation, and identifies a growing gap between areas that offer good opportunities for social progress and those that do not. \nStroud ranks 43rd in the list, and is classified as a `hotspot\u2019 \u2013 meaning that disadvantaged children growing up in the Stroud district have a higher chance of escaping poverty than most other areas. \nStroud is the highest performing district in the South West, outranking all its neighbours. \nSouth Gloucestershire ranks 120, Tewkesbury 199, Cotswold 268, Gloucester 282,

such an offbeat, unconventional and interesting career? \nRadha Ramachandran , SM\u201909, hadn\u2019t yet finished her bachelor\u2019s degree in chemical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, but she already knew she was ready for a change in perspective. \n\u201cI wanted to move to pure science,\u201d Ramachandran says. \u201cPhysics is not so different from engineering, but it\u2019s a way of looking at the same problems at a more fundamental level.\u201d \nOriginal Link : \nhttps://mspsd.uchicago.edu/page/ms-psd-alumni-profile-radha-ramachandran-09 \nShe chose the University of Chicago\u2019s Master of Science Program in the Physical Sciences Division to bridge the gap between her engineering degree and the PhD she aimed to pursue. \u201cUChicago was one of the only places that offered a distinct, intensive master\u2019s program in physics,\u201d says Ramachandran, who is now a PhD candidate in the Department of Physics at UChicago. \nPrior to applying for the master\u2019s degree, Ramachandran visited campus and met with the dean of the Division of the Physical Sciences to discuss her interest in the program. He answered her questions and advised her to take the GRE as soon as possible, since she was sure she wanted to pursue the degree. \nTell us about the Master of Science Program at University of Chicago \nThe Master of Science Program in the Physical Sciences Division is a one-year, interdisciplinary program for students who are undecided about pursuing a PhD, who want to strengthen their background before applying to PhD programs, or whose careers could benefit from a year of rigorous scientific research at the graduate level. Offering courses in multiple departments and research tracks, the program provides students a broad education while allowing them to identify a research specialization. \n\u201cI\u2019d done basic research but hadn\u2019t formally taken physics courses during college. UChicago\u2019s master\u2019s program was very flexible, so I could tailor it according to what I wanted to do next. I ended up taking all the first-year courses that PhD students take,\u201d Ramachandran says. \nIn those classes, Ramachandran was able to get a taste of PhD work and collaborate with peers who helped advance her understanding of the material. \n\u201cIt was very interesting taking courses with PhD students. I could gauge for myself where I stood against people who do get into these programs,\u201d Ramachandran says. \u201cI would meet with the PhD students in my classes, and we\u2019d all do problem sets together. It really helped me in thinking through the problems.\u201d \nWhat did you do next? Tell us about your Phd \nRamachandran applied to the physics PhD program as a master\u2019s student and continued her studies directly after earning her first graduate degree. With her first-year requirements out of the way through the master\u2019s program, she could focus on her research earlier than many of her peers. \nShe continued the fruitful research collaboration she had begun with her master\u2019s thesis advisor, Sidney Nagel, studying fluid dynamics as they relate to petroleum excavation. \n\u201cThe nature of the research has changed with more and more experiments. It\u2019s a linear path from the project I started to what I\u2019m doing now, but the focus on the problem has changed,\u201d she says. \nAt UChicago Ramachandran\u2019s perspective is expanding, not only through her research but also in her career outlook. \n\u201cI was really focused on being an academic, but I\u2019m starting to explore other options as well,\u201d Ramachandran says. \u201cMy department brings back alumni from my program with many different kinds of jobs. It\u2019s nice to have that exposure; it has opened me up to many possibilities.\u201d Share this:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ramachandran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "radha ramachandran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phd  ramachandran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sidney nagel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uchicago ramachandran", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "shyam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "physical sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indian institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "physical sciences division", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "master of science program at university of chicago  the master of science program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gre", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:36.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81be65c0d55ee32ebd8a1bd42f2e970537388986", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhTWGG_22SOIVUMcjV.1C_yUijLHiOrGBmy0Ew6uozoOWw6E8q2zfEUVfe3RDUH_jPM_z2NGOCjIcGwY1M1.AUbK3yZR09aVMeLEqkp9pxCDohO9EvJp.5AQrUN0EFMneyCnQIjURjkdQrB6tjRIw5AU35A8vtXdfYvD7u7PY_fec6tRj_9lGRe2KVk2hYKmisCw5_ILpE2N8g--", "site_full": "www.chennaiclassic.com", "site": "chennaiclassic.com", "site_section": "http://www.chennaiclassic.com/feed/1/posts", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "Chennai  - ChennaiClassic.com", "title": "Hiring for School Principal ( Female ), Chennai in Chennai, for Exp. 15 - 25 yrs at Shree Anand Madh (Chennai Job)", "title_full": "Hiring for School Principal ( Female ), Chennai in Chennai, for Exp. 15 - 25 yrs at Shree Anand Madh (Chennai Job)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 64302, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81be65c0d55ee32ebd8a1bd42f2e970537388986", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSm1T92cToJGYEMWPaYhcX5wXo036qFFhTWGG_22SOIVUMcjV.1C_yUijLHiOrGBmy0Ew6uozoOWw6E8q2zfEUVfe3RDUH_jPM_z2NGOCjIcGwY1M1.AUbK3yZR09aVMeLEqkp9pxCDohO9EvJp.5AQrUN0EFMneyCnQIjURjkdQrB6tjRIw5AU35A8vtXdfYvD7u7PY_fec6tRj_9lGRe2KVk2hYKmisCw5_ILpE2N8g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hiring for School Principal ( Female ), Chennai in Chennai, for Exp. 15 - 25 yrs at Shree Anand Madh (Chennai Job)", "text": "Hiring for School Principal ( Female ), Chennai in Chennai, for Exp. 15 - 25 yrs at Shree Anand Madh (Chennai Job) Reply to: (Not Shown) (Please mention ChennaiClassic.com when contacting) Job Description: About School: Shree Anand Madhukar Jain Vidyapeeth is best described as value-driven, holistic school.

With the families of housemates all set to enter the house, things are going to get high on emotions and drama, of course. As already reported by us, Puneesh Sharma\u2019s father, Vikas Gupta\u2019s mother, Shilpa Shinde\u2019s mother and Priyank Sharma \u2019s estranged girlfriend Divya Agarwal will get a chance to meet them and other housemates. And from what we have been told, it\u2019s going to be a really exciting episode with emotions flowing freely, and housemates breaking down at the sight of their loved ones. \nBut the most anticipated meeting for viewers is definitely the one with Divya and Priyank. Sources exclusively told indianexpress.com that it was quite hard-hitting and emotional. Shot yesterday, the task required housemates to remain still in their position, while the family members entered the house. Once they are done communicating with them, Bigg Boss gave the housemates a chance to interact with their loved ones for a couple of minutes before they left the house. Knowing well that things between Priyank and Divya could turn volatile, Bigg Boss did not give a chance for the housemates to interact with her, and rather she only spoke to a freezed Priyank. \nShared the source, \u201cWhen Divya entered the house, Priyank looked happy but his world turned upside down when she started speaking. Divya opened her heart out, on how cheated she felt with his behaviour in the house. She informed him that she has decided to call off their relationship after seeing his closeness with female co-contestants. Priyank started crying hearing it and she too couldn\u2019t hold back her tears. Divya, also took the opportunity to tell Priyank that he doesn\u2019t need a girl\u2019s support (read: Hina Khan ) to win the show. Lastly, she told Priyank that since they found love on national TV, it was only justified that they break up in the same way.\u201d \nWatch video as Priyank Sharma\u2019s girlfriend Divya Agarwal visits Bigg Boss 11 house: . @Divya_Agarwal_ \u2018s words move @ipriyanksharmaa to tears! Watch their emotional melt-down tonight at 10:30 PM. #BB11 #BBSneakPeek pic.twitter.com/sGfoS5cCaL \n\u2014 COLORS (@ColorsTV) December 7, 2017 \nWhile Divya was asked to leave the house post that, Priyank was left miserable and he ran outside in the garden area calling her out. \u201cIt was a sorry sight to see Priyank shouting out \u2018D\u2019 through the walls and wanting to give a clarification. But for Divya, it definitely was a closure she wanted,\u201d added the source. \nApart from Divya, Vikas\u2019 mom\u2019s presence left everyone emotional. While Vikas couldn\u2019t hold himself back and let go his position when he saw his mother, she on her part had a word of advice for everyone. Vikas\u2019 PR Rahul Bharti told indianexpress.com, \u201cHis mother went in the house to mend his relationships. She warmly hugged Shilpa and told her that she has forgiven her for her ill behaviour towards her son and hope they can become friends. She also gave a tight hug to Priyank, who was missing his mom, and told him that she is always there for him. It was a beautiful moment to see her do that for her son. The entire house was left in tears seeing Vikas\u2019 emotional meet with his mom.\u201d \nSee photos as Vikas Gupta meets his mother in the Bigg Boss 11 house: . @lostboy54 cannot express his happiness after seeing his mother in the #BB11 house!

The investment firm highlighted \u201cimpressive\u201d Taobao and Tmall retail platforms, along with an \u201cample runway ahead\u201d for the company\u2019s advertising business. \nJust 15% of merchants on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall and Taobao platforms actively use marketing features, wrote Patil, \u201cpointing to the potential for material upside.\u201d The Susquehanna analysts also see the tech giant benefiting from an expansion of its cloud business and the extension of its global reach outside of China.

The retailer says it may use the proceeds to carry out more acquisitions in growth segments such as physical retail and logistics assets.

dengue vaccination effort amid the surprising results of a new study conducted by the vaccine's manufacturer. On Wednesday, French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi Pasteur published clinical trial data showing that its dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, could have unintended consequences in patients who had never been infected with the mosquito-borne virus. \"The analysis confirmed that Dengvaxia provides persistent (protective) benefit against dengue fever in those who had prior infection,\" Sanofi said in a statement . \"For those not previously infected by dengue virus, however, the analysis found that in the longer term, more cases of severe disease could occur following vaccination upon a subsequent dengue infection.\" New dengue vaccine could instead cause more cases, experts warn On Monday, Harry Roque Jr., a spokesman for Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, announced that the Department of Justice would launch an investigation into the fast-track approval of Dengvaxia by the previous administration. Assistant Health Secretary Lyndon Lee Suy said his agency would work with the Department of Education to monitor all recipients of the vaccine for adverse health effects. \"We will leave no stone unturned in making those responsible for this shameless public health scam which puts hundreds of thousands of young lives at risk accountable,\" Roque said Sunday . In a statement, Sanofi said it would \"continue to seek constructive and transparent dialogue\" with the Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://pcoo.gov.ph/news_releases/palace-doj-starts-dengvaxia-probe-doh-monitor-recipients/", "https://pcoo.gov.ph/news_releases/presidential-spokesperson-dengvaxia-anomaly/", "http://www.sanofipasteur.com/en/Documents/PDF/PR/20171130_Sanofi-Updates-Info-on-Dengue-Vaccine_EN.pdf", "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/04/health/dengue-fever-vaccine-dengvaxia-philippines-intl/index.html?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fzen.yandex.com", "http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/01/health/dengue-vaccine-increase-disease/index.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry roque jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyndon lee suy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodrigo duterte", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanofi pasteur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "food and drug administration of the philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of education", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanofi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dengvaxia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:37.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3558d1dbb28c1cee075a08afd047bd21abf3c0bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qPdfdiPqv7qDWZhjeycEm2c410uM5g3.vZxFX1O8IbkFb_Ps0sDjZJoxs.fOdQ62SVkD2f2181EU90gWCXmI4Fgt_ahC81VrsBkb8388hSvtIyMgg3Rvvbe", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Judge sends VW manager to prison for 7 years in diesel scam | The Indian Express", "title_full": "Judge sends VW manager to prison for 7 years in diesel scam | The Indian Express", "published": "2017-12-07T14:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.305, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/volkswagen-7591.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3558d1dbb28c1cee075a08afd047bd21abf3c0bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qPdfdiPqv7qDWZhjeycEm2c410uM5g3.vZxFX1O8IbkFb_Ps0sDjZJoxs.fOdQ62SVkD2f2181EU90gWCXmI4Fgt_ahC81VrsBkb8388hSvtIyMgg3Rvvbe", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ie Online", "published": "2017-12-07T14:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "Judge sends VW manager to prison for 7 years in diesel scam | The Indian Express", "text": "Rajasthan labourer hacked: Accused claimed murder in name of rescuing woman, she denies link \nA judge on Wednesday sentenced a Volkswagen senior manager to seven years in prison for covering up a scheme to evade pollution limits on US diesel vehicles, calling it an astonishing fraud on American consumers. Oliver Schmidt, who is the second person to be sent to prison over the scandal, was dispatched to the US from Germany in 2015 to meet with suspicious California regulators. But he didn\u2019t disclose rogue software that had long fooled authorities into believing that VW was meeting emissions rules on nearly 600,000 vehicles. He also misled American investigators and destroyed documents. \n\u201cI\u2019m sure, based upon common sense, that you viewed this cover-up as an opportunity to shine to climb the corporate ladder at VW,\u201d US District Judge Sean Cox said. \u201cYour goal was to impress senior management.\u201d \nThe judge called Schmidt, who had led VW\u2019s engineering and environmental office in Michigan for three years, a \u201ckey conspirator\u201d in the deception. \n\u201cWithout trust in corporate America,\u201d Cox said, \u201cthe economy can\u2019t function.\u201d \nThe diesel vehicles were programmed to trigger certain pollution results only during testing, not during regular road use. The plan was hatched in 2006, and the vehicles were marketed as \u201cclean diesel.\u201d Justice Department prosecutor Ben Singer called it the \u201cheight of irony.\u201d \nSchmidt, 48, was arrested in Miami in January while trying to return to Germany after a vacation. He\u2019s been in custody without bond. \n\u201cFor the disruption of my life, I only have to blame myself. \u2026 I accept the responsibility for the wrong I committed,\u201d Schmidt told the judge. \nEngineer James Liang cooperated with the FBI and was sentenced to 40 months in prison last summer. Six others at VW or Audi were charged, but they are in Germany and out of reach of US authorities. Among them is Heinz-Jakob Neusser, who was described as Schmidt\u2019s boss. He was head of engine development and, later, VW brand development. \nVW pleaded guilty as a corporation in March and agreed to pay $4.3 billion in civil and criminal penalties on top of billions more to buy back cars. \nSchmidt\u2019s lawyer, David DuMouchel, argued that his sentence should be identical to Liang\u2019s, noting that his role only heated up in 2015 in the last months of the scheme. But Singer noted that Schmidt still was a major player at key events and purposely \u201clied and deceived.\u201d \n\u201cHe could have made a lot of different choices,\u201d Singer said.

Over the holiday, Amazon noted strong sales of its branded hardware at Whole Foods locations. In this way, consumers could start to see an apparel section, a pharmacy, and other non-food products being sold at the organic food retailer. Largest Ever Total Available Market \nInstinet\u2019s Simeon Siegel and team, noting that Amazon may already be the biggest apparel retailer, expect sales to boom between $45 billion and $85 billion by fiscal 2020.

Interacting with the media for the first time in nearly 10 months, Sharjeel claimed that the punishment of five years ban handed out to him by the PCB anti-corruption tribunal was unjust and that he would appeal the ban in the courts now. \n\u201cI swear by God that I am innocent and that I didn\u2019t accept any offer to spot-fix. I have fully cooperated with the PCB throughout this case and I expected justice from them. I am sorry to say the PCB tribunal unfairly tried to implicate me in the case,\u201d Sharjeel said. The left-handed opener was handed a five-year ban \u2014 half of it suspended by the tribunal in September, while a full five-year ban and one million rupees fine was imposed on another batsman, Khalid Latif in the PSL fixing case. \nSharjeel appealed the ban with an independent adjudicator of the PCB but it was dismissed last month. He said now he had no option left but to approach the High court for justice. \u201cI also appeal to the Prime Minister, Army Chief and Chief Justice to look into my case and help me in getting justice,\u201d Sharjeel said. \nAs expected the pleadings of Sharjeel and his intention to approach the High court has not gone down well with the PCB which is expected to release an official statement shortly. \u201cIt is nothing but a ploy to gain sympathy. The tribunal found him guilty on all charges of the anti-corruption code. He was provided with a transparent process to clear his name. But he was found guilty,\u201d a PCB official said. \nHe said the PCB didn\u2019t expect Sharjeel to react this way. Sharjeel also claimed that there appeared to be some hidden agenda behind banning him and he hoped the truth would come out soon. \u201cThe punishment handed out to me has not only been painful for me and my family but also for my well wishers and supporters. I will take every step to clear my name and stage a comeback,\u201d he added. \nHis lawyer, Shaighan Ejaz confirmed they didn\u2019t accept the PCB decisions as the board had produced on evidence to support the ban on his client. \u201cWe will shortly be filing a petition in the High court although the PCB quietly amended a clause in their anti-corruption code which says we can now only take our case to the international court of arbitration for sports in Switzerland,\u201d Ejaz said. \u201cWhile the tribunal announced its decision on August 30, 2017, the changes were made in Article 7 of the Code on July 28, 2017 which says that spot-fixing convicts aren\u2019t allowed to file a writ against the decision before any Pakistani court and only before the CAS in Switzerland.\u201d \nEjaz said Sharjeel was not in a position to afford the heavy expenses involved in filing the appeal with the CAS and would seek justice from Pakistani courts. The lawyer claimed neither the tribunal nor the lawyers were informed about the change in the clause by the PCB which showed malafide intention from them. \nSharjeel also insisted that the head of the PCB\u2019s anti-corruption unit, Colonel Azam Khan had forced him to confess to the crime to face less punishment. \u201cHe told me either I do it or forget about playing cricket again.\u201d   More Top News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sharj", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sharjeel khan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "khalid latif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shaighan ejaz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "azam khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ejaz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharjeel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pcb", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psl", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharjeel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:19:38.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a40fc0167b02033b314d097792a4a58a60ccfcb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmPJr73mbL6mqEM.XF4J_9OH61kvkopg0OGXIk5zVU6D5O6EvZb8e.r_A0eBlr.7hhhCHVgr3qHVaLLFIdztmUdQk6s8GzTeHI-", "site_full": "reason.com", "site": "reason.com", "site_section": "http://reason.com/people/ed-krayewski/all.xml", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "media"], "section_title": "Ed Krayewski: Reason.com articles and blog posts.", "title": "Trump Calls on Saudi Arabia to End Yemen Blockade, Bipartisan Majority in House Rejects Trump Impeachment Effort, ;August Ames Dead: P.M.
