I think that we are in a \"one size fits all\" place unless we stumble upon something special.\nSo 9/1 is what is generally offered for 650s these days. I can't say I noticed any difference, with my fairly std engine.\nHowever, yours is not std, and the question of actual compression ratio is interesting, considering we're chasing ghosts.\nI don't know if any piston supplier really checks the CR of their piston in a real situation (I have my doubts) but instead just gives a rough higher or lower number based on comparison with a std piston.\nSignificant variations in true compression can derive from such variables as cylinder base gasket, head gasket, head skimming, valve sunkeness.\nThe way to measure combustion chamber volume is to lay the bike over such that the plug hole is vertical, at TDC valves closed, slowly fill the chamber from an accurate burette till the oil is at the bottom of the plug hole. That is the only important measurement, everything else can be calculated. It is not the volume of the head hemisphere upside down that you need to know.\n #717896 - Yesterday at 09:30 AM Re: Bonnie Carb Jetting help needed [ Re: BrettF ] Joined: Jan 2014\nPosts: 304 BrettF\n BrettF\n Jan 2014\nPosts: 304\nGeneva, Switzerland Hi Folks, got a sunny day and managed to get a ride in (those of the more eagle-eyed persuasion might notice the snow in the back of some photos).\nThose of the less eagle-eyed persuasion will also have no trouble noting that I disobeyed the cardinal rule: \u201conly change one thing at a time\u201d. With one or two days of riding left and motivated by an urge to prevent my engine detonating itself to death, I fixed everything I could and then did a test, figuring I don\u2019t really care what it was as long as its fixed...\nSo to briefly summarise the situation up to this test:\n- Changed carbs to new premier ones (old ones had sticking slides and were running very rich)\n- Carb had same jetting as before (190 mains, 106 jets and standard pilots, #3 slides)\n- Engine idles beautifully with new carbs\n- With new carbs engine running hot and lean - plugs (especially right one) showed traces of detonation\n- Engine dies if snapped open from idle\n- Double checked tappets \u2013 all spot on.\n- Triple checked timing \u2013 found timing was 2 degrees retarded (running 36 degrees at max advance)\n- Checked for intake manifold leaks \u2013 possibly found warped bowls \u2013 fixed this.\n- Checked fuel level \u20137 mm. I adjusted the floats to be level with the top of the bowl which gives about 7mm fuel height from top of bowl. (Seemingly the highest possible level achievable with stayups).\nSo after all that I decided to make sure the baseline was OK and try to set everything as rich as possible to get it to run rich at which point I could dial things back to normal mixture from a safe starting point. (Spoiler - I was only partially successful).\nI did the following:\n- Adjusted carbs with vacuum gauges (found my throttle stops were out by about \u00bc of a turn based on the \u201cpoint where the screw just touches the slide\u201d). Not a big deal either way though. slides move all the way up into the body.\n- Retarded timing to 35 degrees for the hell of it, just in case\n- Installed 230 main jets for the hell of it, just to make sure I\u2019m starting from a rich place at all carb operating points\n- Kept needles at highest position (bottom clip slot) for richest running\n- Taped carb flange with masking tape to avoid any chance of air leak there\n- Taped up carb lid and cable inlets with masking tape to avoid any chance of air leak\n- Drained and refilled tank with 100 Octane shell V power\n- Adjusted idle air screw down to about 1 turn out for right carbs and 1.25 out for left carb (point where RPM stopped increasing)\n- New B8ES plugs gapped at .025\u201d\n- My IR thermometer packed up on the last test new one not yet arrived so was guessing relative temps through the sizzle test\n- Put some copper anti-seize grease on the plug threads, you can sometimes see it on the plugs if it touched the surroundings when I removed them- ignore that.\nWarmed her up and then went for a short ride:\n- The problem of bike dying if throttle snapped open was still there. Turned the air/idle screw in a bit on both but it seemed to make no difference.\n- 1st ride was pottering around at openings up to a half throttle getting to the test stretch of road. Plugs are new and very little carbon but OK for about 5 km ride I guess. Right still looks leaner than left.\n- 2nd run at around \u00bd to \u00be throttle. Right plug looks ok but lean-ish while left looks ok but rich- ish.\n- 3rd run at WOT: Both plugs look significantly leaner than the previous run with the ceramic becoming very white again. As before right looks leaner than left\n- Final run was getting back home \u2013 pottering around again at lower throttle opening \u2013 Plugs now very rich, porcelain on the left plug is completely black while the porcelain on the right plug is being covered by carbon but the white from the WOT run is still visible so it is \"blacking up\" more slowly. This is expected from the rich idle air screw settings.\nThings I noticed on the run,\n-heads were on hot side (sizzling) while the right seemed hotter than left (more sizzle ;-)) as one would expect from the plugs\n-Bike definitely had less power- probably due to timing being more retarded, was easier to maintain WOT this time around during tests. Previously speeds got a bit hairy.\n- for both carbs there is not really a point where the engine slows when turning out the idle screw (too lean) past 1.5 turns. It does however slow when tuned inwards (too rich) less than about 3/4 turns.\nIt seems as though the problem is still there, although attenuated; seemingly still very present at WOT. I was very surprised by this with the 230 Main jets installed. I was expecting evidence of 8 stroking but instead, I still have lean running at the top. While at the same time bike dying on acceleration off idle...\nI'm leaning towards swapping the carbs and air filters (left for right) next year to see if the problem follows the carbs or stays with the pistons. I wonder if I should get a couple of 240 or 250 main jets just for the hell of it although I might just drill out a pair of old jets to ensure that I can actually get it to run rich at WOT, or I coul djust run without mains to make sure the needle circuit is not limiting. I'm going to double check the carb throat, make sure its, in fact, 30mm (is there a specific way to check this?). I'm considering using the old carbs with known good needle jets as a reference but the throttle sticking issue I had on them (reason for the change) is putting me off from testing it, but seeing as I'm making little progress I might give it a try. I never did do plug chops at different throttle openings on that set-up. Just rode it as I got it and checked plugs occasionally after use. were always black/sooty, I know this does not say much though...\nAny ideas or comments greatly appreciated\n3D TV: A format that lost a format war without even having an opponent.\nBikes:\n69 T120 on average (1967 rolling frame and 1971 Bonnie engine)\n57 T110 on average (58 rolling frame - with 55 iron head engine)\n#717906 - Yesterday at 12:21 PM Re: Bonnie Carb Jetting help needed [ Re: BrettF ] Joined: Dec 2006\nPosts: 3,856 btour\n btour\n Dec 2006\nPosts: 3,856\nMassachusetts, U.S.A. Brett,\nI think the idea is get a picture angle more like the top pair of photos. You want to see the porcelain that is more inside the plug. The plug is drawing heat from the head. Yes the aluminium balls will show on the tip, but deeper inside can read the heat. Shadows are a problem.\nIt would seem the new carbs made a difference.\nAre those the extended plugs?\nThere seems to be a difference between putzing in the top photo and putzing in the bottom.\nLast edited by btour; Yesterday at 12:25 PM .

Your get 'er done attitude and clever approach will win in the end.\nHowever, looking at the results I see, it appears to be an almost impossible collection of evidence. Off hand I'd say that your carburetor was way too rich on the low end and way too lean on the mains.\nBut, I find it hard to accept that it actually could be considering the settings you have.\nI would be looking at float levels again. I really looks like the carbs are set up too lean, but flooding at low speeds.\nAlso, be aware that if your particular motor doesn't like 35 degrees advance it will run hot and may even give false rich readings on the plugs. Less advance means less time to burn fuel and some won't be burned and will end up on your plug as soot.\nIf it was my bike, I would be doing all this work running pump gas which is a known factor. The unknown factor is the fuel. What is it? How does it perform in other similar bikes?\nCheers,\nBill\nLast edited by HawaiianTiger; Yesterday at 07:14 PM .

I'll try it in the right carb to see if makes any difference at WOT. If not I'll just take the main jets out all together. Tomorrow is last day before the real snow. Hopefully I can get a short run in.\nThe dying when snapping open off idle might have been due to richness all along rather than leanness... I wondered why choke made no difference. Or maybe it was caused by lean mixture previously and now by rich... Starting to see the attraction of fuel injection!\nBtour, not sure what you mean by extended plug?\nI think the early chop was on brand new plugs hence little carbon. Later had more running time.\nLast edited by BrettF; Yesterday at 09:02 PM . 3D TV: A format that lost a format war without even having an opponent.\nBikes:\n69 T120 on average (1967 rolling frame and 1971 Bonnie engine)\n57 T110 on average (58 rolling frame - with 55 iron head engine)\n#717961 - Yesterday at 09:25 PM Re: Bonnie Carb Jetting help needed [ Re: BrettF ] Joined: Mar 2005\nPosts: 9,991 John Healy\nJohn Healy\nJoined: Mar 2005\nPosts: 9,991\nBoston, Massachusetts Quote: Interesting point on the fuel, reminded need me me that our European octane is about 5 higher than the north american octane so my 100 would be your 95-ish (I believe).\nThe US number is referred to as the anti-knock index (AKI). It is the Research octane number plus the Motor octane number/ divided by two. You see on the US pumps R+M/2.\nThe number referred to in the owners manual and what is on UK pumps, and what used to be on the US pumps: the Research number.\nWith the AKI the Research number is always higher than the Motor number. A fuel rated as 91 AKI will typically have a Research octane number of about 96 while the Motor number of around 87 - 88.\nSo as far as the Research number is concerned a 96 # in the UK, would typically be equivalent with a US AKI # of 91\nResearch octane number is determined in a variable compression single cylinder engine running ay 600 rpm. The air intake is set at 125\u00b0F.\nMotor octane number is determined in the same engine running at 900 rpm. The air intake is set at 300\u00b0F.\nWhen it comes to detonation, the Motor octane (the lower number) is the more severe test and is the number you want higher higher - Yes, it is counter intuitive.\nAlmost as important when it comes to detonation is the volatility of the fuel. As the incoming fuel vaporizes it cools the air. Also a well vaporized air/fuel mixture burns better leaving little, if any, \"end gas\" responsible for detonation.\nA lot of fuels with the same AKI listed on the pump do not vaporize as well as others. Sometimes you will find a lower grade AKI will ping less than one with a higher AKI. There is more to all this than the AKI octane numbers on the pump. Trying different brands, and grades , to see which works better in your bike is definitely in order!\nLast edited by John Healy; Yesterday at 09:34 PM . #717962 - Yesterday at 09:43 PM Re: Bonnie Carb Jetting help needed [ Re: BrettF ] Joined: Mar 2005\nPosts: 9,991 John Healy\nJohn Healy\nJoined: Mar 2005\nPosts: 9,991\nBoston, Massachusetts Quote: Interesting point on the fuel, reminded need me me that our European octane is about 5 higher than the north american octane so my 100 would be your 95-ish (I believe).\nNo, see above!\nQuote: The dying when snapping open off idle might have been due to richness all along rather than leanness.\nDying, as in no sound from combustion, is a classic lean symptom.

You must use a new plug for each \"plug chop\". You must be prepared to remove the threaded portion of teh plug in a lathe or such to expose the porcelain. Then you have to compare what you see with what you have experienced in the past. Smokey Yunik, who made plug reading a science, had every plug he had ever ran in his race cars. They included extensive notes as to the tuning and the results of the race.\n#717963 - Yesterday at 09:48 PM Re: Bonnie Carb Jetting help needed [ Re: BrettF ] Joined: Jun 2007\nPosts: 5,509 HawaiianTiger\n HawaiianTiger\n Jun 2007\nPosts: 5,509\nMaui Hawaii 20 years ago I lived in SoCal where we had the distinction of being the lab rats for the petroleum industry. There was a lot of fuss when they first introduced ethanol to the fuel. Octane ratings went down. Marginally tuned motors suffered immediately and others had problems ei. when climbing some notable grades in the area, like the\nGrapevine.\nWhere before we could get away with running regular leaded gas, only the higher priced fuels would work.\nBefore long, all my vehicles needed the best fuel available at the pumps.\nAdapt or die....\nSo, along with some folks I worked with, we developed methods to get the most out of the fuels available without resorting to mixing sport gas or avgas to them. We didn't go so far as to adopt twin plug heads. That wasn't an appropriate solution for our vehicles.\nI dropped the compression ratio on the bike I rode the most and suffered with the loss of power. Bummer.\nThen I started to harden the combustion chambers in order to help with pinging and possibly detonation.\nIt works well enough to allow these bikes to run with the original timing figures. Well most of them, anyway. There's always one in the crowd that misbehaves...\nFast forward a decade or so. The same stuff happened here. I was living on Kauai at the time and when they started adding ethanol to the fuel there was absolutely no warning as to what to expect. A number of fishing boats got stranded and the coast guard had to rescue them. The local marine mechanics made bank changing fishing boat motors and fuel tanks to ethanol tolerant ones.\nMy Norton fiberglass tank melted in my garage, totally gumming up my carbs and inlet tracks. It took me several months to sort out all of that.\nDon't expect the petroleum industry to warn you about what they're up to. That was a hard lesson.\n74Commando01 by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/152305986@N08/][/url], on Flickr\nCheers,\nBill\nLast edited by HawaiianTiger; Yesterday at 09:50 PM .

Brett,\nNGK makes a plug that has an extended nose. It extends a bit more into the combustion chamber. The idea was that would create better combustion. Lest I think that was the idea. ( You see my bike was smoking. The cause of that, I found out here later from reading John Healy's posts) was a too small washer under the inner head bolts. A well known design flaw on some years. ) But before that, Al jr. took my brand new champions, and threw them in the trash and put in the extended NGK's. That was shortly before it blew a piston apart. Just saying. He is another know it all Triumph mechanic.(sarcasm) One who fixes out of shape carbs with emory paper and swears he is right. He probably also skims heads. I have seen him do the former. And let his kid over tighten carbs with the wrong spacer and strip primary oil plugs. Oh the pain of it all. Aghast.\nI am looking at the E, in your NGK's and wondering, if that was the plug. I still have one around somewhere I think, in my bag of junk from the explosion. You got to see the piston. I know where that is. Broken rod too.\nNot that I think the extended plug did it. But who knows right? I just use the Champions. Breakfast of Wheaties. Or is that backwards?\nLast edited by btour; 8 hours ago .

Its like you turn off the key!\nYes, that is exactly how it happens, turn throttle slightly more slowly and revs up fine, snap open fast and it dies as you describe. The only way I can make the carbs still richer is going to a larger pilot + cutout. I might go to a 3 groove pilot just to see what happens (pilots are expensive but cheaper then slides) after I've run it without mains to make sure there is no other limiting factor.\nMr Tiger, float level would really seem a likely candidate. If I don't get any joy elsewhere Ill take up AMAL on their kind offer over the winter to check out the fact that I can't seem to get the level into the \"specified range\" with the supplied kit.\nWhat is doing my head in is the consistent difference between the carbs after all this fiddling.\nIf anyone has experience/recommendations on European fuels that will be very interesting.\nthis is the fuel I use.

The move comes amid an ongoing campaign to improve the environment and tackle soil pollution, according to Reuters. \nChina has already withdrawn 22 of what the nation classifies as highly toxic pesticides from farm use, and it prohibits the use of any such products on fruit, vegetables and tea. An agriculture ministry official from China says there are still many toxic chemicals in use on other crops, while calling for more research and development to produce highly-effective alternatives with low toxicity. \nBeijing announced two years ago a goal to achieve zero growth in the amount of pesticides used by 2020, and says it has already seen negative growth over the last three years. \u00a9 2017 Nebraska Rural Radio Association.

There were a lot of different things, and while some of them maybe have worked.. looking back, a lot of it seemed pretty cheesy. \nBut good news! I have something new to share with you. I was so excited when I was asked to review a new cool sampler pack of child evangelism tools. I\u2019d never considered getting something like this for the kids, and this was a great start. The sampler pack I received is filled with a few things that you could buy more of, to give you an idea of what everything is like. It\u2019s the perfect little starter. \nThese are really cool. They are wordless bracelets (one is a silicone bracelet and the other is a kit). Each colour represents a different idea and the children are encouraged to look at the different colours when praying. It\u2019s a really great visually appealing way to remember God\u2019s love for us. \nI really liked these. You fold them over and over and they tell a story. It\u2019s a fun thing that kids can do by themselves to learn Bible verses. These ones were a lot of fun to use. \nThese are pop up books, and we really liked using these as well. My toddler enjoyed looking at and seeing the popups, but my younger son was a bit too young for it. As my daughter is getting older, she\u2019s less likely to rip the pop ups out, which makes them more fun. These were great stories as well. \nI don\u2019t think I super got these. They were interesting, for sure, but not something I would use with my little ones. Maybe if they were a bit older it would have worked better. \nOverall, I really enjoyed this sampler pack. The container it came in was great for my daughter to open and close herself, and we enjoyed reading through all the stories together. \nIf you\u2019re interested in getting your own, check out their link here ! \nxoxo,", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:24.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8834c5f6d55e53beaff475b9ecf2a12a447e300", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz_2WCFUvvxVUHwbOHKl3RovuqtFCAHMileTzLAILdV_iyIHMXKtUDGywPBdTTJdLG4gsnzAYebzQyTfn5DjYCIRAWkguLCeMDFTvZkrYJveQ--", "site_full": "freekabalance.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://freekabalance.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Ka Balance", "title": "Eveready 18-Litre Microwave Oven (OTG)", "title_full": "Eveready 18-Litre Microwave Oven (OTG)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f8834c5f6d55e53beaff475b9ecf2a12a447e300", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz_2WCFUvvxVUHwbOHKl3RovuqtFCAHMileTzLAILdV_iyIHMXKtUDGywPBdTTJdLG4gsnzAYebzQyTfn5DjYCIRAWkguLCeMDFTvZkrYJveQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Freekabalance Blog (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "title": "Eveready 18-Litre Microwave Oven (OTG)", "text": "\n\nFlipkart has Eveready 18-Litre Microwave Oven (OTG) on sale.\nHow to get this deal Click  View Deal button button Add the Eveready 18-Litre Microwave Oven (OTG)  to cart No Coupon Code required Make Payment of Rs. 3699 Enjoy Free Shipping \nDetails Buy Eveready 18-Litre Microwave Oven (OTG) at Rs. 3699 from Flipkart Free Shipping \n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "otg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flipkart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flipkart free shipping", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:24.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8234929fb0b0378839cef8903ebf5737e968ea9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVApD4O0EWvHlX7YKjkqQqJTA5frvDJBM.Qcz5ZqNsBXHv8HaPPkIFmpSrbDNX706bWfEn5RQbg69gbhw2zjPBk5So9t_QixrmuCL6pZirodb_9KuBa7zoo-", "site_full": "www.expedia.es", "site": "expedia.es", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.es/Jerome-Hoteles.d119566.Guia-Viajes-Hoteles", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "110 Hoteles en Jerome, Sedona baratos con Expedia.es", "title": "Sedona Summit Resort by Diamond Resorts (Sedona,", "title_full": "Sedona Summit Resort by Diamond Resorts (Sedona, Estados Unidos) | Expedia.es", "published": "2017-09-23T22:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26131, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "72a6bfe47a46695721d04cb83b587a32a739b3da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVApD4O0EWvHlX7YKjkqQqJTA5frvDJBM.Qcz5ZqNsBXHv8HaPPkIFmpSrbDNX706bWfEn5RQbg69gbhw2zjPBk5So9t_QixrmuCL6pZirodYA3XHaFsW3sasIiPETaxockhML9SVdGJSSol1EdIRxhOTkUZjy0pTA--", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-17T23:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Upon check in at midnight, the person gave us a room number and building number that did not exist.

Asked if there were any similarities between Sam Smith and Luther Vandross, LaBelle said: There are voices in this world and once they sing it\u2019s a stamp on everybody. Luther did that and he\u2019s done it. The talk went on to explore the friendship between LaBelle and Vandross, and while the latter\u2019s sexuality has always been a cause for debate, Cohen asked if he ever struggled with coming out publicly. He said: Did [Vandross] struggle with the idea of coming out publicly? Was that something that you talked about at all? LaBelle said it was discussed, but Vandross had a lot of \u201clady fans,\u201d and he didn\u2019t want to upset the world. She said: We talked about it.

We trust our little gray cells to do the work of making sure we stick to the straight-and-narrow path while we are trying to reach our personal and financial goals. \nThe problem is that our bodies have an impressive ability to sabotage all the good intentions of our brains. Before you assume that your cerebellum is up to the task of resisting your body's sabotage, remember that the following things can crush even the strongest of good intentions into dust. (See also: 5 Mental Biases That Are Keeping You Poor ) Hunger saps your willpower \nThose candy bar commercials are quite right when they point out that you're not you when you're hungry. While everyone has experienced the irritability associated with being a little \"hangry,\" what you might not realize is that your low blood sugar is also depleting your ability to withstand temptation. \nAccording to a 2007 self-control study by Matthew T. Gailliot and Roy F. Baumeister, your ability to exert self-discipline depends partially on your blood-glucose levels. This is the sort of thing that feels obvious when you go grocery shopping on an empty stomach, since you're feeling tempted by the very thing you lack. However, the relationship between self-discipline and blood-glucose levels is also behind your struggle to avoid other types of temptations. That's because, according to the researchers, \"self-control requires a certain amount of glucose to operate unimpaired.\" \nThis is why it's much harder to avoid making impulse purchases when you're hungry. For instance, I recently forgot to grab a snack for myself right before taking my son to his weekly swim lesson. While I waited by the pool with my stomach rumbling, I found myself purchasing two new audiobooks from Audible on my phone, despite my commitment to refrain from spending more money on audiobooks. My willpower was destroyed by my hunger pangs. \nThat's why I try to always carry a piece of fruit or other complex carbohydrate with me while I'm out. (That, and you wouldn't like my kids when they are hangry.) Having a quick snack can often nip temptations in the bud before they have a chance to disrupt your good financial intentions. Lack of sleep impairs your judgment \nWe've all known the fuzzy feeling in our heads after an all-nighter. Since the wooziness disappears once you've gotten some sleep, we all tend to ignore the effects of sleeplessness since they are relatively short lived. After all, no one goes for days on end without sleep. \nUnfortunately, sleep deprivation has a much bigger effect on your cognitive abilities than you might realize. A 2000 study by A.M. Williamson and Anne-Marie Feyer found that going without sleep for 20 or more hours straight makes a person perform tasks as if they had a blood alcohol level of 0.1 percent, which is 0.02 percent over the legal limit for driving under the influence. The study was looking at how non-sleepers do while performing tasks requiring both speed and accuracy \u2014 such as the tasks necessary to drive a car. \nOf course, most people are not going without sleep for 20 hours. However, even a built-up sleep deficit accumulated by regularly getting only four or five hours of sleep per night can affect your mental acuity. In a 2006 interview with The Harvard Business Review , Dr. Charles A. Czeisler, the Baldino Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School wrote, \"[if you] average four hours of sleep a night for four or five days, [you] develop the same level of cognitive impairment as if [you'd] been awake for 24 hours.\" \nSo what does this mean for your financial goals? Nothing good, I'm afraid. Your ability to make rational financial decisions is also seriously impaired when your mental acuity is suffering from sleep deprivation. Your sleep-deprived brain is less able to fulfill the sorts of executive functions necessary to predict outcomes and perceive the consequences of actions \u2014 which means you are more likely to make poor financial decisions when you are exhausted. Arousal can erode your moral compass \nYou might believe that your morality is an integral part of who you are, but behavioral economists have shown that our belief systems can be thwarted when our bodies want something. With a racy experiment, author and researcher Dan Ariely demonstrated in his book Predictably Irrational that our commitment to various strongly-held beliefs decreases when we are in a state of sexual arousal. \nAriely's experiment asked college-aged men how they felt about issues like fairness, gender equality, and safe sex. During the control \"cold\" state, these young men expressed commitment to moral, ethical, and responsible behavior. But after being exposed to sexual imagery, and entering into what scientists call a \"hot\" state, their beliefs were much more malleable. \nThis malleability of beliefs is not confined to sexual arousal. The hot-cold empathy gap is the name for this change in behavior due to any number of bodily needs. The empathy gap describes the way in which it is difficult for someone who is not currently experiencing something like hunger, pain, or sexual arousal to recognize how much these states can affect their decisions. For instance, in a separate study, respondents in a 2003 survey were much likelier to rate thirst rather than hunger as the most unpleasant aspect of being lost in the woods if the respondents had just finished a cardio workout and were therefore thirsty. If they had not yet started their workout, the respondents rated hunger as being more unpleasant. \nThis kind of empathy gap is the reason why we often wrongly predict that we will be able to resist temptation in the moment. When we are not currently faced with a temptation, we imagine ourselves as being the most rational and moral version of ourselves. But feeling hunger, pain, arousal, thirst, or other overwhelming bodily needs weakens our commitments to good behavior. \nIn terms of your finances, that means an overwhelming thirst (or other need) could prompt you to spend money you had no intention of spending. Outwitting your body \nThe good news is that just because our bodies do have the ability to override our brains, we are still smarter than our impulses. The trick is to recognize that you are not always the best version of yourself, and plan ahead for those moments. \nCarry snacks with you to make sure your blood-glucose level doesn't drop to finance-sabotaging depths. Make sure you get adequate sleep, and hide your credit cards when you know you'll have a few nights of sleeplessness. Assume that you're going to be the worst version of yourself when you're in pain, aroused, hungry, thirsty, or craving sugar. If you recognize that you'll have trouble avoiding temptation in those states, it's easier to structure activities so that you don't come into contact with temptations during those times at all. \nThe most disciplined and intelligent savers aren't necessarily better at exerting willpower. They just know that they won't always be perfect, and they plan ahead for when their bodies, rather than their brains, are behind the wheel.

However in all fairness, most large studios, including Paramount, Universal, Sony, and Fox are just distribution companies now and have been for decades. That is how Hollywood has done business for like 30 years. Click to expand... While I agree Frozen was a \"hit\", it is certainly not a quality film from a critical standpoint...I won't bore you with all that I find wrong with it here...but just know its soundtrack (and maybe Olaf) is the sole reason it is the blockbuster it was. And yet, one could also directly tie its success into the bringing on board of JL and co. post-Pixar merger...\nYes, I am being a stickler here.\nFurthermore though, I think Disney (and yes, Hollywood at large) has delved headlong into the franchise mentality. Meaning that nothing can simply exist as a stand-alone film (something Walt was strictly against), and MUST have sequels and spinoffs galore. That I will grant you, is keeping with the times. But again, at a moment when Disney could have shown themselves to be (for lack of a better term) \"different\" than other Hollywood machines, they continue to play the game and cash their nice bonus checks along the way.

In the holy city itself, prayers at Islam's third-holiest site dispersed largely without incident, but Palestinians clashed with Israeli troops in several dozen West Bank hotspots and on the border with the Gaza Strip. Israeli warplanes struck Hamas military targets in the Gaza Strip Friday in response to a rocket fired from the zone that Israel's military said was intercepted by its Iron Dome missile-defense system. The Palestinian health ministry said at least 15 people were injured in Friday's air strikes. Earlier, a 30-year-old Gaza man was killed by Israeli gunfire, the first death of a protester since Trump's dramatic midweek announcement. Two Palestinians were seriously wounded, health officials said. Dozens of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza were hit by live rounds or rubber-coated steel or inhaled tear gas, the officials said. Trump's pivot on Jerusalem triggered warnings from America's friends and foes alike that he is needlessly stirring more conflict in an already volatile region. The religious and political dispute over Jerusalem forms the emotional core of the Israeli-Arab conflict. The ancient city is home to major Muslim, Jewish and Christian shrines and looms large in the competing national narratives of Israelis and Palestinians. Trump's decision on Jerusalem is widely seen in the region as a blatant expression of pro-Israel bias, but it was unclear if protests and confrontations would maintain momentum after Friday. More extensive violence has erupted in the Palestinian areas in the past, including deadly bloodshed triggered by disputes over Jerusalem. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah movement and other groups had called for three \"days of rage\" this week. However, Abbas remains an opponent of violence, saying it's counterproductive and that he might at some point order his security forces to contain protests. Separately, Fatah's rival, the Gaza-based Islamic militant Hamas, called this week for a third uprising against Israel, but such appeals have fizzled as Palestinians become more disillusioned with their leaders. On Friday, demonstrators in the West Bank torched heaps of tires, sending columns of thick black smoke rising over the cities of Ramallah and Bethlehem. Palestinian stone-throwers traded volleys in the streets with soldiers firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Along the Gaza-Israel border fence, Israeli troops fired at stone-throwers. Across the region - from Asia's Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan to North Africa's Algeria and Lebanon in the Levant - thousands of worshippers poured into the streets after midday prayers to voice their anger. Some protesters burned U.S. and Israeli flags or stomped Trump posters that showed the president alongside a Nazi swastika. In Jordan's capital of Amman, thousands marched through the center of town, chanting \"America is the head of the snake.\" Pro-Western Jordan is a crucial U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic extremists, but King Abdullah II cannot afford to be seen as soft on Jerusalem. His Hashemite dynasty derives its legitimacy from its role as guardian of the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, Islam's third-holiest site. Trump's decision has also strained U.S. foreign relations. U.N. Mideast envoy Nickolay Mladenov told an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council on Friday that Trump's announcement created a \"serious risk\" of a chain of unilateral actions that would push the goal of peace further away. Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour warned of the danger of \"a never-ending religious war that will only be exploited by extremists, fueling more radicalism, violence and strife in the region and elsewhere.\" Even traditional U.S. allies sharply criticized Trump's decision. Sweden's U.N. Ambassador Olof Skoog said the U.S. action \"contradicts international law and Security Council resolutions.\" Britain's Ambassador Matthew Rycroft called the U.S. decision \"unhelpful to peace,\" the French envoy expressed regret and Italy's Sebastiano Cardi warned of \"the risk of unrest and tensions in the region.\" The U.S. ambassador, Nikki Haley, told the council that the Trump administration is more committed to peace \"than we've ever been before - and we believe we might be closer to that goal than ever before.\" Haley did not explain. In Europe, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday played down the impact of Trump's policy shift, which also included a pledge to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Tillerson said it will likely take years for the U.S. to open an embassy in Jerusalem. In a news conference with the French foreign minister, Tillerson said Trump's recognition of the city as Israel's capital \"did not indicate any final status for Jerusalem.\" The United States is making clear that Jerusalem's borders will be left to Israelis and Palestinians to \"negotiate and decide,\" he said. Most countries around the world have not recognized Israel's 1967 annexation of east Jerusalem and maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. Under a longstanding international consensus, the fate of the city is to be determined in negotiations. Trump's announcement delivered a blow to Abbas, a supporter of the idea of reaching Palestinian statehood through U.S.-led negotiations with Israel. In siding with Israel on Jerusalem, he has said, the Trump administration effectively disqualified itself as a mediator. However, Abbas has not decided how to move forward, including whether he will rule out future U.S.-brokered negotiations. Trump has said he still intends to propose a Mideast peace deal. More than two decades of intermittent Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have failed to bring the Palestinians closer to statehood. Some in Abbas' inner circle say the old paradigm, with the U.S. serving as mediator, is no longer relevant. On Thursday, a senior Fatah official said the Palestinians would not receive Vice President Mike Pence when he visits the West Bank later this month, but it was not immediately clear if the official spoke for Abbas. The Arab League, an umbrella group of close to two dozen states, is to meet Saturday to try to forge a joint position, followed next week by a gathering in Turkey of the 57-state Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Turkish officials said Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to Turkey next week for talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Jerusalem's status and other issues. --- Laub reported from Jericho, West Bank.

At the most extreme end, we\u2019ve seen from recent atrocities in Manchester and London that innocent people have unwittingly been the target of trolls who use social media to prey on victims, subjecting them to vile and upsetting abuse. \n\u201cThese are individuals who are often in a deep state of shock.\u201d \nAfter the Manchester Arena bombing on 22 March, which killed 23 people and injured 250 others, four doctors working with casualties reported at debriefs that victims they had treated or their relatives had been trolled. \nSocial media can play a positive and negative role in the aftermath of a terrorist incident \nNHS England has not released details of the abuse but it is understood that some trolls accused victims of \u201ctrying to cash in\u201d on what had happened by talking to the media about their experience. \nThe perpetrators, who used Twitter, targeted people who had spoken out about the nail bomb attack by Salman Abedi at the Ariana Grande concert and directed messages at victims once their identities were known, NHS sources said. \nThe experiences in Manchester in particular have prompted NHS chiefs to warn victims of terror attacks, especially young people, to be careful what they say on social media after such an incident in case they unwittingly incite trolling. \nVictims should also limit their use of social media and the information they share there in case it brings back painful memories, the NHS says. \nThe section of the guidance which advises young victims of a terror attack about social media states: \u201cYou can also attract trolls: people who draw the most negative conclusions they can, or question your motives that don\u2019t exist or just be plainly unpleasant and abusive, often anonymously too; they can say things like \u2018you\u2019re only doing something for money\u2019, or to abuse the system and so on.\u201d \nIt adds: \u201cThis is incredibly hurtful \u2013 which is what the sender intends \u2013 and it will upset you, or make you angry, and that\u2019s never the best time to think about what you tell [people publicly about their experience or views on something].\u201d \nPosting information about a terrorist attack on social media can also worsen the trauma of victims, according to the guidance, which also advises patients and NHS staff on how to deal with journalists after major incidents. \nIt says: \u201cAfter an unsettling event try to stay off social media in case you say more than you intend because of what you experienced; messaging your story can keep you in the trauma; retelling your story can also bring back bad memories and can even relive the trauma.\u201d \nThose receiving abusive messages should not respond or reply but delete them and block the sender. \u201cConsider reporting hateful and abusive messages to the police and service providers,\u201d it says. \nMoran will use a speech at the NHS Expo conference in Manchester next week to set out how social media platforms and conventional publishers can play a beneficial role after a major incident, as well as highlighting the potential downsides, such as trolling. \nProf Neil Greenberg, a spokesman for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said online abuse could be very damaging to people who were struggling after being caught up in a terrorist attack. \n\u201cIf someone is still suffering with, for example, PTSD after experiencing a traumatic event, and are trying to get on with their daily lives, then being trolled could lead to their condition deteriorating and them having a setback. \n\u201cThat could increase their avoidance of social media and reminders of the traumatic event, or make them hyper-vigilant, worsen their concentration and bring up traumatic events in their minds. \n\u201cThese trolling comments, which are intended to hurt, could stop people moving on from very traumatic events,\u201d said Greenberg, an expert in psychological trauma at King\u2019s College London. \nThe NHS\u2019s initiative comes as Theresa May has stressed her support for a crackdown on internet bullying and harassment, which has been implicated in a number of cases in which young people have killed themselves. \n\u201cIf it\u2019s a crime offline, it\u2019s a crime online. I think sometimes people think that online is a different sort of world and it doesn\u2019t matter and you can do what you like. Actually, no, you can\u2019t. You should behave online as you would offline,\u201d the prime minister told the BBC. \nSocial media users should be educated to understand that their actions online can have consequences in the real world, especially for young people, May said.

For Trump, the proclamation was an important way to make good on a pledge to his political base, which includes evangelical Christians and pro-Israel Republicans eager for such a move. \"While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,\" the president declared Wednesday in announcing his decision. \"Today, I am delivering.\" Those were words to savor for a president who's been frustrated to see a number of key campaign pledges stalled or slowed - sometimes by a bitterly divided Congress, some by larger national or international concerns. Repealing the Obama era health care law is a promise unfulfilled, much to Trump's frustration. Withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement remains in his TBD column. And Congress has yet to approve money Trump has requested for his promised border wall. The president counts the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key victory. And he has acted on certain other campaign pledges with some caveats: He refused to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, but left the matter of new sanctions to Congress. He pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement but left open the possibility of rejoining it later. And he ordered an end to a program protecting young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as kids, but gave Congress six months to find a way to protect them from deportation. On Jerusalem, Trump had pledged during the 2016 campaign to recognize Israel's claim to the city and to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. He's now checked that box - although he offered no timeline for the embassy relocation and signed a waiver officially delaying any move for six months. Steve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, repeatedly counseled the president to take the step as a means of holding to his campaign promise and energizing evangelical voters. Observers were divided on how to score the president's action. \"If I were keeping score, I would rate this as fulfilling a campaign promise,\" said Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration official now at the Brookings Institution. \"Any move is significant and the world is right to regard it as a serious step.\" But Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, saw Trump's words about the embassy as \"just a grandiose statement on Jerusalem without a line in the sand.\" A host of world leaders had urged Trump in advance to reconsider his decision, warning that the action could have serious and immediate consequences in the tinder box of the Middle East. But after Trump announced his plans from a White House room laden with Christmas decorations, his backers gleefully heralded the move. An email from Trump's campaign operation trumpeted: \"Jerusalem: Another Promise Made and Promise Kept.\" And conservative faith leader Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a statement that Trump \"continues to deliver on his promise to the American people to strengthen the solidarity between the United States and the people of Israel.\" Critics warned the consequences could be dire, arguing that the move could inflame tensions in the volatile region and complicate Mideast peace efforts. \"My hope is it doesn't change much, and we have a couple days of protest,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. Aaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Wilson Center who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents, called the announcement a \"triumph of domestic politics and personal ego\" over \"sound foreign policy.\" Trump insisted he was not trying to derail a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. He repeated the U.S. position that Jerusalem's borders must still be worked out through negotiation, saying he wants \"an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\" The president hasn't hesitated to assess his first year in office as a banner success, pointing to promises kept, such as the installation of Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. During a recent speech in Missouri, Trump said: \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocios way. There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\" Trump's critics see bold words, but said he often delivers half-measures or rhetoric. \"What he does is he wants to give the perception of campaign promises filled,\" said Brinkley. \"It's making people feel there's activity and boldness going on. But what it is is rhetorical boldness.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "catherine lucey associated", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron david miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilan goldenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neil gorsuch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas brinkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill galston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for a new american security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east security program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rice university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith and freedom coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mideast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:27.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb0bc3c0d5c457f0aabe636830cd1b2dc062add7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9D9nsds3WY99zK509ZTSA89NgcgrHMLQpZy5G8XWOuolk9yZhfJ8gkn.bCaQZ_kbZs5zIXjw.LSWvgg3JbGboQD8VxhK14oAvfI6eFCz3MNzWe4k19nIaa3oWi9YsASI2cnwtDh5hSQ--", "site_full": "www.fxstreet.com", "site": "fxstreet.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Year-end balance sheet constraints keep weighing on EUR \u2013 Danske Bank", "title_full": "Year-end balance sheet constraints keep weighing on EUR \u2013 Danske Bank", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.238, "main_image": "https://editorial.azureedge.net/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/EURUSD/piggy-bank-with-falling-coins-gm505796756-79269379_Large.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 9758, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb0bc3c0d5c457f0aabe636830cd1b2dc062add7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9D9nsds3WY99zK509ZTSA89NgcgrHMLQpZy5G8XWOuolk9yZhfJ8gkn.bCaQZ_kbZs5zIXjw.LSWvgg3JbGboQD8VxhK14oAvfI6eFCz3MNzWe4k19nIaa3oWi9YsASI2cnwtDh5hSQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "Year-end balance sheet constraints keep weighing on EUR \u2013 Danske Bank", "text": "\nIn opinion of Aila Mihr, Analyst at Danske Bank, the pair is expected to remain under pressure in the next weeks. \nKey Quotes \n\u201cEUR/USD CCS widened significantly yesterday as the cost of hedging USD over the turn of the year spiked.

Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley announced this week the state would continue its challenge to the California law that requires out-of-state egg producers to comply with California\u2019s farming regulations in order to sell eggs in California. \nThe suit claims that California\u2019s regulations violate both a federal law and the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which gives Congress exclusive authority to regulate commerce among and between states. A federal appeals court panel rejected similar claims last year in a separate case, ruling that the opposition failed to show California\u2019s law would affect more than just individual farmers. Hawley, who is leading the charge as Missouri\u2019s Attorney General and will also run for a U.S. Senate seat next year, says the California law is \u201ca clear attempt by big-government proponents to impose job-killing regulations.\u201d \nMissouri is joined by Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin in the Supreme Court filing. \u00a9 2017 Nebraska Rural Radio Association.

This follows a decision by a Court of Appeal three-man panel today, comprising Ahmadi Asnawi, Kamardin Hashim and Abdul Karim Abdul Jalil, to reduce her jail sentence from five years to three years after allowing her appeal on the sentence. Kamardin, who delivered the court\u2019s judgement, set aside the five years\u2019 jail sentence and substituted it with a three-year jail term, to run from the date of her arrest on March 23, last year. He said the five years\u2019 jail term imposed by the High Court was manifestly excessive. The court, however, dismissed Siti Noor Aishah\u2019s appeal on her conviction, on the grounds that her appeal did not have merits. Kamardin said the court agreed with the High Court\u2019s findings that Siti Noor Aishah\u2019s defence did not raise a reasonable doubt against the prosecution\u2019s case. \n\nHe said the court also found that the High Court judicial commissioner did not make any error in his findings, and in his decision to convict Siti Noor Aishah on the charge which warranted the appellate court\u2019s intervention. The 30-year-old Siti Noor Aishah was found guilty by the High Court in Kuala Lumpur in April this year for the possession of 12 books on Jemaah Islamiyah, Islamic State, and Al Qaeda in Dungun, Terengganu on March 22, last year. She was initially acquitted and discharged by the High Court without entering her defence on Sept 29, 2016, but on appeal by the prosecution, the appellate court ordered her to enter her defence last March, and remitted the matter back to the High Court for her to do so. After the verdict, counsel Mohd Kamaruzaman A Wahab said he would seek his client's instruction on whether to bring the matter up to the Federal Court. He said since her jail term had been reduced to three years, Siti Noor Aishah is expected to be released by early next year as she had already served a year's jail and taking into account the one-third remission on her jail sentence. - Bernama ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "siti noor aishah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siti noor aishah atam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kamardin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmadi asnawi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kamardin hashim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "- bernama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohd kamaruzaman a wahab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdul karim abdul jalil", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al qaeda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "court of appeal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "terengganu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dungun", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:27.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c6d7f66eea9ea38caef976c3df8e402ffbd21f55", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOibZnlQb_tMCymyVUFx2nWgoBmsSbdmF1eDmLpoo6Tnh91Yf4A52BojJzPnU89Eo3RhoSPvRbCQCF1NGqaLX7jreVezXs3d6fFqx_QIU0IJlgV7Z0.hn4UwMsPo6B2RBlUbIu5K8TKtHyHkU0VWzdvV0-", "site_full": "www.freeads.co.uk", "site": "freeads.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.freeads.co.uk/uk/recent/rss", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Recent Free Ads in the UK", "title": "BMW 3 SERIES, 2005 (G2), Manual Diesel, 175,000 miles", "title_full": "BMW 3 SERIES, 2005 (G2), Manual Diesel, 175,000 miles", "published": "2017-12-07T09:49:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static1.freeads.co.uk/img/280x211/c7f7ca34d8606795870bad2d531dd49db16f0c08.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 22529, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c6d7f66eea9ea38caef976c3df8e402ffbd21f55", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOibZnlQb_tMCymyVUFx2nWgoBmsSbdmF1eDmLpoo6Tnh91Yf4A52BojJzPnU89Eo3RhoSPvRbCQCF1NGqaLX7jreVezXs3d6fFqx_QIU0IJlgV7Z0.hn4UwMsPo6B2RBlUbIu5K8TKtHyHkU0VWzdvV0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T09:49:00.000+02:00", "title": "BMW 3 SERIES, 2005 (G2), Manual Diesel, 175,000 miles", "text": "1 hour ago Description: FSHGraphite Grey with Suede Sports Seats, Full Service History(x10 stamps, 8 BMW),Full MOT, 18\" Alloys, Digital Climate Control, Rear Parking Sensors, Parrot Bluetooth, USB Port, Cruise Control, CD Multichanger, Trip Computer, Remote Central Locking, Electric Mirrors, HPi Clear, Excellent Condition and Driver(does not resemble mileage),Regisration number included..

(Photo courtesy of WNCC) Vinnie Shahid and Trent Harris combined for 46 points and the Cougars connected on 15 3-pointers in racing to a 102-70 win over Casper College Tuesday evening at Cougar Palace. Shahid led all scorers with 26 points while burying 10 of 11 free throws. Harris finished the night with 20 points and five 3-pointers. The win moves the Cougars, who received votes in the first NJCAA poll that was released earlier Tuesday , to 9-2 on the season. Harris said the team played well, especially in the first half where the Cougars offense and defense was stellar. The Cougars held a 40-19 halftime lead. \u201cWe practice so much defense and offense and we work harder on that than most of the teams in the country,\u201d the Scottsbluff graduate said. \u201cWe just transfer it to the games and it works out for us. We just defend as much as possible. We pick up full court and do anything possible to stop the ball.\u201d The Cougars definitely did that in the first half. WNCC trailed early 9-6 but went on an 18-0 run behind two Harris 3-pointers for a 24-9 lead. The Cougars closed out the half on a 9-0 run for the 40-19 halftime lead. WNCC never let up in the second half either and the game was never in doubt. WNCC went on a 11-0 run in the first five minutes that saw Harris collect another trey and Marlon Sierra slam home the ball for a 561-32 lead. WNCC pushed the lead to 40 points, 93-53 and hit the century mark for the fifth straight game on a Austin Hoffman 3-pointer. The Cougars are one of the top 10 highest scoring teams in the nation. WNCC put four players in double digits. After Shahid and Harris, Djodje Dimitrijevic had 17 points and three treys, while Sierra had 14 points. Harris said this team has so many offensive weapons. \u201cEverybody on the team can score,\u201d he said. \u201cPractices are so competitive. Whoever is open, we want them to shoot it because we trust anybody with the ball.\u201d WNCC will finish the first semester home slate with a Region IX South sub-region game with Eastern Wyoming College on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. The Cougars will then wrap up the first semester the next weekend with road trips to Western Wyoming and Central Wyoming.

Sign up By Denise See , Christian Post Contributor | Dec 6, 2017 11:43 PM Facebook/TheBigBangTheory Promotional image for \"The Big Bang Theory\" \nThe upcoming episode of \"The Big Bang Theory\" season 11 will see Sheldon (Jim Parsons) and Amy (Mayim Bialik) utilizing a subject they know very well to make wedding planning easier. \nThe synopsis of the next episode, titled \"The Confidence Erosion,\" states that Sheldon and Amy will be under a lot of stress due to their wedding planning. In order to help alleviate some of the pressure, they will decide to apply math to the activity. \nElsewhere, Raj (Kunal Nayyar) and Howard (Simon Helberg) will hit a rough patch. Deciding that Howard is actually doing more damage to his confidence, Raj will end his relationship with his best friend. \nA teaser trailer for the new episode has also been released. It shows Sheldon and Amy arguing over wedding details at their apartment. Amy wants butterflies to be released instead of confetti, but Sheldon thinks they just \"airborne worms.\" They disagree on almost everything, including what language to use for their wedding toasts and vows. Amy suggests that they choose a day and get it over with, so Sheldon hints at an elopement by offering to get married the next day. \nThree sneak peek videos also offer a glimpse at what is to come. The first clip shows Amy and Penny (Kaley Cuoco) drinking wine for girls' night. They are joined by Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) via video call, though she does not seem to be very happy about spending another night at home. Just then, Raj knocks on the door to ask for advice on an interview outfit. Amy is elated at first that he would go to her, but he clarifies that he is there for Penny. \nThe second and third clips are shorter. Sheldon and Amy are planning their wedding at their apartment. Amy believes that the task is easy but, as the synopsis reveals, that is all about to change. \nFinally, Penny is in the living room as Leonard (Johnny Galecki) walks in.

Some critics have begun questioning how much the Obama administration contributed to the problem with its 2011 intervention in Libya. Obama has acknowledged the issue before, calling it the \"worst mistake\" of his presidency. But as videos showing humans being sold into slavery shocks people around the world, the scrutiny has been renewed. \"The responsibility is on Barack Obama's administration,\" University of Texas professor, Alan J. Kuperman, said in an interview with Newsweek. The United States launched an operation in Libya with NATO in 2011 in an attempt to save civilians who were targeted to be massacred by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Kuperman claims overthrowing Gadhafi led to many of the failed nation's issues, including the slave trade. An investigation from CNN showed migrants being sold for as little as $400 at auction. Thousands of immigrants have fled Libya for Europe in an attempt to escape violence and instability. Since 2014, 22,500 migrants have died or disappeared according to the International Organization for Migration. President Trump has been accused of waffling on his position on the U.S. intervention in Libya, but he did share one prophetic thought on the matter in a tweet in 2011. \"As bad as Qaddafi was---what comes next in Libya will be worse---just watch,\" he said at the time. at  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moammar gadhafi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuperman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gadhafi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qaddafi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan j. kuperman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international organization for migration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newsweek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nato", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libya", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:27.063+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b1106a07306c230a84adc953fa1508c9f89ed5bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAps4LLDZNNZNoFB0N8XpvYAgxq6rc6tsdW7sLbCQs5L3HYB8oTnbcMvd4PzrROpAqww-", "site_full": "memory-alpha.wikia.com", "site": "wikia.com", "site_section": "http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?feed=atom", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Memory Alpha  - Recent changes [en]", "title": "Annette Helde", "title_full": "Annette Helde", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/memoryalpha/images/f/f9/Karina.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20060311081835&amp;path-prefix=en", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 114, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b1106a07306c230a84adc953fa1508c9f89ed5bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxAps4LLDZNNZNoFB0N8XpvYAgxq6rc6tsdW7sLbCQs5L3HYB8oTnbcMvd4PzrROpAqww-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Archer4real", "published": "2017-12-07T11:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "Annette Helde", "text": "For the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' [[VOY Season 4|fourth season]] episode {{e|Scientific Method}}, Helde filmed her scene on Thursday {{d|31|July|1997}} on [[Paramount Stage 8]].

The roars of passion, the cries of misery and the quiet solitude in acceptance of defeat served to produce an intense melting pot of emotions as contestants moved in and out of qualification places like a yoyo, continuing to build upon the drama that was all too overwhelming for some in a truly remarkable night to be remembered in the PLP history books.\n \nRoach, needing nothing other than a victory against Marsden, seemed to be heading towards the last 16 after a single Feyenoord equalizer promised a potential point in a game both men had predicted wins for Napoli. A consolation goal in an otherwise unrewarding match for both parties has so frequently been the deciding factor amongst many of our historic PLP matchups, and this started to look very likely to happen once more as the clock ticked into stoppage time.\n \nBut few would have expected what was coming next. The Dutch side were already eliminated, they had nothing to play for, but as Roach will come to discover, these sorts of meaningless and insignificant ingredients so often produce the perfect recipe for a cookbook PLP drama. In the 91 st minute, Jeremiah St. Juste was the man sent by God to deliver the decisive verdict, off the substitute bench just 15 minutes earlier to head one last attack into the Italians\u2019 net. For Jeremiah, just a goal to add to a tally. For Craig, utter, inconsolable heartbreak. But for Marsden, a mixture of relief and euphoria as the wheel of fortune, yet again, spins in his favour. After coming so close to European glory, I don\u2019t know how my old school friend will find the motivation to drag himself to Barnsley this weekend.\n \nAnd Craig wasn\u2019t the only one to experience a rollercoaster of emotions yesterday evening. In Group G, Greenhill C just needed to get the job done in Portugal and hope Croft failed to overcome leader Friston. It wasn\u2019t looking so promising for Chris in the 65 th minute. Porto went 4-1 up to ruin his chance of a perfect prediction, and Besiktas\u2019 early lead in Germany continued to hold for Croft. However, Falcao\u2019s goal for Monaco in the 78th gave Chris hope for a consolation point, and his pleas of desperation across Europe were finally answered when talisman Naby Keita equalized for Leipzig to cancel out Croft\u2019s advantage. Screams of joy and elation not heard since Iceland\u2019s EURO 2016 goal against France echoed from the Greenhill household. That was it, it was done, and Chris had paved his way to the last 16. But had he? One last-minute corner. A loose ball. A fatigued weaker foot swung in the general direction of the goal. Besiktas midfielder Anderson Talisca smashed the ball high into the net just seconds before the end, sending travelling fans, and Croft, absolutely wild.\n \nElsewhere, Blogg managed to keep Hutchinson at bay to secure a Worst Qualifier Playoff place. Both men had predicted victories for Manchester United against CSKA Moscow by similar margins, and so a perfect prediction was likely to be required by our 2015/16 PLP Champion to stand a realistic chance of progressing. Unfortunately, it was not to be this time around, and it\u2019s back to the relegation battle this weekend after a disappointing European campaign from one of the tournament favourites. In Group C, Smith gave Boutle a scare by successfully predicting a goalless score from Qarabag, but it was not to be for our Derbyshire lad who needed to win more convincingly to secure safe passage. Bearne, meanwhile, will be frustrated at an opportunity missed, as Chelsea came to within an inch of a victory which would have otherwise seen him leapfrog both his squabbling rivals in the most unlikely of Group Stage comebacks.\n \nPerhaps the most surprising result was Miller\u2019s failure to reach the last 16. PLP\u2019s revered king looked odds on to progress after fighting back to 2 nd place on Match Day 5, but his brave prediction of a draw for Dortmund in Madrid failed to pay off, and Evans\u2019 perfect result for Spurs at Wembley was enough to leave Sam by the wayside. Miller joins a list of esteemed company following his Champions League exit, with 5 of the original 9 Pot 1 contestants now out. The elimination of so many reputable Predictors at this stage has opened up the chance for new competitors to find success in later rounds, and surely now makes the likes of Marsden, Morton, Willcocks and Greenhill A favourites for the trophy.\n \nI\u2019ll back later on today with the Worst Qualifier Playoffs, which are as follows:\n \nBoutle vs Blogg \u2013 Vardar vs Rosenborg \nHead vs Marsden \u2013 Red Star Belgrade vs FC Koln ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anderson talisca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremiah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "friston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenhill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "croft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hutchinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremiah st. juste", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boutle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bearne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naby keita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marsden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "falcao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "willcocks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vardar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "porto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monaco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cska moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dortmund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red star belgrade", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosenborg  head", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "besiktas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "feyenoord", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "derbyshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leipzig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wembley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "napoli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qarabag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portugal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barnsley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iceland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:37:28.009+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15118523, "moreResultsAvailable": 15118423, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512639448009&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 590}
