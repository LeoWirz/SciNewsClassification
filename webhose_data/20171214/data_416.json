The Queen walks with the ship's commanding officer as she arrives at the ceremony. Credit: PA \nThe reason why the Queen is here is to formally commission into the Royal Navy the ship which bears her name. The Queen speaks during the commissioning ceremony for the warship Credit: PA \nThe aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, isn\u2019t any old ship. \nAt 65,000 tonnes, it\u2019s the biggest warship ever built for the British Navy. \nYou\u2019ll find an ample 4 acres of space on the flight deck capable of supporting 48 fighter jets and helicopters. \nAlthough, you won\u2019t find any of the jets on board today. Royal Navy ratings practice in the hanger of HMS Queen Elizabeth ahead of her commissioning ceremony. Credit: PA \nThe UK government has only ordered around a dozen so far \u2013 and it\u2019s understood the original plan to buy 135 of the new generation F-35 jets is being scaled back because of a lack of available funds in the Ministry of Defence. \nThe Queen has stepped on board this huge vessel once before. \nIt was in 2014 in Rosyth in Scotland where the aircraft carrier was assembled. \nThen, the Queen officially named the ship (after herself). Workers carry a sign for HMS Queen Elizabeth. Credit: PA \nToday\u2019s service marks the moment that HMS Queen Elizabeth completes her sea trials and is ready to be commissioned into the fleet. \nThe White Ensign was raised on the upper deck before the Queen made a speech to the Ship\u2019s Company (700 are required to operate the ship but she can carry 1,600 personnel when a full air group is assembled). \nThe Queen was joined by her daughter, Princess Anne, who is Commodore-in-Chief of the Portsmouth naval base where this aircraft carrier will be based. The Princess Royal was also present at the ceremony Credit: PA \nHowever, the ship is still some way off being ready for active service. She must first carry out more trials of the F-35 fighter jets - when they finally come off the production line in the USA (final number to be determined) Crew members onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth during a previous sea trial. Credit: PA \nAnd Queen Elizabeth won\u2019t be ready to join the Carrier Strike Group until 202 1- more than a decade after the Navy\u2019s previous aircraft carriers were scrapped by the coalition government to save money. \nThe second aircraft carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, is still under construction in Rosyth and she was named earlier this year by the Prince of Wales himself.

One could be seen wiping away a tear. \nWhat a day for love, for equality, for respect. Australia has done it, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said. \nThis is Australia, fair and diverse, loving and filled with respect. \nLove has won and it\u2019s time to pop the bubbly, Greens MP and same-sex marriage supporter Adam Bandt said. \nIt\u2019s an historic day for Australia today and I think the celebrations around the country when we finally \u2026 achieve marriage equality are going to be immense, Janet Rice said before the vote. \nThe Greens party senator was only able to remain married to her transgender wife of 31 years, Penny Whetton, because Penny remained listed as male on her birth certificate. \nPenny Wong, a Labour party senator who has two children with her lesbian partner, said: I am feeling happy. \nCampaigners gathered outside the building rejoiced at the news. \nThe law is expected to be ratified within days, making Australia the 26th nation to legalise same-sex marriage, after some of its states ruled homosexual acts to be illegal until just 20 years ago. \nThe first legal same-sex unions will be allowed from January. \nThe existing bill allowed churches and religious organisations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws. \nAs the new bill was introduced and debated on Monday, gay MP Tim Wilson, from the ruling Conservative party, fought back tears as he proposed to his partner \u2013 Ryan Bolger in the country\u2019s House of Representatives. \nOn Tuesday, Austria\u2019s supreme court ruled to legalise same-sex marriage in the country from 1 January 2019.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "penny whetton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penny wong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet rice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam bandt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan bolger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "conservative party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greens", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:42.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f1e7a68288d73acee26ad8b23527e33eff50af5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7Cj6wSDhfq6kypB6MNGa8rPeRGngbAKa_z00YBmrYDOgh9q_UW3Cn1mmgR.K2LWIfBbb7EWfsJIsZSfS9NqIaRw-", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ios?sort=newest&pagesize=15&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'ios' Questions - Stack Overflow", "title": "How to get the range of string for attributed string?", "title_full": "ios - How to get the range of string for attributed string? - Stack Overflow", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.182, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f1e7a68288d73acee26ad8b23527e33eff50af5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7Cj6wSDhfq6kypB6MNGa8rPeRGngbAKa_z00YBmrYDOgh9q_UW3Cn1mmgR.K2LWIfBbb7EWfsJIsZSfS9NqIaRw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Krunal", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "How to get the range of string for attributed string?", "text": "I have string as 2/42 .

He gives us something we haven\u2019t got it from the No.10, he can play there and get past the main striker. He and Camp are scheduled to play for the u23s next week, Camp and Healey, Kadeem I\u2019m not sure might be the week after. \nI\u2019m not thinking of loaning Rhys out. What\u2019s happened with injuries i\u2019m loathe to loan anybody out. Rhys Healey wearing a bright green top in Cardiff City training 11:34 On playing last this weekend \nDoesn\u2019t matter. It won\u2019t be six point gap because Bristol play Sheffield. We have to hang in there. We want to make sure we\u2019re in the play-offs. \n43 points - normally I\u2019d say we\u2019re seven points from safety. I\u2019m not trying to play it down, I\u2019ve been around longer than you guys so I know how things change it. The lads are grounded, but we should take our hat off to the players and we\u2019ll try and stay there as long as we can. \nI don\u2019t see pressure where I am now, like last year and year below, there\u2019s far more pressure trying to save a club from relegation. It\u2019s a great place to be at the moment. There\u2019s too many downs in life, why the hell worry about it, let\u2019s enjoy the next few months. 11:32 On Tomlin's eye-catching performance against Norwich \nThat\u2019s what he can do but he still has to work on other aspects on his game. He has to work hard on his fitness which he doesn\u2019t find easily. Hopefully he can eventually start a game. We have to get him on the top of his game. Not just him, to improve, we need some luck with others. We\u2019ve lost four of our best players. I sometimes forget who we\u2019ve lost because they\u2019re not there but it is frustrating because I know how good we could be with those lads. 11:30 KEY EVENT Warnock rubbishes speculation over Tomlin's wages \nLee Tomlin was the subject of comments from Peterborough United chairman Darragh MacAnthony this week, with suggestions that the playmaker was earning \u00a328k a week. \nHere\u2019s Warnock\u2019s response: \nHe\u2019s trying to get out of a hole with his own fans. At least get the facts. I bet Tomlin wishes he was on that money. He\u2019s nowhere near that, miles away. I like Darragh but sometimes because of who he is he says what he likes and to hell with the consequences. I think he was trying to get out of a hole with his own fans. They wouldn\u2019t have had a cat in hell\u2019s chance of signing him. Lee Tomlin of Cardiff City is brought down by Norwich City goalkeeper Angus Gunn 11:25 KEY EVENT Kadeem Harris edging closer to full fitness \nI\u2019d know in the next two or three weeks about Kadeem - he\u2019ll have a proper game next week - it will be a like a new player. We\u2019ve lost a few important cogs and yet we\u2019ve carried on with the results. \nIt doesn\u2019t necessarily have a bearing. Kadeem Harris of Cardiff City is consoled as he leaves the field with an injury 11:24 KEY EVENT Warnock looking to keep Feeney \nFeeney\u2019s done really well it\u2019s just unfortunate for him, I\u2019ve put different people in that position. He\u2019s warmed up a couple of times and I\u2019ve had to change my mind because of things happening in the game. I do like him, I\u2019d like him to stay, but not had discussion. \nI know what Liam can do, but is there anyone better available? I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re looking at all positions, it\u2019s just he\u2019s vulnerable more because he\u2019s only here till January. Cardiff City's Liam Feeney against Preston (Image: PA) 11:21 Warnock relishing Reading test \nI thought they should have gone up. They\u2019ll probably kick themselves for not beating Huddersfield. To see them going up was a big blow for them, I\u2019ve been in that situation. They signed some good players like Barrow, Aluko, so they\u2019ve got some really good players, it\u2019s a great challenge for us. Nobody really expects us to beat these teams. We got to have a plan, Reading pass every team off the park, so we can\u2019t go out willy-nilly. We have to know what\u2019s coming and put together a game plan to get the right results. 11:20 Any January arrivals? \nIf we could strengthen we would, if there was one player I think could strengthen us and become available, we would. I\u2019ve spoken to Ken [Choo] because what happens if players have set backs with injuries? We have to be looking ahead. We have targets in most departments. We can cover more or less at the back, it\u2019s more midfield, wide and up front to see if we can bring in anyone better than we have. I think Wolves will spend more than us. 11:19 Hunting Wolves \nWe still look at catching Wolves. They\u2019ve had some good runs, but if Birmingham played like they did against us they might have got a result. They\u2019ve got more money than anybody, but you have to invest it wisely. They\u2019ve done that and they\u2019re the team to finish above to win promotion. We haven\u2019t got an inferiority complex. I just wish there were a few more teams like us who beat them. \nIt\u2019s usually people with chips on their shoulder or who haven\u2019t managed that say stuff about us. Sometimes they trip over themselves in what they say. \nEvery criticism comes when we beat a side, they didn\u2019t say anything at Birmingham and Preston. What they should say how can Cardiff be where they are on their wage bill compared to how much that team spent and that team spent. 11:17 Do Wolves deserve all the plaudits? \nIt\u2019s bound to be about teams like Wolves, Villa, Derby, Boro, they\u2019re the really big hitters, so people talk about them because more newspapers sell in those areas. We\u2019re just happy going along as we are, treat it like a bonus and enjoy it, and with a little bit of luck with injuries, we can improve with a lot more to come from two or three. Zohore hasn\u2019t got going but he looks bright again because we know we\u2019ve got to the bottom of his problem. Kadeem trained - touch wood - for the first time and came through a training game and looked sharp. We\u2019ve coped with injuries, like with Jazz, we have to hang in there. I can\u2019t fault the lads, we\u2019ve done well, the results have been what we\u2019ve deserved. Wolves' boss Nuno Espirito Santo shakes the hand of Jordan Graham (Image: PA/Nick Potts) 11:10 KEY EVENT Zohore out until the New Year \nHe was in so much pain and we talked about going through the pain and running it off. He was adamant and we might have doubted, but when the surgeon went in it was one of the worst he\u2019d ever seen so the pain was legitimate. You can see the relief on his face because he knows he just has to get himself fit. He\u2019s building up but I won\u2019t rush him. We\u2019re going to have him for 2018 and he will be important. I won\u2019t look at him over Christmas, possibly the Fulham Preston games, but I doubt it, I wouldn\u2019t want to rush it. Like Mendez could have played against Forest but we felt it might be too soon, didn\u2019t want to miss for another six weeks. \nMendez got better against Norwich, and that run in second half proved to himself he was okay, he needed that. We were really pleased he came through it. 11:09 Warnock on building momentum \nIt\u2019s an open league, anyone can go three or four games without winning. It doesn\u2019t worry us, you don\u2019t want it, but you have to keep working hard, You can\u2019t get too up and down when it happens, everyone loses points. It can be luck of draw when you play teams - like when we went to brim under a new manager. Every game is winnable and every game you can lose, that\u2019s the beauty of the Championship. Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock (Image: PA) 11:07 Zohore still sidelined \nWe\u2019ve got quite a lot of problems on the injury side and ten days extra supposedly helps, whether it does or not I\u2019ll wait and see. \nWe have to keep going with whoever\u2019s available and another tough game coming up. \nThere are the usual injury worries, Gunnar, Zohore, Mendez played 60mins which is a good thing. \nWe\u2019re having a game this morning between ourselves to give guys like Halford, Pilks, Connolly, some game time rather than training. \nIt\u2019s a matter of getting to January to see where we need to bring another one in to help us. \nIf we get everybody back fit we might not need anybody, but we might not, it\u2019s a concern at the moment. Not Zohore for Monday, Gunnars might have a chance but we haven\u2019t written him off. He had an injection. It\u2019s not his original injury, it\u2019s a piece of floating bone that\u2019s been there a while but hopefully an injection can calm it all down. 11:03 \nThat\u2019s it from Bogle. Stick around for some words from Warnock 11:03 What happened after red card? \nHe\u2019s a black and white man, he won\u2019t shirk anything. After a game like that he would have been angry, with me in particular. He\u2019s honest. We sat down and had a chat about it and when the dust settled we spoke and he said don\u2019t worry about it, be ready. \nHe and Kev and Jeppo, during the time I\u2019ve been here, even when not playing at the start, the work they put into me as a player in training I felt I was improving. 11:02 What's it like working under Warnock? \nIt\u2019s experience. When you want to speak to people, when speak to fans the first thing you say is about his man managing, his experience of dealing with so many players over the year helps us. The way he gets his messages across and his temperament is great. Everyone loves him, no-one has a bad word to say about him. 11:01 Are you thinking about promotion? \nIt\u2019s at the back of your mind, the majority of teams would have had the aim at the start, but we\u2019ve still got 26 games to go. We just concentrate on getting the next three points. It\u2019s a big dream, I had promotion from non-league with Grimsby, that feeling was nothing like i\u2019ve had in football and to have it again getting to the premier league would be even better. 11:01 How good would it be to win five on the trot? \nIt\u2019s great to be in winning form, it builds morale, the camp is happy, it\u2019s a long season, we have to take every game when it comes. We have to repeat what we did at the start of the season, we can go on long runs, in a season you will win and lose but our mentality is to go and win every game. 11:00 Bogle relishing competition \nThe results before us, we\u2019ll have an eye on them, it\u2019s about us and all we have to do is keep winning games. \nCompetition drives everyone on, Ken to come back, Wardy scored a great goal, everyone has to work hard and be determined to stay in the team. Every game we go into we know the quality we\u2019ve got and we focus on ourselves. \nWhen we\u2019re at our best not many teams can match us. 10:56 Something to prove? \nI told the gaffer and the boys I would make it up to them. I believed I could do it and knew I could. Norwich was a good start to rectify that. \nWe just focus on the next game, we not getting ahead of ourselves, the team spirit is really high with good players, we going into every game knowing we want to win. 10:54 THAT red card \nIt was frustrating. I was playing well as well, it was a rush of blood to be honest. I\u2019ve had a loose touch and I wanted to rectify the situation. It was a striker\u2019s challenge. I can\u2019t tackle. I look at it I cost the team the game, go down to ten away from home was always going to be hard, It was about bouncing back. Omar Bogle's red card dominated the headlines after Cardiff City's defeat to Bristol City 10:51 Bogle on how his move to Cardiff came about \nA new manager came in at Wigan and I wasn\u2019t for him. Football\u2019s based on opinions and the gaffer there wanted to go a certain way and I didn\u2019t get into his plans. When it became known I was available, there were a few clubs in for me and Cardiff were one of them. \nWarnock was the biggest thing when it came down to a decision between a few Championship clubs, his history of developing players and success. Nathaniel Mendez Laing is one of my close friends and I spoke to him and everyone\u2019s seen what he has done since he worked under the gaffer. \nI had to bide my time. Three or four games in I came in with the team already flying. It was about being patient. The gaffer couldn\u2019t really change the team, everyone who was playing would be expected to play because they were doing so well, but it\u2019s a long season and I knew a chance would come and I had to be ready. 10:49 \nHere we go then. \nStriker Omar Bogle gets us underway. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been good for me since I\u2019ve come into the side. It was unfortunate what happened at Bristol which meant I was out for a few games but it\u2019s gone well. Omar Bogle of Cardiff City wheels away to celebrate after he scores City's third goal against Norwich 10:39 The man Cardiff have to watch \nYann Kermorgant has been involved in four goals in his last five league matches against Cardiff (three goals, one assist), scoring in both matches against them last season. Here\u2019s hoping he has a quiet one on Monday. Yann Kermorgant of Reading celebrates after scoring a late goal 10:18 10:01 Big day for Cardiff \nThe progress of Cardiff City is noth the only concern for football fans in the Welsh capital right now. \nToday will see UEFA reveal whether Cardiff will host any matches at the upcoming Euro 2020 tournament. \nOur man Ian Mitchelmore has live updates right here A general view of the Principality Stadium 09:50 \nNot long until we get going this morning. \nIn the mean time, why not take in the latest installment of Blakey\u2019s Bootroom? \nThis week, the lads ask why Wolves are getting all the plaudits ahead of City, and what role can Omar Bogle play in the forthcoming promotion push after his heroics against Norwich. 09:41 Bogle to face the media \nOmar Bogle will be kicking us off this morning. \nThe striker went a long way to making up for his red card at Bristol City by sweeping home a fine goal in the win over Norwich City. Omar Bogle is keen for further progress under Neil Warnock (Image: Huw Evans Picture Agency) \nStick around!

warns 7th December 2017 \nThe House of Lords has said that a no-deal Brexit would \"deeply damage\" the UK, impacting not only the economy, but also aviation, counter terrorism and nuclear safety. \nThe damning report said it is difficult, if not impossible, to envisage a worse outcome for the UK than a no-deal scenario. \nThe EU Committee went on to warn that there would be a grave impact on trade in goods, UK ports would find themselves overwhelmed and Irish land borders would be introduced. \nPeers also called the March 2019 departure date impossible, and said enshrining it into domestic law would not be in the national interest. \nDespite such reports, Theresa May has insisted that Brexit negotiations are on course and that good progress has been made. \nAfter days of confusion and deadlock over the Northern Ireland border, the issue is now looking likely to drag on into next year. \nThe PM spoke with Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster ahead of Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. \n:: Clock is ticking for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plans \nMrs May also spoke to Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar, who warned her that there is no guarantee that Northern Ireland negotiations will be wrapped up before the New Year. \nAfter the DUP refused to sign a divorce deal on Monday, Mrs May had been hoping to make a new offer to satisfy both Ireland and the DUP by the end of this week. \nRounding on Mrs May during PMQs, opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the Government of presiding over a shambles in Brexit negotiations. \nAnd after a difficult few days, Mrs May has found herself facing yet more problems. \nBrexit Secretary David Davies admitted that despite previous assurances, the Government has not carried out any impact assessments on how the EU pull-out would affect the UK economy. \nChancellor Philip Hammond also came under fire, after revealing that the Cabinet had not yet discussed details of the UK\u2019s preferred long-term relationship with the EU. \nMrs May will be hoping to be able to show there has been sufficient progress in the Brexit negotiations ahead of next week\u2019s EU summit so talks can move on to a trade deal with the remaining 27 EU member states.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leo

It started with me waking up after nine hours of sleep! I struggle with sleep deprivation so nine hours were both shocking and heavenly! I felt rested and optimistic. I was prepared for a good day even though I was going to the hospital to get a new insuline pump and being taught how to use it. \nI ate breakfast, did a hundred sidekicks and jumped in the shower. The taxi that was going to bring me to the hospital was on time and it was a nice driver. I arrived at the hospital thinking it would be boring to be there for four hours, but I\u2019d try to make the best of it. The woman who was teaching me was really nice and had a good sense of humour. She had never tried teaching it to someone who could not see the screen, but she did an amazing job! We were finished already after 1 hour and 45 minutes! I was really happy it was over that quick! I wanted to get home! The ride home was easy and I was happy when I got back home! \nThe first thing I did when I got home was eating some food and then I managed a load of laundry. After I had hung the clothes on the drying rack I thought I would walk a bit. A bit turned into a bigger bit and when I got back home I had walked for 6km. I was surpriced because it was further than expected. It was difficult to walk. The snow makes the sounds softer which makes it difficult to use my echo locating. In large portions of the streets there were no snow. Die to many cars having spiked tires this made all the sounds way louder! This again made it sifficult to use the echos. \n\nWhen I was home I took another shower, ate and smiled. This was a good day and I will try to repeat the feeling often!

We had 530 attendances here in Newham on Monday, our normal rate is about 430, so you can see that the numbers are going up. \nBut we saw 97% of people within four hours yesterday which is a terrific performance by this hospital, so we are coping. \n:: NHS in \u2018toughest ever financial situation\u2019, says outgoing trust boss \nWe\u2019ve now got a system wide plan which involves not just the hospitals in the area but also social services, community services, metal health and primary care. So we\u2019ve got one big system working together for patients. \nThe chief executive of NHS Providers, Chris Hopson, said: Our report highlights the range of measures trusts have put in place to improve resilience and provide safe, timely care for patients. \nBut we have to recognise we are not where we would want to be as we head into winter. \nThe NHS is already under severe pressure, and while the additional funding in the recent Budget is welcome, it has come very late to be used to maximum effect. \nThe warning comes as NHS England publishes its first winter pressure situation reports, figures that will reveal the volume of patients attending A&E departments across the country in the first few days of December. \nIn previous years they have also included the number of A&E departments under pressure, defined as those that have activated the two highest level of escalation plans. \nThe NHS uses four Operational Pressure Escalation Levels, known as OPEL 1-4, in response to extreme stress. \nOPEL 3 is declared when major pressure compromises patient flow, and OPEL 4 when pressure means hospitals cannot deliver comprehensive care, and there is the potential for patient care and safety to be compromised. \nSources have suggested those figures will be withheld this winter, but NHS England said it was unable to clarify what statistics will be included ahead of publication.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "patien", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alistair chesser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris hopson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nhs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "a&e", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newham university hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "budget", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sky news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "opel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhs providers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhs england", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "newham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:44.027+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "043351843fabe8a9f3bc92fdfedba19bf1bd03b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMri0ZjF2OuNUYO1CgcZwFrsyHC4ZIiJ3gEKAOOhEa7nRL0BIHKxe3g7XEJVp40HuOey8RM4ervU2ikbGiZVCxN_reXg7Cnsl2I-", "site_full": "tapesboobs.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://tapesboobs.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "tapes and boobs", "title": "Sapphic fun of fucking with slutty roommates", "title_full": "Sapphic fun of fucking with slutty roommates", "published": "2017-12-07T11:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "043351843fabe8a9f3bc92fdfedba19bf1bd03b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMri0ZjF2OuNUYO1CgcZwFrsyHC4ZIiJ3gEKAOOhEa7nRL0BIHKxe3g7XEJVp40HuOey8RM4ervU2ikbGiZVCxN_reXg7Cnsl2I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "lek embot (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sapphic fun of fucking with slutty roommates", "text": "\n\nKeywords: ass-fuck, ass-fucking, booty, butt\ndirect download HERE ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:44.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2fecbb8e7cfc262913259b7dcfcf823dfdebe220", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9WHuikno3C7RR61CbzJYFCHlcU_bgogEJpTqnM0rgpiP_hSKU5nSpl6L5GZLE0oztNYx4HU9J28E8r1M8eBAgT8lckNwIeTiisZxLyZnnWqfcETpkBrjUN0JjedfGtNgVE6MWfnjHO3MptN8u4.TWZ", "site_full": "www.khodedbaze.com.ng", "site": "khodedbaze.com.ng", "site_section": "http://www.khodedbaze.com.ng/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Khodedbaze Blog -

Facebook user, Israel Joe who shared the story and photo revealed that the suspect has been arrested. Read below\u2026 \u201cYesterday 4th December, I was called to a situation that made me wept right here in the city of Warri, Nigeria. Chiamaka have been severally harassed and raped by her uncle. Last week, this little girl declined and was brutally tortured to almost stupor by this callous uncle. After much beaten, she succumb and was again raped with blood gushing out of her body. She could hardly go to school with her tattered uniform and excruciating pains from both the rape and torture she got from this animal called uncle. When she opened her body yesterday, with marks of wire all over her back, chest and stomach, and narrated her ordeal to her teacher, the school immediately called the police. The uncle was apprehended and his wife who is an elder sister to Chiamaka\u2019s mother surprisingly was ignorant of this wickedness perpetuated by her husband. I guess you can\u2019t look at her private part without a lion heart\u2026 You can\u2019t but cry. Thanks to the Nigerian police (QRS) as their investigations keeps on inspiring us and we shall pursue this case to a reasonable conclusion to ensure justice is done. We had to admit this young girl who could barely walk at the hospital yesterday. Why this rapes and sexual harassment against the girl child? Why this gender violence against this child.

The emergence of the seventh emanation in Ha-Malkut and the political unrest in Hestra during their own change in rulership were only samples of the political unease that would come and go in waves during this time. Elves having barely recovered from natural disaster, nomads with little taste for war, and lizardfolk content to take their share of the goods passing through their mountains would have to find in themselves the strength to defend what land they could call their own. And a blood-drunk nation in the north, just turning from its latest kill to survey the world at large, would do little to stabilize the region.\n-An excerpt from Urist the Survivor\u0092s Histories\nPlease don\u0092t read spoilers that are for other kingdoms if you\u0092re playing. If you aren\u0092t, read on.\nSpoiler: What is this? (click to show/hide) This is the IC thread for Markov\u0092s Kingdoms. Much more detail is contained in the OOC thread .\nSpoiler: Queen Hadreena of Hestra (Shadowclaw) (click to show/hide) The reports just finished piling on Queen Hadreena\u0092s desk as the winter thaws began up in the mountains, raising the level of the Hestran river. They detailed the locations, timings, and suspects, if there were any at all, in the deaths of four of her siblings, leaving only one behind, three uncles, eight cousins, and a particularly tragic incident involving an entire family, burnt inside their own building, bringing the body count to twenty. Beside this stack was a list of letters. Condolences from supposed allies, notifications that one of her more powerful aunts regretted that she could no longer support her rule, as she had to flee for her own safety, and two death threats. Those likely weren\u0092t credible, at this moment at least. It would be incredibly impolitic to kill her immediately after her coronation, and she had the support of the clergy; those responsible would pay, if the attacked her. But it was clear that the consequences for attacking her family were somewhat more nebulous. If she didn\u0092t instill some sort of order, she could very easily hemorrhage support as those who would otherwise stand by her realized the danger of doing so. An isolated queen would not likely be a long-lived one in Hestra.\n There were also worrying reports that this year, more than just meltwaters might make their way down the mountains. The Viri S\u00e1nguinum Imperii a literally blood-thirsty and militant people, were rumored to have finished licking the wounds that were left from their recent conquest of the dwarves that used to populate those mountains. The death of the dwarven kingdom had been manageable for Hestra; it meant a lighter flow of goods to the mountains at the time, but in the long-run it had only brought dwarven refugees, who turned out to be excellent craftsmen, into the city. But the prospect of being turned into thralls for those that lived in the mountains was a sobering one.\nKingdom Status\nEconomy : Healthy (4d6)\nMilitary : Ready (3d6)(Holding)\nCulture : Content (2d6)\nSpoiler: Imic Greymane of Eldrathion (Imic) (click to show/hide) Three reports sat on Imic\u0092s desk, The Sanguine Threat , A New Master in the South , and Less Peninsula Every Year . Compiled by groups of advisors, they laid out what challenges this spring most likely held. In the mountains to the northwest, the Telrac had finished feasting on dwarves, and potentially looked for new victims. They were a fearsome race, though they had not come down from the mountains in a long time. To the south, along the coast, the Deep Ones were said to be following a new Eldritch master, although the report was mum about the nature of this new thing. As far as they could tell, it was a kind of viceroy for a larger entity. That entity had, in the past, seen fit to keep Ha-Malkut as a trading nation. If that continued to be the case, it would seem no threat at all. But a new master might see a change to all of that. The final report detailed how some of the western coast of the peninsula seemed to slip into the sea every year, leaving fishermen to watch as the surf creeps towards their home. The report wasn\u0092t clear on the timescale of the erosion, or therefor how imminent the threat was.\nKingdom Status\nEconomy : Healthy (4d6)\nMilitary : Ready (3d6)(Holding)\nCulture : Content (2d6)\nSpoiler: Chief Cielo Racion of Cantiera (Hibou) (click to show/hide) Looking out over Cantiera from a tall spire, Chief Racion saw prosperity, but also external threats to that prosperity. To the east lay the sea, and the ports of Ha-Malkut. They had ever been a key destination for the goods passing through Cantiera, but as important as they were, they had also never been understood. Who or what the Deep One\u0092s served, was something of a challenging question to get answers to, and a number of Cantieran scholars had literally lost their minds trying to answer the question. But what was agreed was that recently the power structure had changed. Change could be profited from, if leveraged properly; but losing access to the sea would be another issue entirely.\n To the north was competition, of a sort. There were essentially two ways through the mountains that covered this coast: the pass through Cantiera, or the one through Hestra. Rumor had it a large part of the new ruler\u0092s family had been killed off rather suddenly by rebellious nobles. That kind of destabilization might actually be beneficial, if leveraged properly.\n To the west, the displaced elves from the Forest that Was were finally making headway on establishing a kingdom. That could hopefully be a trade opportunity, for those willing to pass underneath the volcano\u0092s shadow and breathe her dust, but so far communication had not been established, and their stance towards trade was unkown.\nKingdom Status\nEconomy : Healthy (3d6)\nMilitary : Unprepared (2d6)(Holding)\nCulture : United (4d6)\nSpoiler: Adelina the Eternal Empress of Viri S\u00e1nguinum Imperii (piratejoe) (click to show/hide) Adelina saw that her people were still pleased with their conquest of the dwarves. A long-lived race, they naturally were also long-minded, and reveled in victories and felt the shame of their defeats over much longer time periods than the short-lived races did. But that victorious glow was beginning to turn into a hedonistic frenzy, directionless and chaotic. That chaos could damage the order she had built, and it was clear the Imperii would need something to unite over. Some productive task would have to be found. A priest had been attacked the other day, before the attacker was pulled off and summarily executed. A bad omen for the direction that idle hands would turn soon.\n And to make matters worse, idle was exactly what most of the hands in her empire were. Not only did the nation as a whole not have a direction, many individuals were having increasingly hard times bringing money into their homes. Economic thinking might not be something that came readily to her, but it might be necessary to take up that cause to repair years of neglect.\nKingdom Status\nEconomy : Stagnant (2d6)\nMilitary : Ready (4d6)(Holding)\nCulture : Content (3d6)\nSpoiler: Gamchicoth of (is?) Ha-Malkut (Maximum Spin) (click to show/hide) Gamchicoth felt throughout the part of himself that was Ha-Malkut that there was unrest, rising from the depths. A calm surface, to be sure, but he could feel it. Anxiety, distress, uncertainty. The parts of the world that were not also him were changing, and the Deep Ones that lived in Ha-Malkut were upset by this change. They kept this emotion deep in themselves, because tied to it was often a thought. The thought that Dagon might have been wrong in remaking Ha-Malkut, in destroying his predecessor and install Gamchicoth. Maybe there was too much unrest in the outside world for this to have been the moment. They covered this thought with others, like the thought that, to be sure, Gamchicoth is far superior to Iaugraandi. And that they could imagine no better being to rule than Gamchicoth, not that they could imagine him. But underneath all of that was the suspicion that this was poor timing. Gamchicoth would have to help them keep this suspicion deep, or expel it entirely. It would not do for it to bubble up to the surface, where Lord Dagon might feel it.\nKingdom Status\nEconomy : Healthy (4d6)\nMilitary : Ready (3d6)(Holding)\nCulture : Upset (2d6)\nSpoiler: Han\u0092Qerr of House Miero, ruler of High Vallus (Blood_Librarian) (click to show/hide) Han\u0092Qerr felt a wind blow down from the north, and on that wind were fragment of the Forest that Was, the old Tree Grove. It was a painful reminder that once, their air had been clean. The pain came not only from the memories, but from the ash kicked into the air by those winds. That ash had been the biggest threat since they left the forest, but it had also come from their greatest provider. The volcano gave them obsidian from which they could fashion powerful magical tools and some of the most precise blades on earth. Its foothills were also home to the metals which the elves needed so badly, in order to get the food they required. But, despite this tenuous hold on life, the elves of High Vallus finally had enough stability, and something that might even be approaching material prosperity, that they could start looking to the future, and building the kind of land that they wanted to live in. This time, though, they would need to be ready to defend it.\nKingdom Status\nEconomy : Healthy (4d6)\nMilitary : Unprepared (2d6)(Holding)\nCulture : Content (3d6)\nSpoiler: Map (click to show/hide)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://i.imgur.com/RlakV7b.png"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:43:45.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1129232f5fe9e7be16024a109fc0c1a4100e43ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b2mgF8c2D1y0CaUh2LifJlQ2K1ax8QE4E3hw82kpZEIQjo34WBKuiXZZcVXn1p9M-", "site_full": "www.bay12forums.com", "site": "bay12forums.com", "site_section": "http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?board=15.0", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "Forum Games and Roleplaying", "title": "Markov's Kingdoms [IC] - Turn 0", "title_full": "Markov's Kingdoms [IC] - Turn 0", "published": "2017-12-07T12:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 76718, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5db1dc679843f096edbf16d8461e60c6d6dd587b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_b2mgF8c2D1y0CaUh2LifJlQ2K1ax8QE4E3hw82kpZEIQjo34WBKuiJz1zXMgMZIK6QYaFj3jW8HbdlQYzMypt", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "bloop_bleep", "published": "2017-12-07T15:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Spoiler: Queen Hadreena of Hestra (click to show/hide) Hadreena had spent much time in her own chambers conciliating on what to do next, there was two major conflicts that had to dealt with which were the Vampiric folk in the north that had to be sedated and making sure the local nobles are well-happy so that they don't try to instigate a civil.

This would mean that the military structure would have to change from holding to recruiting, and this new-found professional army will be used as a tool for Hestra to make sure the nobles back off their claims from the throne, and essentially scare them away from there gaming tactics.

She knew as well as the next Telrac that if she remained content and stayed in her own little chunk of land, the people would start turning towards each other rather then look outward for opportunities. Naturally, she would need to do a few things to make sure that the people kept busy and didn't lose sight of the greater picture at hand. She also would need to fix the economy and make sure that riches flow through the nation. She considered a few possibilities, such as raiding Hestra and their caravans, however she thought that before starting another conflict that would take time and money, it might be better to expand her lands by simply getting people to colonize the untamed and clearly rightfully Viri S\u00e1nguinum lands to the west. Of course, that would also take time and money but, as far as she was concerned, the lands there would possibly have riches and be a wise investment. Of course, before starting up on such a course however, she would have to make sure to send a few explorers out to see if they couldn't find anything of importance or note in the forest that was, after all, if it was full of treasures not within the mountains, she would happily send people to take it.

Unlike other tournaments, it is not for world champion status or huge cash rewards: it is for regional pride and glory.\nFans have voted for their favourite players from the top eight regions of the world -Europe, Turkey, North America, Brazil, China, Korea, South-East Asia and Taiwan- to represent them in five-person teams. Typically many of these players play against each other on opposing teams, as in club football or rugby, but here they are brought together to claim global supremacy. Imagine the England football team being chosen by a public vote, instead of Gareth Southgate.\nFor European fans, that means players from the European League Championship Series are coming from three teams to work together. Players all use pseudonyms rather than real names, and so Paul \u2018sOAZ\u2019 Boyer, Marcin \u2018Jankos\u2019 Jankowski, Tristan \u2018PowerOfEvil\u2019 Schrage, Martin \u2018Rekkles\u2019 Larsson, and Lee \u2018IgNar\u2019 Dong-geun will represent Europe.\nThe tournament will begin with a round-robin group stage. Split into two groups of four, each team will play each other once, with the top two performing teams from each group moving on to the semi-finals.\nT he semi finals will be a best-of-three series, with the winners moving on to a best-of-five final to be crowned the All-Stars 2017 champion.\nThere is also a smaller one-on-one tournament taking place for individual players. Typically, League of Legends has teams of five, but 1v1 tournaments put players against each other in a test of their own skill and knowledge. Two players from each region are competing in this tournament (with Europe represented by Tristan \u2018PowerOfEvil\u2019 Schrage and Martin \u2018Rekkles\u2019 Larsson), and the first person to be defeated in each game is knocked out through the first elimination stages.\nSamsung Galaxy were crowned League of Legends World Champions earlier this year, raising the cup for the second time. M ost people are expecting the Korea to come out on top with good reason. At the League of Legends World Championships, Korean teams dominated the rest of the world, resulting in an all-Korean final, and this All-Stars 2017 is made up of players from reigning world champions Samsung Galaxy and last year\u2019s world champions SK Telecom T1.\n06 Dec 2017 , 4:59pm Pok\u00e9mon Go Generation 3 | Hoenn starter Pok\u00e9mon available later this week B ut the format of unfamiliar players from different teams working together means it could be anybody\u2019s tournament. Brazil, while typically underdogs, excel in absurd situations, so are likely to come out with at least one win in the group stages due to the unorthodox nature of the teams.\nE urope, meanwhile, have a relatively safe group. While they\u2019re up against Korea in their first game of the group stages, their other opponents Turkey and Taiwan, aren\u2019t expected to perform as well. Coming first would be the European dream, but with Korea in the group second is perhaps a more realistic target. Needless to say, the match between Europe and Korea will almost certainly be one of the more fascinating tussles.\nIf Europe do get through, there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll be able to play against North America. Between those two regions lies the greatest rivalry - ever since League of Legends has had professional play, Europe and North America have been butting heads, and in a tournament for glory, that\u2019s only going to be more intense.\nThe Chinese team are likely to be coming along with flair, and you can never tell what the Brazilian team will be cooking up: there\u2019s no 4-4-2 \u2018safe\u2019 strategy in League of Legends, and this is the perfect tournament for teams to do something truly wild.\nIn the one-on-one tournament, many people will be looking to Korean superstar Lee \u2018Faker\u2019 Sang-hyeok as the favourite. His biggest competition is Jian \u2018Uzi\u2019 Zi-Hao from China. The two are in separate groups, meaning that the only way they can face off would be if they both go all the way, making for an explosive finale.\nY ou can watch the event on the official site,
