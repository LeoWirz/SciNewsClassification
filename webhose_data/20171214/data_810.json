FILE - In this Wednesday, Sept. 21, 2016 file photo Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, and Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras joke before a bilateral meeting during the United Nations General Assembly...   \nBy ELENA BECATOROSAssociated Press \nATHENS, Greece (AP) - Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Athens Thursday for the first official visit to Greece by a Turkish president in decades, with Greece hoping the trip will help improve often frosty ties with its neighbor and NATO ally. \nErdogan was greeted by an honor guard at the airport and headed to central Athens, laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier before talks with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and other officials. On Friday, he travels to northeastern Greece to meet with members of the country's Muslim minority. \nSecurity was tight in the Greek capital, with roads shut down and demonstrations banned in the center of Athens. \nOn the eve of his arrival, Erdogan alarmed Greek officials by saying in an interview with Greece's Skai television that the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which determined current Greek-Turkish borders among other issues, should be \"updated.\" \n\"In fact, all agreements (pacts) in the world should be updated with the passage of time,\" Erdogan said in the interview. \"Lausanne too, in the face of all these developments, is in need of an update. This update would be beneficial not only for Turkey but also for Greece.\" \nErdogan has made similar comments in the past about the peace treaty, which set the borders of modern Turkey, but his repetition on the day before his arrival in Athens came as an unwelcome surprise to his hosts. \nHis comments \"raises serious concerns and questions,\" Greek government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said in a statement. \n\"The Greek government and the prime minister want his visit to be a reason to build bridges, not to raise walls.\" \nTzanakopoulos said respecting the treaty is \"the exclusive and non-negotiable foundation on which the honest cooperation of the two countries can be built.\" \n\"Comments regarding its revision do not contribute to the climate we are trying to build in our relations and in the region,\" he said. \nThe refugee crisis will be high on the agenda of talks with Erdogan, as Greek islands have been the gateway into Europe for migrants crossing from the Turkish coast. Regional relations, energy and business ties, Turkey's stalled bid to join the European Union and longstanding disputes such as Turkey's territorial claims in the Greek Aegean will also be discussed. \nOne of the current thorny issues to be raised will be the case of eight Turkish servicemen who have requested asylum in Greece following last year's failed coup in Turkey. Ankara has demanded their extradition, a request rejected by Greek courts on the grounds they could not be guaranteed a fair trial in Turkey. \nThe move infuriated Erdogan, who said in his Wednesday interview that his country's judicial system is \"the best in Europe.\" He said Tsipras had promised to return the servicemen in \"15 to 20 days\" after they flew to Greece in a military helicopter. \n\"That is what he said. But unfortunately right now they are still in Greece,\" Erdogan said, adding that the servicemen should have been handed over before Greek courts became involved. \n\"If you leave it up to the judiciary there will be no result,\" he said. \"In order to facilitate the work of the judiciary you must first, as the government, take the necessary measures before you assign it to the judiciary.\" \nErdogan's visit comes as his country finds itself increasingly isolated on the international stage, and his comments will be closely watched for signs he might try to improve some of Turkey's international relations, particularly with the EU. \nTurkey's ties with the EU, and with several European countries, deteriorated significantly following Erdogan's post-coup crackdown. Tens of thousands of Turks have been fired from their jobs, and tens of thousands more have been imprisoned on accusations of being linked, however tenuously, with Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Islamic cleric that Erdogan blames for masterminding the coup. \nOther than Greece, Poland is the only other EU country to have invited Erdogan to visit since mid-2016. \nHistorical tensions between Greece and Turkey, which have brought the two countries to the brink of war on three occasions since the 1970s, remain. Decades-old thorny issues include territorial disputes in the Aegean, the Muslim minority in northeastern Greece and the continued occupation by Turkish troops of northern Cyprus. \nTension between Ankara and Washington has also increased recently, particularly over the New York trial of a Turkish banker over alleged transactions with Iran.

Col. Deo Akiiki, deputy spokesman for the Ugandan military. \nUganda was the first country to deploy troops to Somalia in 2007 to back a weak federal government in Mogadishu against an insurgency by the extremist group al-Shabab, which is responsible for many deadly attacks in Somalia and elsewhere in the region. \nUnder an agreement between the African Union and the U.N. Security Council the number of all African peacekeepers in Somalia will be reduced by 1,000 before the end of 2017, Akiiki said. The African Union plans to withdraw all its 22,000 forces from Somalia by the end of 2020, prompting questions about the ability of Somalia's army to fight al-Shabab on its own. \nUganda has more than 6,000 troops in Somalia as part of the multi-national African Union force. Other African countries such as Burundi and Kenya also contribute to the regional force. \nThe Western-backed deployments have helped to push Islamic extremists out of Mogadishu and other areas, even though the rebels still make frequent bombing attacks targeting public places. The armed group is now mostly active in the southern rural areas of Somalia. \nAl-Shabab, which is allied to al-Qaida, opposes the presence of foreign troops in Somalia. The group has mounted deadly attacks in Kenya and Uganda, saying the killings were in retaliation over those countries' military involvement in Somalia.

(PGCIL) \nPower Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID) was incorporated on October 23, 1989 under the Companies Act, 1956 with an authorized share capital of Rs. 5,000 Crore (subsequently enhanced to Rs. 10,000 Crore in Financial Year (FY) 2007-08) as a public limited company, wholly owned by the Government of India. \nIts original name was the \u2018National Power Transmission Corporation Limited\u2019, and it was charged with planning, executing, owning, operating and maintaining high-voltage transmission systems in the country. On 8 November 1990, the National Power Transmission Corporation received its Certificate for Commencement of Business. Their name was subsequently changed to Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, which took effect on October 23, 1992. \nPOWERGRID started functioning on management basis with effect from August, 1991 and subsequently it took over transmission assets from NTPC, NHPC, NEEPCO, NLC, NPC, THDC, SJVNL etc. in a phased manner and it commenced commercial operation in 1992-93. In addition to this, it also took over the operation of existing Regional Load Despatch Centers (RLDCs) from Central Electricity Authority (CEA), in a phased manner from 1994 to 1996, which have been upgraded and modernized with State of-the-art Unified Load Despatch and Communication (ULDC) schemes. Consequently, National Load Despatch Centre (NLDC) was established in 2009 for overall coordination at National level. \nAccording to its mandate, the Corporation, apart from providing transmission system for evacuation of central sector power, is also responsible for Establishment and Operation of Regional and National Power Grids to facilitate transfer of power within and across the Regions with Reliability, Security and Economy on sound commercial principles. Based on its performance POWERGRID was recognized as a Mini-ratna category-I Public Sector Undertaking in October 1998 and conferred the status of \u201cNavratna\u201d by the Government of India in May 2008.

| The Daily Home | annistonstar.com", "text": "Save SYLACAUGA \u2013 The City Council is opposing the proposed closure of the Childersburg Work Release Center. The council in a 5-0 vote Tuesday evening approved a resolution imploring Gov. Kay Ivey and the Alabama Legislature to continue operations at the center at its current location in Childersburg. Other government agencies have also approved resolutions seeking help from the governor on this issue. The Alabama Department of Corrections announced last month a three-pronged plan to improve staffing in state prisons. Part of the plan involved moving inmates out of the work release center and transferring the property to the Alabama Department of Pardons and Paroles. Operations at the center would be discontinued, and the facility would be repurposed for use as a Life Tech Transition Center. The transition center will provide vocational, education and life skills training to parolees who are preparing to transition back into society. According to a press release from the Department of Corrections, the staff currently assigned to work the release center will be offered positions at the St. Clair Correctional Facility in Springville and other facilities. The inmates would be moved to St. Clair and other minimum level facilities, including the Alexander City Work Release Center. Inmates could still be used by governmental agencies in surrounding communities. The agencies would pick the inmates up and bring them back to St. Clair or Alexander City. Those round trips would leave little time in the day for the inmates to work, officials have said. The resolution indicates a negative financial impact of more than $3 million would be realized by the communities affected by this proposal. The resolution also states economic conditions over the last 10 years have negatively impacted the financial resources of local governments. Sylacauga, along with its neighboring counties, cities, towns and colleges, has not fully rebounded from what the resolution said was the Great Recession of 2008. The work release center is centrally located in the Childersburg area and accessible to agencies in the region. The agencies want to meet with the governor on this issue as soon as possible. A letter was sent to the governor by the agencies following a meeting Monday morning at Oak Grove.

He is charged with leading a terror organization, engaging in terror propaganda and other crimes. \nThe trial is one of many against Demirtas, who is imprisoned in northwestern Turkey. He did not attend Thursday's trial. \nDemirtas was arrested last year when the government launched a crackdown following a failed coup attempt, which critics say has been expanded to target all government opponents and dissenting voices. \nThe government accuses the HDP, the nations' third-largest party in parliament, of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. The HDP denies the accusation. \nProsecutors accuse Demirtas of being a leader of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish rebels and hold him responsible for street violence that broke out in 2014 during protests against government policies on Syria. \nThe violence led to more than 30 deaths. \nThe New York-based advocacy group, Human Rights Watch, criticized the trial, calling it \"part of a wider pattern of repression against government critics.\" \n\"Holding the leader of a major opposition party in pre-trial detention for over a year on flimsy charges is another example of the political abuse of the criminal justice system we are repeatedly seeing in Turkey,\" said Hugh Williamson, Human Rights Watch's director for Europe and Central Asia. \nThe Turkish parliament stripped lawmakers of legal immunity last year, paving the way for the arrest of several HDP legislators - including Demirtas and former co-chairwoman Figen Yuksekdag - on terror-related charges. \nThe arrests follow the collapse of a fragile peace process between the state and the PKK in 2015. The group is considered a terror organization by Turkey and its Western allies. \nYuksekdag lost her seat in parliament earlier this year after an appeals court confirmed her 2013 conviction for engaging in terrorist propaganda, and later stepped down as the HDP's co-leader.

Global Proton Exchange Membrane Market is segmented, By Product Type, into Nafion PEM, Others. Proton exchange membranes have the ability to transport or exchange protons. These membranes are usually made from either inorganic or organic ionic polymers. Ionic polymers display both \u2013 non-directionalionic and directional covalent bonding in themolecular structure of the polymer chain or network. The covalent bond delivers structural faithfulness, whereas the ionic bond delivers structural functionality for frequent applications.\nA proton exchange membrane or polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) comes across as a semipermeable membrane devised fromionomers and designed for conducting protons while acting as an electronic insulator and reactant barrier, e.g. to hydrogen and oxygen gas. This is their mandatory function when joint into a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell or of a proton conversation membrane electrolyzer(wherein separation of reactants and transport of protons occurs) while blocking a direct electronic pathway through the membrane.\nFull Research Report On Global Proton Exchange Membrane Market Analysis available at: https://www.millioninsights.com/industry-reports/proton-exchange-membrane-market \nProton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells operate at comparatively low temperatures (<80\u00baC or <175\u00baF), offer quick start-up times, and necessitate only hydrogen and oxygen to operate. PEMs can be made from either pure polymer membranes or from compound membranes where the other materials are engrained in a polymer matrix. Recurrent use polyaromatic polymers while others use somewhat fluorinated polymers.\nContingenton their origin, these polymers are also natural ionic polymers or synthetic ionic polymers (such as polyacrylic acid). In terms of their functionality, they may be cationic or anionic. They are also classified as weak and/or robustcationic and/or anionic, contingent on the extent of the dissociation of ionic functionality. Proton exchange membranes have also been used as moisture, carbon monoxide, and drug sensors, as carriers for enzymes and functional materials, as solid polyelectrolytes and electromechanical actuators, and for creating photovoltage and photocurrent. These applications could lead to new uses of ion exchange membranes.\nProton exchange membranes are principallyconsidered by proton conductivity (\u03c3), thermal stability, and methanol permeability (P). PEM fuel cells use a solid polymer membrane (a thin plastic film) as the electrolyte. This polymer is permeable to protons when saturated with water, but it doesn\u2019t conduct electrons.

Sinclair said she started out in the accounting department. \u201cSandy Carden got me an application, and I filled it out and Zell Copeland hired me,\u201d she said. Sinclair stayed in the accounting department from 1984 to 2000, then moved into advertising. Marketing Director Pam Isbell said, \u201cNell was the glue that held everything together. Everything we do comes down to the ads going into the layout \u2026 The layout is one of the most important things the ad department does. \u201cShe was like my right hand. She handled multiple reports every month, and if there was an insert that wasn\u2019t right or a late ad, she would bring them to me to get them fixed.\u201d Isbell added, \u201cShe\u2019s also a kind, wonderful person, a calming person. To know her is to love her. She was also professional and always took pride in her work, and she\u2019s the most patient person in a stressful situation that I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d Publisher Robert Jackson called Sinclair \u201cthe point person in the ad department for layout and the conduit between advertising and the newsroom as well, which makes her role even more important. \u201cShe has done an exemplary job of juggling the demands of the ad side and the news side. We certainly wish her well in her retirement and the next phase of her life.
