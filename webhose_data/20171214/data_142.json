The $1 billion home of the J. Paul Getty Museum sits in the Santa Monica Mountains and has been closed to prevent harm to its works from smoke from several wildfires.\nIts collections range from pre-20th century European paintings to Roman and Greek antiquities, tapestries, photographs and manuscripts, all protected by extensive anti-fire systems outside and in.\nSmoke detection and sprinklers are ever-present at the center, along with pressurization systems to keep smoke out or reverse flow if it does get in.\nThe center has its own reservoir to supply suppression systems if necessary, and there is an on-site helipad to fill helicopters with water. Hydrants throughout the property are fed from a large-diameter loop.\nThe immediate zone around the building is kept green with fire-resistant plants, and the expansive area surrounding the campus is rigorously kept clear of grasses. Canopies of oak trees also serve to suppress the growth of vegetation that could feed a blaze.\nThe Getty Center is on the west side of Interstate 405, and the fire ignited on the east side. It quickly raced up steep slopes into the wealthy neighborhoods of the Bel-Air area, destroying some homes as firefighters and aircraft sought to beat it down.

Jay Pharoah plays Floyd Mooney, balancing the success he enjoys as a standup comedian among black audiences with trying to work as an actor and gain traction with white viewers.\nTom Kapinos, who had previously created Showtime\u2019s long-running dark comedy CALIFORNICATION , created WHITE FAMOUS with Buddy Lewis and Chris Spencer. He talks about the series\u2019 beginnings and how it all works.\nASSIGNMENT X: How did WHITE FAMOUS come together? Did Jamie Foxx come to you with it? \nTOM KAPINOS: No. Showtime came to me a couple of summers ago. I guess they had bought this from Jamie and a couple of his buddies who do standup and I guess they were never quite happy with how the script turned out, so they just asked me to take a crack at it. Then I met Jamie, and he was hilarious, and it just went from there.\nAX: Did anybody think it was rather strange that they asked a white writer to do this story that is largely about being black in Hollywood? \nKAPINOS: You know, that would be more a question for Showtime, because they just thought, I think, based on CALIFORNICATION , that I could bring my comedic voice to it. I mean, I certainly thought it was odd, but after I met Jamie, it was just such a fun meeting, and I was like, \u201cYeah, this seems like another opportunity to create an out-there comedy in the cable space.\u201d\nAX: Did you learn anything in the course of doing WHITE FAMOUS? \nKAPINOS: I wouldn\u2019t say I learned anything. I just approached it as trying to make a fun comedy with heart. I always approached it as, \u201cI\u2019m going to try and do something cool and outrageous and fun.\u201d\nAX: Are the things that happen in the show based on any specific experiences Jamie Foxx has had, or is it more just the tone of it? \nKAPINOS: The times I met with him, he always has a ton of stories. So I would take fragments of that and just kind of work it into what Lloyd was going through. So there\u2019s little beads and pieces, but it\u2019s not \u2013 there\u2019s no one thing that is based on his experience.\nAX: As your leading man Jay Pharoah actually has a background in standup, is any of his comedy incorporated into the scripts? \nKAPINOS: A little bit here and there. In the pilot, you see a little bit of it. But I definitely didn\u2019t want to do something that was just in and around comedy clubs. So it was more about him being kind of Alice in Wonderland and dumped into white Hollywood and what that felt like to him and just the crazy people you meet out here. So it\u2019s a little bit more Hollywood-focused than standup comedy-focused.\nAX: Stephen Tobolowsky\u2019s character from CALIFORNICATION, producer Stu Beggs, has carried over into WHITE FAMOUS. Are any other CALIFORNICATION characters going to show up? \nKAPINOS: There are a few minor characters that work their way into the show. It\u2019s fun. Because to me, it\u2019s the same Los Angeles as CALIFORNICATION , so you run into some of the same people. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever make our way up to Hank Moody [ CALIFORNICATION \u2019s protagonist, played by David Duchovny], but there will be a few.\nAX: Stephen Tobolowsky has said he came in to do the pilot script read for WHITE FAMOUS, thinking he was just doing the reading that one time, without knowing you intended him to be in it or that it would be the Stu Beggs character \u2026 \nKAPINOS: Yeah. When I wrote the pilot, the character was just kind of a crazy producer, and we had a difficult time casting the part. We got down to the wire, and we came up with the idea to have [Tobolowsky] come in and read it just as a favor. And it was just so fun, and there were so many laughs, I just decided with Showtime\u2019s blessing that we make it the same character.\nAX: And is executive producer/director Tim Story involved in the writing at all? \nKAPINOS: Tim came on after I had written the pilot script and Showtime decided they wanted to make it. He\u2019s the producing director. He\u2019s involved in the sense that he\u2019s free to come to me if he has a note on something. He directed Episodes Two and Three and he\u2019s going to direct our finale as well.\nAX: You\u2019re the show runner as well as the co-creator? \nKAPINOS: Yes.\nAX: Have you brought in any of your CALIFORNICATION writers? \nKAPINOS: There\u2019s one writer from CALIFORNICATION that carried over. The rest are new people I\u2019ve met along the way. Actually, one of my writers is an assistant from CALIFORNICATION days, but everyone else is a new friend.\nAX: Would you say that WHITE FAMOUS is a little more upbeat in tone than CALIFORNICATION? \nKAPINOS: Yeah. I think that\u2019s a good way to phrase it. I mean, it\u2019s crazy, but it\u2019s a lot lighter than CALIFORNICATION . I think that has something to do with the main character is at a different place in life. He\u2019s struggling to get somewhere. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s world-weary and been through a lot. So yeah.\nAX: Well, Floyd is not going through a suicidal personal crisis \u2026 \nKAPINOS: Exactly. Although there is a love story of being with a woman, and it didn\u2019t quite work out the way he wanted, so that\u2019s always there, that\u2019s a similarity, but it\u2019s much lighter in tone.\nAX: And what would you most like people to know about WHITE FAMOUS? \nKAPINOS: Just that it\u2019s a crazy, outrageous Hollywood satire with heart.\nThis interview was conducted during Showtime\u2019s portion of the Television Critics Association (TCA) press tour. \nRelated: Exclusive Interview: Actors Kendrick Sampson and Lyndon Smith on Season 1 of the new Showtime series WHITE FAMOUS \nFollow us on Twitter at ASSIGNMENT X\nLike us on Facebook at ASSIGNMENT X \nArticle Source: Assignment X\nArticle: Exclusive Interview: Co-Creator Tom Kapinos on Season 1 of WHITE FAMOUS  \nAssignment X - The Pop Culture Entertainment Magazine for Movies, TV, DVD, Blu-ray, Video Games, Books, Comics and Technology \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom kapinos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meagan g", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie foxx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom kapinos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen tobolowsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hank moody", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kendrick sampson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyndon smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay pharoah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kapinos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buddy lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "floyd mooney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris spencer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david duchovny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim story", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "floyd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stu beggs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lloyd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tobolowsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chen showtime", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "showtime", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "television critics association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.031+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df70c0165e762a91f872043795ff97c686228c65", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9.Xj8EhPdo8csZfABnNm77yVVQS.irOq59wj9ua1A8vilI9mQAvuMJw3ycsPPlLXGMvjOwmofm_7_EW84bN29gEvaSNgMHW7CZRjQ4w1yFGbAQ.Vp66Eso", "site_full": "www.ssuchronicle.com", "site": "ssuchronicle.com", "site_section": "http://www.ssuchronicle.com/feed", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "University Chronicle", "title": "Wilton Law & Mediation Celebrates Silver Anniversary", "title_full": "Wilton Law & Mediation Celebrates Silver Anniversary", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "df70c0165e762a91f872043795ff97c686228c65", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9.Xj8EhPdo8csZfABnNm77yVVQS.irOq59wj9ua1A8vilI9mQAvuMJw3ycsPPlLXGMvjOwmofm_7_EW84bN29gEvaSNgMHW7CZRjQ4w1yFGbAQ.Vp66Eso", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Benzinga Full Feed", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Wilton Law & Mediation Celebrates Silver Anniversary", "text": "  Wilton Law & Mediation Celebrates Silver Anniversary Wilton Law & Mediation Celebrates Silver Anniversary Posted on Leadership   \nWilton Law & Mediation marks twenty-five years serving clients throughout Southern California, including Los Angeles and Ventura Counties.

Following the introduction of trucks for long-haulage and construction, the focus is now on urban and additional low-carbon transport solutions.\n\"With today's release, Scania comprehensively sets the stage for the necessary shift towards sustainable transport, offering tailored low-carbon trucks for all transport applications,\" says Christian Levin , Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing.\nThe new fuel-efficient future-oriented trucks all feature the widely acclaimed styling and product characteristics of the new truck generation. Among these are enhanced driveability as well as improved visibility, increased safety, ergonomics and comfort. With the new generation trucks, Scania is taking major steps in providing customer-adapted trucks for even better total operating economy.\nScania extends its urban range \nWith the introduction of the lighter trucks powered by the new 7-litre engine, Scania offers urban transporters a new level of transport efficiency with fuel savings of up to 10 percent. With its more compact dimensions, the new P-series cab can feature a lower engine tunnel, which opens up a more spacious cab interior. Drivers will enjoy the best driving conditions in the industry in vehicles that excel in handling, steering and driveability \u2013 all of which are essential in challenging urban traffic.\nLow entry for higher efficiency \nThe L-series is Scania's newly developed cab series for urban transport, such as distribution, refuse collection and maintenance. Drivers will benefit from vastly improved direct vision of the surroundings. Drivers will also be at the same height as other road users, with the added advantage of improved working conditions when repeatedly entering and exiting the cab. The Scania L-series features a kneeling mode and lower boarding steps on both sides of the cab. Drivers can also take advantage of the space in front of the engine tunnel to exit on the passenger side, thereby avoiding oncoming traffic.\nKeeping an eye on safety \nIn addition to the better view over surrounding traffic, Scania introduces the City Safe Window. Drivers will thereby have better opportunities to detect nearby pedestrians and cyclists. The window on the passenger side door is available for all P- and L-series cabs, those most common in urban transport, as well as for the CrewCab.\nScania CrewCab \u2013 protecting those that protect \nSince Scania's new CrewCab will mainly be used by firefighters, it has been specifically tailored for emergency assignments, keeping both ergonomics and safety in mind. For extra safety, there is an option for up to four roll over side-curtain airbags. The CrewCab accommodates up to eight passengers with a high level of safety and comfort, which includes a separate climate system with its own heating for the crew area.\nBreakthrough for gas-fuelled long-haulage operations \nScania already offers the broadest range of trucks for renewable fuels, including ethanol, biodiesel, HVO as well as hybrid technology.\nWith Scania's introduction of a six-cylinder 13-litre gas engine specifically designed for regional and long-haulage operations, climate-conscious hauliers now have a strong alternative to conventional fossil fuels. For a 40-tonne truck-and-trailer combination with tanks for liquefied gas, the range has been extended to 1,100 kilometres. In parallel, Scania also releases a 9-litre gas engine for the new truck generation.\nIncreased uptime with flexible plans \nScania Maintenance with Flexible Plans is now also made available for the gas engine range.Significantly greater maintenance precision can be achieved on the basis of the vehicle's actual usage pattern as continuously monitored through connectivity. The solution ensures that every single truck gets exactly the right maintenance at exactly the right time, thereby reducing time in the workshop and increasing uptime.\n\"With the new generation trucks, Scania is taking major steps in improved safety, driver comfort and fuel economy. The released models have been universally praised and awarded for their innovative features and overall performance and we are certain that the new urban range will be equally successful,\" says Levin.\nMore information available on www.scania.com/group/en/section/pressroom/presskit/ .\nFor further information, please contact: \nHenrik Eng \nProduct Director, Urban, Scania Trucks\nPhone: + 46-70-658-98-29\nemail: henrik.eng@scania.com \n\u00d6rjan \u00c5slund\nHead of Product Affairs, Scania Trucks\nPhone: +46-70-289-83-78\nemail: orjan.aslund@scania.com \nThis information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.com \nhttp://news.cision.com/scania/r/scania-unveils-future-oriented-city-trucks,c2409320 \nThe following files are available for download:\nhttp://mb.cision.com/Main/209/2409320/763714.pdf \nN17028EN Scania unveils future-oriented city trucks \nhttp://news.cision.com/scania/i/17289-001,c2298329 \n17289-001 \n \nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/scania-unveils-future-oriented-city-trucks-300568294.html \nSOURCE Scania\nRelated Links \nhttp://www.scania.com/group/en/section/pressroom/presskit/.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christian levin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henrik eng  product director", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "levin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "scania", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hvo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "urban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scania maintenance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scania trucks phone", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:02.061+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a91534cc229ca3443f6518eda713354bda29ff6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyZWWt1fkZVQUAP_N99M4YC2onoao6TVvbsq.41t_DHyhIuliiLltUgITIxHLuXSrPC3LzKWGIQqTdCyxDimDjBDT51xUOrZCx2zrCd7m8tymFi33bxKnIXkzcBdwx9mUVRs5OzveOoPLYFyBYF7JaZPfjwRe.aj7GZEnB6G9Gr3Q--", "site_full": "prsync.com", "site": "prsync.com", "site_section": "http://prsync.com/rss/", "site_categories": ["marketing", "financial_news", "finance", "business"], "section_title": "PR sync", "title": "Global Mobile Backend as a Service (BaaS) Market New Study of Trend and Forecast Report 2017-2022", "title_full": "Global Mobile Backend as a Service (BaaS) Market New Study of Trend and Forecast Report 2017-2022", "published": "2017-12-07T05:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 17518, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a91534cc229ca3443f6518eda713354bda29ff6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyZWWt1fkZVQUAP_N99M4YC2onoao6TVvbsq.41t_DHyhIuliiLltUgITIxHLuXSrPC3LzKWGIQqTdCyxDimDjBDT51xUOrZCx2zrCd7m8tymFi33bxKnIXkzcBdwx9mUVRs5OzveOoPLYFyBYF7JaZPfjwRe.aj7GZEnB6G9Gr3Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T05:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "Global Mobile Backend as a Service (BaaS) Market New Study of Trend and Forecast Report 2017-2022", "text": "Major Market Regions Continue to Thrive The global Mobile Backend as a Service (BaaS) market has been segmented on the basis of country such as the United States, Canada, Mexico, Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Russia, China, Japan, India, Korea, Southeast Asia, Australia, Brazil, the Middle East, and Africa.

There are guys in my fraternity who\u2019d be going crazy up there because it\u2019s not like anyone would be able to find them once they left.\u201d\nHaley stared at him. Giving both of them a quick look, Camille began to talk, \u201cIs anyone planning anything tonight? I think the last think we did together was watch movies in Vaughn\u2019s room.\u201d\nTravis shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think there\u2019s a group thing tonight. The summer just got started so they\u2019re trying to build up the group before they put us through hell.\u201d\nAmy walked up with her own tray and sat next to Camille, red hair in a ponytail and wearing exercise clothing. Haley could smell that she\u2019d just come from working out\u2014just like the rest of them.\nSitting down, Amy smiled, \u201cWell, at least there shouldn\u2019t be dragons this year.\u201d\nTravis laughed. \u201cYeah. Haley, when you\u2019re missing Nick, think about that. It makes everything sound better. I wonder what Marcus is doing? Probably drawing everything. The guy barely ever stops drawing. I think he might be the only guy I know who\u2019d rather draw a superhero than be one.\u201d\nCamille smiled. \u201cIs Marcus any good at drawing?\u201d\nTravis stopped eating for a second. \u201cHard to say. He\u2019s pretty good at drawing people who are wearing costumes, but he doesn\u2019t do sensitive people staring sensitively into the distance pictures. His drawings have people punching each other.\u201d\nIn her head, Haley thanked Camille for changing the topic. She couldn\u2019t take much more of Travis\u2019 support.\n* * *\nHideaway \nI let Kals into our rooms. She looked around as she followed me inside. \u201cThis place needs a party. Without people, it just looks abandoned.\u201d\n\u201cIs that the way it normally is?\u201d I watched as she ran her fingers across the top of one of the room\u2019s desks.\n\u201cAbandoned? No. We let guests stay here, but we also use it with new arrivals. Oh, and during the epidemic the colony had back when I first arrived a few years ago, this was one of the hospitals.\u201d\nWe stopped next to the suite\u2019s table. Cassie and I exchanged glances and I said, \u201cEpidemic?\u201d\nKals nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. It came in with our group of settlers. I don\u2019t know where it came from but it spread before Iolan could stop it and it kept people down for days. I don\u2019t know if it had an official name or if it was one of those new viruses that show up every now and again. I just know I could barely move for a few days and my head hurt bad enough that I could barely think. It was miserable.\u201d\n\u201cI hope we don\u2019t bring that home,\u201d I told Cassie.\nKals pulled out a chair and sat down next to the table. \u201cI doubt you will. From what I remember, if you contracted it, you got sick and it didn\u2019t take long. But never mind that, what was Maru telling you about me?\u201d\n\u201cNot a lot\u2014just that you might try to command me to take you away from here, leaving the colony without protection.\u201d\nHer mouth compressed into a hard line and her cheeks reddened. \u201cWell, fuck him. I\u2019ve never tried to do anything like that. He\u2019s stopped complaining about what I actually do, and started making things up. If thought for half a second that it would do any good, I\u2019d tell my mom, but she always listens to him anyway.\u201d\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "haley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "camille", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "travis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaclyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cassie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vaughn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kals", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:04.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "16e50cb82360d7c611278e2c7f8cbdb1ad256fd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVp.DKH4T0GljUM2yhGVPZplgwPo7Zi6GauX.r9rHhZBO8PCBqPXtcmyunZyL6xbzLu.XbEx9S1BhELRBeecEhxXWTQF0kJGQk-", "site_full": "news.bestnaira.com", "site": "bestnaira.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/bestnaira/BTbw", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest News in Nigeria", "title": "Kwara Assembly tackles corpse exhumation", "title_full": "Kwara Assembly tackles corpse exhumation", "published": "2017-12-07T01:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "16e50cb82360d7c611278e2c7f8cbdb1ad256fd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVp.DKH4T0GljUM2yhGVPZplgwPo7Zi6GauX.r9rHhZBO8PCBqPXtcmyunZyL6xbzLu.XbEx9S1BhELRBeecEhxXWTQF0kJGQk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BestNaira", "published": "2017-12-07T01:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Kwara Assembly tackles corpse exhumation", "text": "Thu Dec 7th, 2017 - Kwara \nBy Demola Akinyemi \nI LORIN\u2014 Disturbed by the high rate of ritual killings and exhumation of corpses in Ilorin, Kwara State House of Assembly has said it will work to restore the sanctity of the ancient city. \nSpeaker of the House, Dr. Ali Ahmed, who lamented that the issues were becoming a daily occurrence and increasin-gly embarrassing to every responsible indigenes and residents of Ilorin, pledged to rally his colleagues towards ensuring that the act was stamped out of Ilorin and Kwara State in general. \nAhmad made the pledge when he played host to Concerned Muslims of Kwara State. \nEarlier, leader of the delegation, Professor Lanre Badmus of the University of Ilorin, said the group was working on presenting a bill to the House to ensure that the city was rid of social ills and urged the legislators to assist.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "demola akinyemi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lanre badmus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ali ahmed", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kwara assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kwara state house of assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kwara state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of ilorin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kwara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ilorin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:04.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c127caafe068bf98c7a04b2d9886a159bf0b90e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyVShB5oRwdx8INb0ScJlHuaQ4KyQrngb8QvYBz4MBQhcQd7QkxXuy44s044PJ7LmvPY66MwIzwGSWYjyHUQO_T", "site_full": "farawayeyes1.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://farawayeyes1.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Far Away Series", "title": "DECEMBER DJ AN IWSG POST", "title_full": "DECEMBER DJ AN IWSG POST", "published": "2017-12-06T19:53:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2769eaa71460e17ad0a0d23c6b7f957da088cf77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyVShB5oRwdx8INb0ScJlHuaQ4KyQrngb8QvYBz4MBQhcQd7QkxXuy44s044PJ7LmvPY66MwIzwGWZACE9qGvx.3NFJPPkNPbs-", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "dolorah", "published": "2017-12-07T10:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hope you are feeling better FAE.

Teaching your child the right oral care at an early age is an investment in his health that will pay dividends for life. You can start by having an example; Getting good care of your own teeth sends an information that oral health is something that should be considered. And anything that makes caring your teeth fun, like brushing with your child or letting you choose your own toothbrush, encourages proper oral care. To help your children protect their teeth and gums and greatly reduce their risk of developing tooth decay, teach them to follow these simple steps: Brush twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste accepted by ADA to remove the plaque, the adhesive film on the teeth that is the leading cause of tooth decay. Floss daily to remove plaque from between your teeth and below the gum line, before it hardens into tartar. Once the tartar has formed, it can only be removed with professional cleaning. Eat a well-planned diet that limits sugary foods, which produce plaque acids that produce tooth decay. When you eat these foods, try to eat them with your food instead of as a snack: the extra saliva produced during a meal helps to rinse the food out of your mouth. Use dental products that contain fluoride, including toothpaste. Make sure your children's drinking water is fluoridated. If your water supply; public, well or bottled does not contain fluoride, your dentist or paediatrician can prescribe daily fluoride supplements. Take your child to the dentist for regular check-ups. \nWhat brushing techniques can I show to my son? You may want to supervise your children until they get used to these simple steps: Use an ADA-accepted fluoride toothpaste the size of a pea. Be careful that your child does not swallow toothpaste. With a soft bristle brush, first brush the inner surface of each tooth, where the plate can accumulate more. Brush gently back and forth. Clean the external surfaces of each tooth. Tilt the brush along the external line of the gum. Brush gently back and forth. Brush the chewing surface of each tooth. Brush gently back and forth. Use the tip of the brush to clean behind each front tooth, both above and below. It's always fun to brush your tongue! \nWhen should my child start flossing? Because dental floss removes food particles and plaque between missing teeth, you should floss your children after age 4. By the time they are 8 years old, most children can start flossing on their own. \nWhat are dental sealants and how do I know if my child needs them? A dental sealant creates a highly effective barrier against decomposition. Sealants are thin plastic coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of a child's permanent teeth, where most cavities are formed. Applying a sealant is not painful and can be done at a visit to the dentist. Your dentist can tell you if your baby could benefit from a dental sealant. \n how do I know if my child is receiving the correct amount of fluoride? Fluoride is one of the best ways to help prevent tooth decay. A mineral of natural origin, fluoride is combined with tooth enamel to strengthen it. In many municipal water supplies, the correct amount of fluoride is added for the proper development of the tooth. To find out if your water contains fluoride, and how much, call your local water district. If your water supply does not contain fluoride (or enough), your child's paediatrician or dentist may suggest the use of fluoride drops or a mouthwash, in addition to a fluoride toothpaste. \nHow important is the diet for my child's oral health ? A balanced diet is necessary for your child to develop strong teeth that are resistant to decay. In addition to a full range of vitamins and minerals, a child's diet should include a lot of calcium, phosphorus and adequate levels of fluoride. If fluoride is your child's highest protection against tooth decay, then regular snacks can be the biggest enemy. The sugars and carbohydrates found in many foods and snacks such as cookies, candy, dried fruits, sodas, pretzels and chips are combined with the plaque on the teeth to create acids. These acids attack the tooth enamel and can cause tooth decay. \nEach \"plaque attack\" can last up to 20 minutes after a meal or snack is over. Even a small bite can create plaque acids. Therefore, it is best to limit the snacks between meals. \nWhat should I do if my child breaks or hits a tooth? With any damage to your child's mouth, you should reach your dentist immediately. The dentist will want to examine the affected area and determine the appropriate treatment. If your child feels pain from a broken, cracked or chipped the tooth, you should visit the dentist immediately. You may want to give your child an over-the-counter pain reliever until your appointment. If possible, keep any part of the tooth that has broken and bring this with you to the dentist. If a tooth is completely hit by an injury, take the tooth to your dentist as soon as possible. Handle the tooth as little as possible - do not clean or clean the tooth. Store the tooth in water or milk until it reaches a dentist. It is possible for the tooth to be implanted back into your child's mouth, a procedure called reimplantation. \nWorried about your children's dental health?

This has supported a network of 40,000 businesses across the UK, USA , Germany and the Netherlands and helped to create more than 100,000 new jobs.* \nToday's news follows a record November for Funding Circle globally with the business facilitating more than $260 million of lending, including $175 million in the UK (\u00a3130m), $70 million in the US and $15 million in Continental Europe (\u20ac14.5m). Together this has helped thousands of business owners to access fast, transparent finance to grow their businesses, and will lead to an estimated 7,500 new jobs. \nWith US businesses now having accessed more than $1 billion in funding through the platform, Funding Circle becomes the first lending platform anywhere in the world to have facilitated more than $1 billion across two markets. Since 2014, Funding Circle has helped approximately 6,700 US businesses access financing. In a recent survey of US business owners who have borrowed through Funding Circle, 92% said they would come back to Funding Circle for their future business financing needs,** 85% said their experience was faster than their previous borrowing experience, and 73% said it was more transparent.\nSamir Desai , CEO and co-founder of Funding Circle said: \"Today's milestones now make Funding Circle the world's largest small business lending platform by loans outstanding and new monthly originations. We are proud to see that Funding Circle is quickly becoming the first choice for finance for small businesses globally. With revenues growing 80% in 2017 and our UK business cashflow positive, we look forward to continuing to build on the strong foundations we have put in place this year and helping many more thousands of businesses in 2018.\"\nSpeaking about the success of the US business, Sam Hodges , co-founder and US managing director of Funding Circle said: \"Small businesses are responsible for most net new jobs in America***. Yet too many of them can't expand because of difficulty obtaining an affordable loan. Our platform enables growth in the real economy, by more efficiently connecting this unmet credit demand to credit supply in the form of fixed-income investors.\"\nLaunched in 2010, the Funding Circle model has opened up small business lending to a wide range of investors, including 70,000 individuals, local and national government, the European Investment Bank and financial institutions such as pension funds. By improving competition in the market and reducing dependency on bank lending, Funding Circle is helping small businesses to boost their local economies and communities through much-needed job creation. \nBy bringing together industry-leading risk management and cutting-edge technology, creditworthy businesses typically access the capital they need in days rather than months. \nAbout Funding Circle\nFunding Circle ( www.fundingcircle.com ) is the world's leading lending platform for small businesses, matching investors to businesses who want to grow in the UK, U.S. and Europe .
