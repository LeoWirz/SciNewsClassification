Readings above 50 indicate expansion in activity, with the distance from 50 indicating the strength of the increase. \nAi Group head of policy Peter Burn said: \"Activity in the construction sector which has been expanding for most of the year accelerated further in November as higher activity levels in both engineering construction and house building were backed up by a surge in commercial construction. The well-established trend decline in apartment building continued as this sub-sector scaled back from the very high levels of recent years.\u201d \nHe added that the sub-indexes in the Australian PCI point to strong employment growth - November was the seventh consecutive month of expansion - and provide further evidence of a steady pick-up in wages. \u201cWith new orders also in positive territory, the sector looks like closing 2017 on a high,\" he Burn. \nHIA senior economist Shane Garrett said: \"With interest rates set to remain at record lows for longer than expected, the short-term outlook for new home building is stronger and today's Australian PCI\u00ae result for detached house building is evidence of this. Low interest rates and unprecedented migration from overseas are the two most important reasons why new home building reached the highest level on record last year. Looking further ahead, other factors \u2013 including regulatory restrictions \u2013 will force new home building to move lower over the next couple of years. The reduction will be most visible on the apartment side of the market. \nAcross the four construction sub-sectors, engineering construction remained the strongest performer, recording an 11.5-year high (up 3.2 points to 64.1) on the back of rising momentum in the roll-out of major infrastructure projects. House building activity also strengthened due to continuing firm demand and support from a solid backlog of work (up 8.2 points to 61.3). \nThe rate of expansion in commercial construction lifted to its second highest level in 3.5 years (up 9.7 points to 59.8), while apartment building contracted for a fourth consecutive month (up 0.9 points to 47.7). \nOverall construction activity accelerated to its strongest pace in the survey's 12-year history (up 7.9 points to 60.8). This was associated with stronger expansions in new orders (up 3.1 points to 56.7), deliveries from suppliers (up 2.2 points to 56.4) and employment (up 2.9 points to 55.3). \nThe input prices (up 3.8 points to 78.8) and wages (up 2.4 points to 62.3) sub-indexes remained elevated in November. The selling prices sub-index increased by 6.3 points to 59.9, suggesting that rising costs are being passed on, but not broadly given strong market competition.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shane garrett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter burn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian industry group/housing industry association australian performance of construction index", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ai group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:59.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a83247008dcc7efbd84c40eedfa6b0e237a04cfb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFoiUvWicrulIBLjF3POWxU7QSW7KBUF0mM9dyN6HqHVdKPGa0grITwySGNEjAyJwj0ks7Pirkwx_tBPl029_9sU", "site_full": "gulftoday.ae", "site": "gulftoday.ae", "site_section": "http://gulftoday.ae/pages/rss.ashx?id=138", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "LATEST NEWS", "title": "Saudi Arabia denounces US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital", "title_full": "Saudi Arabia denounces US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital", "published": "2017-12-07T12:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a83247008dcc7efbd84c40eedfa6b0e237a04cfb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFoiUvWicrulIBLjF3POWxU7QSW7KBUF0mM9dyN6HqHVdKPGa0grITwySGNEjAyJwj0ks7Pirkwx_tBPl029_9sU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:44:00.000+02:00", "title": "Saudi Arabia denounces US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital", "text": "Saudi Arabia denounces US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital   RIYADH: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has denounced the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Saudi Press Agency, SPA, quoted a statement issued by the Saudi Royal Court as saying that the Kingdom expresses great disappointment on the announcement made by the US President Donald Trump, recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and relocating the United States\u2019 embassy to Jerusalem. The statement said, \u2018Saudi Arabia had previously warned of the serious consequences of such an irresponsible and unwarranted step. The Kingdom expresses it\u2019s denunciation and deep regret that the administration has taken this step, as it represents a great bias against the historic and permanent rights of the Palestinian people in Jerusalem, which have been affirmed by the relevant international resolutions and have been recognised and supported by the international community. \u2018Although this step does not change or infringe upon the inalienable and preserved rights of the Palestinian people in Jerusalem, and other occupied territories, and even though it cannot impose a new reality upon those rights, it does however exemplify a drastic regression in the efforts to move the peace process forward, and is a shift away from the United States\u2019 historically impartial position with regard to the issue of Jerusalem, which will further complicate the Palestinian -Israeli conflict.\u2019 It continued, \u2018The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia hopes that the US administration will reverse this action, and support the international will to enable the Palestinian people to regain their legitimate rights.\u2019 \u2018The Kingdom reaffirms the importance of finding a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause in accordance with the relevant international resolutions, and the Arab Peace Initiative, so that the Palestinian people can regain their legitimate rights, which will strengthen security and stability in the region,\u2019 the statement concluded.

heads up about linking the live and 2 and 5 on the heatlink , I supposed I should have realised that when I saw the terminals\nbut assumed it was linked internally as the Horstmann.\nZone 1 is

Above: click to enlarge \nRijkswaterstaat awarded the OpenIJ consortium a \u20ac600m contract in mid-2015 to design, construct, finance and maintain the new sea lock. Construction is being carried out by a 50/50 joint venture between BAM and VolkerWessels. \nThe loss mainly relates to the redesign of the two caissons that hold the lock doors. The change is needed to prevent torsion and cracking during immersion. The new design has specified reinforced caissons and heavy temporary structures. Recent implementation works have revealed significantly higher costs for specialist materials and equipment and personnel over the prolonged construction period. \nFor BAM, this will lead to an estimated additional project loss of around \u20ac55m in the fourth quarter of this year. As a consequence, BAM expects an adjusted result before tax for the full year 2017, which will be substantially lower compared to 2016. \nBAM CEO Rob van Wingerden said: \u201cWe are very disappointed with this significant cost overrun.

Over the past decade, it has served over 3,000 households with approximately US$190 million in home financing. \nThe company has sourced over $200 million in long-term funding from a formidable list of institutions such as the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, Dutch Development Bank FMO, IFC, Paris-based Proparco, Germany's DEG, ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development, Ghana International Bank and Shelter Afrique. \nIn 2012, the Dubai-based private equity fund Abraaj acquired a majority stake in Ghana Home Loans, now GHL Bank. \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "william yaw owusu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominic adu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max opoku afari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert essien", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freda prempeh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "essien", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bank of ghana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ghana home loans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "proparco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ghl bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ifc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ghana international bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "overseas private investment corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abraaj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dutch development bank fmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecowas bank for investment and development", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ghana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ghana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:09:59.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d3ab520cc7d68b8e017bae6f198eb05a07e84f7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJvGfpIHP1LvVvWAz2FCkVXkC0SjeI7WfD3HE8VZGf_nocx7pSaIf6YaB0GBRm_p8kkJzYu_c7rkSKGYuWK8g9TBff7ciH3HE6", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Supplies-All-Purpose-Cleaners/N-5yc1vZcb2p/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "SHEILA SHINE 10 oz.

The 22 members of the district\u2019s Future Focused Schools team have been discussing options to reconfigure the district. (photo courtesy of the Beverly Hills Unified School District) \nThe district is exploring a reconfiguration of its four K-8 schools as a cost-savings measure, and for more efficient programming. Fifty-four applicants applied for the Future Focused Schools team during an application period running through Sept. 22. The district selected 21 to represent stakeholders throughout the city, and added an additional representative from the high school. \nWith the district\u2019s four middle school model, curricular options, extracurricular options, flexible scheduling of students and teacher collaboration options are limited compared to their potential in another type of configuration, according to a presentation by Superintendent Michael Bregy. \n\u201cThe K-8 model doesn\u2019t work for our district,\u201d said Future Focused Schools member Tristen Walker, an alumna of the district who has two children at El Rodeo School and two at Beverly Hills High School. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it can never work for our district; what it means is that right now that\u2019s the dinosaur and we cannot sustain in this format where we are today. So something has to change.\u201d \nTeam member Jory Lindsay, a teacher at Hawthorne School, added that \u201cthe status quo is not educationally sound.\u201d \n\u201cIn the old days we would just budget cut,\u201d said school board member Lisa Korbatov, who was sworn in as the board\u2019s new president on Dec. 5. \u201cAnd it hurt something or someone.\u201d \nThe team met on Dec. 6, and has additional meetings this month on Dec. 18-19. Team members also began attending PTA and staff meetings at all five of the district\u2019s schools this week. During previous meetings, team members have toured each school and reviewed data to help their decision making process. \n\u201cThis is targeted, this is with thought, this is with strategy,\u201d Korbatov said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do blind budget cuts anymore.\u201d Previous Post", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "luke harold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisa korbatov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tristen walker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korbatov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael bregy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jory lindsay", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "beverly hills high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el rodeo school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beverly hills unified school district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawthorne school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beverly hills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beverly hil", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:00.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a7fd71dba3315e0fd6ac4985e29f8356e29a2c20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSjijWRdDTVARXpZtwE36ThfQk6X3V0QgwiMWsZFpYqDw--", "site_full": "weheartit.com", "site": "weheartit.com", "site_section": "http://weheartit.com/tag/couples.rss", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "couples on we heart it", "title": "Image about love in couples by S2M on We Heart It", "title_full": "Image about love in couples by S2M on We Heart It", "published": "2017-12-07T11:56:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://data.whicdn.com/images/302803829/large.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1473, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a7fd71dba3315e0fd6ac4985e29f8356e29a2c20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSjijWRdDTVARXpZtwE36ThfQk6X3V0QgwiMWsZFpYqDw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "Image about love in couples by S2M on We Heart It", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:00.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "841333e0e993e6db891b8c20f4a1082a23ee8f74", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyuBLEKd9Ac0Hvi8.GdF5olyvqNCigdGqye5BlMP2_dvLAgM2t7Wjjy9A7zdoCP_8uL9wpANy2TtED2wdowjaC38Q4ofT0IDK8-", "site_full": "fmparfum-szolnok.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://fmparfum-szolnok.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Fm parf\u00fcm", "title": "Email from Anna \u2014 Take a look on RussianBrides", "title_full": "Email from Anna \u2014 Take a look on RussianBrides", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "841333e0e993e6db891b8c20f4a1082a23ee8f74", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyuBLEKd9Ac0Hvi8.GdF5olyvqNCigdGqye5BlMP2_dvLAgM2t7Wjjy9A7zdoCP_8uL9wpANy2TtED2wdowjaC38Q4ofT0IDK8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Felber S\u00e1ndor (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "Email from Anna \u2014 Take a look on RussianBrides", "text": "Read new email from Anna View on RussianBrides Dear Guest, Anna has sent you new email.\nAnna, 36 Hello.

Photo by Al Bello/Getty Images Put up an article about how Dallas is looking surprisingly healthy , and of course a new name will pop up on the injury report. Hopefully, he will be cleared to play on Sunday. David Irving wasn\u2019t on hand for the Cowboys\u2019 first practice of Week 14 on Wednesday. Irving suffered a concussion in last week\u2019s win against Washington, and he did not participate in the first practice of the week. He was one of five absentees on Wednesday morning, along with Tyron Smith , La\u2019el Collins, Justin Durant and Orlando Scandrick. Of the names listed, only Scandrick is thought likely to miss the game against the Giants . And more importantly, Sean Lee was not on the injury report at all and was participating in practice. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott throws in practice, says bruised right hand is fine - Todd Archer, ESPN Cowboys fans held their collective breath during the last game when Dak Prescott went into the locker room with an injured right hand. But he came back to complete the game, and said during practice on Wednesday there were no lingering problems. Dak Prescott threw for the first time since bruising his right hand in last week's win against the Washington Redskins and pronounced himself ready to go. \"It felt great,\" Prescott said after Wednesday's practice. \"There weren't any restrictions. It didn't feel like my hand was bothering me or any limitations on throwing the ball or anything.\" Mick Shots: Careful What You Wish For And A Whole Bunch Of \u201cHitching\u201d Posts | Micky Spagnola, Dallas Cowboys Among his collection of thoughts, Spags brings up someone whose contributions were a bit overlooked last week. So they name an Unsung Star each week on The Jason Garrett Show, and Cowboys right tackle La\u2019el Collins took that honor in this past weekend\u2019s edition following the Washington game. And rightfully so. The third-year lineman\u2019s back ailments (bulging disk) kept him out of practice all week, yet he played in the game and basically made \u2019Skins defensive end Ryan Kerrigan disappear. \u201cLC\u201d had a lot to do with the Cowboys rushing for 182 yards and Dak getting sacked only once. So keep an eye on his condition this week. Back still bothering him. Didn\u2019t practice Wednesday. Doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019ll practice Thursday, maybe not even Friday. But boy they\u2019ll need him Sunday after the way he gutted out this past Thursday\u2019s game. Dallas Cowboys: La'el Collins' toughness impresses team | Clarence Hill, Jr, Fort Worth Star-Telegram Collins put in his strong performance against Washington despite not practicing the week before the game. And he might have to do that again. \u201cI was trying to let everything calm down and just go out there and see how it feels warming up. It felt good warming up early on. As the game was going on, kind of sitting around kind of bothered me a little bit. But other than that, I just took it one series at a time.\u201d Collins said he has been dealing with the back injury for about three weeks and it still bothers him. He said the team is trying to manage it as best as possible and surgery is not an option right now. Is Orlando Scandrick's Career Over In Dallas? \u272d Brian Martin, Inside the Star Scandrick looks likely to miss the game this Sunday, but his injury could mean much more. I really think Scandrick\u2019s injury puts his future with the Cowboys in doubt and could possibly end his season. The Cowboys already put him on the trade market before the season got underway and he hasn\u2019t really been playing all that great this season anyway. The Cowboys have been using Scandrick as their right CB when they are in their base defense and then kicking him inside to the slot when they go to their nickel package. But, this is really not necessary any longer with the return of Chidobe Awuzie . Cowboys DE DeMarcus Lawrence proves that technique is everything - Stephen White, SBNation.com This article is called the \"Hoss of the Week\". And Demarcus Lawrence is the subject not just for his considerable talent, but what he does to maximize it. This dude just has impeccable technique in everything he does. I don't care if he is taking on a double team or making a one-on-one pass rush move, you can best believe his technique is always going to be popping. His consistency with his technique is a huge reason why he has been able to be so consistent with his production this year. It doesn't even much matter what team or offensive lineman he is facing every week, because sooner or later great technique will always win. That is evidenced by the fact that Lawrence has had at least one sack in all but three of the first 12 games of this season. In particular, Lawrence is great with his hands, especially as a pass rusher. He just doesn't give offensive linemen much of a chance to get their hands on him. Even when they do, he's constantly working to get them right back off. And the whole time he never stops his feet, which makes it even harder to keep up with him. Dallas Cowboys' Kavon Frazier is getting the chance he always wanted - Todd Archer, Dallas Cowboys Blog- ESPN Another somewhat lesser known story is how the Washington game was something of a breakout for second year safety Kavon Frazier. Frazier played 21 defensive snaps in the Cowboys\u2019 38-14 win against the Washington Redskins, rotating series and situations with Byron Jones. He was credited by the coaches with seven tackles and one tackle for loss. Entering the game, he had never made more than three tackles in a game and never made a tackle for loss in his first two seasons. He has mostly been a special-teams ace. He leads the Cowboys with 10 special-teams tackles. His work as a gunner has played a big part in Chris Jones having 28 punts land inside the 20 and just two go for touchbacks. Sham: Unheralded \u2018Third Phase\u2019 Continues To Be Special For Cowboys | Brad Sham, Dallas Cowboys Sham has some love for the special teams this week. Ryan Switzer had the 83 yard punt return for a score, and Kyle Wilber punched a fumble loose. But those are rare. What has been much more common this season are plays like Kavon Frazier downing a punt inside the 1. Some statistics in football are misleading. When you see a team\u2019s official ranking on offense or defense, for instance, that\u2019s based on total yardage. Not points or first downs or turnovers, just yards. Yards are nice and everything, but they can tell a misleading story. Here are some that are less misleading and more meaningful: Dallas this week is fourth in kickoff return average and 10th in punt returns. Even better, they\u2019re number one in opponent\u2019s punt return average. Ask Dak Prescott and Scott Linehan if it helps playing offense when you know if you don\u2019t score, if you\u2019ll just get the ball to midfield, your punt team will flip the field for you. That\u2019s how you win field position, and usually if you win field position, you\u2019ve got a great chance to win the game. Dallas Cowboys: Why Dallas Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett is still on the hot seat | David Moore, SportsDay The New York Giants are in turmoil and that leads many to expect a fairly easy win for Dallas. But in 2010, the roles were reversed, with Jason Garrett coaching his first game as an interim head coach, against the Giants. And if you remember, the Cowboys won that one. The parallels to the start of Garrett's head coaching career are hard to escape. The Giants have made a coaching change as the team prepares for Sunday's game with the Cowboys. Garrett is familiar with the concept. He succeeded Wade Phillips as the Cowboys' head coach seven years ago heading into a game with the Giants. It should come as no surprise to anyone who has caught a Garrett news conference or two through the years that he's reluctant to draw any comparisons between himself and Steve Spagnuolo, who has taken over for Ben McAdoo.

Currently, only 1 percent of goods procured globally fall in this category.\"I want to thank the UAE government and the Emirati leadership who have played a pivotal role in different ways,\" said Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the Under Secretary General and Executive Director of UN Women.\"We are left with only 13 years before 2030 by which time we should have reached substantive equality. We are making a case and argument that gender equality is not an open ended journey; it has an expiry date. What would the world look like in 2030 if it lived up to the expectations of the Agenda 2030? Violence against women will not be a norm; society will not tolerate child marriage or trafficking. Everywhere, we will have mechanisms to ensure these practices do not thrive. In 2030, we will want to ensure that equal pay is a norm, and women enjoy greater representation in a diverse set of economic and leadership roles. Is this too much to ask, or is this rocket science,\" she added.The importance role of technology specifically in addressing women\u2019s entrepreneurship issues were highlighted, in context of its role in creation and marketing of products, accessing finance, increasing the reach of companies and enhancing profitability.WEEGS raised the bar on the Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) by being a platform where 20 organisations, public and private, demonstrated leadership on gender equality by adopting of two WEPs each under the \u2018WEEGS Pledge\u2019. The summit emphasised that this initiative was a step towards ensuring that by 2030, businesses around the world will promote gender equality, and empower women in the workplace, marketplace and community as a norm and not an exception. Big international conglomerates like Ernst and Young, Mubadala Investment Company, Citi, Accenture, and Procter and Gamble (P&G) have signed up to WEPs at the summit.Joelle Zilliox, IMEA Purchase Leader at P&G, shared the company\u2019s experience, saying, \"P&G wanted to expand diversity and inclusion beyond the walls of their offices for a reason. These qualities are rooted in our culture with a small example being the 95,000 people who have come together from all over the world to make up our workforce. Through bringing our external suppliers into this ambit of diversity and inclusion, we have sourced goods and services worth USD 2 billion from diverse and minority women-owned businesses in the US and Canada. This number is growing. Why? Because our findings show that companies that run effective supply diversity programmes report increased profitability. Our internal data shows that women-owned and diverse suppliers actually perform better than the average supplier base.\"The final session of the two-day event , dedicated to the WEPs, and titled \u2018Driving WEPs Implementation: From Promise to Practice,\u2019 sheds light on the fact that with 1,655 countries signed up to WEPs so far, the ball may be rolling, but there is a long way to go.Dr. Enas Makkawi, Director of Women, Family and Children's Department at the League of Arab States said, \"We have Japan and Turkey as our largest contributors but the figures are peanuts compared to what they should be. From issues such as recruitment and fair pay to encouraging suppliers to expand their operations to women owned and managed businesses, the pillars of WEP are not only workable, they are positively beneficial.\"\"The responses are simply that dealing with a gender balanced workforce results in better company performance,\" Dr. Enas Makkawi added.Abdullah Al Saleh Undersecretary, Ministry of Economy, UAE, attended the closing ceremony and emphasised that gender equality is one of the biggest goals around the world, especially when all sectors in the market are increasingly interdependent and require diverse viewpoints and perspectives to enable innovation.He said, \"This is an international platform that furthers the vision and philosophy of the UAE with regards to the empowerment of women. I would like to express deepest thanks on behalf of the UAE Ministry of Economy to His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohamed Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah, for his patronage and supporting women to reach the highest positions in society and economy.\"\"Legislations will be the main aspect for developing women\u2019s skills and enabling their economic empowerment and bridging the gap between the two genders. UAE is trying every day to set an example. A few months ago, the UAE launched an equality booklet for the public sector, which will help companies to take the steps required to implement the highest standards and best practices of bringing about equality in its true sense. We are aiming to become the #1 country in gender balance internationally by 2021,\" he added.In her closing remarks, Reem BinKaram, Director of NAMA Women Advancement Establishment, said, \"After two days full of exciting experiences and discussions, we have found effective ways to lead this drive that will change the reality of women in the world, and enable her to take her rightful place in society. This summit has opened a huge floor for many challenges we face as women. In 20 specialised panels, we have discussed the challenges that face gender equality and hinder women\u2019s participation in many sectors of the economy, especially the non-traditional ones. We hope that the recommendations and commitments made here will bring tangible changes for women.\"This summit came up with enlightening projections that are expected to elevate the cause of women in the economy and society. The organisers of the event hope that by the next edition in 2019, many recommendations will be implemented and tangible results and success stories will be shared.The first edition of WEEGS was organised by the NAMA Women Advancement Establishment (NAMA) and United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), and held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohamed Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council Ruler of Sharjah, and his wife, Her Highness Sheikha Jawaher bint Mohammed Al Qasimi, Chairperson of NAMA Women Advancement Establishment and Honorary Patron for Global Women\u2019s Inclusion, to achieve the United Nation\u2019s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in September 2015.WAM", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sultan bin mohamed al qasimi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phumzile mlambo-ngcuka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enas makkawi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheikha jawaher bint mohammed al qasimi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reem binkaram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emirati", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "uae ministry of economy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ernst", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mubadala investment company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accenture", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "league of arab states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "procter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "p&g", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations entity for gender equality", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of economy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "citi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "children's department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sharjah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharjah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:02.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c3e92ff8e5b98b976d640e0a60c36d4c01077d91", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFenCYFp627NZGJxVdNFDfxJDSC6K4kLRt0E0OJAMNcLqONkNo3l9RfWXXwFUjmX.3CNX411irypd2G6pgNQnegc16S4YFHfVEZwnq4M2ao.elhhqYwiqB6JzOKskpEoH6a916Zu0xd0NVZq6jnb9lsZOqJQa.JhyqvAdjG97pm0Yso.ByxX4LNAtXWrrwn1bv6", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "http://www.lazada.com.my/discovertech/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Discover Tech - Buy Discover Tech at Best Price in Malaysia | www.lazada.com.my", "title": "YongNuo YN-560 IV Flash Speedlite for DSLR Cameras + Color Filter Gels Band", "title_full": "YongNuo YN-560 IV Flash Speedlite for DSLR Cameras + Color Filter Gels Band | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2016-11-09T11:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f364f84eefa3e3c43679452f79859dc99e3f06e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DClj1CJSuf1w8zjfkOEFenCYFp627NZGJxVdNFDfxJDSC6K4kLRt0E0OJAMNcLqONkNo3l9RfWXXwFUjmX.3CNX411irypd2G6pgNQnegc16S4YFHfVEZwnq4M2ao.elhhqYwiqB6JzOKskpEoH6a916Zu0xd0NVZq6jnb9lsZOqJQa.JhyqvAdjG97pm0Yso.ByxX4LNApe7uxOQMmqww0AXd.fEkJU-", "ord_in_thread": 19, "author": "Ong M.", "published": "2017-11-30T16:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "Five Stars", "text": "Have been using YongNuo for a few years.

However, after Boeing lodged a legal complaint accusing Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier of dumping commercial planes on the U.S. market, Canadian government officials \u2014 including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \u2014 put a hold on the purchase and began looking at other options.\nOfficials from Canada\u2019s Department of National Defence said they would not comment on the rumors. Public Services and Procurement Canada, which would handle any purchase, did not issue a comment on the report.\nBoeing also declined to comment on the Reuters report.\nDuring an exclusive interview with Defense News on December 2, Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense and Security, referenced the company\u2019s long history with the Royal Canadian Air Force, which flies CF-18 Hornets. However, she stopped short of saying she believed problems with Canada could be resolved.\n\u201cAs with any of our customer\u2019s decisions, we are there for the long term and in Canada we have had a proud history with them for decades. They are going to make the right decision that is right for them,\u201d she said.\nSpeaking to Defense News last month, RCAF commander Lt. Gen. Michael Hood said that if the service bought used Hornets from Australia, the Canadian government would have to invest in extending the lives of the airframes, which are meeting their structural end. L3 Technologies, which has worked on the CF-18s previously, would likely pick up that contract \u2014 further shutting out Boeing.\nThe decision to reverse course on the Super Hornet deal could have colossal implications for Canada\u2019s future fighter competition. When the government announced the Super Hornet interim buy in 2016, it was widely seen as a rebuke of Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 and a sign that the Super Hornet was on a fast track to win Canada\u2019s competition.\nContinued tensions between Canada and Boeing shot a hole through that vision, bolstering not only the chances of Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35, but also the Eurofighter Typhoon, Saab Gripen E, and Dassault Rafale.\n(David Pugliese in Canada and Aaron Mehta in Washington contributed to this report.)\nBoeing May Lose Canada\u2019s Super Hornet Order, Yet Jet\u2019s Outlook is Bright\nBy Marcus Weisgerber\nDefense One\nDecember 5, 2017\nIf Canada scraps its planned $5.2 billion purchase of new F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and buys used Australian fighter jets instead, it will be a blow to Boeing and the Trump administration. Yet the outlook for the American-made warplane has brightened this year.\nCiting three sources \u201cfamiliar with the matter,\u201d Reuters reported Tuesday that the Royal Canadian Air Force would buy earlier-generation F/A-18 Hornets from Australia, which is shedding them to move up to the newer model.\nThe move deepens the rift between the Canadian government and Boeing. The two have been locked in a nasty trade dispute over Canada\u2019s Bombardier C Series passenger jetliner, which Boeing and the U.S. government say was improperly subsidized by Ottawa.\n\u201cRegarding Canada or any other customer, we\u2019re here to support them,\u201d said Leanne Caret, the CEO of Boeing Defense, Space and Security, asked about the potential Super Hornet sale on Saturday at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California. \u201cWe have a long history and we are proud to have a partnership with the government of Canada and we look forward to supporting them in whatever decisions they make.\u201d\nA Boeing defense spokesman declined to comment on the Reuters report because the Canadian government has made no announcement about the potential sale.\nIn April, Boeing sued Bombardier, claiming that it was dumping its new jetliner into the U.S. market at \u201cabsurdly low prices\u201d. In September, the U.S. Commerce Department recommended a 220 percent tariff on C Series airliners sold to U.S. air carriers. In October, Commerce\u2019s International Trade Administration recommended an additional 80 percent tariff. A final ruling on the tariffs by the International Trade Commission is expected in February.\nIn June, Caret told Defense One that it was \u201ca Boeing company decision\u201d to challenge Bombardier. \u201cWe have been very thoughtful and pragmatic as we approached this situation,\u201d she said, noting the company\u2019s nearly century-long sales record with Canada.\n\u201cWe view them as a key partner for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe look forward to continuing the dialog and continuing to demonstrate the capability that the Supers provide and why that is the right choice for them for their interim solution.\u201d\nFrom Boeing\u2019s standpoint, losing an order for 18 Super Hornets is a small price to pay for protecting its far more lucrative sales of airliners to U.S. airlines. If the tariffs are put in place, it could prevent Bombardier\u2019s C Series from biting into the Boeing 737\u2019s share of the U.S. market. In the first three quarters of 2017, Boeing delivered 381 new 737s to U.S. and international air carriers.\nOne year ago, things were looking up for the Super Hornet in Canada. Justin Trudeau\u2019s government decided to scrap immediate plans to buy the expensive F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Royal Canadian Air Force, which already flies older F/A-18 Hornets, decided to buy a relatively small number of Super Hornets \u2014 cheaper than the F-35 \u2014 while it figured out a long-term replacement plan.\nBut even if Canada bows out of a Super Hornet deal, the jet\u2019s overall sales outlook has improved this year. After running low on orders in late 2016, Boeing found a customer for a newer, more advanced version of the Super Hornet: the U.S. Navy.\nThe Navy is planning to buy 80 of the jets in coming years to meet a shortfall in aircraft carrier-based warplanes and that may just be a start. Boeing believes the Navy needs a total of 150 jets to meet a shortfall, according to Dan Gillian, Boeing\u2019s F/A-18 and EA-18G program manager.\nBoeing also expecting orders to extend the planned service life of about 600 existing Navy Super Hornets from 6,000 to 9,000 hours. The work will also update the cockpit and its networking capabilities, and install new fuel tanks to extend the plane\u2019s range. Each plane\u2019s upgrade costs about $5 million, Gillian said.\n\u201cIt has quickly gone from PowerPoint and paper to real engineering that is going to lead to real flying airplanes next year,\u201d he said in an interview last week.\nFurther, the firm expects to finalize a 28-plane deal with Kuwait \u201cvery soon,\u201d Gillian said, and sees potential for Super Hornet sales in Finland, Switzerland, India, and Germany.\n\u201cIt seems like there is a lot going on internationally right now,\u201d he said.\nBoeing builds about two Super Hornets per month at its St. Louis plant. At the current rate, the production line will remain hot though the mid-2020s, Gillian said.

The rallying calls of 2011 for democratic and inclusive governance now echo the interests of the \u201cFriends of Syria\u201d group, an alliance of mainly Western and Gulf countries, who say reconstruction support must hinge on a \u201ccredible political process leading to a genuine political transition that can be supported by a majority of the Syrian people.\u201d \nBut Syria is prioritizing aid from donor countries like China and Russia that are unlikely to condition aid on political reforms. On the contrary, they would help rebuild the country in the image of the regime and its international and regional patrons. \nThe 2011 uprisings provoked a new, open debate about previously taboo subjects. Discussions that were once off-limits even in private suddenly flared into the open. \nA resurgent Assad regime has once again silenced public discussion of national identity and belonging, but a vigorous conversation continues in the Syrian diaspora. \nMany exiles insist that national Syrian identity in the future must make room for inclusive citizenship and openly contested politics. For now, however, Syria\u2019s rulers have reestablished control over the national narrative, sidelining questions about identity and politics that were raised by the revolutionary opposition. \nAlmost all of the interviewees said that the opposition living abroad is fragmented, and that activists are unable to regroup at this point in time. \nMoustapha insisted that it wasn\u2019t indifference, but rather the fact that \u201cpeople have paid such a high price and now they\u2019re worn down. They\u2019re more concerned about achieving things on an individual level and not on a collective level.\u201d \nReferring to exiled Syrians that participated in the uprisings, Moustapha said, \u201cThere is a sense of alienation if you want to talk about the nation compared to before when the nation was something so near and so close \u2026 Today there are many Syrians, and they are all islands.\u201d \nOpinion: The Deliberate Targeting of Civilians Led to the Eastern Ghouta Crisis \n\nZaki Mehchy, a founder and researcher at the Syrian Center for Policy Research, says that keeping a connection with the nation is not contingent on physically being there, but on having the goal to rebuild it in everyone\u2019s image. \nFor him, belonging is nothing without a goal or a cause. How our pro-uprising interviewees recall the Syria of 2011 is indicative of what they hope for in a post-war Syria scenario. For the time being, however, some have replaced that with a fantastical concept of the nation. \nStill, others remain pessimistic about the future of Syria, and about their own chances of returning. Khansa and Khaled from Qusayr, who were not critical of Assad and longed for their lives as they were before the uprisings, believed that their homes had been either destroyed or taken by loyalists. \nExplaining how people in her refugee settlement talk about the future, Khansa said that \u201c\u201csome people are depressed, some people don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to go back or not \u2026 They say we won\u2019t go back but we hope our children can. The future is far away. Hope is far away.\u201d \nMany Syrians living outside their homeland say they will continue to debate identity, community, sect, and nationalism. They intend to challenge an exclusionary master narrative written by the Assad regime. \nHowever, the opposition has lost any tangible ability to challenge the government in Damascus, and seems limited for now to carry on their fight in the realm of ideas and culture. For the foreseeable future, there will be competing Syrians, \u201cislands\u201d with different politics and national identities \u2013 one under Assad and many beyond. \n\nThis article has been adapted from its original source.

Of these, 569 were operated by government agents. \nThe area has been the scene of inter-ethnic violence for the past 20 years, as groups clash for control of mining and other resources. \nTruckers in North Kivu alone are shaken down at roadblocks to the tune of about a million euros annually. \n\u201cFinding a Congolese road without a roadblock is a challenge \u2013- basically, everything that moves, is taxed,\u201d said Peer Schouten, IPIS research coordinator and the study\u2019s lead author. \n\u201cWomen going to market, farmers accessing fields, traders taking to the road\u2026 We were surprised at the sheer density of roadblocks. They indicate the extent of structural extortion in Congo.

Der Lades\u00e4ulen-Betreiber Fastned will nun von den Niederlanden nach Deutschland expandieren. Interessant ist dabei das flexible Preismodell. \n\nNeben Norwegen gelten die Niederlande als weiteres Beispiel, wie sich Elektromobilit\u00e4t in Europa durchsetzen kann. Zwar gab es zuletzt einige Fehlanreize, etwa die staatliche Subventionierung ineffizienter Plug-In-Hybride - mittlerweile hat die Regierung das aber korrigiert. Reine E-Fahrzeuge steigen weiter in der K\u00e4ufergunst, vor allem weil man mit ihnen als Dienstwagen erheblich Steuern sparen kann. \n\nMit seiner kleinen Fl\u00e4che hat das Land nat\u00fcrlich bei der E-Mobilit\u00e4t einen Vorteil, weil ein fl\u00e4chendeckendes Ladenetz leichter zu installieren ist. Durch eine koordinierte F\u00f6rderung - etwa der Installation von Lades\u00e4ulen entsprechend den Vorschl\u00e4gen von E-Auto-Besitzern selbst - gelingt das zudem besser als in Deutschland, wo es eine Vielzahl unkoordiniert nebenher laufender Lade-Initiativen gibt. Der Lades\u00e4ulen-Betreiber Fastned will zumindest das Laden im \u00f6ffentlichen Raum einfacher machen und im kommenden Jahr nach Deutschland expandieren. Bislang betreibt das Unternehmen 63 Stationen in den Niederlanden. \n\nNeu ist dabei, dass man zum Aufladen seines Stromers keine Karte oder Vertr\u00e4ge mit Energieversorgern braucht. Auch eine App sei nicht n\u00f6tig, so das Unternehmen - der Ladevorgang beginne sofort nach dem Anst\u00f6pseln wie bei einer normalen Tankstelle. Fastned setzt \u00e4hnlich wie bei einem Handy-Vertrag auf verschiedene Abo-Modelle mit oder ohne Grundgeb\u00fchr, bei denen dann der Strompreis variiert. Die Firma hofft, in Deutschland die gleiche Preisstruktur anzuwenden wie in den Niederlanden - noch ist das aber nicht fix. \n\n\"Wir wollen vor allem das Laden pro Kilowattstunde (kWh) berechnen und nicht pro Minute\", hei\u00dft es von dem Unternehmen. \nBezahlt werde mit Kreditkarte oder EC-Karte, der eingekaufte Strom stamme zu 100 Prozent aus regenerativen Energien. \nGeladen wird mit mit drei m\u00f6glichen Steckerarten: CCS, CHAdeMO sowie Typ 2 (Wechselstrom mit maximal 43 kW). \n\nDie Preisstruktur soll folgenderma\u00dfen aussehen: Laden ohne Grundgeb\u00fchr: 59 Cent pro kWh Grundgeb\u00fchr von 9,90 Euro pro Monat bei einem kWh-Preis von 35 Cent Grundgeb\u00fchr von 29,99 Euro pro Monat bei einem kWh-Preis von 19 Cent \n\n2. ist g\u00fcnstiger als 1. ab der 42.ten kWh. \n3. ist g\u00fcnstiger als 1. ab der 75.ten kWh. \n3. ist g\u00fcnstiger als 2. ab der 126.ten kWh. \n\nKosten f\u00fcr 100kWh bei den drei Systemen: \n1. 59,00\u20ac", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "auch eine app", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cent grundgeb\u00fchr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "preis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "durch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kosten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tesla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grundgeb\u00fchr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laden ohne grundgeb\u00fchr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "der lades\u00e4ulen-betreiber fastned", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ccs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greencars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutschland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:10:04.094+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6c3d89c3f375d92cf0160b4081b0f906360a386a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7SkXc1PrQ_PiQHZOBtZv5bOX0oEAGRrPyv4iDLo1qgLa1CGEg.t2ywYhSJ3F25Zj0DQ8VzoFJ5kf4.pNhmZk7qxsl7AG_PabxiG4Kwqpk6qN.shdA86rHdQkgESNuwxXU4y.adEAPtpcD7p1FCNl0P", "site_full": "www.tigerdroppings.com", "site": "tigerdroppings.com", "site_section": "http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/coaching-changes/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Football Coaching Changes | TigerDroppings.com ", "title": "Jimmy Hyams (the real one): Tennessee has offered the HC job to Jeremy Pruitt | Page 2", "title_full": "Jimmy Hyams (the real one): Tennessee has offered the HC job to Jeremy Pruitt | Page 2 | TigerDroppings.com", "published": "2017-12-07T07:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6c3d89c3f375d92cf0160b4081b0f906360a386a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OhsWueXAaBCumvGd7658wwLfXV37N8W7SkXc1PrQ_PiQHZOBtZv5bOX0oEAGRrPyv4iDLo1qgLa1CGEg.t2ywYhSJ3F25Zj0DQ8VzoFJ5kf4.pNhmZk7qxsl7AG_PabxiG4Kwqpk6qN.shdA86rHdQkgESNuwxXU4y.adEAPtpcD7p1FCNl0P", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Shaft Williams", "published": "2017-12-07T07:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "Jimmy Hyams (the real one): Tennessee has offered the HC job to Jeremy Pruitt | Page 2", "text": "What does it matter?

I've lost two in rapid succession & the only reason I haven't lost a third is because I've chained the bastard on, but even so at the end of a 10 mile ride I'll find it hanging by it's chain & the inside of my right thigh oily : ( Has anyone else had these problems ? The first cap I lost was the original cap & the others are recent purchases but good quality English made ones, at around $55 a pop it's getting a bit expensive !\nEschew Obfuscation !\n #717531 - 12/03/17 4:54 am Re: Oil tank cap on 650SS keeps coming off !

The caps are not the problem, it's the bike. Keep the cap and send the bike up up to me in Mackay. I'll dispose of it for you.\nCan you try an O ring around the threads ( if it's threaded ) or try cutting a fibre washer out of gasket paper or cork. Has the cap got tangs on it that you can tweak or bend?\nGinge\n#717536 - 12/03/17 5:33 am Re: Oil tank cap on 650SS keeps coming off !

Even if it works loose, the cap should not be able to undo far enough to come adrift, because the cap's claws should stay engaged with the bayonet fitting on the collar.\nCould be that your new caps are not engaging the bayonet collar of the tank, or perhaps the collar is worn.\n..

The bike runs very smoothly too so I don't think vibration would be playing a major role in this !\nEschew Obfuscation ! #717634 - 12/04/17 5:39 am Re: Oil tank cap on 650SS keeps coming off !

Sounds similar to the Triumph oil cap. Spring loaded with a knurled outer ring.\nIs the collar and neck on the tank out of round? Just an afterthought.\nLast edited by Ginge; 12/04/17 5:41 am .
