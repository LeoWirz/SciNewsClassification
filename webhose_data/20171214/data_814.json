Photo: Geo News screen grab \nKARACHI: Pak Sarzameen Party Chairperson Mustafa Kamal claimed that a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz supported the workers of Muttahida Qaumi Movement involved in china cutting. \nWhile speaking to media in Karachi, Kamal also alleged that MQM workers switched around papers and engaged in china cutting on August 22, last year. One party was formed in MQM after china cutting, he added. \n\u201cPML-N is supporting MQM,\u201d he said, adding that PML-N leaders like people such as Farooq Sattar as they are important to stay in power. \nKamal also alleged that MQM-Pakistan in involved in widespread corruption. \u201cWe found out yesterday that Hyderabad mayor is involved in Rs400 million corruption scandal,\u201d he said, adding Hyderabad mayor takes a six percent share on each tender. \nHe remarked that MQM is spending the nation\u2019s money in their rallies. \u201cNation\u2019s money being used to fund rallies.\u201d \nMunicipal authorities are being investigated for many corruption scandals, he said, demanding that Hyderabad mayor should also be investigated. Sattar requested establishment to bring us to the table: Mustafa Kamal \nMustafa Kamal tells Farooq Sattar he is ready for talks for the sake of lasting peace in Karachi \nPSP and MQM had come into limelight last month after they announced to regroup under 'one name, one election symbol.' However, just a day after the announcement, cracks developed in the relations between the two parties. \nDismayed at the response over the alliance, Sattar lashed out at PSP chair and announced to quit politic. However, he reversed the decision at the behest of his mother. Sattar kept reiterating that the partnership between two parties is an alliance, however PSP leaders said that it was a merger. \nReacting to Sattar's statement, Kamal remarked that he met with Sattar because the latter had requested the establishment to bring the two to the table. \nKamal added that Sattar has been giving the impression that whatever decisions PSP takes is at the behest of the establishment. \n\u201cSattar has been meeting us through the establishment since eight months,\u201d he said, saying that the developments are not just 48 hours-long. \nSince then, the relations between the two political parties have soured.

FILE PHOTO: The leader of Turkey's pro-Kurdish opposition Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) Selahattin Demirtas, makes a speech during a rally in Istanbul, Turkey, June 5, 2016. REUTERS/Osman Orsal/File Photo Selahattin Demirtas, the co-leader of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (HDP), was not allowed to appear in court for security reasons and refused to take part via video link. A state prosecutor demanded he remain in jail for trial. A charismatic former human rights lawyer who was once dubbed the \u201cKurdish Obama\u201d by some in the international, Demirtas was arrested on Nov. 4 last year, one of more than a dozen HDP lawmakers who were arrested in a crackdown following last year\u2019s attempted coup. A crowd of several hundred gathered to show support for Demirtas in snowy weather outside the court near the capital Ankara. They joined hands and danced around small fires, singing songs in Kurdish. \u201cDemirtas is our honour,\u201d they chanted. Demirtas and other detained HDP members are mostly accused of links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group, which has conducted a decades-old insurgency in which 40,000 people have been killed and which is deemed a terrorist group by the United States, Turkey and Europe. All deny the charges. The HDP is the third-largest party in Turkey\u2019s parliament. Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended and roughly 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial since the failed coup. Rights groups and some Western allies say Erdogan has used the putsch as a pretext to quash dissent. The HDP says as many as 5,000 of its members have been detained. Erdogan says such measures were necessary given the danger represented by the putsch in which 250 people were killed.

Only \u20ac35 per night.\nThe Airbnb was situated right on the Neretva River and just south of the Stari Most and had a perfect view of the bridge from the balcony.\nAt about 2:30pm I went for a walk through the Old Town, with plenty of other tourists about.\nSpicy beef kebab and a bottle of European Fanta (i.e. made with real orange juice) for lunch at a local restaurant.\nLooking up at a diver about to take the plunge into the cool water of the Neretva River from Stari Most . My guidebook said that for a small fee the local divers will give you a wetsuit and some lessons on how to safely dive off the bridge. I didn't see any brave/foolish tourists making the plunge today though.\nStari Most was built in the 16th century, is one of Bosnia and Herzegovina's most recognizable landmarks and is considered as one of the most significant pieces of Islamic architecture in the Balkans .\nDuring the Bosnian War, Mostar was a divided city between the eastern and western sides of the Neretva River.\nAfter receiving heavy damage throughout the war, the bridge was blown up by a tank on the 9th of November, 1993. A photo of the damaged bridge before it was completely destroyed.\nFollowing the war, there was significant effort and expense to reconstruct the bridge using stone from local quarries and recovered stones from the original bridge from the river below. The reconstructed bridge was inaugurated on the 23rd of July, 2004.\nIn the evening I went through the Old Town again, with thankfully the number of other tourists now thinned out.\nA couple taking a selfie on Stari Most .\nAfter the substantial breakfast and late lunch I just had an ice cream for dinner.\nAnd enjoyed the view of Stari Most at dusk at the end of day 2.\nDay 3.\nI got up early on the morning of day 3 and walked the 1.5 kilometres back to the bus station. Passing by some dogs helping themselves to breakfast at a dumpster.\nAnd arriving just before 6:30am for the 7am departure. This time I didn't have to pay a bus station fee but did have to pay \u20ac1 for my bag.\nJust a minibus today for the journey to Montenegro.\nThe route to Kotor. My ticket originally said a routing via Dubrovnik, but apparently it had been changed to bypass Croatia altogether today. It meant one less border crossing but an extra 3 hours of driving though.\nAt our first stop to stretch the legs after a couple of hours on the road.\nLooking down on the town of Trebinje just after 11am and where we had a 30 minute break.\nCrossing over at Ilino Brdo border and into Montenegro. The driver collected everyone's passport to be stamped out of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the again on the Montenegrin side.\nThere was luckily no queue on either side and we were on our way relatively quickly.\nAnother stop just after 2pm in the Montenegrin city of Nik\u0161i\u0107 .\nThe view of the rocky ridge of Ostro\u0161ka Greda as we make our way south.\nStopping again in the Podgorica , the Capital city of Montenegro.\nLooking across to Be\u010di\u0107i as the Adriatic finally comes into view.\nAnd just before 5pm and almost nine hours after leaving Mostar, we finally arrived in Kotor .\nThe daylight was quickly fading and I wanted to still do a bit of sightseeing, so after paying the \u20ac3 fee, I walked up through the Old Town and up the historic fortifications of Kotor .\nThe Old Town of Kotor and Kotor bay in the late afternoon.\nLooking up at the rocky and barren terrain of Pestingrad Peak.\nThe fortifications of Kotor consist of historic ramparts, towers, citadels, gates, bastions, forts, cisterns, a castle and other structures that were designed to protect the medieval town of Kotor.\nThe Azamara Quest in port.

Subscribe 24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter! Back to Article news How can you manage the money you are given monthly to help you through the month? It is an entirely different ball game at school. You live an independent life with little or no control because your parents are not there to keep their eyes on you. It is only the school authority that has limited control over you, which makes it possible for you to do anything without being questioned. ALSO READ: Money moves for single ladies in their 20's It also means you decide how you spend your money at school which means you are responsible for your own personal finances and financial decisions without your parent's intervention. So how can you manage your money while at school? Here are 5 ways you can manage your money at school 1. Create a budget Creating a budget is the most important part of managing your money and funds. With the monthly allowance given to you by your parent's, you should pen down your estimated expenses for the month. play Working with a budget helps you manage your funds better. (Pinterest) It might be difficult to have a regular and particular expense while at school but you could try to be sure what you know you spend money on. The important things to consider in your school budget are your school needs, your daily meal and your personal care items. The rest can come after all the important ones have been sorted. You can also remove the less important ones from your budget. Work and stick with your budget and also track your budget to improve on it each month. 2. Have a savings While you are at school, you should make saving a major priority when it comes to your personal finance. Cultivate the good money habit of saving while at school, it would definitely help you when you are out of school. Instead of having to depend on your parent's for all your needs, your savings would help you cover your personal wants. 3. Separate wants from needs What are wants and needs and how can you differentiate between the both? Your needs are more important than your wants. If you put your wants before your needs then you might have always be in bad financial situations. play Know the difference between your needs and wants. (Boostradio) Your needs are the expenses you can't do without and are very important at that exact period but your wants are the expenses you don't need but you desire to get.

Textbooks are one of the important things in schools which you can't do without and can be quite expensive. Instead of buying new textbooks, look for a place where old books are sold and buy your textbooks there, it would be far cheaper instead of buying new ones. 5. Find a job or create a side hustle If you know how to balance school stress and work stress, you can get a job while at school. If you can cope with such stress, you can create a side hustle for yourself while at school and do it at your own convenient time. play Find a job or create a side hustle while at school. (Laniletter) The good thing about getting a job or having a side hustle is not only the fact that you have extra cash which is added to your monthly allowance but you get to gain some work experience and entrepreneurial skills which would be useful when you are out of school. |", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [],

Either way, I want all New Zealanders to be able to access the really sound advice and assistance they need to make informed financial decisions. \n\"Consumers put a great deal of trust in the people and institutions that provide financial advice, and good financial advice can make a huge difference.\" \nMr Faafoi says both consumers and the industry have pointed out problems with the way financial advice is currently regulated. \n\"So this Bill strikes a balance between ensuring consumers can access quality advice, and not imposing undue compliance on the industry that could create unintended consequences that make advice less freely available. \nThe Bill will also improve disclosure to consumers. \"Currently, consumers are often left in the dark about commissions and other factors that may influence the advice they receive.\" Mr Faafoi says. \"We need that to change to ensure people are well informed at every stage of seeking or receiving advice.\" \nThe Bill will now be considered by the Economic Development, Science and Innovation Select Committee. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kris faaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faafoi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kiwis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "economic development, science and innovation select committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "financial services legislation amendment bill in parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:29.025+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10d42c39f0f8b5347e402ae06ab6f0f66e7ebd6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbW7c_3XSKYzNglBOQRUX_oRYKR535vgmJz9MkTipLllidJ.FMkPzzyyqRSyoYRoqOORfp63odpj08yyOHKHe67xRcdxHFjUrrcZJC0QTfrMxj8ZkqMTSjO6WV_1I2KFPwQ--", "site_full": "www.expedia.es", "site": "expedia.es", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.es/Goodwin-Hoteles.d3000343150.Guia-Viajes-Hoteles", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hoteles de Goodwin: compara hoteles en Goodwin y reserva con Expedia ", "title": "SureStay Hotel by Best Western Brinkley", "title_full": "SureStay Hotel by Best Western Brinkley (Forrest City, Estados Unidos) | Expedia.es", "published": "2017-09-22T08:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26131, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "658b155fb71d55d282c2f0e07acf762ae6d5a87f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbW7c_3XSKYzNglBOQRUX_oRYKR535vgmJz9MkTipLllidJ.FMkPzzyyqRSyoYRoqOORfp63odpj08yyOHKHe67xRcdxHFjUrrcZJC0QTfrMxj8ZkqMTSjO51KhMCZ6Hhew9d3hJTC1HG_qaxVx6nYB302fxrwYkIWqzxj5cvLeDy", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-28T04:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Staff was great.

To think that it would have turned out any different would be immature, naive and delusional. I work in the industry here in Washington. I work on a farm that can also process and we are not funded by deep pockets. While the company I work for is rapidly expanding, we have to do it solely on the profits of what we produce. Producer/processors can either whine about the big companies teaming up against the little guy, or they can be more efficient at management and planning while teaming up with other companies as that is the reality of how to survive in this business at present. Don't like it? Grow your own. For those who are inexperienced growers and lack discipline, it is much harder to grow the quality of pot you wanna be smoking than you realize. Also, I don't care how big or small your company is, when you are producing thousands of pounds a year, quality will be slightly less bc of the logistics and cost benefit analysis of processing to scale. Most people cannot even comprehend the amount of pot I handle every day, let alone the logistics of processing that amount efficiently before the next large amount comes in while making sure there is enough finished material ready to be sent to the lab for analysis so it can then be packaged. We have orders coming in faster than we can currently process and we process around 50 - 250+ pounds of finished product each week. Now keep in mind we are not a big company. Like the article stressed, there are no breaks for pot businesses. They were allowed to generate revenue for the states and you better believe that is exactly what the states are doing while imposing excessive regulations, fines, zoning complications, county/municipality specific regulations etc.\nIf you are not skilled labor, I encourage everyone not to work for this industry, at least in Washington, bc there are no benefits such as 401K or health insurance, overtime pay, holidays, paid vacations etc, at least not where I work and I work for a good company that starts workers off at higher than minimum wage. This is hard work and not the best for one's health, especially when breathing in pot dust all day long, even with a mask on.\nOh, and Budweiser just sucks, it's not about how much crappy beer they produce. They just make crappy beer. There are plenty of companies that can produce large amounts of their products that are consistently good. wildflowerbudd thanked you for this post wildflowerbudd liked this post", "highlightText":

On a more intermediate basis, cannabis research firm ArcView is looking for a compound annual growth rate of 26% through 2021 in North America, which would yield almost a $22 billion market by 2021. That rapid growth could be the ticket to substantial gains for investors willing to gamble on a substance that's still wholly illegal at the federal level in the United States.\nMarijuana businesses have an uphill climb in the U.S.\nBut that doesn't mean \"green\" businesses have a cakewalk to success. Nearly all marijuana-based businesses face a plethora of challenges that are a risk to their profits, and in some ways survival.\nFor example, in the U.S., most cannabis companies are unable to obtain basic financial services, ranging from something as simple as a checking account, to a line of credit or loan. The reason? Financial institutions report to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a federally created entity. And since marijuana is illegal at the federal level, providing financial services to a pot company could be construed as money laundering, leading to fines and/or criminal charges against a bank.\nIn addition, cannabis companies face disadvantages come tax time. Namely, U.S. tax code 280E disallows businesses that sell federally illegal substances from taking normal corporate income-tax deductions. Though not all pot businesses are profitable, if they are, they'll be required to pay tax on their gross profit instead of net profit, leaving less cash left over to reinvest and hire more workers.\nBeyond just financial challenges, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is trying to squash the industry before it expands further. There's arguably no one more opposed to cannabis in D.C. than Sessions. Back in May, Sessions sent a letter to a few of his Congressional colleagues requesting the repeal of the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment, which is what protects medical marijuana businesses in legal states from federal prosecution.\nNews flash: marijuana prices are plummeting in Colorado\nAt seemingly every turn, cannabis companies face challenges. Well, it's time to add yet another.\nAccording to a new analysis from The Economist, the wholesale price for a pound of cannabis in Colorado, the first state to begin legally selling recreational pot, has plunged from a peak of $2,000 in January 2015 to just $1,300 a pound today. Lower prices for dried cannabis are likely to mean lower margins, unless the cost per gram to produce marijuana has fallen by more than 35% over that same period.\nWhy the 35% drop in wholesale marijuana prices on a per-pound basis? The Economist attributes an expansion of supply and an increase in competition as a result of Sessions' mostly being all talk and no action. There's also some seasonality to this pricing, with peak pot prices observed during the ski season, when tourism picks up in the state.\nHowever, I'd contend that we're seeing something altogether different. My suspicion is that big businesses have been primarily responsible for weighing down pot prices in Colorado.\nFor those who may not recall, Colorado extended a moratorium on growing license issuances last year, which allowed those who'd already acquired a license to maintain control. This is especially true given that these grow licenses had no limits on the number of plants that could be cultivated on a grow farm. Additionally, nothing stopped big business from gobbling up as many licenses as they could afford in Colorado. The result is that just a few larger players wound up with a majority stake of the Colorado grow market.\nNow, if you're a big business and you want to eliminate your smaller competition, what do you do? Like Wal-Mart, you slash your prices to undercut the competition. Yes, this lowers margin, but you have deep pockets and your smaller competitors probably don't. Once you've sent them out of business or out of market, you've won the right to control more market share and command a higher price point for your product.\nThe way big business in Colorado is conquering smaller businesses is by flooding the market with dried cannabis. While this is a win for consumers in the short term, I suspect it's an anti-competitive tactic that'll substantially increase prices over the long run. While that'll be great for investors, it's not such good news for consumers.\nThis isn't just a concern in Colorado\nOf course, big business' takeover of the pot industry isn't just something we're seeing happen in Colorado. Canada, which has been a source of great success for the green rush and investors, looks to be dominated by just a handful of larger businesses.\nEven though Health Canada announced a change in policy this past May that would expedite the process by which growing licenses are issued and extended, it hasn't done much to stop just a handful of big players from taking over. Combined, Canopy Growth Corp., Aphria, Aurora Cannabis, and MedReleaf could wind up with about half of all recreational-weed market share if Canada's parliament moves forward with legalization this coming summer. This veritable green oligopoly should be able to command exceptional pricing power initially, and over the long term.\nIt also doesn't appear as if smaller businesses can stop these giants. Canopy Growth Corp. has been an active acquirer, gobbling up Mettrum Health earlier this year to boost its access to medical patients throughout Canada, as well as instantly expand its grow capacity.

Back to Article news The number of new UK businesses rose by 78% to 414,000 between 2010 and 2016 The impact of the Brexit vote upon entrepreneurial activity remains to be seen, but consumer spending has already dipped and business investment has slowed. \nLONDON \u2014 British entrepreneurs are forming an increasingly vital part of the economy with the number of new businesses rising by 78% to 414,000 between 2010 and 2016 according to the ONS, but the impact of the Brexit vote entrepreneurial activity remains to be seen. \nNew research commissioned by wealth manager Kleinwort Hambros by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr) found that the birth rate and survival rate \u2014 the number of businesses still in operation after one year \u2014 both improved dramatically between 2010 and 2016. \nnull (Kleinwort Hambros) \nIn particular, the research found that start-ups in professional, scientific, and technical businesses have the best survival rate of any sectors, with 95% of businesses founded in 2014 still in operation in 2015, the last year for which that data is available. \nPaul Bentley, head of entrepreneurs at Kleinwort Hambros, said entrepreneurial activity was driven by a more benign macroeconomic environment since the financial crash, although consumer spending in Britain has dipped in the wake of the Brexit vote . \n\"The financial crisis has given way to a more benign macroeconomic climate and an increase in consumer spending and business investment. We also saw interest rates cut to record lows which has decreased the cost of borrow helping to boost credit lines for the private sector,\" he said. \nBusiness investment has also slowed since the UK voted to leave the EU, but still rose by 0.2% in the second quarter of this year. \nThe data also found that London, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen were the locations where British businesses are most likely to succeed, based on a ranking which analysed start-up activity, economic conditions, business conditions and government support: \nnull (CEBR) \nThe north London borough of Islington came first on account of its highly educated workforce, while Edinburgh came second for its high score for government support. |", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "richard branson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "paul bentley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kleinwort hambros", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "virgin atlantic airways", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centre for economics and business research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kleinwort hambros", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cebr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cebr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:30.068+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45d7183c0c17f4805b881ce47b53e5a1c400240f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU47Wf.s068dqQuzVzFiibLa5lX7dpJKYSBAoOosj05FuPGwEWLKJ7QbnA5QP7VeEUUfbAc4MF8V9lvnP9KpvyGqXFd37PQgWclqW_Jr0piRsIw--", "site_full": "livresrecommende.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://livresrecommende.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Mes Livres", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T12:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45d7183c0c17f4805b881ce47b53e5a1c400240f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU47Wf.s068dqQuzVzFiibLa5lX7dpJKYSBAoOosj05FuPGwEWLKJ7QbnA5QP7VeEUUfbAc4MF8V9lvnP9KpvyGqXFd37PQgWclqW_Jr0piRsIw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brigitte HF (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\n\n\n\n\nOne Night Allie Everhart Publication date: December 4th 2017 Genres: New Adult, Romance \nI\u2019m a true romantic. I believe in fairy tales, soulmates, and happily ever afters. The last way I\u2019d ever try to find my true love is with a one night stand. But that night of the party, I wasn\u2019t looking for my soulmate. I just wanted to do something wild and crazy. So I did. \n\nWhen a hot guy with dark hair, brooding eyes, and a chiseled face made eye contact with me across a crowded room, I held his stare and waited for him to come over. Before even asking my name, he kissed me. I kissed him back. And then, without giving it a second thought, I followed him to a room and had my first ever one-night stand. \n\nThe next morning, I took off. It was only supposed to be one night. Nothing more. But I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him. Even months later, when I was dating someone else, I was still thinking about that mysterious stranger and the night we shared. Then I found out he\u2019s not a stranger. He\u2019s the friend of my roommate\u2019s boyfriend and has been looking for me all summer. \n\nI can\u2019t let him find me. We were never supposed to see each other again. I\u2019ll admit it was a magical night. One I\u2019ll never forget. There were sparks, fireworks, and this unexplained feeling that we belong together. But soulmates aren\u2019t found with a one-night stand. They\u2019re found with handwritten love notes. Flowers. A first kiss under the moonlight. \n\nA one night stand is the worst love story ever. But what if it\u2019s mine? \n\nGoodreads / Amazon    \nBarnes & Noble \niBooks / Kobo \n\n\n\nEXCERPT \nDYLAN \n\nI lean down and kiss her, and not a short goodbye kiss, but a real kiss. Slow and drawn out and expressing what I feel for her, which is more than I should feel for a girl after knowing her for such a short time and yet I still do. \n\nMy feelings for Amber are more than I\u2019ve felt for girls I\u2019ve dated for months. But why? Why do I feel this way? Was it the sex? Did that one night mess with my head, making me think I love this girl after knowing her for just a few hours? That can\u2019t be it. I\u2019ve had sex plenty of times and never felt this way. \n\nSomeone\u2019s car alarm goes off and I slowly back away. \n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to do that,\u201d Amber says in a soft, breathy voice. \n\n\u201cYou said I could if we\u2019re in public.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cNo changing the rules now. If we\u2019re in public, I can kiss you. That\u2019s what you said.\u201d \n\n\u201cFine, but it doesn\u2019t matter because we\u2019re not going out like this again. We\u2019re going back to the letters. You said you\u2019d try it so that\u2019s we\u2019re going to do. No texts. No emails. Just letters. You broke the rules today by coming here but we\u2019re going to get this back on track.\u201d \n\nI just smile at her, then wrap my hand around hers and lead her inside the apartment building. We go up the elevator and when we\u2019re at her door, I say, \u201cI didn\u2019t break the rules.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d \n\n\u201cBy showing up here, I didn\u2019t break the rules of our arrangement.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes you did. You were supposed to just write letters.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd do romantic gestures. That\u2019s what you said. And today was a romantic gesture. I showed up at your apartment unannounced. I surprised you. Surprises are romantic gestures.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh.\u201d She looks perplexed. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not really what I meant.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t define romantic gestures. They\u2019re different for everyone. And to me, surprising you like this was a romantic gesture, as was buying you your favorite muffin.\u201d \n\n\u201cDid you look up the definition of gesture? Because you seem to know a lot about them.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot really. I\u2019m kind of learning as I go. This is all new to me. I\u2019ve never had all these dating rules before.\u201d \n\n\u201cI know it seems strange but I warned you I was a little crazy when it comes to romance. And given the way we met, I just feel like we need to step back and start again. I don\u2019t want us to just be about sex. I want more.\u201d \n\n\u201cSo do I.\u201d I kiss her cheek. \u201cI have to go. I\u2019ll call you\u2014I mean, I look forward to your next letter.\u201d \n\nShe smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll put extra time into it.\u201d \n\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d I say, walking to the elevator, \u201cbecause if it\u2019s like the last one, I\u2019ll fall asleep before I even finish reading it.\u201d \n\nThe stunned look on her face is the last thing I see before stepping into the elevator. It\u2019s fun giving her shit about that letter. She knows it was crap and I could tell she was embarrassed by it. I can\u2019t wait to see what she writes me next to make up for it. \n\n\n\nAuthor Bio \nAllie Everhart writes romance and romantic suspense and is the author of the popular Jade Series, Kensington Series, Wheeler Brothers, and several standalone titles.

Shikamaru then had everyone clear out to begin clean-up. Two weeks later, Sumire tried to settle things down when Inojin Yamanaka began speaking out. When her class watches Boruto fight Iwabee Yuino , Sumire noted that Boruto really seems to be striving to make a name for himself outside his relationship to the Seventh Hokage. The following day, Sumire is relieved to see Boruto getting along better with everyone. Ch\u014dch\u014d Akimichi teases Sumire about her concern for Boruto, to which an embarrassed Sumire insists it is purely from her status as class rep. \nWeeks later, as class started learning shurikenjutsu, Sumire was upset that her own performance wasn't showing much progress. Eventually, Boruto's reckless fun caused some property damage. Shino Aburame decided to have Boruto, along with a bunch of other students help with repairs to the Hokage Rock , although he insisted that Sumire's part would mainly be supervision. When the boys and girls of their class got into an argument, Shino assisted that they settle things with a race to capture the flag on top of the Academy. Despite their victory, the girls made peace with the boys. Later, Sumire realises that she is being stalked. Eventually, she and her friends discover that it is Magire . When Magire meekly asks her out, Sumire turned him down. The following day, to Sumire's horror, various creepy messages are left for her. Eventually, she is confronted by Magire, who kidnaps her. When her friends found them, Ch\u014dch\u014d was able to reach Magire, noting that such an indecisive nature will never win anyone over. Accepting his poor methods of trying to make Sumire like him, the spectre was rejected from Magire. Sumire injured following her orchestrated attack. \nThe class was later assigned by Shino to split into groups of three and each tail a different workplace for a few days to better understand non-shinobi life. Sumire suggested her group go to the Water Purification Plant. On the second day, Sumire unleashed the Nue on the feigning being a victim. She was ultimately \"saved\" by the Hokage, who took Sumire and her fellow injured classmates to the hospital. Her friends and teacher soon afterwards went to check on her. Later, Sumire watched solemnly as her injured classmates were relieved from care early and left with their respective parents. \nSoon after realising that her identity was found out, Sumire left the hospital, having feigned injuries, and decided to complete her mission. She was ultimately ambushed by Sai Yamanaka and his team. While initially subdue, she summoned the Nue to rampage the village. As she slipped away, she was confronted by Mitsuki, who noted his mission to kill her. As the two began fighting, Boruto arrived, demanding answers. Sumire bluntly stated that her entire existence has always been for revenge. As Boruto intervened in another clash between his two friends, his eye began to act wildly. Nue then teleported above the children. Sumire calmly offered herself as the necessary chakra to complete its development, which the creature grabbed her. Boruto and Mitsuki followed her into Nue's pocket dimension . Together, they were able to subdue the beast. Before Mitsuki could destroy it, Sumire appeared to defend it. Boruto stepped in, insisting her identity as Class Rep was the real her. Torn between all she knew, Sumire ordered the Nue to take her chakra and finish her father's plan, only for Nue to instead affectionately snuggle against her. Boruto noted that as Sumire basically raised Nue, it has come to view her as a parent. Sumire being taken away by Sai. \nAs Boruto continued insisting that she can forge her own path void of anger, Sumire was finally able to let go of her own anger, weakening the Gozu Tenn\u014d. This caused the dimension to begin crumbling around them. As Sumire resigned to accept demise as penance, she finally remembered her mother's voice and sincere desire for her happiness. This, along with Boruto coming to her aid, convinced her to come back. Nue then helped the three students escape the dimension, being left behind from falling debris. Back in the normal dimension, Sai and his unit arrived. Sympathising with Sumire's past, he offered to help her rebuild her life, which Sumire accepted as she turned herself in. Before leaving, Boruto noticed that piece of Nue's essence remained with Sumire on her left palm, much to her delight. [1] \nDue to Sumire turning herself in and there being no casualties, Sumire was given leniency. However, while determining her future, she was held in a detention cell. Soon afterwards, she was visited by Shino. Unable to look her teacher in the eye after what she did to him, Shino insisted that he held no ill feelings towards her, and actually was grateful as it helped him grow as a teacher. Shino offered to help her in any way to rebuild her life, insisting that she is no longer an instrument of her father's. Ultimately, Sumire was pardoned for her actions and allowed to return to the Academy. Her class was overjoyed to see her return, which gave Sumire mixed feelings. Upon seeing Boruto give her a silent approval, Sumire cried in joy, happy to return to the life of happiness at the Academy. [6] School Trip Arc Edit \nTo improve relationships with other villages and symbolically show the warring era was over, the Seventh Hokage set up an official class trip for the Academy to go to Kirigakure. Upon arriving, they were met with Kagura Karatachi , who was appointed by the Mizukage to act as the class' tour guide. The class was later taken to meet Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d , the Sixth Mizukage, who welcomed the class to the village. Later, the class was confronted by a group of delinquents, with their leader Tsurushi Hachiya , openly expressed their dislike of outsiders. After Kagura stepped into in an attempt to stop the fight, his hand was cut, which Sumire soon after tended to. When their field trip was finished, Sumire and her classmates departed Kiri by cruise ship. Graduation Arc Edit \nAs graduation exams began to draw near, Boruto, fearing that his friends were drifting apart, invited everyone on a camping trip to catch a famed Eternal Carp. During the trip, Sumire voiced her joy as having made such wonderful friends. Upon finally ensnaring one of the massive fishes, Sumire summoned the Nue to help, showing that the creature had begun to regain its previous form and power. The miniaturised Nue used its chakra to strengthen Boruto's fishing pole and successfully capture the fish. The friends soon afterwards cooked and at the fish to their delight. Sumire and Sarada facing Konohamaru. \nDuring the exams, taking up Shino's subtle offer to try stealing the test answers for the written test, Sumire and her friends were able to easily pass the test. Later, during the practical and final test, the class was brought to the training field. There, the entire class was set up to face Shino, Anko Mitarashi and Konohamaru for 24 hours. While the teachers would still evaluate the students' respective improvements, the students' true test was against Kakashi Hatake. The Sixth Hokage quickly explained that he would only pass the first student who is able to take the single bell attached to his hip. As the test began, Sumire and some of her friends faced off against Konohamaru. As the j\u014dnin easily dispatched several of the students, Sumire and Sarada chose to fend off Konohamaru while Mitsuki and Boruto went on, realising that the true goal was not simply to get Kakashi's bell. Sumire then summoned the Nue to fight Konohamaru, but he quickly repelled the creature with his Lightning Release . \nUltimately, Konohamaru captured Sarada in the process. Sumire then regroup with the remaining students. Taking to heart Kakashi's harsh scolding on him, Boruto voiced his dismay at \"failing\" everyone, having led them to becoming lazy and weak-minded as a ninja. Sumire and everyone insisted however that his influence as only made them strong, helping them grow pass their previous problems. The inspired Boruto then designed a plan to pass the test. First, he instructed everyone on how to save the captured students. Sumire's part was to have Nue stealthily free them while the teachers were distracted. Afterwards, Sumire helped in defeating Anko. With Kakashi as the only obstacles left, Sumire and the others faced him. Despite their group assault, Kakashi easily repelled all the students. This however proved to be a setup to get the Sixth Hokage in a group String Light Formation . Despite their effort, Kakashi was still able to hold them off. Ultimately, time ran out with no one getting the bell. However, Kakashi still chose to pass everyone as they succeeded in the test's true goal; team-work and loyalty. Ao Arc Edit \nBy the time Sumire was eligible to enter the Ch\u016bnin Exams , she instead chose to begin working at Scientific Ninja Weapons Team, where she soon became one of their top workers. One day when Katasuke T\u014dno was returning to the lab from a field test, Sumire was surprised to find him being guarded by her former classmates in Team Konohamaru . As she served tea and began to catch up with them, she voiced both her joy at her job and working alongside Katasuke. She then watched as Boruto and his team aided in the testing of new ninja tech.

Subscribe 24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter! Back to Article news Philip Hammond called \"ignorant\" after suggesting low productivity rates were because of more disabled people working. The chancellor told the Treasury Select Committee that more disabled people working \"may have had an impact\" on productivity. Labour MP John Mann says the remarks are \"appalling.\" \nLONDON \u2014 Philip Hammond has been criticised after linking low productivity rates to higher amounts of disabled people working in the UK. \nThe chancellor told MPs at the Treasury Select Committee that \"very high levels of engagement in the workforce\" of disabled people \"may have had an impact on overall productivity measurements.\" \nLabour MP John Mann, a member of the committee, said the remarks were \"appalling\" and \"ignorant\" in a tweet. \nAnna Bird, director of policy and research at disability charity Scope, told HuffPost : \u201cThese comments are totally unacceptable and derogatory. \nAsked about a fall in productivity rates in 2017, Hammond replied that: \"The consequences of high levels of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, will be felt for many, many years to come. \n\"It is almost certainly the case that by increasing participation in the workforce, including far higher levels of participation by marginal groups and very high levels of engagement in the workforce, for example of disabled people - something we should be extremely proud of - may have had an impact on overall productivity measurements.\" \nMann tweeted: \"Appalling. Chancellor just linked low productivity growth to the labour market and specified the increased employment of disabled people. \n\"My experience of employing disabled people is that they are brilliant employees. The chancellor\u2019s comments are ignorant.\" \nBird said the remarks \"fundamentally undermine the Government\u2019s policy to get more disabled people into work, and the ambition set out by the Prime Minister just a week ago. The Chancellor must urgently withdraw them and offer a full apology.\" \nLabour productivity measured by output per hour fell 0.1% between March and June, according to ONS figures . The fall came despite more people being in work and working more hours. \nThe government aims to get one million more disabled people into work over the course of a 10-year plan, halving the difference between employment rates for disabled and non-disabled people, which stood at 32% in 2016. \nLabour's shadow disabilities minister Marsha de Cordova tweeted that it was \"shocking that Philip Hammond is trying to blame disabled people for low productivity! \n\"Disabled people contribute enormously and disability employment gap has barely changed since productivity started to stall.

Ajak, then a member of the Mad Cowz street gang, was one of three gang members or associates charged in the killing.\nMan convicted in Johnny G's shooting to serve 12 years Justice Vic Toews said there was no direct, reliable evidence tying Ajak to Moar's murder.\n\"While I am convinced that it is likely that Mr. Ajak was involved in some fashion in assisting Mad Cow gang members or associates in carrying out the murder of Mr. Moar, that is not the test,\" Toews said.\n\"The certainty which the law requires is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, rather than the likelihood of his involvement in this murder. I am not convinced of Mr. Ajak's guilt to a certainty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\nDylan Chatkana, now 20, was found guilty last year of shooting Moar and was sentenced as an adult to life in prison with no chance of parole for seven years.

Chatkana, his face concealed behind a bandana, armed himself with a sawed-off rifle, walked into the restaurant and opened fire as Moar walked out of the restroom.\nProsecutors alleged it was Ajak who borrowed the van that was used to follow Moar. They argued cellphone tower records associated with a phone seized from Ajak at the time of his arrest showed he was in the vicinity of the Opera nightclub and Johnny G's before, during and immediately after the killing.\n\"However, it is also in evidence that this phone was used by other members of the gang in the context of making drug deals or for other gang-related puposes,\" Toews said.\n\"In considering all of the evidence, I am not satisfied that at the time of the murder this phone was in the possession of Mr. Ajak or that \u2026 Mr. Ajak was in the vehicle from which Mr.

are all from the cities like Esfahan, Shiraz, Ahwaz, Tabeiz, Rasht, Mashhad, and all of them are residing in the Califorina, specially in the LA , San Diego and Orange County.\r\nWe ( people originally from Tehran) call them SHAHRESTANI, it means the people who are not originally from Tehran.\r\nThey are so many SHAHRESTANI who are living in Tehran, after the revolution on 1978, but it doesn't mean they are Tehranian, however they all say: we are Tehranian! But they are not, and Tehranian people hate them. Yes, the reality is that the Tehranian people hate SHAHRESTANI people, because they are RUDE, LIAR,they STINK(their breath smells poop, because they are from poor cultured families and uneducated families, with a zoo level of personal hygiene ), JEALEOUS and they always have the envy of being Tehranian, so when you ask these RUDE and really LOWCLASS iranian(Persian)s that where are they from? 100% they will reply you : I'm from Tehran! While they are not\r\nThey have some significant:\r\n1. rude\r\n2. Liar\r\n3. Jealous\r\n4. Thick and disgusting Accent\r\n5. They always pretend to class and attitude\r\n6. All like Mercedes Benz!\r\n7. Females put on heavy make up, withe blond hair ( which is not their real hair color , they dye it to blond or BLACK BLACK, cause they think they look like SEXY!)\r\n7. Long heel shoes!\r\n8. Short skirts!\r\n9. Acting and dressing like clowns or sluts\r\n10. Mostly going to UCLA or UCSD( you can see bunch of these digesting SHAHRESTANI males and females in there)\r\n11. They all likes the brands like Chanel and Gucci, and they bring so many fake Gucci and Chanel accessories from iran( Persia) and they will say you, these are all original brands!\r\nAnd yes, these bad smell SHAHRESTANI people, always say:\r\nIran( Persia) is better than the USA !

In the anime, before joining the Academy , he watched a class from afar, silently observing when a strange summoning went on a rampage before being subdued. Later, when an expelled student of the Academy was causing damage to the village (being possessed a spectre) Mitsuki intervened and quickly stopped him. In doing so, he met Boruto, Shikadai Nara , and Iwabee Yuino . The following day, he was introduced at the Academy as a new transfer student. Taking an interest in Boruto, Mitsuki decided sit next to him. During combat training, Mitsuki quickly showed himself to be very advanced, easily defeating Iwabee, but also trying to kill him. He was ultimately stopped by Boruto, who voiced his disdain at such actions, prompting Mitsuki to apologise. Later that night, Mitsuki was in contact with someone through a white snake. \nThe following day, Shino Aburame decided to use homeroom to have a welcoming party for Mitsuki. When Shino's efforts for the party backfired with his insects, the class began to freak out, with Denki begging someone to make the insects go away, to which Mitsuki did with his Wind Release: Breakthrough , causing even more damage to the Academy. Afterwards, one of the repairmen went berserk, causing even more damage to the Academy. Mitsuki realised that the man had the same dark aura about him as the expelled student from earlier, impressed that Boruto was also able to see as well. Working alongside his new classmates, they were able to subdue the man. The following day, Mitsuki, along with Boruto and Shikadai were called to the training fields for an extracurricular lesson from Shino. When their teacher appeared, he was under the same possession as the others. Shino then encased the entire area with his insects, forcing the students to flee. After a prolonged chase, Shikadai devised a plan to stop the rampaging sensei. While Shikadai and Boruto distracted Shino and lured him into the water, Mitsuki ensnared Shino and electrocuted him, expelling the spectre. This act stopped Shino's rampage, but left Mitsuki exhausted and began sinking to the bottom of the lake. He was saved by the then recovered Shino. This ultimately made him acknowledge Shino's worth as a teacher. \nLater, while walking talking with Boruto and Shikadai about the recent attacks, they found some of the girls subduing a boy. They learned that the boy, Magire , was a student from the Academy and had a crush on Sumire. When his feelings were rejected by Sumire, he ran away. The following day, notes were being left all over the Academy for Sumire. Eventually, it was revealed to be done by Magire, who was being possessed the by the spectre and ultimately kidnapped Sumire. Mitsuki watched as Boruto and Shikadai battled Magire. Ultimately, it was Ch\u014dch\u014d that was able to reason with Magire, helping him to calm down and reject the spectre. Afterwards, Magire collapsed from having most of his chakra drained by the spectre. Later that night, Mitsuki again reported to an unknown person through his white snake, saying he would continue his investigation as to why only Boruto can see this spectre. Eventually, Boruto came to the conclusion that his special eye power was the Byakugan . However, after Boruto tested the theory with his grandfather , Boruto learned that to not be the case. Despite this, Boruto was still determined to figure out the true nature of his eye, surprising Mitsuki with his mature attitude. \nDetermined to find and capture the spectre, which Mitsuki liked Boruto's name of \"Ghost\", they and Shikadai decided to resort to skipping classes with a faked excuse. Due to Mitsuki's poor written excuse, they were quickly found out. It was decided that the three as punishment would have to take after-school classes to make up the lost time. Later, Shino assigned his class to tail other workplaces to better understand non-shinobi life. Seeing Boruto's desire to continue patrolling the village, he subtly convinced Boruto, Shikadai, and Mitsuki to try the postal service. While sorting stamps, they heard on the news that another attack happened at the water purification plant, where Sumire was. Mitsuki and his friends quickly rushed to her aid. \nAfter making sure the Sumire was okay, Mitsuki and his friends were approached by Naruto. Realising that they were investigating the attacks as well, he showed them what became of the culprit's victims; near-complete chakra depletion that required intensive care. While telling the children to stay away from the matter, Shino appeared, insisting that they trust in his student' effort, which Naruto ultimately agreed to. It was then decided to get extra help from their classmates, realising that Mitsuki's team was being spied on. After everyone was given their area to cover and left the post office, the mysterious culprit controlling the spectre unleashed it on the post chief. However, Mitsuki's group anticipated this action, corning the culprit. As the ninja retreated and slipped away from everyone else, Mitsuki soon found him. After a stare-off, Mitsuki withdraw his pursuit, letting the culprit escape. After returning to his group, Mitsuki helped in cleaning up the post office. \nAs classes continued, Mitsuki continued to show noticeable interest in Boruto, he began asking his various classmates their views on him, intrigued by their various two-sided answers of finding him troublesome but fun. Ultimately, he asked Boruto if he can join him for dinner at his house, which he agreed to. On that night, Naruto surprisingly was able to join them for dinner. However, as dinner began, Naruto learned that a strange chakra was being dispersed throughout the village, prompting him to leave. Boruto was furious at this, seeing his father leave at the slightest notices. Seeing Naruto's duties as Hokage as someone who would sacrifice those closest to him for the sake of the entire village, he was determined to stop the spectre before Naruto to prove his father wrong on his methods. Mitsuki than revealed he knew who the culprit was. \nHe declared it to be Sumire. Boruto rebuffed such an accusation, but Mitsuki insisted it was true after having done his own research. Suddenly, there was a large earthquake in the village, followed by the emergence of the spectre, now in a tangible form. Mitsuki was contacted again through his snake, given the order to kill the Sumire. Mitsuki told Boruto that they can stop the creature if they kill the summoner. Boruto refused to kill his friend, prompting Mitsuki to restrain him with a snake clone. Mitsuki found Sumire and attacked her, who was able to fend off his initial attack. As Mitsuki managed to pin her and prepared for the kill, Boruto arrived, distracting Mitsuki enough for Sumire to escape. Sumire proclaimed that the girl they knew never existed. Boruto continued to get between Mitsuki's attacks. Suddenly, Boruto's right eye began reacting randomly, causing the Nue to teleport above them. Sumire calmly offered herself to the creature to complete its development. While she was swallowed whole and dragged into a space-time portal, Boruto quickly jumped in after her. \nIn the pocket dimension , Mitsuki aids Boruto in fending off Nue. As Boruto managed to restrain it, Mitsuki prepared to kill Nue. His effort was blocked by Sumire. As Mitsuki again battled Sumire, Boruto took a kunai blow from her to halt the fight. Boruto insisted that vengeance doesn't have to be her path. Rattled and torn between all she knew as Boruto continued to befriend her, Sumire told Nue to take her chakra and finish the plan, only for the creature to snuggle against her. Boruto surmised that having been the one who raised Nue, it came to view Sumire as its parent. Boruto insisted that Sumire doesn't want violence and knows she doesn't want the beast to follow the same dark path that was forced on her. Letting go of her anger, it broke the summoning contract on her back, causing the dimension to start crumbling. Boruto reached Sumire and convinced her to join him, leaving Mitsuki amazed at Boruto again finding an answer that defied logic. Boruto found the portal back home. Upon arriving, they were found by their friends and elite ninja. Sai , who could sympathise with Sumire's past, offered to help her build a new path for her. Sumire willingly turned herself in. \nSeveral weeks later, Shino decided to change up the three-man teams for their next challenge to determine the optimum pairings for graduation. Mitsuki insisted on staying on Boruto's team and also teamed-up with Lee. During their challenge to capture a flag, Mitsuki cut on of the construction beams to stop his opponents, allowing Boruto to get the flag. Shino was then called aside concerning Sumire. As the class began discussing rumours that Sumire was being transferred to a different school, they were relieved to see her return to their class. Sarada Uchiha Arc Edit \nMain article: Naruto Gaiden: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring Upon hearing that he and the rest of the class will be going through graduation exams in a week, Mitsuki eagerly said to Boruto that the day has finally arrived, to which Boruto agreed, claiming it would be a piece of cake. He later ran into Ch\u014dch\u014d Akimichi and Sarada at a restaurant and had a little chat with the girls, noting that questioning their identity and self-worth is common for girls their age and is commonly referred to as their \"tragic heroine syndrome\". Mitsuki was also able to determine from which clan Ch\u014dch\u014d hails, not only from seeing her family crest but based on her appearance as well. \nLater, Mitsuki joined Boruto in a simple errand of deliver lunch to the Hokage from his wife for the trip. After arriving too late, Sarada and Ch\u014dch\u014d offered to leave the village and bring it to him. While Boruto felt it pointless, he soon saw the strong desire in Sarada's eyes. Mitsuki, also realising this was important to the young Uchiha, asked Ch\u014dch\u014d to give them a minute, who wondered if this was a love confession from the boy. Mitsuki simply replied that her symptoms were getting worse and that she needed professional help. School Trip Arc Edit \nIn the anime, to improve relationships with other villages and symbolically show the warring era was over, the Seventh Hokage set up an official class trip for the Academy to go to Kirigakure. Upon arriving, they were met with Kagura Karatachi , who was appointed by the Mizukage to act as the class' tour guide. The class was later taken to meet Ch\u014dj\u016br\u014d , the Sixth Mizukage, who welcomed the class to the village. \nWhen Denki was captured by a group of delinquents who admired the \"Bloody Mist Village\" era, Mitsuki joined in the rescue. The leader of the group was to be Tsurushi Hachiya , and old classmate of Kagura. As they began mocking Kagura's relationship with the Konoha-nin, they attacked the visiting class. During the fight, Hachiya revealed Kagura's dark past as the grandson of the Fourth Mizukage and having his own personal bloodshed reputation from his Academy days. After defeating their enemies, to cheer up Kagura, they inviting him to play a card game with them. The next day, Mitsuki followed Suigetsu through Kirigakure, barely missing him by the shinobi swords' vault. \nLater, after Shizuma and team stole the Seven Mist Swordsmen's swords, Suigetsu met up with Mitsuki, telling him that he was given orders by Orochimaru to not get involved. Mitsuki however smugly stated that Orochimaru knows well that he does as he feels. Suigetsu quickly realised that they were being watched by Inojin and Shikadai, catching them by surprise. As the two were convinced to help, Suigetsu gave Mitsuki a scroll to help in the matter. Mitsuki fighting Shizuma. \nMitsuki arrived as a reluctant Kagura battled Boruto. Mitsuki scoffed at Shizuma's claims of a village void of lies and secrets when he was guilty of such. He revealed that Suigetsu's scroll had information and proof of Shizuma and his followers not only conspiring with the Land of Waves, but also killing various people in Kirigakure who learned of his plans and refused to help him. When Shizuma took the allegations in stride, proud of his actions, he decided to finish the battle personally when Kagura refused to fight. He unleashed a blood mist that enabled him to absorb enemy's s chakra through their open wounds. While Shizuma's superior skill proved too much for them individually, Mitsuki and Boruto's coordinated tag-team enabled them to over-power the foe. Refusing to accept defeat, Shizuma reclaimed Samehada, backfiring on him as his inexperience allowed Samehada to overwhelm him into a feral state. Boruto and Kagura together were ultimately able to defeat the foe, ending the rebellion. The Konoha-nin then quickly ran back to their hotel to make curfew. \nLater, after returning to Konohagakure, Mitsuki helped a distraught Boruto find a suitable replacement gift to make up for not remembering to get a Kirigakure souvenir for Himawari . Despite succeeding in his cover-up plan, a letter from Kagura, in which he apologised for his actions, convinced Boruto to both give his gift and confess his mistake to his little sister. Graduation Arc Edit \nAs ninja classes began preparing for the graduation exams, the various students were interviewed about their future goals alongside a parent. This also included Mitsuki being joined by Orochimaru, who discreetly snuck in to the village to not cause a commotion while talking to the Seventh Hokage. After the interview, Mitsuki talked with Orochimaru about his decision to stay in Konohagakure as a Konoha-nin so he could continue learning new things from being around Boruto, which Orochimaru accepted. Mitsuki subdues Shino. \nDuring the exams, taking up Shino's subtle offer to try stealing the test answers for the written test, Mitsuki and his friends were able to easily pass the test. Later, during the practical and final test, the class was brought to the training field. There, the entire class was set up to face Shino, Anko Mitarashi and Konohamaru for 24 hours. While the teachers would still evaluate the students' respective improvements, the students' true test was against Kakashi Hatake. The Sixth Hokage quickly explained that he would only pass the first student who is able to take the single bell attached to his hip. As the test began, Mitsuki chose to aid Boruto in getting past Shino so his friend could pursue Kakashi. Ultimately, Mitsuki was able to eliminate Shino by destroying his marker. \nMitsuki then aided Iwabee in rescuing Boruto from the clutches of Kakashi, though the latter was hurt in the scuffle. As Boruto's injuries were treated, deeply affected by Kakashi's hard words, Boruto apologised to his friends for \"failing\" them by dragging their performance down with his lazy attitude. However, Mitsuki and all the others insisted that it was because of Boruto that they overcame so many of their problems. Inspired by Iwabee and the other students' praise, Boruto realised the truth behind the teaches' deceptions. He then conceived a series of plans to pass the test, which the friends all backed up. Together, they were able to eliminate the other teachers save the students that were captured, the latter of which in turn helped back Boruto's play against Kakashi. They all attacked Kakashi while disguised as Boruto, but the Sixth Hokage easily blocked their assault. This however was a setup, allowing the team to catch Kakashi in a Multiple String Light Formation . While pinning down Kakashi somewhat, he quickly repelled them with his Lightning Release. Ultimately, time ran out. However, despite no one getting the bell, Kakashi passed all the students as they succeeded at the test's true goal; loyalty and team-work. Versus Momoshiki Arc Edit \nMain article: Boruto: Naruto the Movie After graduating from the Academy and becoming a genin, Mitsuki is assigned to Team Konohamaru with Boruto and Sarada. Mitsuki and his team are sent on a mission to capture a giant panda. As Boruto used his shadow clones to subdue the panda bear and Sarada was irritated at him for his disregard for teamwork, Mitsuki told her to leave it all to Boruto because he is the Hokage's son and is likely to become Hokage one day, much to Sarada's chagrin due to her declaration she will become Hokage. After the mission, they reported to the Hokage's office where Boruto and his father got into an argument. Boruto warns him not to miss his sister 's birthday otherwise he would never forgive him before storming out. Mitsuki and Sarada met up with Boruto later on to inform him that the Ch\u016bnin Exams are starting soon, although Boruto declares that he has no interest in taking part in them which causes an argument between Boruto and Sarada. When Boruto asks Sarada if her father will come to watch the Exams, she replies by saying that she doubts it and after briefly discussing Sarada's father, Mitsuki says that he was told by his parent that Sasuke is the only one who is able to fight equally with Naruto. This leaves Boruto and Sarada curious about his parentage. However before Mitsuki can tell his teammates who his parent is, Hinata and Himawari arrive to pick Boruto up for Himawari's birthday party. \nMitsuki enters in the Ch\u016bnin Exams with his teammates, although it takes some scolding from Sarada and meeting Sasuke to get Boruto to agree to enter with him and Sarada. The first round of the Ch\u016bnin Exams is a true or false quiz regarding a question about the fifth volume of a novel series. When it is revealed that both answers are incorrect, each team is unexpectedly dropped into a pit with a lake of ink at the bottom. Mitsuki stretches his limbs to keep himself and his teammates from falling into the ink and Sarada deduces the quiz was a sham all along and that anyone who falls into the ink is disqualified. Having successfully avoided falling into the ink, Mitsuki and his team progress to the second round where the teams compete for flags. Mistuki and Sarada go off to try and steal other teams' flags while Boruto stays behind to defend theirs. When Boruto is attacked by another genin team, Mitsuki decides to go back to help him. However, by the the time arrives, Boruto had already defeated the other genin (with the use of his Kote ). They are ultimately successful in acquiring other flags as well as protecting their own. When they regroup, Sarada scolds Boruto for not being happier that they passed before commenting that his eyes are even bluer than Naruto's, to which Mitsuki agrees after unexpectedly getting up in Boruto's face and giving him a fright. Mitsuki wins his match against Toroi in the Ch\u016bnin Exams. \nIn the third round, Mitsuki was able to beat Toroi . Before his upcoming match against Araya , he and Sarada watch Boruto's fight against Shikadai Nara and was disappointed when he was disqualified for cheating. Soon afterwards, Momoshiki and Kinshiki \u014ctsutsuki attack. Mitsuki and Sarada help evacuate children from the area. He became concerned for Sarada when it appeared that she had been crushed by falling debris, but was then shown to be relieved when he saw that she had been saved by her father. After Momoshiki and Kinshiki left, Mitsuki tried to comfort Boruto when he found out that Naruto had sacrificed himself. When Boruto, Sasuke and the other four Kage prepared to travel to another dimension to rescue Naruto, Mitsuki accompanied Sarada, Sakura and a worried Hinata so that she could stop Boruto from going on such a dangerous mission. However, Hinata ultimately agreed to let Boruto go after seeing his determination and how much he resembled his father when he was younger. Before leaving, Boruto asked Mitsuki and Sarada to take care of the village while he was gone. \nAfter the ordeal, Mitsuki joined his teammates on a mission to catch a giant panda that was running loose within the village. The three of them have a brief conversation in which Boruto states that he wants to be a shinobi like Sasuke, before they jump from the Hokage Rock and into the air and shortly complete their mission. Mujina Bandits Arc Edit Mitsuki and Sarada subdue Shojoji. \nWhile Team Konohamaru is on a mission to capture the Mujina Bandits , Mitsuki ends up capturing and tying up one of the bandits to a tree. A few days later, Mitsuki's team was surprised to be presented with their first B-rank mission. While Sarada and Boruto were intimidated at first, Mitsuki noted that the Fifth Kazekage was known for doing B-rank missions while a genin himself, quickly exciting his team-mates. On the day of the mission, when Boruto abandoned the mission for personal reasons, Sarada had Mitsuki track their teammate down to help. They arrived into time to save the paralysed Boruto from Shojoji , quickly subduing and defeating the bandit. Later, while applauded for saving Tent\u014d and capturing the Mujin Bandits, Konohamaru also said they would have to be punished for abandoning their official mission. Ao Arc Edit \nSometime after the capture of Shojoji , Naruto joined his son in a sparring match in front of the Academy students and other spectators. While Boruto showed considerable improvement in his techniques, Naruto was somehow able to nullify them all. Mitsuki determined that Naruto was actually absorbing the techniques. After the match, with which Naruto won, it was revealed that Naruto was testing a new advanced ninja tool based off of Momoshiki's absorption power. While Boruto was furious at the deception, Sasuke calmed Boruto down, noting that this was necessary as the danger to their world was still very imminent. \nAs Sasuke explained the existence of an organisation who threat level was comparable to the \u014ctsutsuki Clan , Mitsuki asked if this group had anything to do with the mark Boruto gained from Momoshiki. While Boruto was furious at Mitsuki offhandedly revealing his secret. Naruto however admitted that Sasuke already told them about it, which was another reason Naruto approved the development of this advanced weaponry. Katasuke then arrived to retrieve his prototype, to which Naruto assigned Team Konohamaru a C-rank mission to escort the lead scientist back to the lab in Ry\u016bben City. While Boruto stormed off in a huff, Naruto asked his genin team-mates to watch over him should anything happen with his mark. Mitsuki then talked to Boruto, convincing him to get over his anger and join the mission. Once arriving on a train to their destination, they bumped into an old patient of Katasuke, Ao , a survivor of the Ten-Tails 's attack from the Fourth Great Shinobi War. \nUpon arriving at the lab, Mitsuki and his team were surprised to see Sumire, who was working there. For the second part of their mission, Team Konohamaru aided in the testing of new technology. Soon afterwards, they receive a call from the Seventh Hokage, noting that Konohamaru and his partner Mugino went missing during a mission nearby. Naruto then reassigned Team Konohamaru to search for their J\u014dnin sensei.

I think I came up with a brilliant idea for her! It is very simple, but does require a bit of forward planning. And it\u2019s something that anyone can do \ud83d\ude42 \nMy son loves drawing. He is very proud of his drawings, and usually scans a copy to give to his grandmother. She has pictures from all the grandchildren stuck up all around the house! So I decided to come up with something using his drawings, that would also be useful. And she often writes and posts cards and letters, so that\u2019s what I made. \nTogether, my son and I chose some of his pictures that would be suitable to go on cards. \nI had to iron some, as they had been to and from school so were a bit crushed. This did help! Then I photographed the drawings. I was able to edit out some of the creases and shadows that were left after ironing, but not all. But I think the \u2018imperfection\u2019 of the photos shows their authenticity! \nI had the photos printed up, and together we chose packs of cards on which the photos would go. We chose these lovely pearlised ones, above. \nUnfortunately, the photos were just a little bigger than the cards, so I had to trim them down a bit. \nI had printed 2 copies of each drawing, so one copy could go on each coloured card. \nGlue them on using craft glue, and weigh them down to dry so they stay flat. \nWrap them up nicely in cellophane. I had a pretty cello bag in my wrapping paper stash, which was just the right size. Now they are perfect for gift giving! \nI would suggest when you take the photo of your child\u2019s artwork, that you don\u2019t crop them right down. When you get them printed up, they always seem to slightly crop them even further \ud83d\ude26 And it will give you more room to move when working out how you will position them on the cards. \nAnd I think they look the best when the photos are quite a bit smaller than the card, rather than just fitting. This gives a good border of card colour around the photo. The dog card on the top of the pile, above, was the best I could do to get this effect. Next year I\u2019ll have to remember this! \nYou could print the pictures up at home on normal paper, but I think they look very professional done as a photograph. \nYou could also embellish the finished card with glitter or other sparkle. Or add a tiny bit of colour to pencil drawings like these. But I like them just as they are. \nNow, it really doesn\u2019t matter what your child\u2019s level of artistic expertise is. They may be more Jackson Pollack than Michelangelo. But I promise you, a fingerpainting will look amazingly professional when presented beautifully on a card! And if the artwork is more of your abstract variety, just choose a bright portion of it to showcase. Your children will feel special that you have done something so amazing with their work, and that is a gift in itself x \nThis is quite a different style of card to what I made for my sister in Card Making, Part 1 . There are so many options for card making! \nLinking up with:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fiona  it", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson pollack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michelangelo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:16:33.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "659e7e2d40c1586129c37209a8cad71929f92443", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSnJ.Yrq7krp.kIBBhy9VcNOB_l4KeWYSfq9lSG5kPlBBq6yWmcaHhQkfYeCwfCp1IAocRko1K9P7EttYd_dKtU1AhBP6L5kuf_LuMFDMiOhWPAQ.VUPHN3HoB_HW4AqDGQMa_zXhBJqjXKNDM5UQLR", "site_full": "www.pulse.ng", "site": "pulse.ng", "site_section": "http://pulse.ng/rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "pulse.ng - Nigeria's entertainment & lifestyle platform online", "title": "Holiday: 5 family-friendly things to do this Christmas", "title_full": "Holiday: 5 family-friendly things to do this Christmas", "published": "2017-12-07T11:11:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.pulse.ng/img/incoming/crop7696817/1876704863-chorizontal-w1200-h630-q90/black-Family-playing-board-game.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4252, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "659e7e2d40c1586129c37209a8cad71929f92443", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSnJ.Yrq7krp.kIBBhy9VcNOB_l4KeWYSfq9lSG5kPlBBq6yWmcaHhQkfYeCwfCp1IAocRko1K9P7EttYd_dKtU1AhBP6L5kuf_LuMFDMiOhWPAQ.VUPHN3HoB_HW4AqDGQMa_zXhBJqjXKNDM5UQLR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Omotolani Odumade", "published": "2017-12-07T11:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "Holiday: 5 family-friendly things to do this Christmas", "text": "Family-friendly things to do this Christmas (Pintrest) 24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter!

securities fund manager, has grown its ILS assets under management significantly this year, rising 29% from $3.5 billion at the start of 2017 to now sit at $4.5 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s impressive growth from the ILS and reinsurance investments manager and positions the firm and its funds well to take advantage of market conditions at the key January 2018 reinsurance renewals.\nLeadenhall has been raising fresh capital from investors since the major catastrophe losses of the third and fourth quarters, adding $300 million in AuM since June 1st, a net increase following the hurricane losses which affected the ILS managers non-life portfolios.\nThe non-life component of Leadenhall\u2019s AuM is roughly $2.7 billion, and the life insurance linked investment component of the AuM is more than $1.8bn, the company said.\nLuca Albertini, CEO of Leadenhall, commented on the news, \u201cWe are implementing the plan for our non-life business growth which pre dated the loss events which affected the industry, but we have made adjustments to take advantage of new opportunities and the expected increase in returns for investments exposed to US perils.\u201d\nImportantly, Leadenhall is also managing its assets to ensure the can be deployed effectively at the renewals.\nAlbertini explained, \u201cWe are controlling the pace of funds inflow, which could have been significantly larger, to time it with the expected opportunities.\u201d\nLorenzo Volpi, Leadenhall\u2019s Head of Business Development, added, \u201cWe have been working closely with our existing investors, who fully understand the impact of the 2017 loss events on our portfolios.\n\u201cWe are pleased that our investors have increased, reloaded or maintained their investments with us, whilst at the same time adding major new investors to our funds after having reopened for subscriptions in November.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the $4.5 billion of AuM commanded by Leadenhall is as of December 1st and does not include subscriptions earmarked for 1st January deployments, which suggests the figure could rise in early 2018.\nJoin us in New York in February 2018 for our next ILS conference

Whaaa? \nYes, friends. Olive oil isn\u2019t just for savory dishes. It\u2019s flavor can pair wonderfully with nutty, citrusy, sweet notes. \nAlso, it being an oil and such, it makes any cake you bake it into incredibly moist. So Olive Oil Cake is a total winner in my book. \nBesides this cake being olive oil-y and lovely, I made it extra EXTRA moist by adding in ground pistachios. Basically any time you add nut flour into a cake, it creates a really silky texture. I\u2019ve done this multiple times now (see these teacakes and this cake ) and it\u2019s increds. \nI chose to add pistachios because their slightly floral notes pair well with olive oil. Plus, pistachios on cake are gorgeous amiright? \nOmg also let\u2019s talk about this olive oil! This is Lucini extra virgin olive oil . I became familiar with it a few years ago when we were at a family friends\u2019 house and the dad raved about it. I was like yeah but how good can it really be? \nWell, one bite of a crusty baguette dipped in Lucini later, I was like OH, THAT GOOD. OK I GET IT NOW. \nPoint being, I recommend using a high-quality extra virgin olive oil for this cake.
