Such hearings are not open to the public. \nOn Wednesday, Police Chief Ken Paulhus said no charges will be brought against the couple. The case is continued for six months and will be dismissed if they don't get into further trouble. \n\"We are disappointed. We wanted to see the case move forward,\" Paulhus said. \"We respect the court's decision, but we want to send a message to the community.\" \nHe said if there is evidence of underage drinking, the department will take steps to charge those responsible. \nState law says anyone who \u201cfurnishes\u201d alcohol to person under 21 can be fined $2,000, sentenced to a year in jail or both. \u201cFurnish\u201d is defined as \u201cknowingly or intentionally supply, give, provide to, or allow to possess alcoholic beverages on premises or property owned or controlled by the person charged,\u201d according to state law. \nThe couple could not be reached for comment Wednesday. \nPolice arrived at the home just after 11:45 p.m. on Oct. 28 after receiving a \"medical call involving a juvenile under the influence of alcohol,\" according to a press release. One drunken teenage girl ending up in the hospital. \nSouthborough police summoned the couple to court on charges of procuring liquor to a person under 21. \nThe couple expected about 40 teenagers at their 19 Liberty Drive home that night, but estimated 100 showed up, police said. \n\"Officers reported numerous juveniles running from the area (after police arrived),\" the release reads. \"Mr. Cosentino showed officers around the property and pool area to check for any other juveniles who might be in need of medical attention.\" \nOfficers saw a large number of empty beer cans and red party cups. No juveniles were arrested and the remaining teens were released to parents or guardians. \nJonathan Phelps can be reached at 508-626-4338 or jphelps@wickedlocal.com.

There, the professor\u2019s 17-year-old son, Elio (Timothee Chalamet), discovers his sexuality and pursues Oliver.\n\u201cCall Me\u201d is a passion project that\u2019s taken several years for legendary filmmaker James Ivory (\u201cA Room with a View\u201d), 89, to make.\nFor the 6-foot-5 Hammer, this intimate film arrived after big-budget flops \u201cThe Lone Ranger\u201d and \u201cThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.\u201d\nHaving failed to ignite as a conventional Hollywood hunk, Hammer was ready for a challenge.\n\u201cIf I started really caring how my movies did at the box office, I think I\u2019d lose sight about why I do this. I don\u2019t do this because I want to see how much box office I do opening weekend. I do this because I just love making movies and I can\u2019t imagine doing anything else.\n\u201cThis was really a case of I would have done anything to work with (director Luca Guadagnino, \u2018I Am Love.\u2019). I love his movies. Also, I read the book and as my wife pushed me to do it, she said, \u2018This is the sexiest book I\u2019ve ever read.\u2019\n\u201cIt seemed like an amazing opportunity, like a no-brainer.\u201d\nHammer was just 12 when the acting bug bit. But thanks to \u201cHome Alone\u201d?\n\u201cI was 12, come on!\u201d he said, then laughed. \u201cI saw the movie, went to sleep that night and dreamed I was Macaulay Culkin. It looked like the most fun job.\u201d\nAs for \u201cCall Me,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m not thinking it\u2019s a game changer or big career move. I was lucky I was able to do this for what I consider the right reason.\n\u201cNow,\u201d as he, Chalamet and Guadagnino find themselves in the heat of a Golden Globe/Oscar campaign, \u201cI\u2019m back with all the people I love and seeing them again.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "oscar", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "stephen schaefer", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "armie hammer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "timothee chalamet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james ivory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hammer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luca guadagnino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oliver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macaulay culkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chalamet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guadagnino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael stuhlbarg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "golden globe", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:57.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e645ab564124a0f46e908dfc23e1addb33788fa1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAimY5omxjUNKW.PCeb.F9sNE-", "site_full": "groups.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=categories/gmail/ask-a-how-to-question", "site_categories": ["business"], "section_title": "Gmail Help Forum - Google Product Forums", "title": "Phone contacts showing up in Gmail", "title_full": "Phone contacts showing up in Gmail - Google Product Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.99, "main_image": "http://www.google.com/images/icons/product/groups-128.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e645ab564124a0f46e908dfc23e1addb33788fa1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ8l2Gi_2QdtYzkTDXFl9m9u5kYD7BoZG4PRNvBqdajAc5QTBcd5LY4eksEH5KJ0k7apxtAUVLjoK.oaPys23MuYxMzF8Yx97zlCjZ0KkMAimY5omxjUNKW.PCeb.F9sNE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bfox1105", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Phone contacts showing up in Gmail", "text": "To the best of my knowledge, I have never logged into Gmail on my iPhone.

Gigantic spider web over azaleas. Norfolk Island. That is some spiders web. Gigantic spider web over azaleas. by denisbin \nBrief History of Norfolk as a Penal Settlement. As noted previously Norfolk was settled to provide flax fibre rope, flax sails and tree masts from Norfolk Island pine trees and also because it was uninhabited. It was also an island paradise with rich volcanic soils. Its only major drawback was its isolation and its lack of a good harbour. Its history falls into several phases. Phase One- 1788-1814. This phase was run along the same lines as the settlement of Sydney. Both men and women convicts were quartered here. The women were to work making flax rope and sails and the men were to do the building, road making, land clearing, agriculture and stone masonry work. Some free settlers came too. The settlement was centred on Kingston (then called Sydney) and nearby Arthur\u2019s Vale (watermill valley.) By 1806 the population had reached over 1,000 people. Then for financial reasons- the cost of sending supply ships from Sydney to Norfolk was too great- the evacuation of the island was ordered. Convicts and other settlers were moved to Van Diemen\u2019s Land- hence the settlements there of New Norfolk and Norfolk Plains (later Longford.) Phase Two- 1825-1855. This time the island was run as a total penitentiary for the worse offenders. There would be no escape from Norfolk Island. Conditions were harsh, severe and degrading. It was a place of extreme punishment. The worst commandant was Captain Turton. During the period 1840-44 conditions were slightly better. Free settlers were not encouraged to settle during this second phase but a few of the best behaved convicts were allowed to work small farms across the island. Massive government expenditure on the penitentiary meant that fine sandstone Georgian buildings were erected and like Port Arthur in Tasmania many of them still remain. A large prison was built in the 1840s, and the prison required large military barracks, large stores and Commissariat stores, officer headquarters, a large hospital etc and good quality homes for the prison and military officers on the island. Kingston remained the administration and shipping centre of the island. Phase Three \u2013 1856-. In the third phase some of the original stone buildings were dismantled or left to go to ruins. Some were burnt down or the stone re-used for other structures. But the major feature of this period was the introduction of 194 Pitcairn Islanders in 1856. Norfolk remained isolated and largely forgotten. At one stage the Governor of NSW (the British Crown representative in charge of the island) ordered that the Pitcairn Islanders could no longer reside in the former penal settlement buildings in Kingston. This was in 1908 just before the Commonwealth government took charge. The resentment of this change led to fires and some beautiful buildings being destroyed. In 1893 Norfolk got a telegraph office and an underwater cable link to the world via Canada. Soon it had a cable link to New Zealand and a cable station opened at Anson Bay in 1902. Once it became a territory of the new Australian federal government conditions improved a little. Shipping came irregularly but during World War Two the Australian government built an airstrip for defence reasons. Flights continued after the War and now the main linkage between Norfolk and Australia is by air. The federal government has also put more money into other facilities on the island including the Botanic Gardens, and all the restoration work at Kingston etc. Share this: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "van diemen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pitcairn islanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arthur\u2019s vale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commissariat", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "norfolk island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "port arthur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tasmania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "longford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anson bay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norfolk plains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "botanic gardens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new norfolk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norfolk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:59.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "809ae79a913a6872106ffcc2e35d02d3724cbd08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzhF1G_rUuTrW9H02Zk30otxSJXAu14Akt4vKY97MEdrQa0zx9avDDbDI.nr9eXfUI0O5yXv8XmMvqv_lKye4EN5PBUqC9iAFkWdlWNm0MhKg--", "site_full": "fv2giftgarden.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://fv2giftgarden.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Fv2GiftGarden", "title": "Farmville 2 Free Water Pack-Baby Bottle Pack-Power Pack And Fertilizer Pack", "title_full": "Farmville 2 Free Water Pack-Baby Bottle Pack-Power Pack And Fertilizer Pack", "published": "2017-12-07T12:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "809ae79a913a6872106ffcc2e35d02d3724cbd08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzhF1G_rUuTrW9H02Zk30otxSJXAu14Akt4vKY97MEdrQa0zx9avDDbDI.nr9eXfUI0O5yXv8XmMvqv_lKye4EN5PBUqC9iAFkWdlWNm0MhKg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "fv2 farmers (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "Farmville 2 Free Water Pack-Baby Bottle Pack-Power Pack And Fertilizer Pack", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to gift you with some Free Baby Bottle  and Water and Fertilizer Pack  , remembers that these links come from other Accounts and not are Zynga Rewards so only faster users can get them. \nCLICK FREE G\u0130FT PAGE ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "farmville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "free baby bottle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zynga rewards", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:59.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e89c473da8c53dc927942dd931a112c834a117cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWazXoCTPKl_UTPffvylPMQcxVESYMj89mz8SlZZJpwGp50jqvO7q94WlY9R5sU2a5OR1OLfXJ07r2m6YxPn0M9yP88z4H94dWRzYH3hYrMVMQ--", "site_full": "holidayplace.co.uk", "site": "holidayplace.co.uk", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["travel", "mexico_and_central_america", "hotels"], "section_title": "", "title": "Sunkissed getaways with freebies for all | The Holiday Place", "title_full": "Sunkissed getaways with freebies for all | The Holiday Place", "published": "2017-12-07T12:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.171, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e89c473da8c53dc927942dd931a112c834a117cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWazXoCTPKl_UTPffvylPMQcxVESYMj89mz8SlZZJpwGp50jqvO7q94WlY9R5sU2a5OR1OLfXJ07r2m6YxPn0M9yP88z4H94dWRzYH3hYrMVMQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cl James Jon Mark", "published": "2017-12-07T12:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "Sunkissed getaways with freebies for all | The Holiday Place", "text": "\u00a3250 off 328 days left Fabulous facilities, sheer luxury and relaxation await you at a stunning all inclusive oceanfront resort in the Dom Rep bavaro, dom rep 5.0 stars \nThis modern five-star resort on the white sands of pristine Bavaro Beach is the place to bring the whole family and take delight in the endless possibilities.

At the end of the day you find out that the only thing you are really in control of is how you feel about yourself. You can\u2019t control what people think about you or what they do to you. You can literally waste your life in trying to please them but you\u2019ll never get a guarantee your efforts are not in vain. How YOU react to others, though, is entirely up to you so be the person you want to meet!\nI read the story of a woman who\u2019s husband has been chased by an ex-girlfriend for years and \u201cshe wasn\u2019t a problem\u201d according to him. The woman felt so disrespected that started checking the photos and statuses of her exes. It wasn\u2019t purely out of spite. She just felt lonely and looked for affection because she wasn\u2019t getting it from the one person who should have been giving it to her. Don\u2019t be that woman. She may have been a victim, but she wasn\u2019t right.\nIf you fall into the trap of \u201cyou do me, I do you\u201d you are only doing yourself. Someone did you wrong and you try to reciprocate to show them how much it hurts? It won\u2019t work. You\u2019re not in control of how they feel. Your actions won\u2019t affect them the same way theirs affected you. Eventually you will end up doing more damage to yourself.\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight \u2013 I\u2019m not advocating for staying in a relationship where infidelity, whether physical or emotional, is constantly present. There\u2019s nothing more insulting and harder than loving a person who loves another, but guess what, if they are not treating you right, life will come for them. Trust me, it will. And when life hits you hard, you start rethinking your actions and looking for the reasons that put you in that mess. With a little bit of maturity you eventually realise that it was you that did something wrong along the way. Then again, not everyone reaches that level of maturity. Some people spend their lives blaming others for their own mistakes so teaching an old dog a new trick is neither your job nor your responsibility.\nThe only thing you can do is make sure you live a life that brings you peace of mind and your actions don\u2019t make you feel bad about yourself. Do you really believe making someone suffer because you\u2019ve been hurt will take your pain away? It won\u2019t. It can make it worse.\nAs a person who has lived or is currently living a situation like this you would ask what about that feeling of unfairness that is suffocating you and sucking away your happiness? That feeling is within yourself, which means you can control it. Find the way to do it. If it means you have to go\u2026 then you have to go. But I beg of you don\u2019t leave a friendship, marriage or any other relationship to show the other person they will miss you when you are gone. Chances are they won\u2019t if they could push you to the point where you start thinking about leaving. You\u2019d be acting the fool.\nIn cases where children are involved, as a parent you have the responsibility to think about them and how they will feel if a family breaks down. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to live a life of misery with someone who doesn\u2019t want you by their side. Always try to work it out first and in many cases that requires professional help. Don\u2019t be afraid to see it and take advantage of it. And if you tried and no tangible change is evident, then take your own direction and find the happiness you deserve.\nAnd also don\u2019t be the person that goes to stir some in other people\u2019s life. Nobody cares if you\u2019ve been hurt before or you missed your chance with someone. If it didn\u2019t work out then it wasn\u2019t meant to be. Get over it and move on.\nAlways remember that your actions affect others in multiple ways. You don\u2019t control their feelings but you do control your actions. If your primary objective is to make yourself happy or satisfied without a consideration of others you\u2019ll end up causing pain. That pain will come back to YOU\u2026 in multiple ways.\nAnd before someone assumes it\u2019s only women that act stupid on their emotions, did you guys read Jay-Z\u2019s confession about cheating on Beyonc\u00e9? He wasn\u2019t \u201cjust being a man\u201d looking for some good \u201cpiece of meat\u201d because he\u2019s got it under his roof, in his bed and he put a ring on it. Jay-Z was hurt for some reason, probably as a result of something Beyonc\u00e9 did or has been doing, and he shut down his emotions towards her, which led to infidelity. Men\u2019s emotions or lack of them towards a woman play a much bigger role in starting affairs than their \u201cnatural needs\u201d, as many claim. There\u2019s nothing natural in cheating, which is why I can\u2019t give any excuse to cheaters. It\u2019s a choice.\nBey also had a choice. She could have left and found happiness and respect elsewhere. Hellooo, we are talking about Beyonc\u00e9 here! But even for every ordinary man or woman there\u2019s plenty of other fish in the sea. Instead, she chose to work WITH HIM to rectify his wrong choice and they made something good out of it. Or at least, it seems this way. But all this became possible because he stepped up, owned his mistake and chose to put the efforts and time to make it right. If either of them was unwilling to try then their relationship would have been good to be thrown in the bin.\nIt\u2019s a little deep for a Thursday morning read, but if you take anything from me today it should be these 4:\nYou can only control your own feelings and actions. Two wrongs don\u2019t make it right. Think about others when you are making yourself happy. One person can\u2019t build a relationship for two. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beyonc\u00e9", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay-z", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:13:59.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "06e2830815cda59871602e73110b6ed83b98debe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_mqWVMRHJIEar.POct446Nr2bVVhf820ZRXS0PTm_lCQ--", "site_full": "www.unicancer.fr", "site": "unicancer.fr", "site_section": "http://www.unicancer.fr/rss-actualites-unicancer", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "UNICANCER - News Group and Centers", "title": "Securing the radiation therapy patient treatment path: a DOSIsoft \u2013 UNICANCER scientific partnership", "title_full": "Securing the radiation therapy patient treatment path: a DOSIsoft \u2013 UNICANCER scientific partnership", "published": "2017-12-07T01:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "06e2830815cda59871602e73110b6ed83b98debe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_mqWVMRHJIEar.POct446Nr2bVVhf820ZRXS0PTm_lCQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "webmaster", "published": "2017-12-07T01:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Securing the radiation therapy patient treatment path: a DOSIsoft \u2013 UNICANCER scientific partnership", "text": "  du Groupe \u00bb Securing the radiation therapy patient treatment path: a DOSIsoft \u2013 UNICANCER scientific partnership 07/12/2017 Securing the radiation therapy patient treatment path: a DOSIsoft \u2013 UNICANCER scientific partnership DOSIsoft, leading provider of advanced software solutions for radiation therapy, and UNICANCER, which groups together all French Comprehensive Cancer Centers (FCCCs), announce a scientific partnership, aiming at bringing an innovative solution to optimize patient safety in radiation therapy. This R&D partnership is established under the framework of the \u201ciNNOV\u2019Up Experimentation\u201d program, led by the French Paris Region and managed by public investment bank Bpifrance. Accelerating transfer of new products towards clinical routine \nDOSIsoft has developed a software solution, EPIbeam, that aims at evaluating before treatment the absorbed radiation dose which will be delivered to the patient. This software will complete the regulatory quality and safety controls, currently carried out on the linear accelerators, and thus will contribute to guarantee high-precision treatments for the patients with the latest generation of equipment. It allows to ensure before treatment that the absorbed delivered dose is identical to the planned absorbed dose (planned with the Treatment Planning System \u2013 TPS). The time allocated to treatment machine calibration measurements is also significantly reduced. \n\u201cThis experimentation is an excellent means to accelerate transfer of new products to clinical routine, by sharing lessons learned, concrete use cases, usability of these new products, and also the remaining improvements to be implemented before a wider deployment of solutions on the market, including the international market.\u201d welcomes Marc Uszynski, DOSIsoft CEO. Providing in real-time usable and relevant data regarding treatment quality \nAn experiment in real patient treatment conditions is currently taking place in 7 CLCCs: Jean-Perrin Center, Georges-Fran\u00e7ois Leclerc Center, the Jean-Godinot oncology Institute, the Curie Institute (Paris and Saint Cloud), the Oncology University Institute of Toulouse and the L\u00e9on B\u00e9rard Center. These centers are currently testing EPIbeam to evaluate its accuracy and relevance, and to propose, as appropriate, optimizations for a high performance under the real usability conditions of the CLCCs. \n\u201cUNICANCER promotes a model for oncology based on multidisciplinarity, personalization of treatments and a research-to-care continuum\u2026 As a major player in patient care and research in oncology, our objective with this experimentation is to obtain an increase in quality for patient care in radiation therapy, while ensuring treatment safety for the patient.\u201d said Christian Caillot, R&D Director of UNICANCER. \n\u201cIn addition to the quality and safety procedures used by the medical teams, this software solution has the advantage of providing data in real-time regarding treatment quality, by connecting to the existing equipment and without any need for additional hardware investment. This experimentation is part of the scientific partnerships carried out along the Research and Development axes with the CLCCs and defined within the Global Radiation Therapy Offer of UNICANCER \u201d underlines Luc Delporte, Purchasing Director of UNICANCER. \nThe conclusions of the experimentation are expected by the end of 2017. Beyond this partnership, DOSIsoft pursues its scientific collaborations with UNICANCER and all CLCCs for further improving patient care in radiation therapy.

Their fairytale story of back-to-back promotions was turning into a nightmare. \nReaching Serie A for the first time ever was supposed to be a moment to savour. Not leave a sour taste in the mouth. Benevento won promotion to Serie A through the play-offs \nBenevento's rise brought succour to a city, about an hour and a half's drive east of Naples, that had suffered greatly when flooding caused \u20ac1.2bn worth of damage to the region in 2015. They were a symbol of hope and offered an escape from life's problems for 90 minutes a week. \nNow they were a laughing stock. A punch-line. And clubs like Napoli used Benevento as a reason why Serie A needs to return to an 18-team format. Less quantity. More quality. \nBenevento's owner Oreste Vigorito hit back, pointing out Benevento had actually out-spent Napoli and seven other teams in the summer. \nThe trouble was it looked like a terrible waste of money, particularly when Benevento lost 6-0 at the San Paolo in September. \nResults like that did nothing to discourage the idea of Benevento being out of their depth. And when Marco Baroni got the sack a month later, the name of his replacement did not inspire great confidence. \nRoberto de Zerbi was a continuity appointment of sorts. His only top flight experience came at Palermo last season where he was fired after losing seven straight. Perfect for Benevento then, or so the joke went. \nIn the meantime, captain Fabio Lucioni tested positive for the banned substance clostebol. He is appealing against the decision and hopes to be cleared. The substance in question was in a spray used to treat a graze. \nAll it did was deepen the feeling Benevento were the Damned United. \nAnd yet it's not like they have been out-played every week. Eight of their 14 defeats have been by one goal. \nAnd if Serie A hadn't been experimenting with Video Assistant Referees, Benevento would have registered their first point back in August. Alberto Brignoli is on loan at Benevento from Juventus \nWhat made Brignoli's equaliser all the more satisfying on Sunday is the number of times his team has lost in stoppage time themselves, often in comical circumstances. \nIn October, Benevento drew level with Cagliari in injury time only to concede again with seconds to spare. \nThen three weeks ago their wait for a point again looked over when Sassuolo's Domenico Berardi missed a penalty in added time. All Benevento had to do was see out one last corner. But even that was beyond them. \nBrignoli made a Taibi-like gaffe in that game. \nBut De Zerbi retained faith in him and was rewarded on Sunday. On returning home that night, Brignoli received a hero's welcome. There was a banner and a bottle of bubbly waiting for him outside his apartment. \nSprayed in red paint was the message: \"GRANDE ALBERTO!!! THANK YOU!!!\" \nReflecting on Brignoli's goal, Taibi recalls how the one he scored for Reggina very nearly helped keep them up. \n\"Even if we lost our next two games, from that moment our season changed. It created a positive atmosphere around the club and we fought for survival right until the end\u2026\" \nIt didn't stop Reggina being relegated in a play-off with Verona. \"But those last two months were special,\" Taibi said. \nFor now, all Benevento have got is a point to their name. The number one. The same as a goalkeeper wears fittingly. \nThey may be last but Brignoli's goal is arguably one of the first things people will remember about this season in Serie A for years to come.

Refusing both gainsays common sense.\nNigerian Academy Fielder Expresses Readiness To Play Professional Soccer \nFreeze said during an interview with Linda Ikeji Television that \u201cIf you pay tithe to any Pastor at all, you are a goat, let alone to a pastor that has his face on the tithe ATM card, drives a Rolls Royce and just bought his wife a G- Wagon; I have heard people argue that such monies were being given to God and not to pastors\u201d he noted.\nContinuing Freeze added that \u201ctransfer of earthly wealth to spiritual wealth was done in the Bible, in Mathew 25 and it has nothing to do with pastors. If you want to give money to Jesus, the Bible said, it is those who are in the hospitals, people who are naked, homeless, hungry because Jesus said, if you remember those people, you remember me and not those who fly private jets\u201d.\nWith the increasing fissure between poor tithe payers and their extravagant pastors, one in his right senses, should question whether the scriptural injunction to tithe is not being misinterpreted, misapplied to subject Christians under the whims and caprices of money adoring monks.\nFreeze is not at all alone in this movement; Preacher and coordinator of Healing Wings, Dr. Femi Aribisala, had earlier in his published articles called pastors who collect tithe thieves.\nSARS: IGP Order, Nigerians Vs Constituted Police Law \nHe said, \u201cThere are so many things that are \u201cbiblical\u201d but have nothing to do with the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is about God and his sons; the son of a king does not pay taxes to the king, his father. Sons of God don\u2019t tithe; tithe means giving ten per cent of your income to God however, everything that sons of God have belongs to God.\n\u201cSo tithing cannot apply to us; the tithing currently instituted in churches is all 419; money is not acceptable as tithe in the scriptures yet, our thieving pastors today only accept money; tithes were only paid by landowners in the scriptures, but our thieving pastors collect tithes from everybody.\n\u201cTithes were only collected by Levites, but thieving pastors, who are neither Jewish nor Levites, are now the ones collecting them; tithes were meant for the poor, the widows and strangers in the scriptures, but our thieving pastors now use them to build their empires; they use them to build cathedrals; buy jets establish schools and banks etc. Those pastors who collect tithes today are nothing but thieves and robbers\u201d Aribisala wrote.\nExplaining Malachi 3:10 which most Pentecostal pastors use to influence church members to tithe Aribisala that the Old Testament scripture doesn\u2019t infer tithe payment.\n\u201cMalachi 3:10 does not establish the principles of tithing; the principles were established by Moses. Malachi is addressed to priests; it is not addressed to the congregation; Malachi is Old Testament; we are now under a New Testament.\n\u201cPastors cannot insist on the one hand that we are no longer under the law, and then cherry-pick a convenient aspect of the law as being still applicable today; if we should pay tithes today then we should also obey other aspects of the Mosaic law including stoning disobedient children and adulterers to death; Malachi is not our Lord and Saviour; Jesus is our Lord and Saviour. Christians should be instructed by Jesus and not by Malachi or Moses\u201d, he said.\nJesus in Matthew 23:23, said: \u201cWoe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others\u201d.\nBut most times, church goers aren\u2019t in a position to query their pastors even when they are disturbed by the ugly trend\u2014people being asked to pay tithe in order to get blessed by God what contradicts what was written in Genesis 14:19-20 about Abram who first paid tithe to Melchizedek in appreciation of God\u2019s authority to bless man\u2014after he was blessed.\nReggae music stars Max Romeo and Upsetters during May 20, 2011 Brighton Festival, England, opened the eyes of audience with the song titled stealing in the name of the Lord. Lyrics below:\n\u201cStealing, stealing, stealing, Stealing, stealing; Stealing in the name of the Lord. My father\u2019s house of worship, has become a den of thieves; Stealing in the name of the Lord. They fed our mothers with sour grapes, and set our teeth on edge; Stealing in the name of the Lord. Strike the hammer of justice, and set my people free, Strike the hammer of justice, or let my people be. They tell us of a heaven, Where milk and honey flow; Stealing in the name of the Lord. They said this place called heaven; the rich man cannot go; stealing in the name of the Lord. Yet the reverend drives a fancy car, Buys everything tax-free, the people have to sacrifice; to give in charity. This song ever since had stimulated lots of commentaries on British press many years after.\nSince the Nigerian tithe controversy began some Pastors of Pentecostal extraction had spoken. The General Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor E. A Adeboye while responding to the tithe controversy advised Christians especially his members to avoid dangers associated to not paying tithe. In his sermon titled Breaking Forth, he said, \u201cI have said it before and I will say it again and again, if your physical father curse you, it can be cancelled by your spiritual father, if your spiritual father curse you it can be cancelled by the general overseer, if your general overseer curse you, you can fast and pray to your father in heaven but if God curses you, where will you go.\n\u201cI know who is talking and I did not want to worry myself about such person; please do not let anybody get you into trouble by attracting God\u2019s curse to yourself; pay your tithe\u201d, Adeboye said in response to Freeze\u2019s previous statement.\nMost Rev Eke said, \u201cNothing is wrong with tithing, it is in the Bible and very biblical; the issue is not whether it is right or wrong but the controversy it has generated is because of what it is used for; for the fact that you are being blessed, you have to recognize that there is someone doing all that for you, and you need to show him that you are grateful\u201d, he said adding that salvation is soul is most important.\n\u201cWhat is paramount is the soul, and not sacrament, we must draw closer to God and fear him because, after all said and done, the salvation of every soul is the most essential thing.\u201d\nApostle Johnson Suleiman, President of the Omega Fire Ministries worldwide, said, \u201cThere are things people should not just dabble into especially when it is not their field. Even if you mobile the whole world against tithing you will only end up being counterproductive because it is not your field. Men of God do not need to react to such issues because like I said earlier, once somebody has made up his mind on a position, nobody should argue with such a man. My reaction to such a man is if that is your position, keep it, continue with what you believe but don\u2019t confuse people to believe what you believe\u201d, Suleiman said.\nPaul Adefarasin, Senior Pastor over House on the Rock, said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pay tithe in this new covenant; tithing will not make you a millionaire; you don\u2019t pay tithe to be blessed; you are already blessed; tithing is a faith response to the blessing. Abraham paid tithe after he was blessed not so that he would be blessed; Abraham paid tithe to Melchizedek who was a high priest; we pay to Jesus Christ our high priest after the order of Melchizedek. In the new era even if you don\u2019t pay, there is no curse; there\u2019s no curse for the child of God in Christ, only blessing\u201d, Adefarasin explained while ministering to members of his congregation.\nAt the moment, big questions seeking answers are: Is Church a business empire tailored towards making money? Why are schools built by Church founders using tithe payers\u2019 money so expensive to the extent that majority of their tithing congregation can\u2019t afford attendance of such institutions of learning? If the Church can\u2019t love its members can it love the world?\nIt is on record today in Nigeria that, Landmark University a private Christian University located in Omu Aran, Kwara State, charges N556, 000 for courses such as such as Sociology, Political Science etc while Engineering cost N669, 000.\nCovenant University located in Ota, Ogun State students pay N774, 500 for courses such as Banking and Finance, Economic and Development studies, Business management while engineering programmes go for N814, 000 for per session.\nBenson Idahosa University located in Benin City, Edo state charges N278, 000 to N1, 150, 000 per session.\nIn Babcock University, students pay between N244, 000 and N482, 000 to study in their first session alone.\nIn Redeemer\u2019s University located at Ede, off Gbongan-Oshogbo Road, Osun state, students pay N110, 000 as one year tuition fee; tuition fees and other fees running into N695, 000.\nWhile at Ajayi Crowther Ajayi Crowther University is located in Oyo state students are made to pay between N395, 000 and N690, 000 yearly. This is just to mention few.\nPastors consider young teenagers, in your church who drop out of school for the reason that their Church going parent cannot afford their school.\n\u201cIt is easy to love the people far away. It is not always easy to love those close to us. It is easier to give a cup of rice to relieve hunger than to relieve the loneliness and pain of someone unloved in our own home. Bring love into your home for this is where our love for each other must start\u201d, said Mother Teresa.\nIn a nutshell, besides controversy, Pastors have to admit that some members of their congregation have needs that should be addressed financially; most youths going to churches are unemployed, they only dress to look good on Sundays.

But strategists said the currency would trade in narrow ranges until the release of the closely watched non-farm payrolls report on Friday. \nBitcoin soared to a record high of more than $14,500, up almost 7 percent on the day and continuing a staggering surge from less than $1,000 at the beginning of the year. \nSTOCKS RECOVER \nEuropean stock markets appeared to take their cues from a general recovery in tech stocks overnight in Asia and Wall Street. \nThe pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.2 percent with tech stocks initially up 0.5 percent. Financials, industrials and healthcare shares also added points to the index. \n\u201cWe have seen some aggressive moves in Asia, whereas Europe seems to be a bit more subdued,\u201d said David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets in London. \n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like European markets look for an excuse to selloff but it takes them a lot to be convinced to actually push higher.\u201d \nShares in the energy sector, which weighed on shares earlier in Wall Street and Asia, rose in Europe, as oil prices recovered from a big fall on Wednesday. \nUS West Texas Intermediate crude futures traded at $56.13 per barrel in European trade, up 0.3 percent on the day. \nBrent futures gained 0.4 percent to $61.45 per barrel. \nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.2 percent as some technology bellwethers rebounded, with Tencent rising over 3 percent and Alibaba more than 2 percent. \nIn Japan, the Nikkei jumped 1.5 percent, recouping much of its 2.0 percent loss the previous day, which was its biggest fall since late March. \nThe price of copper, seen as a barometer of global economic health because of its extensive industrial use, also fell sharply earlier this week, raising worries about the world growth outlook. \nCopper traded at $6,576 a tonne, up 0.5 percent on the day and above a two-month low of $6,507.5 touched on Tuesday. \nCopyright Reuters, 2017 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david madden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jane foley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tencent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rabobank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cmc markets", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united st", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia-pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:14:00.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ad0434aa1cc2cbf757c74bc21a4f379b7bad80d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhP2dAuhxdskwwPKUqVNRVR2bMcg_lqwr_LoXqPYC6iIVgaDp6gEWmKqkPnJqv_OWcOM5ROS4gpEi1XBoXBrFRBe2hNjIYOTDsYJ0RqDv.Pk431LmRmkHlM53BTN.8XUeME", "site_full": "www.military-technologies.net", "site": "military-technologies.net", "site_section": "http://www.military-technologies.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["table_tennis_ping_pong", "financial_news", "finance", "sports"], "section_title": "MilTech", "title": "Antithrombotic Drugs Market Excessive Growth Opportunities Estimated to be Experienced by 2025", "title_full": "Antithrombotic Drugs Market Excessive Growth Opportunities Estimated to be Experienced by 2025", "published": "2017-12-07T10:33:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8ad0434aa1cc2cbf757c74bc21a4f379b7bad80d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ih4l.3it1ZKEqXsQa_vaBsuSm0Hnv4ud_anWhek_OLy5n8YZPgqhP2dAuhxdskwwPKUqVNRVR2bMcg_lqwr_LoXqPYC6iIVgaDp6gEWmKqkPnJqv_OWcOM5ROS4gpEi1XBoXBrFRBe2hNjIYOTDsYJ0RqDv.Pk431LmRmkHlM53BTN.8XUeME", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Persistence Market Research", "published": "2017-12-07T10:33:00.000+02:00", "title": "Antithrombotic Drugs Market Excessive Growth Opportunities Estimated to be Experienced by 2025", "text": "Source: imported from this press release . \nThrombosis is may be defined as the formation of blood clot in the blood vessel or lumen part of the blood vessel.
