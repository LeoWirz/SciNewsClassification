First of all, it is an estimator of the posterior distribution (see What is the difference between an estimator and a statistic? ). Second, as already noticed in the comment by @whuber , a statistic is a function of the data, while posterior distribution is a function of the data and the priors, so it depends not only on the data. \nPosterior distribution is an estimate of the distribution of the parameter of the assumed model; statistic would be a function of the sample that characterizes it. The problem is not with the fact that it is a distribution (e.g. one could argue that kernel density estimator, as well as histogram, are statistics), but with your interest in the model, rather then the sample. \nOn another hand, the definition of statistic is very broad and many handbooks give only brief definitions ( \"function of the sample\" , or \"numerical characteristic of a sample\" ), or like Leehman and Casella in Theory of Point Estimation say that \"estimators are statistics\" (p. 16). So when sticking to the definition that statistic is any function of the sample, the answer would be \"yes\". Do Bayesians use the term \"statistic\" in the same way that frequentists do, or does Bayesian inference not depend as heavily on the concept of a statistic? \nIn general, Bayesians use all of the statistical terms the same way as other statisticians. They only differ in how they interpret the probability , while sticking to the same definitions (Kolomogorov axioms etc.). If they didn't, they wouldn't be able to communicate with the rest of statistical community and would not be considered as a part of statistics.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kolomogorov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "casella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leehman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:12.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9caac18c7bb9a238f4542d4b8f3dbcafe3242aff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_XCqqqI7R4P6K5g4XUY3PUF0.5AVwpCDIRYoLrWzuQcGOo1CKKnvuePBQinKZlzTJ7r0VRlDakW4CCoiDRlYO07HaKV7.WyrN5g6G1CyNH2A--", "site_full": "www.newson6.com", "site": "newson6.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Broken Arrow To Soon Roll Out Curbside Recycling - NewsOn6.com - Tulsa, OK - News, Weather, Video and Sports - KOTV.com |", "title_full": "Broken Arrow To Soon Roll Out Curbside Recycling - NewsOn6.com - Tulsa, OK - News, Weather, Video and Sports - KOTV.com |", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.164, "main_image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/15573686_G.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33730, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9caac18c7bb9a238f4542d4b8f3dbcafe3242aff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_XCqqqI7R4P6K5g4XUY3PUF0.5AVwpCDIRYoLrWzuQcGOo1CKKnvuePBQinKZlzTJ7r0VRlDakW4CCoiDRlYO07HaKV7.WyrN5g6G1CyNH2A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Broken Arrow To Soon Roll Out Curbside Recycling - NewsOn6.com - Tulsa, OK - News, Weather, Video and Sports - KOTV.com |", "text": "Broken Arrow To Soon Roll Out Curbside Recycling Posted: \nHundreds of Broken Arrow homeowners will soon be able to participate in curbside recycling. \nThe city council approved two pilot programs that will run for four months. \nThe city will test the two methods for collecting recyclables. \nOne would continue collecting trash in bags but would add a plastic cart just for recycling. \nThe other program would use two carts: one for trash, one for recycling. \nThe city will gather information on which method people like best.

Reynolds has just been cast as the titular character in Detective Pikachu , the first live-action (plus CGI) Pok\u00e9mon movie (via Variety ). \nDetective Pikachu isn\u2019t the Pikachu \u2014 at least not the one you probably remember as the partner of one Ash Ketchum. Based on the 3DS game Great Detective Pikachu , a spin-off of the main Pok\u00e9mon franchise released in Japan in 2016, the film features a Pikachu who can talk and fancies himself as a great detective, and his assistant, a young boy, as they go about solving crime. Legendary Entertainment acquired the rights to a film adaptation in July 2016 \u2014 around the time that the Pok\u00e9mon Go! phenomenon was exploding \u2014 and Alex Hirsch and Nicole Perlman penned the script. Goosebumps\u2019 Rob Letterman will direct. \nFollowing the release of the Great Detective Pikachu game in Japan last year, fans speculated as to who could voice Pikachu in an English-language version. Danny DeVito was by far the fan favourite, with an online petition encouraging Nintendo to cast him attracting almost 40,000 signatures. Alas, when the idea was brought to DeVito, he was unfamiliar with Pokemon and said he would not voice the character. With DeVito not an option, producers looked to Dwayne Johnson, Mark Wahlberg, and Hugh Jackman before ultimately deciding on Reynolds. \nReynolds joins a cast which already includes Paper Towns\u2019 Justice Smith as the human lead, and Kathryn Newton playing a journalist. Variety reports that the film\u2019s story will revolve around the kidnapping of Smith\u2019s character\u2019s father. Filming on Detective Pikachu will begin in January 2018. Like what you see?

Your favourite app has heard your cries. Instagram is now giving you the option to archive your stories. \nvia GIPHY \nThe new feature does two things. It allows you to keep your escapades either in Stories Archive \u2013 it automatically and privately saves all your stories \u2013 or in Stories Highlights \u2013 the option of storing the ones you want the world to see. Talk about a game-changer! A post shared by Instagram (@instagram) on Dec 5, 2017 at 7:04am PST \nNow, instead of scrambling to save Insta Stories before they reach their 24-hour expiration date, they\u2019re stored in neat categories for you to keep on returning to them \u2026 forever. \nThe app is rolling the new feature out and you should expect the notification when you log in. \nThis does mean that you can expect Instagram to look a little bit different from now on. If you enable Archives, your stories will be visible along with the rest of the content you save.

(Reuters photo) - + TOKYO: The Slovenian-based bitcoin miner NiceHash says it is investigating a security breach and the possible theft of tens of millions of dollars' worth of bitcoins, as the value of the virtual currency has soared to a new record high. \nNiceHash said Thursday in a statement posted on its website that it had stopped operations for 24 hours and was working to verify how many bitcoins were taken. \nThere was no immediate response from NiceHash to an emailed request for more details. Unconfirmed reports said more than 4,000 bitcoins were missing valued at more than $60 million. \n\u201cThe incident has been reported to the relevant authorities and law enforcement and we are cooperating with them as a matter of urgency,\u201d it said. \nThe statement urged users to change their online passwords. \nTroubles with the website over the past day or so drew alarm and complaints, with many bitcoin owners posting panicked comments on NiceHash's social media accounts. \nThe price of bitcoin surged to 487,505 baht at 4.30pm, gaining more than 20% in less than a day, according to Google Finance. That compares with a value below 30,000 baht at the beginning of the year. \nBitcoin is the world's most popular digital currency. Such currencies are not tied to a bank or government and allow users to spend money anonymously. They are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they are traded. Miners of bitcoins and other virtual currencies help keep the systems honest by putting computer power into a blockchain, a global running tally of every transaction that prevents cheaters from spending the same digital coin twice. \nNiceHash is a cryptocurrency mining application that lends computer power to verify bitcoin users' transactions. \nOnline security is a vital concern for such dealings. \nIn Japan, following the failure of a bitcoin exchange called Mt Gox, new laws were enacted to regulate bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. Mt Gox shut down in February 2014, saying it lost about 850,000 bitcoins, possibly to hackers. Bitcoin just hit $14,000 ...and it could be headed even higher https://t.co/WUIthyroCO pic.twitter.com/ftGDzeA9aN ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nicehash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mt gox", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nicehash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google finance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin center nyc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:13.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dda75c0ef11e8cf6831a78eb4212ea7daf691a07", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8vUdzJk69cXLbt6Og5ndAlgtfCJTNxg62rYaDUD89A9b0MkFR8J2RIEHE.k0_uq.k-", "site_full": "www.akfiles.com", "site": "akfiles.com", "site_section": "http://www.akfiles.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=2", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "General Discussion - The AK Files Forums", "title": "fenix 3200 lumens", "title_full": "fenix 3200 lumens - The AK Files Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T12:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 73634, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a89d028c668a013fb5951ac873bfa43c9887164a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8vUdzJk69cXLbt6Og5ndAlgtfCJTNxg62rYaDUD89A9b0MkFR8J2RITJ5aG7xa71iL_R1Umi89Zd_dzdo0T4Qd", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "nalioth", "published": "2017-12-06T13:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : And couldn't the beam hurt the operator eyes just from the brightness?

Obiano on his re-election, we urge him to implement his legacy projects. \n\u201c The one that is important to us is the airport, located at Umuleri. We understand that a Chinese firm is handling it and it is expected to be completed in 36 months,\u201d Onyekumnaru said. \nHe said that with the state-owned Orient Refinery situated in Aguleri, the airport would become a major hub in West Africa. \n\u201c The airport is designed to handle cargo. Majority of the business community in the South-East are from Anambra. \n\u201cIt will encourage them to import cargo direct from any part of the world, instead of going through Lagos or Abuja. \n\u201c Besides, when the refinery is completed, it will produce aviation fuel. This will make easy for major airlines to refuel in Anambra instead of going to Ghana. \n\u201c The good news is that the refinery is not far from the airport, \u201c the chairman said. \nAccording to him, the airport will also serve as an export hub for the business community in the country. \n\u201c Our expectation is that in the next 36 months, Anambra will be a major business hub for aviation, oil and gas sectors. \n\u201cNigerians will certainly key into this venture for the development of the state and country, \u201d Onyekumnaru said.

All\u00ed estaban su mural decorado con telas Liberty   en aros de bordar, sus estanter\u00edas llenas de madejas de colores, sus kits de labores... \nSi por mi fuera me hubiera pasado todo el d\u00eda en la tienda , viendo con calma cada madeja, tela, libro... y decidiendo qu\u00e9 comprar pero como no viajaba sola no pod\u00eda ser. As\u00ed que en base a mi experiencia en otros viajes (en los que he visitado tiendas que me encantan sin ser capaz de decidir qu\u00e9 comprar) hice los \"deberes\" antes del viaje y prepar\u00e9 mi lista de la compra con antelaci\u00f3n . \nPuede parecer una tonter\u00eda, pero a m\u00ed me resulta muy pr\u00e1ctico.

In fact, I  learned to knit because I wanted to make all the patterns and ideas I saw on their Web . \n\nSo on  my trip to New York  it was a must visit and once I was there I couldn't really believe it. There they were their wall decorated with Liberty fabrics on embroidery hoops, their shelves full of colour skeins, their crafts kits... \n\nIf it was up to me  I would have spent the whole day in the shop , calmly looking at each skein, fabric, book... and choosing what to buy but as I was not traveling alone it couldn't be. So basing on my experience from previous trips (where I have visited shops I love without being able to decide what to buy)  I made my \"homework\" before the trip and I prepared a shopping list in advance . \n\nIt may seem a little bit silly, but for me it is really practical. On the one hand I have a lot of  unused balls at home and on the other hand I don't have much time to knit, so I  didn't want to buy something that was going to be stashed indefinetely . That's why a couple of days before the trip I took a look at their Web, I decided what design to make and I wrote down what I had to buy and I think it was the best thing I could do. \n\nTo be honest I was quite sure since the beginning that I was going to buy something from   Knit Collage   as their yarns are my favourites because they are very special and in Spain it is not easy to find them so as it was to expect... a wonderful skein of   Wanderlust   came with  me from New York and it is going to become something really really cool which is also knitted very fast. \n\nFor sure, if I ever come back I will try to escape alone to spend as much time as I can nosing around the shop... \n\n\n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "purl soho", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nueva york", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nueva york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:13.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ed21b875e7b536e884dcf5934865385ea5400ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTgow94tiFnuGKic2q_T9Gv3dWZO2TqLEs0knL.M9VZPg4neqf7hIFGiiZ9UUnb2TQkvFapEdwJCYpW2Y7sPgpJWSXY_JUFw6H60r_Lvc4CMeVUNYDWklnWQBffzGh9mApBd1.xAKX_936yPudTJMbP02tryw.shl4-", "site_full": "ruthathome224.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://ruthathome224.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Advent 2 \u2013 Stars in the heavens \u2013 Thursday 7th December\u00c2\u00a0\u2013 1 Thessalonians 1:2-10 \u2013 A 'Saint' in the making", "title": "Advent 2 \u2013 Stars in the heavens \u2013 Thursday 7th December\u00c2 \u2013 1 Thessalonians 1:2-10", "title_full": "Advent 2 \u2013 Stars in the heavens \u2013 Thursday 7th December\u00c2 \u2013 1 Thessalonians 1:2-10", "published": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ed21b875e7b536e884dcf5934865385ea5400ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTgow94tiFnuGKic2q_T9Gv3dWZO2TqLEs0knL.M9VZPg4neqf7hIFGiiZ9UUnb2TQkvFapEdwJCYpW2Y7sPgpJWSXY_JUFw6H60r_Lvc4CMeVUNYDWklnWQBffzGh9mApBd1.xAKX_936yPudTJMbP02tryw.shl4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ruthathome224", "published": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Advent 2 \u2013 Stars in the heavens \u2013 Thursday 7th December\u00c2 \u2013 1 Thessalonians 1:2-10", "text": "\nFor we know, brothers and sisters beloved by God, that he has chosen you, v4 \nAre we still excited about the Christmas story, or has it been consumed into the annual 21st-century shopping event?

Founded by our Boss Bomb Maude Garrett and featuring a Bomb Squad filled with diverse, talented, and totally badass ladies, Geek Bomb has a mindset much like Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt : Females are strong as hell. And it\u2019s about time we start celebrating that again. So, we\u2019ve decided to relaunch Women in Geek , our interview series that spotlights, shows off, and talks about the wonderful ladies who are leading the geek entertainment field. \nJoining us this week is Alice Lawrence , a concept artist and digital matte painter whose creations are sure to leave you breathless. We had the chance to have a chat with Alice about how she began her career in art, how she hopes the industry will evolve moving forward, and the advice she\u2019d give to those looking to forge their own path in her field. \nBe sure to check out some of Alice\u2019s incredible work at the end of this interview. \nGeek Bomb : First off, when did you realize that you were, in essence, a geek? What geeky things are you up to now? Alice Lawrence : The first I might have realized this was when all I wanted to do, as soon as I got home from school was play Pokemon on my GameBoy and watch shows like Sailor Moon and DragonBall Z . At that point, my love for Pokemon became so all-consuming that I even started dreaming about playing the games in my sleep. As for my recent geek ventures, I am once again falling in love with Fallout 4 \u2013 to the extent that I just bought a vault suit onesie. \nGB : Let\u2019s get our foot in the door by asking how you got your foot in the door. What\u2019s your industry origin story \u2013 how did you get started? What advice can you give to those looking to break into your industry? AL : I was actually pretty fortunate to get to where I am now. After working for a few years as a matte painter in the VFX industry, the stress of working overtime was starting to get to me. I knew at that point, that I needed a change or I was soon to burn out. It was then that my current boss contacted me about a position as a concept artist for Ubisoft Montreal. I was ecstatic and took the job immediately and have not a single regret to date. My advice would be to ignore those who discourage you by saying that it\u2019s \u201ctoo tough.\u201d Cling to your mentors and those who inspire you, because they may very well become your support system. Moreover, it is important to network online; get an ArtStation and a Twitter account going and follow artists you love. Most importantly, of course, don\u2019t stop drawing. \nGB : What is the most difficult obstacle that you\u2019ve had to overcome in your industry or maybe even still overcoming? AL : I have always had difficulty believing in my skills. To this day, even now that I have landed my \u201cdream job,\u201d some days I\u2019m just feeling more confident than others. I\u2019m still learning new things about being a concept artist on a daily basis, which is a huge privilege for me because I love to learn. And so, slowly I\u2019m becoming more confident in my abilities. I think this is just something I\u2019ll feel better about the more I progress in the industry. \nGB : Picture yourself at ten years old. What advice would you give her? What would she love to know about present-day you? AL : Don\u2019t. Stop. Drawing. Keep coming up with stories/characters, and don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you can\u2019t turn your passion into a career, because its \u201chard work.\u201d Especially do not let boys tell you that you can\u2019t play a video game because you\u2019re a girl. Also keep all your GameBoys, your PS1, Beanie Babies, and Pokemon cards. Ten-year-old me would probably be surprised that she\u2019s drawing digitally for a living. \nGB : Who are your female role models and/or inspirations? AL : First and foremost is my mom. She\u2019s supported me since the first awfully botched anime drawings I would show her to anything I strive to do now. She is my rock and I\u2019d be absolutely nowhere without her. I also took an environment design class with Donglu Yu and I was just blown away by her confidence, techniques, and skills. She\u2019s worked on many great game titles and has a crazy amazing color palette. Other lady artists to name a few are Lois Van Baarle, Audra Auclair, [and]Jen Bartel. Aloy from Horizon Zero Dawn \nGB : Who are some of your favourite fictional female characters of all time? AL : 100 percent Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon. I really identify with her and have, ever since I was kid. She is loyal, silly, clumsy, loves video games and food \u2014 so, perfection. I also love Alana from Saga , who is the embodiment of sass, beauty and badassery. Akasha from Queen of the Damned is also dear to me, because it\u2019s my best friend\u2019s and my favourite movie. Of course, I can\u2019t forget Aloy from Horizon Zero Dawn for being so powerful and strong-willed! \nGB : How would you like to see this industry grow for not only women, but within the entertainment space? AL : I know we are definitely out there, but I\u2019d love to see more women in concept art. The video game industry is changing and is diverting from the male dominated industry that it used to be. So, I would absolutely love to see more female artists pursue a career in concept art. \nGB : Where can people discover more about you?

For instance, consider an iid sample of size $2n$. I will estimate the median of the population by using a coin flip to choose among the $n$th and $n+1$st largest values in the sample. According to your definition this is not a statistic, because it is not a \"deterministic\" procedure (although it is a statistic according to a common more general definition). It also is a reasonably good estimator. So I am wondering just what kind of object you have in mind when you refer to an \"estimator\" that is not a \"statistic.\" \u2013 whuber \u2666 Jan 15 '13 at 13:31 Yeah I would argue that \"choosing a value\" is the deterministic statistic and everything beforehand is related to modification of the sample you chose from. Then again since the \"procedure\" if you will - is deterministic I may just allow stochastic elements such this in my definition of statistic... Point beeing that estimators which are not a statistic could be at least those which are independent of any data. For example the number \"6\" in the answer below. Please note that I did not say that non-statistic estimators are necessarily bad. \u2013 IMA Jan 17 '13 at 7:52 I think perhaps you are making too many fine distinctions which are unnecessary and, in the end, complicate your exposition. For example, \"1/2\" is a great estimator of the parameter of a Bernoulli variable (it is minimax for quadratic loss), so it would be a shame to rule it out just because it is independent of the data. (That would be analogous to ruling out squares as examples of rectangles in Euclidean geometry: you could do that, but that would then double the lengths of most statements concerning properties of rectangles.) It similarly helps not to rule out randomized statistics. \u2013 whuber \u2666 Jan 17 '13 at 15:28 I don't think we are really talking about the same thing. Where do I rule out anything? If one-half is a great estimator, then it is a case where it is. I just don't think that the majority of possible estimators not beeing statistics are pretty great. For a Bernoulli variable \"1/2\" is good. But -quite- a few other estimators from the class \"A real number\" are not very good, wouldn't you agree? On the matter of randomized statistics still based on data- I didn't rule it out as I would still say you will require a deterministic procedure. But I concede that I should add this above. \u2013 IMA Jan 18 '13 at 8:08 up vote 3 down vote \nI think a better understanding about what is a sample helps. \nfrom wikipedia : \nA random sample is defined as a sample where each individual member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected as part of the sample. \nAn estimator is a function of a sample. A sample is actually a set of (say, $n$) i.i.d. random variables. That means an estimator is also a function of random variables. An estimator defines a measurement, but not the values of an actual measurement. But we can call it, \"the rule for estimating a given quantity based on observed data.\" Because based on $n$ specific experiments, we can have $n$ specific values for the $n$ i.i.d. random variables. And we get a specific value of the size-$n$ sample. \nWe replace the sample in the estimator by the value of the sample. We get a value of the estimator, this is a specific measure. And this specific measure is a statistic. \n(Check this link for the definition of an estimator, the last sentence reveals why we are always confused.)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bernoulli", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:15:14.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "620903e107093333a0a92bafd356da429ebdf5d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.eS2ELS3ZJxtNHA0.k8wGU9P.eDRAvgJLyn3M3YNdnHgQM0C4g56u1EigR.QPczhAV1SU8_.fsqicS4q0VkNTR", "site_full": "www.thepolicestationrepsukblog.co.uk", "site": "thepolicestationrepsukblog.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.thepolicestationrepsukblog.co.uk/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Police Station Reps Blog", "title": "Police Station rep", "title_full": "Police Station rep", "published": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "620903e107093333a0a92bafd356da429ebdf5d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.eS2ELS3ZJxtNHA0.k8wGU9P.eDRAvgJLyn3M3YNdnHgQM0C4g56u1EigR.QPczhAV1SU8_.fsqicS4q0VkNTR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Robert Cashman (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "Police Station rep", "text": "Police Station Rep \nPolice Station Agency Covering Kent, Essex & London.\nPolice Station Representatives Throughout England and Wales.\nHave you a police station that needs a police station rep?\nAre all your police station accredited reps/agents out of the office or covering other jobs?\n\nPolicestationagent.co.uk is a south-east based police station agency that provides accredited representatives to criminal practitioners, who need representation at the police station now.\n\n\n\n \n\nAll our representatives are extremely experienced and fully qualified.

Thankfully for us, we\u2019ve got the inside scoop. \nRidley recently had a chat with Boss Bomb Maude Garrett, who was conducting press interviews through HOYTS Australia, in which Maude asked the starlet what she could reveal about Rey in The Last Jedi . In true-to-herself cheeky fashion, Ridley kept it simple and gave a short statement she ended with a silly smile: \u201cRey\u2026 She has a lightsaber\u2026 that she swings.\u201d \nThough it\u2019s not much of a shock, since we already saw Rey wielding the powerful weapon in The Force Awakens and have caught plenty of glimpses of the character doing the same in The Last Jedi promotional materials, Ridley\u2019s remark here could hint at what Rey\u2019s journey in the forthcoming movie will be centered around. The fact that Ridley chose to focus on Rey\u2019s fighting skills affirms the previously known fact that her primary goal will be to become a strong Jedi under the tutelage of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), but it also seems to indicate that even when Rey isn\u2019t training with the master, she\u2019ll still be swinging her saber against the bad guys. \nAll things considered, it sounds like The Last Jedi will be more about action and battles than exploration and banter for Rey, and we can\u2019t say we mind the shift in focus. \nStar Wars: The Last Jedi zooms into theaters on December 15.

The Administrative Secretary of the Commission, Alhaji Muhammed Umar, disclosed this at a stakeholders meeting in Jalingo. According to him, over 26,000 of the PVCs have not been collected by their owners in Jalingo town alone. \nHe advised the affected persons to visit their respective Council Areas\u2019 secretariats and claim their PVCs. On the Ardo-Kola State Constituency bye election, Umar said the Commission\u2019s headquarters would soon announce the date for the election. Umar said the proposed Feb. 10, 2018 would be subject to the approval of INEC headquarters. The stakeholders had earlier in the meeting agreed on Feb. 10, 2018 as date for the bye election. The State PDP Chairman, Mr Victor Bala, had appealed to the commission to reschedule the election from mid Jan. to Feb. 10, 2018 as his party was pre occupied with preparations for its national convention. Mr Augustine Kunnini, the State\u2019s All Progressives Congress (APC) Treasurer, agreed with Bala\u2019s position, saying that the date would give the parties ample time to prepare for the election. The Speaker, Taraba House of Assembly, Mr Abel Diah, had on Nov. 20, declared vacant the seat occupied by late Abdulmalik Dame, the former member representing Ardo-Kola in the assembly. Dame died on Oct. 26 in Yola after a brief illness.

She had a way with food. Like me, she tended to use every dish and pot in the kitchen when cooking, unlike Sheila who can make a 5 course meal and put it on the table without leaving any sign she'd ever been cooking.

Adam Driver, who made his Star Wars debut in 2015\u2019s The Force Awakens , opened up about one of the best aspects of his role as Kylo Ren\u2013and it just might surprise you. \nDriver stated that the air of uncertainty and ambiguity surrounding Kylo, and the fact that certain details about his life won\u2019t ever be uncovered, is what makes his performance as the character so fun. \n\u201cThings that I knew were kind of operating in the first one [ The Force Awakens ], you know, that I feel that maybe won\u2019t even ever come out, or may come out in this movie [ The Last Jedi ], I think is a fun thing to play,\u201d the actor explained. \nDriver\u2019s comments here echo ones he has given to other outlets along the Last Jedi junket, as he also told another publication that a number of things about Kylo and his backstory will \u201cnever be revealed,\u201d which \u201cmakes it kind of more fun in the playing\u201d of him. \nBy the sounds of it, Star Wars fans may have to face the reality that Kylo Ren may forever be an enigma, though they can be certain that Driver will give the character his all, even in the midst of all the mystery. \nWritten and directed by Rian Johnson, Star Wars: The Last Jedi features a stacked cast including the likes of Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa, Daisy Ridley as Rey, John Boyega as Finn, Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke, Lupita Nyong\u2019o as Maz Kanata, Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux, Gwendoline Christie as Captain Phasma, newcomer Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico, Laura Dern as Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, and Benicio del Toro as \u201cDJ.\u201d Prince Harry and Prince William will make cameo appearances as well. \nCatch the film in cinemas on December 15, and be on the lookout for more exclusive Last Jedi coverage right here on Geek Bomb.

I had a few major points to convey:1. In spite of being an educated, articulate person, I did not find any process in place, to route my grievance through, when I found a lack of service in the hospital. I want other patients, too, or their representatives, whatever their level of literacy or awareness, to be given a concrete channel of grievance which is made clear to them at the time of their admission to the hospital.2. I want billing practices to be improved in the following ways: Operation Theatre (OT) consumables and charges itemized separately, with the patient having the ability to cross-check the items with the doctor/surgeon, in case of a dispute. Other consumables to be itemized on the bill, with the patitent (or the family or friends) being able to query them. Not every patient will need, or want, this facility, but it should be in place for those who need it.3.I took along a friend of mine, Tara Ollapally, who is a legal mediator, to ask the hospital to build a system whereby, in the event of a grievance or of lack of service by the hospital (whether administration, billing, or medical/nursing care) , the patient or the representative can have the option to have a legal mediator (a neutral third party) present in the meeting between the hospital and the patient, guiding both to a practical and pragmatic solution, rather than a path to our time- and money-consuming courts.Dr Manish and Nayna Pai both agreed to the points of view presented, and did mention that they would also want such practices embedded. Dr Manish mentioned how,often patients and their representatives threaten and do actually take physical action against doctors and hospitals. The idea is to reduce this culture of confrontation, where one party is aways jockeying for superiority with the bottom line being money, not the issues at hand.If I am given clear documentation in the near future, that Fortis Hospitals, Bannerghatta Road, has changed the billing system, with more clarity and transparency, and is working, long-term, towards making patients more aware of their rights in querying hospital practices, I will certainly change my present opinion of them, and be willing to agree that there is hope for positive change. As of now...my perception is that I don't want to ever enter a hospital... or a court of law....if I can help it!

(Photo by Patipat Janthong) - + The Board of Zoological Park Organisation will meet next Tuesday to consider if the 79-year-old Dusit Zoo should be relocated from its present site opposite the parliament in Bangkok. \nDeputy director-general Suriya Saengpong said on Thursday the meeting would set a clear direction for the zoo. He declined to comment on speculation it would be moved to adjoining Pathum Thani province, to the north. \nRecently, His Majesty the King gave about 300 rai of land in Pathum Thani to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment to build a new zoo and new offices for the Zoological Park Organisation, which is currently housed at Dusit Zoo. \nDusit was the first public zoo in Thailand, and is the best known. It opened to the public on March 18, 1938. \nThe zoo covers about 100 rai. It welcomes about 2 million visitors each year, collecting about 120 million baht in admission fees.

INFAMY", "text": "     December 7th. A date we still remember though it seems to be fading as the years go by. But we need to remember that day when our country was attacked and quite frankly, we came near to losing who and what we were as a result. We lost not only much of our fleet of battleships, but we also lost our heads and minds as we chased decent and loyal citizens and residents, accusing them without proof of infamy, of treachery planned and our American values were lost. \n     Lest one think that we have learned our lesson, I refer you to the third ban out of Trump's dictatorial and xenophobic mind and administration and I ask you - have we learned how to deal with infamy or are we still lost in hatred and mass accusations. \n     I will make no bones about it. I am not particularly fond of Arabs or Moslems. I see many things wrong in the attitudes that are taught by many of their imams. I think the religion has been hijacked and certainly, as a Jew supporting Israel and the rights of the Jewish people to have one little Jewish state, I have qualms about them. But! A big but. The concern and worry over some does not mean the worry and hatred for all. I have long spoken about the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, a Moslem group facing death. Right is right and hatred is hatred, especially hatred of the mass group without distinction. \n     That is what we now have coming out of the works of Trump's perverted and twisted mind and that of his administration. He has enabled haters, extremists, anti Semites, xenophobic critters to crawl out of the woodwork and sow more seeds of evil and disaster. This is infamy. No denying it. \n     When we talk casually of nuclear war, or hear the majority of the country reject the President in strong terms, turning down invitations to visit him, when Lindsey Vonn, a gold medalist in skiing says she is skating for America, the country and not its president, and that she will refuse a White House visit should she win again - here again is infamy. Not her actions, but those of the administration that have led her and us to this point. Infamy indeed. \n     While Pearl Harbor was ringed by fire and ash, by the deaths of thousands, today our infamy is not from without but from within. We have supposed patriots, or so they claim, who have allegedly sold our country downriver to Russia for financial gain and political advantage. We have a president whose financial dealings with Deutsche Bank are now under investigation and we now have the Republicans not supporting the investigation, not supporting wherever the truth will take us, but instead are trying to shut it down, shut down perfidy and wrong, ignore evil and immorality. \n     We have more present day infamy with the filthy and horrific entitlement behavior of men towards those in their power, towards those they can threaten and intimidate. But no longer! Time magazine has recognized the courage it takes to finally speak out, speak up and we must recognize that there is something lacking in our gestalt in America today and for decades. We have let personal greed overcome and overtake the benefits for the whole, the goodness that America, the word and the state implied. We have gone wrong, and are just as much under bombardment in a different way as was Pearl Harbor so many years ago. \n     We must ask ourselves if we are willing to allow this man and his henchmen to hijack us with deeds of infamy. So now we go to court to enforce bans of hatred. We use supposed law to justify rending families. And yet we do not ban Russians, those who allegedly colluded with the present administration from before election and afterwards, or do we now allow our enemies to be chosen by who will benefit us financially and who will not. Be sure that I have no wish to ban anyone other than the particular enemies we do have but it seems that we are careless with our branding today. \n     It behooves us to think and choose carefully. It seems that we are our worst enemies. We refuse to recognize how our former allies - be it France or England or Australia, etc. - are now in the process of rejecting us and our warped actions and dealings, with our degenerated 'leader'. \n    Infamy comes in different forms at different times.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File)( Gregory Bull , NJ Advance Media for NJ.com \nANAHEIM, Calif. -- The Anaheim Angels rolled out the red carpet for the Eagles , including by giving every player a Mike Trout bobblehead in their locker upon arrival into the palatial home clubhouse of Angel Stadium ahead of Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Rams . \nMany players were blown away by the accommodations. \n\"I'll tell you what,\" Eagles right tackle Lane Johnson said. \"This is pretty sweet. Baseball players have it made.\" \nLike most Major League Baseball clubhouses, the Angels' features several leather couches, mounted flat-screen TVs, and even a schedule on the wall that has a baseball glued to each date of an Angels' victory from the 2017 season. \nEagles vs. Rams key matchups \nHowever, several players said that actually practicing on the field that was converted from a baseball diamond to a gridiron took some getting used to. \n\"It took me about a period to get used to it,\" Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins said of the field conditions. \"It was a little slick. It's not every day that they put a football field in a baseball stadium.\" Eagles' 1st practice at Angel Stadium \nJohnson says that because of the different grass than the team is accustomed to practicing on at the NovaCare Complex, the Eagles' equipment staff flew out and distributed cleats with metal spikes. \nOverall, though, the Eagles came away impressed by the job done in concert between the Eagles' football operations staff, grounds crew and the Angels' organization. \n\"it's been pretty seamless,\" head coach Doug Pederson said at the team's hotel in Costa Mesa on Wednesday prior to practice. \"I've got to credit our IT staff, our video department, our training and medical staff, our equipment staff, and everybody that even came out to set the hotel up and set up Angels stadium. It's been seamless. [We're] Gracious for the Angels for allowing us to practice there, and our grounds crew have done an amazing job over there when you see it today, with putting some sod down in the infield and just a great job. It's been seamless. The transition's been really good. Offices are great. Players are really adjusting well. It feels like NovaCare.\" \nMatt Lombardo may be reached at MLombardo@njadvancemedia.com.

Companies are also making use of sea planes and corporate planes depending on the demand and patient location. \nLack of Infrastructure and Inadequate Number of Aircraft in Developing Regions are Key Challenges for Growth of Air Ambulance Market \nOn the basis of geography, the global air ambulance services market scenario can be segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Rest of the World. Developed infrastructure, defined regulatory framework and favorable reimbursement policies are some of the factors contributing to the dominance of the air ambulance services market in North America and Europe. Developing countries of Asia Pacific, Latina America and Middle East are expected to show swift growth in the demand for air ambulance services. Factors such as rapidly growing medical tourism, improving medical infrastructure, and increasing disposable income are projected to boost growth of air ambulance services market in these regions. Air ambulance service providers in India such as Aviators Air Rescue, Aeromed, Innovation Aviation Pvt Ltd, JetSetGo, Air Ambulance Aviation, and Medanta\u2019s Flying Doctors are collaborating with insurance providers to make the service affordable to all. However, lack of infrastructure and inadequate number of aircraft is deterring operators to meet demand for air ambulance in the country. \nAsk for customization: https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/request-customization/6 \nFaster Reach and Onboard Assistance Driving Demand \nSome key global air ambulance services market drivers include its ability to faster reach compared to road ambulance and onboard medical assistance. Also, air ambulance services are widely utilized on the warfront to rescue injured soldiers and provide emergency medical care to them. \nFavorable reimbursement policies for air ambulance services are propelling demand for air ambulance services among patients. Certain insurance providers in Canada reimburse around 80% of the total service cost of air ambulance. This reimbursement policy is applicable for patients who require immediate hospitalization. This policy, however, excludes non-emergency patients, thus increasing cost of this service for such patients. This is a major air ambulance services market restraint. Formulation of strict safety rules by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is one of the factors anticipated to reduce profit margins of air ambulance service providers, which would also hinder the growth of air ambulance services market revenue during the forecast period (2016\u20132024). \nAmbulance Drones: A Fast Emerging Possible Nemesis \nAir ambulance service is a capital intensive business, which increases entry barriers for new entrants in the market. Moreover, the advent of ambulance drones will also impact demand for air ambulance in future. The high cost of availing the air ambulance service in comparison to a cheaper ambulance drone would be restrain market growth of air ambulance to a major extent. \nClick here to know more about this report: https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/ongoing-insight/air-ambulance-services-market-6 \nIn terms of number of players, there are various small players operating with a small fleet of planes across the globe.

So what is exactly could a person actually \u201cfalling away\u201d from? The scripture says two things: heart of unbelief in God\u2019s Word and departing from the living God. \nWhy is it important to know this word, \u201cApostasy?\u201d The note came from Zondervan, The Full Life Study Bible and we could learn a lot from this study. This topic will help us to know what things that cause people to fall away from God.\n\nI have seen the word, \u2018Apostasy\u2019 from the TV, the history channel and TBN [Trinity Broadcasting Network] and I had wondered why they talked about it. When I asked the Lord what He wants me to put on Fresh Manna for the beginning of Feb. 2009. He gave me three words: The Falling Away. \nThe Lord wants us to know His word and stay close to Him. Studying the title, \u201cThe Apostasy, the Falling Away\u201d might save many Christians if they know what is happening around us and what to watch out for. \n\nThe Bible says \u201cThe heart is deceitful above all things, who can know it\u201d came from Jeremiah 17:9. We need to guide our heart into the Word of God so our hearts will not deceive us. Those are words of encouragement that will keep us in union with Christ. \nPaul wrote in Hebrews 3:13-15 \u201cBut encourage each other every day while it is \u201ctoday.\u201d Help each other so none of you will become hardened because sin has tricked you.

The state is going to the first phase of polls this Saturday, the outcome of which is scheduled on December 18.

In another news, as per an article in Business Standard , the department of investment and public asset management (DIPAM) is looking to not only to achieve FY18 divestment target, but also aiming to take disinvestment proceeds beyond Rs 900 billion.

Note that with the fiscal deficit widening , the government is aiming at higher revenue from divestments. The disinvestment target for FY18 is Rs 725 billion. This is the highest target set so far for any year. The government has already collected Rs 523.9 billion so far higher than previous year collection of Rs 455 billion. This is evident in the chart below: \nHigher Revenue from Disinvestment? (Click on image to enlarge) It will be interesting to see how the government approaches disinvestment in the coming months.

(Reuters photo) - + SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia: Between Sihanoukville's beaches and its multiplying casinos, \"Lao Qi\" and Bun Saroeun run restaurants barely a hundred dusty metres apart. But their fortunes could not be more different. \nFor while Lao Qi is riding the Chinese boom that brought him and thousands of others from China to the Cambodian resort, Bun Saroeun's business was built on low-budget Western visitors. It is far less profitable and now he faces eviction. \nSihanoukville starkly illustrates how Cambodia's ever tightening relationship with China is transforming the country. Just as China's aid and investment have helped Prime Minister Hun Sen defy Western criticism of a crackdown on his opponents, they are also binding Cambodia's economy ever more closely to China's. \nSihanoukville, which has Cambodia's only deep-water port, was carved out of the jungle in the 1960s and named after former King Norodom Sihanouk. Once a playground for Cambodia's elite, it fell on hard times during the Khmer Rouge genocide and conflicts of the 1970s and 1980s before becoming a stop for backpackers and other Westerners looking for sun, sea, sand and - for some - sex. \nBut a steady trickle of Chinese money into its casinos has now swelled to a tide that promises to remodel a city touted by developers as the first port of call on China's \"Belt and Road\". \n\"This is like China 20 years ago. The opportunity is huge,\" said Lao Qi, 33, who goes by his nickname and first moved here from China's Zhejiang province to work in a casino. His noodles and fried rice can now make him hundreds of dollars a day. \nLao Qi, poses in front of the menu at his Chinese restaurant in Preah Sihanoukville province, Cambodia Nov 27, 2017. (Reuters photo) \nDown the road at the Ecstatic Pizza restaurant, 59-year-old Bun Saroeun counts himself lucky to make over $100 a day. Rising hotel prices and the noise of construction are discouraging Western visitors and Cambodian tourists from the city, he says. \n\"A few Chinese came here but now they have their own restaurants,\" said Bun Saroeun, whose landlord is now evicting him to redevelop the prime property near the Occhuteal Beach. \nThe Chinese influx is very much by design. In charge of the city is governor Yun Min, the former regional military commander and a close ally of Hun Sen. He made trips to China himself to encourage investors and offer them protection. \n\"We want more of them to come,\" he told Reuters, estimating that Chinese already rent half the property in the city. \"We benefit from them.\" \n'MACAU TWO' \nEstimates for the numbers of Chinese now resident in the city of 250,000 run from the thousands to the tens of thousands, but no figures are made public. \nAcross Sihanoukville, Mandarin signs are proliferating. Supermarkets packed with Chinese goods are commonplace - the only Cambodian items tend to be beer and bottled water. \nYet the current Chinese influx into Sihanoukville is nothing compared to what is forecast. Near the once tranquil Independence Beach, concrete towers have sprouted in months, promising casinos, hotels and thousands of apartments. \n\"This is Macau Two,\" boasts Chen Hu, the 48-year-old general manager at the $200 million 38-storey Blue Bay Resort development, comparing the city to the world's biggest gambling centre. \nAt his showroom, groups of prospective condominium buyers from China admire the model. About 20% of at least 700 apartments have already been sold, he says. Prices range from around $125,000 to $500,000. \n\"A lot of people complain, but a lot of people also benefit from the injection of money from China,\u201d said William Van, 60, who owns an apartment block now filled largely with Chinese workers and has seen the value of his investment soar. \nA clear attraction for all Chinese investors, developers say, has been the close Cambodia-China relationship - strengthened by Hun Sen's repeated trips to Beijing and Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Phnom Penh late last year. \nOn his latest trip to Beijing last week, Hun Sen won offers of investment of $7 billion from Chinese companies in a highway, a satellite city near Phnom Penh, and projects in education, entertainment and banking. It was unclear how new or firm the promises were, but they highlight the accelerating investment trend. \nA Chinese hotel and entertainment complex under construction is seen in Preah Sihanoukville province, Cambodia Nov 26, 2017. (Reuters photo) \nBusiness is following the flag China has planted in Cambodia. \n\u201cIt\u2019s continuing and may even be exploding,\u201d said US based academic Sophal Ear, co-author of a book on China\u2019s quest for resources abroad. \u201cWe are talking orders of magnitude now beyond what anyone else is doing...They\u2019re crowding out other investors with the sheer volume and scale of their activities.\u201d \nPictures of Xi and Hun Sen feature prominently in one of the glossy handouts from the Prince Real Estate Group as it markets apartments in Phnom Penh and now starts work on two projects costing $1 billion in Sihanoukville. \n\"It is a core location of the Belt and Road initiative,\" said marketing director Hu Tian Lu, referring to China\u2019s infrastructure-led development and diplomatic initiative. \nA short drive from the port is an expanding Special Economic Zone, where 90% of the 110 companies now operating there are Chinese, enjoying tax-free imports and exports and corporate tax holidays. \nChina is due to build a four-lane highway to Phnom Penh, the international airport in Sihanoukville is being expanded - some 70% of international flights are already to Chinese destinations - and improved rail links are eventually planned under the Belt and Road programme. \nMORE CHINESE TOURISTS \nAlthough Sihanoukville is a focal point for Chinese investment, the phenomenon is far from localised. \nMore tourists to Cambodia come from China than any other nation - 635,000 in the first seven months of the year, or a fifth of the total. Cambodia hopes to draw two million Chinese tourists a year by 2020. \nChinese investment over the 2012-16 period was over $4 billion - more than 30 times that from the United States, even including a $100 million Coca-Cola plant which opened last year. China's $265 million in aid last year was well over twice that of Japan's and nearly four times that from the United States. \nChinese dams provide most of Cambodia's electricity; a third of the garment factories that produce Cambodia's main export are Chinese. \nNearly half of Cambodia's $5.8 billion foreign debt is also owed to China - many multiples what it owes any other country. \nThe government's political debt to Beijing has also grown. \nAs Western countries have condemned the arrest of Hun Sen's main rival and the dissolution of his party ahead of next year's election, China has voiced support for Cambodia's efforts to keep order. \nFrom Cambodia, China can count on its loyal support on regional issues, while it also gains a strategic foothold deep in Southeast Asia. Sandwiching Sihanoukville are concessions owned by Chinese companies that give them control of well over one-third of Cambodia's coastline. \nThe gush of money into Sihanoukville has meant a bonanza for land owners: one hotelier told how the Chinese turned up with an offer of twice what he was making to take his hotel over for casino staff. He no longer needs to work. \nFor anyone renting, it is a nightmare. Long term Western expatriates talk of being \"Chinesed\" - being turfed out because a Chinese customer has turned up willing to pay much more. \nReal estate agent Thim Sothea got a harsh lesson in the way the market was trending when his landlord evicted his business, Sihanoukville Property, from a spot near the beach so a Chinese company could move in at double the rent. \n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming Chinatown here,\u201d he said at a meeting at a cafe because he is still looking for a new space. \u201cThat\u2019s fine for the rich who own hotels and property, not for everyone else.\u201d \nIt also suits Lao Qi just fine. He already has plans to open a new restaurant, which he expects will be closer to the beach.
