\"cloud-focused\" smartphone manufacturers such as Google or Apple leading the pack. However, at least Samsung users can stop worrying about a lack of expandable storage in the near future, because the built-in storage in their devices should soon be large enough to never need a microSD card in the first place. \nThe Korean electronics giant has officially started mass production of the world's first 512GB embedded Universal Flash Storage (eUFS). This means Samsung's 2018 flagship smartphones may have double the storage of this year's equivalents. \nUsers will be able to store up to 130 10-minute video clips at UHD resolution on these new chips, and read & write speeds have been improved as well, reaching 860MB per second and 255MB per second respectively. That is fast enough to transfer a 5GB video clip to an SSD in around six seconds. It is also eight times faster than a standard microSD card, making the internal storage solution much more suitable to anyone who requires fast data transfer. \nSamsung says it is planning to steadily increase production volume to meet increasing demand for its high-capacity mobile storage, so hopefully we'll see the big chips coming to other manufacturers very soon as well.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "digital photography review", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:31.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "31cb9186c3242256d348994b8a0cd3317894dfa5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRlC6L2XJZCIj5B152kwWH8QLxo2P57EhAuPgW9Y0TsVmpXD.x0j3f6MMiA7cz2.E1r.xwNKAaxznjStQj_SE37.bkNpkdnJXZqclILeiqZiMJtXvqatsBTmh3bU.M2qnQ-", "site_full": "www.chevyhhr.net", "site": "chevyhhr.net", "site_section": "https://www.chevyhhr.net/forums/hhr-ss-45/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "HHR SS - Chevy HHR Network", "title": "testing back in 2002 that was the ground-work for our 2.0 turbo LNF", "title_full": "testing back in 2002 that was the ground-work for our 2.0 turbo LNF - Chevy HHR Network", "published": "2017-12-05T03:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "69dcd558e0126c0935837a816ba885ca77cf4394", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRlC6L2XJZCIj5B152kwWH8QLxo2P57EhAuPgW9Y0TsVmpXD.x0j3f6MMiA7cz2.E1r.xwNKAaxznjStQj_SE37.bkNpkdnJXZqclILeiqZiMJtXvqatsBTVWSEalUMeDf3q11D.ZVlXA--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "2005HHRauto", "published": "2017-12-05T04:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The GM team decided the head was flexing. Returning to a stock-deck Ecotec block, they switched to high-strength H11 head studs. This restricted the head gasket leakage and failure exclusively to outboard sections of the fire ring at either end of the head on cylinders one and four. The GM team solved this problem by reinforcing the two problem areas with twin studs that threaded through bores machined into the upper structure of the head and jammed against the outboard fire-ring areas of the head next to cylinders one and four.\nThe engine now happily made 500 hp-and ran smack into the outer limits of stock coil-on-plug performance. Integral microprocessors will not allow the stock coils to energize and fire in the presence of excessive voltage. Short-term solution: GMR converted to a cam-driven distributor ignition with industrial-strength super coil.\nUnfortunately, as power climbed toward 600, the entire block-head interface began leaking from the extreme combustion pressures. The GM team pressed stainless O-rings into machined grooves in the head, machined receiver grooves in the block and installed a soft copper head gasket. Problem solved.\nAt 600 hp, the extreme power and high engine speeds began distorting and flexing the aftermarket super-duty 4350 wrist pins. Left unattended, this would eventually tear out the pin towers below the wrist pins. In this same power range, the Ecotec's ring packs began failing. GM Racing opened the wrist-pin bores in the pistons by .003-inch and installed thicker H11 wrist pins with thicker walls. The team simultaneously migrated from the 1.0- x 1.0- x 3.0-inch aftermarket rings to Total Seal 1.5- x 1.5- x 4.0-inch ring packs.\nThe Ecotec was now finally reliable to 650 hp at 19 psi of boost-a relatively low level of boost, indicating outstanding volumetric efficiency. The GM team verified acceptable stress on all parts and lowered oil pressure to 85 psi after concluding that higher pump settings simply robbed horsepower and excessively aerated the oil.\nThe Push for 800 Horsepower\nConsider this: 800 hp is a lot. On a 122 cubic-inch motor with 750 hp-three-quarters of a thousand-you're basically dealing with 6.14 hp per cubic inch. Pressures and stresses of all kinds-thermal and mechanical loading across the board-escalate to extreme levels. A Chevrolet 5.7-liter LS1 V8 with this much specific power (horsepower per cubic inch) would be making 2,137 hp.\nGM Racing encountered a whole new world of problems between 650 and 800 hp on the Ecotec. Ring packs that worked fine at 650 hp failed to seal with acceptable blow-by as power approached 700. Pistons scuffed on cylinders, rod bearings began to go away. The ability to fire plugs through a 6 hp-per-cube mixture density required a radically powerful spark. Anti-detonation countermeasures of the highest order became crucial. GM Racing milled down the Ecotec plug bosses to accommodate a range of plug heat ranges.\nThe super-modified Ecotec was able to achieve a reliable 750 hp on 24 psi of boost at 9000 rpm with 10:1 compression and an unspecified fuel with extremely high octane and excellent heat of vaporization characteristics. But as Bothwell's team pushed power beyond the 750-plus range, GM Racing began to encounter such extreme cylinder pressures and thermal expansion that the thin-wall stock cylinder sleeves and support structure began to warp and go out of round, split. Cylinder-piston scuffing became a problem.\nAs of this writing, the team has developed a promising new \"Super-Turbo\" Ecotec, built in a process where a GMR machinist entirely removes the stock sleeves and aluminum cylinder support structure/core, pressing thick, custom-built bottom-flanged steel sleeves into receiver bores machined directly into the floor of the water jacket. GMR reinforces the new extra-thick full-floating sleeves with a pool of epoxy that effectively raises the floor of the water jacket to surround the base of the cylinders. As an anti-scuff countermeasure, GM Racing increased the cylinder bore clearance in the Super-Turbo engine by 0.001-inch, and shot-peened the piston skirts to help retain oil.\nAnalysis\nIt's amazing that any components whatsoever designed for a stock 140-hp 2.2-liter Ecotec would survive on an extreme powerplant making more than six times the power. However, the stock Ecotec block and main/girdle structure did survive to 750 hp, as did the stock sleeves. The stock main bearings survived. The stock stamped roller finger-followers were effective to at least 9700 rpm, as were the hydraulic lifters. The oil delivery passages remained stock to 800 hp. The stock chains, guides, tensioners and water pump worked well all the way to heaven. The stock head survived with minor strengthening and massive breathing modifications. Many other components were good for two to four times stock power (see chart). GM Powertrain engineers designed a base engine with many stock components that were above and beyond what was needed for stock performance. \"The crank support structure of the Ecotec is unbelievably strong,\" says Bothwell. \"We detected no core shifting under the most extreme conditions.\"\nThe engine-fuel combination turned out to be extremely knock-resistant. The Ecotec combustion chamber is efficient, with excellent tumble and high flame speed, and the engine was able to run 10:1 compression without knock at boost pressures as high as 36 psi at 21 degrees spark advance. In a vehicle, the on-board computer is aware of which gear is in use and varies maximum boost accordingly to avoid detonation and traction problems.\nFrom the excellent power-boost ratio of 750 hp at 24 psi, one can infer that careful turbo selection, camshaft selection and timing, good intercooling and carefully considered turbo system geometry result in a happy situation in which inlet manifold pressure exceeds backpressure in a happy phenomenon called crossover, where horsepower really skyrockets.\nTurbo configuration and size would change three times during the tuning process. The highest-flow turbo is currently capable of delivering 40 psi boost at very high power levels. The largest Innovative wastegate is unable to divert enough exhaust to keep boost from creeping to a minimum of 15 psi when heavily loaded on the dyno, though this is not a problem on the track.\nWhat is the Ecotec's final frontier? So far, unknown; but we'll be looking to the track in 2002 for the answers to that question.\nEcotec Building Blocks\nThe Ecotec's outstanding feature to performance enthusiasts will undoubtedly be its impressive strength. GM Racing dyno tests confirm an otherwise bone-stock Ecotec is capable of a reliable 350 hp with forged rods and pistons (and a bunch of nitrous or boost). Add a billet crank, minor head reinforcing, and cylinder O-rings, and breathed-on turbo Ecotecs will live to race many times at 650 hp. Re-sleeve the block and 800-1,000 usable horsepower appears feasible with the right fuel.\nThe lightweight, low-friction Ecotec powerplant is built around a strong and compact 86mm-bore block manufactured with the lost-foam casting technique (they pack sulfur casting sand around Styrofoam molds shellacked with ceramic, then inject molten aluminum into the foam, which is vaporized into recoverable gas as the metal replaces it.) Flanged, thin-wall iron cylinder sleeves press-fit into a semi-floating aluminum support structure/core. The Ecotec block is supported by a massive die-cast aluminum girdle/main cap assembly and structural oil pan designed to impart rigidity for improved longevity and low noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH). The main-cap structures are each supported with six fasteners. Extra-thick main bearings resist the differential thermal expansion of the nodular-iron aerodynamic crank and aluminum block.\nGM casts all Ecotec blocks with passages for piston-cooling jets and an oil cooler usable for potential high-output turbocharged applications. The fully-boxed block requires no windage tray, even on GM Racing 650+hp drag motors. An auxiliary chain drives the water pump and optional balance shafts from the crank.\nTo avoid potential hot spots, pressure-cast non-squish dished 9.5:1 pistons negate the need for any valve pockets; for high compression applications, flat-topping the pistons produces a 10:1 compression ratio. The top ring is a symmetrical, barrel-faced moly-coated design that fits in an anodized groove below a super-thin 3mm top ring land for low crevasse volume and reduced emissions. The pistons deliver power through full-floating pins and powder-metal or forged connecting rods.\nGM designed the twin-cam head for low-friction hydraulic roller finger-followers, proven effective and reliable to 9,500 rpm in GM Racing's Ecotec drag engine program. Head fastener placement permits cylinder head R&R without cam removal. The cams are driven directly off the crank by a chain, with the design protected for possible future variable cam phasing. The finger-follower design permits a lightweight narrow profile and reduced valve angles of 18 and 16 degrees.

But that was then.\"\nBothwell began by scoping out what sort of power and torque would be required to get people's attention in the \"FWD Performance\" world, and followed up on that with a crash program to push the envelope of an Ecotec. Hard.\nThe GM Racing team set about to find the limits of an Ecotec the old fashioned way-by progressively blowing more nitrous through it on an engine dyno until something broke. Then repairing the engine with stronger parts (sending any damaged parts to a lab for forensic analysis), and pushing on until the next weakest link died and went to Hell. And so on.\nQuest for Failure: Nitrous\nWith this in mind, GM Racing bolted a factory-stock Ecotec to an engine dyno and wired up a DFI/Accel programmable engine management system to control it via a data link connected to a laptop computer with Windows-based graphical user interface.\nThe team then constructed a custom three-stage nitrous system designed to spray a cold fog of nitrous into the Ecotec at a single point near the throttle body, delivering additional fuel to match the oxygen-enriched air via increased pulsewidth from the stock electronic fuel injectors.\nGM Racing began the tuning process on a Heinen-Freud water-brake dyno using the stock intake and exhaust manifolds and a modified stock down-pipe plumbed without muffler or cat directly into the dyno cell's exhaust removal system. It turns out a well-tuned stock 10:1 2.2-liter Ecotec in the above configuration actually develops 168 crankshaft hp (which is above the factory rating of 140-150 as installed in various vehicles in the United States and Europe).\nAt this point, the team began to pump up the volume in a rigorous series of tests while a crew stood by with fire extinguishers. Testing at a given power level concluded when the engine could survive a series of 8-10 full-power dyno \"Sprints\" from peak torque through maximum power in 50 rpm steps, concluding with at least six seconds at full power, for a total of at least 20 very hard seconds. GM Racing successively verified that the Ecotec survived happily at 200, 225 and 250 hp over numerous dyno pulls.\nHowever, as the Ecotec pushed through 283 hp at 4400 rpm, all four connecting rods simultaneously failed catastrophically and smashed through the side of the block. Laboratory analysis subsequently revealed a mid-beam compression fracture on all four stock powder-metal rods. All other components checked out fine. GM Racing installed a package of components you'd certainly install if you were taking the trouble to open an engine to upgrade the connecting rods: Super-duty forged Crower X-beam rods-plus 10:1 JE forged pistons with thicker top ring lands and Hastings moly ring packs. The GM Racing team installed larger fuel injectors, and continued to lean on the engine. Power advanced quickly to 350 hp, at which point the engine ran out of breathing room on the exhaust side. The ratio of Reactants (exhaust) to Products (inlet charge) is very high on a nitrous motor. GM Racing found the stock Ecotec exhaust manifold became sufficiently restrictive above 350-hp that injudiciously adding more nitrous could actually make less horsepower-due to dramatically decreased efficiencies in scavenging exhaust gases from the combustion chamber clearance volume. \"We finally made 370-375 hp on nitrous,\" says Bothwell, \"but the engine was really pissed off.\"\nBuilding the Turbo Ecotec\nAt this point, GM Racing abandoned nitrous, built an efficient turbo Ecotec, and pushed on with the business of making power. The strategy was, make it efficient from Day One, then turn up the revs and boost. Bothwell's goal: 10,000 rpm and 800 hp.\n\"We knew the stock crank would need replacing by 500 hp,\" says Bothwell. \"Since we were going to need the rev capability, breathing and rod-stroke ratio of a square bore-stroke engine, we had Crower build a de-stroked forged billet 2.0-liter crankshaft and used it immediately from 350-hp.\" New, larger 4143 7/16-inch main studs replaced the head bolts to hold the new crank firmly in place.\nThe GM Team designed a tube-type stainless header fabricated to optimize the collection of exhaust pulses in the correct order to minimize collisions. With plenty of boost, the GM team knew the stock scroll-type plastic intake manifold could flow sufficient air for 500 hp. Since the goal was way beyond 500 hp, they fabricated an aluminum, straight-port dry intake manifold with high-volume plenum for the turbo Ecotec. To regulate big air flow, GM Racing pilfered the throttle body from an LS1 V8.\nGM Racing designed the turbo system around an advanced Innovative Turbo turbocharger with plenty of parts available to upgrade and tweak performance as required, plus a huge wastegate and pulse-modulated electronic controller. The GM team fabricated a gigantic custom air-water intercooler that could be cooled continuously on the dyno with tap water or with a dry-ice heat-sink at the track.\nGM Racing subcontractor Shaver Specialties dramatically upgraded the Ecotec head with significant porting and maximum size lightweight stainless-steel valves. Current SS flow-bench data shows the ported head capable of flowing 272 cfm intake air at 0.450 lift and 175-207 cfm exhaust.\nWith valve seals removed to prevent high-lift collisions with the retainers, Crower cams provide total intake lift and duration of .46482 inches and 221.4 degrees duration, total exhaust lift and duration of .46737 inches and 221.3 degrees. Shaver employed a proprietary GM Racing solution to forestall valve float problems at high-rpm and boost (with an eventual goal of 10,000 rpm redline, GM Racing decided to delete the Ecotec balance shafts).\nBy this time, the Turbo Ecotec powerplant had grown significantly in width. The GM Team decided to rotate it forward by 33 degrees. This would help deal with multi-G effects on oil drain-back and dramatically reduce the difficulty of packing it in a racecar.\nGM Racing converted the turbo Ecotec to a multi-stage dry-sump oil system designed to reduce crankcase windage and thus increase power by scavenging oil and crankcase gases directly from the cylinder head and oil pan into a high-volume external tank. From the tank, a separate pump stage would provide superior low-temperate, high-pressure lubrication with reduced aeration directly to the short block, head and turbocharger.\nThe GM team built a narrow, low-volume, forward-biased V-shaped oil pan that funneled return oil to dual dry-sump scavenge pickups. They opened up windows in the girdle of the \"Slant-Four\" to prevent oil from puddling at a relocated low point and killing horsepower by interfering with the crank at high rpm.\nQuest for Failure: Boost\nThe new turbo Ecotec immediately cranked out 350 hp at 7000 rpm on 2 psi boost, and rapidly closed in on 450 hp with zero failures. \"Our tuning strategy,\" says Bothwell. \"Was to start rich with a computer-generated air-fuel map and sneak up on rich-best torque.\"\nThe new turbo Ecotec was definitely responsive: GM Racing set idle at 1800 rpm, and if you punched it quick, the unloaded engine would blow completely through the 10K rev-limiter in less than a tenth of a second. The team expected an Ecotec-powered drag car to launch at 8000 rpm and run all the way through the gears in the quarter mile, so they cared mainly about the 5-10K rpm range. In this range, GM Racing wanted the turbocharger to achieve any specified level of \"full boost\" nearly 100-percent of the time.\nAs testing continued, GM Racing monitored EGT and exhaust gas oxygen on all four cylinders. Full-power target EGT was 1,230-degrees F, and would never exceed 1,350-degrees. The team continuously logged all sensor and actuator data throughout the power quest. The routine was, run the dyno manually at an array of \"breakpoints\" of speed, loading and boost, holding the engine steady at each point to tweak various parameters that define optimal rich/best torque-using EGT and wide-range O2 data, fuel-rail pressure, torque and power read-outs, a remote-control electronic boost controller and a laptop computer to recalibrate injection pulsewidth and spark advance.\nThroughout turbo Ecotec dyno testing, GM Racing chilled the air-water intercooler with fresh tap water. At high levels of boost, pressurized air would enter the cooler at 200 degrees, leave at 105-110 degrees, with some creep due to packaging compromises and negligible pressure-drop. At the track, a dry ice heat-sink would reduce intake air exiting the cooler to 60-70 degrees.\nAt 450 hp and 8 psi boost, the GM team began blowing head gaskets. One theory was that core-shifting in the block was causing the gasket to fail (because some Honda motors have this problem). \"I didn't buy it,\" says Bothwell. \"But we tried converting the Ecotec block to a solid deck. This, unfortunately, just wasted time and destroyed some blocks, probably due to thermal-expansion issues.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.superstreetonline.com/how-to/engine/turp-0203-gm-racing-ecotec-engine/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:31.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0e6d0e749c3b81d7eea450ed8e0a228a0c5f225", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpfucPosTv0XnrNyMNjy_dXEzrxOPeQSAg8jBsKsW7yJbgNm_LRCVfI_mWP8MV4PjY2TkeS_7xLJ5Ic6BWts6rUlIzv7zWyaYCMXRxgFM4zNQ--", "site_full": "trifidresearchwebinar.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://trifidresearchwebinar.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Trifid Research Webinar", "title": "Useful Currency Trading Tips", "title_full": "Useful Currency Trading Tips", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f0e6d0e749c3b81d7eea450ed8e0a228a0c5f225", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpfucPosTv0XnrNyMNjy_dXEzrxOPeQSAg8jBsKsW7yJbgNm_LRCVfI_mWP8MV4PjY2TkeS_7xLJ5Ic6BWts6rUlIzv7zWyaYCMXRxgFM4zNQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "arpit kumar bhawsar (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "Useful Currency Trading Tips", "text": "Useful Currency Trading Tips ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:31.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6adfee5d40901409914b9daebb7b9cc33d40b885", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApuZp1UWpgI14JZexDIlXQaeVL7SgNb4wkDLNSc6FPPcItmGLRc8FswX1fY0psECjFAsJL4SKlwr3mmYcrupjb1WvMI6WPEHZ92cjdLhkMPOlg--", "site_full": "medsfakianakis.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://medsfakianakis.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Medicine by Sfakianakis Alexandros", "title": "IJMS, Vol. 18, Pages 2647: Anti-Diabetic Effect of Organo-Chalcogen (Sulfur and Selenium) Zinc Complexes with Hydroxy-Pyrone Derivatives on Leptin-Deficient Type 2 Diabetes Model ob/ob Mice", "title_full": "IJMS, Vol. 18, Pages 2647: Anti-Diabetic Effect of Organo-Chalcogen (Sulfur and Selenium) Zinc Complexes with Hydroxy-Pyrone Derivatives on Leptin-Deficient Type 2 Diabetes Model ob/ob Mice", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6adfee5d40901409914b9daebb7b9cc33d40b885", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApuZp1UWpgI14JZexDIlXQaeVL7SgNb4wkDLNSc6FPPcItmGLRc8FswX1fY0psECjFAsJL4SKlwr3mmYcrupjb1WvMI6WPEHZ92cjdLhkMPOlg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alexandros Sfakianakis (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "IJMS, Vol. 18, Pages 2647: Anti-Diabetic Effect of Organo-Chalcogen (Sulfur and Selenium) Zinc Complexes with Hydroxy-Pyrone Derivatives on Leptin-Deficient Type 2 Diabetes Model ob/ob Mice", "text": "IJMS, Vol. 18, Pages 2647: Anti-Diabetic Effect of Organo-Chalcogen (Sulfur and Selenium) Zinc Complexes with Hydroxy-Pyrone Derivatives on Leptin-Deficient Type 2 Diabetes Model ob/ob Mice \nInternational Journal of Molecular Sciences doi: 10.3390/ijms18122647 \nAuthors: Takayuki Nishiguchi Yutaka Yoshikawa Hiroyuki Yasui\nSince the discovery of the anti-diabetic effects of zinc (Zn) complex, we synthesized several Zn complexes and evaluated their effects using the KKAy type 2 diabetes mouse model. Recently, we demonstrated that organo-chalcogen (sulfur and selenium) Zn complexes elicit strong anti-diabetic effects. In this study, we treated leptin-deficient ob/ob mice with organo-chalcogen Zn complexes, and evaluated the resulting anti-diabetic effects in a mouse model of diabetes arising from pathogenic mechanisms different from those in KKAy mice. C57BL/6J ob/ob mice orally received either bis(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4(H)-pyran-4-thiono)Zn, [Zn(hmpt)2] or bis(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4(H)-pyran-4-seleno)Zn, [Zn(hmps)2], daily for 28 days. Both Zn complexes elicited potent blood glucose-lowering effects and improved HbA1c values. Moreover, glucose intolerance improved as evidenced by the oral glucose tolerance test, and fasting plasma insulin levels decreased in both types of Zn complex-treated mice. Zn concentrations in the liver and pancreas of [Zn(hmpt)2]-treated mice and in the pancreas of [Zn(hmps)2]-treated mice were increased, respectively. The results suggest that the present Zn complexes mainly exerted an anti-diabetic effect in the liver or pancreas. This study is the first to demonstrate that potent Zn complexes elicit anti-diabetic effects in not only KKAy but also ob/ob mice via a normalizing effect on insulin secretion and fasting blood glucose levels.\n\n\nfrom #MedicinebyAlexandrosSfakianakis via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/2iYIkbC\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "takayuki nishiguchi yutaka yoshikawa hiroyuki yasui", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:31.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "31cb9186c3242256d348994b8a0cd3317894dfa5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRlC6L2XJZCIj5B152kwWH8QLxo2P57EhAuPgW9Y0TsVmpXD.x0j3f6MMiA7cz2.E1r.xwNKAaxznjStQj_SE37.bkNpkdnJXZqclILeiqZiMJtXvqatsBTmh3bU.M2qnQ-", "site_full": "www.chevyhhr.net", "site": "chevyhhr.net", "site_section": "https://www.chevyhhr.net/forums/hhr-ss-45/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "HHR SS - Chevy HHR Network", "title": "testing back in 2002 that was the ground-work for our 2.0 turbo LNF", "title_full": "testing back in 2002 that was the ground-work for our 2.0 turbo LNF - Chevy HHR Network", "published": "2017-12-05T03:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9bc30229e337fc1c79e4fbd54cf437b15a01f0b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRlC6L2XJZCIj5B152kwWH8QLxo2P57EhAuPgW9Y0TsVmpXD.x0j3f6MMiA7cz2.E1r.xwNKAaxznjStQj_SE37.bkNpkdnJXZqclILeiqZiMJtXvqatsBTVWSEalUMeDeMF4kbT9NcVw--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "RJ_RS_SS_350", "published": "2017-12-05T05:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Interesting, I eagerly await the next episode!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:31.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "31cb9186c3242256d348994b8a0cd3317894dfa5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRlC6L2XJZCIj5B152kwWH8QLxo2P57EhAuPgW9Y0TsVmpXD.x0j3f6MMiA7cz2.E1r.xwNKAaxznjStQj_SE37.bkNpkdnJXZqclILeiqZiMJtXvqatsBTmh3bU.M2qnQ-", "site_full": "www.chevyhhr.net", "site": "chevyhhr.net", "site_section": "https://www.chevyhhr.net/forums/hhr-ss-45/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "HHR SS - Chevy HHR Network", "title": "testing back in 2002 that was the ground-work for our 2.0 turbo LNF", "title_full": "testing back in 2002 that was the ground-work for our 2.0 turbo LNF - Chevy HHR Network", "published": "2017-12-05T03:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e0b4fd5a19a8cae3d0a42e5c0e1ba70768319817", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRlC6L2XJZCIj5B152kwWH8QLxo2P57EhAuPgW9Y0TsVmpXD.x0j3f6MMiA7cz2.E1r.xwNKAaxznjStQj_SE37.bkNpkdnJXZqclILeiqZiMJtXvqatsBTVWSEalUMeDeo46HupWPRlA--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "whopper", "published": "2017-12-05T05:51:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Great read.

Prosecutors say he accepted a $2 million bribe from Rosneft\u2019s influential CEO, Igor Sechin, for giving the company the green light for privatizing another oil firm. \nThe circumstances of the case have ignited speculation that Ulyukayev was caught in a Kremlin power play against Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin. \nIn his final argument on Thursday, Ulyukayev pleaded not guilty and accused Sechin of setting him up. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \n\u201cA horrific and cruel provocation has been perpetrated against me,\u201d he said in comments carried by Russian news agencies. \nSechin, whose testimony was the cornerstone of the case against the former minister, was summoned to testify in court four times but he did not show up, citing urgent matters of business. \nReferring to a common perception of Sechin as a dark force in Russian politics, Ulyakayev said in court on Thursday that the key witness \u201cdisappeared \u2014 what was left was a whiff of sulfur in the air.\u201d \nUlyukaev went to Sechin\u2019s office in November last year to discuss Rosneft\u2019s affairs, and was arrested as he was leaving the building with a bag full of cash that Sechin had given him. Ulyukayev told the court that he thought the bag contained a bottle of wine and a basket filled with sausages. \nIn wire tapes played out to the court earlier in the trial, Sechin was heard telling Ulyukayev to take the bag with the sausage. Russian media has reported that Sechin has a tradition of gifting people baskets of sausages from his own butcher\u2019s shop. \nUlyukayev could face a lengthy prison term if found guilty. Prosecutors have asked the court to send him to a high-security prison for ten years, arguing that Ulyukayev\u2019s actions \u201care undermining the authority of the government.\u201d \nUlyukayev told the court on Thursday that he is not guilty of \u201cthose absurd accusations but guilty of a different thing: I often compromised. I was a hypocrite. I love taking gifts and giving gifts. When you\u2019re doing all right, you shamelessly turn your back on other people\u2019s misfortunes.\u201d \nUlyukayev asked for \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d forgiveness and pledged to devote rest of his life to \u201cdefending people\u2019s interests.\u201d \nThe court is expected to deliver the verdict next week.

Provincial funding is based on enrolment and therefore funding amounts can change in the fall when student numbers are solidified. \nThe division has been given an additional $1.262 million in CIF funding. The temporary funding was offered up during teachers\u0092 contract negotiations. \nIt must go to classroom initiatives and CIF spending has to be approved by the Province. \nMorrison said $600,000 in spending cuts were made across the division office during the spring budgeting process in professional development spending and some support staff were laid off or not replaced to make up for shortfalls. \nHowever, many of the cuts made in the regular budget were reinstated through Classroom Initiative Funding, Morrison said. \nOn Friday a committee of four CTR Catholic teachers and four administrative staff allocated half of the CIF funds across the division, which has 18 schools from Canmore to Oyen. \nMike Fleck is a Brooks vice-principal who sat on the committee that appointed the CIF funding. \nFleck said he liked that teachers worked with the school division to come up with the best way to use the CIF funding to improve classroom conditions. \n\u0093It was very nice to be able to restore some of those positions,\u0094 Fleck said. \nMorrison said a half-time Kindergarten teacher was hired at Okotoks\u0092 Good Shepherd School and an Okotoks education assistant was hired using CIF funding. \nGood Shepherd also had another half-time kindergarten teacher hired during the regular budget process. \nThe elementary school in the Tower Hill area continues to be over 100 per cent capacity, despite the opening of St. Francis of Assisi Academy last year, Morrison said. \nMorrison said another round of hiring will take place in August. \nAbout $600,000 of the division\u0092s CIF spending will be allocated to hire teachers and support staff. Another $412,000 will be spent on classroom improvement supplies, $229,000 will be spent on professional development and $20,000 will be available for teachers to apply for to use for special learning projects. \nThe CIF committee continues to look at emergent requests from schools where classroom size and high populations are a concern when allocating the rest of the CIF funding, Morrison said. \nThe money for classroom improvements will go to items like books for classroom libraries and technology like tablets and chrome books, Morrison said. \n\u0093All classrooms have basic libraries and teachers can enhance them,\u0094 he said. \n\u0093Rather than having to run to the public library or buy books out of pocket, which many do, they will be able to purchase books with this funding. I see a lot of the money going to that.\u0094 \nThe professional development funds will be used to pay teachers to attend workshops in the summer, Morrison said. He said they will focus on numeracy, literacy, English Language Learning and faith. \nThe Foothills School Division (FSD) has a committee looking at how to allocate their $970,000 in CIF funding. FSD assistant superintendent of corporate services, Drew Chipman, said they are working at having a plan in place in the fall when school resumes.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brooks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drew chipman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott morrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fleck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike fleck", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "budget", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "redeemer catholic schools", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ctr catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foothills school division", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fsd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assisi academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "okotoks\u0092 good shepherd school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oyen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tower hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canmore", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:33.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68101855a578ba5cb3be26a616675496d3c6cc78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJ6nPMI8XIUQ7mxXPfKnqRBl02rPU57XdKpZ.VEaEfqsWjU9qUmacDpv542oT37z0eSUWIvXgVYzgu_Ly9JA5c1vNoBFVaej7J", "site_full": "www.homedepot.com", "site": "homedepot.com", "site_section": "https://www.homedepot.com/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Tools/N-5yc1vZcb51/AjaxNavigation", "site_categories": ["interior_decorating", "landscaping", "home_and_garden", "shopping", "appliances"], "section_title": "", "title": "McCulloch Heavy-Duty Portable Steam Cleaner-MC1275", "title_full": "McCulloch Heavy-Duty Portable Steam Cleaner-MC1275 - The Home Depot", "published": "2017-11-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/1491fc74-c1c1-4d2a-8dcc-98d2b1ea93a6/svn/mcculloch-portable-steam-cleaners-mc1275-64_300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 249, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "91e219a5f993f8a0f4159dca20910b438d6dc5b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTloTwFXh44Sy1Yl0ViT0CJ6nPMI8XIUQ7mxXPfKnqRBl02rPU57XdKpZ.VEaEfqsWjU9qUmacDpv542oT37z0eSUWIvXgVYzgu_Ly9JA5c1jMPZoDVPmW9IbA6t9v_CrU-", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "Sara", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "4 Star Review", "text": "Rating provided by a verified purchaser", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 4.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:33.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2edf0cb37aa40f0eae919ce97bfe73932593d0d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTrW.d8EQuFmA67r06v1CYLcUqgla2LSwuHRLO9PBjttPNUceJvEG44", "site_full": "www.demonoid.pw", "site": "demonoid.pw", "site_section": "https://www.demonoid.pw/rss/0.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Demonoid - All categories", "title": "Stephen Colbert 2017 12 06 Ed Helms WEB x264 TBS EZTV", "title_full": "Stephen Colbert 2017 12 06 Ed Helms WEB x264 TBS EZTV", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "PW", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/images/demonlogo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 11728, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2edf0cb37aa40f0eae919ce97bfe73932593d0d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTrW.d8EQuFmA67r06v1CYLcUqgla2LSwuHRLO9PBjttPNUceJvEG44", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EZTVag", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Stephen Colbert 2017 12 06 Ed Helms WEB x264 TBS EZTV", "text": "Your Internet Provider is tracking your torrent activity!

Take it out of Diwali and First Nations etc. in public schools too.", "text": "Today, someone said that all \u2018 religious \u2018 Christmas songs were to be deleted from her school\u2019s celebrations this year. Since Christmas, as we know it, has almost nothing to do with the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ, we could probably delete 90% of it and vastly improve the months of November and December. That would cause some grief to the merchants who depend on Christmas to maintain a healthy bank balance. Conversely the demise of Christmas would vastly improve the finances of people who can\u2019t figure out how to just say no to the frenzied rat race this \u2018religious\u2019 event has devolved into. Jesus, our Lord and Saviour was almost certainly NOT born on December 25th. That was the pagan celebration of Rome. Constantine could not beat down the faith of Christians, though he tried. And he was losing ground anyway, so presto, he declared himself to be a Christian, and by fiat, all of the Roman world was now Christian. Only they were not. So Rome hardly missed a beat and Saturnalia, the pagan Roman winter solstice festival just tucked in a bit about Emanuel, God with us. Back in the early \u201970s I became a Christian, read the Bible, and saw so little resemblance between the wonderful incarnation and the madness all around me, that I simply opted out. My bank customers were friends. One day a fellow paid his Chargex bill. With a deep sight of relief he said, \u201cThis is the last of my Christmas debt.\u201d It was June. On almost all indicators, Christmas is negative. More and higher depression, violence, heart attacks, drunkenness, loneliness, suicide, crushing debt, weariness\u2026\u2026\u2026So why do intelligent sentient beings keep doing this to themselves? Just quit. But there is a question about why schools are being pressured to remove the religious aspects of Christmas. Whether or not the Biblical truths of the birth of the Son of God have been distorted almost entirely out of Christ mas, that very word tells us it is, or was to have had reference to Him. Historically, traditionally, the celebration of Christmas was around the birth of Jesus, the Saviour of the world. So compare: Presents were brought to the Christ-child, by the Magi, probably when He was about two years old. Gold, frankincense and myrrh held symbolic meaning of his royalty, holiness and sacrifice for fallen humanity. No orgy of presents for people who will have to sneak off to the second-hand shops to dump all the unwanted stuff their loved ones rushed and went broke to buy for them. Well Christmas is for the kids: Right. Herod had his henchmen murder all the little boys two years old and under. Great feasting and merriment: Jesus left the splendour of Heaven to be born in a humble stable. Poor shepherds were the first to welcome the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. There is a real advent, that brings light and hope and love to our world, but look for it in God\u2019s revelation to us, the Bible. Okay, so take all religion out of secular schools, and make them places for \u2018readin, ritin, and rithmetic\u2019. But then take the \u2018gods\u2019 out of Diwali. Take the spiritual out of the first nations events that pervade our public school year. In some parts of Canada Muslims are granted their own prayer rooms in public schools, where contrary to the norm, the boys are separated from the girls. Have the jam,\u2026.. politicians, to remove ALL religious events from our secular schools. I\u2019d be fine with that. Let parents and churches and temples and mosques be the places for religious teaching. But if school boards are being ordered to take the Christ out of Christmas, stop being hypocrites, and invent another name entirely for what was once at least a reminder of the Saviour of the world. So while Christmas, as we now have it, is a poor rep for Jesus Christ, one might wonder why even that thin gruel of Biblical faith is so under attack, while other religions in the Judeo-Christian West are given full support. Just wondering. (My reference to Constantine is somewhat simplistic and a fuller study of that period is recommended.) \nhttp://www.classichistory.net During the reign of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (306\u2013337 AD), Christianity began to transition to the dominant religion of the Roman Empire. \u2026 If this made him a Christian is the subject of \u2026 debate,\u201d although he allegedly received a baptism shortly before his death.
