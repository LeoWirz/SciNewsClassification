I vote for that, how about you? But a few of my Christmases have felt hard and ugly mostly because I tried to do too much, spend too much, and go too much. This year won\u2019t be one of those years. I\u2019ve learned that simple is better and often more beautiful when it comes to decorations and life. \nThe Saturday after Thanksgiving Caleb climbed into the attic to retrieve the Christmas boxes. Soon the garage floor was covered with 30+ years worth of decorations. I carefully chose a few things and the rest went back into the attic untouched. \nI\u2019m really happy with the way it turned out. Thanks for taking the time to let me share it with you. My Simple &   \n\nRemember that little red wagon I shared on Instagram last week? A post shared by Stacy Averette (@stacyaverette) on Dec 2, 2017 at 9:07am PST \nI found the perfect spot for it, don\u2019t you think? Click here to follow me on Instagram. \nOn the Saturday after Thanksgiving we always get our live tree. This year we chose a Frazier Fir again. ($29 at Marvin\u2019s!) Our home smells so good! \nI\u2019m looking pretty festive with my plaid scarf and vintage knit cardigan (thrifted of course). 1. Living Room \nMaddie decorated the tree with white lights and just a few colorful balls. Simple and beautiful. \nIn the past, I\u2019ve removed the decor I had throughout the house to make room for all the Christmas decor. This year, I left everything and added just a few Christmas touches. \nFound those ice skates at a yard sale a few years ago for $2. I also have a white pair hanging on the rail outside the front door. 2. Kitchen & Dining Room 3. Guest Bedroom \nThis photo was taken last year when the white, thrifted tree ($8) was in the kitchen. It\u2019s in the guest bedroom this year. 4. Maddie\u2019s Bedroom \nShe bought this tree at a yard sale last spring for $2. 5. Downstairs \nCaleb\u2019s vintage bike found at a yard sale and some vintage, thrifted lights. The print above the bike is also a thrift store find. \nYes, that\u2019s orange shag carpet on the stairs, but we\u2019ll roll with it. More vintage lights on the stairs. The trunk was a $10 yard sale find. (I\u2019ll have to show you the before-and-after photos later.) The door was thrifted ($5) and the chair ($15), because I heart tufted and all those vintage albums were thrifted, most for $1 or less! \nWasn\u2019t that fun?! \nThanks again for stopping by. I hope you\u2019ve been encouraged to keep it simple this Christmas and remember: But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy.

In its fifth year running, this year\u2019s trip will include visits to successful start-ups such as Ellevest, MongoDB, Buzzfeed and General Catalyst Partners. \u201cWe try to find new firms in different spaces,\u201d Rastogi said. \u201cThere\u2019s usually a technical firm, and we try to focus on a media firm, if possible.\u201d The organizers plan to select 36 student applicants to take on the trip. \u201cWe look for the same type of candidate that we look for in our general EP application,\u201d said Jacob Saltzman \u201918, co-president of Brown EP. \u201cSomeone who is thoughtful, who is curious, who is dedicated to building things and trying to innovate and think about the future and do it in interesting ways.\u201d Saltzman, who has been involved in Brown EP throughout his time at Brown, had a worthwhile experience on a Synapse trip to New York as a first-year. \u201cIt was really inspiring to be part of a like-minded community of students, who are willing to hop on a train and spend a weekend in a different city,\u201d Saltzman said. \u201cI was able to meet really smart and curious people who I would not have been able to meet otherwise.\u201d The Synapse series receives funding from the Jonathan M. Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship, which is also aiding the program in expanding to new locations. \u201cWe have a really strong, seamless relationship with EP and its leaders,\u201d said Executive Director of the Center Daniel Warshay \u201987 P\u201920. \u201cWe\u2019re working hard with EP\u2019s leadership to expand Synapse to other cities and even to other countries.\u201d Warshay, who was a founding trustee of Brown EP, is hoping to work with the club to put together a similar trip to Barcelona in the spring. Saltzman shares this goal and looks to expand to other regions of Europe and even the Middle East, he said. \u201cStudents are eager to learn about entrepreneurial ventures by visiting them and hearing from their founders and alumni who work in them,\u201d Warshay said. \u201cThese are really good catalyst programs that introduce \u2014 in some cases (to) people who don\u2019t know anything about entrepreneurship \u2014 what those environments are like and stimulate interest.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohan rastogi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rastogi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saltzman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warshay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacob saltzman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel warshay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buzzfeed", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "general catalyst partners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan m. nelson center for entrepreneurship", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "risd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brown entrepreneurship program", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rhode island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ellevest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:26.022+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ef89eb4ec60ba1ddfc9f9183e2d88ae511a51659", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p.OPtisgNi8gljwQjwenbMqUgZsP8dxYf", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/qst/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/qst/ - Quests - 4chan", "title": "Stranded Mech Quest", "title_full": "/qst/ - Stranded Mech Quest - Quests - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T01:22:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 93, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "68850bb8c7eaeb349ba49e3ff0b4aa27981e5d10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1p.OPtisgNi8gljwQjwenbMiNxyk4tcFHJXKqiRbP4WI8-", "ord_in_thread": 62, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "..never mind disregard the above post...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:41:26.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e247062eaee9783a440ebe51623e366549bcefe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqrL9nbYsw_AQflEYLooRCGoCUJXLEajKMCMf1xSIC69XRTdqz8HqFKtMvgNYrqep_LJQnQeMNfWvw3Y9tS.NyBoAV0ul5PN4XTpKw8J7Fl8w--", "site_full": "bargainexercisebikes.us", "site": "bargainexercisebikes.us", "site_section": "http://bargainexercisebikes.us/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Exercise Bikes", "title": "ProForm Tour De France Trainer Spin Bike", "title_full": "ProForm Tour De France Trainer Spin Bike", "published": "2017-12-07T09:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0e247062eaee9783a440ebe51623e366549bcefe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqrL9nbYsw_AQflEYLooRCGoCUJXLEajKMCMf1xSIC69XRTdqz8HqFKtMvgNYrqep_LJQnQeMNfWvw3Y9tS.NyBoAV0ul5PN4XTpKw8J7Fl8w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2017-12-07T09:26:00.000+02:00", "title": "ProForm Tour De France Trainer Spin Bike", "text": "ProForm Tour De France Trainer Spin Bike by admin on Dec.07, 2017, under Uncategorized \nVery lightly used Tour De France Stationary Bike.

But doctors and women have hoped that the newer generations of low-dose contraceptive pills, IUDs and implants eliminated the breast cancer risk of earlier, higher-dose formulations. \nNow a big study from Denmark suggests the elevated risk of getting breast cancer \u2014 while still very small for women in their teens, 20s and 30s \u2013 holds true for these low-dose methods, too. \nIn the research published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine , a team of scientists studied 1.8 million women between the ages of 15 and 49. They were looking to see what happened over a stretch of nearly 11 years among women who used hormonal birth control \u2014 usually a combination of estrogen and progestin \u2014 versus women who relied on non-hormonal contraceptive methods, such as a condom, diaphragm or copper IUD. \nUnlike most previous research, this study didn't just track the effect of birth control pills. Because their set of data was very large, scientists this time were also able to get a good sense of the impact of various other hormonal methods \u2014 including the birth control patch, the ring, and implants as well as hormone-releasing IUDs. \nThe results showed it didn't much matter what sort of hormonal method was used, says Lina Morch , a research epidemiologist at the University of Copenhagen, who led the study. \nOverall, Morch says, she and her colleagues found \"a roughly 20 percent increased risk [of breast cancer] among women who currently use some type of hormonal contraception.\" And the longer the women used hormonal methods, she says, the higher their risk. \nThat may sound scary. But Morch and other doctors say it's important to consider how that additional risk translates in terms of actual cases of breast cancer. The illness is fairly rare among women in the age group studied. \n\"A 20 percent increase of a very small number is still a very small number,\" says Mia Gaudet , an epidemiologist with the American Cancer Society. The risk contributed by hormonal contraception, she says, is similar to the extra breast cancer risk contributed by physical inactivity, excessive weight gain in adulthood, or drinking an average of one or more alcoholic drinks per day. \n\"The absolute increase in risk [found in the study] is 13 per 100,000 women overall, but only 2 per 100,000 women younger than 35 years of age,\" writes epidemiologist David Hunter , of the University of Oxford, in an editorial accompanying the study in NEJM . \n\"Most of the cases that occurred in this analysis occurred among women who were using oral contraceptives in their 40s,\" Hunter adds. \nAny additional risk of breast cancer, he says, should be weighed against the clear benefits of hormonal contraception \u2014 benefits that go beyond the obvious advantages of preventing unwanted pregnancy. \n\"There's very good evidence,\" Hunter says, \"that oral contraceptives reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. They reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. And there's a strong suggestion they also reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. So, many calculations suggest that the use of oral contraceptives actually prevents more cancers than it causes.\" \nThe search for new hormonal contraceptives \u2014 methods that don't elevate breast cancer risk at all \u2014 should continue, Hunter says. \nMeanwhile, a conversation with your doctor can help you figure out which contraceptive method makes most sense for you.   \nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: \nNew research finds an increased risk of breast cancer among women who are using hormonal birth control. The study's published in The New England Journal of Medicine, and NPR's Patti Neighmond has our report. \nPATTI NEIGHMOND, BYLINE: Scientists have long known contraceptives that contain estrogen can increase the risk of breast cancer. But researchers in Denmark looked at 1.8 million women between the ages of 15 and 49 to see if new lower-dosed formulations are still risky. They compared what happened over nearly 11 years among women taking hormonal birth control and women using other methods. Epidemiologist Lina Morch headed the study. \nLINA MORCH: We found approximately a 20 percent increased risk among women who currently use some type of hormonal contraception. \nNEIGHMOND: Hormonal contraception releases estrogen, progestin or a combination of both to suppress ovulation and prevent pregnancy. Mia Gaudet with the American Cancer Society says the findings are compelling because researchers didn't just look at the birth control pill. They looked at all birth control methods that release hormones. \nMIA GAUDET: Including the patch, the ring, the implant, as well as IUD. \nNEIGHMOND: All of these forms of hormonal contraception increased breast cancer risk by 20 percent. And the longer women used this type of birth control, the more breast cancer risk increased. The findings are disappointing, says epidemiologist David Hunter with the University of Oxford. Over the past few decades, researchers tried to develop new hormonal formulas using less estrogen, which is known to promote breast cancer. The hope was the lower dose would decrease breast cancer risk. But that's not what this study found. \nDAVID HUNTER: Unfortunately, the increase of 20 percent appears to apply to the most recent formulations just like it did in the '70s, '80s and '90s. So this tells us that things haven't changed. \nNEIGHMOND: Lead researcher Morch says the findings should serve as a caution but not an alarm. A 20 percent increase translates into only one extra breast cancer case for nearly every 8,000 women. It's even lower among younger women since breast cancer in this age group is relatively rare. \nMORCH: So it has to be balanced - the pros and cons of these contraceptives. And if it's not needed to take hormonal contraceptions, it might be worth considering using other methods like the copper IUD or barium if it's - like condoms, for instance. \nNEIGHMOND: Now, it's important to note in the study, women over 40 were more likely to suffer breast cancer than younger women in their 20s and 30s. Age, family history and weight gain later in life all contribute to breast cancer risk. Morch suggests women over 40 discuss possible alternatives with their doctor. And epidemiologist Hunter says there are other clear benefits of hormonal contraception. \nHUNTER: There's very good evidence that oral contraceptives reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. They reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. There's a strong suggestion they actually reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. And so many calculations suggest that use of all contraceptives actually prevents more cancers than it causes. \nNEIGHMOND: Hunter says the search for new hormonal contraceptives that don't elevate breast cancer risk should continue.

Photography: Wikimedia Commons / Thebusofdoom Published on 07 December 2017 by Stephanie Vigilante \nTwo of Melbourne\u2019s busiest railway lines will shut down for seven days in January due to network upgrades, the state government announced today. \nFrom January 2 to January 9, buses will replace trains between Flinders Street and Westall on the Cranbourne-Pakenham line, and Flinders Street and Moorabbin on the Frankston line. \nBuses will also replace trains between Caulfield and Dandenong from January 10 to January 17, as well as between Westall and Dandenong for two weeks in February. Gippsland V/Line services will also be affected . \nThe closures are expected to add between 40 to 75 minutes of extra travel time for some commuters, but will allow upgrades to signalling, power and communications elements of the rail network ahead of the introduction of 65 new high-capacity trains in early-2019. \nMinister for Public Transport Jacinta Allan described the upgrades as \u201cthe biggest investment in better trains services for Melbourne\u2019s south east in a generation\u201d in a statement , promising they will ease congestion and boost road safety. \nAll nine level crossings between Caulfield and Dandenong will be removed by the end of 2018. \nUnfortunately, the Cranbourne-Pakenham line is the city\u2019s busiest \u2013 ferrying more than 90,000 passengers every weekday. \nOn an average day 150,000 passengers travel within Flinders Street and Moorabbin stations, although crowds will be significantly less during the summer.

Fill in the form below your name:   6 click to enlarge This exceptionally beautiful horse is a real pleasure to have around. She is good in the field, good to catch, comes in on her own or stays out on her own without a fuss. Good for the farrier. Used to farm traffic. Ties up, polite to lead. I bought her as backed and turned away as I wanted a beautiful nice natured horse to breed from, unfortunately the stallion I wanted to use is no longer with us so my plans have changed. I have re introduced her to long reining which she is brilliant at, stops and goes to voice , she happily wears tack and lets a rider sit on her. This is as far as I have gone as I don't have time to keep up the riding and due to lack of facilities I am doing it in an open farm yard. I think with a couple of weeks ground work she will be a fab and valuable horse, she is just so willing and happy to be worked. Please phone or text as I have been told messages don't always get through.\u00a32000 for sale only experienced people only as she needs finishing.

Nearly three quarters of first-years agree with this sentiment \u2014 the highest percentage of any class year. Patrick Heller, chair of the sociology department, said that at the University, conversations about controversial topics often arise during classroom discussions. \u201cBrown faculty and students have always been committed to openly engaging with all of the difficult and challenging questions of our time,\u201d he said. Many faculty members in the social sciences and humanities departments have been trained in teaching and leading discussions during their time in PhD programs, said Dean of the Faculty Kevin McLaughlin. Yet, \u201cif it\u2019s reflected in student or colleague evaluations that (discussions led by a professor) lacked focus or didn\u2019t cover material assigned for class, the department helps (that professor) improve for next year,\u201d McLaughlin said, though he added that the University does not facilitate official trainings. Faculty can receive individual help from the Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning. The center\u2019s website contains a number of links that provide strategies for leading effective group discussions, including advice on creating an inclusive environment, using the method of active listening and asking students to lay out evidence-based arguments. In light of the Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan, the Sheridan Center, along with the Office of the Dean of the College, also ran workshops about how to tackle sensitive topics in the classroom, such as race and gender. Graduate students also receive instruction on teaching practices. They are allowed to serve as teaching assistants beginning their second year and only after attending a summer workshop or course about effective teaching, McLaughlin added. Kenneth Wong, chair of the education department, emphasized that good discussions connect with the course\u2019s assigned readings and learning goals. \u201cWe want class discussions to be grounded in the knowledge that we cover in a particular session,\u201d he added. To stimulate discussion, Wong usually \u201cpose(s) a couple of critical questions for the class to think through based on the readings.\u201d When discussing hot topics, such as charter schools in an education policy class, Wong added that professors \u201chave a particularly instrumental role to play, (which is to make) sure that all the voices are heard and articulated.\u201d Controversial topics can make some students hesitant to share their opinions. \u201cThere\u2019s some fear of being politically incorrect \u2026 or not saying the right thing, but that can be broken down,\u201d said Anthony Levitas, director of the undergraduate public policy program. \u201cIt\u2019s critically important that we don\u2019t shy away from arguments and ideas we don\u2019t agree with.\u201d Clubs provide additional opportunities for discourse outside of the classroom. The Alexander Hamilton Society hosts U.S. foreign policy debates between professors and outside experts, such as military personnel. \u201cWe try to focus on issues that are highly complex and not easy to answer with a yes or no question, topics that are nuanced, thought-provoking and (ones that) not everyone spends their time thinking about,\u201d said Jake Goodman \u201919, president of the Brown chapter. He added that classroom lectures are often one-sided because they are presented from the perspective of the professor. Not every student agrees that University faculty members give enough space for opposing viewpoints. Charis Edwards \u201921 noticed that teaching assistants and professors often hesitate to present ideas with which they disagree. \u201cBecause (they) don\u2019t want to encourage (their) listeners to investigate a perspective (they) think is problematic or incorrect, it promotes ignorance to ignore the existence of other opinions, especially when (professors are) charged with giving an educational overview,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cIn my public health class, we often discuss policy interventions that would probably have wonderful effects on the improvement of public health, but we rarely discuss the fact (that) those same interventions could be viewed as drastic government overreach,\u201d Edwards wrote in a follow-up email to The Herald, adding that this ignores \u201ca very real perspective.\u201d \u201cWe ought to learn how to listen to one another \u2026 (and) how to build our knowledge base so that we can continue to mature professionally as well as academically,\u201d Wong said.

While 3.1 percent of non-athletes reported using painkillers recreationally, 8.3 percent of polled athletes reported that they do. Researchers said athletes \u2014 who may overuse painkillers to cope with pressure to perform at high levels \u2014 could be at greater risk for painkiller abuse than non-athletes due to their increased access to prescriptions. Multiple varsity athletes responded via email that they were not aware of recreational use of these drugs among their teammates but mentioned that, in the case of injury, athletic trainers can provide such prescriptions. Recently, the Trump administration declared the opioid crisis a national health emergency but did not allocate any funding to deal with the issue. Between 2005 and 2015, opioid-related deaths among Americans age 24 and under almost doubled, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Opioid-related emergency room visits by young people also nearly doubled over five years, according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Though \u201cpainkiller\u201d can be used to mean drugs such as Ibuprofen and Tylenol, these pain relievers function by reducing fever and inflammation. Painkillers, on the other hand, include powerful opioids such as Hydrocodone and Oxycodone. When used for non-medical purposes, painkillers can create a \u201chigh\u201d similar to that of other opioids, such as heroin. According to an NCAA study, student-athletes are prescribed narcotics for pain medications at higher rates than other students. And in a recent New York Times article, one researcher pointed out that athletes in high-contact sports, such as ice hockey or wrestling, are often prescribed these medications and can be especially vulnerable. The men\u2019s lacrosse, women\u2019s ice hockey, wrestling and volleyball teams did not respond to requests for comment. \u201cFrom what I know about painkillers, they are mainly prescribed by either team or personal physicians in response to injuries,\u201d wrote Richard \u201cDewey\u201d Jarvis \u201917.5, co-captain of the football team, in an email to The Herald. \u201cBut most of the painkillers that we are prescribed do not have narcotic effects.\u201d Generally, Brown coaches discourage the use of painkillers among their teams, even for medical purposes. Sara Carver-Milne, head coach of the gymnastics team, said she encourages team members to listen to their bodies and openly discuss their health. \u201cWe do not in any way recommend that they use painkillers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have them see our trainer before and after every practice to ensure that they\u2019re taken care of and ensure that they\u2019re taking the steps necessary to be healthy.\u201d Of the student-athletes contacted by The Herald, few mentioned specific painkillers, but some said they had been prescribed Meloxicam (commonly referred to as Mobic), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and Codeine, an opioid. Erika Steeves \u201919 and Megan Reilly \u201918, co-captains of the women\u2019s basketball team, wrote in an email to The Herald that they had been prescribed both these drugs to aid with injury recovery. \u201cWhile we didn\u2019t necessarily use them, they\u2019re still in our possession,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOnce we don\u2019t need them anymore, we have to give them to our trainer, but I don\u2019t think the same can be said for every sport.\u201d Opioids or not, painkillers can still be dangerous for athletes in developing drug dependencies, a fact that athletes, coaches and professionals alike are aware of, at both the collegiate and professional level. Philip Veliz, research assistant professor at the Institute for Research on Women & Gender at the University of Michigan, said athletes may use prescription painkillers to \u201cmask pain in order for them to participate\u201d in their sport. \u201cIf they do have a really nagging injury and they don\u2019t want to sit out, they may be using those (substances) so they can continue to participate,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might have the mentality that they\u2019re going to do whatever it takes in order to get back on the playing field and perform at an optimal level.\u201d After performing with the aid of these substances for an extended period of time, athletes might believe they must continue using these drugs to maintain the same level of performance. For college athletes in particular, Veliz said, \u201cyour identity really hinges on this idea of being a confident athlete. If you can\u2019t maintain that, you\u2019re going to have this anxiety that you\u2019re going to lose your friends or your close relationships.\u201d \u201cAthletes may have more internalized pressure to \u2026 self-medicate in order to perform,\u201d he added. Bryan Denham, chair of the communication department within the College of Behavioral, Social and Health Science at Clemson University, said \u201csensation seekers\u201d may be more prone to shift from using painkillers as performance enhancers to recreational pleasure. \u201cSensation seekers tend to be a bit more willing to experiment with drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey often are injured and need a pain reliever, but sometimes that sense of well-being is too much to resist, and they continue with using these drugs.\u201d Kenneth Leonard, director of the Research Institute on Addictions at The State University of New York at Buffalo, echoed Denham\u2019s sentiment in an email to The Herald. \u201cI would imagine that there are a fair number of athletes who are high risk-takers, and, perhaps, this risk-taking also involves substances.\u201d Sometimes the choice to misuse these substances is not even for thrill-seeking, but simply to feel better. Jeremiah Gardner, manager of the Hazelden Betty Ford Institute for Recovery Advocacy who is himself in long-time recovery, said that those who are inclined to use other substances recreationally might be more at risk for using painkillers that way if they\u2019ve been exposed to them. \u201cIf you\u2019re a student who is inclined to drink or perhaps use marijuana, if you\u2019ve used opioids for medical reasons and experienced the feeling that comes with that, it no longer is a stretch to think you might use those for recreational purposes,\u201d he said. The Herald\u2019s poll found that 87 percent of athletes drink alcohol, whereas 80 percent of non-athletes do so. Rates of marijuana use were the same for each group \u2014 around half have used it in the last year.

Al Franken Will Resign", "text": "Originally published on December 6, 2017 7:56 pm   \nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: \nSome breaking news from Minnesota tonight. Minnesota Public Radio News reports that Senator Al Franken will announce his resignation from the Senate tomorrow. His decision comes after at least 30 Senate Democrats, including leader Chuck Schumer, today called on Franken to step down. Joining us now from the Capitol is NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis. Hey there. \nSUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey there. \nKELLY: So these allegations of sexual harassment against Franken have been out there for weeks. What changed today that prompted this avalanche of Democrats to call for him to step aside? \nDAVIS: Politico reported this morning about a seventh accuser. It was an anonymous woman, but she alleged that in 2006 then Al Franken, who was a comedian, not yet a senator, had - again - forcibly tried to kiss her. This is what a group of female senators, including New York Democrat Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, said for them was the tipping point. This morning, in a very rapid succession, about a half a dozen female Democratic senators put out statements calling for him to resign. And they sort of started an avalanche. From that point throughout the day, Democrats in the Senate, one after another, just started calling for Franken to resign. \nI spoke to several Democratic aides who had said that this was a conversation that had been happening quietly inside the Democratic caucus for several days now but that it was just determined that it was time for him to go. I do want to add one note of caution - that the senator's office tweeted out that his final decision had not been made. He will make an announcement tomorrow. But Democrats here in the Capitol tonight certainly expect that that announcement will be his resignation. \nKELLY: Now, this, of course, comes just a day after Michigan Democratic Congressman John Conyers resigned over sexual harassment allegations. Is this starting to add up to a message that Democrats are sending? \nDAVIS: You know, we have to also talk about that this is happening, one, in this broader context of this national conversation, and then within politics, it's also happening as the Alabama Senate races is playing out. \nKELLY: Sure. \nDAVIS: And I think Democrats, particularly following President Trump's decision to re-back Roy Moore and for the Republican National Committee to get back into that race even though Moore is facing similar allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault, Democrats want to draw contrasts. Party leaders like Nancy Pelosi are saying that they want to be a party of zero tolerance towards this kind of behavior. And I would note that it might not be over. There are two additional sitting congressmen in the House - a Republican from Texas, Blake Farenthold, and a Democrat from Nevada, Ruben Kihuen - who are facing allegations of sexual harassment, and they are also facing some calls to step aside. \nKELLY: Well, other than calling for lawmakers to step aside, what else is Congress doing in response to all of these allegations? Is there some sort of legislative action, some bill brewing? \nDAVIS: It's actually been quite a lot. Already both chambers in the House and the Senate have passed new rules to mandate sexual harassment training for everyone that works here, including lawmakers, once a year. They also have competing legislation that would affect both internally how sexual harassment is handled inside the Capitol. And today, Gillibrand introduced a bipartisan bill that would essentially end forced arbitration in private companies when - they say as many as 60 million Americans, when you sign up to work for a company, part of your terms of employment or that if you have a sexual harassment complaint, it has to go through a mandatory private arbitration process. They want to get rid of that. \nI would note at this event today that I covered they also had former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson there to make a statement because she was one of these women, these tipping point women, that started this national conversation. So, yeah, you know, there's just - there's significant momentum, and I would say this has bipartisan support. There's a lot of Republicans in support of this legislation who want to capture this cultural moment and send a message that it's time to sort of remake how we think about the American workplace. \nKELLY: And real quick, Sue, to circle you back to Al Franken - if he does say he's resigning, what happens to his seat? \nDAVIS: They have a Democratic governor, it's Mark Dayton. He would get to appoint an interim senator. He's a Democrat, so there's no chance this seat will flip in the short term.

It is also anticipated to register CAGR of 2.9% during the forecast period between 2017 and 2026. The global wax market is also expected to bring in US$ 11,017.7 million revenue towards the end of 2026. There are different types of waxes being used for various applications. For instance, the fossil-based wax is being largely used for making candles, coatings and polishing, and in packaging. Meanwhile, paraffin wax which is derived from various processes of crude oil refining is being used in beauty and cosmetic care industry as it is safe to use. However, the demand for paraffin wax is declining as the demand for bio-based wax is growing, especially in the various countries in Asia-Pacific. The fully refined waxes are also widely used for candle making and as wax coatings for paper, film and foil substrates used in the packaging. The global wax market has also become highly volatile in the recent years owing to the price volatility of crude oil.
