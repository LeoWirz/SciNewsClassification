After officially finishing your training in the retainment of Essence, that most basic and essential skill, you and a few other children were packed onto a wagon and sent off. A weeks journey and several pickups later, and you had arrived at the institution you would call home for the next five years. Ithlum was not at all like you expected. Instead of a clinical, scholarly place of learning, it was a barren, militaristic facility, ominous and full of hidden hazards.\nYour first few weeks were spent easing you and your classmates into things, giving you all a taste of what awaited each sect, and then, once you had all chosen, you were all thrown into the deep end. Little time was given to any of you to fraternize, and the teachers were all busy and distracted, more concerned with their own research projects than dealing with unwanted students. It soon became apparent to you that most of your learning here would take the form of peering over the shoulders of the researchers here as you were put to work as a research assistant. Mayhap an arrangement unsatisfactory to most, but then, you were not most - you knew you were of such a mind that you could glean knowledge from your surroundings whether actively taught or not, and mayhap learn even more this way than otherwise - you get to observe cutting-edge research first-hand here, after all. All you need to do is understand it.\nYour classmates, however, were not doing as well. Where you flourished and soaked up all available knowledge like a sponge, they meandered miserably, taking far longer to adjust. And your observation of your classmates was also a potent reminder of the hazards of receiving one's education in an active research installation - a few students disappeared in the first few weeks of your class's new life in Ithlum, and always immediately following a disappearance were there new admonishments from your instructors to keep away from the labs while unsupervised, and to be cautious even while chaperoned.\nOne day, while attending one of your instructors as an assistant along with a few other students in one of the larger lab-spaces, a Servile goes tumbling into one of the Creation enclosures while feeding the beasts inside, an experimental new pack-predator Creation type. The Servile quickly gets to their feet and backs up to the wall of the enclosure, a wide grassy pit carved into the floor, and is summarily pounced upon by the pack. Your instructor merely takes notes, and scolds one of your classmates when they puke.\n(Reference image - http://exquisitebeast.tumblr.com/post/34847828377/the-eightieth-beast-the-beasts-feathers-have )\nThe Outsider soldiers who guard the facility are rather more typical as people than your instructors, gambling and joking with one another off-duty, and occasionally giving aid to students even when on-duty. A typical complaint you hear from them is that their furlough has been delayed - apparently finding soldiers to guard Ithlum is a difficult endeavor, considering its remote location and disturbing practices.\nRoughly two months in, you finally manage to Shape a Creation, and you are the first of your class to manage it. It is a mindless slug-thing, as simple a Creation as it is possible to Shape, and it still manages to consume half of your Essence reserves to create, and yet, it gives you a rush of satisfaction and a feeling of power like nothing else you have experienced. You just created life! And soon, you shall be a thousand times better at it. This is only the beginning.\nWhat was your reaction to the incident with the Servile?\nHow do you spend your scant moments of free time?\nWhat manner of experiments and research projects do you observe most closely?\n- Alchemical experiments\n- Development of new Creations\n- Research into raw Essence manipulation\n- Research into Essence-based enchantment\n- Further refinement of ability to control Creations\n- Other (write-in)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://exquisitebeast.tumblr.com/post/34847828377/the-eightieth-beast-the-beasts-feathers-have"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:37.020+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4eeb25c6830144f66502de03ad1adfa9af89a1aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpwbDi1L3n5aSdG.d6YfNcXF3WBHZ2zt0WeKt7eaiaOQW82OvfcE8z2DP0u5mp6ejsH3UroyeqNVQ--", "site_full": "safuannnnhkm.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://safuannnnhkm.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Creps & Murmurs", "title": "Character Flaw", "title_full": "Character Flaw", "published": "2017-07-19T06:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "48424b821b6a791b5727770176febbab3ca5593b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpwbDi1L3n5aSdG.d6YfNcXF3WBHZ2zt0WeKt7eaiaOQW82OvfcE8z2DP0u5mp6ejvhtNPqGt2klR2IxNW7BWQP", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-06T11:22:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Salam'alayk Safuan,\n\nI found your blog recently when I was searching for information on PTM and HO related stuff and guess what?

So that was very rewarding.\u201d \nMurphy believes the issues raised in Feud are still relevant in today\u2019s society. \nHe said: \u201cEven though it\u2019s set in 1962, the themes and issues in the show are so modern, and women are still going through this sort of stuff today that they went through 50 years ago, and nothing has really changed, and we really wanted to lean into that aspect of the show.\u201d \n\u2013 Feud: Bette And Joan starts on BBC Two on Saturday December 16 at 9pm.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n(Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets Inc and CME Group Inc will launch futures contracts on bitcoin on Dec. 10 and Dec. 17 respectively.\nHere are some of the differences between the products to be offered by the exchange operators.\nCONTRACT UNIT\n-The Cboe Bitcoin Futures Contract will use the ticker XBT and will equal one bitcoin.\n-The CME Bitcoin Futures Contract will use the ticker BTC and will equal five bitcoins.\nPRICING AND SETTLEMENT\n-Both Cboe's and CME's bitcoin futures contracts will be settled in U.S. dollars, allowing exposure to the bitcoin without actually having to hold any of the cryptocurrency.\n-Cboe's contract will be priced off of a single auction at 4 p.m. Eastern time (2100 GMT) on the final settlement date on the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange.\n-CME's contract will be priced off of the CME Bitcoin Reference Rate, an index that references pricing data from cryptocurrency exchanges, currently made up of Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken.\nTRADING HOURS\n-Cboe's XBT contract will trade on CFE, with regular trading hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Eastern time on Mondays and 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m Tuesday through Friday. Extended hours will be 6 p.m. Sunday to 9:30 a.m. Monday, and 4:30 p.m. Monday through to 9:30 a.m. Friday.\n-CME's BTC will trade on CME Globex and CME ClearPort Sunday to Friday from 6 p.m. - 5 p.m. Eastern time with a one-hour break each day beginning at 5 p.m.\nMARGIN RATE AND CLEARING\n-Cboe's contract will clear through the Options Clearing Corporation and a 30 percent margin rate will apply.\n-CME's contract will clear through CME ClearPort and will have a 35 percent initial margin rate.\nCONTRACT EXPIRATIONS\n-Cboe said it may list up to four weekly contracts, three near-term serial months, and three months on the March quarterly cycle.\n-CME said it will list monthly contracts for the nearest two months in the March quarterly cycle (March, June, Sept., Dec.) plus the nearest two serial months not in the March quarterly cycle.\nPRICE LIMITS AND TRADING HALTS\n-Cboe will halt trading in its contract for 2 minutes if the best bid in the XBT futures contract closest to expiration is 10 percent or more above or below the daily settlement price of that contract on the prior business day.\nOnce trading resumes, if the best bid in the XBT futures contract closest to expiration is 20 percent or more above or below the daily settlement price of that contract on the prior business day, the futures will be halted for 5 minutes.\n-CME will apply price limits, also known as circuit breakers, to its bitcoin futures of 7 percent, 13 percent, and 20 percent to the futures fixing price. Trading will not be allowed outside of the 20 percent price limit.\nSources: Cboe and CME\n(Reporting by John McCrank in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)\n 07", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:40.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19db79d8e65d3b74ee616df85089e0791b7a4ed8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTepTxvDProlAXzVmwujMWHIxZ8aQPW69aX8XQkjAEKXwWCrgcUMI2br4GR3mst9v0-", "site_full": "ubuntuforums.org", "site": "ubuntuforums.org", "site_section": "https://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=125", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Ubuntu Specialised Support", "title": "Settings -> Network not displaying 'Wired' setting", "title_full": "Settings -> Network not displaying 'Wired' setting", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2783, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad2e07f8e3371e4c1f56320c11fdfedab0f4a3c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTepTxvDProlAXzVmwujMWHIxZ8aQPW69aX8XQkjAEKXwWCrgcUMI2bLGBA1eTcHskH_YZ.k1xMDQkoRHjayUgE", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "dino99", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Re: Settings -> Network not displaying 'Wired' setting Thanks Jeremy\nproblem reported lp:1736880 UbuntuGuide Help Ubuntu Zesty Upgrades", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:40.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "553c0fa3d89a6106ca5a4a2a3adb316a35edcaa7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pDSIlap_VpOZRIfujCalIJBp0ico4qmmJ", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/an/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/an/ - Animals &amp; Nature - 4chan", "title": "Cat General", "title_full": "/an/ - Cat General - Animals & Nature - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-01T19:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 46, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d5afbfe72328dbdd4be7409af6657bb5917ff1b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pDSIlap_VpOZRIfujCalIJLQ7zSZ2XJPUdG.N3lUNE0s-", "ord_in_thread": 46, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T09:11:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>2545078\nGood luck anon.

Getting the facts right is only half the fun and learning about how to serve, taste or enjoy wine can make your night complete. The following article will focus on some great tips that will help you enjoy your next bottle of wine!\nThe best way to enjoy wine is responsibly. Know your limits and ensure that you don\u2019t overdo it, especially when with guests. While some wine with lunch or dinner is always in good taste, becoming sloppy afterwards due to drunkenness is not. Enjoyed in moderation, wine will be your friend for life.\nWine can be used to make a tasty sauce when serving beef. To do this, just mix a red wine with a little butter on a saucepan. Simmer the sauce while it thickens and evaporates a little of the alcohol content. You should then drizzle your sauce over your beef dish.\n\nKeep in mind that the color of the wine is not always the same as color of the grapes that are used to make it. The color results from the process of wine making and it is the skin of the grape used in the process that gives an individual wine its final color.\nUse Windex against wine stains. Windex has the fighting power to eliminate wine stains immediately, much better than soap and water will. Do this quick though, as the longer you wait, the more it sets in.\nAll wines do not taste good while at the same temperature. White wines are better when they are cold, while red wines should be a little below room temperature. Drinking them at the wrong temperature can change the way they are supposed to take, which may change your overall opinion.\nA good tip if you\u2019d like to get more into wine is to come to your own conclusions. Everyone\u2019s a critic these days and wine is no exception. If you\u2019re just blindly following a so-called expert\u2019s advice, you\u2019d be doing yourself a disservice. Instead, try to figure out what you like on your own.\nPurchase the Magnum bottles in the store, which are a bit larger, giving you the best bang for your buck. These wines will generally run for about 10 or 15 dollars, and will last a little bit longer for the price. This is a great way to maximize your monetary value of wine if you drink often.\nDon\u2019t worry about trying to identify all the flavors in a wine that you are tasting. Some people have a natural affinity for this while others do not. Try to focus instead on how much alcohol is in the product, as well as what type of fruit may be included. Over time, you will probably be able to get a good feel for these elements.\nLook around your local area for good wines. Wine is produced in ALL 50 states. You may find a great vineyard that you can take a day trip to. Supporting your local wine growers is great in itself; however, there are many gems being made right here at home that often go overlooked.\nAsk if you can taste a few wines before buying. Most wine stores will offer tastings to their customers on a regular basis or set schedule. By trying a few varieties in the store, you can increase your chances of walking out with a bottle you really love. https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/may/04/10-best-restaurants-in-italy-readers-travel-tips-rome-naples is a better way to shop than buying blindly.\n\nAs you sip your glass, think about what ingredients may make up the wine you are drinking. Concentrate hard, and you may pick out a note of fruit or flowers. There might also be secondary aromas like smoke, caramel, or honey. Heed each scent and you will soon know how to recognize them all.\nBreak out of the pairings mythology. It\u2019s not the case that reds only taste good with meats and whites only with fish. There are wines on both sides that pair up well with these dishes. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/wine/italy-vs-france-best/ up your mind to experimenting with these variations. Otherwise you may be limiting your creativity with wine!\nHere is a little bit of wine history for you: wine has been around for as long as 7,000 years! Egyptians are the first civilization we know of to have records of drinking wine, and those date back to 2,500 B.C. They created wines much like we do today, including bottling the beverage and storing it.\nThe body of a wine is a great way to pair it with a dish. The \u201cbody\u201d of a wine refers to how substantial the wine is. It often also correlates with the alcohol content, with fuller-bodied wine containing more alcohol than a lighter wine. Heavier dishes should be paired with a full-bodied wine, as a lighter wine runs the risk of tasting watery when paired with something like a hearty steak.\nGo global in your wine selecting process! Previously, fine wines were considered to be exclusive to certain countries. These days, however, nearly every continent is producing a delicious wine. Limiting yourself to only France or Italy will keep you from enjoying amazing new creations from places like Australia and Brazil!\nYou need to let your wine breathe a little before you start to drink. You may use a carafe, a large glass, or a decanter. Pour some wine into your container. Give your wine ten minutes or so to settle. You can then drink some from the bottle to tell the difference. The glass that breaths will have a more robust, smooth flavor.\nStudy up on the right temperatures to drink certain wines. Yes, a few degrees can make a major difference when it comes to a wine\u2019s overall flavor. You may find your favorite wine is perfect at room temperature, but a few degrees warmer or cooler lowers its quality. Keep notes on these peculiarities so that you can make the right choices down the line.\nTry to gauge your individual taste preferences when buying a bottle of wine. Do you prefer an oak based flavor? Is sweet wine your thing? Are you partial to bold wines or more delicate varieties? By knowing a few details about the type of wine you enjoy, you can pick a bottle out with ease.\nNothing compliments a good meal like a great glass of wine. Hopefully this article has proven valuable to you in learning the selection process. When paired up properly, a great wine can turn time at the table into a mini-celebration. Use these tips next time you are in a wine shop and enjoy!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:40.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c81cddb02a3ece8054e3c73abe9a4fc2bed3d785", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPUqUIaof0kFeSqOqLRH8bEpwVPZ_G9HTIOMdGuIu9BRgSDrzXyavCXZcXu4l3sD9Og8E7WGnoLzqBke_POxDgx8HChvs49h.Gb1uyembF.JA_U4AZ_9vjp4-", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com", "site": "tripadvisor.com", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g294245-i3256-Philippines.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Philippines Forum, Travel Discussion for Philippines - TripAdvisor", "title": "Nikniks - El Nido", "title_full": "Nikniks - El Nido Forum - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-07T08:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 189, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c81cddb02a3ece8054e3c73abe9a4fc2bed3d785", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiY6PHeTKPoqXOg6S4gsZDlPUqUIaof0kFeSqOqLRH8bEpwVPZ_G9HTIOMdGuIu9BRgSDrzXyavCXZcXu4l3sD9Og8E7WGnoLzqBke_POxDgx8HChvs49h.Gb1uyembF.JA_U4AZ_9vjp4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "SojeRho", "published": "2017-12-07T08:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "Nikniks - El Nido", "text": "just buy off lotion an over the counter insect repellent lotion.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:47:41.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5b39475bccb78e4a89550d2e3b2e78299f25844", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7Dxe3.eL0hE4yIeWNVNokA4DC2KYjD5zWfiQqoi2fp656YSoYEKTZLE.vKbFfCx6mVsQpLpw8gHVSVVpdUeENko-", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html?page=2&sort=newest&pagesize=15&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'html' Questions - Page 2 - Stack Overflow", "title": "html - Stop tooltip span from wrapping at each word in CSS", "title_full": "html - Stop tooltip span from wrapping at each word in CSS - Stack Overflow", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1a56ee4a67d392e29336602a3c94f7e4fdd9b636", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLtZqyWX0qjG7Dxe3.eL0hE4yIeWNVNokA4DC2KYjD5zWfiQqoi2fp656YSoYEKTZLE.vKbFfCx6mVsQpLpw8gHVrZQ2EkKPkYs-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "jcvamp", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "add style=\"width: auto;\" in to your span tag it will work\n<br><br><br><br><br> <!--<br>s to move the paragraph down--> <p>This is some text, with a <a href=\"#\" id=\"gloss\">link<span style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"tooltiptext\">Here is some information about the link</span></a>.

I can't think of a single credible person on this site that would disagree that cake < broccoli in terms of HEALTH, but common sense would have us all strike a balance that allows us the freedom to include foods we love to eat because they taste good, with foods we love to eat because they have health benefits. You don't have to be one way or the other. Persons on either side of this argument are equally obnoxious and I personally like to hang out in the calories have context middle ground.\nA diet of nothing but broccoli could possibly more detrimental to your health than a diet of nothing but cake.\nIn terms of HEALTH, context of the entire diet is important, no single food item.\nPlus, just because it's cake doesn't mean there's nothing good in it. There are calories and then the three macros. Depending on the cake, (a lot have fruit in them for example), then there are going to be quite a few micros as well. So it can contribute positively to an overall diet just as much as broccoli.

This despite written authorisation granting permission for such a development. Royldene homeowner Mike Louw said on Tuesday that despite the best efforts of neighbourhood residents to ensure that the park is a safe place to visit and is always kept in pristine condition, their efforts were proving to be an expensive exercise in futility as they have received little support from local government. He said that, to date, residents had forked out hundreds of thousands of rands on infrastructure and safety features. These include the erection of an electric fence, with an estimated price tag of R250 000. This development, however, ground to a halt on Tuesday when municipal officials stopped construction. \u0093About seven or eight years ago we took over the management of the park and have been covering the costs of upkeep and maintenance out of our own pockets, ever since\u0094 Louw said on Tuesday. \u0093Basically, the municipality has been supplying water but we have been financing the expenses of keeping the area neat, tidy and inviting. \u0093Sadly, we have had constant problems with people having parties out of the boots of their cars at the park, where alcohol and drugs are used without any concern for the community.\u0094 Louw said that another cause for concern was motorists who are misusing the road separating the communal property from suburban residences. \u0093We want to make it clear that we aren\u0092t trying to prevent the public from accessing the premises but rather from misusing the park,\u0094 Louw added. \u0093People will be able to gain 24-hour access to the park through a pedestrian gate but we want to be able to prevent cars from gaining access at night as this is causing major problems. \u0093Residents have tried to speak to revellers, only to be sworn at and threatened with violence and now, with the festive season approaching, things are only going to get worse.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

She was just never driven that way and would play video games and read books at home instead. \n\"I think with women, in particular, there will come a time where your metabolism starts to drop and you don't feel as young as you are used to, and when you start putting on weight in weird places that you thought you wouldn't gain weight in, that spurred me to find some kind of physical activity. \nBut I wasn't huge on anything intense so I found yoga and it turned out to be a lot more intense than I initially thought it was. \n\"We don't realise it because in pictures it just looks like you are stretching but in order for you to get into a lot of the advanced poses, there are a lot of drills and practice involved. \nThat amount of practice equates to the amount of physical work to increase your metabolic rate which then burns fat. Of course, it is not as great an option for weight loss as opposed to cardio but it does contribute to that,\" she said. \nShe honestly didn't think she would be good at her career, not until she tried it out. She gave it a shot and it turned out that she enjoyed it a lot more than she expected. She has gotten to a point where her body has gotten used to working out every day. She believed the body, like the brain, is a muscle and the more you push yourself, the better, faster and stronger you will get. \n\"But my measure of success doesn't lie in deliberately breaking my personal records all the time. I get that there are some days you don't feel up to it, I get that there are some days you will perform better than you would expect and surprise yourself, and I get that there are some days you just don't want to do it at all. That is just being human and that is fine,\" she confessed. \nAs a fitness professional, she can afford to eat what she wants as she does a lot of cardio and hence tends to burn more calories, but it is not so much about working out to eat whatever you want. The general rule is to keep your fibre and protein intake higher and cut down on sugar. \n\"I don't eat chicken because I feel it is pretty toxic to your body because of the way it is raised, cultivated, slaughtered and distributed. I just don't feel it is a very healthy meat to consume often. I will eat red meat maybe once or twice a week and then there are other meats here and there. The way I do it is I will have meat for one meal in one or two days, and the rest is plant-based,\" she added. \nAs a Spin Instructor at FlyCycle, her music is what draws people to her classes. Growing up with music, she listens to everything from rock, pop, funk, house, disco, indie, broadway and even classical and her feeling at the time really influences her choice in music for her class. She believes the vibe, energy, and ideology that she brings to class is something people can relate to and gain a fresh perspective from. \n\"Besides getting on the bike and driving ourselves to the ground, I like to to do a three-gratitude practice where you think about three things that have happened to you throughout the day that you can be grateful about. It can be any three things that pop into your head and it doesn't need to be a big thing. It could be little things that could lift your mood. \n\"That is where I try not to only be an instructor on a bike. I try to inject these little values and practices into your daily life. We are all human and we experience things at different points in our lives. I don't want to just narrow things down to just on a bike. If you are able to take away that little value and apply it to your own issues, I feel I have done a good job,\" she said. \nSo what's in it for the 26-year-old? \"A lot of people ask me this question but I am extremely horrible with commitments, and if anyone asks me if I have a five-year plan, I will tell you I still write my three-month plan in pencil. But for the near future, I definitely see myself travelling a bit more and trying new things.\" \n\"I think a very important part of my job requires me to explore different markets of fitness around the globe, especially in major cities. In any business nowadays, you need to have a fresh take on it and for me to keep my game sharp, I need to have a fresh take too. \n\"I need to find a mentor who will teach me new things, sharpen my skills and teach me to do better so I will able to share that with others. \n\"Right now I am still very happy with what I am able to do. The progression of that will be how to be a better teacher at the end of the day,\" she declared.

Grocery store will run specials on them around the holidays for around $5.00/lb. Here\u0092s my 2 favorite recipes.\nPrime Rib Roast\nSeasonings\nPepper\nGarlic salt\nChopped dried onions\nChopped dried garlic\nAu jus sauce x2\nLiquid smoke\n1-2 days before cooking, place rib roast in a baking tin and season rub with GS, pepper, dried onions and garlic. Pour in 1 bottle of au jus and a bit of liquid smoke. Put in fridge. Turn roast over every few hours as you enter the fridge. Saving the cut sides for last. The roast will slowly absord the liquid. Especially the cut sides so save them for last.\nNow I have done at least 10+ trying different methods and always heard/ read to have the roast room temp before smoking. My results show that a room temp roast will be more medium and dryer at 135 internal degree temp than a cold roast. I usually sit it out about an 1 hour before cooking. Results should be a rare/med rare roast at 135 internal temp.\nKeep smoker between 200-225. 5lb roast should take anywhere 3.5 - 4.5 hours. I start checking the internal temp at 3.5 hours at 200. Checking every 30 mins. This will give you a time estimate of when the temp hits 135. At 135, pull off the roast and rest for about 10-15 minutes. In the mean time, prepare the other au jus bottle and horseradish.\nThe roast should be a bit on the rare side which is the my preference. My wife like hers \u0093 not pink\u0094, so I cut a slice and place in a medium heat skillet for about 2-3 minutes per side. Same as a restaurant will do. Keep end pieces and scrapes. You can always freeze the left over roast and eat later.\nRecipe #2 - Prime Rib Soup\nScrapes and end/seasoning edge pieces - approx 1-2 lbs.\nAu jus sauce\nSour cream\nPlace in soup pot and add water to about to cover the meat about twice as high. Slow boil the meat until about half of the water is left and should start turning a weak coffee color. Add au jus sauce and water to about twice as high again. Slow boil until you taste a good salty base. Add 1-2 tablespoons of sour cream and the color should change to a rich brown color. Serve as is or over white rice. Awesome and hearty soup for cold days.\nEnjoy!\nGreatest first post ever.

While the app is available in 17 countries already, there\u2019s support for over 21 languages offered through it. \n\u201cOur products are highly emotional vehicles which customers need to experience ,\u201d said Andrea Castronovo, BMW Group Vice President, Customer Centric Sales Strategy, MPM & Process Management. \u201c With this app, we\u2019re able to bring the next best thing to an actual product into people\u2019s pockets \u2013 they can just take out their iPhone and see what their dream car would look like on the driveway or how it would fit into their garage, \u201d he added. \nJust for a reminder, last month BMW became first company to experiment with Snapchat\u2019s AR ads. In an attempt to turn things around, Snapchat is turning to augmented reality advertisements. The first of these AR ads will come courtesy of BMW. In the case of BMW\u2019s new X2, the app will project an image of the car into the world around you. Users will be able to walk around the car and tap it to change its paint job. \nThere are several automakers who are seeing a potential for augmented reality to complement their retail experience with the ability to see a vehicle virtually anywhere and explore it in detail while being able to change its configuration at the touch of a screen. For example, we saw some early examples of this kind of functionality soon after ARKit was first announced, most notably in the form of a virtual Tesla created by an independent developer. But this is a real application of ARKit produced by a major automaker, and it seems BMW is, once again, ahead of them.

But let's dig a little deeper.\nI collect evil black guns. The only blue and wood gun I think I own is a Winchester 101 20g for bird hunting.\nWhen I decided to go hog hunting, my big question was, what should I take?\nThe guys that went with me, were as new to hog hunting as I was. We were going somewhere we had never been, to shoot something, we had never seen. Piece of cake. Hmmm, what should I take?\nHave a question? Consult YouTube. I have watched so many videos of hog hunting, that I feel like I know Todd Huey personally. BTW, the boy is getting big Todd.\nI have seen videos of hogs being shot with everything from .22 rim fires to .50 BMG. It didn't help. I left there with a desire to buy a .50 BMG.\nMy big dilemma was, I can't suppress a .30 caliber rifle. I screwed up and bought a 5.56 can instead of .30 cal, years ago. That rules out buying a \"proper\" hog killing gun, before the trip.\nHere's where I embarrass myself. I filled out my 5320 form and brought 3 SBRs, 2 full size ARs, a .308 bolt gun, and only god knows how many pistols for a four day hunt.\nIn the end, I shot pigs with two guns. The 16\" Colt with the thermal, and the 10.3\" Colt with a Aimpoint. The little Colt was for walking up to them after they were down. Hey, I'm from Indiana, I was a little nervous. We don't have 200 pound German Shepards running loose up here, that want to eat your ass!\nI brought an HK UMP in .45acp, thinking, hey, we will be in stands, it will be perfect for 50 yards. My first pig was from a stand at 50-60 yards, in daylight, but I brought the thermal that night. The following two nights, I brought the HK, but saw nothing before the sun set.\nIt's my one regret.
