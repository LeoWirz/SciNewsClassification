Activation of the IFN-\u03b3 and its downstream interleukin-12 (IL-12) pathway can correct these diseases. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is a cytokine signaling inhibitor that blocks downstream pathways of IFN-\u03b3 by blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathways. Oxymatrine (OMT), a quinolizidine alkaloid extracted from the herbal medicine Radix Sophorae flavescentis , is used to treat allergic skin diseases in China. The non-cytotoxic concentrations of OMT in HaCaT cells were determined through 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 were used to stimulate HaCaT cells, and OMT was added to this system with tacrolimus (FK506) as a positive control. The mRNAs of cytokines, MDC, ICAM-1, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, and IFN-\u03b3 receptor (IFN-\u03b3R)\u03b1 were detected by RT-PCR. Western blot analyses were performed to assess activation of the MAPK (p38, Jun N-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and Akt signaling pathways. OMT increased the mRNA levels of the IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3R\u03b1, reduced the mRNA levels of ICAM-1, MDC, and SOCS1. But FK506 increased the mRNA levels of IL12 and inhibited the expression of ICAM-1 mRNAs and had no effects on the IFN-\u03b3R\u03b1, MDC, and SOCS1 mRNA in HaCaT cells stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. Thus, the mechanisms through which OMT and FK506 ameliorate allergic skin diseases differ.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2BHtnOL", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "downregulates mdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mdc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:30.074+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61abc65ac52498f7cb4f79f8a45f8ea74b42b39e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS76VDaDFrrEZfSg47lFq8qPXBVcIHVr9Y8Vhh_35NwoBj5WG9gtb3mh05tRK0sSoXPYch02XAKLatjWSgosKuzy3zVAXUZNuYFnHdaVXg66SgfJnVIPS99kcRjaO7aWQKZdna2_YWDPnW4yBslf0SoO.qWMrPBgziP8O.LYiKSgwTDZp0SDnJdneq6hukqzcg-", "site_full": "www.prnewswire.com", "site": "prnewswire.com", "site_section": "http://rss.prnewswire.com/subject/sri/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "PR Newswire:", "title": "OPAP and INTRALOT Extend Their Partnership for the Numerical Lottery Products and Services", "title_full": "OPAP and INTRALOT Extend Their Partnership for the Numerical Lottery Products and Services", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/616819/OPAP_and_INTRALOT_Extend_Partnership.jpg?p=facebook", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3190, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "61abc65ac52498f7cb4f79f8a45f8ea74b42b39e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS76VDaDFrrEZfSg47lFq8qPXBVcIHVr9Y8Vhh_35NwoBj5WG9gtb3mh05tRK0sSoXPYch02XAKLatjWSgosKuzy3zVAXUZNuYFnHdaVXg66SgfJnVIPS99kcRjaO7aWQKZdna2_YWDPnW4yBslf0SoO.qWMrPBgziP8O.LYiKSgwTDZp0SDnJdneq6hukqzcg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "INTRALOT", "published": "2017-12-07T11:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "OPAP and INTRALOT Extend Their Partnership for the Numerical Lottery Products and Services", "text": "ATHENS, Greece , December 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --\nOPAP and INTRALOT extend their partnership for the numerical lottery products and services (PRNewsfoto/INTRALOT) OPAP Group (OPAP), the leading Greek betting and lottery operator and INTRALOT, a leading global gaming solutions provider, have agreed on the extension of their cooperation in the field of numerical lotteries and services with the signing of a new three-year contract that also includes an option for OPAP to renew for an additional two years.

The Wazirin Adamawa was one of the founders of the PDP, but also helped to bring the party down to its knees, when he led a walkout at the PDP Convention. That walkout was to trigger a chain of events that culminated in the defeat of the party in the 2015 presidential election. But politicians will tell you that there are no permanent friends or enemies in politics, only permanent interests. So whatever sins Atiku might have committed against the party have been forgiven. For Atiku, the issues that led to his walking out on the party have also been resolved. All is well that ends well! So what should we expect now that the speculations are over, and Atiku has finally re-joined the PDP? One, Atiku\u2019s decampment has created a new excitement around the PDP. But that excitement is still muted as the outcome of the party\u2019s convention to elect its national Chairman this weekend will largely determine whether the party will be effectively rebranded as a viable alternative to the ruling APC or not.  Atiku\u2019s decampment may not trigger a \u2018moving train narrative\u2019 in the short term, even from people who may otherwise want to move. The reason is simple: Buhari generates the fear factor perhaps more than any other Nigerian leader. This fear factor will ensure that politically exposed persons who may want to move, will have to factor in the fact that the Buhari is not Jonathan, and that there may be immediate consequences for any embarrassment. However if the PDP convention goes on well, and its brand value continues to be enhanced, including with a few more strong willed politicians joining its fold, the threshold at which the fear factor around Buhari will be broken will be reached quickly. Atiku may in fact have started the process of breaking that fear factor around Buhari.  It is debatable whether there is another presidential candidate from the North who will have Atiku\u2019s boldness in calling out Buhari and the APC. In fact the suspected fear among such potential presidential aspirants \u2013 both in the APC and the PDP \u2013 might have emboldened Fayose to declare his interest in running \u2013 when his party the PDP had zoned the post to the North.   It a testimony to his courage that Atiku decamped and called out both Buhari and the APC despite the challenge his company Intels is having with the government. Several other candidates would have been browbeaten into line by the move on Intels. Two, one of the expectations from the decampment is a flurry of attacks on Atiku (to make it seem like a good riddance to bad rubbish) and a vigorous defence of him by his loyalists and media team. Sometimes this is a deliberate strategy by politicians who have been in the game for too long.  By decamping and calling out on the APC (rather than departing quietly), Atiku may be luring them to bring out all the arsenals and allegations against him \u2013 founded and unfounded- into the public domain so they will be vigorously interrogated and countenanced. In this offensive-defensive strategy, victory for Atiku and his loyalists will be measured by whether the generality of the citizens will regard those allegations as stale news or not weighty enough by the time of PDP\u2019s primaries.  For the Buhari team, victory is measured if they succeed in making it stick with the public that Atiku is a \u2018damaged good\u2019. Three, the fear factor, which Buhari generates, and which may stem in the short term massive decampments from the APC, gives Buhari and his party an elbow room to make adjustments to prevent Atiku\u2019s departure from triggering a bandwagon effect. But this opportunity, if seized by both Buhari and the APC, will have a price tag: a big part of Buhari\u2019s appeal to his supporters is that he is not seen as   a \u2018traditional\u2019 politician who revels in the \u2018little lies people call diplomacy\u2019.  His supporters say the Daura General \u2018says it as he sees or feels it\u2019. Based on this, if Buhari goes on a charm offensive  to woo   party members and others  disaffected by his government,  he will be seen as acting in the mould of traditional politicians \u2013 a big detraction from his unique marketing point.  It will also remain an open question whether those he wants to woo with such charm offensives will genuinely trust him or merely pretend to do so while biding their time to exert their revenge. Four, a very important thing to note in the current buzz around Atiku\u2019s decampment is that it is too early to know how it will affect the fortunes of the PDP, the APC and Atiku himself. We are still in the first minute of a 90-minute game. There is still almost a year to the PDP\u2019s presidential primaries.  The buzz will eventually settle. A month is like a life time in politics, not to talk of a year. There are just too many intervening variables in life that no one knows how they will play out. None of us for instance knows whether we can live to see the outcome of the PDP primaries, whether there will be illnesses and some rushed to hospitals or even die and whether there will be new forces who will emerge to change the entire political landscape. Therefore the current bounce from Atiku\u2019s decampment can be likened to the Transformation Ambassadors of Nigeria (TAN) which once dominated the political landscape and made it seem that Jonathan had already secured a second term \u2013 until the APC elected Buhari as its party bearer without the party fracturing as feared, and the real power works began. The unknowable intervening variables can work in favour or disfavour of Atiku, the APC or the PDP. Five, one of the things that may work in Buhari\u2019s favour is the unwritten convention that the presidency should rotate between the North and the South for a period of eight years each. Some politicians from the south may calculate that if Buhari is allowed to complete another four years, power would return to the south earlier than under a PDP government, which will take another eight years for power to shift to the south. A PDP presidential candidate may of course promise to do just a single term of four years and hope that the voters will trust him to keep his word. Six, who will win between Buhari and Atiku in a hypothetical match-up? Largely because contexts and circumstances influence the outcome of elections, the outcome of any contest between the two in the past \u2013 whether direct or by proxy- will be irrelevant in judging such a hypothetical contest.  It will be akin to arguing that because team A beat team B three consecutive times in the past, team A is then sure of a repeat performance in a fourth encounter. If the indices used in determining the outcome of such a hypothetical election are communication skills, preparedness for the job, cosmopolitanism, possession of vast networks across the country and   ability to grow the economy, I think it will be a no-contest as Atiku will clearly win on all the counts. But democracy anywhere in the world is not driven by logical principles and precepts.  It is one of the reasons some call it \u2018mobo-cracy\u2019 or \u2018mob rule\u2019 because elections only guarantee that the most popular, not the best candidate should win. And the factors that determine a candidate\u2019s popularity are largely driven by emotions and non-logical impulses. Therefore in such a hypothetical contest, issues like ability to \u2018perform\u2019 and deliver will be subjective, and therefore almost irrelevant in determining its outcome. Supporters will find a thousand reasons why Buhari has performed creditably while his critics will also find 1000 reasons why he has performed woefully. The emotional reasons that will decide the elections are likely to be wrapped around the following questions: Does Buhari still command the sort of following he had in the North-east and North-west  which ensured that he consistently got some 12 million votes in his three unsuccessful runs for the presidency? Atiku\u2019s embrace of \u2018restructuring\u2019 may have endeared him to restructuring activists in the South. But will the number of votes from the South on account of that compensate for any loss of votes by people from the North who may regard his embrace of restructuring (opposed largely by the North) as either opportunistic or a sell-out? Atiku has not been a darling of the Northern \u2018talakawas\u2019 \u2013 at least not in the same way that Buhari has been. Will circumstances create a coalition that will help him override that deficit in the North \u2013 just as circumstances created a coalition for Buhar that helped to overcome some of his negative perceptions in the South?

Received: 27 October 2017 / Revised: 26 November 2017 / Accepted: 3 December 2017 / Published: 7 December 2017 No Abstract State monitoring is very important for the safe operation of high-voltage transformers. A non-contact vibro-acoustic detection method based on the Blind Source Separation (BSS) was proposed in this paper to promote the development of transformer on-line monitoring technology. Firstly, the algorithm of Sparse Component Analysis (SCA) was applied for the adaptive extraction of vibro-acoustic signals, which utilizes the sorted local maximum values of the potential function. Then, the operating states of the transformer were detected by analyzing the vibro-acoustic signal eigenvectors. Different conditions including running normally, increasing of transformer vibro-acoustic amplitude and changing of frequency component of transformer vibro-acoustic were simulated. Moreover, experiments were carried out in a 220 kV substation. The research results show that the number of mixed noise sources can be estimated and the transformer vibro-acoustic signal was always ranked first in the separation signals. The source signals were effectively separated from the mixed signals while all of the correlation coefficients are more than 0.98 and the quadratic residuals are less than \u221232 dB. As for the experiments, the vibro-acoustic signal was separated out successfully from two voice signals and two interference signals. The acoustic signal reflection is considered as the main cause of the signal interference, and the transformer volume source model is considered as the main reason of unstable vibro-acoustic signal amplitude. Finally, the simulated abnormal states of the transformer were well recognized and the state of the tested transformer was judged to be normal.

interventions for pediatric chronic pain include cognitive-behavioral (CBT), acceptance and commitment (ACT), and family-based therapies, though literature regarding multi-family therapy (MFT) is sparse. This investigation examined the utility and outcomes of the Courage to Act with Pain: Teens Identifying Values, Acceptance, and Treatment Effects (CAPTIVATE) program, which included all three modalities (CBT, ACT, MFT) for youth with chronic pain and their parents. Program utility, engagement, and satisfaction were evaluated via quantitative and qualitative feedback. Pain-specific psychological, behavioral, and interpersonal processes were examined along with outcomes related to disability, quality of life, pain interference, fatigue, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Participants indicated that CAPTIVATE was constructive, engaging, and helpful for social and family systems. Clinical and statistical improvements with large effect sizes were captured for pain catastrophizing, acceptance, and protective parenting but not family functioning. Similar effects were found for functional disability, pain interference, fatigue, anxiety, and depression. Given the importance of targeting multiple systems in the management of pediatric chronic pain, preliminary findings suggest a potential new group-based treatment option for youth and families. Next steps involve evaluating the differential effect of the program over treatment as usual, as well as specific CBT, ACT, and MFT components and processes that may affect outcomes.

Our previous paper showed that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) played a crucial role in L-selectin- and PSGL-1-mediated F-actin redistribution and assembly during neutrophil rolling on E-selectin. However, it is not clear whether L-selectin and PSGL-1 induce other similar physiology events by PI3K. Here, we investigated the possibility of PI3K linking the signaling pathways of L-selectin and PSGL-1 to IL-18 transcription. We first demonstrated that L-selectin and PSGL-1 stimulation upregulated IL-18 transcription level in Jurkat cells. Then we found that PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reduced L-selectin- and PSGL-1-induced mRNA upregulation of IL-18 in Jurkat cells. Transfection of phosphatase and tensin homolog expressing plasmid inhibited the transcription level of IL-18. Therefore, PI3K is a signal linker between L-selectin and PSGL-1 in IL-18 transcriptional activation at the promoter level. To our knowledge, this is the first time to directly link PI3K to L-selectin- and PSGL-1-mediated IL-18 transcription, providing a foundation for intervention of PI3K-related inflammation.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2iys6lu", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "jurkat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:46:32.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad775861757e8d5a8a3323ed07116d00b35c99c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9hgmepZ8a06nX5GO68UbxqgAk4LN_6vb.8wlIH94ZGNIXH1xP0WG4eWyb_g9dr.9.o6WHzOQsgKGkhEAKiwJV0APuGu5s2dyOF5zoyLpK_3j4_CXgTNpbF_zyqwAdFjZ9.VhJ6DqGBfRwlvl2GjquakH58PQBJEGDwxAARSUhlRWVVsT7XR4jjyzYV2hjEXk2N8DuYjjMjGu3669E7JBIS2MnWklwNw07Rbs5gAdpz75kfwe3i09kMwcfD4c2Lh7vvSkwQFOV9GvPYvLkeNxbC0E8xFP698dSkEjxZYIvUx4JfGqqtZ0JHncmGy0STQ_s-", "site_full": "www.fark.com", "site": "fark.com", "site_section": "http://www.fark.com/entertainment/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FARK.com: Entertainment links", "title": "(9830008) Trumpy and Bibi are trying to kick off armageddon, the Tax Fraud bill is stalled out, the Silence Breakers are the people of the year and WHAT THE %^&$ DO YOU MEAN IT'S ONLY WED??

Obviously there was a caveat in the draft that precluded individuals from the draft if there were in religious service. So are they trying to say that an individual should give up their service to God to serve their country? So then they are ridiculing an individual for choosing God over Country? Was Romney still eligible for the draft after he came home? \nThis accusation is ridiculous, and to show contempt to Romney's sons for not serving is equally ridiculous!

If memory serves me right, the answer was something akin to \"multiple Jerobohams\" of wine...\nThe rumors of Andre's alcohol tolerance are pretty much true. One night, after a show in Reno, I watched him drink 12 bottles of red wine and a fifth of vodka while relaxing in a mineral spa.

If memory serves me right, the answer was something akin to \"multiple Jerobohams\" of wine...\nThe rumors of Andre's alcohol tolerance are pretty much true. One night, after a show in Reno, I watched him drink 12 bottles of red wine and a fifth of vodka while relaxing in a mineral spa. Andre loved animals and was thrilled when we worked my hand raised bobcat, Fluffy, into his persona as a giant stuck with his niece and his cat in a land of little people (think Gulliver's Travels). The bonus was since I drove a motorhome on the tour (office on wheels), this gave Andre a place to actually stretch out while on the road. He would lay down and Fluffy would curl up with him. Their snoring easily drowned out my tape player.\nWelp, it is over folks. If anyone has a CSB they can promptly shove off.\nAndre the Giant + cat story will forever trump it all.\nPraise Cheetus wins the internet.\nNot being sarcastic. Knowing Fezzik wins.\nAndre's characterization of Fezzik was actually based on the fellow that watched over me for many years, at the behest of my grandfather. Joey was a former Golden Gloves champ from Brooklyn. Joey was about 6' tall and built like a brick wall. When he saw Ric Flair put a hand on my ass as a group of us headed to cars for dinner at our favorite restaurant (we had access to a closed room through an entrance that did not go through the dining room, so the whole crew could hang out without breaking kayfabe), Joey picked Ric up by his belt and collar and toss him into the trunk of the Cadillac.
