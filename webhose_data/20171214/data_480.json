Nye", "published": "2017-12-07T06:10:00.000+02:00", "title": "Understanding the North Korea threat", "text": "With Images Without Images \nNorth Korea recently tested its Hwasong-15 ballistic missile, reaching an altitude of 2,780 miles (4,475 kilometers) during its 53-minute flight. Using a flatter trajectory could provide Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime with the capability of hitting the east coast of the United States. Although it has not yet demonstrated a re-entry vehicle capable of surviving atmospheric friction, North Korea announced that it has mastered nuclear strike capability and become a full-fledged nuclear state. \nLike previous US presidents, Donald Trump has said that this state of affairs is intolerable. So now what? \nBefore turning to policy, it is important to dispose of several myths that interfere with clear analysis. First, Kim may be a vicious dictator, but he is not crazy or suicidal. Thus far, he has outplayed the US in this high-stakes game, but he understands that a nuclear exchange with the US means the end of the regime he is trying to preserve. \nSecond, the US has talked itself into Kim\u2019s trap of exaggerating how much power his rocketry gives him. After all, North Korea has had nuclear weapons for more than a decade; they could be delivered to US ports on its east or west coast by other means, such as in the hold of a freighter. \nThird, in this game of bluff and chicken, geography provides North Korea with local escalation dominance. With thousands of artillery tubes hidden in tunnels near the border, North Korea can threaten to wreak havoc on Seoul, South Korea\u2019s nearby capital, by conventional means. The US found this out in 1994\u2014long before North Korea had a nuclear weapon\u2014when it planned a pre-emptive strike to destroy the North\u2019s Yongbyon plutonium reprocessing plant, only to find that its allies in South Korea (and Japan) were deterred by the risk of conventional retaliation. \nIn terms of policy, China has proposed \u2018a freeze for a freeze\u2019 as a means to control the North\u2019s nuclear ambitions. North Korea would halt all nuclear and missile tests (easily verifiable); while that would not reverse the North\u2019s nuclear status, it would slow the development of its arsenal. In turn, the US would halt the annual military exercises that it conducts with South Korea. The US would reserve the right to resume exercises if North Korea violated its test ban, or exported nuclear materials. \nSome see this as a good deal, but it depends on how one assesses Kim\u2019s objectives. If all he wants is security, we could leave him alone, perhaps sign a peace treaty, relax sanctions, and let economic growth change the regime over time, as in China. \nBut North Korea under the Kim dynasty is not a status quo power. Since 1945, it has been an oddity: a hereditary communist dictatorship whose legitimacy rests on its claim to be the vanguard of Korean nationalism. Thus far, it has fallen behind in the economic competition with the South, but it hopes its nuclear status will change the balance. \nAs Sung-Yoon Lee of Tufts University recently warned , \u2018for the North, menacing the US is a non-negotiable means of isolating and exercising dominance over Seoul. This is how the regime of Kim Jong-un seeks to ensure its long-term survival.\u2019 \nIf weakening the ties between the US and South Korea is central to Kim\u2019s strategy, China\u2019s freeze-for-freeze proposal plays into his hands. And, rather than reduce risks, it may embolden the North to return to risky conventional pressure on South Korea, such as in 2010, when it sank a South Korean corvette, killing 46 seamen, and shelled South Korean islands. \nUS policy options are limited. One is the limited use of force. Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, has been quoted on several occasions saying a preventive war may be necessary if diplomacy fails. But even if designed as a limited strike, would a decapitation effort or missile shoot-down remain limited? If not, casualties could range from the tens of thousands to much higher numbers. \nSanctions continue to be an option, but thus far they have not generated enough pressure to make the Kim regime give up what it regards as its key strategic asset. Chinese diplomacy and sanctions are also crucial, but thus far China has pulled its punches. It has not cut off food and fuel. China does not like Kim, but it does not want chaos\u2014or Americans\u2014on its border. \nA possible package could be something like Cold War \u2018GRIT\u2019, or gradual reduction of international tension: The US assures China of its limited goals and agrees to coordinate its actions with the Chinese. No more marches to the Yalu River of the sort that triggered China\u2019s intervention in the Korean War. In return, China uses its economic pressure and diplomacy to freeze the immediate threat posed by North Korean tests, but does not insist on a freeze on US forces. \nPossible scaling back of US exercises in the future would depend on North Korean behaviour towards South Korea. The US would offer to negotiate a peace treaty after North Korea accepts d\u00e9tente with South Korea. The US and China would accept North Korea\u2019s de facto nuclear status, but jointly reaffirm their long-term objective of a nuclear-free peninsula. North Korea agrees to stop tests and all further exports of nuclear materials. China threatens to impose food and fuel sanctions if North Korea cheats or breaks the agreement. \nThe prospects for such a China-centred package are not high; but if it fails, the US should not panic. If it could deter a much stronger Soviet Union from taking an isolated West Berlin for three decades, it can deter North Korea. The US should reinforce its deterrent and defence capability through its alliances with South Korea and Japan. The presence of nearly 50,000 US troops in Japan, and some 28,000 in Korea, makes extended deterrence credible. Kim cannot kill South Koreans or Japanese without killing Americans, and that, as he surely knows, would mean the end of his regime. Author \nJoseph S.

There will eventually be Consequences, including War in the Middle East regarding this etc. etc. Even Jacob's Trouble will eventually set in at an Opportune and set Time. \nRemember, it is All about The Messiah Jesus Christ.

The end of it shall be with a flood, And till the end of the war desolations are determined.\u201d\u2019 \nMathew 23: 37-39 \u2018\u201cO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her!

Ask now, and see, Whether a man is ever in labor with child? So why do I see every man with his hands on his loins Like a woman in labor, And all faces turned pale? Alas! For that day is great, So that none is like it; And it is the time of Jacob\u2019s trouble, But he shall be saved out of it. \u2018For it shall come to pass in that day,\u2019 Says The LORD of hosts, \u2018That I will break his yoke from your neck, And will burst your bonds; Foreigners shall no more enslave them. But they shall serve The LORD their God, And David their king, Whom I will raise up for them. \u2018Therefore do not fear, O My servant Jacob,\u2019 says The LORD, \u2018Nor be dismayed, O Israel; For behold, I will save you from afar, And your seed from the land of their captivity. Jacob shall return, have rest and be quiet, And no one shall make him afraid. For I am with you,\u2019 says The LORD, \u2018to save you; Though I make a full end of all nations where I have scattered you, Yet I will not make a complete end of you.

Andromeda aimed to spread malware to other computers. A suspect was arrested in Belarus. \nSouth Sudan taking on crime \nThe world\u2019s youngest country aims to improve security in its capital. South Sudanese officials launched a CCTV and drone system , with 11 cameras and two drones, and more to come. The country\u2019s president, Salva Kiir, promises that \u2018those who snatch things \u2026 can now be traced\u2019. Israeli company Global Group installed the system, which is costing the impoverished state millions of dollars. The plan is for 150 local police officers to take over management eventually. \nNigeria reacts to police brutality \nNigeria is also taking action against robbery, although in a different manner. Following an online campaign calling for its disbandment, the inspector general of the police announced the re-organisation of the national special anti-robbery squad , while a Senate committee will investigate allegations of brutality. People had complained about \u2018arbitrary arrests, detention without charge and violent threats\u2019 . Initially, the police threatened the leader of the campaign; now the force is calling for the public to submit complaints. \nCT scan \nDeath of Yemeni ex-president \nAli Abdullah Saleh, an ex-president of Yemen was killed on Monday by Houthi rebels in fighting sparked by his \u2018betrayal and treason\u2019 . Saleh was a politician of \u2018charisma, duplicity and brute force\u2019 who had ruled Yemen for over 30 years before being deposed in 2012 and returned to prominence after siding with the Houthis in Yemen\u2019s civil war. The Iran-backed Houthis killed Saleh after he publicly advocated talks with Saudi Arabia. The death is expected to deepen the already horrific conflict. \nBritish intelligence report \nBritain\u2019s MI5 and police force have released a report assessing their response to terror attacks in London and Manchester. The report says that the Manchester attack could have been averted \u2018 had the cards fallen differently \u2019. Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, told cabinet that MI5 had thwarted nine terrorist attacks in the past year, but that five had gotten through. \nChinese Twitter surveillance \nChinese anti-terrorism official Mei Jianming announced that China has been tracking and analysing social media accounts in Australia connected to Islamic terrorism. Mei said the analysis showed that Islamist terrorists were \u2018collaborating with other anti-Chinese forces\u2019. Three Australian Uyghur community associations were among those tracked. \nCheck point \nThird time lucky for Trump\u2019s travel ban \nThe US Supreme Court has given legal sanction to Donald Trump\u2019s amended travel ban after two earlier versions met legal obstacles earlier this year. The latest version of the ban will prevent people from Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Chad, North Korea and Iran, and government officials from Venezuela, from entering the US. Despite the ruling, the ban still faces ongoing legal challenges. \nBrexit border headache \nTheresa May\u2019s leadership has again been called into question after she failed to negotiate a border agreement between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, Arlene Foster, reportedly led the charge to block the deal. Northern Ireland\u2019s 500-kilometre border with the Republic of Ireland is the subject of much of the controversy. \nIndia\u2013Pakistan diplomatic struggles contribute to border hazards \nBorder dwellers on the line of control (LoC) between India and Pakistan remain under constant threat . Close to 70,000 people live within 5 kilometres of the LoC on the Indian side. Pakistani bombardments often force them to relocate. The Assistant Commissioner in Rajouri, a town on the LoC, has said that his administration has built 20 bunkers to protect civilians, and will have an additional 20 completed before the end of the year. \nFirst responder \nInternet of things helping first responders \nThe Harvard Business Review has published an article on how the internet of things (IoT) might help first responders deal with emergencies . IoT sensors can collect and broadcast data about temperature, water quality, pressure and smoke, allowing better decision-making. The IoT could also help residents make better decisions about when to stay and when to evacuate. \nGuide to urban resilience \nThe International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have launched a guide to urban resilience with the Red Crescent Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The 103-page document explains what urban resilience is and how governments can improve it. \nResilience or austerity \nAccording to Sotriria Theodoropoulou of the London School of Economics , the European Commission is focusing increasingly on \u2018economic resilience\u2019 as a priority, particularly the ability to absorb shocks. The EC counsels member states to enact austerity policies and shrink their current account deficits. Not so fast, says the author: placing the onus solely on member states while ignoring the shortcomings of EU institutions could \u2018lead to further divisions\u2019 among Eurozone members. The shadow of the 2008 sovereign debt crisis still looms large over Europe. Author \nJacqueline Westermann , Jack Viola , Eliza Chapman and Harley Comrie are research interns at ASPI.

I did them both in an afternoon and certainly saw everything they have to offer and I'm the kind of person that reads everything possible. They are very close together.\nDistrict 5 is fantastic for food as it includes the city's China Town. Food is usually great all over but the variety and quality in D5 is without doubt the best. Unless you want fantastic 'western' food, which is located almost exclusively in D1 and D2.\nThe Cu Chi tunnels are really not that great. I've been twice with two different tour companies and both times the whole experience was very underwhelming. I understand the appeal however it is a full day's trip and in my mind, not worth it at all.\nA trip up the city's tallest building, Bitexco, is a great way to see fantastic views of the city. You DO NOT need to pay to go up there and the drink's are very reasonably priced given the setting. It's best to go at around 16:30/17:00 so that you can watch the sunset.\nOne of the best restaurants in the city, for me, is Den Long on Nguyen Trai in District 1. I've been multiple times and it never disappoints. Excellent food, excellent service and great prices. Definitely not to be missed.\nA visit to Ben Thanh market should be replaced with a visit to Cho Lon or any of the city's other large markets.\nA trip to walking street (Nguyen Hue) in D1 should also be on the cards. Best to go in the evening as there is always a lot going on. There are also lots of great restaurants and bars in the area too. 'The Long' is a lovely restaurant with outside seating and 'Broma' is a lovely little cocktail bar located on a rooftop terrace.\nOther great places to eat and drink are: Bep Me In, Pizza 4Ps, Pendolasco, Stoker's Woodfired Grill and Bar.\nHave a great trip!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:06.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f2e70ca52942abdcbecd6eaf793c7e465474b9f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Fsl59LiHyHLe_huI1WvSwCKCuWCsjKWHCPFkCzruaSeWR9bx1aMHbHK3wY9scVrlVYuK3wCgPuA--", "site_full": "www.travbuddy.com", "site": "travbuddy.com", "site_section": "http://www.travbuddy.com/forums/viewforum.php?id=9", "site_categories": ["travel"], "section_title": "Asia - North East &amp; South East - Travel Forums - TravBuddy ", "title": "Ho Chi Minh City", "title_full": "Ho Chi Minh City - Travel Forums - TravBuddy", "published": "2017-10-03T16:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 50616, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a2c00dc1b5c7c3e0285da3f24c296550c1f5e2a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Fsl59LiHyHLe_huI1WvSwCKCuWCsjKWHCPFkCzruaSeWR9bx1aMHbHK3wY9scVrlosn95OiRiLmw_r8wTYCOT", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "linhdt", "published": "2017-11-25T07:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "there are a lot of places hanging out in HCMC, Duc Ba church, Independent Museum, Nha Rong Harbour, Cu Chi Tunnel or Thanh An island )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:06.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "16580d8947f177a32ad15b7d9e7f136692232d51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS9muNgtOpugXWubDEXUQs00-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "16580d8947f177a32ad15b7d9e7f136692232d51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS9muNgtOpugXWubDEXUQs00-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\ue134", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:06.073+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b824fcc0747eb9e296b7e9c0619bb58a9067d69e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm0Fa4f_bvw44MtB5cCwEFHn", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=lake%20placid", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "lake%20placid News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "Trump makes remarks before congressional leadership meeting Video - ABC News", "title_full": "Trump makes remarks before congressional leadership meeting Video - ABC News : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-11-29T03:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b824fcc0747eb9e296b7e9c0619bb58a9067d69e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm0Fa4f_bvw44MtB5cCwEFHn", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABC News", "published": "2017-11-29T03:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "Trump makes remarks before congressional leadership meeting Video - ABC News", "text": "Everybody thinks is taking this yearning BC on jobs and keep you won't cite White House correspondent terror pulmonary.

The jailed leader of Turkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish opposition was remanded in prison for at least two more months on Thursday at the opening of his trial on terrorism-related charges. Supporters of Selahattin Demirtas, the jailed leader of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), wait in front of a court house as he went on trial, 13 months after his arrest on terrorism-related charges, in Ankara, Turkey, December 7, 2017. REUTERS/Umit Bektas Selahattin Demirtas, the co-leader of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (HDP) who has already been in detention more than a year, was not allowed to appear in court for security reasons and refused to take part via video link. The former human rights lawyer faces up to 142 years in prison in a case closely watched by rights groups and Western governments. The judge ruled he should be kept in detention until the next hearing on Feb 14. \u201cThis trial bears all the hallmarks of a theatre play. It\u2019s clear that this case was brought on orders. We demand an immediate end to this injustice,\u201d HDP quoted one of Demirtas\u2019 lawyers as telling the court. The court ruled that Demirtas be kept in jail, in line with the prosecutor\u2019s demand. Demirtas was arrested on Nov. 4 last year, one of more than a dozen HDP lawmakers who were detained in a crackdown following last year\u2019s attempted coup. A crowd of several hundred gathered to show support for Demirtas in snowy weather outside the court near the capital Ankara. They joined hands and danced around small fires, singing songs in Kurdish. \u201cDemirtas is our honour,\u201d they chanted. Demirtas and other detained HDP members are mostly accused of links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group, which has conducted a decades-old insurgency in which 40,000 people have been killed. The group is deemed a terrorist organisation by the United States, Turkey and Europe. All of the accused deny the charges. Supporters of Selahattin Demirtas, the jailed leader of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), wait in front of a court house as he went on trial, 13 months after his arrest on terrorism-related charges, in Ankara, Turkey, December 7, 2017. REUTERS/Umit Bektas The HDP is the third-largest party in Turkey\u2019s parliament. The party\u2019s other co-leader, Figen Yuksekdag, also jailed pending trial on terrorism charges, was remanded in custody by an Ankara court on Wednesday. PROTESTS BANNED Demirtas is held in a jail in the northwestern city of Edirne. The case was to be held within the city of Ankara itself but was moved to the Sincan prison complex outside the capital, two days before the trial, because of security concerns. European parliamentarians, Western diplomats and rights group representatives attended the session in the small court room with a capacity of 120 people. The HDP said 1,250 lawyers sought to defend Demirtas. The HDP said in a statement the indictment largely consists of press releases and speeches Demirtas has made at conferences, panels and similar legal and political activities. The charges aimed at Demirtas included \u201cestablishing a terrorist organisation\u201d, \u201cspreading terror group propaganda\u201d and \u201cpraising crimes and criminals\u201d. Authorities banned protests across Ankara province for the three days until Friday for security reasons after the HDP called for protests to mark the hearing of Demirtas and other party officials, the governor\u2019s office said in a statement. About 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended and roughly 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial since last year\u2019s failed coup. Rights groups and some Western allies say Erdogan has used the putsch as an excuse to quash dissent. The HDP says as many as 5,000 of its members have been detained. Erdogan says such measures were necessary given the danger represented by the putsch in which 250 people were killed.

A home affairs department is being established to act as a \u2018portfolio agency\u2019 for ASIO, the AFP, the Australian Border Force, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, AUSTRAC and the Office of Transport Security. We\u2019re also getting a new Office of National Intelligence (maybe better badged as the Office of Surprise Management), headed by a director-general who will be the prime minister\u2019s principal adviser on matters relating to the national intelligence community. \nBut one national security development has largely flown under the radar. In January, a Critical Infrastructure Centre was set up in the Attorney-General\u2019s Department to assess the risk of sabotage, espionage and coercion on telecommunications, electricity, water and maritime ports arising from foreign involvement in those sectors. \nWhile media attention has been elsewhere, there\u2019s been a flurry of legislation\u2014newly enacted, drafts released for comment, and new pieces to be put before parliament\u2014all with relevance to the new centre. \nOne of those is a recently released draft bill on the security of critical infrastructure. It aims to strengthen the government\u2019s capacity to manage the national security issues that arise from foreign ownership of key categories of infrastructure, while minimising the regulatory impact and maintaining an open investment policy. \nThe bill provides for two central measures. The first is the development of a register of critical infrastructure assets covering maritime ports, electricity and water in the states and territories. Owners and operators will be required to provide information about the groups and individuals that have a direct interest (legal, equitable, lease or licensing) in an asset, including the level of control they have over the asset. \nThe second measure provides for a federal minister to issue a \u2018last resort\u2019 directive to the owner or operator of a critical asset if security vulnerabilities are detected and aren\u2019t corrected or if there are no existing regulatory frameworks that can be used to enforce risk mitigation. Unaddressed vulnerabilities such as gaps in the quality of institutional security policies (including data and physical security); the effectiveness of security audit regimes; and the adequacy of emergency management plans, regulatory regimes and control systems may be the sorts of conditions that would trigger a \u2018last resort\u2019 directive. \nIn addition, last month the government passed legislation that will oblige telecommunications service providers and intermediaries to protect the networks and facilities they own, operate or use from unauthorised interference or access. The aim is to ensure the availability and integrity of facilities and their control networks, and so protect the confidentiality of information stored in or carried on them. \nAllied with the protective focus of these legislative steps are a series of sanctions soon to be introduced into parliament targeting the \u2018so-called \u201csub-espionage\u201d level of foreign interference such as individuals covertly lobbying, infiltrating or donating to political parties on behalf of foreign governments\u2019. \nWhile the logic of this trifecta of legislation seems sound, implementation may not be straightforward. At least one state has noted that \u2018significant details in the design and implementation of the proposed reforms are still being developed\u2019 and that \u2018the best result will be achieved through ongoing and structured consultation with the states and territories\u2019. This view suggests that federal intent is moving faster than state readiness currently allows. \nBut are there instances where a \u2018last resort\u2019 federal intervention is warranted? A recent Queensland Audit Office assessment of the adequacy of cybersecurity controls in potable water and wastewater services suggests that there are. The Audit Office concluded that while infrastructure operators were able to self-assess their capability to respond to information security incidents, they weren\u2019t well prepared to effectively respond to, or recover from, intentional cyberattacks. \nThose findings raise concerns about a repeat of an incident more than a decade ago when an intentional cyber disruption of a waste treatment plant\u2019s control systems in the Maroochy Shire in southern Queensland resulted in a significant release of raw sewage into the community. \nHowever, coercive federal intervention with state-based water-related utilities might not be a simple step because most local government water assets are incorporated as regional statutory bodies with local councils as shareholders. Thus, governance across three levels of government may add complexity if federal intervention into local-government-controlled assets is questioned. \nThe federal government has begun a very busy legislative phase and the policy agenda aligned to the work of the Critical Infrastructure Centre is progressing quickly. The many moving parts in Australia\u2019s national security community create the potential for uncertainty in the application and interpretation of the suite of new and proposed legislation. \nIt\u2019s also unclear whether the Critical Infrastructure Centre, as a new entity, has the expertise and capacity to both inform foreign investment review decisions and protect infrastructure from intentional disruption. Those are two very different tasks. The Critical Infrastructure Centre can\u2019t be expected to cover all bases. Author \nPaul Barnes is head of the risk and resilience program at ASPI. Anthony Bergin is a senior analyst at ASPI and a senior research fellow at the ANU\u2019s National Security College. This is the first of two pieces on the work of the Critical Infrastructure Centre.

Most of them, created in ancient times, being improved and have reached our days. \nSince the 12th century such well-known personalities as Nizami Ganjavi, famous musicologist and composer Abdulgadir Maragi, and great Uzbek poet Alisher Navoi, as well as Muhammad Fizuli mentioned this ancient instrument in their works. \nKamancha reached the greatest popularity in the 16th-17th centuries. The instrument itself consists of a round body made of walnut wood, a wide neck and connecting them, passing inside the body, a metal rod. In ancient times, the instrument consisted of one string, then two more strings were added, the modern kamancha, however, consists of four strings. \nKamancha is an indispensable tool in ensembles of professional traditional music of the East - Azerbaijani mugham. It is also used as a solo instrument. Instrumental plays, folk songs, and mugams are performed on this instrument. \nThe artistic value of Azerbaijani music and its high importance both for the national culture and to the world community have been universally recognized at the international level: in 2003 UNESCO recognized the Azerbaijani mugham as Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. \nIt should be noted that music and craftsmanship of another Azerbaijani musical instrument, tar, was also included in the UNESCO list during the seventh session of the UNESCO Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, in 2012. \nAdditionally, UNESCO intangible cultural heritage list includes the Novruz holiday, art of Azerbaijani Ashiq, traditional art and symbolism of Kelaghayi, copper craftsmanship of Lahij, Azerbaijani carpet, and flatbread making and sharing culture: lavash, katyrma, jupka, yufka. \n-- \nFollow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nizami ganjavi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alisher navoi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anar karimov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kamancha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muhammad fizuli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "azerbaijani ashiq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdulgadir maragi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "unesco", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cultural heritage", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "unesco intergovernmental committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intangible cultural heritage of humanity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intangible cultural heritage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of foreign affairs and permanent mission of azerbaijan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of culture and tourism", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intangible heritage of humanity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intergovernmental committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "international convention center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "azerbaijan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelaghayi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lahij", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:49:08.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a9add94d1e3a2fdf0ce4e32867227ccd3fe5f200", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRISb1AZdTREhGihql.sj7pudjPBfIkoMKQsI0npE45Xdo5DeekHZP1Q9xG2Djebn_dFpSas0ggtQ--", "site_full": "boards.cruisecritic.com", "site": "cruisecritic.com", "site_section": "https://boards.cruisecritic.com/forumdisplay.php?f=11", "site_categories": ["travel", "cruises"], "section_title": "Cruise Discussion Topics - Cruise Critic Message Board Forums", "title": "Snorkelling in December 2017 post hurricane: St. Kitts or St. Thomas??", "title_full": "Snorkelling in December 2017 post hurricane: St. Kitts or St. Thomas?? - Cruise Critic Message Board Forums", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.021, "main_image": "https://images.r.cruisecritic.com/logos/CruiseCriticLogo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4904, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a9add94d1e3a2fdf0ce4e32867227ccd3fe5f200", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRISb1AZdTREhGihql.sj7pudjPBfIkoMKQsI0npE45Xdo5DeekHZP1Q9xG2Djebn_dFpSas0ggtQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mermamasailsagain", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Snorkelling in December 2017 post hurricane: St. Kitts or St. Thomas??", "text": "Snorkelling in December 2017 post hurricane: St. Kitts or St. Thomas??\n On a Princess cruise over Christmas week and wondering which port is better to book a snorkelling excursion, St. Kitt's or St. Thomas and where and with whom would you go if choosing a tour?

Amid all the talk of conditions, bowling attacks and Steve Smith\u2019s runsome proclivities, this is the one thing in favour of the tourists. \nEngland like to collapse too, of course. They just have to hope that they do it less frequently \u2013 or at least less comprehensively \u2013 than their hosts. \nIs there any reason to assume that this will be the case? Let\u2019s take a look at some selective facts/prejudices. It happens \nSpeaking earlier this year, Smith said that his team was collapsing something like four times in every five innings. \nOkay, we can\u2019t remember the exact frequency (unlike larger, more profitable websites, you have to do your own research for these articles). It was often though. Take our word for that. Steve Smith is rattled \nThis is obvious because he said that England\u2019s sledging only inspired him and made him more focused. When it was put to him that his wasn\u2019t exactly an impartial view on the matter, he replied: \u201cOh no \u2013 even from an unbiased point of view.\u201d \nIf someone says that being sledged really helped them, it seems safe to assume that it did the exact opposite. Particularly when they made an unbeaten hundred unsledged and 40 and six when sledged. Shaun Marsh needs to repay his duck tax \nMarsh was always going to make a hundred. That\u2019s the upside of the pact you make when you select him.

The album, titled Speak English Or Die, was recorded and mixed over three days and has since been hailed as a landmark album that was among the first to fuse hardcore punk with thrash metal. They toured in support of the album in 1985, opening for Mot\u00f6rhead and The Plasmatics, among others. Their music served as the theme of the '80s incarnation of MTV's Headbangers Ball. They planned a follow-up titled USA For S.O.D. which was ultimately scrapped and never recorded.\" I heard a lot of Metal & Hardcore in the 80s and then came this album in and I was immediately excited, the intensity and dynamic which play the four their twenty-one songs is just awesome.

I hope you are doing well! Today I have another, a little more casual look for you. When in Paris, I am often running through the city, walking a lot and sometimes I am even trying to be a \"real\" tourist, even though I've been to the city over 10th time. Because of this, I am always trying to put on a combination, which looks nice, yet is very comfortable. One of my current favourite pieces are my new Chlo\u00e9 Susanna boots , which I got on my last in a store called \" Biondini \". They have several locations in Paris - two locations on Champs-Elys\u00e9es, one boutique in Galeries Lafayette and many many more. In the stores you are able to find many luxurious brands, including Saint Laurent, Stuart Weitzman, Balmain, Valentino or Gionvito Rossi. If you are in Paris, definitely make a stop in one of their beautiful boutiques - and if are not planning a trip at the moment, you can always take a look online and get your favourite pair delivered directly to your home! I had these boots on my wishlist for a longer time - I think they look a little different than my new Givenchy ones - but I am in love with both! Since the boots are really casual, I decided to pair them with a pair of black skinny jeans and a big, oversized sweater with a nude leather jacket over it. I have added my Chlo\u00e9 Fay bag, which not only fits the colour-theme of the look, but also the brand of the boots. So, how do you like the outfit? \nKr\u00e1sn\u00e9 r\u00e1no v\u0161em! Douf\u00e1m, \u017ee se v\u0161ichni m\u00e1te dob\u0159e!

Tuto zimu jsem si po\u0159\u00eddila koza\u010dky bez podpatk\u016f, a to z dvou d\u016fvod\u016f: 1) v\u011bt\u0161inu \u010dasu te\u010f tr\u00e1v\u00edm v Praze a odm\u00edtla jsem se tr\u00e1pit na podpatc\u00edch a 2) pot\u0159ebovala jsem n\u011bco trochu pohodln\u011bj\u0161\u00edho na cestov\u00e1n\u00ed.

There\u2019s a chance that\u2014at some point\u2014the North Koreans might want to combine the two testing programs, by putting a live nuclear warhead on top of a ballistic missile. That means, assuming all goes as it should, the missile would fly downrange to its appointed target zone, and the warhead would detonate in the atmosphere. That sort of test\u2014an end-to-end test of the full weapon system\u2014would be a convincing demonstration that Pyongyang had crossed the critical bridges: that it had a long-range ballistic missile with the throw-weight to carry a nuclear warhead, a warhead able to be placed atop the missile, and a re-entry vehicle that could survive the stresses of re-entry. \nIt would also be dangerous. A lot can go wrong during a ballistic missile test. When things do go wrong, missile controllers usually order the missile to self-destruct . But most missile tests don\u2019t involve live nuclear warheads. Besides, in the early stages of a missile\u2019s development, testing is primarily about learning the limitations and vulnerabilities of the particular weapon system. Becoming familiar with a ballistic missile typically involves a number of launches\u2014and God knows North Korea does few enough of those as it is . Remember the Hwasong-12, Pyongyang\u2019s intermediate-range ballistic missile? It\u2019s been tested three times. The Hwasong-14 ICBM? That was tested twice, both times on lofted trajectories. The latest missile, the Hwasong-15, has been test-fired only once\u2014again, on a lofted trajectory. \nWell, you might think, surely they have older, better-tested missiles somewhere in their arsenal. Sure they do, but those are generally short- and medium-range missiles\u2014which aren\u2019t of much use if the point is to lob a warhead somewhere out into the distant reaches of the Pacific Ocean. Putting a live nuclear warhead on a missile that wouldn\u2019t clear Japan isn\u2019t an option. But putting one on an under-proven longer-range delivery vehicle doesn\u2019t sound like a smart move either. Still, Pyongyang might be tempted down that path in order to demonstrate the \u2018completion\u2019 of its programs. \nSuch tests have been done before by other nuclear-weapon states. True, they\u2019re incredibly rare, and no such test has been conducted since the 1960s. In 1962, the US conducted a nuclear test involving an operational submarine-launched ballistic missile. The test, code-named \u2018Frigate Bird\u2019 , was held on 6 May. It was \u2018the only US test of an operational ballistic missile with a live warhead\u2019. It involved the launch of a Polaris A1 SLBM from the submarine USS Ethan Allen , a missile flight of about 1,000 nautical miles, and the atmospheric detonation of a 600-kiloton nuclear warhead in the vicinity of Christmas Island. (Let me hasten to assure Australian readers that the \u2018Christmas Island\u2019 in question was in the Line Islands in Kiribati, and not off the northwest coast of Australia.) \nAlthough the details are sketchy, the Russians seem to have done something similar in Test 95 , conducted on 13 September 1961. An SLBM launched from the Barents Sea flew to the test range on Novaya Zemlya. As a safety measure, the Russians seem to have deliberately replaced the missile\u2019s usual warhead with one of reduced yield, since the resulting nuclear detonation was about 6 kilotons. Some sources suggest there might have been other such tests as well, though it\u2019s important to count only those that actually involved ballistic missiles, rather than other weapon systems. \nIn October 1966, the Chinese conducted a nuclear test involving the ballistic-missile delivery of the warhead to their Lop Nur test site. This test was CHIC-4 , held on 27 October. The missile was a CSS-1 medium-range missile, which flew about 900 kilometres before the warhead\u2014a simple fission design with a yield of approximately 12 kilotons\u2014was detonated in the atmosphere. CHIC-3 had a yield of 250 kilotons, and CHIC-5 300 kilotons, so it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the Chinese also made an effort to dial back the CHIC-4 yield as a safety precaution. (As a point of interest, the CHIC-4 design\u2014labelled \u2018early, [and] inefficient\u2019 by the CIA\u2014is the one the Chinese later shared with the Pakistanis.) \nGiven that the US and Russia have both conducted end-to-end tests by using SLBMs, Kim Jong-un might be drawn to pursue a similar option. An SLBM needn\u2019t involve overflight of Japan. And it would allow the test to be conducted remote from major urban areas. But that assumes, of course, that Kim has a working SLBM, not to mention a submarine capable of launching it\u2014which he probably doesn\u2019t at this point in time. What Kim has is an under-tested ICBM capability, plus of course an under-tested intermediate-range ballistic missile capability. If he decides to try for an end-to-end nuclear test with one of those, we might be in trouble. \nNone of the previous tests by the US, Russia and China, remember, have involved an intercontinental-range or even an intermediate-range missile. Any scenario in which Pyongyang attempts such a test\u2014humorously labelled \u2018Juche Bird\u2019 by some\u2014is fraught with danger. Indeed, even the preparations for such a test, including the loading of a nuclear warhead onto a long-range missile, might well trigger a US pre-emptive strike. After all, how could a US president be confident that a nuclear-tipped ICBM was being launched only for testing purposes? Author \nRod Lyon is a senior fellow at ASPI. Edited image   Brian Westcott .

Lowe Street in Stuttgart. Arkansas County Prosecuting Attorney Robert Ditrich said Morgan McDonald, 30, of Stuttgart, was arraigned on a first-degree murder charge along with a felony in the possession of a firearm charge. No bond has been set, according to Dittrich due to the probation revocation. A pre-trial date has been set for Jan. 29 with a jury trial set for Feb. 27, as of press time. SPD officers responded to the above address where they found Charles Lindel Ice, 39, of Stuttgart, suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. Ice was transported to Baptist Health Medical Center-Stuttgart where he was pronounced dead. The body was transported to the Arkansas State Crime Lab to determine manner and cause of death. According to initial witness statements, Ice was involved in a physical altercation with McDonald before the shooting occurred. McDonald was located late Sunday evening and taken into custody by the ASP and SPD. McDonald is being held at the Arkansas County Detention Center in DeWitt.
