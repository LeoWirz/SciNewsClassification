The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and buffeted the house. But it did not collapse; it had been set solidly on rock. \nAnd everyone who listens to these words of mine but does not act on them will be like a fool who built his house on sand. The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and buffeted the house.

He may be referring to the day of judgment, since this seems to be the focus of Matt 7:21\u201323. \n  \nThe Sermon on the Mount ends with a call to action. It is not enough to recognize Jesus as a new Moses or to acknowledge his teaching as a new Torah. The challenge is to respond to the words of the Messiah by walking the high and difficult road that he marks out for us. In essence, it is a summons to live as Jesus lived. \nPope Benedict XVI put it this way: \u201cThe Sermon on the Mount is addressed to the entire world, the entire present and future, and yet it demands discipleship and can be understood and lived out only by following Jesus and accompanying him on his journey.\u201d \nShould discouragement weigh us down along the way, let us remember that what Jesus demands of us he enables us to do. Apart from the grace that he offers, this new way of living is unattainable\u2014an ethical ideal that could never become real in the lives of disciples. Part of the challenge, then, is to avail ourselves of all the blessings that Jesus makes available to us through prayer and a full participation in the sacramental life of the Church. \n\u2013 Curtis Mitch and Edward Sri \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew 7:21", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pope benedict xvi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edward sri  may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2013 curtis mitch", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "church", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mount", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palestine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:03.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8fdffb56e282adb7819cc6512aa5bc3a51566824", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSv1D9ZbkQFmMQgnw2m4NktUNlqnXW.16ceGYAewrWQOsN7p3ipU3CXhg2RPu_y79oRtsOcoptOw1f.KX77GRclpP0iNHZrZNXyLPvA1SDBxXj.VQpc7p93gTe573kzSn9", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "popular links", "title": "After watching Shrek, Eleanor couldn't help but think she was committing an atrocity.

She than mentions that the elevator is out of service which is very annoying when you have been stuck in a car for 4 hours and now have to take the stairs with two heavy suitcases. My room was ok. I asked for a king bed and defintely recieved one. Although sink for bathroom is outside the bathroom which i found odd. The room was clean and discent for a weekend trip but defintely not for a week+ long trip. Breakfast selection was fair but too many people so i didnt try it to know if it was good or not. There isnt much around the hotel except for a dunkin donuts, denny\u2019s, pizza place and italian resturant. Although when we were there the pizza place was closed on a Saturday at 7:00pm wasnt very impressed by that. The hotel is overall ok i have defintely stayed in worse but you also get what you pay for.

Willis Plaza East Bengal FC Shillong Lajong FC I-League 2017 (I-League) Goal \nUpdated at 5:52 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:52 a.m. ET \nA handful of East Bengal fans who attended their club's training session at the Barasat Stadium in Kolkata did not hide their feelings towards coach Khalid Jamil and striker Willis Plaza as both of them were greeted with \"Go Back\" chants. Although the Red and Gold's officials are showing patience with their I League winning coach, they are not willing to put up with Jamils's blue eyed boy Plaza. \nThe officials have contacted other alternative options, with former East Bengal player Ranti Martins topping their wishlist. According to reports, the Nigerian has clearly stated that he can join only after February as he must continue his stay in the United States to fulfill his 'Green Card' formalities. East Bengal though, cannot afford to wait until February. So, Darryl Duffy and Edeh Chidi are being considered as the alternatives, as reported in Sangbad Pratidin. \nDuffy is currently plying his trade with St. Mirren FC in the Scottish second tier. He is likely to join East Bengal as he has been a bench warmer in nine games out of 11 for his current side and came on as a substitute in the remaining two matches only in the dying minutes. \nJamil is all set to completely overhaul his starting XI against Shillong Lajong. Arnab Mondal will pair with Eduardo Ferreira at the heart of defense and Chullova will replace Mehtab Singh at right back. Left back Deepak Kumar will also make way for Salam Ranjan Singh who played as a centre-back against Aizwal FC. Katsumi Yusa is expected to operate from his favourite right wing position with Plaza and Charles D'Souza leading the attack. \nOn the other hand, Mohun Bagan's Australian recruit Diogo Ferreira has still not been able to impress coach Sanjoy Sen and he is likely to remain out of squad for their next game against Churchill Brothers. Star striker and the top goal scorer of previous season Dipanda Dicka has shrugged off his knee injury and might feature against Churchill. Sen is reluctant to break the winning combination and if all goes well, Mohun Bagan will field the same starting XI that took the pitch against East Bengal.

The film is being helmed by Raj Kumar Gupta and the films set in the 1980s Uttar Pradesh. Raid will be produced by Bhushan Kumar and Kumar Mangat, written by Ritesh Shah and it is slated to release on April 20, 2018. Ajay Devgn Will Share Screen Space With Real Police Officers In Raid Interestingly, the Baadshaho actor will be sharing a screen space real police officer in the film. The police officer named Ram Raksha Singh, who is an Assistant Sub Inspector of the UP police, is quite excited to be the part of his favourite idol\u2019s film. He considers it to be the dream come true moment since he is getting to work with Ajay. According to a report in The Times Of India, Ajay especially went and met Singh and also introduced him to the other cast and crew members. He also told the team that Singh was a real and not a nakli cop. An excited Singh said, \u201cMy life has changed completely ever since that article was published about me working with Ajay Devgn in Raid . He read the article and would look at me while we were on the set. And then a couple of days later, he walked up to me, smiled and shook my hand. He told me that he had read the article and then introduced me to Saurabh Shukla and said, \u2018You know? He\u2019s a real cop!\u2019 It was probably the most precious moment of my life.\u201d Trending Ram Raksha Singh has wrapped up his part in Lucknow on Sunday. He said, \u201cI shot with Ajay for about a month and there was not a single person he didn\u2019t tell about me. He also told Ileana D\u2019Cruz about me and how I was a policeman in real life, too. He even praised my style. Unhone director sahab, Raj Kumar Gupta ko meri uniform dikhayi aur bole, \u2018Inki uniform dekhiye. Kitni perfect hai kyunki yehreal-life police officer hain.\u2019 The article familiarised me with Ajay Devgn and now, he knows who I am apart from being just another actor on sets and that I feel is a big thing for me.\u201d Singh will be seen playing a role of a policeman who accompanies Ajay in the raid which he conducts. Sharing his experience of working with Ajay, Singh said, \u201cItne din Ajay ke saath kaam karke maine realise kiya ki woh police walon ki bahut izzat karte hain. He really holds our profession in high regard and needless to say, I am extremely proud of being a policeman.\u201d Another Sub Inspector Abdul Salaam Siddiqui of the UP police has also shot a few scenes with Ajay. He said, \u201cI met Ajay a couple of times after the article appeared and he recognised me immediately.

Despite its widely utilization, there seems to be a great variability in their organization, clinical practice, and safety among centers.Aim of the studyTo obtain updated information on clinical practice in different perioperative areas of the CRS-HIPEC.Patients and MethodsAll 25 members of the Spanish Surface Peritoneal Malignancy (GECOP), were invited to answer an online survey, to describe their usual practice in different perioperative areas of the CRS-HIPEC.ResultsSurvey was responded by 100% of centers. This study represents more than 800 patients treated annually. Seventy per cent of respondents perform CRS-HIPEC for more than 5 years. The most frequent technique was Coliseum (88%). Routinely non-invasive monitoring of cardiac output is used by 92% of centers. More than 50% of centers administer oxaliplatin (74%), or mitomycin-C (65%) in colorectal cancer; cisplatin in gastric cancer (73%) and mesothelioma (74%). Ovarian cancer is treated with cisplatin and various combinations, in 64%. Spillage protocol was available in 100% centers.ConclusionsData showed an important variability in volume of patients per center, selection of cytostatic agents, professional training and safety measures applied. The standardization of CRS/HIPEC procedures based on the best available evidence, the individualization of patients and the consensus among professionals, constitute an important part of the basis that will allow us to improve results of this complex procedure.\n\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2zXYANl\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "neus esteve-p\u00e9rez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedro cascales-campos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafael morales-soriano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juan jos\u00e9 segura-sampedro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedro barrios", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "european journal of surgical oncology aut", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:06.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "daaaa0afc6e710ca1ff2634486ced26e063aeb96", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm2eksKXqNLl3xyIsObgrf6K", "site_full": "www.ooyuz.com", "site": "ooyuz.com", "site_section": "http://www.ooyuz.com/newsanalysis?term=abrams", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "abrams News Results and Analysis |OOYUZ", "title": "'Star Trek' Movie In The Works From Quentin Tarantino, JJ Abrams", "title_full": "'Star Trek' Movie In The Works From Quentin Tarantino, JJ Abrams : Related Articles | OOYUZ", "published": "2017-12-05T00:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53324, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "daaaa0afc6e710ca1ff2634486ced26e063aeb96", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8KSMTvPVjIlisnYmQDt50k3dtGZxnThm2eksKXqNLl3xyIsObgrf6K", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Comic Book", "published": "2017-12-05T00:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "'Star Trek' Movie In The Works From Quentin Tarantino, JJ Abrams", "text": "Prolific director Quentin Tarantino made headlines months ago when he said he would be open to directing a new Star Trek film.

The makers released its trailer yesterday and it has received well from the fans. The film which had a tough time with the Censor Board, is now finally releasing. Putting all the rumours to rest that the film will only release on Netflix, the makers have finally announced the release date and it is now coming on January 12, 2018. Saif Ali Khan: If Padmavati Releases, We Will Shift Kaalakaandi But yesterday, at the trailer launch event of Kaalakaandi , Saif asserted that there may be some changes in the release date if Sanjay Leela Bhansali\u2019s Padmavati hits the theatres on January 12. Though, there is no clarity from the makers of Padmavati about its next release date. The Salaam Namaste actor said, \u201cIf Padmavati comes in [on that day], we will think of shifting our release date. I hope we don\u2019t have to do that. Kaalakaandi is a film I am proud of.\u201d We all know that most of the filmmakers and production house avoid clashing at the box office but the Nawab Khan believes that the different genres of films releasing on the same day show the diversity that Cinema can offer. \u201cIt would have been nice to see Kaalakaandi releasing with Padmavati, as it shows that we have a film industry, which makes different kinds of movies. Recently, we saw Secret Superstar and Golmaal Again releasing on the same day and both films did well. Personally, I feel it\u2019s a good time to have films releasing alongside one another. But filmmakers are wary about it and you need to take that into consideration,\u201d he said. Trending At the event, Saif also spoke about the box office numbers and he confessed that he does feel bad and it does bother to him if his films don\u2019t do well. Off late, his film Chef didn\u2019t do a fare business even after the content of the film was great. Speaking about it, Saif said, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to think that people no longer want to see me in a film. But I don\u2019t do that. I get my confidence back every time, irrespective of whether my film works or not. I\u2019ll keep working and hopefully, things will fall into place.\u201d This dark comedy is the story of six characters from different worlds \u2014 urban, ambitious Mumbai and its dark, neglected underbelly. Kaalakaandi is a Marathi slang for when things go disastrously wrong. The film is a dark comedy about life, death and karma. Directed by Akshat Verma, who has written the cult Delhi Belly, also stars Deepak Dobriyal, Vijay Raz, Kunal Roy Kapoor, Sobhita Dhulipala, Akshay Oberoi, Isha Talwar, Shenaz Treasury, Shivam Patil, Amyra Dastur and Neil Bhoopalam.

This investigation is far from over.- Joaquin Castro (@JoaquinCastrotx) December 6, 2017\nHe was questioned for over eight hours.\nHe claimed that conversations with his father were protected by attorney-client privilege.\nI'm sure a lot of that 8 hours was a sock puppet show explaining how attorney-client privilege works.\nMy God, this is such a great set-up. If they were meeting to figure out how to cover up an illegal act it's not covered. And then if conversation was not covered under attorney client privilege he's admitted there are witnesses that can also be interviewed. They are so dumb, Trump Jr should have taken the 5th.\nPresence of a third party negates attorney-client privilege.\nPretty sure attorney-client privilege also doesn't cover discussing crimes you are planning to commit.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:06.013+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15098677, "moreResultsAvailable": 15098577, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512640746013&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 335}
