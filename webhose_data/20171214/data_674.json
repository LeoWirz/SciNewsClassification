EST December 06, 2017 BLANDING, UT - MAY 11; The two bluffs known as the \"Bears Ears\" stand off in the distance in the Bears Ears National Monument on May 11, 2017 outside Blanding, Utah. (Photo by George Frey/Getty Images) (Photo: George Frey, 2017 Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET PINTEREST \nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Outdoor retailing giant Patagonia on Wednesday joined a flurry of lawsuits challenging President Donald Trump's decision to chop up two large national monuments in Utah could finally bring an answer to the much-debated question of whether presidents have the legal authority to undo or change monuments created by past presidents. Until that question is answered months or years from now, the fate of the contested lands in Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments will remain unresolved. Proclamations signed Monday by the president allow lands no longer protected as a national monument to be opened up in 60 days to mining, but conservation and tribal groups will likely try to keep that from happening. Mark Squillace, professor of natural resources law at the University of Colorado-Boulder, said he doubts the federal government would permit mining so quickly after Trump's announcement because it would be bad politics, especially as the legal battle mushrooms. California-based Patagonia filed its lawsuit on behalf of several other organizations to block Trump's reductions to Bears Ears. The California-based company said in the lawsuit that Trump's proclamation shrinking the monument by 85 percent exceeds the president's authority and strips much-needed protections from sacred tribal lands. Patagonia also replaced its usual home page with a stark message, \"The President Stole Your Land.\" The post drew a strong rebuke from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke who called it \"nefarious, false and a lie.\" Three lawsuits already had been filed involving Utah's monuments. And more are expected \u2014 especially if Trump follows Zinke's recommendations to shrink two other monuments \u2014 Gold Butte in Nevada and Cascade Siskiyou in Oregon. Supporters of Trump's move welcomed the fight, saying it will answer longstanding questions about presidential power involving the protection of land.\"Hopefully, we can have some closure on what the president can and cannot do,\" said Mike Noel, a Republican state representative in Utah who was on stage with the president during his proclamation signing in Salt Lake City. Past presidents have trimmed national monuments and redrawn their boundaries 18 times, according to the National Park Service. Legal experts disagree on whether the 1906 Antiquities Act \u2014 allowing presidents to create a monument \u2014 also lets them reduce one. The question has never been settled in court, but conservation and paleontology groups and Native American tribes launching lawsuits are preparing to argue that Trump doesn't have that authority and his move jeopardizes a wealth of Native American artifacts, dinosaur fossils and rugged spaces.\"Gee whiz, it sounds like there are going to be a lot of attorneys making a whole lot of money,\" quipped Noel. \"For every organization, there's a lunch ticket for a group of attorneys to exist.\" Noel plans to intervene himself, filing a court brief to show support for the president's actions. Donald Kochan, a professor of natural resources, property and administrative law at Chapman University in Orange, California, believes Trump's action is likely legal and the separate lawsuits allow each group to show supporters they're speaking up. Squillace said the lawsuits will likely be merged into one case for each monument. He thinks a court will try to focus on the overall question of whether Trump has the authority to reduce the monuments \u2014 something Squillace doesn't think the president has the legal authority to do. While the legal battles play out, Utah Republican Rep. Rob Bishop, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, has introduced a bill that would prevent presidents from designating monuments larger than 85,000 acres and give states and local officials the power to veto a monument larger than 10,000 acres.

(AP) \u2014 Former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship, who went to prison after a mine explosion, plans to run for the U.S. Senate seat in West Virginia held by Democratic U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, a spokesman said Wednesday.\nThe formal filing was expected Wednesday, spokesman Greg Thomas told The Associated Press. The Senate clerk's office said it hadn't received it shortly before closing at 6 p.m.\nThe 67-year-old Blankenship was released from a federal prison in California in May after serving a one-year term related to the deadliest U.S. mine explosion in four decades. He is serving one year of supervised release.\nLATEST SFGATE VIDEOS Now Playing: Now Playing Behind the scenes: \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" sfgate Star Wars: The Last Jedi (official trailer) sfgate Muni bus and streetcar collide sfgate Time lapse of Bay Area traffic sfgate Mountain lion and kitten spotted for first time since fire sfgate Santa Rosa firefighters headed south to fight LA blaze sfgate The best views in Russian Hill sfgate Ventura resident shows view of massive fire sfgate Oakland city workers go on strike sfgate Smoke from Creek Fire smothers Lake View Terrace in Los Angeles sfgate Blankenship was sentenced last year for a misdemeanor conviction of conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards at Massey's Upper Big Branch Mine in southern West Virginia, where 29 workers died in a 2010 explosion.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court recently rejected Blankenship's bid to appeal. He has insisted he's innocent, and that natural gas and not methane gas and excess coal dust caused the explosion. He has blamed Manchin for helping create the public sentiment against him. On Twitter, when he was released, Blankenship challenged Manchin to debate him.\n\"A U.S. Senator who says I have 'blood on my hands' should be man enough to face me in public,\" Blankenship wrote.\nAt the time, Manchin responded with a statement saying he hopes Blankenship \"chooses to do the right thing and disappear from the public eye.\"\nWest Virginia GOP Chairman Conrad Lucas said he's heard Blankenship is running. Lucas said Blankenship is a Republican.\nThe Republican field for next year's election already includes West Virginia state Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. They have begun attacking each other, with Jenkins faulting Morrisey as an ex-lobbyist for drug companies and Morrisey criticizing Jenkins as an ex-Democrat.\nFederal Election Commission records also show West Virginia native and activist Paula Jean Swearingen as a Democratic candidate for the Senate seat.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/67/62/20/14623769/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/qyZLykzv-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/ymIabdMc-720.jpg)", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/oT0P81gO-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/fPX3XJZJ-720.jpg)", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/67/62/20/14623769/5/920x920.jpg", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/r6YuJPz1-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/Y1yGNtl0-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/Kc2ifh3L-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/GTtCvdHL-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/5T4LjYVX-720.jpg)", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/Gf0WUwLB-720.jpg)"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:15.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1179898309642fb58e9ff7fe0d4efeb369042f93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog61cwdCLcyylkEqas6.EI0bgyqBeWpcAxp5FAgRpbO7M1FOOflbcxyRYluXlybppRbnVoG6q5aJZaMR03uV6MIp1WM23tHP.dJ.KDuaieZvphdEqhoOZKDAA-", "site_full": "community.boredofstudies.org", "site": "boredofstudies.org", "site_section": "http://community.boredofstudies.org/459/secondary-education/", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "adult", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Secondary Education", "title": "How to ace oral presentations - Page 4", "title_full": "How to ace oral presentations - Page 4", "published": "2017-12-06T22:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.04, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1179898309642fb58e9ff7fe0d4efeb369042f93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5je.krt0vaog61cwdCLcyylkEqas6.EI0bgyqBeWpcAxp5FAgRpbO7M1FOOflbcxyRYluXlybppRbnVoG6q5aJZaMR03uV6MIp1WM23tHP.dJ.KDuaieZvphdEqhoOZKDAA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "KyCoo", "published": "2017-12-06T22:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "How to ace oral presentations - Page 4", "text": "Very good read.

Luxury marketers were once known for innovation and craftsmanship before adopting practices from mainstream brands to scale and meet corporate and financial market goals. Shortage of skilled craftsmen has put pressure on heritage luxury brands, in addition to retail floor staff churn. Now, the unrelenting push to automate manufacturing and service processes, as well as technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality and artificial intelligence, threatens to change the very fabric of what it means to be luxury. Adapt or resist? \nSpeakers: \nPaul Boomsma , president, Luxury Portfolio International \nWolfgang Schaefer , chief strategy officer, Select Worldwide \nModerator: \nLisa Koenigsberg , founder/president, Initiatives in Art and Culture \n11 a.m. \nExperience in a Material-Driven Luxury World Buzzword of the year: Experience. But what does it really mean in the luxury context? And how is it different from the current in-store experience, which is in a class of its own?

While brand values have always played a role in luxury purchasing, a well-articulated positioning has never been more critical to the success of luxury brands. This shift to meaningful consumption is driven partly by the sea of sameness in products and services, but, more importantly, by the acknowledgment that \u201cwe have it pretty good\u201d and choices should reflect a desire to do what is right and what is good. Affluent consumers want to find the best of who they are in the choices they make. \nSpeaker: \nCara David , managing partner, YouGov \n2 p.m. \nCurated Media in a Content-Saturated and Social-Fueled World Luxury brands live by their reputation. So do curated media brands. Yet the rise of celebrity influencers is unstoppable, with these individuals boasting larger followings on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Are magazines, newspapers and their digital editions still the best way for luxury brands to connect with their audiences?

not-for-profit agricultural purchasing organisation is using Filestream's electronic document management software (EDMS) to manage all the storage and indexing of invoices which total around 480,000 per year. \nLONDON (PRWEB UK) 7 December 2017 \nFilestream announces that the largest not-for-profit agricultural purchasing organisation in the UK, AF Group, is using its electronic document management software (EDMS) to manage all the storage and indexing of invoices which total around 480,000 per year. \nWith a turnover in excess of \u00a3230 million annually, The AF Group (AF) purchases around 10% of the UK\u2019s total farm inputs on behalf of its 3,500 stakeholder members. Working with 1,900 suppliers, it procures 200,000 tonnes of fertiliser, 80 million litres of fuel, 105,000 tonnes of livestock feed, 500 cars and over \u00a32 million worth of tyres. In addition, AF manages 14,000 mobile phone and 5,o00 fixed lines contracts. \nWith its headquarters in Norfolk, AF formed in January 2003 as a result of the merger of two long established buying groups - Loddon Farmers and Mid Norfolk Farmers. \nAlex Morton, AF\u2019s operations manager, says, \u201cWe get greater buying power for our members through economies of scale, with an efficient back office service reducing their administrative overheads. It means farmers can get on and farm rather than dealing with all the invoicing and accounting tasks related to the purchasing of equipment and supplies for their businesses.\u201d \nEDMS solves the paper handling process each month \nWith so many transactions and a membership growing year on year, managing the invoice process was a paper handling headache given that most came by post. Each month, AF used to collate all the invoices from suppliers, photocopy and then post the members the originals as a printed consolidated pack with a statement outlining the amount due. Self-evidently, this was hugely laborious, time-consuming, inefficient and error prone. \nTo solve this, AF has worked closely with suppliers so that many now submit invoices electronically \u2013 via either email or XML \u2013 with an EDMS from Filestream purchased to store and index them. Today, 40% of invoices are processed via XML up from 20% in 2015. Error rates with billing are just 0.4% - an impressive figure given the quantity of invoices received. Paper invoices received are scanned and stored in File Stream, too. \nFile Stream integrates with AF\u2019s bespoke built CRM called AFi which allows all staff in the office to view any invoice related to a supplier or member at the touch of a button. The use of XML also means that staff avoid having to rekey information into its systems thereby improving data capture. \nAlex Morton says, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to extract more data from our invoices so we can complete further analysis about what we\u2019re buying. Historically, if an invoice was received with 20 or so line items, for example, this would be entered as 1 line and coded to \u2018machinery\u2019, which is not very useful. Now we use a tool called Esker to extract all the detail from a PDF invoice and then business intelligence and data analytics software from Tableau to interrogate this \nfurther. This means ultimately we\u2019ll be in a better position to assess at a granular level precisely what we\u2019re buying and then negotiate better prices with suppliers on behalf of our members.\u201d \nThe use of an EDMS to store copies of all invoices helps AF\u2019s back office staff to automate the generation of members\u2019 eBilling packs each month. \nAlex Morton says, \u201cOur eBilling process has become quite advanced, allowing us to consolidate 40,000 invoices each month and send packs to each member, 75% of which are e-mailed. Members can also view invoices via a portal called AF Interactive, and then download accounts data straight into their own software packages like Farm Plan.\u201d \nWhile 95% of the content stored in File Stream is invoice related, AF is also using the software to manage other corporate information such as membership renewal forms, contracts and order confirmations. \nEDMS delivers clear return on investment \nFile Stream is delivering five key benefits to AF: \n1. Productivity is enhanced through the removal of paper-based processes. Compared to the volumes in 2003, AF processes about ten times as many invoices each month but with the same number of administrative staff; 2. Service to members is improved as billing information is provided accurately to them and on time. 3. Levy costs to members per transaction have been maintained due to the increased efficiency of AF\u2019s back office operation. 4. Access to accounting and corporate information is quick and easy and available at a touch of a button. 5. Data retention policies can easily be set in the software so that auditing and compliance rules are met. \nCharles Hooker, Filestream\u2019s managing director, says, \u201cOur software is easy to use, flexible and has created a central repository for AF to store invoices and other corporate data. It is an excellent use case example of where EDMS really delivers commercial value given a manual paper-based way of managing invoices has been removed.\u201d \nAbout Filestream Limited \nBased in Wokingham, Filestream Limited is a supplier of electronic document management software. First developed in 2003, Filestream\u2019s EDMS is written in-house by developers using current Microsoft\u00ae technology including MS SQL and .net framework.

It seems to me you are confused about how IP subnetting works. If so, I could recommend a book or two, if online tutorials aren't helpful.\nVery very briefly, a /24 subnet such as 192.168.1.0/24 contains 256 addresses. 254 of the addresses may be assigned to devices (.1 - .254), while 2 of the addresses are reserved (.0 and .255). If you want to have two /24 subnets in sequence, the next such subnet would be 192.168.2.0, with its 256 addresses, and so on.\nWhile I find CIDR notation much more clear to me than decimal netmask notation, it won't matter to you if you do not understand what these notations mean, and how subnets are addressed.\nOpenBSD's hostname.if(5) and ifconfig(8) provisioning tools will accept either notation format for IPv4 addressing.\nSecond . There are MANY private address ranges. The most common ranges for private IPv4 networks are the RFC 1918 address ranges. There are three ranges in that RFC, which you can subdivide into as many subnets as you wish.\n10.0.0.0/8. This is the range 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255, which is 16,777,216 addresses.\n172.16.0.0/12. This is the range 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255, which is 1,048,576 addresses.\n192.168.0.0/16. This is the range 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255, which is 65,536 addresses.\n----\nRecommendation: Pick one of these RFC 1918 ranges, and subdivide it into as many /24 subnets as you need.

EST December 07, 2017 May 24, 2017; Berea, OH, USA; Cleveland Browns owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam leave the field during organized team activities at the Cleveland Browns training facility. (Photo: USA TODAY Sports, Ken Blaze) \nCLEVELAND - I'm going to mention the Cleveland Browns losing record just once in this column. \nThey are 0-12 this season and 1-27 over the past two years. There, I said it. \nFrankly, I'm much more concerned about the turmoil off the field, than I am about what I see every Sunday. \nWe can all read the tea leaves to see that changes are coming to 76 Lou Groza Blvd. Something has to give, right? A new front office. A new head coach. \nHere's my problem: I'm not sure I have confidence that owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam can make the right call. \nWhy, you ask? \nLet's review the management-coach structure in the almost five full seasons that the Haslams have owned the team. 2013--Joe Banner, Michael Lombardi, Rob Chudzinski \nRecord: 4-12, including 7 losses in a row to end the year \nDespite only one year as head coach, the Browns canned Chud after the season. The NFL Network's Ian Rappoport said at the time: \"The team's brain trust -- Haslam, Banner and general manager Mike Lombardi -- felt that the Browns were not improving or responding to Chudzinski and his assistants. When the front office recently shared its concerns with Chudzinski, he did not seem to believe that the team's problems were severe.\" \nA Browns veteran player told NFL.com's Mike Silver post-Chud : \"We are so dysfunctional. These billionaires need to pick somebody and stay with them. These aren't girlfriends. You can't dump them if they (fail to please you) one time. Too many dominoes fall and (screw stuff) up when that happens. This is highly upsetting.\" \nSo the Browns had to pick a new head coach as we went into early 2014. \nJim Donovan told us an amazing story in a recent Donovan Live Postgame Show. Bill Belichick asked old buddy Mike Lombardi for a favor: give former Buccaneers head coach Greg Schiano an interview for the head coaching job in Cleveland. Lombardi did an end-around past Banner to Jimmy Haslam and the trio interviewed Schiano during the week of the Senior Bowl. \nOne problem: Banner sat silent during the interview and didn't ask a single question. \nJimmy Haslam ultimately hired Mike Pettine after several candidates said no, jettisoned both Banner and Lombardi, and promoted Assistant GM Ray Farmer. 2014-15--Ray Farmer and Mike Pettine \nRecord: 7-9 in 2014, 3-13 in 2015 \nFor one of the few times in the expansion era, there was excitement about the Browns that carried through most of the season. After Billy Cundiff's game winning field goal in Atlanta, the Browns were 7-4 and in a virtual four-way tie atop the AFC North. (The Bengals were 7-3-1). Then came disaster. \n5 straight losses. Brian Hoyer benched at quarterback for Johnny Manziel. Textgate. Kyle Shanahan's departure as offensive coordinator, mainly because of Farmer's texts critiquing the play-calling. \nFarmer was suspended by the league. The tension between he and the coaching staff only escalated the following season. Manziel's off-the-field shenanigans got worse. Farmer's four first-round draft picks from the two years netted minimal results. Thanks for playing guys, you're dismissed. 2016-17--Sashi Brown, Paul DePodesta, Hue Jackson \nRecord: Nope, not gonna do it again. If you need a refresher on how bad things have been, click here. \nI happened to be anchoring ESPN Cleveland's Browns coverage the night the 2015 season ended. There was a press conference set for that Sunday evening at First Energy Stadium. When reports that Sashi Brown, the team's general counsel, would be promoted to VP of football operations and be in charge of the 53-man roster, I almost fell off my chair. \nHaslam said that the team would hire a new coach first. The coach then would be involved in choosing the general manager, whose duties would focus scouting and talent acquisition. The general manager will report to Brown, the coach to Haslam. \nThe idea would be that all would work together and collaborate on decisions. Brown would get final authority on roster and draft, while the coach will decide how players are used on Sundays. \nSashi Brown, a man who had never spent a day handling talent evaluation, or scouting, or coaching, would now be making the team's final roster decisions. And he would be aided by none other than Paul DePodesta, a baseball analytics executive, in the front office. \nSorry, it wasn't a good idea then. It's still not now. \nThere have been a bevy of mistakes made by the Brown-DePodesta front office, from letting key free agents walk out the door, to not pulling the trigger on potential franchise quarterbacks in back-to-back drafts, to failing to execute a trade properly before the deadline. Years spent stockpiling draft picks seem to have been wasted. \nWorse, it's obvious that the front office and coaching staff are not in lockstep. Almost every Sunday, I feel like CBS' Jason LaCanfora has a scoop about unrest between coaches and scouts, from the trading of DeMario Davis for Calvin Pryor, to the release of Joe Haden. The disconnect has built yet more animosity in the halls of Berea. It can't go on like this. \nThe other problem is that on an almost daily basis, we are inundated with bombshells coming from the Pilot Flying J trial in Tennessee. Let's be clear: Jimmy Haslam is not charged and has continued to deny any knowledge of or involvement in the fuel rebate scheme. \nBut when you consider that 13 former Pilot executives have pleaded guilty in the scandal, and four others are on trial, doesn't it make you a little scared about the kind of people the Haslams are placing their trust in? \nMaybe that's unfair, but when you add that to the revolving door of Berea, it does give me pause. \nSo what's the answer? \nMy colleague Matt Florjancic joking mentioned that the Haslams need to attend a \"Team-Building\" camp. Heck, I'd settle for a seminar. \nThere's got to be a change in culture in the Browns organization. Enough with the wide gap between coaches, front office, and business personnel. No more backbiting. The goal needs to be about winning games and re-establishing the Browns as one of the flagship franchises in pro football. It used to be that way. I'm old enough to remember when. \nHealthy disagreement is fine. In fact, I'm in favor of it. But this franchise needs to be on the same page upstairs, before we can even take a good look at who should be in the locker room downstairs. \nEarlier this week, Jim Donovan suggested the Browns need a savior, a miracle worker. \nMaybe it will ultimately be Peyton Manning. I'd prefer someone with more front-office experience, or maybe Manning coming with a mentor to help him navigate the choppy waters of building a football operation. \nI suggested in a previous post that the Haslams should bring in a consultant, such as former Browns GM Ernie Accorsi, to help advise them. (Accorsi, by the by, has just been retained by another former team, the Giants, to help them in their search) \nRight now, I'd just like a little hope. \n\u00a9 2017 WKYC-TV ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dave", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill belichick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyle shanahan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy haslam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billy cundiff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian rappoport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim donovan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dee haslam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnny manziel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ernie accorsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael lombardi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accorsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "demario davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lou groza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peyton manning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike pettine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg schiano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason lacanfora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike lombardi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manziel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "natale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe banner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian hoyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul depodesta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assistant gm ray farmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calvin pryor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe haden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chudzinski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lombardi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schiano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sashi brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ray farmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike silver post-chud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken blaze", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haslam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob chudzinski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt florjancic", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cleveland browns", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nfl network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "first energy stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "espn cleveland's browns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "browns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buccaneers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl.com", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brown-depodesta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:16.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d97bbcca2a5cece6ad131f120f6be5d3689773da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQY.gRDA6k9Whd54VYTLwvaGJAu0JAUf7BRmleDJw2VTeXZ.Z5oAjjX8NM2CQozZgNPDu3IC9TilxfzgAxkLmm.WzPyta3J5aGVtH2M4LvBQ--", "site_full": "www.itsecuritynews.info", "site": "itsecuritynews.info", "site_section": "https://www.itsecuritynews.info", "site_categories": ["hacking", "tech"], "section_title": "IT Security News", "title": "Global security spending to reach $96 billion in 2018", "title_full": "Global security spending to reach $96 billion in 2018", "published": "2017-12-07T12:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d97bbcca2a5cece6ad131f120f6be5d3689773da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQY.gRDA6k9Whd54VYTLwvaGJAu0JAUf7BRmleDJw2VTeXZ.Z5oAjjX8NM2CQozZgNPDu3IC9TilxfzgAxkLmm.WzPyta3J5aGVtH2M4LvBQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ITSecurityNews", "published": "2017-12-07T12:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Global security spending to reach $96 billion in 2018", "text": "Gartner forecasts worldwide enterprise security spending to total $96.3 billion in 2018, an increase of 8 percent from 2017.

Je travaille pour la CAF en tant que membre du comit\u00e9 de d\u00e9veloppement de la conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration africaine de football. Je suis aussi consultant pour beIN Sports \u00e0 Doha, Proximus TV et la RTBF en Belgique. Je poss\u00e8de \u00e9galement deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de trading bas\u00e9es sur les mati\u00e8res premi\u00e8res.

Pensais-tu avoir une apr\u00e8s-carri\u00e8re aussi riche ? Je m\u2019y suis pr\u00e9par\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s, travailler pour le pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique et devenir membre de la CAF, je ne l\u2019avais pas planifi\u00e9. Comment as-tu organis\u00e9 ton apr\u00e8s-carri\u00e8re ? J\u2019avais un bac L et je n\u2019ai pas attendu la fin de ma carri\u00e8re pour pr\u00e9parer la suite. D\u2019ailleurs, j\u2019y ai pens\u00e9 toute ma vie, \u00e7a se traduisait dans mon comportement et mon \u00e9tat d\u2019esprit. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire ? Je suis quelqu\u2019un de vrai, qui dit ce qu\u2019il pense. J\u2019ai toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9 par les co\u00e9quipiers et dirigeants avec qui je travaillais. Je viens d\u2019un quartier populaire : la Goutte d\u2019or (dans le 18e arrondissement de Paris, ndlr) o\u00f9 on n\u2019a pas l\u2019habitude de se cacher. Tu me respectes, je te respecte. M\u00eame avec les gens avec qui je m\u2019entends moins, il y a toujours ce respect. Mon p\u00e8re me disait : \u00ab Qu\u2019on ait peur de toi ou non, t\u00f4t au tard, tu rencontreras quelqu\u2019un qui te fera du mal. Mais quand les gens te donnent le respect, ils h\u00e9siteront toujours \u00e0 te faire du mal. \u00bb Quelle relation as-tu entretenue avec ton p\u00e8re ? Il a fait de moi un homme. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas du genre \u00e0 lever la main sur moi ou \u00e0 crier. Mes parents sont tous les deux d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s aujourd\u2019hui, mais je ne pense pas que j\u2019aurais pu avoir meilleure \u00e9ducation. Tu es n\u00e9 \u00e0 Dakar, c\u2019est \u00e7a ? Oui, et j\u2019en suis parti \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 7 ans. Je suis arriv\u00e9 en France pour entrer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole primaire. Mon p\u00e8re \u00e9tait un ancien tirailleur s\u00e9n\u00e9galais. Ensuite, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dans la gendarmerie, puis il est reparti en France \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 70. Moi, je suis n\u00e9 au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, alors que mes fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 en France. Tu es pass\u00e9 par le PSG ? Oui, chez les jeunes. D\u2019ailleurs, Paris est toujours mon \u00e9quipe pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e ! J\u2019y ai obtenu mes premi\u00e8res vraies chaussures de foot, des Le coq sportif, sponsor de l\u2019\u00e9poque. Ensuite, je suis retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Goutte d\u2019or avant d\u2019aller au Red Star. Pourquoi es-tu parti en Belgique \u00e0 la fin de saison 1994 ? Le Red Star a refus\u00e9 de me faire signer professionnel. Mon p\u00e8re \u00e9tait encore \u00e9boueur, ma m\u00e8re femme de m\u00e9nage \u00e0 Barb\u00e8s. J\u2019avais besoin d\u2019avoir un peu d\u2019argent. Pas pour faire la java, mais pour aider mes parents qui avaient du mal \u00e0 joindre les deux bouts. La Belgique est venue \u00e0 moi par \u00c9ric Gerets. Il m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de passer. Je suis venu, il m\u2019a fait jouer et apr\u00e8s 45 minutes, je signais pro \u00e0 18 ans au RFC Li\u00e8ge. Apr\u00e8s plus de 7 ans pass\u00e9s l\u00e0-bas, tu n\u2019as jamais pens\u00e9 \u00e0 jouer pour les Diables rouges ? J\u2019ai eu une proposition \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 Georges Leekens \u00e9tait s\u00e9lectionneur. Le Premier ministre de Dehaene et Gerets m\u2019avaient aussi encourag\u00e9, mais \u00e7a ne m\u2019a jamais effleur\u00e9 l\u2019esprit. J\u2019ai toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9 \u00abS\u00e9n\u00e9gal\u00bb. Je voulais jouer pour la terre de mes parents, de mes grands-parents, de mes anc\u00eatres. En fait, la question ne s\u2019est jamais pos\u00e9e pour moi. Comprends-tu par exemple que des Fran\u00e7ais, choisissent de jouer pour le pays de leurs parents ? Bien s\u00fbr. La nationalit\u00e9, ce n\u2019est pas les papiers, mais une affaire de c\u0153ur. Bruno Metsu \u00e9tait fran\u00e7ais, il est devenu s\u00e9n\u00e9galais. Chacun son c\u0153ur, chacun son envie ou ses principes. On n\u2019a pas le droit de juger. Apr\u00e8s, ce qui m\u2019agace, c\u2019est ceux qui le choisissent par d\u00e9faut. Je n\u2019ai pas \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 par la France, du coup j\u2019ai choisi le S\u00e9n\u00e9gal. \u00c7a me met hors de moi. Comment s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 ton transfert \u00e0 Auxerre en 2000 ? Guy Roux m\u2019a mis la main dessus et m\u2019a dit : \u00ab Tu viens ! \u00bb C\u2019est comme \u00e7a, grossi\u00e8rement, que \u00e7a s\u2019est pass\u00e9. Il est venu avec Gerard Bourgoin (le pr\u00e9sident, ndlr) en Belgique. J\u2019\u00e9tais encore \u00e0 Bruges \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. J\u2019avais d\u2019autres propositions, mais Guy Roux et Pape Diouf, mon agent, ont su me convaincre. J\u2019ai donc donn\u00e9 ma parole. Mais par la suite, j\u2019ai parl\u00e9 avec ma femme en lui disant : \u00ab Mais o\u00f9 c\u2019est Auxerre ? \u00bb On a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 sur la carte, on s\u2019est rendus l\u00e0-bas. J\u2019\u00e9tais un peu r\u00e9ticent, mais Pape m\u2019a rappel\u00e9 quelque chose d\u2019important que m\u2019avait dit mon p\u00e8re : \u00ab Il faut toujours tenir sa parole. \u00bb Donc j\u2019y suis all\u00e9. Je ne reviens jamais sur ma parole ! Ton retour dans l\u2019Hexagone, \u00e9tait-ce une revanche vis-\u00e0-vis du foot fran\u00e7ais ? Non, du tout. Le pied de nez s\u2019est produit lorsque j\u2019ai su que des dirigeants du Red Star \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents lors de la finale qu\u2019on a gagn\u00e9e face au PSG (2-1 en 2003). \u00c0 la fin du match ils m\u2019ont demand\u00e9 mon maillot. J\u2019ai gentiment refus\u00e9. Dans une vid\u00e9o, Djibril Ciss\u00e9 a salu\u00e9 ta facult\u00e9 d\u2019adaptation lors de ton arriv\u00e9e en Bourgogne. C\u2019est peut-\u00eatre gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 Guy Roux. Il a su voir mes points faibles et mes points forts. Il ne m\u2019a jamais fait jouer contre nature, ni emp\u00each\u00e9 de dribbler ou de prendre mes responsabilit\u00e9s. Et puis on est de l\u2019\u00e9cole fran\u00e7aise. Elle aime le beau jeu, pas les bourrins. On aime ceux qui jouent au ballon, et je pense que \u00e7a a facilit\u00e9 mon int\u00e9gration. Guy Roux a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 r\u00e9unir des joueurs qui aimaient \u00eatre ensemble. Selon lui, tu \u00e9tais parmi les cinq meilleurs du monde \u00e0 ton poste. J\u2019ai toujours essay\u00e9 de bonifier les \u00e9quipes dans lesquelles je jouais. J\u2019\u00e9tais appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 et respect\u00e9. C\u2019est ce qui a fait ma carri\u00e8re. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, des anciens co\u00e9quipiers m\u2019appellent toujours. Lors de son dernier match (en 2005), Fernando Hierro m\u2019a donn\u00e9 son maillot. Je lui ai demand\u00e9 pourquoi. Il m\u2019a r\u00e9pondu : \u00ab Parce que je t\u2019appr\u00e9cie. \u00bb Les gars de mon quartier sont plus fiers de ce que j\u2019ai fait que moi-m\u00eame. Ils se d\u00e9pla\u00e7aient, pas pour le joueur, mais pour l\u2019homme parce qu\u2019on a v\u00e9cu plein de choses ensemble. Tu donnes du respect, de l\u2019affection aux gens, ils te le rendent. En revanche, parfois, tu dois aussi te comporter en homme et ne pas te laisser marcher dessus. Tu d\u00e9gages de la s\u00e9r\u00e9nit\u00e9. Je d\u00e9gage de la s\u00e9r\u00e9nit\u00e9, car tout ce qui arrive, c\u2019est Dieu qui te le donne. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas mauvais, c\u2019est forc\u00e9ment quelque chose qui te sera b\u00e9n\u00e9fique. Par exemple, lorsque j\u2019ai sign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Inter, j\u2019\u00e9tais heureux, pour moi c\u2019\u00e9tait le Graal. Et l\u00e0, on m\u2019annonce que j\u2019ai un probl\u00e8me au c\u0153ur. J\u2019avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 sign\u00e9 mon contrat, j\u2019avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 tout fait. Mais qui dit que s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas vu \u00e7a, je serais encore vivant aujourd\u2019hui ? Donc c\u2019est comme \u00e7a que je vois les choses. C\u2019est ma ligne de conduite. J\u2019ai 41 ans aujourd\u2019hui, et il n\u2019est pas question que je change. Et je sais que mon p\u00e8re et ma m\u00e8re me regardent. Elle te vient d\u2019o\u00f9, cette force ? Mon p\u00e8re \u00e9tait \u00e9boueur. Il se levait \u00e0 4 heures du matin pour aller ramasser les poubelles. Ma m\u00e8re \u00e9tait femme de m\u00e9nage. Elle nettoyait, et les gens repassaient pour salir son travail. Quand tu as vu \u00e7a, plus rien ne te fait peur. Tu ne peux pas t\u2019apitoyer sur ton sort. Je fais ce que des milliards de personnes r\u00eaveraient de faire. Je fais partie de ces millions de personnes qui r\u00e9ussissent, de ces milliers de personnes connues, de cette minorit\u00e9 de personnes respect\u00e9es qui ont eu la chance de jouer la Coupe du monde. Comment veux-tu que je me plaigne ? Comment peut-on d\u00e9finir ton style de jeu ? Comment me vois-tu, toi ? Comme un meneur de jeu. Oui voil\u00e0. J\u2019\u00e9tais un passeur, un meneur de jeu, un dribbleur, un \u00ab bonificateur \u00bb . \u00c0 quel poste pr\u00e9f\u00e9rais-tu \u00e9voluer ? Dans l\u2019axe. C\u2019est l\u00e0 o\u00f9 je me sens le mieux. Mais \u00e0 Auxerre, tu jouais sur un c\u00f4t\u00e9. Oui. Guy disait que j\u2019avais plus de facult\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre qu\u2019Olivier Kapo. Mais quand il ne jouait pas, c\u2019est moi qu\u2019on balan\u00e7ait dans l\u2019axe. Wow ! Je pense que c\u2019est Jean Alain qui fait une sortie de la d\u00e9fense. Il tente un une-deux, mais il est contr\u00e9. Le ballon rebondit quelques m\u00e8tres devant moi, je sprinte pour lober Seaman du plat du pied. En fait, avec la vitesse, je ne tape pas le ballon, je le d\u00e9pose. Car si je frappe, \u00e7a passe au-dessus, donc je mets juste un plat du pied ! Un grand moment pour le foot fran\u00e7ais\u2026 Oui, c\u2019\u00e9tait aussi un grand moment pour nous. Nous \u00e9tions face \u00e0 cette \u00e9quipe d\u2019Arsenal qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 battue depuis je ne sais combien de temps, \u00e0 Highbury. Et puis c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e9quipe de Patoche (Vieira), Thierry (Henry)\u2026 Que des Fran\u00e7ais, c\u2019\u00e9tait chouette ! Parle-moi de Guy Roux. \u00c0 chaque match, il avait une anecdote \u00e0 raconter. Tu jouais contre une 4e division, il te mettait tellement dans la position de l\u2019outsider que tu \u00e9tais oblig\u00e9 de te donner \u00e0 fond. Tu te dis, le mec finalement est plombier, mais c\u2019est peut-\u00eatre juste un manque de chance. Guy Roux te faisait croire qu\u2019il aurait pu devenir pro, s\u2019il avait eu un peu plus de r\u00e9ussite. \u00c7a te donne envie de te d\u00e9passer, de faire l\u2019exploit. C\u2019est le meilleur entra\u00eeneur que tu aies eu ? Psychologiquement, Guy Roux est tr\u00e8s fin, tr\u00e8s subtil. Apr\u00e8s, tactiquement, \u00c9ric Gerets et Bruno Metsu, c\u2019est tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s haut. Tu as commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9voquer plus haut, comment s\u2019est pass\u00e9 ton transfert \u00e0 l\u2019Inter Milan ? \u00c7a s\u2019est pass\u00e9 avant la Coupe du monde. Lors d\u2019une interview en live avec Guy Roux, El-Hadji Diouf a vendu la m\u00e8che en lui disant \u00ab Vous savez Monsieur Roux, Khalilou a d\u00e9j\u00e0 sign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Inter ! \u00bb J\u2019avais promis au pr\u00e9sident Moratti que j\u2019irai \u00e0 l\u2019Inter, j\u2019y suis all\u00e9. M\u00eame si apr\u00e8s avoir donn\u00e9 ma parole, plusieurs autres \u00e9quipes me demandaient. Qu\u2019est-ce que \u00e7a repr\u00e9sentait pour toi ? J\u2019ai pens\u00e9 au chemin parcouru. J\u2019avais dit que gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 Dieu et \u00e0 mes parents, j\u2019y arriverai. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 eux, j\u2019y suis arriv\u00e9. J\u2019ai sign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Inter. Ils sont venus me chercher avec un contrat de 4 ans. Malheureusement, ton probl\u00e8me cardiaque t\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9 d\u2019y jouer. Oui, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 interdit de jeu par le comit\u00e9 olympique, non pas par le m\u00e9decin du club. C\u2019\u00e9tait la fin de tout. J\u2019ai rarement l\u2019habitude de pleurer, mais l\u00e0 j\u2019ai pleur\u00e9 m\u00eame devant des inconnus, Massimo Moratti et Marco Branca. Quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 leur r\u00e9action ? Monsieur Moratti, tr\u00e8s digne, Pape Diouf, tr\u00e8s classe. Moratti a tout fait pour que je joue, mais le m\u00e9decin ne voulait prendre aucun risque, donc le pr\u00e9sident a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 : si \u00e7a ne s\u2019arrangeait pas, il me payait deux ans de contrat. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019il a fait. Classe\u2026 Moratti, tout le monde le sait, Ronaldo l\u2019a dit, c\u2019est un grand, un tr\u00e8s grand monsieur, il a un c\u0153ur \u00e9norme. Malgr\u00e9 ce revers, tu rebondis \u00e0 Bolton en Angleterre, mais l\u00e0-bas, tu es victime d\u2019une attaque cardiaque. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9chauffement d\u2019un match de coupe contre Tottenham, j\u2019ai eu un malaise. Mon docteur a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 prendre les devants en me posant un d\u00e9fibrillateur derri\u00e8re les c\u00f4tes. Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019on m\u2019a implant\u00e9 \u00e7a, j\u2019ai pu continuer \u00e0 jouer. Aujourd\u2019hui, la chance que j\u2019ai, sauf rappel du Tout-Puissant, c\u2019est de ne pas pouvoir subir d\u2019arr\u00eat cardiaque parce que j\u2019ai un d\u00e9fibrillateur \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de moi. Ta fa\u00e7on d\u2019appr\u00e9hender le football a-t-elle chang\u00e9 avant et apr\u00e8s l\u2019op\u00e9ration ? Non, j\u2019ai toujours gard\u00e9 cet amusement et cette volont\u00e9 de montrer aux sceptiques que Khali est l\u00e0, faire plaisir \u00e0 mes proches, mes supporters et \u00e0 moi-m\u00eame. Certaines personnes ont pri\u00e9 pour moi, alors que je ne les connaissais pas, je me devais d\u2019\u00eatre noble sur le terrain. Comment as-tu v\u00e9cu, \u00e0 titre personnel, la Coupe du monde 2002 ? Pour moi c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019apoth\u00e9ose. Pas seulement par le fait de battre la France (1-0), mais Dieu a fait qu\u2019on tombait face aux gars qu\u2019on connaissait, des mecs issus d\u2019un pays dans lequel nous \u00e9voluions. Nous sommes tous franco-s\u00e9n\u00e9galais. Ces gars, on les c\u00f4toyait dans les centres de formation, et puis la France, c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019ancienne colonie. On se devait de les battre. Pendant l\u2019hymne face \u00e0 la France, tu souris, \u00e0 quoi penses-tu ? J\u2019ai eu un flashback de tout ce que j\u2019ai v\u00e9cu. J\u2019ai pens\u00e9 \u00e0 ma famille et \u00e0 mes potes de quartier, les gars de la Goutte d\u2019or. Je me suis dit : \u00ab Ces imb\u00e9ciles-l\u00e0 (rire)avec l\u2019hymne, ils vont tous \u00eatre devant la t\u00e9l\u00e9 et au moment o\u00f9 on va me voir ils crieront \u201cPopopo, il est l\u00e0. Ils vont se foutre de ma gueule (rires)\u201d. \u00bb Petits, je leur avais dit que je jouerais la Coupe du monde. Certains Fran\u00e7ais ne comprennent pas l\u2019importance d\u2019une telle victoire face \u00e0 la France. C\u2019est difficile pour eux de comprendre parce que l\u2019histoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite \u00e0 leur avantage. La France, le pays dominant, champion du monde, le colonisateur et toutes ces choses-l\u00e0. C\u2019\u00e9tait comme si le Br\u00e9sil tapait le Portugal. Pour le S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose. Sur le continent africain, nous sommes consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme les petits Fran\u00e7ais. C\u2019est jouer contre les gens auxquels on a envie d\u2019expliquer : \u00ab On a le total respect, mais nous avons un d\u00e9tachement. Le S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, c\u2019est chez nous. Nous ne sommes plus les colonis\u00e9s. \u00bb Tout \u00e7a est entr\u00e9 en jeu. On jouait pour nous, nos parents, nos anc\u00eatres, on jouait pour l\u2019histoire du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, mais sans aucun esprit de revanche. Avant la rencontre, on ne vous a pas pris au s\u00e9rieux. Oui, \u00e7a nous a galvanis\u00e9s dans le combat psychologique qu\u2019on a eu avec les Fran\u00e7ais. Ce manque de reconnaissance, ce manque de respect, d\u2019humilit\u00e9 de leur part, nous a agac\u00e9s. On repense \u00e0 la phrase de Michel Platini : \u00ab On ne boxe pas dans la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie \u00bb \u2026 Des phrases assassines, y en a eu. Platini qui dit \u00e7a, Pel\u00e9 qui d\u00e9clare que nous serons les Jama\u00efcains de cette Coupe du monde. Marcel Desailly parlait d\u2019un match folklorique. M\u00eame le s\u00e9lectionneur (Roger Lemerre, ndlr) nous a manqu\u00e9 de respect. Il ne connaissait que Diouf, Toni Sylva et moi, alors que beaucoup d\u2019entre nous jouaient en France. Les Danois et les Uruguayens, il les connaissait tous. Selon leurs dires, ils allaient nous enjamber, m\u00eame pas nous \u00e9craser, nous \u00ab em-jam-ber \u00bb ! C\u2019est encore pire ! On s\u2019est dit : \u00ab Eux, faut qu\u2019on les mette bien \u00bb et on les a mis bien. Les seuls qui nous ont respect\u00e9, mais je pense que c\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 l\u2019amiti\u00e9 qui nous liait, c\u2019\u00e9tait Henry, Ciss\u00e9, Wiltord et Pir\u00e8s. Vous saviez que vous alliez gagner ? On savait qu\u2019on allait les fumer ! C\u2019\u00e9tait clair et net. On est venus avec le couteau entre les dents. Tu n\u2019imagines pas si on avait perdu, l\u2019humiliation pour nous, nos parents, nos anc\u00eatres et le pays. Tu imagines ! On ne pouvait pas perdre ! Avec le recul, certains diront que c\u2019est facile de parler maintenant ! Pourtant on l\u2019avait dit dans le DVD La Tani\u00e8re des Lions. Et puis le pr\u00e9sident Wade l\u2019avait dit : \u00ab Comment un coq peut-il venir terrasser un lion ? \u00bb Qu\u2019est-ce que tu retiens le plus, acc\u00e9der aux quarts ou le match face \u00e0 la France ? Franchement, je n\u2019enl\u00e8ve rien, je prends tout. Chaque moment a son importance. On ne pourra jamais m\u2019enlever ces moments-l\u00e0. Est-ce qu\u2019il ne manque pas \u00e0 ta g\u00e9n\u00e9ration un titre en Coupe d\u2019Afrique pour \u00eatre \u00e0 la hauteur de la l\u00e9gende ? Oui, sans doute. Si je te dis que tu \u00e9tais meilleur qu\u2019El-Hadji Diouf ? Non, on est diff\u00e9rents. M\u00eame si lorsqu\u2019il a re\u00e7u le deuxi\u00e8me Ballon d\u2019or africain, il m\u2019a dit qu\u2019il pensait que j\u2019allais l\u2019obtenir. Certains diront que je suis plus technique, qu\u2019il est un petit peu individualiste, mais c\u2019est son r\u00f4le. Dans son domaine, c\u2019\u00e9tait le meilleur et dans le mien, j\u2019\u00e9tais l\u2019un des meilleurs. Que penses-tu de son comportement \u00ab reew \u00bb (impoli en wollof, ndlr) ? Ce sont les gens qui le voient comme \u00e7a, donc c\u2019est compliqu\u00e9 de dire qu\u2019il l\u2019est, parce qu\u2019avec moi, il ne l\u2019est pas. Apr\u00e8s, on a un comportement diff\u00e9rent l\u2019un de l\u2019autre. Il reste mon ami et, avec moi, il ne peut pas le faire. Je pense qu\u2019il dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00e0 sa mani\u00e8re. On n\u2019est pas pareils, mais je ne peux pas expliquer pourquoi les gens le voient comme \u00e7a. Je pense que c\u2019est \u00e7a qu\u2019il leur montre. Mais ce qui est s\u00fbr, c\u2019est qu\u2019il a donn\u00e9 beaucoup de bonheur au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal. On ne peut pas demander \u00e0 un humain d\u2019\u00eatre parfait. Il ne faut pas regarder Diouf qu\u2019\u00e0 travers les crachats, ce serait tr\u00e8s r\u00e9ducteur.

There are many types of home businesses to choose from, and the world out there is pretty cut-throat. It is important that you know what you are facing and what you need before you begin the endeavor of running your own business from home. Read further for more information.\n\nTrade your products with other home businesses. This increases the visibility of your product and your business. It also creates solid, long-lasting relationships with other individuals in similar situations. These connections could prove helpful in the future, so it is best to maintain as many as possible. If you are not sure where to begin, use the internet as a resource.\n\nDon't forget the paperwork. Make sure you have filled out all local and state requirements to operate your home business. All of these forms will ensure that you don't fall into trouble and you'll appreciate having done things the right way at tax time. Make sure to keep duplicates of everything.\n\nRegister your home business with your local chamber of commerce. Sometimes it's hard to advertise a home business inexpensively, but you can become well-known in your community by letting your chamber of commerce know where you are. People looking for your type of business can inquire and get helpful information, which will help you also. And it won't cost you anything!\n\nIt is important to not use your home address as the mailing address for your home business. It could be very dangerous to allow people to know your home address. Thieves or worse could come to your home and try to rob you because they know that you have products in your home. To avoid being robbed you should use a PO Box as the mailing address for your business.\n\nIf you are ready to form your business, think about what legal steps you are required to take. You will need to decide if you want to form your business as a sole proprietorship, partnership or corporation. Your business will need a license or permit, in order to operate. Depending on the type of business, you might need to get special insurance. Making sure that you address all the legal issues, will protect you and your clients from any legal misunderstanding.\n\nSubmit your business website to all of the major search engines. This way your pages get ranked in the search engines, which means they will start showing up in the search results within several weeks. Learn about search engine optimization so that you can tailor your web page text to get picked up faster by the search engines.\n\nYour home business should have promotional materials galore. Some websites have exceptional deals on business cards, so look out for deals. Either way, a professional, streamlined business card will make your business look efficient and organized. Your customers will also have a handy reference to keep on hand for future transactions.\n\nDo not be afraid to post your email address on your web site. Make sure that you include it on every separate page that you have. You do not want potential customers to search to figure out how to get in touch with you. The more effort that it takes them, the more likely they are to go on to something else without purchasing from you.\n\nDo not be afraid to post your email address on your web site. Make sure that you include it on every separate page that you have. You do not want potential customers to search to figure out how to get in touch with you. The more effort that it takes them, the more likely they are to go on to something else without purchasing from you.\n\nDo not start your business without checking with an accountant first. No one wants to upset the IRS so make sure you have everything in line before collecting your first dollar. If your state has sales taxes, make sure to find out how you need to handle them for your business.\n\nStart out your home business by finding your niche. This is going to be the only way you can work towards success, as a niche defines and describes your business while clarifying your main function. If you are unsure of your niche, you could find yourself working aimlessly and exceeding your business capacity.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nBy investing enough time and effort into lead generation for small business , you can make sure that your business is properly situated for future growth.

WARRENSBURG, Mo. (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 The Mules raced out to a fast start this year with the help of the newest member of the football team. The University of Central Missouri\u2019s Walton Stadium received brand new, cutting edge athletic turf this summer from AstroTurf\u00ae. The state-of-the-art turf field was put in by Mid-America Sports Construction, a certified AstroTurf installer. Walton Stadium at Kennedy Field now features AstroTurf\u2019s RootZone 3D3 Blend synthetic turf system. The RootZone 3D3 Blend is a premium product that combines slit film and monofilament fibers for optimum durability and structural integrity. It is highlighted by AstroTurf\u2019s patented RootZone sub-layer, a texturized fiber that stabilizes infill and improves shock absorbency. The new stadium turf combines exceptional performance with game day good looks, as double alternating panels give the field an eye-popping design. \u201cWhen it came time to replace the artificial turf at Walton Stadium, we wanted to get the best product possible,\u201d said Scott Thomason, the assistant athletic director of facilities. \u201cAstroTurf and their partners enabled us to put in an incredible field, stress-free, in plenty of time for opening kickoff. Their continued excellence in customer service and support separates AstroTurf from their competitors.\u201d Central Missouri\u2019s procurement of the brand new football field was made possible by AstroTurf\u2019s association with National IPA. National IPA is the nation\u2019s leading cooperative purchasing organization. They offer a portfolio of competitively solicited contracts that have been awarded based on industry best practices and maximum value. It saves institutions like Central Missouri time and money by eliminating the administrative costs and hassles of running competitive solicitations on their own. Head Coach Jim Svoboda and the Mules football team seem to be enjoying their new home field advantage, as UCM finished 4 and 1 at Walton Stadium, including three wins where the offense has scored over 50 points. The Mules finished 9-3 capping off an excellent season with a 38-28 victory over Minnesota-Duluth in the Mineral Water Bowl. About AstroTurf\u00aeFor athletes and sport enthusiasts, AstroTurf\u00ae has redefined the way the game is played. The brand offers advanced, state-of-the-art, multi-sport and specialized synthetic turf systems with proprietary engineered technologies.

Sunrise can accommodate the printing, folding, addressing and mailing all in one shot. \nCHICAGO (PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nThere is something special about a paper holiday card arriving in the mail; it just feels more personal than email or text greetings. Even so, in this digital age, many people are going the easy route instead of dealing with the hassle of writing and mailing paper cards. Now what if there was an easy way to send traditional paper greeting cards without the same old headaches? that\u2019s where Sunrise comes in. \nMany websites already offer customized greeting cards, but most of them fall short in terms of quality, speed, or service. Holiday greeting cards from Sunrise Hitek take holiday cards to the next level. They offer a huge variety of options from paper: white, color, pearlescent, translucent, or metallic, envelopes: standard or custom to other more exotic materials such as clear film, frosted polycarbonate, rigid vinyl and other synthetic substrates. \nOne highly custom option is opaque white ink which is available for printing on clear and colored substrates. White ink can be printed under, over, or blended with 4-color elements for special effects. New, heavy substrates up to 18pt cover or 20pt rigid vinyl are great for heavier ornament cards. Choose from common card sizes 4.5\u201dx6\u201d, 5\u201dx7\u201d, 5.5\u201dx8.5\u201d or any custom size. Sunrise provides a turn-key solution to card sending with in-house mailing and fulfillment. Simply provide artwork and mailing list and Sunrise will take it from there. \nAnother exciting service is their new laser-cutting feature. Highly intricate laser-cutting allows for the most delicate of internal cuts to be made. Names can be cut, silhouettes, even complicated cuts such as buildings in the Chicago skyline. Laser-cutting will add pizzazz to regular Christmas and New year cards. \nSunrise Hitek guarantees the highest quality standards in their holiday card printing. The Indigo process ensures, sharp, detailed color reproduction which is a must in photo cards as well as full bleed printing at no additional charge. Sunrise does all this in a cost-effective manner with best-in-the-business turnaround times, perfect for those holiday procrastinators. \nAbout Sunrise Hitek Group, LLC. Sunrise Hitek was established in 1988 and employs the most advanced equipment and technology, such as G7-certified HP Indigo and UV flatbed presses, laser engraving, and digital die-cutting, to create best-in-class color printing, short-run packaging, P.O.P. retail displays, and signage products.

Very gradual. Come 2020, we roll out Standard Six. \n\u201cBy the time we will be finishing the current system, we shall have taken about seven years. Is that really a hurried process? This is done very professionally,\" Dr Jwan was quoted by the Nation . \nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Education on Monday launched the selection of students into secondary schools. \nThe best student in the October Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) Goldalyn Kakuya was selected to join Kenya High School. \nAll other students who did KCPE were advised to follow up on their selection by sending a text to a given code. \n\"As we did last year, students who cleared class eight will be required to send their index numbers to 20042 to know which secondary schools they will be joining and also to print their admission letters,\u201dEducation CS Fred Matiang'i stated. \"File ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rodgers omondi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "goldalyn kakuya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred matiang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julius jwan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jwan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of education", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya institute of curriculum development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "october kenya certificate of primary education", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "standard four", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya high school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kepsha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya primary school heads association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kcpe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of education cs fred matiang", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:19.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be5c2c8bf240f3d5eca530cbeb85d435d0efec7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS.kFa3DkE_CkVOCD8bGhF4tvpdajGZ1FsWK0z0QieqgTPDFxh7mRAjckUv6D1l4CLGAzMMIwkfFXXYMC.u24e1Gi9XlKj3l.sIRCmcgADTGQ-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mexico/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/Mexico: Aqu\u00ed empieza la patria.", "title": "My new wallpaper, shot on IPhone 7 (Castillo de Chapultepec)", "title_full": "My new wallpaper, shot on IPhone 7 (Castillo de Chapultepec) : mexico", "published": "2017-12-07T08:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.802, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be5c2c8bf240f3d5eca530cbeb85d435d0efec7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS.kFa3DkE_CkVOCD8bGhF4tvpdajGZ1FsWK0z0QieqgTPDFxh7mRAjckUv6D1l4CLGAzMMIwkfFXXYMC.u24e1Gi9XlKj3l.sIRCmcgADTGQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ElFettyWop", "published": "2017-12-07T08:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "My new wallpaper, shot on IPhone 7 (Castillo de Chapultepec)", "text": "submitted by /u/ElFettyWop\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://i.redd.it/5pfa6oppxf201.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:05:20.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8685c634b8e67a68682108ad883211b897f90c28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9F_yf.l4Qe0vclufdhfYzbxjF.wB.6MahMSdvVJFlv9Ys1tEEhOEdi.gXmREMNjwVpqRKW8CQXYeukwA5XkYbk", "site_full": "www.fightercontrol.co.uk", "site": "fightercontrol.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.fightercontrol.co.uk/forum/viewforum.php?f=19", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Airshow &amp; Event Photography \u2022 FighterControl \u2022 Home to the Military Aviation Enthusiast ", "title": "Mig-21 heaven, Campia Turzii - Romania", "title_full": "Mig-21 heaven, Campia Turzii - Romania \u2022 FighterControl \u2022 Home to the Military Aviation Enthusiast", "published": "2017-12-06T22:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e8cdbe9301c4e73abe8754163e7907a67f9e4508", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9F_yf.l4Qe0vclufdhfYzbxjF.wB.6MahMSdvVJFlv9Ys1tEEhOEdi.gXmREMNjwVpqRKW8CQXYYcAIqeuBzLkQcZPOqlIK2g-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Sparts99", "published": "2017-12-07T11:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "No need to apologise for posting so many.

Unfortunately, sexual harassment is common and has been a problem well before the recent nationwide dialogue on the issue surfaced after countless women have come forward. \n\u201cSexual harassment is a form of gender discrimination. It is unwelcomed sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal (i.e. sexual jokes), physical (i.e. battery), visual (i.e. graphic sexual photos) or written conduct (i.e. text messages) of a sexual nature,\u201d said renowned civil and workers\u2019 rights attorney Toni Jaramilla , who was recently interviewed by CBC Player about sexual harassment in the film industry. \u201cSexual harassment is often about power, especially in \u2018quid pro quo\u2019 harassment, where an employee is expected to provide sexual favors in exchange for job benefit or avoidance of job detriment.\u201d \nIn order to further educate California employees on sexual harassment, Jaramilla, who was also featured in Law360 discussing how lawyers are challenging Weinstein-style contracts, lists the following three tips: \nNo. 1: Report the conduct in writing to management. \u201cIf you are being sexually harassed, report the conduct to HR or anyone in management in writing. Although employers are obligated to promptly investigate all reports, including verbal reports, it is best to document your report in writing so that there is a written record which shows the date and nature of your report. Once your report is made, the employer\u2019s obligation to conduct a prompt, unbiased investigation is triggered,\u201d stressed Jaramilla. \nIf the harassment rises to the level of criminal conduct like sexual assault or rape, report it to law enforcement. \u201cRemember that the laws protect you from being retaliated against for reporting sexual harassment in the workplace,\u201d added Jramilla. \u201cThus, if you are demoted or terminated after reporting sexual harassment, you may have an additional claim for retaliation.\u201d \nNo. 2: Preserve the evidence. Keep track of dates of incidents, individuals involved and possible witnesses. Save emails, text messages or phone messages that evidence sexual advances or other inappropriate conduct. \u201cYou will need this when an investigation is conducted and in the likely event that the harasser denies the allegations,\u201d noted Jaramilla. \nNo. 3: Protect your emotional and mental health. Being sexually harassed is humiliating and frightening. \u201cThe residual embarrassment and psychological and emotional trauma can be debilitating for the victim,\u201d concluded Jaramilla. \u201cSeek mental health treatment or confide in a trusted friend or family member for emotional support.\u201d \nAbout Toni Jaramilla, A Professional Law Corporation Toni Jaramilla is committed to achieving the best possible results for employees who have experienced problems in the workplace.

Unfortunately, it is all too often the choice of packing material, and it doesn't sit too well with my Earth-lovin' self.

(I also listed it on a local Swap site, hoping that maybe some art teachers could find a use for it. So far, no takers.) \n\nWith a few other materials, the winter project was begun. The white strofoam reminded me of snow or ice, so I thought it might be a good idea to fashion snow people out of the remnants. \n\nUsing a pencil, details were outlined on the foam, and then traced over with markers and paint. \n\nThese skewers were used to attach the heads to the bodies.

(PRWEB) December 07, 2017 \nA revocable living trust is the most common form of estate planning in California, and creates an entity that allows for the bypassing of the probate system. \u201cInstead of going through probate it goes to the trustee you\u2019ve appointed,\u201d said estate planning attorney Adam Diran , co-founder of Diran & Grey. \u201cHowever, the trustee only has direct access to assets that are titled into the trust. No asset is in a trust unless it has a title document that says that it is in the trust.\u201d \nTo further educate people about revocable living trusts and estate planning , Diran shares the following two tips, which are not to be taken as legal advice and are only meant for public service. \nNo. 1: Transfer all financial assets into the trust. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered that the majority of people who come into my office, about 60%, have made an error that ruins their estate plan,\u201d noted Diran. \u201cMost people never fund their trusts. For example, for a house typically held as \u2018Mr. and Mrs. Smith, husband and wife,\u2019 what their deed needs to say is \u2018Mr. and Mrs. Smith as trustees for Mr. and Mrs. Smith trust...\u2019\u201d \nPeople need to transfer not just their homes, but all their financial assets into the trust. For example, brokerage accounts. \u201cThey realize their house has a deed, they don\u2019t think their bank account has a title doc, and it does,\u201d added Diran. \u201cIf you have a trust, all of your assets need to be titled in the trust, otherwise it does nothing for you.\u201d \nNo. 2: Fund the revocable living trust in the future. \u201cFunding doesn\u2019t just mean the accounts you have now; it also means the accounts you open next week, next year, or ten years from now,\u201d stressed Diran. \u201cThe issue is not just trusts that aren\u2019t initially funded but trusts that aren\u2019t maintained. We all go through life opening and closing financial accounts, buying cars, and hopefully buying real estate. This is a very simple issue to deal with. A brief call to your financial institutions to make sure your assets are properly titled could potentially save your children many thousands of dollars in legal fees.\u201d \nThink about creating a trust as creating a big box. \u201cIf you don\u2019t put your assets in the box, the big empty box doesn\u2019t do you any good,\u201d concluded Diran. \u201cSadly, I frequently see people that come in with beautifully written trusts that were never properly funded.\u201d \nAbout Adam Diran, Diran & Grey Adam Diran is a J.D. and an M.B.A. Adam uses his financial expertise to advise clients in estate planning.

I often shut down my computer at the end of the workday but my day has not ended. For the rest of the evening, I respond to emails on my Android phone. When I respond, I BCC myself so those responses will then appear on my laptop when I boot it up in the morning. The problem is that Gmail will not now allow my laptop (windows 10 - Outlook) to download the original messages or my BCC messages once they have been opened on my phone. I was told this was an iMap issue so I changed both the phone and laptop settings to POP and made sure my online gmail account allowed POP. I don't know what else to do.

This practical 2-day training is designed to ensure that the over-arching developmental stages of children are taken into account when utilising EMDR to ensure the correct developmental protocol is used to maximise therapeutic benefit to the child and their family  During the training, an overview of working systemically with children will be taught alongside the technical modifications of standard EMDR components by age groups (toddler, pre-school aged children, school aged children and teenagers), supported by videos of children with which the different developmental protocols are used.   In addition, practical skills such as the adaptations required in explaining EMDR to children, eliciting a safe place appropriate to the child\u2019s age and developmental stage, stretching the window of tolerance to accommodate improved emotional regulation and examples of how children emotionally regulate differently to adults will be also taught. Finally, a brief introduction to what to do when processing becomes blocked including the use of interweaves with children and the 4-fields group protocol for children will also be shared. \nThis workshop will include practicums and skills-based learning to help consolidate learning and flexibility in the delivery of EMDR with children. \nChildren are in a constant state of chance and evolution: both physiologically, neurologically, cognitively, emotionally and socially.  Children and adolescents do not exist alone but in the context of their families, hence it is impossible to work with a child without taking the context of their system into account \u2013 whether or not the system is physically present.    The emotional and chronological age of the child needs to be taken into account in the language and the developmental protocol used in both understanding and treating the child\u2019s difficulties from both the systemic stance as well as from the child\u2019s own understanding of their difficulties.  In this way, working with children and their families can be seen as equally flexible and challenging. \nSusan Darker-Smith - EMDR Europe Accredited Child & Adolescent Trainer \nSusan is an accredited EMDR Consultant and an accredited Europe Child Trainer who works in a CAMHS team within the NHS alongside her private work.  She has been actively involved in the formation of a National Trauma Response Service in the UK offering group and early intervention EMDR for victims of National terrorist attacks and natural disasters (initially in response to children displaying trauma symptoms in the weeks following the Manchester terror attack). Susan has a wealth of experience in working with complex and dissociative client groups and through this work, she developed an EMDR protocol for working with young people with attachment difficulties and emerging emotional unstable personality disorders.  She has lectured at a national and global level on her research and interventions in both EMDR and CBT. Susan is currently working alongside clinicians both from a paediatric background who work with EMDR and pain and clinicians working with looked after children, to see if different protocol modifications are more effective in helping these specific client groups to recover. Susan currently sits on the EMDR UK & Ireland child and adolescent section alongside being a Trustee of the National Trauma Response Service.   In addition to teaching the EMDR Child Trainings, Susan facilitates for the EMDR Academy and additionally teaches advanced-skills EMDR master-classes. \nEligibility to attend EMDR Europe Part 1 Child Training In order to attend Part 1 of EMDR child training you must have attended a Part 1 and Part 2 of a basic EMDR accredited course, or the old Level 1 Accredited EMDR training.
