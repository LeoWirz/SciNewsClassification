JJ Deveraux will find out what the consequences are for shooting Theo Carver. What does this mean for the detective and how will it affect everyone in Salem? Matt Winkelmeyer / Getty Images for NATAS Taylor Rios \nDays Of Our Lives spoilers for the week of November 11 reveal a decision will be made regarding JJ Deveraux (Casey Moss). Will he be able to keep his job at the Salem police department? Will he get fired as a result of shooting Theo Carver (Kyler Pettis)? How will the decision affect the tormented young man and everyone else in town? \nFor the past few weeks, everyone has been wondering what will happen to JJ on Days Of Our Lives . Spoilers from She Knows confirm a decision about the detective will be made on Friday, December 15. \nEven though he followed police procedures, Abe Carver (James Reynolds) still wants JJ fired. In fact, when Hope Brady (Kristian Alfonso) wouldn\u2019t terminate the detective before the investigation was complete, she ended up losing her own job. \nAbe decided to give Hope\u2019s position to Rafe Hernandez (Galen Gering). However, even the commissioner understands that protocol has to be followed. However, Abe seems more willing to deal with Rafe\u2019s hesitation than Hope\u2019s, most likely because she is related to JJ. \nDays Of Our Lives spoilers do not reveal what happens to JJ. However, it seems that he might end up losing his job for now. That is what Abe wants and since he is the mayor, he has the power to make things difficult if he doesn\u2019t get his way. It is also suggested that JJ gets bad news because around Christmas he tries to kill himself. If he was cleared of any wrongdoing, then things would improve for him, not get worse. \nHowever, there might be something good for JJ in the future. Casey Moss and Sal Stowers spoke at the Days Of Days event and discussed the storyline. It was teased that Lani Price helps JJ get his job back. However, that statement was not referring to the current storyline, but a past one in which JJ was suspended for losing control with Ben Weston (Robert Scott Wilson). \nDuring the conversation, Moss seemed confused about Lani getting him reinstated. That is when Stowers tried to prevent major spoilers from leaking. She made it clear that she has nothing to do with JJ\u2019s career regarding Theo\u2019s shooting. However, when it was hinted that he gets his job back, he seemed to nod in agreement. \nThis seems to imply that JJ will be a detective once again, but not for quite some time. Of course, this is just speculation since the cast would not confirm or deny anything verbally. However, something good must come from the storyline, especially with everything JJ is going through. Fans will just have to wait and see what happens with the character. A post shared by Marci Miller (@_marcimiller_) on Nov 16, 2017 at 9:19pm PST \nDays Of Our Lives airs weekdays on NBC.

READ MORE New biomarkers predict accelerated diabetic eye disease An inhibitor to the enzyme, soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), discovered in the Hammock lab, prevented the eye disease in diabetic mice, Fleming said. The paper, \u201cInhibition of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Prevents Diabetic Retinopathy,\u201d involving six years of research and 22 scientists, is published in the journal Nature. \"This has been a long but exciting project where Dr. Fleming's team used tools developed to study the biology of fatty acid epoxides to probe the fundamental mechanism of diabetic retinopathy,\u201d said co-author Hammock, a distinguished professor of entomology who holds a joint appointment with the UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology and the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center \u201cThis work has targeted many possible sites for intervention that could preserve vision, and one such target is using inhibitors of the soluble epoxide hydrolase which block diabetic retinopathy in mice.\u201d Fleming, who directs Goethe University's Institute for Vascular Signaling, Centre for Molecular Medicine, said a major cause of blindness stems from diabetes \u201cwhere there is a loss of vascular cells in the retina of the eye, loss of barrier function in vessels, edema, and a cascade of inflammatory events leading to blindness.\u201d The eye generates a dihydroxy metabolite from polyunsaturated fatty acids that initiates pericyte loss and breakdown of the endothelial barrier function in the eye, the scientists said. This leads to vascular edema and ultimately to a proliferation of new blood vessels and loss of vision. The small molecule which initiates this process is a diol of a long chain poly unsaturated fatty acid produced by sEH, the researchers said. The enzyme converts an anti-inflammatory epoxy fatty acid into the pro inflammatory and in this case, toxic diol. The research team demonstrated this process and the cellular mechanism involved in diabetic mice and in transgenic mice that over-produce the sEH enzyme. They were able to block the process by inhibiting the sEH enzyme. The expression of the sEH enzyme also increased with severity of diabetic retinopathy in human patients. \u201cThe expression of the soluble epoxide hydrolase gene was shown to increase in the retinas of human patients with the severity of the disease with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy,\u201d Hammock said. \u201cThus, there appears a connection to human medicine.\u201d Diabetic retinopathy is the most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of adult blindness. Chronically high blood sugar from diabetes damages the tiny blood vessels in the retina, leading to diabetic retinopathy, according to the National Eye Institute (NEI) of the National Institutes of Health. The blood vessels can leak fluid or hemorrhage, distorting vision. NEI officials predict that the number of Americans with diabetic retinopathy will nearly double from 7.7 million in 2010 to 14.5 million by 2050. Fleming said the sEH enzyme generates a toxic metabolite, but when the enzyme is inhibited, eye disease is prevented. Earlier work reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences from the Kip Connor laboratory at Harvard University showed that inhibiting the soluble epoxide hydrolase preserves fatty acid epoxides which reduce the late or proliferative stages of diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Now the Fleming team used the same soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors to block production of a pro inflammatory mediator that initiates the early stages of vascular permeability and inflammation of the retina. Connor, an assistant professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, praised the work as bringing to light \u201da previously unknown mechanism of action.\u201d Said Connor: \u201cThe identification by the laboratories of Drs. Fleming and Dr. Hammock that 19,20-dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid, a product of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) activity, as a key regulator of pericyte loss and endothelial barrier breakdown has brought to light a previously unknown mechanism of action in the induction of diabetic retinopathy. Moreover, the authors clearly show that inhibition of sEH blocks formation of this degenerative lipid metabolite thereby halting disease progression, which is of vital interest for the potential management of this blinding disease. Mehran Moghaddam and David Grant, then with the Hammock lab, demonstrated that the diol of the fatty acid linoleate produced by the soluble epoxide hydrolase was highly toxic to cells leading to vascular permeability and sepsis. They published their work in 1997 in Nature Medicine. \"It is interesting how discoveries of years ago resurface as a critical lead in another disease indication,\u201d commented Moghaddam. \u201cIt certainly seems hopeful we will be able to treat blindness resulting from severe diabetes.\" The Hammock laboratory has published almost 900 peer-reviewed papers on the sEH enzyme, discovered while Hammock and Sarjeet Gill (now of UC Riverside) were researching insect developmental biology and green insecticides at UC Berkeley. The work, begun in 1969, led to the discovery that many regulatory molecules are controlled as much by degradation as by biosynthesis, Hammock said. These epoxy fatty acid chemical mediators control blood pressure, fibrosis, immunity, tissue growth, pain and inflammation to name a few processes, and now Fleming's team has shown the diols products from these epoxides can cause diabetic retinopathy.

heads for a win, even as China warning drags down miners", "text": "U.K. stocks edged higher Thursday, aided by a fall for the pound that has been driven by worries over the progress of Brexit negotiations, especially about whether Prime Minister Theresa May can bring warring allies into line over what should come next.\nBut mining shares dragged on London\u2019s blue-chip benchmark, after a warning that Chinese banks may not have enough capital to weather potential losses.\nDeal news was brewing in the betting industry, sending shares of Ladbrokes Coral PLC and William Hill PLC higher in the mid-cap market. \nWhat markets are doing: The FTSE 100 index UKX, +0.22% was up 0.1% at 7,352.36, with tech, industrial and consumer goods shares moving higher. But the basic materials, telecom and oil and gas groups were in the red. On Wednesday, the benchmark rose 0.3%, and a win Thursday would be its second in a row. \nThe pound GBPUSD, -0.0747% traded at $1.3373, down from $1.3394 late Wednesday in New York. Against the euro, sterling GBPEUR, -0.0264% bought \u20ac1.1339, down from \u20ac1.1353. \nWhat\u2019s moving markets: The International Monetary Fund has called for banks in China to bump up their capital buffers in the wake of a credit boom in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. In a review of China\u2019s financial system, the IMF said lenders may not have enough capital to weather potential losses from those credit risks.\nMining stocks in the U.K. can be sensitive to developments in China, where companies are big buyers of precious and industrial metals. \nCloser to home, worries over the progress of Brexit negotiations and in particular the chances for a deal on the Irish border issue have been weighing on the pound and aiding stocks. A weaker pound can help shares of exporters on the FTSE 100, as it boosts the value of foreign sales. Around 75% of revenue for the index\u2019s components are generated overseas. \nInvestors are focused on whether the U.K. can nail a deal on the Irish border, the last of three Brexit issues that have to be resolved before Friday, a deadline set by lead EU negotiator Michel Barnier . EU leaders are meeting Dec. 14-15 in Brussels, where they will assess whether sufficient progress in the U.K. withdrawal talks to move onto the next stage of trade and transition arrangements.\nU.K. Prime Minister Theresa May is working on a new proposal for the Irish border that she will present by Thursday, Ireland\u2019s Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said, according to media reports. A dispute with May\u2019s Northern Ireland political allies over the issue of whether to have a \u201chard\u201d or \u201csoft\u201d border scuttled a potential deal on Monday. \nStock movers: In the basic materials sector, which makes up a roughly 8% weighting on the FTSE 100, shares of Rio Tinto PLC RIO, -0.91% RIO, +0.53% RIO, +0.92% fell 1%, Anglo American PLC AAL, -0.44% lost 0.7%, Fresnillo PLC FRES, +0.16% gave up 0.3%, and BHP Billiton PLC BLT, +0.15% BHP, -0.72% BHP, -0.22% moved 0.2% lower. \nTopping the FTSE 100, broadcaster Sky PLC SKY, +1.92% rose 2.2%. CNBC reported this week that Sky stakeholder 21st Century Fox Inc. FOXA, +0.67% is closing in on a deal to sell some assets to Walt Disney Co. DIS, -1.64% . \nLadbrokes Coral Group PLC LCL, +24.24% surged 26% on the mid-cap FTSE 250 index MCX, +0.23% as the bookmaker is in \u00a33.9 billion takeover talks with GVC Holdings PLC GVC, +4.73% \nWilliam Hill PLC WMH, +3.26% shares climbed 2% as that bookmaker agreed to support Scientific Games Corp.\u2019s SGMS, -0.56% proposed acquisition of NYX Gaming Group Ltd. NYX, -0.42% .

I love to dress and for me that means wearing anything that makes you feel good heels or sneakers rock what you love, dress for yourself. I love fashion, wait until you see what I got \ud83d\udc95.\n\nMY MINI HAUL\n\nI went to a clothing store I haven\u2019t shopped at before, I look around pretty much one whole side of the store \ud83e\udd23 and there was so much cute stuff I would buy. So I had to stick with a bodysuit with jeans style, I shared it in one of my previous posts check it out if you haven\u2019t already and see for yourself how I styled my look. I love maroon and this color paired with the wash of my jeans was a perfect match \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd, there will be more to come stay tuned \ud83d\udc40.\n\n\n\n         \n  \n         \nOutfit and Accessories: Boomy Juniors + Plus size\nSneakers: Jordan Jumpman BG\nMakeup:  Ulta Beauty and Walgreens\n\nThis is the cutest local store ever, I found so much inspiration for new looks in there and I look forward to sharing more with you within the next few weeks. I\u2019m looking forward to doing my Holiday style looks to share as well, keep a eye out for that because those photoshoots will be coming soon \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd. Now I follow them on Instagram, I will for sure be going back to shop there for another haul post and be sure to put together some super good looks for you to see. This was a private campaign, it was my idea to shop at this exact store, but the agreement was just shop where ever I wanted for a few items and share with my fashion dolls \ud83d\ude01 and I hope you like it.\n\nStyling a look makes me feel good about what I\u2019m going to wear, when my outfit is fly and I feel cute     it\u2019s going to be a good day. If you\u2019ve been following me awhile you already know my favorite color is pink, so it\u2019s no surprise I have pink sunglasses \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaf I love the color on the lenses it blends perfect with that shade of pink and my rose gold hoops are the flyest ever ! #StylenistaSquad.\nI love shopping so much I can look around a whole store and leave with at these 2-4 items, it\u2019s hard to pass up cute affordable fashions so I have to leave a clothing store with something each time \ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\udcaf. Lately I\u2019ve been more into makeup and was so happy to finally shop at Ulta Beauty leaving with new make up and brushes, next time I go there I\u2019m for sire leaving with eyeshadow palettes, new brushes and brush cleaners. I love to do my makeup, since I\u2019ve been doing it for awhile and watch some tutorials on Instagram and YouTube I\u2019m getting better at having my makeup on fleek #GlamDoll.\n\nBODY POSITIVITY: FASHION SWAG + CONFIDENCE STRENGTH\n\nI love myself all my flaws to, because the woman I am covers up any flaws that may be seen as  abnormal to some, I see it differently. Confidence is when you fully embrace your body and self image, because a woman who loves who she is are unstoppable and motivated to make a impact.\nSelf love tags a long with bosy image, because when you love your body regardless of size or shape it\u2019s empowering in a way to embrace curves and stretch marks rocking it with strength \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffd. Having swag is easy, put together unique styles how you want to wear it and not allowing someone else\u2019s opinion to impact the way you style your look NEVER dress for someone else, dressing fly has to be about you and the way it makes you feel wearing it #ExpressYourself #TakeFashionRisks.\n\nEveryone deserves to feel sexy and happy, so I hope that you really love yourself more then you show when your infront of people and it will attract the right people to walk right into your life #BeAware #GlowUp. I diffinitely felt sexy and cute in this outfit, my high waisted jeans made me look visibly slimmer and my body suit paired so good it made me feel comfortable, confident fashionista alert \ud83d\udcaf.\nI was happy to get some new makeup, there will be some more makeup haul posts coming soon  within the next few weeks that I know your going to love \ud83d\udc40out for it and comment what eyeshadow  tutorial you would like to see me do next #ConfidenceIsStrength #ConfidenceIsEmpowering.\n\nI also seek to empower you to embrace who you are and giving self love, embracing yourself is impactful because your showing the world your confidence and strength. Which attracts some good people to want to know you and be close to you for sharing your own journey with them that inspired them to do something empowering in their life. Ghank you for reading today, I hope you continue to come back to see what I share next \ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udcaf please join me again for another post.

Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg \nIt's about to get a lot more interesting for the dollar and the euro, with both the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank scheduled to meet next week. Expectations are high that the Fed will raise interest rates for the third time this year, while the ECB will keep its main rate at zero, where it's been since early 2016. But that doesn't mean the dollar is poised to outperform as the euro lags behind. \nThe dollar has had a tough year, mostly weakening since the end of 2016 before briefly rebounding in September and October. Now, it's back under pressure as the reality of additional deficit spending as a condition sine qua non for tax cuts becomes evident. The technical trading picture doesn't look good for the dollar either, even if Fed policy is likely to be more aggressive in 2018 than it was in 2017. \nWe have been expecting the Fed to boost rates in December since July. Traders put the odds of a rate hike next week at almost 100 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And make no mistake -- with the near complete implementation of tax cuts, more Fed rate increases are coming. Next week, the U.S. central bank will also provide updated forecasts for economic growth and interest rates, and those are likely to reflect the potential for more aggressive policy action in 2018 and 2019 than was forecast in September. That is likely to give the dollar a jolt even if the Fed hikes rates by only 25 basis points, as expected. \nAs for the euro zone, the economy is on fire. The German Ifo index, which is a critical measure of business sentiment in the nation, continues to hit new record highs. Plus, the euro zone manufacturing PMI has been on a tear, expanding for 53 consecutive months through November 2017, when it hit its highest level since April 2000. \nWhile the dollar could strengthen on expectations of more U.S. economic growth and tighter monetary policy, the euro zone is approaching escape velocity. A surprise is coming from the ECB one of these months. If it doesn't come next week, the euro could come under pressure ahead of the Dec. 21 Catalan elections. That story hasn't fully played out, merely fading into the background. But don't be fooled by the reemergence of Catalan nationalism: Europe is the strongest it\u2019s been since the beginning of the new millennium -- and the ECB will ultimately tighten up policy. \nTrading patterns also convey a favorable outlook for the euro. Even after the passage of Senate tax legislation late last week, the greenback has remained below the critical 100-day moving average. In fact, the dollar is below most critical technical levels, with the last U.S. Dollar Index support at 92.6. This malaise in dollar trading technicals is in stark contrast to the euro, which has failed to close below $1.1607 based on CME's Globex electronic trading platform, a level which I referenced as critical in a recent Bloomberg Prophets commentary. \nIn the battle between the world's two most traded currencies, December could be a choppy month, but the euro is likely to emerge the winner in 2018.

Beyond just emotional tie-in, a color difference can make important elements pop in your imagery. Jeff Zych of Optimizely says to use bright colors that contrast from muted background to highlight the element you want visitors to focus on. HubSpot ran a test on two various call-to-action buttons. The red button outperformed the green button by 21%. Though you\u2019re limited on applying colors in ads, other than in image selection, remember this for your landing pages. What can help with making important aspects of an image pop is visual contrast. A high contrast image will stand out in the news feed. \nShow product in image. If your product looks good, you can help increase brand awareness and adjust expectations of what the landing page will be about. Although you should test imagery, as mentioned, you still want to stay true to your brand with ad design. All your ads speak the language of your company, and should use the same design guidelines as your website and print materials. Additionally, make sure imagery is high quality as it may be a user\u2019s first impression of your brand. Facebook ad design is at least 1200 x 628 pixels wide. Test and preview on multiple screens before your ad goes live. \nAs a recommendation for testing for either copy or imagery, also add any social proof within your text, images or video for that extra credibility boost. According to McKinsey, testimonials and word-of-mouth are driving about 20-50% of all purchasing decisions. An article in Econsultancy pointed out that when a website has customer reviews, 63% of visitors are more likely to buy something. WikiJob found that a page with a testimonials increase conversions by 34%. ConversionXL found out of 8 treatments (plus control), viewers were significantly more likely to remember high profile client logos, testimonials with photos, and press mentions. If you don\u2019t have testimonials, you\u2019ll want to prove your expertise in another way \u2014 perhaps, by promoting a Facebook post where you shared an original blog post. Start off with why someone should care about the post or ad they\u2019re seeing. Maybe it\u2019s because you have extensive years of experience in the topic you\u2019re about to talk about. Even though waiting can be beneficial, the more ads you have running, the lesser budget you have going to each \u2014 so make sure you review and pause/stop any campaigns that aren\u2019t performing as well as others on a weekly basis. This goes back to the first best practice of focusing on what\u2019s actually performing for your brand. \nTest ad types such as using video vs image ads, one image vs a carousel of them. Video ads have been shown to have overall better performance than image ads. After analyzing millions of videos, Wistia discovered that on average, people watch more than 80% of a video shorter than 30 seconds. But as the video length increases, engagement drops. According to Social Media Examiner , low video engagement may be due to including an intro, using logos or credit at beginning, trying to tell too much, or having a person talking to the camera without context. According to Facebook , captioned video ads increase video view time by an average of 12%. In mobile-feed environments, people like the option to have sound or not. If the video plays loudly and unexpectedly, 80% react negatively. Facebook video ads will be soundless by default. However, 41% of videos are basically meaningless without sound, which is where captions matter. According to Adobe , shopped that watch videos are 1.81 times more likely to purchase than non-video viewers. That\u2019s almost 85% increase in advertising ROI. However, Kinetic Social shows that video ads have the lowest eCPC, with an average eCPC of $0.18. Kinetic Social revealed that carousel ads are 10 times better at getting people to click compared to static sponsored posts on Facebook. Carousel ads are a great way to tell a story that can help people relate with your product and see themselves using it. According to Uri Hasson from Princeton, \u201cA story is the only way to activate parts in the brain, so that a listener turns the story into their own idea and experience.\u201d However, keep in mind that works for some may not work for your brand, so find your own performance pattern consistency to determine what works best for you. Reference the Setup section of this guide to learn more about different ad types. \nTest the placement of your ads such as a sponsored post that looks more native or organic to the platform. It might get better performance than a side ad for which users acknowledge is an ad right off the bat. If users don\u2019t normally engage on the side of the screen, it takes extra effort to do so. Adapt for how users engage with the platform you\u2019re advertising on. Don\u2019t rely on just running sponsored posts as people may consume and engage differently across devices, at different times of the day, and depending on several other factors. Here are some placement options: Desktop news feed. It\u2019s ideal for engagement, and generating direct sales or leads. You can include longer copy and contextualize CTAs. Desktop right column. This is a cheaper placement, but generally doesn\u2019t convert as well as the newsfeed \u2014 so it might be a choice for someone with a smaller budget or for targeting those who are already familiar with your brand, and thus more likely to click on a side ad. Mobile newsfeed. If you\u2019re looking for page likes to get exposure and build brand awareness, or promoting a mobile app, this option is best. You\u2019re constrained on copy length, so you\u2019ll need snappier headlines. Newsfeed placement works better for more complex products while the Audience Network and Instagram needs a smaller commitment from prospects. \nIf you do test placements, test max 2-3 ad placements at once, or otherwise you might end up with too small a sample size. The quicker you can test and determine what works for you, the better as an overview by AdEspresso on 2016 Q2 Facebook advertising costs showed that CPC in most placements has increased. \nTest the offers you provide such as offering something for free, that can be obtained immediately, or is of high value. If you get someone started with a lower request of getting a free trial version, he or she might be more willing to upgrade to the paid version after with a sense of already putting some investment of time or energy into utilizing. You\u2019re vying for people\u2019s attention in a space that has a lot of content to compete with, so get creative and keep your competitors\u2019 offers in mind. SurveyMonkey requested users to take surveys in return for a prize of a $300 PlayStation gift card. Offering an incentive in remarketing campaigns or ads with low commitment barrier can be just the budge a user needs. StackSocial had an offer to \u201cName your own price\u201d to try out the platform. If you\u2019re offering a paid product/service and you\u2019re new to a crowded market, if you have a good price point in comparison with competitors, it could be worth noting in your ad. Discounts or comparatively low priced items/services can be desirable offers. 98% of B2B website visitors don\u2019t convert nor sign up for any offers , but that could just come down to poor targeting and match of offer with audience. You have multiple audiences with different conversion intent and interest levels in your product/offer. Basically, take your audiences\u2019 temperatures and match CTAs to their intent and interest. Social media falls in between display and search when it comes to the intent & threat scale \u2014 but especially, if you\u2019re targeting Saved Audiences as opposed to more Custom Audiences, these users may have never heard of you before and be on the cooler end. Perhaps, try a free course or ebook, like Unbounce did in the Facebook ad image below. This way, you\u2019re still focusing on direct response conversions without coming in too hot. Unless in an arranged marriage, asking someone to marry you on a first meeting probably won\u2019t go over well, so don\u2019t ask for the sale from a cold audience who knows nothing about your brand. Work your way up to that ask. People are more likely to make a concession once they have rejected an initial offer as part of the principle of reciprocity, so there\u2019s still a way to get conversions from the initial non-converting traffic you bring in. This is where the power of retargeting comes in that we\u2019ll discuss in the next section. \nTest the targeting options so you\u2019re not wasting clicks on the wrong audience with the following suggestions: Target new personas. Perhaps, there\u2019s an audience you haven\u2019t tapped into yet that could be interested in your product/service. Make sure to constantly be reevaluating buyer personas to see if they\u2019ve changed or if there are additional personas that need to be developed. \nTarget fans. Even though Facebook doesn\u2019t offer you the ability to connect directly with fans\u2019 pages, you can advertise to them . By selecting \u201cPeople who like your Page and their friends,\u201d you\u2019re dwindling down to those with at least an initial interest in your brand, which makes advertising cheaper and more effective. In fact, when you target existing page fans with ads, you\u2019re expected to see 700% increase in click-throughs and they convert as much as 400% more often than non-fans. Keep in mind, a \u201cfan\u201d doesn\u2019t just have to be someone who engages with you only on Facebook; it could be someone who has shown interest in other ways like those who have engaged with your blog. Relying on continued engagement with your content through just organic push may not be the best strategy. According to a Social@Ogilvy analysis of more than 100 brand pages, the organic reach of Facebook posts was between 2-6% in February 2014. In 2016, Facebook announced making News Feed more friend- and family-centric, so organic reach tended to be lower. Luckily, you can create a Custom Audience from those who have read your blog (we\u2019ll go into re-targeting on more user behaviors in a bit here). When boosting a Facebook post to a cold audience, the cost-per-clicks were up to 120% higher compared to promoting a similar post to blog readers. If your blog covers several topics, you may have to create several custom audiences. \nTarget/retarget user behavior. You can target by user\u2019s previous behavior. In 2013, Facebook partnered with data brokers (e.g. Epsilon, Acxiom, and Datalogix), allowing brands to target by those who made recent purchases or engaged with a particular piece of content. If they\u2019re at a particular stage in the funnel, you can tailor retargeting ads more specific to their needs and readiness to buy. If they did make a purchase, you can increase lifetime value of the customer by upselling and inviting them back for additional purchases. For instance, if someone buys coffee beans, upsell with a kettle offer. This can be pretty meaningful as often returning customers have more value than new customers. According to Adobe , in the U.S., 41% of overall revenue comes from repeat customers. The average revenue per visit for repeat customers in the U.S. is 497% higher compared to regular shoppers. Also, according to eMarketer , nearly three out of five U.S. online buyers say they notice ads for products they\u2019ve previously looked up on other sites. One way to help get repeat customers, if you have a complex product, is to educate them after the fact such as with helpful guides. For example, Litmus put together a guide to email optimization and troubleshooting that helps users to succeed when using the new tool. You can pair Facebook ads with an email onboarding program to deliver guides when most needed, if you care about retention. It\u2019s really easy to retarget based on behavior as a cookie can be added for incoming visitors allowing ads to automatically be placed in front of them after they leave your website or bounce off your landing page. Remember, just because people may not be read to buy when initially seeing your ad, doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be ready in the future and you want your brand to be top of mind when they are ready. You can retarget users with an offer that\u2019s not much different from your core value proposition to remind them of your brand. Plotly\u2019s homepage reads: \u201cVisualize Data, Together\u201d and it continues explaining the data intelligence platform. Their Facebook ad repeats the same message in different words. You don\u2019t always have to get super granular either. By retargeting all website visitors, you can A/B test quickly to see what appeals to most of the potential buyers. Then, you can get more granular from there, if budget and time permits. Scoro targeted those who visited a Project Management landing page in last 60 days. Although the audience was only 2,000 people, it brought 12 leads in 20 days with a 70% lead conversion rate. Another example is with Intercom, a chat platform, retargeting marketers who had visited a landing page focused on email marketing. You can take it one step further by targeting not only those who have visited a particular page or blog article, but spent a particular amount of time on that page or article with \u201ctime on site\u201d retargeting . This can help determine someone\u2019s level of interest, like if the content they were reading was what they were looking for. Let\u2019s say they an audience has begun engaging with more than just your content, such as the product itself, but not in a way that has brought in revenue yet. Accordingly to Totango , you can only expect roughly 15-20% of you free trial users to actually become paying customers. Still, this presents a better opportunity for getting people to sign up for a paid version than targeting those with less higher an intent. You can share facts or stats about the product\u2019s benefits, use convincing messages to overcome objections, share case studies or guides on getting started, promote a free demo to go beyond just the free trial, or promote premium features that come with the paid version. By retargeting those who had free trials in past 6 months, by offering another free trial, you might be able to capture those who didn\u2019t have the money or interest to move forward initially, but are ready now. \nTarget life events. If your business caters to recognizable life events (e.g. weddings, birthdays, funerals), select the event you wish to target within your ad group \u2014 and capitalize on timely decisions that take place around these events (e.g. in early stages of planning when deciding what to buy for the event). \nTarget competitors\u2019 audiences. You can select up to 4 interests to target, including specific brands or businesses. Even though you can\u2019t advertise on your competitors\u2019 page, you could show up in the feed of their fans. Another thing to keep in mind with targeting by \u201cinterests\u201d is that it\u2019s vague, meaning that someone has shown an interest in the topic for whatever reason rather than meaning they for sure like it. Perhaps, someone is looking up basketballs, because they want to buy one for their nephew, but aren\u2019t a basketball fan his or her self. Now, he or she is getting hit with all these ads about \u201clove for basketball\u201d and is regretting even looking searching for it in the first place. \nRetarget non-open email subscribers. Really, you can target any list, whether based on behaviors or a list generated from another campaign and/or channel. You may already be retargeting newsletter subscribers or active engagers, but what about those who aren\u2019t opening or clicking on your emails? Email marketing usually outperforms social media marketing, but an average of 30-40% open rate is typical \u2014 so 60-70% aren\u2019t seeing your email content. It\u2019s not that people aren\u2019t interested (they signed up for your email list, after all), but perhaps they just get too much email or your email wound up in spam. MailChimp\u2019 s analysis of 60 million e-commerce purchases and 40 million email addresses from retailers showed that 1 inactive subscriber is worth 32% of all active subscribers. Even if your inactive email subscribers don\u2019t engage with your brand on a high scale, they\u2019re still 26% more likely to make a follow-up purchase than non-subscribers. Make a subscribers list of those who haven\u2019t opened the last three emails and upload as a Facebook custom audience for retargeting on Facebook. Perhaps, you\u2019ll also start to see a pattern of specific subscribers engaging with specific content. At the bare minimum, you can retarget based on activity levels. \nRetarget app users based on activity. Advertisers can target just those app users who haven\u2019t made a purchase, and new ads could revolve around upselling so users can increase speed of gameplay, for example. You\u2019ve done all the top-of-funnel retargeting, so this gets down to the bottom-of-the-funnel purchase conversions or even post-conversion retargeting. \nTarget \u201clookalike\u201d audiences. Now tying it all together, you can create similar audiences to any of the above. This helps you not only engage middle of funnel prospects and leads, but also keep your pipeline flowing with potential new audiences that may not be familiar with your brand. A good idea for a Lookalike Audience is those that \u201clook\u201d like past converters or purchasers. Essentially, you can broaden your audience beyond your custom audience. You can even choose percentage from 1%-10% for match rate to your current list. According to Facebook, an online travel site saw 70% lower cost per action when using Lookalike Audiences. Since they will be a fresh audience, remember to keep the threat low. \nThere was a huge difference between the most expensive and low-cost countries. When combined with differences in age, gender, interests, income and other layers, the results from targeting specific audiences vary tremendously. The targeting variations that have seen some of the biggest gains when revised have been: Country, Gender, Interests, and Age followed by Custom Audiences, Relationship Status, Purchase Behaviors, and Education Level. With so many choices for audience criteria and methods of targeting, make sure you run enough ads to get back valuable feedback from tests in a timely manner. There\u2019s a fine line between a smoke test meant to save you money and one that wastes money. There may be a number of elements that resonate or don\u2019t with your audience, so incorporate enough ad variations (5-10) to run for 2-3 weeks. Gather the results, refine and run again. Remember, you can always get better at targeting than you already may be. Also, remember that you paid for traffic\u2013so if only a small percentage convert, utilize retargeting campaigns and test out a secondary, more low friction offer. Keep these people in your pipeline whether it\u2019s with trying to get them to purchase a different product that\u2019s more relevant or just adding them to your email list to keep the communication going. Direct Facebook targeting will be to a cold visitor and you would more than likely start by using a Saved Audience, but Custom Audiences allow you to target warmer visitors. The average CTR of retargeting ads is 10x higher than that of regular display ads \u2014 so custom audiences are a great retargeting option to tap into. \nTest bidding methods. For instance, through advanced settings, you can manually set a CPC price in advance instead of letting Facebook bid on CPM for you. This can save you money in the long run and be more focused on your goal than abstract vanity impression count. If you\u2019re just starting out though, you don\u2019t want to jump the gun and automatic bidding is fine. \nTest number of ads & campaigns. Ad fatigue and audience decay (where message interest decreases over time) is higher on Facebook, so you need to have more variations. You\u2019re sometimes advertising to a more static audience rather than those who would be actively searching for what you offer like they would in Google Search Network. It\u2019s common to inaccurately attribute failure to one aspect of a campaign when not all aspects have been tested. Perhaps, for example, it\u2019s not that image ads perform worse than video ads, but that you selected a poor image for the ad. \nTest Timing/Rotation. The longer your ad runs, the more social proof it can accumulate with like and comments, which ads credibility and increases the effectiveness of the ad \u2014 so be patient and allow the ad to run for some time so you can milk it for all it\u2019s worth. While a general rule of thumb is to keep ad frequency below 3-5 points, you can sometimes exceed that by a little more with retargeting ads and still see good results. For instance, in the below, cost per click really only spiked closer to 15 points. \nOnce you\u2019ve determined your top performing campaigns for the week, you\u2019ll want to expand moderately . Costs per conversion don\u2019t always scale, so we recommend not scaling more than double each round. You don\u2019t have to do all the work yourself. Work smart, not hard by collaborating with other publishers (e.g. host a joint webinar). It may appear less promotional and more organic to viewers\u2013and as mentioned earlier, the native appearance can help performance. Analytics \nWhether you\u2019re beginning initial research, or have completed setup of your campaigns and followed best practices outlined above, dive into analytics \u2014 so you can strategize and continue to optimize for the best performance. Audience Insights \nFacebook has its own in-platform analytics called Audience Insights. Even though, this area is not specific to just ads, it can provide a lot of insight on your general audience and how they engage with your content. This way, if you choose to, say, promote a post, you at least have some baseline to start with when it comes to targeting. Remember, your audience off of Facebook may be different than your audience on Facebook. Here are some insights you can see: Age and gender of your audience Lifestyles of your audience (e.g. Mid Americana, Rural Parents, Established Elite, Spouses and Houses) Job titles of your audience Geographic location like top cities, countries and languages Household of your audience (e.g. income and size, home marketing value, home ownership, and spending habits) Activity reports and devices used Audience online spending habits and purchases Page likes to understand top categories correlated with audience preference \nGraph Search \nFacebook Graph Search can give you ideas about new audiences to further allow you to get more precise with interest targeting. If you want to explore the topic of pizza, you can type it into the search bar and find the following filters applied: Top ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hubspot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "econsultancy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uri hasson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mckinsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plotly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wistia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "optimizely", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scoro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unbounce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff zych", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "social media examiner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stacksocial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "acxiom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adobe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "direct facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "custom audiences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cpc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "datalogix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "audience insights  facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kinetic social", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intercom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google search network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "princeton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "totango", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:36.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "561080cdbc3fd1a60874224686d2cfad0957c0c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUUC4XTyMkceHuijXv4Nn97biCbtOasJOiUDr6Z4gXntgVg8s1vNOxHINziRTxFn9gO1uYbc0sv78vWu3u.ZNJjD7q83PN174MYBBtA9cA9sUBAtf4ImtqyrNa2zZhIgqA--", "site_full": "www.expedia.com", "site": "expedia.com", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com/West-Bend-Hotels.d180874.Travel-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Top 10 Hotels in West Bend, WI $51 | Hotel Deals on Expedia", "title": "Country Inn & Suites By Carlson West Bend:", "title_full": "Country Inn & Suites By Carlson West Bend: 2017 Room Prices, Deals & Reviews | Expedia", "published": "2017-08-04T02:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 416, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bd75243497105bbc59f6d354070b86aff32402a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUUC4XTyMkceHuijXv4Nn97biCbtOasJOiUDr6Z4gXntgVg8s1vNOxHINziRTxFn9gO1uYbc0sv78vWu3u.ZNJjD7q83PN174MYBBtA9cA9sUBAtf4ImtqyuHLbUA18_jtxoen12C9bNCMuRdUh0XSCBhhkA4L6s_w--", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-06T10:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "My husband and I booked this hotel on a whim.

According to cannabis research firm ArcView, legal weed sales in North America jumped by 34% in 2016, and they're expected to grow by 26% per year through 2021. We could be talking about a nearly $22 billion industry in just a few years' time if these projections prove accurate.\nThere's certainly good reason to believe we'll continue to see superior legal sales growth. Mexico legalized medical cannabis back in June, while Canada is in the midst of reviewing legislation that would make recreational weed legal as of July 1, 2018. These two factors alone could generate billions in additional annual sales. Within the U.S., more states appear ready to move forward with recreational legalization efforts in 2018.\nSome marijuana stock valuations are appalling\nIt's not often you find an industry with such steady high-growth potential, which is why marijuana stocks have been a popular choice among investors. Unfortunately, being a popular industry has caused pot valuations to soar into the stratosphere. A number of them simply don't make sense.\nFor instance, I've been hypercritical of Axim Biotechnologies' valuation in the past, and still remain strongly concerned for the sake of its shareholders. This cannabinoid-based drug maker has a pipeline that features more than a dozen proposed clinical trials, but we've witnessed only a handful moving forward into phase 1 studies. It would take a lot of capital to run 15 clinical studies, and according to its most recent quarterly report, the company had just $3.08 million in cash on hand. What's more, with $3.24 million in assets and $6.73 million in current liabilities (due within 12 months), it may not have the funding to keep the lights on. Despite this, its share price is up over 1,500% over the past two years.\nI'm also not a huge fan of Aurora Cannabis following a more than 150% move higher in just a one-month time frame. Though the Canadian-based medical cannabis grower is on track and on budget with its pivotal Aurora Sky project, which will generate 100,000 kilograms of low-cost dried cannabis annually when complete in mid-2018, it's only recently pushed into the black. What's more, the company has been diluting the daylights out of its shareholders, with its outstanding share count exploding higher by more than 2,200% since mid-2014. Even though bought-deal financing and convertible debentures are a source of easy capital for the company, it's going to catch up with shareholders at some point.\nThis might be the only undervalued marijuana stock\nHowever, one pot stock might actually be undervalued, even taking into account the fact that it's doubled since the end of July. Ladies, gentlemen, and marijuana-stock investors, say hello to Canada's MedReleaf.\nIf the name isn't all that familiar, it's because the company only went public earlier this year. It's a medical cannabis play in Canada that, like Aurora, is itching for Canada's parliament to legalize recreational marijuana. Among the big four companies in our neighbor to the north, MedReleaf has an opportunity to garner perhaps 10% of both the medical and recreational market share (assuming approval).\nWhat's been really notable about MedReleaf, with the exception of its most recent quarter, is that it's been significantly more profitable than its peers. This is a result of the company focusing its efforts on a more affluent medical clientele in Canada. It offers a more expansive array of cannabis strain prices, and has really pushed into cannabis oils and extracts as a source of sales growth. Cannabis oils and extracts have considerably higher price points relative to dried cannabis, meaning they also lead to better margins (MedReleaf controlled 44.5% of the Canadian cannabis oils market share as of the end of 2016). This means MedReleaf doesn't have to work nearly as hard as its peers to generate the same amount of profit.\nThe company also ended its most recent quarter with about $58 million in cash and cash equivalents. Though that's dwarfed by the more than $268 million Aurora Cannabis has in its coffers, MedReleaf has been much more responsible about its capital raises. Rather than diluting its shareholders, MedReleaf has been living off the capital raised from its initial public offering. This doesn't mean it won't seek a bought-deal offering like its peers in the future, but it does suggest that management may have a better focus on its shareholders than its peers.\nWith MedReleaf having a genuine opportunity to lead the industry with the highest operating margin, it could easily be undervalued if Canada moves forward with adult-use legalization and it secures about 10% of the medical and recreational market.\n The Most Undervalued Marijuana Stock Is... -- The Motley Fool\nAuthor: Sean Williams\nContact: Contact Customer Service\nPhoto Credit: Getty Images\nWebsite: Fool.com: Stock Investing Advice | Stock Research", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/12/06/the-most-undervalued-marijuana-stock-is.aspx", "https://www.fool.com/contact/customer-service/", "https://www.fool.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:37.001+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6511aa27e48de3b91ed7a7b2a3a388a7f09ab1cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg999YYspK0ijSseSh6BN._3..Pn5xxIlZXyfcaAHgWizaIRTRPvUIaOflHWBLMYDpKJ3kr2h0LF9crA5euuK7ydzYAcQ_yPk22QXYza85.n0w--", "site_full": "www.poandpo.com", "site": "poandpo.com", "site_section": "http://poandpo.com/rss-articles/", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "POST Online Media", "title": "Lululemon athletica Q3 diluted EPS $0.43", "title_full": "Lululemon athletica Q3 diluted EPS $0.43", "published": "2017-12-07T07:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "HR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6511aa27e48de3b91ed7a7b2a3a388a7f09ab1cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg999YYspK0ijSseSh6BN._3..Pn5xxIlZXyfcaAHgWizaIRTRPvUIaOflHWBLMYDpKJ3kr2h0LF9crA5euuK7ydzYAcQ_yPk22QXYza85.n0w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T07:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Lululemon athletica Q3 diluted EPS $0.43", "text": "Lululemon athletica Net revenue was $619 million Lululemon athletica Q3 diluted EPS $0.43 Staff Writer | Thursday December 7, 2017 | 13 minutes ago Lululemon athletica announced financial results for the third quarter ended October 29, 2017.

Cutting down a Christmas tree is a yearly tradition our whole family looks forward to. And while it's usually cold and snowy - this year was a different story! Sunny and high 40s was a welcome change to freezing our buns off and taking the first tree we found... instead, my kids had a blast running through the acres and acres of trees and my husband and I got to slowly peruse the selection without having to snatch and grab one because we were so cold. Of course, we still had to snag a warm beverage for the drive out there - I mean, a tradition is a tradition. A cozy fleece pullover , hat (40% off!) and scarf (under $25!) were perfect for battling the slight chill in the air and I was afraid the farm would be muddy so I went for my SOREL boots ... which are a work horse for keeping your feet dry, warm and the mud washes off them so easily. These trees here in the photos are my favorite trees of all, they are called Concolor. You can see they are quite fluffy and have a blueish/greenish color. If you smell them they have a citrusy-pine scent. Which is AMAZING. Unfortunately their branches don't hold ornaments too well, especially the heavy ornaments. We ended up with a very full and TALL Balsam Fir (9 feet - yikes!), which has very soft needles and strong branches. Firs have what I would call a very woodsy-pine scent.

Department of Justice officials told Fox News they are in the process of going through the texts so they can hand them over to the House Intelligence Committee. Strzok, who was an FBI counterintelligence agent, had worked on the Mueller probe, but was reassigned to the FBI\u2019s human resources division after the discovery of anti-Trump text messages with Page, with whom he was having an affair.

I have had it for a while but not used it because it tends to bind in the cut. I have another vintage 10\" x 14TPI saw, open handle pistol grip that cuts well but has no maker identification I can see, it would also benefit from a touch up, but I wouldn't try and change its geometry.\nThe teeth on the Disston are definitely not sharp and presumably not enough set. I'll sharpen first to see if that fixes the cut before trying to enhance the set, however that will be another challenge since my saw set only dials down to 12TPI.\nVeritas say their 20TPI is intended for 1/2\" and under, which would cover drawer sides I think. I reckon 20TPI would feel just like scratching at the cut. Rather than the Cosman progressive TPI filing I think I might try a progressive change of rake as Paul Sellers suggests.\nAgreed, filing 14TPI is going to be enough challenge for my eyes, not to mention I don't think I have a file suitable for 20TPI.\nCheers, Franklin", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://d1r5wj36adg1sk.cloudfront.net/images/smilies/smile.gif", "http://d1r5wj36adg1sk.cloudfront.net/images/icons/icon1.png"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:37.026+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1caf88765707c15ca97f6edecb47eca94c55b41d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg89XGkb7wsnqDxs.J4m7vkF8UxV9jkxBlI76edymJUennrlY4i17BPmwu_EhY4KE2_xaKGw43ksi.brva_gnn8K", "site_full": "www.woodworkforums.com", "site": "woodworkforums.com", "site_section": "http://www.woodworkforums.com/f151", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "scuba_diving", "sports", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting"], "section_title": "HAND TOOLS &amp; MACHINERY", "title": "Dovetail saw TPI", "title_full": "Dovetail saw TPI", "published": "2017-12-04T11:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3d036184265b0d627f882a71aa66e5eb3dc3877c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg89XGkb7wsnqDxs.J4m7vkF8UxV9jkxBlI76edymJUennrlY4i17BPmwu_EhY4KE2_xaKGw43ksixCWHz4nIX.NVlROZtN4J7UCA7oYk9IHKA--", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "derekcohen", "published": "2017-12-05T01:40:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "While the teeth very likely need to be sharpened, binding is usually caused by too little set.\nRegards from Perth\nDerek Visit www.inthewoodshop.com for tutorials on constructing handtools, handtool reviews, and my trials and tribulations with furniture builds.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://d1r5wj36adg1sk.cloudfront.net/images/icons/icon1.png"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:37.031+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1caf88765707c15ca97f6edecb47eca94c55b41d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg89XGkb7wsnqDxs.J4m7vkF8UxV9jkxBlI76edymJUennrlY4i17BPmwu_EhY4KE2_xaKGw43ksi.brva_gnn8K", "site_full": "www.woodworkforums.com", "site": "woodworkforums.com", "site_section": "http://www.woodworkforums.com/f151", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "scuba_diving", "sports", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting"], "section_title": "HAND TOOLS &amp; MACHINERY", "title": "Dovetail saw TPI", "title_full": "Dovetail saw TPI", "published": "2017-12-04T11:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2bf736af97c77f3298571328ec0fcd27bad1784a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg89XGkb7wsnqDxs.J4m7vkF8UxV9jkxBlI76edymJUennrlY4i17BPmwu_EhY4KE2_xaKGw43ksixCWHz4nIX.NVlROZtN4J7VIbT6P4OGdtQ--", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Luke Maddux", "published": "2017-12-05T03:20:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I, for one, consider 20tpi to be a \"specialty\" pitch on a backsaw.\nI had a Veritas 20tpi saw and I got rid of it. It's not a pitch that I care for in my personal work. I found that I experienced binding with it right out of the box.\nPerhaps my sawing skills have improved since then, and it was user error. I'm sure Lee Valley would not sell a saw which bound in cuts just by virtue of its factory setup. Nonetheless, the physics are certainly there to explain why it would be more likely to bind. Smaller tooth = shorter tooth = less possible set = smaller kerf to plate thickness ratio.\nIt's also damn hard to sharpen 20tpi. Hell, it's hard to even see it, and I'm in my early 30's.\nI also found it very slow.\nI eventually switched to a 15tpi saw, which, I think, is the pitch which Lie Nielsen includes on their dovetail saw (although mine isn't a LN). I think this is a more traditional pitch, and I find it cuts very quickly (3-5 strokes per dovetail cut typically), and is easy (or at least easier) to sharpen and set. I don't think I've ever had it bind on me either.\nThat's just been my personal experience. If I was making a lot of teensy boxes in 3-6mm thick stock, then I may be singing a different tune. I have a tiny, 5-6\" dovetail saw and I'm actually not certain of its pitch. I THINK it's 18tpi. I use that one for thin stock joinery, which I cut very rarely.\nI guess my final thought would be that if it's an extra saw, and you think you may need to cut tails in thin stock soon, then have at it at 20tpi, but if it's just a general use saw, then I'd consider a more coarse pitch.\nMy US$0.02.\nCheers,\nLuke", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://d1r5wj36adg1sk.cloudfront.net/images/icons/icon1.png"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:37.032+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f057250bfe023be50e36959f4344abee48b15a23", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.l.zCG8cNGcvWaGWIk2mtuHgpRIUjH4dm6t.7u8RalepE5BEmM1wM_X8.RJFTRIH7DehFf7gn34SU98kKgFgR0fFU8p8AA2Jk-", "site_full": "www.helpbiotech.co.in", "site": "helpbiotech.co.in", "site_section": "http://www.helpbiotech.co.in/", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "helpBIOTECH", "title": "OU Cancer Molecular Mechanism Project Vacancy", "title_full": "OU Cancer Molecular Mechanism Project Vacancy", "published": "2017-12-07T12:17:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f057250bfe023be50e36959f4344abee48b15a23", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.l.zCG8cNGcvWaGWIk2mtuHgpRIUjH4dm6t.7u8RalepE5BEmM1wM_X8.RJFTRIH7DehFf7gn34SU98kKgFgR0fFU8p8AA2Jk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply@blogger.com (helpBIOTECH Team)", "published": "2017-12-07T12:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "OU Cancer Molecular Mechanism Project Vacancy", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:17:37.035+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1caf88765707c15ca97f6edecb47eca94c55b41d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg89XGkb7wsnqDxs.J4m7vkF8UxV9jkxBlI76edymJUennrlY4i17BPmwu_EhY4KE2_xaKGw43ksi.brva_gnn8K", "site_full": "www.woodworkforums.com", "site": "woodworkforums.com", "site_section": "http://www.woodworkforums.com/f151", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "scuba_diving", "sports", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "painting"], "section_title": "HAND TOOLS &amp; MACHINERY", "title": "Dovetail saw TPI", "title_full": "Dovetail saw TPI", "published": "2017-12-04T11:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fd04a7217471d1558abb0c71607f5fcd35e9f8e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg89XGkb7wsnqDxs.J4m7vkF8UxV9jkxBlI76edymJUennrlY4i17BPmwu_EhY4KE2_xaKGw43ksixCWHz4nIX.NVlROZtN4J7VZJEpqkBCjBw--", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Fuzzie", "published": "2017-12-05T05:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Well I sharpened it this morning with the progressive rake tooth shape (14TPI), first inch 30, 2nd inch more aggressive and the body of the saw zero.

I note starting the saw on the effectively much thicker double board was a bit different. The attack angle on the board made a big difference to starting the cut. The negative rake at the tip made it feel more difficult to start a flat cut straight across the boards, the cut started best at an angle on the edge, moving to horizontal once reaching the aggressive rake teeth.\nI'm thinking the progressive change doesn't need to be so long, perhaps just the 1st inch at a medium rake would be OK.

The only things left to determine are seeding battles in week 14 and of course, who actually wins the Shelby trophy and who loses the battle for the MoonBak, a trophy that I do not believe exists at this moment (we need to work on that). Nobody knows quite how the first round of the WRBL playoffs will look but, we now know with absolute certainty that the four participating players will be Andy Todd, Nick Zurawski, Scott Aschebrook and Ryan Dougherty. How did we get here? Well, Ryan has been the least dominant superteam ever as his 12-1 hypothetical record has only translated to an 8-5 reality record, with the randomized league scheduling working against his favor. Interestingly enough, the league's highest-scoring team was also the last team to clinch a playoff spot with a 125-116 win over Scott Bless Scott Damn. Ben Roethlisberger's slow Monday night start restrained him to a nice 17 points for Scott and tripling down against the 0-12 Browns worked out as Ryan's one last strategy to clinch a playoff spot. Ryan used Keenan Allen's 26 points, Hunter Henry's 15 and the LA defense's 12 to contribute 42% of his lineup's scoring. The scariest player entering the postseason is never the league's top scorer or a player coming back fresh from an injury or suspension, it's the player that gets the hottest at the exact right moment and Keenan Allen is somehow the first player in NFL HISTORY to have three consecutive games of 10+ catches, 100+ yards and at least 1 touchdown. It's amazing Antonio Brown, Randy Moss, Jerry Rice or even Torry Holt had not done that yet. \n\nEverybody seems to be rooting for Nick Zurawski and rightfully so, as he is the man willing to be the commissioner of this fine league every year and would probably get the coolest possible photos of The Shelby trophy on the road. The odds are somewhat in his favor as well with the league's top two wide receivers in a PPR-scoring league plus, Jimmy Graham is suddenly the NFL's best red zone target. Personally, I'm rooting for Scott because his team is in a downward spiral and it would make just about as much sense as #4 seed Cole winning it all last year. What can I say? I'm a sucker for a Cinderella story. Of course, when the difference between #1 and #4 is one game, there are no Cinderellas and Scott is just that dude that always steals your players at the draft out of spite. While it would be cool to win two out of three years (three out of five if we're including the pre-Blog, even less official than the semi-official season WRBL), I'm totally understanding that there's a time for each individual WRBL owner to bathe in the glorious sunlight that bursts through the clouds unto them immediately after the WRBL championship and I already enjoyed that elation. Coming into the season, I was furious and ready to destroy you all but, most of that was misplaced erratic behavior caused by a train. After all, I'm winning my family's Yahoo! fantasy league (#notsohumblebrag) and my focus has entirely shifted to my 38-year dynasty, TD-only league where my dad and I have two(!!!) ties and there are six teams above .500. Much like Aaron Rodgers needs a second ring before Ben Roethlisberger somehow gets a third (because that makes more sense), I need to win the TD-only league for the first time in 13 years before I win this one for the first time in 2.  \n\nNBCSports \nNot only has Jimmy Graham led Nick to a 6-game winning streak but, he has helped Todd's Tornados lead the PFL in scoring this season. What a swell fella. \nThe only NFL game that really stirred the pot of controversy in both the NFL and fantasy was Monday night's Steeler-Bengal DEATHFEST 2017. Everybody and their mother was suspended as a result of dirty plays, concussions, spinal injuries and I'm pretty sure Brick killed a guy. Every WRBL result was in play besides Sneen's woeful showing costing him a 40-point loss. As I already mentioned, a 27-point performance would have given Big Ben enough points to lead Scott to an epic comeback win over Ryan and would have kept Alec's postseason hopes alive but, it took the 14-year QB until the fourth quarter to really pick up his pace and it was too little, too late. Alec ended Darrin's surprising three-game win streak with Le'Veon Bell racking up an incredibly clutch 28 points (and Hero of the Week honors) along with the Steelers defense's 1 point for a 10-point, Monday Night victory. The best match-up of the week was Antonio Brown and Chris Boswell versus A.J. Green as Nick trailed Cole by 3 points and despite Green scoring two touchdowns before the Steelers rallied for their own comeback win, Nick rallied his own team to a six-point victory as the Cincinnati rain contributed to take away at least 5 A.J. Green points via drops and the league's leading scorer (Brown) did Antonio Brown things, like hanging onto a pass despite George Iloka wanting to decapitate him on the field, just like old Johnny \"No Head\" Burton, the former Canton Bulldog who played five games in 1922 without a skull. They really don't make football players like they used to.  \n\nWeek 14 doesn't mean a damn thing other than bragging rights for locking up the #1 seed in the WRBL playoffs and if I beat Darrin, then I have those rights for a couple of days. It would help if Kareem Hunt could resurrect his now irrelevant career but it could be worse, he could be convincing himself to start Jason Witten for another 1-point week (of which he has three for Darrin). Technically, any of the four playoff teams could snatch the top spot in the playoffs and with Scott facing Sneen, Alec versus Nick and Ryan trying to hold off Cole despite ALLEGATIONS! (we really don't know what Cole is talking about when he says \"Ryan is winning despite ALLEGATIONS\" but, we'd really love to know what further ALLEGATIONS come out after Ryan beats him), it's even possible that all four teams win and hold the exact same seeding headed into week 15. It's bound to be a weird and wild week and hopefully, not a single player is injured because it would be pretty shitty for a starter on playoff team to go down in a week that is mostly irrelevant to both us winners and losers. Shout out to Clemson, Oklahoma, Georgia and Alabama on making the College Football Playoff and shout out to Ben McAdoo on getting Eli Manning his starting job back by getting himself fired.  \n\n\nScoring Leaders QB Russell Wilson 268 (SWANSON) Tom Brady 232 (SNEEN) Dak Prescott 192  (TODD)  Drew Brees 121 (DOUGHERTY) Cam Newton 109 (ASCHEBROOK SR.)

doesn\u2019t believe he represents the country well. \"I want to represent our country well. I don't think that there are a lot of people currently in our government that do that,\" Vonn told CNN. She added that she hopes \"to represent the people of the United States, not the president\" at the upcoming Winter Olympics. The skier also said she would not accept an invitation to the White House if she won another gold medal at next year\u2019s Winter Olympics. Oh, my God!

Parlamentul European si Consiliul sunt invitate sa adopte aceasta propunere pana la jumatatea anului 2019. Astfel, la nivel global va actiona in continuare Fondului Monetar International, dar Fondul Monetar European va fi acela care va proteja Europa in fata unei noi crize. Bancile in dificultate vor putea apela la FME Noul Fond va avea ca responsabilitate, de asemenea, sprijinirea statelor membre din zona euro in situatii de dificultate financiara. In plus, acesta va acorda sprijin si Fondului unic de rezolutie si va actiona in calitate de creditor de ultima instanta in cazul bancilor in dificultate, protejand astfel platitorii de taxe.De asemenea, institutia va putea adopta decizii rapide in caz de urgenta, cu 85% din voturi, iar unanimitatea voturilor va fi pastrata pentru deciziile cu impact financiar major. In plus, Fondul se va putea implica mai direct in gestionarea programelor de asistenta financiara, impreuna cu Comisia Europeana. Totodata, in viitor, FME va avea posibilitatea sa dezvolte noi instrumente financiare, ce ar putea fi utilizate ca functii de stabilizare. \"Transformand MES-ul intr-un organ comunitar, il facem mai responsabil in fata Parlamentului European, fara a slabi parlamentele nationale, si facilitam de asemenea legaturile cu Comisia\", a declarat comisarul european pentru Afaceri Economice, Pierre Moscovici. Fondul va ajuta si statele care vor sa adere la euro La randul sau, vicepresedintele Comisiei Europene, Valdis Dombrovskis, a explicat faptul ca acest instrument financiar european va putea fi un sprijin real - de asistenta tehnica si financiara - pentru statele membre care fac eforturi de aderare la zona euro. \u201cNu vedem nicio criza la orizont, dar este bine sa repari acoperisul cand e soare afara\u201d, a precizat Dombrovskis. Potrivit acestuia, datele macroeconomice arata bine in prezent, dar \u201ctrebuie sa ne gandim si la slabiciunile pe care le avem\". Ideea unui Fond Monetar European, avansata deja in repetate randuri in trecut, se bucura de sprijinul marilor capitale europene. Insa propunerea Comisiei ar putea sa se loveasca de viziunea Germaniei cu privire la arhitectura unei astfel de institutii, scrie presa internationala. De asemenea, Comisia a publicat miercuri o comunicare (un aviz fara valoare juridica destinat orientarii dezbaterilor-n.r.) cu privire la noi instrumente bugetare cu care ar putea fi dotata zona euro. In acest sens, Comisia are in vedere infiintarea unei linii bugetare cu mai multe functii: stabilizarea zonei euro in caz de soc economic, mecanism de convergenta specific pentru statele membre care se pregatesc sa adere la zona euro si sprijin acordat statelor membre pentru reforme structurale printr-un instrument de realizare a reformelor.

Commissioned in the aftermath of the Germanwings tragedy, Aviation and aerospace psychology has been written by a group of expert psychologists chaired by Professor Robert Bor and draws on clinical experience and the latest research. Aviation personnel, says the paper, work in a unique environment and endure a range of stressors that may place them at increased risk of developing mental health issues. The incidence of mental health conditions in aviation workers is difficult to determine as pilots are reluctant to disclose problems for fear of losing their licence to fly. Regulatory body records suggest mental health conditions are second only to cardiovascular disease as a reason for loss of licence, so the application of psychology and use of qualified psychologists should be an integral part of the aviation industry's investment in the wellbeing of their staff. Aviation and aerospace psychology says airlines should bring in policies for the psychological upskilling of the wider aviation workforce to promote its optimum wellbeing. They should insist on high-quality psychological assessment throughout a pilot's career, while pilots should be encouraged to understand their own mental health. Professor Robert Bor says: \"Commercial airline pilots are responsible for the safe carriage of thousands of people every day and the demand for air travel is predicted to double over the next 20 years. \"The aviation industry must invest in the wellbeing of their workforce to meet this demand and ensure safety is not compromised. It is very important that the application of psychology and the use of qualified psychologists is an integral part of that investment. \"The prevention and identification of mental health conditions before they lead to a crisis can be achieved if airlines implement high quality psychological monitoring and support and, where needed, assessment by qualified practitioners.\" \nEarlier this week Professor Bor was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society.
