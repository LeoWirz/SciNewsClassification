The Charlotte Observer via AP Diedra Laird Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio speaks at a news conference at the Government Center about the hacking of Mecklenburg County's servers in Charlotte, N.C., Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. A $25,000 ransom in bit coin was being sought for the files being held. County officials said late this afternoon they are not paying the ransom. The Charlotte Observer via AP Diedra Laird North Carolina county's ransomware recovery will take days By JONATHAN DREW Associated Press December 07, 2017 04:06 AM UPDATED 3 HOURS 33 MINUTES AGO \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" Never miss a local story. Sign up today for unlimited digital access to our website, apps, the digital newspaper and more. SUBSCRIBE NOW \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common \u2014 and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dena diorio", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jonathan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irwin carmichael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith gregg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ross rustici", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anjanette flowers grube", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mobile & apps mecklenburg county", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "government center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cybereason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county sheriff's office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap diedra laird north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap diedra laird mecklenburg county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte observer", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mecklenburg county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.c.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:19.087+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51da9243cd3cefc4c4cce57e92301a31bfaf944e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCb3LzENt.DbjCDoihQ8x8jSiIe877uIVu26D3EXI5gc1.5Nydr6SX4UrtO4uyC6NBRDqzCAU.IQSJD9Hu8RFGSbDj8tDsFF56MXvJjCI3vQ--", "site_full": "rollonfriday.com", "site": "rollonfriday.com", "site_section": "http://rollonfriday.com/Discussion/MainDiscussion/tabid/381/Default.aspx", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "legal_issues"], "section_title": "RollOnFriday &gt; Main Discussion ", "title": "What is it Sleeps calls it?

He would long have been stoned to death if he were to live today in any Muslim country! In reality, Babur was a disgrace in name of Islam. To know Babur better, let us not depend on claims of Hindu \u2018fundamentalists\u2019 or biased \u2018right-winged\u2019 historians. Let us instead hear from the horse\u2019s mouth. Let us review the autobiography of Babur \u2013 Baburnama \u2013 which is available in all prominent languages. For purpose of this article, we shall refer to the English translation by Annette Susannah Beveridge published in 1922. This translation was done directly from whatever portions of original Turkish manuscript were available. These suffice to establish the true character of Babur. You can download a scanned copy from http://www.archive.org/details/baburnama017152mbp Babur \u2013 the homosexual drunkard child molester The autobiography clearly establishes Babur as a compulsive homosexual child molester. So those defending Babri Masjid should first clearly explain if Islam justifies homosexuality and child-molestation. If not, Babur was a disgrace in name of Islam and hence any structure constructed by him is also a disgrace in name of Islam. 1. In Page 120-121 of the biography he says that he was not much interested in his wife but was maddened by a boy named Babri . He confesses that he had not loved anyone like he was mad for this boy. He used to compose verses in love of the boy. For example: \u201cThere has been no lover except me who is so sad, passionate and insulted. And there is no one more cruel and wretched than my lover!\u201d 2. He says that Babri used to come \u2018close\u2019 to him and that used to make Babur so excited that he could not even utter a word. Because of being intoxicated, he could not even thank Babri for his show of love. This post is part of following Agniveer book.

The Joint Committee is consulting all the stakeholders on the provisions of the FRDI Bill. Certain misgivings have been expressed in the media regarding \u201cbail-in\u201d provisions of the FRDI Bill. The provisions contained in the FRDI Bill, as introduced in the Parliament, do not modify present protections to the depositors adversely at all. They provide additional protections to the depositors in a more transparent manner.  Presently, each depositor of banks can be only protected up to a limit of Rs. 1 lakh by the guarantee of the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC). Remaining deposits (i.e. beyond Rs. 1 lakh of deposits in a bank) do not have any deposit protection guarantee and are treated, at par with claims of unsecured creditors as of now. Besides providing similar protection / guarantee of Rs. 1 lakh to depositors, as it exists today, the rights of uninsured depositors are being placed at an elevated status in the FRDI Bill compared to the existing legal arrangements over the unsecured creditors and even Government dues.  The FRDI Bill is far more depositor friendly than many other jurisdictions, which provide for statutory bail-in, where consent of creditors / depositors is not required for bail-in.  The FRDI Bill does not propose in any way to limit the scope of powers for the Government to extend financing and resolution support to banks, including public sector banks. Government\u2019s implicit guarantee for public sector banks remains unaffected.  Indian Banks have adequate capital and are also under prudent regulation and supervision to ensure safety and soundness, as well as systemic stability. The existing laws ensure the integrity, security and safety of the banking system. In India, all possible steps and policy measures are taken to prevent the failure of banks and protection of interests of depositors (e.g. issue of directions / prompt corrective action measures, capital adequacy and prudential norms). The FRDI Bill will strengthen the system by adding a comprehensive resolution regime that will help ensure that, in the rare event of failure of a financial service provider, there is a system of quick, orderly and efficient resolution in favour of depositors.  \n\nCourtesy: pib.nic.in ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "financial resolution and deposit insurance bill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joint committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deposit insurance and credit guarantee corporation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:21.019+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "48f6578f09df4dba26c7843626ad78290214c90b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHMCh4uHYUGua.AKapYfzpkioQDNFrl1u5IfI12zoN7HfWXzFlFeQcq3VcFv37M1flPBUz3qh_YZOgZ60iinhUuxgOce2PznEZvpIsv1CoojNZwBrMBWPQNy_S3gCaNAYsaBK5gUI1isnHHpxsXQT0tNI-", "site_full": "www.ebay.com", "site": "ebay.com", "site_section": "https://www.ebay.com/sch/With-2-Way-Paging/169329/i.html?_fsrp=1%3F_fsrp%3D1", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Car Remote Start &amp; Alarm Combos (with 2-Way Paging) | eBay", "title": "Audiovox-Flashlogic-FLRSCH4-Chrysler-Data-Start-Module", "title_full": "Reviews: Audiovox-Flashlogic-FLRSCH4-Chrysler-Data-Start-Module | eBay", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "48f6578f09df4dba26c7843626ad78290214c90b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKwsVX83iHMCh4uHYUGua.AKapYfzpkioQDNFrl1u5IfI12zoN7HfWXzFlFeQcq3VcFv37M1flPBUz3qh_YZOgZ60iinhUuxgOce2PznEZvpIsv1CoojNZwBrMBWPQNy_S3gCaNAYsaBK5gUI1isnHHpxsXQT0tNI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "aly6829.eafuqmgqh", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "The best", "text": "At first I was watching the instructions on you tube video and it was so easy, so l order the piece, and now I order another one for me Dodge Durango , so it's will be helpful if they can make more v", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:21.021+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3ab57c3867fc9823c1f3d0bf7da493faa285a370", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8gtrG_INPyGttYsP.yCSf1XHVXhYXefTokEoI9Fo92Mo74gtRfwbPG4pxR3PBHJR.Efr55XYcJAA--", "site_full": "www.detailingworld.co.uk", "site": "detailingworld.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.detailingworld.co.uk/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=138", "site_categories": ["tennis", "sports"], "section_title": "Manufacturers and Private Label Brands -

Oil and gas are generated as the sediments are buried and the temperature rises. Oil is the first hydrocarbon to be generated, followed by wet gas, and lastly by dry gas. Once generated, oil and gas flow vertically and laterally through overlying sediments because of the density difference between hydrocarbons and formation water and they migrate through permeable formations until they encounter a reservoir trap in which oil and gas accumulate. Oil will fill the traps first because it is first to be generated. Higher temperatures resulting from continued burial cause gas to be generated. Migrating gas will displace oil from the traps because gas has a lower density. The displaced oil will migrate further updip and fill any trap encountered\nhttp://petrowiki.org/Reservoir_geology", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://petrowiki.org/Reservoir_geology"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:21.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3ab57c3867fc9823c1f3d0bf7da493faa285a370", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8gtrG_INPyGttYsP.yCSf1XHVXhYXefTokEoI9Fo92Mo74gtRfwbPG4pxR3PBHJR.Efr55XYcJAA--", "site_full": "www.detailingworld.co.uk", "site": "detailingworld.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.detailingworld.co.uk/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=138", "site_categories": ["tennis", "sports"], "section_title": "Manufacturers and Private Label Brands - Detailing World", "title": "Auto-Foam", "title_full": "Auto-Foam - Detailing World", "published": "2017-12-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 77279, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be546e629151fd2cffcb4ed344d1c397903888bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8gtrG_INPyGttYsP.yCSf1XHVXhYXefTokEoI9Fo92Mo74gtRfwbPG4pxR3PBHJR_.cl23PYhULD54tWPGjFRA", "ord_in_thread": 3, "author": "James_R", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Quote: : (Post 5410449) Please don't give generic measurements for people using autofoam - the amount needed varies massively depending on the pressure washer used as well as the foam lance on top of the lance's setting.\nIt's best to use the DW autofoam review thread for the quick and easy method to set your own amount for your own equipment.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:21.033+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9712bc46342c0311730fe1141e0ac28728bfccbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9D2Qkpp6vWSMwMM8NxS2qQ4nMVF4sMvv9Bob7v5bEBIiZGAzw.Y2i2CMuZXRehESoNl2PIvjK7DzGLQUkTegG_vjjBnngaJUB7ULG1PT0J.g_ijR4nFi7V", "site_full": "www.lse.co.uk", "site": "lse.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.lse.co.uk/share-chat.asp?page=212", "site_categories": ["united_kingdom", "travel", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Share Chat on London South East.

It is expected that the total market size for the region will expand to 517 million passengers within 20 years.\nSITA will be showcasing how biometrics, artificial intelligence, mixed reality and robotics will help shape the future of travel technology in the Middle East and meet the challenge of growing passenger numbers.\nThese innovations include KATE, an intelligent check-in kiosk that will autonomously move to busy or congested areas in the airport as needed, promising to relegate check-in queues to the past. Using various data sources \u2013 including flight and passenger flow information \u2013 KATE can identify where additional check-in kiosks are required to reduce passenger queue times at check-in.\nBiometrics is widely seen as holding the key to a truly walkthrough experience at the airport and SITA will demonstrate how its Smart PathTM uses biometrics as the single identification token at every step in the passenger journey. It is easily integrated into existing airport infrastructure and airline systems, such as check-in kiosks, bag drop units, gates for secure access, boarding and automated border control. Smart PathTM is already in use at Brisbane Airport.\nSITA will also demonstrate how HoloLens, the world\u2019s first self-contained holographic computer, can be used to visualize and interact with the airport\u2019s operational data including aircraft movement, passenger movement and retail analytics.\nSelf-service has also shown the way in streamlining passenger processing at the airport and SITA\u2019s Scan&Fly\u2019s plug-and-play design allows the bag-drop solution to be easily installed onto existing airport check-in desks, maximizing terminal space while leveraging the speed of self service.\nThese emerging IT trends in the industry, together with the growing need to proactively manage cybersecurity in the air transport industry, will be two major focus areas at the event with SITA executives leading panel discussions on both topics.\nHani El-Assaad, SITA President, Middle East, India & Africa, said: \u201cInnovation continues to reshape the air transport industry and will be key to managing the continued growth in passenger traffic across the Middle East.

I honestly don't see whats wrong with it. What is the difference between playing Minecraft and playing COD III or other games of that nature. Minecraft is the same age rating as many other popular games, so I don't see the problem. However, I recently thought to myself that those YouTube videos where some 25year old man who needs some cash \"trolls\" his brother or something and gets a ton of views. I honestly hate the people who have used the nature of Minecraft to their advantage, because they've ruined the image of the game.\nNevertheless, I stay fairly popular within my class (the other 2 kids who play Minecraft get hella hell) and I just roll along with it.

The Youths alleged that Buhari has failed the Nigerian youths especially by not fulfilling his electoral promises for them. The National President of the Yoruba Youths Congress (YYC) who doubles as the Chairman, Coalition of South West Youths Group, Prince Dapo Adepoju lamented that the President has pushed the Youths to the back seat. Adepoju spoke to reporters in Akure, the Ondo State capital on Wednesday, while receiving youth leaders of tertiary institutions who came from Ghana on a courtesy visit to the group. He said Buhari has failed to extend hands of fellowship and friendship to the Nigerian youths. The group noted that the choice of the present Minister for youth was a wrong one as he\u2019s far above the stipulated age to be addressed as youth. \u201cWe contributed the largest votes, yet, we are the ones that are jobless and taken for granted, We will not accept this anymore, \u201cHe said. Adepoju said lots of corrections can still be made to pacify the youths by providing employment for youths who are roaming around the streets. He said youths stakeholders will consult and agree on a particular presidential candidate to support in the 2019 general election. Adepoju said the united efforts of the Youths was the reason for the technical defeat of Nnamdi Kanu. \u201cWe were united and we all agreed that we will not support his sentimental agitation. Had it been we gave him support, it would have been another story today. \u201cHow many youths are in his cabinet, in fact the president has not deemed it fit to appreciate efforts of youths stakeholders in supporting him to kill the bad intentions of Nnamdi Kanu. \u201cInstead, people who were not part of the struggle were the ones being commended, In fact the vice President met with them who were mostly elders, This to us is not good enough. Adepoju said the Nigerian youths have decided that only a presidential candidate irrespective of his/her political party that will give youths attention will get their support in 2019.

I didn't ever feel a need to buy a copy of the album. It was blaring out of speakers pointed outside dorm room windows throughout my teenage years. But it's only when you listen to the entire album that you realize what a cool concept this is: A live album about a musician's life on the road, recorded onstage, in rehearsal rooms, in Holiday Inn suites and on a bus. Only complaint: David Lindley's lap steel guitar is almost too present on the record. \nThis is the 70's so it should be no surprise how often cocaine is mentioned : \nIn \"The Road \": Coffee in the morning cocaine afternoons\n In \"Cocaine\" : Cocaine, running all 'round my brain\nIn \"Nothing But Time : I got a broken white line (I'm still sober) \n\n\nFrom Rolling Stone 's Paul Nelson: \n\nAs our finest practicing romantic, Jackson Browne has been stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again for so long that the road probably looks like a realistic way of life to him. Whether or not he knows it, he's been writing about highways and their alternate routes since his beginnings, so the subject matter of Running on Empty aren't all that different from those of his first four LPs. But the approach is. This time, Browne has consciously created a documentary, as brightly prosaic as it is darkly poetic, with a keen eye for the mundane as well as the magical. Running on Empty is a live album of new material about life on the road as conceived and recorded by a band of touring musicians in the places they spend most of their time (onstage, backstage, in hotel rooms, even on the bus). Since there are two separate concepts here, the audience gets an unprecedented double feature: ten songs they've never heard Browne sing, and a behind-the-scenes look at the \"the show they didn't see.\" Ostensibly, the Gawain of rock and roll has scaled down his heroic obsessions, re-covered the Round Table with Formica and invited us in for a cup of truck-stop coffee, thus proving a point we knew all along: that small gestures can be just as meaningful and revealing as large ones. \n\n Ironically, when Browne tries for specifics, he achieves both facts and universals. But his inclination to ease up makes sense here because he's really running two different, very dangerous races: one positively mythopoetic (the Road and its metaphorical implications), the other presumably maudlin (musicians on the road). The first can barley be done justice to within the confines of a pop record, while the second has rarely risen above its inherent cliches. \n\n\nIf a full-fledged mythology of the road didn't exist, we'd undoubtedly have to invent one, but the job has already been done by the same people who gave us the sky and the sea: i.e., practically every artist and thinker who ever lived. On the road, there's that old gray magic, asphalt camaraderie and the special language of musicians who mark time by gigs and guitar cases. Section guitarist Danny Kortchmar's \"Shaky Town\" captures perfectly all the desperate exhilaration of playing \"a thousand bands\" on \"those one-night stands,\" and Browne raises the hair on the back of your neck with his passionate singing. There's \"Nothing but Time\" on the bus and \"Cocaine\" in the hotel room, both recorded on location. On one song, tour photographer Joel Bernstein sings harmony on the chorus. Funny things happen when you're subtle, rueful and witty \"Rosie\" (written by Browne and his production manager, Donald \"Buddha\" Miller), a groupie the sound mixer craves leaves with a star, so the mixer must, if he wants any loving that night, once again take himself in hand. In \"You Love the Thunder,\" Browne forges a temporary relationship with a kindred spirit, only to realize \"You can dream/But you can never go back the way you came.\" Browne looks back on his life in \"Running on Empty,\" a pragmatic hobo's lullaby and the hymn of the Harvard cowboy. It's what daydreamers have nightmares about:  \n\nSixty-nine I was twenty-one and I called the road my own  \nI don't even know when that road turned onto the road I'm on....  \nYou know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find  \nRunning into the sun but I'm running behind.   \n\nBest of all, there's a finale. \"The Load-Out\" is Jackson Browne's tribute to and summation of every aspect of live performance: the cheering audience out front, the band playing hard-nosed rock and roll, the backstage crew loading up the trucks -- and, always, the road to the next town. Packed to capacity with the data of first-rate reporting and with music so warm and soaring it belies the album's title, this song flows triumphantly into Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs' \"Stay,\" where Browne tells us he doesn't ever want it to end.  \n\n What I really like about Running on Empty probably has little to do with the generosity or genius of its dual concepts, with the songwriter's craftmanship skill, with how much I admire the music of David Lindley and the Section, but rather with Jackson Browne himself. In other words, as impressed as I am with Jackson Browne's art, I'm even more impressed with the humanity that shines through it. Maybe they're inseparable, but I doubt it. \n\n\nFrom Robert Christgau's B+ review ( the best scire he would give any Jackson Browne album):\n\nOut of the studio -- this was recorded on tour -- Jackson sounds relaxed verbally, vocally, even instrumentally. He cuts his own meager melodies with nice ones by Danny O'Keefe and Danny Kortchmar. He does a funny and far from uncritical version of \"Cocaine\" and a loving and far from unfunny version of \"Stay.\" I consider this his most attractive album. But his devotees may consider the self-effacement a deprivation.  \n\n\n\nFrom Billboard :\n\nPresented here are 10 new selections from this gifted singer/songwriter, all recorded live onstage, as well as in hotel rooms, from a recent cross-country tour. The material deals mainly with experiences of the brief road encounters, loneliness and roadies -- all done with Browne's evocative, haunting and penetrating insight. Music is a mix of soft rock ballads and pounding, uptempo tunes with the Section (Craig Doerge on keyboards, Danny Kortchmer on guitars, Russ Kunkel on drums, Leland Sklar on bass, as well as David Lindley on electric fiddle and lap steel) supporting Browne's piano. Best cuts: \"Running On Empty,\" \"The Road,\" \"You Love The Thunder,\" \"Love Needs A Heart,\" \"The Load Out.\" \n\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jackson browne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul nelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert christgau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maurice williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david lindley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danny kortchmar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danny kortchmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "formica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "browne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russ kunkel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danny o'keefe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig doerge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leland sklar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joel bernstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gawain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "harvard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "memphis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:24.013+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c42ed734e4ad86f5f29bb00588104804931f0995", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQm7fCo_4vxmXxXc7C3bK8B32lZnsS0zva0MdzwdP.1H5aEIsnGY_n2TYFX2TZuqWO0BfVzp0QtGYksr.BxLVzSlWhWeZLcEX6w8qnBYS_JkA--", "site_full": "byelobogwhitegod.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://byelobogwhitegod.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "SOTA A.W.O.L.

Hours later, another woman said Franken inappropriately squeezed \"a handful of flesh\" on her waist while posing for a photo with her in 2009. That brought the number of women alleging misconduct by Franken to at least eight.\nFranken, the former comedian who made his name on \"Saturday Night Live,\" faces a chorus of calls to step aside, and Democratic senators said they expected their liberal colleague to resign.\n\"Enough is enough,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. \"We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is OK, none of it is acceptable, and we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard.\"\nGillibrand was the first to call for Franken's resignation on Wednesday, but a torrent of Democrats quickly followed.\n\"I'm shocked and appalled by Sen. Franken's behavior,\" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time. It's time for him to step aside.\"\nThough the writing appeared to be on the wall, Franken's departure was not certain. A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Franken's Twitter account said: \"Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate.\"\nLate in the day, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York added his voice.\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., answers a question about her statement on Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., at the end of a news conference on sexual harassment in the workplace, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) \"I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately,\" Schumer said.\nThe resignation demands came in rapid succession even though Franken on Wednesday vehemently denied the new accusation that came from a former Democratic congressional aide, who said he tried to forcibly kiss her after a taping of his radio show in 2006.\nThe woman, who was not identified, told Politico that Franken pursued her after her boss had left and she was collecting her belongings. She said that she ducked to avoid his lips and that Franken told her: \"It's my right as an entertainer.\"\nFranken, in a statement, said the idea he would claim such conduct as a right was \"preposterous.\"\nBut it was soon clear that his position had become untenable.\nFellow Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke to Franken, wrote on Twitter, \"I am confident he will make the right decision.\"\nThe pressure only mounted Tuesday, when Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. Rep Ruben Kihuen, D-Nev., faces pressure to resign as well over allegations reported by Buzzfeed that he repeatedly propositioned a former campaign worker.\nWhile Franken apparently is departing, Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore could be arriving, if he prevails in a Dec. 12 special election. Multiple women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were teens and he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. If Moore is elected, it could create a political nightmare for Republicans, who have promised an ethics probe.\nFrom left, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Gretchen Carlson, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., hold a news conference to introduce legislation to curb sexual harassment in the workplace, on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, in Washington. Gillibrand and fellow female Democratic senators have united in calling for Sen. Al Franken to resign amid sexual misconduct allegations. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) A national conversation about sexual harassment has intensified this fall after the heavily publicized case of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of many acts of sexual misconduct, including rape, by actresses and other women. Just on Wednesday, Time magazine named as its person of the year the \"silence breakers\" \u2014 women who have come forward on sexual harassment.\nPunishment has been swift for leaders in entertainment, media and sports while members of Congress have tried to survive the onslaught of allegations.\nFranken already faced a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into previous claims by several other women that he groped them or sought to forcibly kiss them.\nThe allegations began in mid-November when Leeann Tweeden, now a Los Angeles radio anchor, accused him of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 USO tour in Afghanistan.\nOther allegations followed, including a woman who says Franken put his hand on her buttocks as they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two women told the Huffington Post that Franken squeezed their buttocks at political events during his first campaign for the Senate in 2008. A fourth woman, an Army veteran, alleged Franken cupped her breast during a photo on a USO tour in 2003.\nFranken has apologized for his behavior but has also disputed some of the allegations.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Juliet Linderman in Washington and Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama, contributed to this report.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

"published": "2017-12-07T14:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I played with the new Oculus Home beta earlier today. It's pretty nice!\nThe room they give you is smaller than most SteamVR Home environments, and there's no workshop so it's just what Oculus gives you, but what they have is very shiny and generally more polished than the SteamVR environments. Not by a huge amount in the case of the fancier environments like Summit Pavilion (SteamVR Home's default) or Driftwood, but the floors and walls and items seem to have a little more pop to them. I'd guess the room is about the size of Summit Pavilion, without the outdoor section.\nOne wall of the room is open to an outdoor environment, which currently has 3 choices -- some Greek or Byzantine-looking architecture (I guess? I don't know architecture; lots of columns) overlooking a large bay with ships in it (this is the default exterior, and the best one in my opinion), a fantasy space scene with some planets, asteroids and a sun all floating close to each other, and the high cityscape from the Oculus Dreamdeck. I think they really ought to run with the planet, just a giant, slowly rotating Earth without all the extra clutter, but eh.\nA popup menu has a large list of objects (I think I have 77 out of 300 or something), which includes alternate walls, floors, ceilings, as well as furniture and props. Tons of plaques for your games and achievements. Plus cartridges, ugh; that's one VR trope I'm not super fond of. Again, no workshop and no importing artwork, so I can't stick pictures of my cats on the wall. Boo.\nGrabbing things and putting them down seems less janky than SteamVR Home, and you can pull and push objects from a distance instead of actually picking them up, which is a big quality of life improvement. I wish there were an option to always be pointing, like the old behavior; the new Home wants you to make the pointing gesture to do any selecting, but there's never any time I don't want those laser pointers.\nThe new Dash works well, which is a huge improvement. Instead of the old Oculus menu there's a ribbon with panels for settings, stickied programs, your library, etc. Basically like the SteamVR menu, I guess, but the simpler layout works better for me. It has a virtual desktop button, too, which is handy. I wish you could sticky it, though, like leave it stuck to the wall or wherever, but I think you have to put it away to interact with anything else (or maybe it was that it kept following you around? There was something inconvenient about it). Unlike Virtual Desktop, I don't see an option to switch between a curved and flat window, it's stuck on curved.\nIt seems like they got rid of the reset view button, which seems like a big, I assume unintentional, omission. Switching between roomscale and cockpit/driving games is kind of a pain otherwise.\nI don't think there's any way to save more than one environment. Since there's no importing it doesn't matter as much as with SteamVR, but I still wish we had more control over the save file.\nAs with SteamVR Home, I think it will be pretty great as long as they keep working on it. I certainly hope they provide some new room layouts with more space.\nAlso nice -- I like that Oculus sent an email about today's Flash sale this time, although I didn't see anything I wanted to buy. Well, Lone Echo & the second Call of the Starseed game, but the discounts weren't significant enough with Fallout 4 VR coming next week. Also, the store is getting kind of unwieldy and could use a list view, at least in the browser interface.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:25.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c5d8d87d206febab907a3e032d1b9e268918e857", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl_PUTJwv0jfaxzxb86_du8zN0UFAGQjtoK9CufE3iiADJsjOMWV4JMcOUTfFryS15Q--", "site_full": "forums.penny-arcade.com", "site": "penny-arcade.com", "site_section": "http://forums.penny-arcade.com/categories/games-and-technology", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Games and Technology \u2014 Penny Arcade", "title": "I love [VIRTUAL REALITY], it's so bad. 59", "title_full": "I love [VIRTUAL REALITY], it's so bad. - Page 59 \u2014 Penny Arcade", "published": "2017-12-06T03:26:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://us.v-cdn.net/5018289/uploads/8DDBNVR065TV.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8253, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fcebc8f580cc1c0a4af1f29e2ad725a14c872d92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyggHgoOVy9TMDWTEMJi4jQ_AfNI6u4qLL71YWM0VxMl_PUTJwv0jfaxzxb86_du8zN0UFAGQjtoK9CufE3iiADJsjOMWV4JMf74dVON7PaTl7WWKWdv0ZD", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Rothgarr", "published": "2017-12-07T01:28:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "PSVR Gran Turismo bundle only $199 next week:\nhttps://uploadvr.com/psvr-gran-turismo-sport-drops-200-next-week/\nhttp://www.prwmusic.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://uploadvr.com/psvr-gran-turismo-sport-drops-200-next-week/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:18:25.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "88fbaea69e7341ffcb2f52d175f14762edf2f5bd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPKrBQP5sFZCHhWEeQbVqY_CKMKKXWh5f2OOCsUJZKsivdc0S7BOH2LNr2ym7nNsMmnWtUq4srHritOwjuNYsquj6oiFsEalxzWZ7UYED3rdxBDBw_P2TpoR", "site_full": "www.avforums.com", "site": "avforums.com", "site_section": "https://www.avforums.com/forums/sony-tvs-forum.113/", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Sony TVs Forum | AVForums", "title": "XE90 frame repeats/drops on 50/59.94 native content (49XE9005) | Page 7", "title_full": "Sony XE90 frame repeats/drops on 50/59.94 native content (49XE9005) | Page 7 | AVForums", "published": "2017-12-06T23:17:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.avforums.com/styles/avf/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10709, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a55f9d825d523ca4c07b2960b5fe9495c5113d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqAY0p_pThMNXYjTfiRMt4Wa_4D_DSKPKrBQP5sFZCHhWEeQbVqY_CKMKKXWh5f2OOCsUJZKsivdc0S7BOH2LNr2ym7nNsMmnWtUq4srHritOwjuNYsquj6oiFsEalxzWZ7UYED3rdxGDIpa3YV7svThrzCK3ldCY-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "meltonglyn", "published": "2017-12-06T23:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Emick81 said: \u2191 Sportsmode.\nTested every other setting on the first xe9005 that I got.
