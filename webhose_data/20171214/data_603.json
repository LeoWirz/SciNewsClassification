(Photo: Philp Lemonte) \u2014 \nROSE HALL, St James \u2014 Veteran reggae ambassador, Dr James Chambers, more popularly known as Jimmy Cliff, was among three people conferred with Honorary Fellowship of the Montego Bay Community College (MBCC) during Sunday\u2019s graduation exercise for students of that Montego Bay based-educational facility, held at the Montego Bay Convention Centre. \nThe others were Westmoreland businessman Russel Hammond and environmentalist Hugh Shim. \nThe trio formed the fifth batch to be awarded as Honorary Fellows by the tertiary institution that opened its doors in September 1975 as an amalgamation of the sixth forms of Cornwall College, Montego Bay High and Mount Alvernia High schools. \n\u201cThe Montego Bay Community College is extremely proud to salute them as our fifth set of Honorary Fellows and induct them into our company of Fellows,\u201d Nathan Robb, chairman of the MBCC board declared, ahead of the reading of citations for the three men. \nPrincipal of the Montego Bay Community College, Dr Maureen Nelson, explained that the Fellowship is reserved for people who have made extraordinary and sustained contribution to the college or western Jamaica, throughout their career. \nShe added that the honor is awarded to individuals whose professional career has been marked by the highest standards of ethical conduct, professionalism, civility and collegiality. \n\u201cThe Montego Bay Community College is participating today (Sunday) in a practice and custom, a ritual and a celebration, characterized by the educational foundation since medieval times. Today, Montego Bay Community College follows in that pathway to observe one of the historical conventions which we hope will promote and motivate excellence,\u201d Dr Nelson noted. \n\u201cThis is an award which is not given lightly, its historic value should be cherished.\u201d \nShe noted that the processes which govern the selection have been rigorous and meticulous. \nDr Chambers, a native of Somerton, St James, was hailed as a cultural icon and musician extraordinaire, who has made an invaluable contribution to the entertainment landscape, both locally and internationally. \nA former politician, Hammond was born in Ramble, Hanover. Known for his spirit of volunteerism and kindness, Hammond in 1974 established Hammond\u2019s Pastry in Savanna-la-Mar, and has since impacted the lives of hundreds of persons across the political divide. \nShim, who was hailed for his long-lasting association with the MBCC, is a founding member of the college hospitality advisory board. He also lectures at the institution on a part-time basis and has been credited for conceptualizing a raft of programs for the college. \nHe is also an executive director of the Montego Bay Marine Park. \nAnd following a few words of appreciation on behalf of the 2017 Fellows, the reggae stalwart broke out in songs such as Many Rivers to Cross, It\u2019s been a Hard Road to Travel, My Miss Jamaica and I Can See Clearly Now , much to the delight of the audience. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name":

(Photo: Garfield Robinson) \u2014- \nEMBATTLED singer George Nooks\u2019s case was rescheduled to March 27, 2018 when he appeared before Judge Vaughn Smith in the Kingston and St Andrew Parish Court in Half-Way-Tree yesterday. \nThe entertainer, who is charged with possession of cocaine, had his bail extended to the new trial date. \nJudge Smith advised Nooks\u2019s attorney, Donahue Martin, that the case should be tried in the Drug Treatment Court. However, Martin said his team is opposed to this move. \n\u201cHe (Nooks) has been disputing what has taken place and that has not changed. I don\u2019t think I will be able to comment on the plan moving forward for the defence,\u201d Martin told the Jamaica Observer shortly after leaving the courthouse. \nMartin also received the judge\u2019s approval to review the Duhaney Park Police Station\u2019s narcotics and crime diaries from the period May 4 \u2014 10, 2017. According to the attorney, this request will allow the defence to review the documented events surrounding the case. \nNooks is also being represented by Queen\u2019s Counsel Tom Tavares-Finson. \nThe case has already seen two hearings \u2014 May 17 and July 21. George Nooks \nAccording to police reports, on May 5, 56-year-old Nooks was seen by an anti-narcotics team in the Duhaney Park community after 9:00pm acting in a suspicious manner. He was accosted and a bag he was carrying searched. The bag was found to contain approximately two ounces of cocaine. \nNooks rose to fame in the 1970s using the moniker Prince Mohammed. He had chart success with hits including Tribal War and Forty Leg Dread . \nIn later years, Nooks won over a legion of fans with his gospel-inspired tracks including God Is Standing By and a cover of Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s Bridge Over Troubled Water . \n\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sade gardner  observer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew pari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george nooks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vaughn smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prince mohammed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donahue martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garfield robinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom tavares-finson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garfunkel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "duhaney park police station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drug treatment court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamaica observer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nooks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st andrew parish court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kingston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duhaney park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "half-way-tree", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:11.024+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7abe11d9b731a36a23d27a1f15b1c38702c7bd9e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWsV06iVo3EgTxukiHo.7hz_6BlcVvExQuqNJb4__JonE9dewiahnTmCATZAypWllPdJFVx_iadqOk_53fOdoaSCJdtezFBF3FWQMxzBYzShJagX59cQRmv8oIRnCF4d0UCKXhbC2Y4AE-", "site_full": "www.lazada.com.my", "site": "lazada.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.lazada.com.my/nivea/lazada-supermart-all-deals/", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "Nivea Products for the Best Price in Malaysia", "title": "Nivea Men Whitening Oil Control Scrub 100 gm", "title_full": "Nivea Men Whitening Oil Control Scrub 100 gm | Lazada Malaysia", "published": "2017-11-13T13:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.05, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1954, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f720ac0c0db3d1a542e2e511a0c4bba47b2d636", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBEizd88NP0xL.H7KVxgAWsV06iVo3EgTxukiHo.7hz_6BlcVvExQuqNJb4__JonE9dewiahnTmCATZAypWllPdJFVx_iadqOk_53fOdoaSCJdtezFBF3FWQMxzBYzShJagX59cQRmv8oIRnCF4d0UrXwZ3mdS4aq4SFuj6plJVg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Jeremy J.", "published": "2017-11-22T10:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "Three Stars", "text": "Product no issue.

Yes, Tiger Zinda Hai arrives in theaters a couple of weeks from now. However, theaters still need to have some sort of occupancy to keep them running and one can just hope that Fukrey Returns bring in some luck for the industry at the least. Box Office Predictions \u2013 Fukrey Returns Fukrey [2013] was a good comic affair and over a period of time has been remembered quite fondly. It was a harmless film that did make you smile and laugh alternatively. The promo of the film\u2019s sequel suggests that the laughter would continue this time around as well. In fact, this is also one of the rare true sequels with the same set of characters taking forward the story from where it ended during the first instalments. Trending All of this means that even a decent start of 3-4 crore for this medium budget film would be some sort of relief at least for Bollywood.

Apple CEO speaks up for the Dreamers!\nAs deadline for the DACA program nears, a number of business leaders are speaking out in favor of the Dreamers. In a recent forum Apple CEO Tim Cook was the latest of a long list of American business leaders who have been vocal in their support for continuing the DACA program. To know more about the DACA program and the continuing debate around it see here and here.\nApple CEO speaks up for Dreamers\nThe DACA dreamers found support for their cause from the CEO of Apple Inc., Tim Cook. He spoke about the topic of Immigration in general and the issue of DACA in particular at a conference that was held in New York recently. He stated that there were at least 250 employees of Apple, who were beneficiaries of the DACA program and expressed concern about their wellbeing should the program be ended. Stating that the dreamers were pillars of the communities they belonged to and people who held jobs and paid taxes, he stated that throwing them out of the country would stand against everything that America represented. \nHe called the decision to end DACA unacceptable and stated that he was shocked that there was even a need for discussion. According to Tim Cook, the decision to continue the DACA is about human dignity and nothing else. He also went on to state that he was in favor of More Immigration in USA and getting more smart people into the country as it is the smart people who create more jobs and boost the economy\nTech leaders weigh in on DACA\nEven before this, the Apple CEO along with a number of other business leaders in the tech world spoke up about the DACA issue. The CEOS and leaders of a number of tech and other companies came together to sign an open letter in favor of keeping the DACA Program intact. The open letter was signed by Tech stalwarts such as Satya Nadella, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and many others. \nFor companies like Microsoft, which hire thousands of employees based on their merit alone, the employees who work under DACA program are a key part of their company\u2019s work force. According to Microsoft it employs 27 people who benefit from the DACA program and has identified them as the top in their respective fields. The current Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella stated that he felt that the issue of the dreamers was one that touched him personally as he too was a product of immigration. \nThe founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates too spoke out in strong terms against the decision to rescind the DACA program. Speaking via a post on Facebook Bill Gates cited his disappointment with decision, stating that the Dreamers represented the best instincts of this country and that the program shielded deserving young Immigrants who came with their families from being deported. He went on to say that United States was made better by people who come here from other places and dedicate their commitment into moving the country forward.\nHe joined a number of CEOs in hoping that Congress would expedite the process to pass a permanent solution that would allow the dreamers to stay on without the fear of deportation looming over them.\nTo know more about DACA and why it is best to Immigrate through legal channels get in touch with Global Tree at Begumpet, Hyderabad the Most Trusted Immigration Consultant in India.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satya nadella", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "globa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tim cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark zuckerberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "begumpet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyderabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:12.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba6cd41fca84dffefa947e891015e74c9ca28b78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCA68oLtJW88tQq4Y2r_dTDuROAOGZxllBPnEjddQWzcBZpPgfY6KoIpw8PCSBeZWRF_SWOalMBbNiZUIlaqic", "site_full": "rossellapompeo.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://rossellapompeo.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Il cammino e\u2019 luce \u2013 To Be By Your Side di Rossella Pompeo", "title": "Il cammino e\u2019 luce", "title_full": "Il cammino e\u2019 luce", "published": "2017-11-21T15:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IT", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "517c307fbe3101e309592b484dc8cba9434e6604", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCA68oLtJW88tQq4Y2r_dTDuROAOGZxllBPnEjddQWzcBZpPgfY6KoIpw8PCSBeZWRF_SWOalMBQ_mVlomheZeJp9FsaHSsUY-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Umberto Rondi", "published": "2017-11-21T15:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Bella!\nMi piace Liked by 1 persona ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:59:12.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e6aaa5b7387a9a13f85a2f25603cf86f2902fe2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT5XcEZ0hqCOkpxZ6KGht__LpJfvl_zzLHZPTqfbrKCvEWnWHopoSAIjczExGYkLRrtdvL2Q_rQ4g--", "site_full": "greebohobbes.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://greebohobbes.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "O Green World \u2013 Random Shoes", "title": "O Green World", "title_full": "O Green World", "published": "2017-12-07T11:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6e6aaa5b7387a9a13f85a2f25603cf86f2902fe2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT5XcEZ0hqCOkpxZ6KGht__LpJfvl_zzLHZPTqfbrKCvEWnWHopoSAIjczExGYkLRrtdvL2Q_rQ4g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "greebohobbes", "published": "2017-12-07T11:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "O Green World", "text": "Sorrow is my name.\nMelodramatic as that might seem, it is true enough.\nI met a girl and lost a girl.

(PHOTO / AP) \nYANGON \u2013 Myanmar has expressed its opposition to a resolution of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) regarding the Rakhine issue, but pledged efforts to address the challenges of Rakhine state. \nThe United Nations Human Rights Council held a special session in Geneva Tuesday on \"Situation of human rights of Rohingya Muslims and other minorities in Myanmar\" \nOfficial media on Thursday published a statement of Myanmar Permanent Representative to UN U Htin Lynn in response to a draft resolution submitted to a special session of the UNHRC on Myanmar. \nREAD MORE: UN committee urges Myanmar to give citizenship to Rohingyas \nThe resolution tabled on Tuesday was titled \"Situation of human rights of Rohingya Muslims and other minorities in Myanmar.\" \nThe special session of the UNHRC was held in Geneva at the request of the member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). \nThe statement said Myanmar opposes any country's specific resolution which gives rise to polarization, division and confrontation, and it does not reflect the principles of the UNHRC such as impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity. \nThe draft resolution was focusing on a particular group of people belonging to a particular faith. The promotion and protection of human rights should be for all people of the globe irrespective of race, religion and gender, he said in the statement. \nHe pointed out that \"some elements in the draft resolution are infringing on the state sovereignty of Myanmar.

I\u2019ve been burnt so many times that I\u2019m now reluctant to spend good money on high-end earphones. Instead, I have resorted to getting the dirt cheap low quality variants that I have to replace every other month. A compromise that I don\u2019t really mind. But when you sit down to calculate the cost of shelling out \u20a6300 every other month for new earphones, it does begin to add up to something significant. \nSo when I recently received a review unit of the Xiaomi hybrid (dual-driver) earphones from Gearbest , I didn\u2019t really know what to expect. However, having spent the last few weeks with them, I\u2019ve come away quite impressed by how much they have to offer. Thoughtful design \nThe Xiaomi hybrid earphones feature a unique design that makes the product standout. I got the silver variant but it is also available in gold . Whatever variant you have, it\u2019s bound to command a second look, and eventual loan request, from friends. Advertisement Advertisement \nWhat I love most about the design is that the earbuds are bent at an angle of almost 45 degrees so they fit very well in the ear. \nYou will also notice that the cable is half rubber (from Y-connector up to ear buds) and half fabric (from Y-connector down to the 3.5mm jack. \nThis gives the impression that it is, to some extent, durable against wear and tear. We all know how unreliable thin rubber cables can be. HD sound quality \nWhile the Xiaomi hybrid earphones handle call quality pretty neatly, you will find that they shine even more when you play music. This is thanks to the hybrid dual driver system that dynamically balances sound output. As a result, complex sounds are well played out without sounding muffled and the basses and highs deliver without any noticeable distortion. \nI dare say the output quality is fuller than many sub-5k headphones (you know, the kind that cover your ears fully) I\u2019ve used. Versatile remote control (although there is a but) \nThe Xiaomi hybrid earphones come with a 3-button remote that can handle a range of functions. A normal press of the middle button will pause/play music and pick/hang up a call. A long press will activate Google Assistant on Android. A normal press of the upper and lower buttons will increase/decrease volume. Depending on the app, a long press will either allow you skip tracks or fast-forward/rewind (especially on Podcast apps) \nThere is one snag however. These functions do not exactly work for Apple products. So if you have an iPhone, iPod or any other Apple product, your experience might be different. Android users don\u2019t really have anything to worry about. Ridiculously cheap, yet delivers \nIf you are familiar with hybrid IEM technology , you\u2019ll know that earphones utilising it don\u2019t come cheap. I\u2019m talking from as low as $90 to as high as $1000, depending on the brand. \nSo at a standard $25 a pop, the Xiaomi earphones are easily the cheapest hybrid dual-driver earphones you will find around that actually deliver. You can order from Nigeria \nI mentioned earlier that I got my review unit from Gearbest, which happens to be based in China. Nevertheless, they ship to Nigeria for free and deliver in less than 2 weeks. \nThey are also currently running promo sales so you can get the Xiaomi hybrid earphones at a 65% discount ($15/ \u20a65000) right here .

As well as enjoying direct access to the lake, the lido boasts four outdoor swimming pools including a children\u2019s pool, heated spa pool and Olympic sized swimming pool whilst inside there are an additional three pools and waterslides. Not only that but there is also a diving pool as well as volleyball courts and table tennis. An on site cafe provides refreshments throughout the day but visitors are also welcome to bring in their own picnic. For those who prefer a quieter pace of life or even more indulgence, then sitting adjacent to the lido is the Termali Salini and Spa. Opened in 2014, this has a set of salt water baths set across a number of levels allowing guests to move from one to the other. A range of spa treatments are also available. @CheeseTraveller \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 5pm RT @HiClassMag: Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore #travel [link] @HiClassMag \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 3pm Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore #travel [link] @travelingNomadd \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 3pm Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore #luxurytravel [link] @offtotravelling \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 2pm Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] [link] @Travel_Advent \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 11am Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] [link] @booktaximajorca \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 10am Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] [link] @zesty_lifestyle \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 10am Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] [link] @booktaxivenice \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 9am Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] [link] @SandraGabriel_ \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 9am Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] @UKLuxForYou \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 9am Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] [link] @LuxuryPartner \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 9am Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] [link] @ShirleyCody75 \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 9am Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] [link] @Gettheluxtrip \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 9am Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] [link] @CrystalBryant85 \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 9am Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] [link] @LillieMiller88 \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 9am Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] [link] @BestOfMiamiTM \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 9am Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] TM Miami Tom\u00e1s A Manrique [link] @JenniferCook55 \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 9am Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] [link] @Trevorocity_ \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 8am New post on my blog: Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] @luxury__travel \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 8am New post on my blog: Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] @CMargoGR \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 8am \"Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore\" [link] #travel #luxury #sacramento #mortgage #realestate @laila_cakes \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 8am RT @SpottedPlaces: Top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore [link] @BookingsForYou \u00bb 07 Dec '17, 8am Thanks to @luxury__travel for publishing our post on the top 10 things to see and do on Lake Maggiore.

The tree form is collaged from fragments of cut up drawings and marks, some mounted on pieces of foam board.  I've left lots of clear space around it so that it appears detached from the surrounding context, floating within a void. O ak trees in the wild often have a kind of explosion quality in terms of their form and shapes. Here this aspect is reinforced by the stark battlefield feel of the surrounding landscape.   \n\n\nAbove drawing in progress, charcoal, crayon, pencil, 60 x 75 cm \n\nThe tree  form is a perhaps a bit too central in the composition. I don't like the symmetry here. I quite like the stark quality of the landscape but the classical ordering of space needs to be broken up in these works generally.  \n\n\nAbove drawing in progress, detail, charcoal, crayon, pencil on paper, 60 x 75 cm \n\nI've resolved the tree in the foreground of the piece featured  in my previous post and  reckon this work is done. I like the idea the viewer doesn't immediately read what the image is because of the abstraction. The bold contrasts of light and dark reminds me of mezzotint printmaking. It's got quite a strange, surreal quality, a kind of mood of anticipation.   \n\n\n\nAbove  drawing on paper, charcoal, crayon, graphite, foam board on paper, 60 x 75 cm \n\nAbove  drawing on paper, detail, charcoal, crayon, graphite, foam board on paper, 60 x 75 cm \n\nI've started a new board on Pinterest that aims to visually explore and contextualize my current work. It's called Fractured Landscape and features contemporary and art historical works. My aim will be to to develop it over time as I research further artists. If any reader can think of an artist or contextual reference for the work do let me know.

Slow Down Plan for a slower pace than you might usually attempt if solo or as a couple. Be realistic about what you can see and do when traveling with kids. Don\u2019t try to cram too much into your itinerary. The less you feel you have to see, the more enjoyable and stress-free for everyone.\nFor the most part, the pace of the trip should be set to what your youngest child can handle. Build into your agenda time for stops along the way for bathroom breaks, snack breaks, and nap time.
