This is a prospective, cross-sectional, study in a university-affiliated, tertiary-care hospital. We recruited 151 children with CP (mean age 6.11 years, SD 3.42, range 3\u201318yr). The Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System (EDACS) and the dysphagia scales of Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), Swallow Function Scales (SFS), and Food Intake Level Scale (FILS) were used. The Communication Function Classification System (CFCS) and Viking Speech Scale (VSS) were employed to classify communication function and speech intelligibility, respectively. The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) with the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GFMCS) and the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) level were also assessed. Spearman correlation analysis to investigate the associations between measures and univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to identify significant factors were used. Median GMFCS level of participants was III (interquartile range II\u2013IV). Significant dysphagia based on EDACS level III\u2013V was noted in 23 children (15.2%). There were strong to very strong relationships between the EDACS level with the dysphagia scales. The EDACS presented strong associations with MACS, CFCS, and VSS, a moderate association with GMFCS level, and a moderate to strong association with each domain of the PEDI.

But poor revenue collections may limit the scope of such efforts, he said. \nWidodo wants higher economic growth as he pursues his ambitious infrastructure agenda, including ramping up spending next year to record levels, but growth has been stuck around 5 percent since he took office three years ago. The government is also facing a persistent fiscal shortfall with revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product being significantly lower than peer economies and a tax-compliance rate among the region\u2019s worst. \n\u201cThe biggest problem for Indonesia is on the demand side,\u201d Basri said in an interview on Tuesday ahead of the Bloomberg Year Ahead Asia Conference in Jakarta. \u201cWe need to have a more aggressive fiscal policy, but unfortunately because the tax revenue is still a problem, we don\u2019t have the room to do so.\u201d \nIndonesia lags its peers in terms of government revenue, which is estimated by the International Monetary Fund at 14 percent of GDP. Moody\u2019s Investors Service has cited boosting revenue as a key factor in Indonesia winning another ratings upgrade. \nIn a country of 260 million people, only about 17 million registered taxpayers were required to submit returns this year and just 11.3 million actually paid their dues, official data show. Revenue from taxation was 991.2 trillion rupiah ($73.3 billion) at the end of October, or about 67 percent of the 2017 target. \nThe government and central bank must be wary of the impact of rising interest rates in the US and elsewhere on Indonesia\u2019s economy, according to Basri, who was the country\u2019s finance minister during the 2013 taper tantrum, when the US Federal Reserve\u2019s signal of stimulus withdrawal prompted an Indonesian sell-off. \nThe Southeast Asian nation is now seen less vulnerable to such external shocks with a current account deficit of less than 2 percent, subdued inflation and a budget deficit that\u2019s within a legal limit of 3 percent, Basri said. \nConsumer prices rose 3.3 percent in November, the slowest pace of growth in almost a year, data showed Monday. The low inflation environment in recent months paved the way for Bank Indonesia to deliver back-to-back interest rate cuts in August and September, on top of six reductions last year. \nStill, Basri doesn\u2019t see any room for further easing. \u201cStarting next year, if the ECB starts to end quantitative easing, starts tapering, if the US continues with normalisation and the consolidation of its balance sheet, I think Bank Indonesia should raise the interest rate,\u201d he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "basri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "widodo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chatib basri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joko widodo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moody\u2019s investors service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international monetary fund", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jakarta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:25.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3403b18c379c8127c126f9e3f9b393aebfcf643a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTfWUxJ2K2KH9X1SpU8XK.IpnSOFbcY_RMJiecIY.i6t5tzf_40sOzUbJfu3bPiUmaFjShsHokaut3ZmqtQHWG6ChHGGgZh2yMo8wwjbDdJzLIpet5YsxGcQkBw9yRScOPy8RDkuR01JiTdPga_NVzG0SwuenoMj44x0Kr.qT.2iQUR40KNSFFa", "site_full": "www.openpr.com", "site": "openpr.com", "site_section": "http://www.openpr.com/rss/category/6/Health-Medicine.xml?SID=105539b421c2cd45d6919fa4a2038333", "site_categories": ["marketing", "financial_news", "finance", "business"], "section_title": "openPR.com - New Public Relations: Health & Medicine", "title": "Hearing Implants Market: Global Demand, Growth Potential & Opportunity Outlook 2015 - Forecast to 2025", "title_full": "Hearing Implants Market: Global Demand, Growth Potential & Opportunity Outlook 2015 - Forecast to 2025", "published": "2017-12-07T11:17:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 43086, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3403b18c379c8127c126f9e3f9b393aebfcf643a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTfWUxJ2K2KH9X1SpU8XK.IpnSOFbcY_RMJiecIY.i6t5tzf_40sOzUbJfu3bPiUmaFjShsHokaut3ZmqtQHWG6ChHGGgZh2yMo8wwjbDdJzLIpet5YsxGcQkBw9yRScOPy8RDkuR01JiTdPga_NVzG0SwuenoMj44x0Kr.qT.2iQUR40KNSFFa", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Future Market Insights", "published": "2017-12-07T11:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "Hearing Implants Market: Global Demand, Growth Potential & Opportunity Outlook 2015 - Forecast to 2025", "text": "Press release from: Future Market Insights PR Agency: Future Market Insights Hearing implants are an option when conventional hearing aids no longer give enough benefit. Implants are designed for different types of hearing loss. They are surgically implanted devices which can give you the sensation of sound. Hearing loss can be caused by many different causes, some of which can be successfully treated with medicine or surgery, depending on the disease process. There are three types of Hearing loss: Conductive hearing loss, Sensorineural hearing loss and Mixed hearing loss. According to the WHO's estimates, there will be approximately 1.2 billion people in the world over the age of 60 by 2025. This marks a shift in population demographics, from a demographic majority of young people globally to a more balanced proportion of young and old. There are around 360 million people in the world with disabling hearing loss. Hearing loss is one of the six leading global disease burden. According to the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, the prevalence of hearing loss increases with age, affecting 42% of people over 50 and more than 70% of people over 70. Rising life expectancy is therefore likely to result in an increasing numbers of people living with hearing loss.

Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio, left, and Keith Gregg, the county's Chief Information Technology Officer, right, speak at a press conference Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017, at the Government Center about t... \nBy JONATHAN DREWAssociated Press \nA North Carolina county was working Thursday on the lengthy process of fixing its computer systems after refusing to pay off a hacker who used ransomware to freeze dozens of local government servers. \nIt will take days to restore Mecklenburg County's computer system, local officials said, leaving residents in North Carolina's most populous metro area facing delays or disruptions to county services. Deputies were processing jail inmates by hand and building code inspectors switched to paper records after a county employee unleashed the malicious software earlier this week by opening an email attachment. \nCounty manager Dena Diorio said late Wednesday that the county will not pay the $23,000 demanded by the hacker believed to be in Ukraine or Iran. Diorio said it would have taken days to restore the county's computer system even if officials paid off the person controlling the ransomware, so the decision won't significantly lengthen the timeframe. \n\"I am confident that our backup data is secure and we have the resources to fix this situation ourselves,\" said Diorio. Describing county services, she said: \"We are slower, but we are up and running.\" \nThe county of more than 1 million residents includes Charlotte, but the city government appears not to have been compromised by the attack. The state's largest city issued a statement that its separate computer systems have not been affected and that it severed direct connections to county computers. \nThe computer problems haven't affected the processing of emergency calls because they are handled by the city, said Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anjanette Flowers Grube. \nSuch attacks are becoming more common - and more sophisticated. A security expert said he reads about a local government being targeted every couple of months. For example, a hacking attack in late 2016 on San Francisco's mass transit system led its operators to allow free rides over part of a weekend because of data problems. \nRoss Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at the firm Cybereason, said local governments are \"easy targets\" because of their older equipment and software. Paying the ransom can often be cheaper than other ways of recovering the data. \n\"Once you're in that situation, you really have no good option, so a lot of people and companies end up paying,\" he said. \nThe North Carolina cyberattack has caused delays for the Mecklenburg County jail and disrupted other county services ranging from domestic violence counseling to tax collection. Sheriff Irwin Carmichael said it's taking longer to manually process arrestees, as well as inmates due to be released. \nCalls to a county domestic violence hotline are rolling straight to voicemail, so counselors are checking messages every 15 minutes, officials told reporters. And the social services department is working to recreate its daily itinerary of 1,600 rides for elderly patients with medical appointments. Recurring appointments that account for most of the rides are less of a problem than those for patients who make one-time reservations. \nMeanwhile, payments to the tax office must be made with a check, cash or money order, and code inspectors have been slowed down by having to use paper records, according to a list of affected services. \nDiorio said county computers began to suffer Monday from the attack, which was publicly revealed the next day. A forensic examination shows 48 of the county's 500 servers were affected, Diorio said, adding that county government officials believe the hacker wasn't able to gain access to individuals' health, credit card or social security information. \nThe compromised servers have been quarantined, and even potentially healthy parts of the system were shut down to avoid spreading the malicious program, said Keith Gregg, the county's chief information officer. But without getting the compromised servers unlocked, the county will have to rebuild significant parts of the system. \nDiorio said county technology officials will use backup data from before the ransomware attack to restore the system, but the rebuild will take \"patience and hard work.\" \n___ \nFollow Drew on Twitter at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew .

Foot Locker West champ Kashon Harrison representing Navajo Nation", "text": "Foot Locker West champ Kashon Harrison representing Navajo Nation Published by \nHarrison inspired by Pre, determined to succeed \nBy Mary Albl of DyeStat \nWhen Kashon Harrison needs some motivation, he goes old school and channels the spirit of Steve Prefontaine . \nHarrison, a junior from Kirtland Central High in New Mexico, finds inspiration from Pre's quotes, grit and mental toughness. \n\u201cKashon is really motivated by Prefontaine and the way he approached races,\u201d Kirtland Central cross country coach Lenny Esson said. \nHarrison has used that fortitude to propel himself onto the national running scene this fall. \nHe\u2019s won all but one of his races, including a New Mexico 5A state title (15:54.9), and most recently the Foot Locker West Regional crown, clocking 15 minutes, 38.4 seconds on the 5-kilometer course Saturday at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, Calif. \nHarrison, who rebounded from an eighth-place finish Nov. 18 at NXR Southwest in Casa Grande, Ariz., heads to the 39th Foot Locker Nationals this Saturday to compete at Balboa Park\u2019s Morley Field in San Diego. \n\u201cThis year I wanted to train more, and I did train more,\u201d Harrison said matter-of- factly. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m going to Foot Locker Nationals and I\u2019m excited for that.\u201d \nAs simple as Harrison explained his success this year, it\u2019s been so much more than that. \nEsson, who has worked with Harrison since the eighth grade, said Harrison has developed his overall base and understanding of the sport. He\u2019s honed in on his self-described \u201clack of a kick\u201d and has matured. He\u2019s a quiet, but self-driven runner. \n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have pure natural speed at the end, but I think he really is mentally a lot stronger than most of the competition he\u2019s been up against,\u201d Esson said. \u201cHe wants to make them hurt early and push the pace.\u201d \nHarrison comes from an athletic background. His mom played basketball and his father, Vernon , ran for Kirtland Central, winning a state title in 1999. Harrison splits his time between Farmington, N.M. and Red Valley, Ariz., where his dad lives. \nHe makes the roughly 45-minute to hour commute from Red Valley to Kirtland often. He\u2019s currently training in Red Valley because of the slightly higher altitude. \nWhat has also been a motivating factor for Harrison is the opportunity to represent his Native American culture through running. Harrison, who lives on a reservation, is part of the Navajo Nation. He\u2019s been involved in Wings of America \u2013 an organization founded in 1988, which provides Native youth a platform to express their identity through distance running. \n\u201cIt means a lot,\u201d Harrison said of his opportunity. \u201cIt gives me motivation to push more to represent how I was running from my freshman year to my junior year and now heading to nationals.\u201d \nEsson said the area they are located, they are surrounded by other tribes, but all in all, the native population is very proud of what Harrison is doing. \n\u201cWe have a lot of obstacles and barriers that we have here on the reservation, that a lot of the kids don\u2019t have the opportunity,\u201d Esson explained. \u201cFor him (Harrison) to do something like this, it opens a lot of doors for our youth, not only competing at this level, but in short term, setting goals.\u201d \nHarrison follows in good company of fellow Wings of America products to compete at Foot Locker. \nProgram Director Dustin Martin mentioned Becki Wells (1991, 1992), Tim and Theo Martin (1992), Brandon Leslie (1993, 1994), Felicia Guliford (2001) and Julia Foster (2010) as some of the individuals to make it to nationals. \nEsson said the 5K course at Balboa Park, with its hills, plays to Harrison\u2019s strengths. \n\u201cA big part of his success is that training his mental aspects of how to prepare for a race and how to race,\u201d Esson said. \nAnd like his idol Prefontaine, Harrison said he wants to leave a lasting impression through his running. \n\u201cI want to be remembered,\u201d Harrison said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kashon harrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "becki wells", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "esson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theo martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dustin martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prefontaine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vernon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary albl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lenny esson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "felicia guliford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julia foster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandon leslie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve prefontaine", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "navajo nation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirtland central", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wings of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foot locker nationals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nxr southwest", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kirtland central high", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirtland central", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ariz.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.m.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mt. san antonio college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "casa grande", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirtland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walnut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balboa park\u2019s morley field", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "farmington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balboa park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:26.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "55738ce8ca6aa65fb170625dd75df8b7ffbd62b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nZOCJivZzescL.JpS5yLU1ZQBoeYJpx.YWDCd3IBibkv_G_U5Fa82iyGZvZeHZPrGYb7374ala13R3TTAmMC9LZxkDZRya382HuCUBpvualpNToAXrdMWssr_wHWgjafL", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/commentisfree", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Opinion | The Guardian", "title": "True stories of human suffering can change MPs\u2019 hearts.

The family-run Cornish firm is offering handmade Easter Eggs in three new flavours- each filled with a special treat inside. Each is lovingly made to create the perfect gift for the friend or family member who would love something different at Easter. The first is a fabulous Strawberry Bellini Easter Egg \u2013 a fruity, fizzy treat that tastes like your favourite cocktail. The white chocolate egg is infused with freeze-dried strawberry pieces and a little popping surprise. Inside, you\u2019ll find Buttermilk\u2019s new Strawberry Bellini Fudge \u2013 the perfect buttery, crumbly accompaniment to a glass of Prosecco and strawberries. Next up is a stunning Caramel Sea Salt Milk Chocolate Easter Egg. Inside the milk chocolate egg with butterscotch decoration, you\u2019ll find caramel sea salt fudge infused with tiny flakes of sea salt for a perfect burst of salt combined with caramel sweetness. Lastly, Buttermilk has launched a Dark Chocolate and Honeycomb Easter Egg. This Belgian dark chocolate egg is drizzled with white chocolate. Open up the two chocolate halves and inside, there\u2019s a melt-in-the-mouth honeycomb dipped in dark chocolate with real honey and a dash of sea salt. For a smaller but equally tasty treat, Buttermilk has taken Hot Cross buns for its inspiration and created a fantastic new crumbly fudge that really does taste like Easter. Buttermilk director, Tracy McDonnell Goad said: \u201cWe could not be more excited to launch our Easter range which is inspired by memories of traditional Easter eggs. With that in mind, we wanted to make a special treat that is filled with our delicious confectionery to create a truly memorable Easter Egg for children and adults alike without the disappointment of a hollow egg!\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for something that\u2019s a bit different and lovingly handmade here in Cornwall, then we definitely have something for you!\u201d All are gluten-free and cost \u00a311.99 each. The Hot Cross bun fudge costs \u00a32.99.

Does a \u2018Made in Britain\u2019 label make a difference to consumer brand perception? Attest, a brand intelligence and consumer insights platform, surveyed 2,000 British and 2,000 American people, and these are some of the findings: 3 in 4 people are more likely to buy a product with a \u2018Made in Britain\u2019 label \u2018Quality\u2019 is the most associated term with \u2018Made in Britain\u2019, followed by \u2018stylish\u2019, though 46% of people expect British-made products to be expensive 1 in 3 Americans admit they don\u2019t know any British brands However nearly 40% of Americans find \u2018Made in Britain\u2019 products \u2018desirable\u2019 39% of Brits feel more positively towards British brands and products post-Brexit When asked to list their favourite British brands, Cadbury and M&S had the best brand perception for British participants, while Burberry came out on top as the favourite in the US. View the full infographic here and additional assets on Dropbox \u201cBritain\u2019s reputation for style and quality, both within the UK and overseas, is evident in our findings\u201d, says Mark Walker, Marketing Director at Attest. \u201cRather than Brexit diminishing Britain\u2019s reputation for consumer brands on the world stage, it appears to be presenting an opportunity to redefine \u2018Made in Britain\u2019 both at home and abroad.\u201d John Noble, Director of the British Brands Group says: \u201cBritish brands are a strong source of pride, but also of our international competitiveness, and it is encouraging to see this reflected in this research. British brands help shape perceptions of the UK around the world, with the Nation Brand Index rating the country 3rd out of 50 for the strength of its image and reputation.

Whereas now, I just dictate my report and it is done instantly The Pathology Department at the Countess of Chester Hospital (CoCH), users of the TalkingPoint digital dictation solution throughout the Trust since 2009, has implemented the \u201cTalkingPoint for Pathology\u201d histopathology reporting speech recognition workflow solution. \u201cI think TalkingPoint with speech recognition is a great benefit \u2013 it has greatly improved my turnaround times. Before, if I dictated something, it may take the secretaries 24 hours to type it up. Whereas now, I just dictate my report and it is done instantly,\u201d comments Dr Jackie Elder, Consultant Histopathologist & Head of Cellular Pathology, Countess of Chester Hospital. Continues Jackie: \u201cWe have been working with TalkingPoint to look at the speech driven workflow primarily with histology reports, cytology reports and post mortem reports.\u201d Producing over 20,000 pathology reports a year, there are 7 TalkingPoint users in the Pathology Department at CoCH. The majority of the department\u2019s reports are now created using speech recognition with histology cases taking from 10 seconds to 2-3 minutes to dictate. Post mortem reports, depending on the complexity of the case, take from 4 mins to 15-20 minutes to dictate. Jackie adds: \u201cThe terminology used in post mortem reports is slightly different to histology reports \u2013 it is more like a story so you use \u2018normal English\u2019 as well as medical terms. The voice recognition is managing this well.\u201d The introduction of TalkingPoint\u2019s specialist histopathology reporting speech recognition workflow system at CoCH allows Pathologists to dictate reports, view and digitally sign the report off in real time. Since moving to TalkingPoint\u2019s speech solution, the secretarial team is managing the workload of typing the macro reports and digital dictations, with reduced backlogs.

It is shown that four water surroundings all could leach hazardous materials from the Ni-Cd batteries. The water with NaCl concentration of 66.7 mg L \u22121 had the highest leaching ability, the hazardous materials were leached after only approximately 50 days (average time, with a standard deviation of 4.1), while less than 100 days were needed in the others. An electrochemical corrosion is considered to be the main leaching mechanism leading to battery breakage, while the dissolution-deposition process and the powder route result in the leakage and transference of nickel and cadmium materials from the electrodes. The anions, i.e., SO 4 2\u2212 and Cl \u2212 , and dissolved oxygen in water were demonstrated to be the vital factors that influence the leaching processes. Thus, it is proposed that spent Ni-Cd batteries must be treated properly to avoid potential danger to the environment.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2AB29Mo", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:28.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2aa18fcc62d920cb7523559200f4e747e431dd6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSBiNNefID7kes9nSnHeud0T11DoXFS3UJxotTgpQ3COyMayDciV9yYbIqSJIAaHcM0nAQiuB4xDMW8OVsUVtaJF._2ihHGJMJJCnXJ_tKTDz_ZVW9idNx3GuVrpUIY8A44uuycvAmQ5inHrYArt4chvUNLk8ayxtE-", "site_full": "seshetscribe.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://seshetscribe.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Highly Intelligent New Generation Xiaomi Vacuum Cleaner App Control 5200mAh \u2013 Seshet", "title": "Highly Intelligent New Generation Xiaomi Vacuum Cleaner App Control 5200mAh", "title_full": "Highly Intelligent New Generation Xiaomi Vacuum Cleaner App Control 5200mAh", "published": "2017-12-07T12:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2aa18fcc62d920cb7523559200f4e747e431dd6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSBiNNefID7kes9nSnHeud0T11DoXFS3UJxotTgpQ3COyMayDciV9yYbIqSJIAaHcM0nAQiuB4xDMW8OVsUVtaJF._2ihHGJMJJCnXJ_tKTDz_ZVW9idNx3GuVrpUIY8A44uuycvAmQ5inHrYArt4chvUNLk8ayxtE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "seshetscribe", "published": "2017-12-07T12:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Highly Intelligent New Generation Xiaomi Vacuum Cleaner App Control 5200mAh", "text": "Highly Intelligent New Generation Xiaomi Vacuum Cleaner App Control 5200mAh \u2013 Buy \u2013 Highly Intelligent New Generation Xiaomi Vacuum Cleaner App Control 5200mAh ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:28.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2f8d979a0886b377a609a3547a67a27b5685edbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSlUPIzIvkVcHWiXiYHkhBed0nnClCyx9Dy77xs4jiLfVqpz79YtuZYRlCfhL.yNvF4_qT2bpfTgs1wVu42ZFKcqrsiEKbR84JxAHarJ8EGXTK90fiD9IHVaT6rEsVHoMogmORqf.rY2oGlnE8wUatghyucfG1v5Ms-", "site_full": "pressreleases.responsesource.com", "site": "responsesource.com", "site_section": "http://www.sourcewire.com/news/feeds/releases.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "SourceWire All Categories", "title": "GatedTalent becomes the fastest selling new product in Dillistone Group\u2019s history", "title_full": "GatedTalent becomes the fastest selling new product in Dillistone Group\u2019s history", "published": "2017-12-07T10:18:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2f8d979a0886b377a609a3547a67a27b5685edbc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSlUPIzIvkVcHWiXiYHkhBed0nnClCyx9Dy77xs4jiLfVqpz79YtuZYRlCfhL.yNvF4_qT2bpfTgs1wVu42ZFKcqrsiEKbR84JxAHarJ8EGXTK90fiD9IHVaT6rEsVHoMogmORqf.rY2oGlnE8wUatghyucfG1v5Ms-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:18:00.000+02:00", "title": "GatedTalent becomes the fastest selling new product in Dillistone Group\u2019s history", "text": "GatedTalent becomes the fastest selling new product in Dillistone Group\u2019s history Thursday 7 December 2017 PDF Print GatedTalent, which was launched in October 2017, to allow executives to share information with recruiters in a private manner while also assisting recruiters in their GDPR compliance, has become the fastest selling new product in the Dillistone Group\u2019s history. The GatedTalent platform enables executives to ensure their data is always up to date and can only be shared with recruiters of their choice. This change of emphasis gives both executives and recruiters unparalleled confidence in the quality of the network. With initial demand for the platform driven by GDPR compliance, the company is pleased to report that by the end of November, contracts had been received from firms in more than a dozen countries across the European continent. Pleasingly, a number of additional contracts have been won with businesses based outside of the EU who see the value in the new portal as a way of increasing engagement with candidates. In the UK alone, contracts have now been signed with more than 20 firms with clients including generalist executive search firms along with boutiques in niches as diverse as Board Search, Financial Services, Technology and Pharmaceuticals. Clients on the platform will essentially be sending invitations to senior level executives, inviting them to join the GatedTalent network . Many of the early adopters operate internationally, meaning that invitations can be expected to be sent to a truly global executive pool. The platform has already received registrations from executives based in Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East and both North and South America. While revenue in 2018 will largely be generated by Search firm subscriptions, longer term financial performance of the business will be derived from the size and quality of the executive database. In planning for the platform, the Board anticipated that its clients would send in excess of 1,000,000 invitations to executives by March 2018 and that a certain percentage of these would create profiles. Based on the volume, nature and expected usage of the firms that have signed, or are expected to sign to implement the platform, the Board is increasingly confident that it will achieve and very significantly beat this target. It remains too early to estimate the conversion rate of invitations to profiles. The Board is also pleased to note that GatedTalent clients include firms that are currently using the Dillistone Systems\u2019 FileFinder Anywhere platform; firms on legacy versions of FileFinder who will be upgrading to the latest version of the platform; and firms that have not previously been clients of the Group and will be adopting FileFinder alongside GatedTalent. Jason Starr, CEO of Dillistone Group Plc, said \u2013 \u201cWe are delighted that so many of our clients see GatedTalent in the way that we do \u2013 as a way to convert the challenges of GDPR into an opportunity to increase engagement with candidates. We are well on our way to building the World\u2019s largest private executive network of this type and are increasingly confident that GatedTalent will be transformational for the global executive search industry and for our Group.\u201d ENDS This press release was distributed by ResponseSource Press Release Wire on behalf of BlueSky Public Relations Ltd in the following categories: Business & Finance , Education & Human Resources , for more information visit https://pressreleasewire.responsesource.com/about .

The composites were used for the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solution. The results indicated that MIL-100(Fe) and GO formed a sandwich-like structure, and the crystal structure of MIL-100(Fe) was reserved in the composites. The attachment of GO layers to the MIL-100(Fe) decreased the surface area from 1690 to 1602 m 2 /g, and pore volume from 0.996 to 0.770 cm 3 /g when 5% ( w / w ) GO was added, due to the coating of MIL-100(Fe) by GO sheets. The addition of 5% ( w / w ) GO increased the adsorption capacity for MB (from 1019 to 1231 mg/g) and MO (from 667 to 1189 mg/g). The composites showed a better thermal stability than MIL-100(Fe); the decomposition temperature increased from 280 to 350 \u00b0C. The addition of GO improved the properties of MIL-100(Fe) as an adsorbent for MO/MB from aqueous solution.\n\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2jnNJpJ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:28.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "55738ce8ca6aa65fb170625dd75df8b7ffbd62b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nZOCJivZzescL.JpS5yLU1ZQBoeYJpx.YWDCd3IBibkv_G_U5Fa82iyGZvZeHZPrGYb7374ala13R3TTAmMC9LZxkDZRya382HuCUBpvualpNToAXrdMWssr_wHWgjafL", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/commentisfree", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Opinion | The Guardian", "title": "True stories of human suffering can change MPs\u2019 hearts.

The upper Columbia River is highly contaminated with heavy metal wastes from nearby smelting operations in Trail, British Columbia, Canada, and to a lesser extent, Northport (Le Roi smelter), Washington, USA. Airborne emissions from the Trail operations were historically and are currently transported by prevailing winds down the Columbia River canyon, where particulate metals can be deposited into lakes and watersheds. In lakes, sediment cores contain records of past environmental conditions, providing a timeline of fundamental chemical and biological relationships within aquatic ecosystems, including records of airborne metal depositions. We analyzed trace metal concentrations (Ni, Cd, Zn, As, Cu, Sb, Pb, Hg) and Pb isotope compositions of sediment cores from six remote eastern Washington lakes to assess potential sources of atmospheric heavy metal deposition. Sediment cores displayed evidence to support trace metal loading as a direct consequence of smelting operations in Trail. Smelter contamination was detected 144 km downwind of the Trail Smelter.

illegally over Indonesia\u2019s eastern waters. \nOn board the ship were six flags of different countries suspected to have been used by the crew to deceive patrol officers. \n\u201cWhen we seized the ship, the crew erected the Timor-Leste flag, but when the officers checked the ships, there were five other flags,\u201d said Maritime Affairs and Fisheries minister Susi Pudjiastuti during a press conference in Jakarta on Monday as reported by kompas.co.id. \nThe other flags found on board were those of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore. \nThe 21 crew members comprised nine Chinese, six Indonesians, three Myanmarese and three Vietnamese, said Susi, adding that it was suspected that the ship operated over Indonesian waters since August. \nLocal authorities also seized 35 tonnes of fish, including tiger sharks, a protected species, she added. \u201cWe have taken the ship to Kupang Port [in East Nusa Tenggara] for further investigation,\u201d she said. \nPreviously, Timor-Leste maritime officials arrested 15 different Fu Yuan Yu ships. \nThe governments of Indonesia and Timor-Leste are coordinating to jointly investigate the incident.",

Now the pause on the production is extending into the new year. \nNetflix is already a huge buyer of programming, and it\u2019s jacking up the content budget for 2018 \u2014 projecting it will spend between $7 billion and $8 billion, up from $6 billion this year. The streamer\u2019s content slate for next year includes around 80 original films through productions or acquisitions, Sarandos reiterated Monday, which he\u2019d told investors on Netflix\u2019s earnings call in October. One-third of all viewing on Netflix is of movies, he said. \nClick here to read more. \nSOURCE: Variety, Todd Spangler ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robin wright", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claire underwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank underwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin spacey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ted sarandos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarandos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wright", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spacey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "todd spangler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "black christian news network \u2018house of cards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global media and communications conference", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "media rights capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of cards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baltimore", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:30.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e17b11fbb1766e6d0a7df34856187e5af85b12c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaENWAQqlCJPM1RdH.bSF4Q7Q3T0ToycTWIr4DJ1.cb4MzZWa6M4gLzVrl8.pSe7dbNzFBDN6P3r9ruy1QH8APp5raWJRVsRno", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/San-Diego-Hoteis.d178304.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Condado de San Diego: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "Town and Country San Diego:", "title_full": "Town and Country San Diego: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-11-01T21:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0c00a1e5b57d6f9d95a9fb9f1f0a199d48fd3f2d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaENWAQqlCJPM1RdH.bSF4Q7Q3T0ToycTWIr4DJ1.cb4MzZWa6M4gLzVrl8.pSe7dbNzFBDN6P3r9ruy1QH8APp.B6Rved5SIKl.x3T13ISNH_phZmsqmz_M4zrg1bmLja", "ord_in_thread": 17, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-03T00:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Special rate to Expedia does suggest that there will be a resort fee, but does not inform you about the $20 parking fee.

BF was fractionated by reversed-phase polyamide column chromatography, obtaining 34 subfractions, which were subjected to HSCCC, where patuletin and patulitrin were isolated. CAE and the fractions BF, EAF, DF, and AQF were analyzed by LC-DAD-MS, and patuletin and patulitrin were determined as the major substances in EAF and BF, respectively. BF was also analyzed by HPLC and capillary electrophoresis (CE), and patulitrin was again determined to be the main substance in this fraction. CAE and the semipurified fractions (750, 500, 300, 100, and 50\u2009mg/L) were assayed for larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti, with mortality rate expressed as percentage. All fractions except AQF showed insecticidal activity after 24\u2009h exposure of larvae to the highest concentration. However, EAF showed the highest activity with more than 50% reduction in larval population at 50\u2009mg/L.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) prev next Donald Trump Jr. refused to tell lawmakers about conversations he had with his father regarding a 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer after emails detailing the meeting had become public, according to the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee.\nSpeaking to the committee behind closed doors on Wednesday as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, Trump Jr. said he didn't tell the president about the meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russians when it happened and he declined to elaborate on what he ultimately told him after the meeting became public.\nCalifornia Rep. Adam Schiff said that Trump Jr. said he couldn't speak about the conversations with his father this summer because of attorney-client privilege, telling the committee a lawyer was present when he spoke to his father about the June 2016 meeting and the emails that led up to it.\nSchiff said that wasn't a valid excuse not to talk, saying \"the presence of counsel does not mean communications between father and son are privileged.\"\nThe Trump Tower meeting is a matter of keen interest to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is also investigating the meddling and whether there was any obstruction of justice. Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, attended the meeting with several Russian operatives under the impression that they might receive damaging information about the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton.\nMueller is also interested in the White House response to the meeting once it became public. The White House has said the president was involved in drafting an early statement saying the meeting primarily concerned a Russian adoption program, but emails later released by Trump Jr. showed he enthusiastically agreed to the sit-down with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others after he was promised dirt on his father's rival. Trump Jr. later said the promised material never materialized.\nTrump Jr. said during Wednesday's eight-hour interview that he spoke with President Donald Trump's communications aide Hope Hicks as early reports of the meeting emerged, according to one person familiar with the interview. The New York Times was first to report the existence of the meeting last July, and Trump Jr. released the emails detailing the planning for it several days later.\nHicks was with the president on Air Force One while they were writing the initial statement that said the meeting primarily concerned the adoption program.\nTrump Jr. also told the intelligence panel that he didn't tell his father about the 2016 meeting at the time that it happened, according to the person familiar with his interview. The person was not authorized to speak about the testimony and asked not to be identified.\nBoth the House and the Senate intelligence committees have been interested in the Trump Tower meeting and have interviewed several participants. The Senate Judiciary Committee is also investigating the meeting, and interviewed Trump Jr. behind closed doors in September.\nIn that interview, Trump Jr. cast the 2016 meeting as simply an opportunity to learn about Clinton's \"fitness, character or qualifications,\" insisting to investigators that he did not collude with Russia to hurt Clinton's campaign.\nThe Senate intelligence committee also hopes to interview Trump Jr. before the end of the year.\nKushner has spoken to both intelligence committees. The panels have also interviewed Ike Kaveladze, who was at the meeting as a representative of a Russian developer who once partnered with Trump to bring the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow, and Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist. A translator who was in attendance has also spoken to congressional investigators.\nLawmakers were also expected to ask Trump Jr. about his communications with WikiLeaks during and after the campaign. Trump Jr. released messages last month that showed him responding to the WikiLeaks' Twitter account three times, at one point agreeing to \"ask around\" about a political action committee WikiLeaks had mentioned. He also asked the site about a rumor about an upcoming leak, and tweeted a link that the account sent him.\nAlso Wednesday, the House intelligence panel released a transcript of an interview last week with Erik Prince, the founder of the security firm Blackwater and a prominent Trump supporter.\nAccording to the transcript, which was partially redacted, Prince told the panel he met a Russian with ties to President Vladimir Putin in the Seychelles islands earlier this year, but he denies he was representing Trump in the exchange.\nPrince said he and Kirill Dmitriev of the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund had a 30-minute conversation in a hotel bar Jan. 11 and discussed oil and commodity prices and how Dmitriev wished the two countries' trade relationship would improve. The meeting has captured the interest of investigators since an April report in The Washington Post that it was an attempt to establish a back-channel line of communication between Trump and Putin.\nPrince denied that assertion in the interview. He also suggested intelligence officials in former President Barack Obama's administration leaked details of the meeting.\nThough the intelligence committee does not generally release transcripts of interviews, lawmakers agreed to do so in negotiations with Prince.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump jr.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ike kaveladze", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trey gowdy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean hannity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackie speier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirill dmitriev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prince", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rinat akhmetshin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam schiff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmitriev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott applewhite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hope hicks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hicks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik prince", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schiff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "natalia veselnitskaya", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blackwater", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wikileaks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox news channel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house intelligence committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house permanent select committee on intelligence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seychelles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d-calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump tower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:30.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e17b11fbb1766e6d0a7df34856187e5af85b12c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaENWAQqlCJPM1RdH.bSF4Q7Q3T0ToycTWIr4DJ1.cb4MzZWa6M4gLzVrl8.pSe7dbNzFBDN6P3r9ruy1QH8APp5raWJRVsRno", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/San-Diego-Hoteis.d178304.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Condado de San Diego: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "Town and Country San Diego:", "title_full": "Town and Country San Diego: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2017-11-01T21:28:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "723ac54cdf10f1b34b5dc5233dae03bc229ec98a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaENWAQqlCJPM1RdH.bSF4Q7Q3T0ToycTWIr4DJ1.cb4MzZWa6M4gLzVrl8.pSe7dbNzFBDN6P3r9ruy1QH8APp4doIJdJc.D7K7_vmET_zsCYOlSYlp7r_K545w1R560N", "ord_in_thread": 15, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-27T04:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "T&C hosts a great traditional jazz festival over the Thanksgiving weekend.

Barnett, Mellissa Prunty, Sara Rosenblum\nBackgroundDemands for the production of legible handwriting produced in a timely manner increase as children progress through school. Despite the considerable number of children faced with handwriting difficulties, there is no quick and practical tool to assess legibility in this population.AimThe aim of this study was to develop the Handwriting Legibility Scale (HLS) and to establish the scale\u2019s reliability and validity.MethodsThe HLS is a non-language dependent scale which assesses global legibility, based on five criteria applied to samples of \u2018free writing\u2019. Content validity, inter-rater reliability and internal consistency were initially examined using scripts from 20 children aged 8\u201314 years. Construct validity was established by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of data from 150 school children aged 9\u201314 years, with an additional examination of gender effects. Discriminant validity of the HLS score was examined in 29 children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and 29 typically developing (TD) children.ResultsThe results indicated high internal consistency (\u03b1=0.92). The inter-rater reliability was acceptable but indicates the need to refine the scoring instructions. PCA of the five components revealed a one factor solution explaining 61% of the variance. In the discriminant analysis, 86.2% of the children with DCD and 89.7% of the TD children were correctly classified to their groups based on the total HLS score.ConclusionsThe overall findings suggest that the HLS may be a useful tool to identify poor handwriting legibility, with application across different languages and writing scripts.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2k1PQ1U", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anna l. barnett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mellissa prunty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sara rosenblum backgrounddemands", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dcd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "principal component analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pca", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:31.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5540ecb83bb76ed0b366abee92092be27045f51c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95igUEtysHXxG188ebw3U1PXpZIegacm7XuqLOswbaUXImMT02jOjn26L28J_EbYIUGYAc41kSKJ85w--", "site_full": "www.newsday.co.zw", "site": "newsday.co.zw", "site_section": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NewsDay Zimbabwe", "title": "Apple\u2019s Cook optimistic that apps pulled in China will be back", "title_full": "Apple\u2019s Cook optimistic that apps pulled in China will be back", "published": "2017-12-07T05:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZW", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Social-Media-in-the-Workplace.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 74625, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5540ecb83bb76ed0b366abee92092be27045f51c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95igUEtysHXxG188ebw3U1PXpZIegacm7XuqLOswbaUXImMT02jOjn26L28J_EbYIUGYAc41kSKJ85w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsday", "published": "2017-12-07T05:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "Apple\u2019s Cook optimistic that apps pulled in China will be back", "text": "Apple\u2019s Cook optimistic that apps pulled in China will be back - December 7, 2017 \nHONG KONG \u2014 Apple Inc is optimistic that some of its popular apps removed from its China App Store this year to comply with government requests will be reinstated, the US tech giant\u2019s chief executive Tim Cook said yesterday. Reuters \nCook, speaking at the Fortune Forum in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, also stressed that he believes strongly in freedoms, a comment seen by many as a response to a US democratic senator\u2019s remarks on Tuesday that Apple had a moral obligation to promote free expression. \nApple is facing criticism from local users and rights groups for bowing to pressure from Beijing cyber regulators after it decided to remove dozens of apps from its Chinese store this year, including messaging apps and virtual private network (VPN) services, which help users subvert China\u2019s Great Firewall. \n\u201cMy hope over time is that some of the things, the couple of things that\u2019s been pulled, come back. I have great hope on that and great optimism on that,\u201d Cook said, adding that he always tries to find areas to work together and if he gets criticised for that, so be it. \nApp stores run by Apple and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google generate billions of dollars in revenue globally for them and China is a key target market as its users rely heavily on their phones for daily tasks ranging from grocery shopping to booking nail appointments. \nCook said he couldn\u2019t be happier with how the iPhone X is doing in China, Apple\u2019s third-largest region by sales although it has lost market share there in recent years as high-end handsets from local rivals continue to gain traction. \nTencent Holdings, China\u2019s biggest social network and gaming company, was a great partner, Cook said, adding that he thinks very highly of its founder, Pony Ma. \nApple and Tencent had a spat earlier this year after Tencent launched mini programs on its WeChat app, which created an ecosystem of apps within the app and threatened to become an operating system of its own. \nThe two companies are seen to have made peace recently, with the Apple China App Store starting to accept WeChat payments from late August. \nMany of the top games on Apple\u2019s China App Store are made by Tencent, which creates value for both firms.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tim cook", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortune forum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alphabet inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tencent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vpn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters  cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tencent holdings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple china app store", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china app store", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guangzhou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T12:08:31.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2acc214a741b6b962f11da8abeb27f529cd61aed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95ig9TcO_kTLbs0Sa5GO34jX6SzQZklE7aPA-", "site_full": "www.newsday.co.zw", "site": "newsday.co.zw", "site_section": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NewsDay Zimbabwe", "title": "Review by-laws: Vendors", "title_full": "Review by-laws: Vendors", "published": "2017-12-07T04:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZW", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Vendors-are-back-in-the-streets-as-seen-by-these-women-selling-their-goods-along-Chinoyi-street-yesterday-Pic-Shepherd-Tozvireva-2-e1507656348153.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 74625, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2acc214a741b6b962f11da8abeb27f529cd61aed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC_FbjDoEVzxvPkChCZu95ig9TcO_kTLbs0Sa5GO34jX6SzQZklE7aPA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsday", "published": "2017-12-07T04:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "Review by-laws: Vendors", "text": "Review by-laws: Vendors -
