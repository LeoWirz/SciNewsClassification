and navigation menu to allow 'in context access' to help articles and how-to video tutorials. The new search feature enables users to search for specific terms and advanced topics. \nThe ability to 'drill-down' into the data has been added to the Workware Performance Review report, providing interactive charts and graphs on team and individual performance and allowing users to explore the detail behind the summary data. \nAbout ActiveOps \nActiveOps - Manage Differently\u200b \nSince 2005, ActiveOps has been committed to helping organisations improve their operational efficiency by helping managers and teams deliver their best possible performance.

days ago 152 Views \nLarge size womens\u2019 shoes means you have less stock at stores and not available easily. Below are some facts about it: \n\u2022 In 1986 12% of American women had shoes sizes of 9.5 and higher. In 1994 that number increased to 17%. \u2022 In 1998 30.4% of all womens\u2019 shoes sold were size 9 and above. \u2022 The American Academy of Orthopedic surgeons, 8 out of 10 women wear shoes that are too small for them. \u2022 A sample survey conducted in the US showed that quite astonishingly, 60% of women\u2019s feet increased in shoe size since the age of 20. \u2022 It is in fact becoming more \u2018the norm\u2019 to have larger feet. \u2022 In the sixties, having a UK size 5 [US 6.5] was considered average and having a size 7 [US 9] or above and you had very large feet! \u2022 Up until the last couple of years, larger sized womens\u2019 shoes were often difficult to find, plain and frankly unfashionable. \u2022 More and more manufacturers and shoe designers now offer their styles in larger sizes as standard. \nBenefits Buying Online \n\u2022 Choosing large size womens\u2019 shoes online is relatively simple once you know the top stores to shop in. \u2022 If you went out shopping and looked around for larger sized shoes you might find the odd store who stocked them. \u2022 You certainly couldn\u2019t always look in a store window and know they would have anywhere near the size you wanted. \u2022 As well as taking away the hassle of trawling the stores, shopping online usually means a discounted price, often free shipping and lots and lots of variety.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "american academy of orthopedic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:08.092+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6abead98cd627d8d1ca1ee6055402224d8a9e247", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoHaqJLsnHHwvYVKkmi3ik_gdgbbAn_JfebBMvEBqGPwXo7JxS2O6VVAcnfo8D90zjsWFm7Q47D9V8YOEqLbzFDY_Kq5JXttdYQpvrust80dA--", "site_full": "baltimorejewishlife.com", "site": "baltimorejewishlife.com", "site_section": "http://baltimorejewishlife.com/news/localNews.php", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Baltimore Jewish Life | Local News", "title": "Parshas VaYeishev - What Really Counts?", "title_full": "Baltimore Jewish Life | Parshas VaYeishev - What Really Counts?", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.035, "main_image": "http://baltimorejewishlife.com/admin/articleFeature/2017120615125754633453.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6abead98cd627d8d1ca1ee6055402224d8a9e247", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoHaqJLsnHHwvYVKkmi3ik_gdgbbAn_JfebBMvEBqGPwXo7JxS2O6VVAcnfo8D90zjsWFm7Q47D9V8YOEqLbzFDY_Kq5JXttdYQpvrust80dA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BJLife/Rabbi Binyamin Zedner", "published": "2017-12-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Parshas VaYeishev - What Really Counts?", "text": "This week's Parshah opens \u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05b5\u05a3\u05e9\u05c1\u05b6\u05d1 \u05d9\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05e7\u05b9\u0594\u05d1 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b0\u05d0\u05b6\u0596\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05de\u05b0\u05d2\u05d5\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05a3\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b4\u0591\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b0\u05d0\u05b6\u0596\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05db\u05bc\u05b0\u05e0\u05b8\u05bd\u05e2\u05b7\u05df\u05c3 And Yaakov settled in the land where his father had sojourned, the land of Canaan.\nOur sages teach us that Yaakov's problems with Yosef began after this because he \u201csettled\u201d in this world. Yaakov thought he was done with all his trials and tribulations in life and now he could settle and enjoy the rest of his life in peace. This was a false notion because one must always grow in life and cannot stagnate. When one stagnates he automatically goes down. Picture a fish, when you see if flowing downstream you know it is dead, but a live fish will have to swim forward even to remain in the same spot. As the popular saying goes \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d.\nThe Midrash says a similarl story. A student of the holy Rav Shimon Bar Yochai left Israel to make some money. When he came back later as a rich man, all the other students got a little envious. They too wanted to be rich. If they had money they can study Torah in peace! When Rav Shimon Bar Yochai saw this he told his students follow me. He went to a valley and made it fill with gold coins (you know cool kabbalistic stuff). He then told his students, save yourselves the time, just take the money from here. They said Rabbi, what's the fine print? Rav Shimon responded that any gold you take from here comes off your world to come.\nBut why is this true? Why if no pain, no gain? Why does the gold here take away from my gold there? Let me enjoy my life and grow and have Olam Haba too! The answer comes from last week's Parshah. Yaakov told Esav \u05d9\u05e9 \u05dc\u05d9 \u05db\u05dc, I have everything that I need. Everything that I need Hashem provided even if it seems like a little. If I want more than what I have I think I know better than Hashem. And if we \u201cforce\u201d Hashem to give it to us it causes more harm than good.\nWhen Yaakov was originally escaping from Esav and was on his way to Lavan, Esav sent his son, Elifaz, to kill Yaakov. Yaakov convinced Esav\u2019s son not to kill him but instead to take all his money because a pauper is like a dead man walking. But how did this work? Esav said kill not rob? The answer is that Elifaz was only doing what Esav taught him, money is everything, so when Yaakov told Elifaz take my money, Elifaz agreed that a pauper is like a dead person and he learned that from none other than Esav. But still that shouldn't have been enough. Esav said kill! Our sages say this is because Elifaz grew up on Yitzhak\u2019s lap and that had an effect on him.

But, seeing potential benefits of CBDs, the American Veterinary Medical Association's policy-making body said last summer it wants the DEA to declassify marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug \"to facilitate research opportunities for veterinary and human medical uses.\" It asked the board of the national veterinarians' organization to investigate working with other stakeholders toward that goal. The board is awaiting a recommendation from two group councils. \"The concern our membership has is worry about people extrapolating their own dosages, looking to medicate their pets outside the realm of the medical professional,\" Board Chairman Michael Whitehair said in a telephone interview. \"This is an important reason for us to continue the research.\" Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a conservative Republican, became an unlikely champion of this push when he introduced a bill in September that would open the path for more clinical research. While Hatch said he opposes recreational marijuana use, he wants marijuana-based drugs, regulated by the FDA, produced for people with disorders. \"We lack the science to support use of medical marijuana products like CBD oils, not because researchers are unwilling to do the work, but because of bureaucratic red tape and over-regulation,\" Hatch said. Dawn Boothe, of Auburn University's College of Veterinary Medicine, is waiting for federal approval to begin a study of marijuana's effects on dogs with epilepsy. The classification of marijuana products containing CBD as a Schedule 1 drug, the same category as heroin and LSD, creates a \"major, major, major, terrible roadblock\" for researchers, Boothe said in a phone interview. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine were studying CBDs' effects on dogs with osteoarthritis and pruritis, or itchiness, until the DEA released its policy statement. \"The ambiguity in this process has really brought us to a screeching halt,\" said Michael DiGregorio, director of the university's clinical trials center. \"It is research that needs to be done, because there are a lot of CBD products out there.\" When it clarified that marijuana CBD extracts are Schedule 1 drugs, the DEA said it was assigning a code number to those substances to better track them and to comply with international drug control treaties. DiGregorio complained that researchers seeking federal approval to study CBD products are told to provide certain data, but that data isn't normally available until the study is done. \"If you don't have the data, you can't get the registration to do the work,\" he said. On a recent morning, Maas took a break from seeing four-legged patients in the Bend Veterinary Clinic. A stethoscope dangling from his neck over green scrubs, Maas said his clients have reported CBDs help relieve pain, arthritis, anxiety, loss of appetite, epilepsy and inflammation in their pets. \"Unfortunately there's not a lot of research out there, especially on animals, on CBD compounds,\" Maas said. \"The research is really necessary to help us understand how to actually use these compounds on our pets.\" Veterinarian Janet Ladyga of the Blue Sky Veterinary Clinic, also in Bend, said she doesn't recommend marijuana products because of the unknowns. \"We don't have a lot of evidence right now, so we don't know the toxicity or the safety profile ... and we don't have any good evidence to show either if it's safe or efficacious,\" she said. The study at Colorado State University aims to provide some data. The roughly two dozen dogs in the arthritis study and the 30 in the epilepsy tests are given either CBD oil or a placebo. For the arthritis study, activity monitors are attached to the animals' collars, to determine if they're more mobile when they're taking CBD. Principal investigator Stephanie McGrath said she hopes the results will be a stepping stone for longer and more diverse studies, and that they provide useful information for human medicine. \"Every medication we're taking has been given to a dog first,\" the University of Pennsylvania's DiGregorio noted. Meanwhile, Boothe said she had everything ready to start her study in January, and was waiting for a green light from federal officials. \"I don't know what's taking so long,\" she said. ___ Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky Most Popular", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "luke byerly", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dawn boothe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew selsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelsie condon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet ladyga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "byerly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robbie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael whitehair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael digregorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcgrath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie mcgrath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orrin hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digregorio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david zalubowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boothe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "american veterinary medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blue sky veterinary clinic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auburn university's college of veterinary medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania school of veterinary medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap image", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado state university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:09.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ffdd1f4c03f98b8f38ba3fae745278395aca854", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVp.DKH4T0GljUM2yhGVPZplgwPo7Zi6Ga8GIcs4wv1JCgmED2JhaqVW5Zafxoa06buz7ipvFk3eqQzBN.zAyiQ4GEb8sx8l6Sui3zrdZJ4k7CCtq8xdZH.", "site_full": "news.bestnaira.com", "site": "bestnaira.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/bestnaira/BTbw", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest News in Nigeria", "title": "Delta govt committed to compliance with FOI Act \u2014Ukah", "title_full": "Delta govt committed to compliance with FOI Act \u2014Ukah", "published": "2017-12-07T01:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8ffdd1f4c03f98b8f38ba3fae745278395aca854", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVp.DKH4T0GljUM2yhGVPZplgwPo7Zi6Ga8GIcs4wv1JCgmED2JhaqVW5Zafxoa06buz7ipvFk3eqQzBN.zAyiQ4GEb8sx8l6Sui3zrdZJ4k7CCtq8xdZH.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "BestNaira", "published": "2017-12-07T01:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Delta govt committed to compliance with FOI Act \u2014Ukah", "text": "Thu Dec 7th, 2017 - Delta \nBy Festus Ahon & Ochuko Akuopha \nD ELTA State Commissioner for Information, Mr. Patrick Ukah, has reiterated the commitment of the state government to comply with the Freedom of Information, FOI, Act.

As per an ICRA note, after considering the increasing content per vehicle due to various technological advancement as well as regulatory measures (emission, safety regulations), the growth in the auto component industry will be relatively higher than the underlying growth in the automotive industry in the medium to long term.\nICRA\u0092s sample of 48 auto ancillaries, constituting around 25% of the industry\u0092s turnover, witnessed revenue growth of about 13.5% (revenue) during Q2 FY2018e. The same was driven by higher realization in the backdrop of steady increase in commodity prices, whereas volumetric growth was in the mid-single digit. Overall, during H1FY2018, the sample space grew by 9.5% which is in line with 9%-11% growth estimate for FY2018.\nSays Mr. Subrata Ray, Senior Vice President and Group Head, Corporate Sector ratings, ICRA, \u0093 Domestic original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), especially 2W and PV industry which together constitute about two-third of overall domestic OEM demand is expected to grow at a healthy pace in FY2018. Moreover, expected recovery in rural income will provide upside for sub-segments like light commercial vehicles (LCVs), motorcycles and tractors. Though PV exports indicate some aberration and thereby has some bearing on production volumes, domestic PV demand remains strong during Q2FY2018. Exports related aberration is likely to abate during coming quarters and will be more than offset by robust domestic demand. As regards medium & heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCVs), their Q1FY2018 demand slowdown affected ancillaries\u0092 performance, but strong double digit growth during Q2FY2018 has resulted in superior performance of ancillaries. Going forward, pickup in infrastructure activity will further drive growth in construction & mining equipment as well as the tipper segment (classified under M&HCVs).\u0094\nExports which accounts for 28% of industry\u0092s demand, with USA and Europe making up for 60%, witnessed a decline. This was sharper in the US M&HCV market during H2 CY2015 and CY2016. However the trend seems somewhat reversed now with incremental order inflow for class-8 trucks being encouraging over the last six months. As for European markets, new PV and CV registration numbers have witnessed marginal growth YTD CY2017 and their growth outlook remains tepid over the near to medium term. Exports will also be affected by rupee appreciation.\nCommodity prices have been rising over the last 4-5 quarters, thereby pressurising industry\u0092s profitability. Amongst all ancillaries, tyre manufacturers were the worst impacted due to sharp volatility in rubber prices which has peaked around Rs 160/Kg in Q4FY2017, though it subsequently moderated to around Rs 130/Kg level at present. Easing rubber prices has helped operating margins to recover during Q2FY2018 after a five year low level during Q1FY2018. Other commodities like steel and lead also remained at elevated level and continued to pressurize profitability of players. Nevertheless, strong revenue growth during Q2FY2018 has offset some impact of commodity price pressure. Though overall OPM continues to remain lower than last year\u0092s level, most auto ancillaries have witnessed sequential improvement in operating margins.\nICRA expects industry-wide credit profile trends to remain stable, supported by robust demand from the OEM segment in the near term. Supported by healthy cash accruals, gearing as well as coverage indicators for the industry have improved considerably over the past two years. However given surplus capacities, the industry has been on a consolidation mode over the last two years, taking steps towards deleveraging their balance sheet. With select OEMs exploring inorganic growth opportunities in India as well as in overseas market to support growth, as well as to diversify its clientele and product portfolio, some incremental leverage may be expected. Overall ancillaries are concentrated on moving up the value chain to mitigate profitability and competitive pressure in the intensely competitive industry.\nIncremental investments by auto ancillaries are primarily towards new order/platform related requirement or debottlenecking of existing capacity. Few have started investing keeping in mind the requirements for BS VI (in 2020), CAFE norms and electric vehicles in 2030.\n\u0093 Over the medium to long term, growth in the auto component industry will be higher than the underlying automotive industry growth, given the increasing localisation by OEMs, higher component content per vehicle and rising exports from India. In line with ICRA\u0092s previous forecast, OPMs dipped below 15% level during FY2017 and it is likely to moderate further in FY2018. Nevertheless we maintain our medium term margin outlook of ~13%13.5% as compared to earlier sub-12% level witnessed prior to FY2012 owing to a richer product mix and rising revenues from the profitable aftermarket segment. We maintain our 10-12% long term (5 year) CAGR expectation for Indian auto component industry,\u0094 concludes Mr. Ray.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:09.073+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6f851f5687df2f1c0149890e070fcd0c45436872", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS76VDaDFrrEZfSg47lFq8qPXBVcIHVr9Y8Vhh_35NwoGBPRvTqfnUlErni7_tBe1DhyIEvlTXWfs9fPSl3ikFk1ouj8hlo0JUzBQEHkhyZ9W3V.zrn9TepodWErlCKHoSNScC_GQwDm4Kh6dcbGhan9MYhR8lxGs.IdN2vBUhn9g--", "site_full": "www.prnewswire.com", "site": "prnewswire.com", "site_section": "http://rss.prnewswire.com/industry/crl/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "PR Newswire:", "title": "Orthoconnections Celebrate Successful First Month of Trading on New Website", "title_full": "Orthoconnections Celebrate Successful First Month of Trading on New Website", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/616303/Orthoconnections_Logo.jpg?p=facebook", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3190, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6f851f5687df2f1c0149890e070fcd0c45436872", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS76VDaDFrrEZfSg47lFq8qPXBVcIHVr9Y8Vhh_35NwoGBPRvTqfnUlErni7_tBe1DhyIEvlTXWfs9fPSl3ikFk1ouj8hlo0JUzBQEHkhyZ9W3V.zrn9TepodWErlCKHoSNScC_GQwDm4Kh6dcbGhan9MYhR8lxGs.IdN2vBUhn9g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Orthoconnections", "published": "2017-12-07T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Orthoconnections Celebrate Successful First Month of Trading on New Website", "text": "Orthoconnections Celebrate Successful First Month of Trading on New Website News provided by Share this article \nREADING, England , December 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- \nOrthoconnections are celebrating a successful first month of business on their brand new website, an online platform dedicated to connecting orthopaedic distributors with manufacturers. \nSince its launch, the company has seen a significant increase in visitors and online activity. \nCompany director, Matt Woods , commented: \n\"Over the last two years we have listened carefully to feedback from Orthoconnections' members and developed the website and the services we offer accordingly.

CEO Mark Stogdill has been awarded the accolade of Best CEO- Telecommunications Industry, USA in this year's line-up.\nThe ever evolving world of tech and communications is hard for the average business leader to keep up with, but not so for Hammer Fiber's President. Mark Stogdill is firmly at the cutting edge of technology and launched the company himself in just 2014. Prior to taking the helm he'd already enjoyed a successful career in the telecoms industry, so was perfectly placed to set up a brand new and forward thinking organisation that would see him gaining worldwide recognition as an industry pioneer.\nIt's hard to remember a time when we weren't connected by the internet- it's become such an intrinsic part of our daily lives. Since the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) we've seen even more changes that have revolutionised the way businesses (and our personal lives) work, but there's still a significant part of the US where internet connections are far from perfect. Hammer Fiber was born out of Mark's desire to give everyone access to super-fast, reliable broadband no matter how remote their location- and he's achieved great success in just three years.\nThe company has recently joined forces with Go Long Wireless Ltd, a Florida based company that specialises in multichannel video distribution and data services. This meeting of two powerful and innovative organisations will target areas with lacklustre broadband, TV and internet phone services to bring enhanced communication and entertainment to residential and commercial customers.\nMark Stogdill puts his success down to his team of highly engaged employees, and team building and worker satisfaction is high on the company's agenda. \"The internet is a people business and delivering on our promises takes great people, from our esteemed Board of Directors down to our service technicians. Hammer's success is a team effort,\" he told our reporter.\nTo read more about Hammer Fiber visit http://www.hammerfiber.biz/ \nAn article on the company can also be found on BWM website\nhttps://www.bwmonline.com/2017/12/03/hammer-fiber-attack-the-digital-divide/ \nAbout Business Worldwide Magazine \nBusiness Worldwide Magazine is the leading source of business and dealmaker intelligence throughout the world.

Digitising supply chains with modular platforms like AX for Pharma can help pharmaceutical companies improve their operational performance, explains Massimo Crudeli, senior manager and solution architect at AX for Pharma By Guest on 07 December 2017 \nThis article first appeared in the Autumn 2017 issue of The Record. \nIn every industry, most companies are carrying out digital transformations as part of their main business strategies. The first wave of the digital revolution focused on using data analytics to better understand customers, or in the case of life sciences companies, to better understand patients to improve engagement levels and develop new go-to-market approaches. \nThe next wave of the digital revolution is about transforming operations. Digitisation holds tremendous potential in helping pharmaceutical companies to adapt to the growing challenges of globalisation, greater supply chain complexity, price and cost pressures, personalised medicine, and more. \nProcess efficiency and agility is improving dramatically. Sensors and automation can deliver a step change in the efficiency, speed, quality and responsiveness of business processes in all industries. The pharmaceutical industry is no exception. To thrive in a digital world, pharmaceutical companies will need to deploy next-generation technologies to streamline their business processes. \nBy applying digital technology, these companies can significantly increase visibility into their supply chain operations and make better and faster decisions. Digitisation also allows organisations to fully integrate their supply chains and improve operational processes, making them more adaptive and responsive to change. As a result, planning accuracy, manufacturing efficiency and productivity, inventory levels, and service quality all improve. \nEvolving industry trends pose significant operational and supply chain challenges for the pharmaceutical industry. For example, the global market requires companies to operate across various geographies with an ever-growing number of items, which makes supply chain management, regulatory compliance, and lifecycle management more complex. The number of supply chain partners \u2013 including suppliers, contract manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, and third-party logistics partners \u2013 is also higher than ever before, so a lack of integrated planning across the network hinders real-time decision making. \nMany companies currently operate with cumbersome, inefficient networks that struggle to respond to dynamic shifts in supply and demand, but increasingly competitive price (and therefore cost) pressures require more efficient operations and supply chain management. Meanwhile, more complex product portfolios and a rise in personalised medicine call for greater customer and supply chain segmentation, challenging companies to produce low volumes efficiently. In addition, a growing risk of counterfeit drugs demands greater transparency and tracking in the value chain, so that companies can monitor the supply chain from end to end. Similarly, rising regulatory scrutiny around the world calls for better quality control and more visibility, so companies need better access to data about products in transit and at global hubs. \nDigitisation has the potential to help pharmaceutical companies address these challenges. Specifically, digitising the supply chain will allow companies to gain real-time visibility and make decisions more quickly, and improve operational processes and maintenance. In addition, technology enables end-to-end supply chain integration and greater network scalability, while allowing companies to boost manufacturing efficiency and productivity. \nGenerally, the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry is quite advanced in its application of technology, but has been very cautious when it comes to operations. Thus far, pharmaceutical companies are still relying on supply chain and manufacturing paradigms that have been around for a long time, largely due to the regulatory environment. \nModular solutions like AX for Pharma \u2013 built on the Microsoft Dynamics platform and specifically designed for the pharmaceutical, life sciences and biotechnology industries \u2013 gives companies a full overview and complete control over their supply chain, manufacturing, warehouse and distribution. \nAX for Pharma offers core enterprise resource planning, laboratory information management systems, manufacturing execution systems in modules like Basic Pharma, Advanced Quality Management, Weighing and Dispensing, and Advanced Warehouse Management. Together, these modules give a clear picture of everything that is going on in the organisation and allow companies to identify any issues, spot opportunities for process optimisation, and make faster and more informed decisions. \nAs a commercial-off-the-shelf solution, AX for Pharma has been extensively tested. This means it is quick, easy and cost effective to implement, extend and validate the solution if a company decides to start small and add more modules in future. \nDigitising the supply chain can help pharmaceutical companies to significantly improve their operational performance, and ultimately, strengthen their financial outlook. When implemented effectively, digitisation of the supply chain gives companies a true competitive advantage.

The Garden of Eden, the Ark, the Gate of the Temple, the Veil of the Mysteries, the  vesica piscis  or oval nimbus, and the Holy Grail are important yonic symbols; the pyramid, the obelisk, the cone, the candle, the tower, the Celtic monolith, the spire, the campanile, the Maypole, and the Sacred Spear are symbolic of the phallus. In treating the subject of Priapic worship, too many modern authors judge pagan standards by their own and wallow in the mire of self-created vulgarity. The Eleusinian Mysteries--the greatest of all the ancient secret societies--established one of the highest known standards of morality and ethics, and those criticizing their use of phallic symbols should ponder the trenchant words of King Edward III, \" Honi soit qui mal y pense .\" The obscene rites practiced by the later Bacchanalia and Dionysia were no more representative of the standards of purity originally upheld by the Mysteries than the orgies occasionally occurring among the adherents of Christianity till the eighteenth century were representative of primitive Christianity. Sir William Hamilton, British Minister at the Court of Naples, declares that in 1780, Isernia, a community of Christians in Italy, worshiped with phallic ceremonies the pagan god Priapus under the name of St. Cosmo. (See  Two Essays on the Worship of Priapus , by Richard Payne Knight.) Father, mother, and child constitute the natural trinity. The Mysteries glorified the home as the supreme institution consisting of this trinity functioning as a unit. Pythagoras likened the universe to the family, declaring that as the supreme fire of the universe was in the midst of its heavenly bodies, so, by analogy, the supreme fire of the world was upon its hearthstones. The Pythagorean and other schools of philosophy conceived the one divine nature of God to manifest itself in the threefold aspect of Father, Mother, and Child. These three constituted the Divine Family, whose dwelling place is creation and whose natural and peculiar symbol is the 47th problem of Euclid. God the Father is spirit, God the Mother is matter, and God the Child--the product of the two--represents the sum of living things born out of and constituting Nature. The seed of spirit is sown in the womb of matter, and by an immaculate (pure) conception the progeny is brought into being. Is not this the true mystery of the Madonna holding the Holy Babe in her arms? Who dares to say that such symbolism is improper? The mystery of life is the supreme mystery, revealed in all of its divine dignity and glorified as Nature's per feet achievement by the initiated sages and seers of all ages. The prudery of today, however, declares this same mystery to be unfit for the consideration of holy-minded people. Contrary to the dictates of reason, a standard has been established which affirms that innocence bred of ignorance is more to be desired than virtue born of knowledge. Eventually, however, man will learn that he need never be ashamed of truth. Until he does learn this, he is false to his God, to his world, and to himself. In this respect, Christianity has woefully failed in its mission. While declaring man's body to be the living temple of the living God, in the same breath it asserts the substances and functions of this temple to be unclean and their study defiling to the sensitive sentiments of the righteous. By this unwholesome attitude, man's body--the house of God--is degraded and defamed. Yet the cross itself is the oldest of phallic emblems, and the lozenge-shaped windows of cathedrals are proof that yonic symbols have survived the destruction of the pagan Mysteries. The very structure of the church itself is permeated with phallicism. Remove from the Christian Church all emblems of Priapic origin and nothing is left, for even the earth upon which it stands was, because of its fertility, the first yonic symbol. As the presence of these emblems of the generative processes is either unknown or unheeded by the majority, the irony of the situation is not generally appreciated. Only those conversant with the secret language of antiquity are capable of understanding the divine significance of these emblems. Flowers were chosen as symbols for many reasons. The great variety of flora made it possible to find some plant or flower which would be a suitable figure for nearly any abstract quality or condition. A plant might be chosen because of some myth connected with its origin, as the stories of Daphne and Narcissus; because of the peculiar environment in which it thrived, as the orchid and the fungus; because of its significant shape, as the passion flower and the Easter lily; because of its brilliance or fragrance, as the verbena and the sweet lavender; because it preserved its form indefinitely, as the everlasting flower; because of unusual characteristics as the sunflower and heliotrope, which have long been sacred because of their affinity for the sun. The plant might also be considered worthy of veneration because from its crushed leaves, petals, stalks, or roots could be extracted healing unctions, essences, or drugs affecting the nature and intelligence of human beings--such as the poppy and the ancient herbs of prophecy. The plant might also be regarded as efficacious in the cure of many diseases because its fruit, leaves, petals, or roots bore a resemblance in shape or color to parts or organs of the human body. For example, the distilled juices of certain species of ferns, also the hairy moss growing upon oaks, and the thistledown were said to have the power of growing hair; the  dentaria , which resembles a tooth in shape, was said to cure the toothache; and the  palma Christi  plant, because of its shape, cured all afflictions of the hands. The blossom is really the reproductive system of the plant and is therefore singularly appropriate as a symbol of sexual purity--an absolute requisite of the ancient Mysteries. Thus the flower signifies this ideal of beauty and regeneration which must ultimately take the place of lust and degeneracy. Of all symbolic flowers the locus blossom of India and Egypt and the rose of the Rosicrucians are the most important. In their symbolism these two flowers are considered identical. The esoteric doctrines for which the Eastern lotus stands have been perpetuated in modern Europe under the form of the rose. The rose and the lotus are yonic emblems, signifying primarily the maternal creative mystery, while the Easter lily is considered to be phallic. The Brahmin and Egyptian initiates, who undoubtedly understood the secret systems of spiritual culture whereby the latent centers of cosmic energy in man may be stimulated, employed the lotus blossoms to represent the spinning vortices of spiritual energy located at various points along the spinal column and called  chakras , or whirling wheels, by the Hindus. Seven of these  chakras  are of prime importance and have their individual correspondences in the nerve ganglia and plexuses. According to the secret schools, the sacral ganglion is called the four-petaled lotus; the prostatic plexus, the six-petaled lotus; the epigastric plexus and navel, the ten-petaled lotus; the cardiac plexus, the twelve-petaled lotus; the pharyngeal plexus, the sixteen-petaled locus; the cavernous plexus, the two-petaled lotus; and the pineal gland or adjacent unknown center, the thousand-petaled locus. The color, size, and number of petals upon the \n\nTHE TREE OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE.\n  This remarkable example of the use of the tree in symbolism is from the Chateau de Pierrefonds in the little town of Pierrefonds, northern France. The eight side branches end in conventional cup-like flowers, from each of which rises the body of a knight carrying in his hand a ribbon bearing his name. The central stem is surmounted by a larger flower, from which emerges the body of King Arthur himself. The tree is a favorite motif in heraldry. The one trunk with its multitude of branches caused the tree to be frequently used in diagramming family lineage, from which practice has arisen the custom of terming such tables \"family trees.\" p. 94 lotus are the keys to its symbolic import. A hint concerning the unfoldment of spiritual understanding according to the secret science of the Mysteries is found in the story of Aaron's rod that budded, and also in Wagner's great opera,  Tannh\u00e4user , where the budding staff of the Pope signifies the unfolding blossoms upon the sacred rod of the Mysteries--the spinal column. The Rosicrucians used a garland of roses to signify the same spiritual vortices, which are referred to in the Bible as the seven lamps of the candlestick and the seven churches of Asia. In the 1642 edition of Sir Francis Bacon's  History of Henry the Seventh  is a frontispiece showing Lord Bacon with Rosicrucian roses for shoe buckles. In the Hindu system of philosophy, each petal of the lotus bears a certain symbol which gives an added clue to the meaning of the flower. The Orientals also used the lotus plant to signify the growth of man through the three periods of human consciousness--ignorance, endeavor, and understanding. As the lotus exists in three elements (earth, water, and air) so man lives in three worlds--material, intellectual, and spiritual. As the plant, with its roots in the mud and the slime, grows upward through the water and finally blossoms forth in the light and air, so the spiritual growth of man is upward from the darkness of base action and desire into the light of truth and understanding, the water serving as a symbol of the ever-changing world of illusion through which the soul must pass in its struggle to reach the state of spiritual illumination. The rose and its Eastern equivalent, the lotus, like all beautiful flowers, represent spiritual unfoldment and attainment: hence, the Eastern deities are often shown seated upon the open petals of the lotus blossoms. The lotus was also a universal motif in Egyptian art and architecture. The roofs of many temples were upheld by lotus columns, signifying the eternal wisdom; and the lotus-headed scepter--symbolic of self-unfoldment and divine prerogative--was often carried in religious processions. When the flower had nine petals, it was symbolic of man; when twelve, of the universe and the gods; when seven, of the planets and the law; when five, of the senses and the Mysteries; and when three, of the chief deities and the worlds. The heraldic rose of the Middle Ages generally has either five or ten petals thereby showing its relationship to the spiritual mystery of man through the Pythagorean pentad and decad. CULTUS ARBORUM The worship of trees as proxies of Divinity was prevalent throughout the ancient world. Temples were often built in the heart of sacred groves, and nocturnal ceremonials were conducted under the wide-spreading branches of great trees, fantastically decorated and festooned in honor of their patron deities. In many instances the trees themselves were believed to possess the attributes of divine power and intelligence, and therefore supplications were often addressed to them. The beauty, dignity, massiveness, and strength of oaks, elms, and cedars led to their adoption as symbols of power, integrity, permanence, virility, and divine protection. Several ancient peoples--notably the Hindus and Scandinavians---regarded the Macrocosm, or Grand Universe, as a divine tree growing from a single seed sown in space. The Greeks, Persians, Chaldeans, and Japanese have legends describing the axle tree or reed upon which the earth revolves. Kapila declares the universe to be the eternal tree, Brahma, which springs from an imperceptible and intangible seed--the material monad. The medi\u00e6val Qabbalists represented creation as a tree with its roots in the reality of spirit and its branches in the illusion of tangible existence. The Sephirothic tree of the Qabbalah was therefore inverted, with its roots in heaven and its branches upon the earth. Madam Blavatsky notes that the Great Pyramid was considered to be a symbol of this inverted tree, with its root at the apex of the pyramid and its branches diverging in four streams towards the base. The Scandinavian world-tree, Yggdrasil, supports on its branches nine spheres or worlds,--which the Egyptians symbolized by the nine stamens of the persea or avocado. All of these are enclosed within the mysterious tenth sphere or cosmic egg--the definitionless Cipher of the Mysteries. The Qabbalistic tree of the Jews also consists of nine branches, or worlds, emanating from the First Cause or Crown, which surrounds its emanations as the shell surrounds the egg. The single source of life and the endless diversity of its expression has a perfect analogy in the structure of the tree. The trunk represents the single origin of all diversity; the roots, deeply imbedded in the dark earth, are symbolic of divine nutriment; and its multiplicity of branches spreading from the central trunk represent the infinity of universal effects dependent upon a single cause. The tree has also been accepted as symbolic of the Microcosm, that is, man. According to the esoteric doctrine, man first exists potentially within the body of the world-tree and later blossoms forth into objective manifestation upon its branches. According to an early Greek Mystery myth, the god Zeus fabricated the third race of men from ash trees. The serpent so often shown wound around the trunk of the tree usually signifies the mind--the power of thought--and is the eternal tempter or urge which leads all rational creatures to the ultimate discovery of reality and thus overthrows the rule of the gods. The serpent hidden in the foliage of the universal tree represents the cosmic mind; and in the human tree, the individualized intellect. The concept that all life originates from seeds caused grain and various plants to be accepted as emblematic of the human spermatozoon, and the tree was therefore symbolic of organized life unfolding from its primitive germ. The growth of the universe from its primitive seed may be likened to the growth of the mighty oak from the tiny acorn. While the tree is apparently much greater than its own source, nevertheless that source contains potentially every branch, twig, and leaf which will later be objectively unfolded by the processes of growth. Man's veneration for trees as symbols of the abstract qualities of wisdom and integrity also led him to designate as trees those individuals who possessed these divine qualities to an apparently superhuman degree. Highly illumined philosophers and priests were therefore often referred to as  trees  or  tree men --for example, the Druids, whose name, according to one interpretation, signifies  the men of the oak trees , or the initiates of certain Syrian Mysteries who were called  cedars ; in fact it is far more credible and probable that the famous  cedars of Lebanon , cut down for the building of King Solomon's Temple, were really illumined, initiated sages. The mystic knows that the true supports of God's Glorious House were not the logs subject to decay but the immortal and imperishable intellects of the tree hierophants. Trees are repeatedly mentioned in the Old and New Testaments, and in the scriptures of various pagan nations. The Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil mentioned in Genesis, the burning bush in which the angel appeared to Moses, the famous vine and fig tree of the New Testament, the grove of olives in the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus went to pray, and the miraculous tree of Revelation, which bore twelve manners of fruit and whose leaves were for the healing of the nations, all bear witness to the esteem in which trees were held by the scribes of Holy Writ. Buddha received his illumination while under the  bodhi  tree, near Madras in India, and several of the Eastern gods are pictured sitting in meditation beneath the spreading branches of mighty trees. Many of the great sages and saviors carried wands, rods, or staves cut from the wood of sacred trees, as the rods of Moses and Aaron; Gungnir--the spear of Odin--cut from the Tree of Life; and the consecrated rod of Hermes, around which the fighting serpents entwined themselves. The numerous uses which the ancients made of the tree and its products are factors in its symbolism. Its worship was, to a certain degree, based upon its usefulness. Of this J. P. Lundy writes: \"Trees occupy such an important place in the economy of nature by way of attracting and retaining moisture, and shading the water-sources and the soil so as to prevent barrenness and desolation; the), are so \n\nTHE TREE OF NOAH.\n  From the \" Breeches \"  Bible of 1599 . Most Bibles published during the Middle Ages contain a section devoted to genealogical tables showing the descent of humanity from Father Adam to the advent of Jesus Christ. The tree growing from the roof of the Ark represents the body of Noah and its three branches, his sons--Shem, Ham, and Japheth. The nations by the descendents of Noah's three sons are appropriately shown in the circles upon the branches of the tree. While such tables are hopelessly incorrect from a historical point of view, to the symbolist their allegorical interpretations are of inestimable importance. p. 95 useful to man for shade, for fruit, for medicine, for fuel, for building houses and ships, for furniture, for almost every department of life, that it is no wonder that some of the more conspicuous ones, such as the oak, the pine, the palm, and the sycamore, have been made sacred and used for worship.\" (See  Monumental Christianity .) The early Fathers of the church sometimes used the tree to symbolize Christ. They believed that ultimately Christianity would grow up like a mighty oak and overshadow all other faiths of mankind. Because it annually discards its foliage, the tree was also looked upon as an appropriate emblem of resurrection and reincarnation, for though apparently dying each fall it blossomed forth again with renewed verdure each ensuing spring. Under the appellations of the  Tree of Life  and the  Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil  is concealed the great arcanum of antiquity--the mystery of  equilibrium . The  Tree of Life  represents the spiritual point of balance--the secret of immortality. The  Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil , as its name implies, represents polarity, or unbalance--the secret of mortality. The Qabbalists reveal this by assigning the central column of their Sephirothic diagram to the  Tree of Life  and the two side branches to the  Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil . \"Unbalanced forces perish in the void,\" declares the secret work, and all is made known. The apple represents the knowledge of the procreative processes, by the awakening of which the material universe was established. The allegory of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden is a cosmic myth, revealing the methods of universal and individual establishment. The literal story, accepted for so many centuries by an unthinking world, is preposterous, but the creative mystery of which it is the symbol is one of Nature's profoundest verities. The Ophites (serpent worshipers) revered the Edenic snake because it was the cause of individual existence. Though humanity is still wandering in a world of good and evil, it will ultimately attain completion and eat of the fruit of the Tree of Life growing in the midst of the illusionary garden of worldly things. Thus the  Tree of Life  is also the appointed symbol of the Mysteries, and by partaking of its fruit man attains immortality. The oak, the pine, the ash, the cypress, and the palm are the five trees of greatest symbolic importance. The Father God of the Mysteries was often worshiped under the form of an oak; the Savior God--frequently the World Martyr--in the form of a pine; the world axis and the divine nature in humanity in the form of an ash; the goddesses, or maternal principle, in the form of a cypress; and the positive pole of generation in the form of the inflorescence of the mate date palm. The pine cone is a phallic symbol of remote antiquity. The thyrsus of Bacchus--a long wand or staff surmounted by a pine cone or cluster of grapes and entwined with ivy or grape-vine leaves, sometimes ribbons--signifies that the wonders of Nature may only be accomplished by the aid of solar virility, as symbolized by the cone or grapes. In the Phrygian Mysteries, Atys--the ever-present sun-savior--dies under the branches of the pine tree (an allusion to the solar globe at the winter solstice) and for this reason the pine tree was sacred to his cult. This tree was also sacred in the Mysteries of Dionysos and Apollo. Among the ancient Egyptians and Jews the acacia, or tamarisk, was held in the highest religious esteem; and among modern Masons, branches of acacia, cypress, cedar, or evergreen are still regarded as most significant emblems. The shittim-wood used by the children of Israel in the construction of the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant was a species of acacia. In describing this sacred tree, Albert Pike has written: \"The genuine acacia, also, is the thorny tamarisk, the same tree which grew around the body of Osiris. It was a sacred tree among the Arabs, who made of it the idol Al-Uzza, which Mohammed destroyed. It is abundant as a bush in the desert of Thur; and of it the 'crown of thorns' was composed, which was set on the forehead of Jesus of Nazareth. It is a fit type of immortality on account of its tenacity of life; for it has been known, when planted as a door-post, to take root again and shoot out budding boughs above the \"threshold.\" (See  Morals and Dogma .) It is quite possible that much of the veneration accorded the acacia is due to the peculiar attributes of the  mimosa , or sensitive plant, with which it was often identified by the ancients. There is a Coptic legend to the effect that the sensitive plant was the first of all trees or shrubs to worship Christ. The rapid growth of the acacia and its beauty have also caused it to be regarded as emblematic of fecundity and generation. The symbolism of the acacia is susceptible of four distinct interpretations: (1) it is the emblem of the vernal equinox--the annual resurrection of the solar deity; (2) under the form of the sensitive plant which shrinks from human touch, the acacia signifies purity and innocence, as one of the Greek meanings of its name implies; (3) it fittingly typifies human immortality and regeneration, and under the form of the evergreen represents that immortal part of man which survives the destruction of his visible nature; (4) it is the ancient and revered emblem of the Mysteries, and candidates entering the tortuous passageways in which the ceremonials were given carried in their hands branches of these sacred plants or small clusters of sanctified flowers. Albert G. Mackey calls attention to the fact that each of the ancient Mysteries had its own peculiar plant sacred to the gods or goddesses in whose honor the rituals were celebrated. These sacred plants were later adopted as the symbols of the various degrees in which they were used. Thus, in the Mysteries of Adonis, lettuce was sacred; in the Brahmin and Egyptian rites, the lotus; among the Druids, the mistletoe; and among certain of the Greek Mysteries, the myrtle. (See  Encyclop\u00e6dia of Freemasonry .) As the legend of CHiram Abiff is based upon the ancient Egyptian Mystery ritual of the murder and resurrection of Osiris, it is natural that the sprig of acacia should be preserved as symbolic of the resurrection of CHiram. The chest containing the body of Osiris was washed ashore near Byblos and lodged in the roots of a tamarisk, or acacia, which, growing into a mighty tree, enclosed within its trunk the body of the murdered god. This is undoubtedly the origin of the story that a sprig of acacia marks the grave of CHiram. The mystery of the evergreen marking the grave of the dead sun god is also perpetuated in the Christmas tree. The apricot and quince are familiar yonic symbols, while the bunch of grapes and the fig are phallic. The pomegranate is the mystic fruit of the Eleusinian rites; by eating it, Prosperine bound herself to the realms of Pluto. The fruit here signifies the sensuous life which, once tasted, temporarily deprives man of immortality. Also on account of its vast number of seeds the pomegranate was often employed to represent natural fecundity. For the same reason, Jacob Bryant in his  Ancient Mythology  notes that the ancients recognized in this fruit an appropriate emblem of the Ark of the Deluge, \nTHE SUNFLOWER.\n  From Kircher's  Magnes sive de Arte Magnetica Opus Tripartitum . The above diagram illustrates a curious experiment in plant magnetism reproduced with several other experiments in Athanasius Kircher's rare volume on magnetism. Several plants were sacred to the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Hindus because of the peculiar effect which the sun exerted over them. As it is difficult for man to look upon the face of the sun without being blinded by the light, those plants which turned and deliberately faced the solar orb were considered typical of very highly advanced souls. Since the sun was regarded as the personification of the Supreme Deity, those forms of life over which it exercised marked influence were venerated as being sacred to Divinity. The sunflower, because of its plainly perceptible affinity for the sun, was given high rank among sacred plants. p. 96 which contained the seeds of the new human race. Among the ancient Mysteries the pomegranate was also considered to be a divine symbol of such peculiar significance that its true explanation could not be divulged. It was termed by the Cabiri \"the forbidden secret.\" Many Greek gods and goddesses are depicted holding the fruit or flower of the pomegranate in their hands, evidently to signify that they are givers of life and plenty. Pomegranate capitals were placed upon the pillars of Jachin and Boaz standing in front of King Solomon's Temple; and by the order of Jehovah, pomegranate blossoms were embroidered upon the bottom of the High Priest's ephod. Strong wine made from the juice of the grape was looked upon as symbolic of the false life and false light of the universe, for it was produced by a false process--artificial fermentation. The rational faculties are clouded by strong drink, and the animal nature, liberated from bondage, controls the individual--facts which necessarily were of the greatest spiritual significance. As the lower nature is the eternal tempter seeking co lead man into excesses which inhibit the spiritual faculties, the grape and its product were used to symbolize the Adversary. The juice of the grape was thought by the Egyptians to resemble human blood more closely than did any other substance. In fact, they believed that the grape secured its life from the blood of the dead who had been buried in the earth. According to Plutarch, \"The priests of the sun at Heliopolis never carry any wine into their temples, * * * and if they made use of it at any time in their libations to the gods, it was not because they looked upon it as in its own nature acceptable to them; but they poured it upon their altars as the blood of those enemies who formerly had fought against them. For they look upon the vine to have first sprung out of the earth after it was fattened with the carcasses of those who fell in the wars against the gods. And this, say they, is the reason why drinking its juice in great quantities makes men mad and beside themselves, filling them as it were with the blood of their own ancestors.\" (See  Isis and Osiris .) Among some cults the state of intoxication was viewed as a condition somewhat akin to ecstasy, for the individual was believed to be possessed by the Universal Spirit of Life, whose chosen vehicle was the vine. In the Mysteries, the grape was often used to symbolize lust and debauchery because of its demoralizing effect upon the emotional nature. The fact was recognized, however, that fermentation was the certain evidence of the presence of the solar fire, hence the grape was accepted as the proper symbol of the Solar Spirit--the giver of divine enthusiasm. In a somewhat similar manner, Christians have accepted wine as the emblem of the blood of Christ, partaking of it in Holy Communion. Christ, the exoteric emblem of the Solar Spirit, said, \"I am the vine.\" He was therefore worshiped with the wine of ecstasy in the same manner as were his pagan prototypes--Bacchus, Dionysos, Arys, and Adonis. The  mandragora officinarum , or mandrake, is accredited with possessing the most remarkable magical powers. Its narcotic properties were recognized by the Greeks, who employed it to deaden pain during surgical operations, and it has been identified also with  baaras , the mystic herb used by the Jews for casting out demons. In the  Jewish Wars , Josephus describes the method of securing the  baaras , which he declares emits flashes of lightning and destroys all who seek to touch it, unless they proceed according to certain rules supposedly formulated by King Solomon himself. The occult properties of the mandrake, while little understood, have been responsible for the adoption of the plant as a talisman capable of increasing the value or quantity of anything with which it was associated. As a phallic charm, the mandrake was considered to be an infallible cure for sterility. It was one of the Priapic symbols which the Knights Templars were accused of worshiping. The root of the plant closely resembles a human body and often bore the outlines of the human head, arms, or legs. This striking similarity between the body of man and the mandragora is one of the puzzles of natural science and is the real basis for the veneration in which this plant was held. In  Isis Unveiled , Madam Blavatsky notes that the mandragora seems to occupy upon earth the point where the vegetable and animal kingdoms meet, as the zoophites and polypi do in die sea. This thought opens a vast field of speculation concerning the nature of this animal-plant. According to a popular superstition, the mandrake shrank from being touched and, crying out with a human voice, clung desperately to the soil in which it was imbedded. Anyone who heard its cry while plucking it either immediately died or went mad. To circumvent this tragedy, it was customary to dig around the roots of the mandrake until the plant was thoroughly loosened and then to tie one end of a cord about the stalk and fasten the other end to a dog. The dog, obeying his master's call, thereupon dragged the root from the earth and became the victim of the mandragora curse. When once uprooted, the plant could be handled with immunity. During the Middle Ages, mandrake charms brought great prices and an art was evolved by which the resemblance between the mandragora root and the human body was considerably accentuated. Like most superstitions, the belief in the peculiar powers of the mandrake was founded upon an ancient secret doctrine concerning the true nature of the plant. \"It is slightly narcotic,\" says Eliphas Levi, \"and an aphrodisiacal virtue was ascribed to it by the ancients, who represented it as being sought by Thessalian sorcerers for the composition of philtres. Is this root the umbilical vestige of our terrestrial origin, as a certain magical mysticism has suggested? We dare not affirm it seriously, but it is true all the same that man issued from the slime of earth and his first appearance must have been in the form of a rough sketch. The analogies of Nature compel us to admit the notion, at least as a possibility. The first men were, in this case, a family of gigantic, sensitive mandrogores, animated by the sun, who rooted themselves up from the earth.\" (See  Transcendental Magic .) The homely onion was revered by the Egyptians as a symbol of the universe because its rings and layers represented the concentric planes into which creation was divided according to the Hermetic Mysteries. It was also regarded as possessing great medicinal virtue. Because of peculiar properties resulting from its pungency, the garlic plant was a powerful agent in transcendental magic. To this day no better medium has been found for the treatment of obsession. Vampirism and certain forms of insanity--especially those resulting from mediumship and the influences of elemental larv\u00e6--respond immediately to the use of garlic. In the Middle Ages, its presence in a house was believed to ward off all evil powers. Trifoliate plants, such as the shamrock, were employed by many religious cults to represent the principle of the Trinity. St. Patrick is supposed to have used the shamrock to illustrate this doctrine of the triune Divinity. The reason for the additional sanctity conferred by a fourth leaf is that the fourth principle of the Trinity is man, and the presence of this leaf therefore signifies the redemption of humanity. Wreaths were worn during initiation into the Mysteries and the reading of the sacred books to signify that these processes were consecrated to the deities. On the symbolism of wreaths, Richard Payne Knight writes: \"Instead of beads, wreaths of foliage, generally of laurel, olive, myrtle, ivy, or oak, appear upon coins, sometimes encircling the symbolical figures, and sometimes as chaplets upon their heads. All these were sacred to some peculiar personifications of the deity, and significant of some particular attributes, and, in general, all evergreens were Dionysiac planes; that is, symbols of the generative power, signifying perpetuity of youth and vigor, as the circles of beads and diadems signify perpetuity of existence. (See  Symbolical Language of Ancient Art and Mythology .) \n\nTHE TREE OF ALCHEMY.\n  From  Mus\u00e6um Hermeticum Reformatum et Amplificatum . The alchemists were went to symbolize their metals by means of a tree, to indicate that all seven were branches dependent upon the single trunk of solar life. As the Seven Spirits depend upon God and are branches of a tree of which He is the root, trunk, and the spiritual earth from which the root derives its nourishment, so the single trunk of divine life and power nourishes all the multitudinous forms of which the universe is composed. \nIn  Gloria Mundi , from which the above illustration is reproduced, there is contained an important thought concerning the plantlike growth of metals: \"All trees, herbs, stones, metals, and minerals grow and attain to perfection without being necessarily touched by any human hand: for the seed is raised up from the ground, puts forth flowers, and bears fruit, simply through the agency of natural influences. As it is with plants, so it is with metals. While they lie in the heart of the earth, in their natural ore, they grow and are developed, day by day, through the influence of the four elements: their fire is the splendor of the Sun and Moon; the earth conceives in her womb the splendor of the Sun, and by it the seeds of the metals are well and equally warmed, just like the grain in the fields. * * * For as each tree of the field has its own peculiar shape, appearance, and fruit, so each mountain bears its own particular ore; those stones and that earth being the soil in which the metals grow.\" (See Translation of 1893.)

of Small Differences \n\nThe presidents of the United States and China are destined to clash, precisely because their economic worldviews are so similar. \n\nBy Christopher Balding \n\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in the Great Hall of the People, Beijing on Nov. 9. (Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images) \n\nPresident Donald Trump is returning home from an Asian trip during which the United States and China announced agreements worth over $250 billion. This allows Trump, who built much of his political identity on his supposed negotiating prowess and willingness to stand up to China, to return home triumphantly announcing his success at standing up to China. \n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, this supposed victory is entirely hollow. Most of the largesse comprises ongoing deals or ones unlikely to be executed; even if all of the $250 billion in deals is realized, it will have minimal impact on the structural United States trade deficit and does nothing to address the lack of market access facing foreign firms in China. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping carefully avoided any public discussion of more fundamental issues like market access to China by foreign firms. \n\nXi, who has staked his identity and regime upon projecting China as a great power on the same level as the United States and returning it to global prominence, had broader objectives in mind. In their joint press conference, Xi talked about \u201cpromoting coordination and cooperation among major countries\u201d to demonstrate to his domestic audience he treated Trump as an equal. \n\nBut his talk about cooperation did little to obscure the underlying conflict between Trump and Xi \u2014 a conflict that stems from their fundamental similarities rather than their superficial differences. Trump the brash-talking reality TV star and real estate mogul and Xi the guarded, re-educated party leader seem to share little in common. But they have fundamentally similar geopolitical \u2013 and, more specifically, geo-economic \u2014 worldviews. \n\nTrump and Xi are both strident nationalists. Trump\u2019s infamous \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d catch phrase strikes the same chord as Xi\u2019s sloganeering promotion \u201cnational rejuvenation\u201d or the \u201cChinese dream.\u201d Both romanticize historical eras when they their countries commanded more respect or power. Their visions of these periods may never have existed or censor out key historical details, but they both want to return to hazy replication of previous glories. \n\nNationalism informs their other agendas and how they pursue their goals. Flowing from their nationalist mindsets, Trump and Xi view the economic world in mercantilist terms. Trump prioritizes addressing the chronic U.S. trade deficit in the mistaken belief this is a sign of economic weakness and that surpluses equal strength. Xi prioritizes maintaining closed Chinese markets while prying open international markets to drive the trade surplus required by the capital accumulation model of economic growth. \n\nTheir latent nationalist mercantilism informs how and what objectives each pursues. Economic negotiations are seen as zero-sum games rather than attempts to expand the range and level of opportunities. Any agreement to open up markets implies a national weakness that may exacerbate the measure of national strength through the trade surplus. This approach narrows opportunity for agreement between countries. \n\nBeyond how Xi and Trump negotiate, mercantilism decides what they will negotiate. Gone are the days of negotiating sweeping, fundamentally revolutionary agreements, with the leaders instead focusing on transactional bargaining that accomplishes no larger goal. In the spring, Trump and Xi announced a 10-point agreement on narrowly focused issues such as U.S. beef exports and Chinese bank investigations in the United States. Described as a \u201cherculean\u201d effort, this agreement contained no larger objectives remaining purely transactional. Market access issues were similarly absent from the recent package of deals. Even China\u2019s announcement that it will allow foreigners to own Chinese banks seems like an attempt to persuade foreigners to bail out an increasingly shaky financial system rather than a principled shift in market access. \n\nNegotiation between the two major global powers focuses on specific transactions rather than advancing broad principles. \n\nThis shift bears significant consequences for the state of the bilateral economic relationship. \n\nDespite Trump\u2019s focus on addressing the trade deficit with China, it is simply an impossibility to arrest a $350 billion deficit via individual transactions negotiated by the president. Absent a broader agreement, either on a bilateral basis or, preferably, a multilateral one, transactional negotiation will fail to prevent an expansion of the trade deficit worsening Chinese-U.S. economic relations. \n\nIt also further entrenches Chinese interests in an illiberal world order. For all the hand-wringing over Trump\u2019s isolationist rhetoric, the world has feted Chairman Xi\u2019s closing of Chinese markets and nationalist industrial policies. The longer Trump focuses on transactional negotiations rather than principles, the more entrenched illiberal Chinese market practices will take hold and dominate. Perversely, Trump attempting to reduce the U.S.-China trade deficit one transaction at a time is further entrenching the illiberal market practices China holds at home and projects abroad.

PST December 06, 2017 Photo: Thinkstock CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nThe holidays are prime time for engagements. But diamonds aren\u2019t always your wallet\u2019s best friend, especially during engagement season. \nThe Knot 2016 Real Weddings Survey found the average engagement ring costs $6,163, which has helped push the average cost of weddings to an all-time high of $35,329. \nSome couples are saving dollars with affordable gemstones and cuts for a ring still worthy of showing off. \n\u201cThe most important thing to remember is that a couple chooses a ring they love for the look or design of it, and that it fits in their budget,\u201d says Anne Chertoff, wedding trends expert at WeddingWire.com. \nHere\u2019s a look at four engagement ring alternatives and ways to save. \nGive gemstones a look \u201cMore and more brides are wanting to have their unique personality shine through with their engagement ring,\u201d says Amanda Gizzi, spokesperson for the New York-based Jewelers of America. \u201cAnd color is a great way to do that.\u201d \nOne way to work color into a ring \u2014 and save on the cost \u2014 is to opt for a colorful gemstone rather than a diamond. \nChertoff says the interest in gemstone engagement rings spiked when Kate Middleton, now the Duchess of Cambridge, wore an engagement ring featuring a sapphire surrounded by a ring of diamonds in November 2010. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase in gemstones for the center stone or for the side stone,\u201d she says. \nColorful gemstones such as sapphires, emeralds and rubies can serve as the main stone or unique accents, as an alternative to using all diamonds. \nBlue, pink, and yellow are among the most popular sapphires, Chertoff says, while there\u2019s a growing interest in purple sapphires. Sapphire rings range ranging from several hundred dollars to more than $1,000, depending on size and design. \nFake it For those who want the appearance of a diamond without the hefty price tag, gemstones that resemble a diamond are a great option. Your friends aren\u2019t going to ask for an appraisal on your engagement ring, so if that elegant, adorned style is most important to you, a diamond look-alike may be perfect. \n\u201cA diamond made in a lab is always going to be less expensive than a diamond that was organically made and mined,\u201d Chertoff says. \nThe most well-known \u201cfake diamond,\u201d cubic zirconia, is much less expensive than a real diamond. This man-made gemstone comes from all over the world and is available in almost any color. The average cubic zirconia is about $100, and you can find cubic zirconia set in 14- or 18-carat gold or platinum, ranging from several hundred dollars to $1,000, depending on size and design. \nMoissanite options also come in for less than $1,000 at some jewelers. White sapphires also offer the sparkly appearance of a diamond but cost much less. Consider the carat and the cut Gemstones are usually sold on the half carat, but Chertoff proposes \u201cbuying shy.\u201d \nIf you purchase a carat slightly off the half-carat, the naked eye can\u2019t tell the difference, but you\u2019ll feel it when you look at the price tag. For example, a 1.2-carat is cheaper than a 1.5-carat, but no one likely will be able to tell the difference. \nCut also matters when it comes to price. According to The 2017 National Jewelry Survey from WeddingWire, 22% of couples chose a round brilliant-cut ring but just 7% chose emerald cut, which is a cheaper option. However, Chertoff says the emerald cut \u201cis always going to appear larger than other kinds of cuts.\u201d \nChertoff also suggests a halo setting. The tiny diamonds surrounding the gemstone make it appear larger, and you can receive more glam for buck with a halo setting, according to the Jewelry Wise website, which is sponsored by Signet Jewelers Limited, whose stores include Kay Jewelers, Zales, and Jared The Galleria of Jewelry. \nCheck out Etsy \nLooking for an affordable, one-of-a-kind ring? Etsy, the online marketplace for handmade and vintage items, has become a source for unique engagement rings. \nYou\u2019ll find champagne sapphires , hand-crafted, sculpture-like bronze rings , and vintage options in art deco and other styles. \nEtsy\u2019s options also include custom and personalized rings. According to the 2017 National Jewelry Survey from WeddingWire, 66% of proposers gave a custom ring. \n\u201cIt\u2019s all about personalization,\u201d Gizzi says. \nIf an online experience isn\u2019t what you\u2019re looking for, there are always jewelers that specialize in vintage rings that may cost less but come with a lot of history. \nMagnifyMoney is a price comparison and financial education website, founded by former bankers who use their knowledge of how the system works to help you save money. \nMagnifyMoney ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ellie holt", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amanda gizzi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chertoff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "etsy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kate middleton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anne chertoff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gizzi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "signet jewelers limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kay jewelers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:20:14.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "addc871b9766092d2827aaa19c217ee050339db6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUUC4XTyMkce6UdM0Xt0opFb9d0nzhDZ3TAOZVktzEoJjn76yol6ARmSXNAzNk8Kexzw2CwtaE63pXCHFQvD45.zVHBHM3regXM8Xj_Pv7RNZGlciyruWCM-", "site_full": "www.expedia.com", "site": "expedia.com", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com/Vaudreuil-Hotels.d55447.Travel-Guide-Hotels", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Top 10 Vaudreuil Hotels $54 | Hotel Deals on Expedia.com", "title": "Sheraton Montreal Airport Hotel:", "title_full": "Sheraton Montreal Airport Hotel: 2017 Room Prices, Deals & Reviews | Expedia", "published": "2017-10-16T20:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 416, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9464d69bf092ecf2add849f01891a0577809d38a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbUUC4XTyMkce6UdM0Xt0opFb9d0nzhDZ3TAOZVktzEoJjn76yol6ARmSXNAzNk8Kexzw2CwtaE63pXCHFQvD45.zVHBHM3regXM8Xj_Pv7RNgHo4a05lsdnmmLD4s2T5i7Y1pG.b4_py7cmlvSNjBsE-", "ord_in_thread": 16, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-11-18T18:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Airport shuttle every 10-15 minutes.

It's not only a compact, complex and deafening on many levels sound, it's also similarly diffused vocals and incredibly catchy chorus: \"our time to decide\" repeated like a mantra. \nThe shoegaze noise sounds really well, especially in \"christaline\" in the background of which we can spot an electrical reference to the legendary \"Loveless\" Nevertheless, the melody here still doesn't loose its importance.
