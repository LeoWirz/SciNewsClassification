December 7, 2017 General News of Thursday, 7 December 2017 Source: Graphic.com.gh \n2017-12-07 Togolese President Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 shaking Otumfuo\u2019s hand The Togolese President, Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 was at the Manhyia Palace in Kumasi on Wednesday to mourn with Asanteman on the sixth day of the final funeral rites of the late Asantehemaa, Nana Afia Kobi Serwaa Ampem II. \nMr Gnassingb\u00e9 flew into Kumasi from Lom\u00e9 and spent less than an hour at the Dwabrem of the Manhyia Palace where the \u2018Ohemaa Ayikese\u2019\u2013 as the final funeral rites is called in Asante tradition \u2013 was held. \nHe was led by the Ashanti Regional Minister, Mr Simon Osei Mensah, to pay homage to the Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II who sat in state to receive sympathisers from far and near. \nMr Gnassingb\u00e9 is the first foreign Head of State to participate in the final funeral rites. \nThe 6th day of the funeral also recorded a historic moment when the Techimanhene, Oseadeeyo Akumfi Ameyaw made an entry to the Manhyia Palace, in a palanquin. \nThat was after the Asantehene had also arrived at the Dwabirem riding in a palanquin. \nFor more than 100 years, the Techimanhene never stepped foot at the Manhyia Palace but earlier this year in January, during the burial rites (Doteyie) of the Asantehemaa, Oseadeeyo Akumfi Ameyaw attended. \nThis followed a recent visit to the Techimanhene\u2019s Palace by Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, a development that helped to bury the age-old frosty relationship between the Asantehene and Techimanhene.",

From backyards to VFW halls to carnivals and fairs, pro wrestling can really work anywhere - though this new venue might actually be a first for the sport.\nOn December 1, independent wrestling promotion Mondo Lucha teamed up with the Milwaukee Public Library to run a free, family-friendly show as part of their \"Library Loud Days\" series. Among the wrestlers slated to appear were Impact Wrestling star DJZ, plus Isaias Velazquez, Xavier Mustafa and more. And wouldn't you know, Milwaukee was super into it, snatching up approximately 500 tickets ahead of time, making the event a sold-out show. Check out local news station WISN's report:\nBut just because the event was at max capacity doesn't mean people were left out: The Milwaukee Public Library livestreamed the whole dang thing, which you can watch below (heads up: the audio is kinda wonky for the first few minutes, but it works itself out eventually).\nBut wait, there's more: Mondo Lucha also used the library's multimedia equipment to allow fans to cut and edit their own promos, plus they gave away tons of posters and luchador masks:\nTruly, this is the best use of Wisconsinites' tax dollars. I'm calling the Cleveland Public Library now to tell them the bar has been raised.\nWithout being on the inside of planning I can only speculate, the library may not have put up a dime beyond turning on lights, and having some staff there.\nI have been part of a cage fight event, held at my work. Our cost was only lights, staff, and food & drink. The cage fight promoter brought the cage and crew, fighters, paramedics, and security. They kept the ticket sales, we charged for parking, and sold concession food and lots of alcohol. The rink netted a few thousand dollars, and that wasn't even considered a successful event. The promotor got dropped by the cage fighting group, and took their business to Dort Event Center, our partnered rink.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:03.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "87b70191aed37e3bd2180c38a8a1b1a2c10ae561", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjKETTmcQmnvKiwcT2Ebeoz2blZsgiJFBdNl8wMqA1sJJ2zPOua5OtR1w8tnPkTtW_pNw.CdEyMHvxHHepYfue_qtinT4O0RKW2v3_Ou2n1u_XaOUXoMY.8c-", "site_full": "www.startribune.com", "site": "startribune.com", "site_section": "http://www.startribune.com/local/index.rss2", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "StarTribune.com | Local News", "title": "Sen.

Jill Barta scored 15 and Jessie Loera added nine points as she continued her great play. Chandler Smith scored eight points and had a career-high 11 rebounds to lead the team. Emma Stach and Laura Stockton had four assists each to lead the Zags. \nThe Zags had turnovers on their first two possessions, but offensive boards from Rice and Smith led to a 4-2 Zag lead. After WSU went up 6-4, quick Zag ball movement led to a Barta three from the wing. Five minutes in there was nine total turnovers and seven fouls as WSU led 10-9. A great high-low from Rice to Barta beat the shot clock as GU regained the 11-10 lead. The Zags outscored the Cougars 6-3 over the last four minutes capped by a fastbreak three from Barta as Stockton found her trailing. WSU hit a three late and GU led 16-13 after one. An offensive rebound led to an early three from Stach and GU extended their lead to 21-17. A corner three from Barta off the inbounds made it 24-18 as GU extended the 6-1 run. The Cougars got four possessions off offensive rebounds to kill the run. \nWSU closed the gap to 26-25, but Barta took two defenders to the basket to regain the three-point edge. Stockton then drew the defense into the corner and found Rice for the basket. The Cougars closed the half on a 4-0 run and the game was tied at 30 at the half. Barta finished the half with 15 points, hitting three three-pointers and Rice added six points. Smith led the way with seven rebounds, and GU shot 44 percent from the field, and four-for-four from three. \nSmith beat the shot clock with a pull-up early in the second to keep the lead 34-32. WSU responded with five-straight to lead 37-34. Stockton took it right at the basket and tied it at 39 with 3:30 left to play. Jill Townsend tied the game at 43 on a transition three-point play with two minutes left in the quarter. The quarter ended in a tie at 43 as both teams went scoreless over the final two minutes. \nLoera opened the fourth with a floater over the WSU post to regain the lead GU would not lose. The Zags extended the WSU scoreless streak for another 2:30 minutes and led 47-45. Loera spun a three in and GU extended their lead to 52-47 with 5:44 remaining. Rice skied above everyone at the defensive end for a rebound then grabbed an offensive rebound for the three-point play at 4:00 for GU's 55-49 lead. WSU's field goal drought hit 3:30 before they hit a three to cut to lead to 57-52, but Smith responded with a three to reclaim their largest lead to that point and seal the win. The Cougars were quiet from three late and GU took home the 64-56 win. \n\"I am really proud of our team and how gritty we played tonight,\" Gonzaga head coach Lisa Fortier said. \"It was never pretty, but we got tough at the right time and found a way. We had a bunch of players step up at critical times for shots, rebounds, and big time team defensive plays.\" \nThe Zags fought off 26 turnovers, in a game where WSU turned it over 17 times and there were 48 total fouls, by shooting 46 percent from the field and they were six-of-nine from three. WSU did most of their damage with 28 offensive boards, but GU held them to 28 percent shooting. GU scored 17 second-chance points and were 16-of-24 from the line. \nGonzaga (5-3) will return home on Saturday at 2 pm to face UNLV.

Peter Micciche (R-Soldotna), at a work session on Monday with the school board, Rep. Mike Chenault (R-Nikiski) and Rep. Paul Seaton (R-Homer). \u201cOur goal is to have a Senate and a House budget that are very close, if not the same, on education specifically from the onset \u2026 We know how much talent we lost last year, instructors that went elsewhere because they got tired of waiting \u2026 From a Senate side, we certainly don\u2019t want to see that happen again and we are going to do our part to avoid it.\u201d \nSeaton and Chenault echoed Micciche\u2019s sentiments that there probably wouldn\u2019t be any cuts, but not without trepidation. \n\u201cI\u2019m not expecting, probably, any cuts (to education), but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to be talked about,\u201d Chenault said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be talks about reductions in other departments, too. When there is deficit spending, we need to talk about the costs of government and other ways we can deliever a better service.\u201d \nMicciche added that the Legislature was wary of timing this time around. \n\u201cI would not expect an increase because that\u2019s simply not going to happen,\u201d Micciche said. \u201cThe districts are going to have to adjust to this level for at least another year but I think we\u2019ll all be in the agreement of getting education out of the way. We just lost too much ground and a lot of talent because of the time it took for K-12 funding. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see that again, but I think the wrong tactic would be to come down and ask for more money again this year.\u201d \nChenault recognized the issues associated with flat funding. \n\u201cIt is a reduction, every year, whenever you don\u2019t get an increase,\u201d Chenault said. \u201cYou can call it inflation or insurance cost increase\u2026 but that money doesn\u2019t go as far as it did last year.\u201d \nLast year, the state allocated about $87.1 million of funding to the district, which includes about $79.2 million from the state Foundation Funding Formula. This is combined with the Kenai Peninsula Borough\u2019s appropriation of about $49.73 million in FY18, which was an increase of $1.5 million from FY17. \nDuring a work session with the assembly on Tuesday, Dusek thanked the borough for their continued support of the school district but said that this year, the district would like to work even closer with the assembly throughout the budget process. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve decided to begin this process with the assembly much earlier than in the past,\u201d Dusek said. \u201c\u2026 As we found last year, if it wasn\u2019t for the borough, we would\u2019ve had to have held on to a lot more positions and not filled them and lose some great teachers. You guys came through earlier than the legislature did and we want to thank you for that.\u201d \nWhen determining the borough contribution to the district\u2019s budget, the borough and state use the Base Student Allocation formula to find the district\u2019s basic need. Basic need is determined and then met through the state\u2019s and borough\u2019s contributions, with the borough meeting a minimum contribution of at least $27 million. The borough, though, can fund at a rate of anywhere from the minimum contribution to the maximum allowable contribution of just over $51 million. \n\u201c(The state) expect the borough to pay a minimum contribution,\u201d Dusek said. \u201c\u2026So that\u2019s subtracted from (the state\u2019s) basic need\u2026We\u2019re fortunate because you value education and in very lean years you have funded to the maximum allowable.\u201d \nAt the start of this year\u2019s planning for the FY19 budget, the district is assuming flat funding from both the state and the borough, as well as just over $9 million from investments, interest and other revenue sources. \n\u201cSo, our total revenue that we project for next year, as we start this process, starts at $138 million,\u201d Dusek said. \u201cWhat would it cost us just to roll everything forward? We roll it forward and our total expenditures are a little over $139 million. So if you take projected revenues, keep everything the same for expenditures, we would just have a minimum deficit of $800,000.\u201d \nDusek warned, though, that the deficit was likely to increase as the district faces rising heath care costs and upcoming contract negotiations. \nIn the past few years, to combat dwindling revenues, Dusek said the district has cut utility costs and staffing at a district and school level. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve made the cuts over the last few years,\u201d Dusek said. \u201c\u2026 We have been making those tough decisions.\u201d \nFor this upcoming budget year, Dusek said he\u2019d like to continue investing in the district\u2019s manageable class sizes, interventionists in the classrooms, programmatic staffing and career and technical opportunities. \n\u201cLet\u2019s just say we have a deficit, but you guys would like to support us but your question is, \u2018What are you going to spend your money on?\u2019 We\u2019re going to invest in what\u2019s working,\u201d Dusek said. \nAssembly members were mute on any talk of numbers, but recognized the importance of staying involved in the district\u2019s budget process. \n\u201cI see real benefit in us gathering a number of times to see the preparation that goes into putting the budget together,\u201d said Borough Mayor Charlie Pierce. \u201cOne of the things that was a concern to me was that we had a month, sometimes less than a month to approve a budget and you were expected to understand all the intricate parts and know that you\u2019re doing justice to the process. It\u2019s the largest part of our budget that we approve annually\u2026 We\u2019ll direct some dollars to take care of the business at the end of the day.\u201d \nReach Kat Sorensen at kat.sorensen@peninsulaclarion.com.

Guilty or innocence doesn't matter, it's all about the perception. Politicians and the media created this monster, now they are feeling the effects of it. They allowed nothing stories to grow out of control, when a lack of facts was evident, they pushed a narrative of perception being the big thing and not facts.

The owners of the 39 properties included in the area will pay $5,694 per parcel for a total cost of approximately $222,098 for the total project. Enstar Natural Gas Co. built the pipeline itself and the borough will use the funds to reimburse the company. \n\u201cThis is the final step for the borough in a process that began with the borough mayor approving the petition application for the formation of the District, the adoption of the (establishing) resolution which formed the district and authorized construction of the improvements, and the passage of the (appropriation) ordinance which appropriated $22,098.76 for this project,\u201d wrote Borough Director of Finance Brandi Harbaugh in a memo to the assembly. \nThe system of residents opting into a gas line or other public infrastructure by paying an assessment on their properties is called a special assessment district \u2014 in this case, a utility special assessment district. Residents gather signatures from neighbors and submit them to the borough to prove there is community support. A petition has to have at least 60 percent of the property owners\u2019 approval to go through. \nIn the South Kasilof Utility Special Assessment District case, about 79.5 percent of the parcel owners voted yes on the project. However, a few asked the assembly at the Tuesday meeting to exempt them from paying for it. \nRaymond Davis, who owns two parcels property in the area, told the assembly that he never plans to use the natural gas pipeline and felt he shouldn\u2019t be held financially responsible for it. Because he owns two parcels, he is responsible for more than $11,300 in assessment costs for the pipeline. He said no one approached him with the petition. \n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a financial hardship \u2014 it\u2019s more like extortion, bringing it in and we have to pay for it whether we use it or not,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026I would like you to take that into consideration and terminate my assessment.\u201d \nAnother neighbor, Paul Vos, told the assembly he felt similarly. With wood stoves as his primary heating source inside his home, he said he never planned to take advantage of the gas line coming to the neighborhood. The approved assessment roll before the assembly recorded that he and his wife voted yes on the proposal, but he said he felt pushed into the project by its proponents. \n\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve given it a lot of thought, studied it, did the math and it didn\u2019t equate,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 I still didn\u2019t like the idea of having to purchase a product I do not want. We moved to Kasilof 11, 12 years ago, built a house that was designed to be heated with wood and backup heat with propane. I\u2019m perfectly happy with that and contented with it.\u201d \nAssembly member Kelly Cooper said she understood where the neighbors were coming from but that the majority of the parcel owners did vote yes. She also pointed out that there was significant time in the petition process for people to change their minds. \n\u201cI understand \u2026 about not wanting the product and I am sensitive to that, but that is our code,\u201d she said. \u201cOne could argue that it does add some value to your property. You may not agree with that or not.\u201d \nPublic improvement projects are rarely without opposition in the borough . When they come before the assembly they have typically been in the works for some time, and the majority of neighbors approved it though a few ask the assembly to deny the project because of concerns about cost. During a debate over the assembly\u2019s approval of a utility special assessment district for the east end of Funny River Road, multiple people presented the same argument that they didn\u2019t plan to take advantage of the gas line so shouldn\u2019t be held responsible for the project. \nThe property owners in the Kasilof utility special assessment district can either pay the whole cost up front or space it out over 10 years, beginning in March 2018, accruing 6.25 percent interest annually, according to the ordinance. \nReach Elizabeth Earl at elizabeth.earl@peninsulaclarion.com.

That honour belongs instead to one Ryan Reynolds. \nToday, Legendary Entertainment announced to The Hollywood Reporter that Reynolds has been cast as the Detective Pikachu in its upcoming live-action film about the talking electric Pok\u00e9mon who also happens to solve mysteries. Reynolds joins Justice Smith and Kathryn Newton, whose characters will aid Pikachu as he investigates the kidnapping of Smith\u2019s character\u2019s father. \nDetails about Detective Pikachu are sparse right now aside from the broad strokes of the plot, but Reynolds\u2019 casting is really the key piece of information here given how important and, frankly, odd his role in the film will be. Obviously, Pok\u00e9mon do not typically speak (Team Rocket\u2019s Meowth notwithstanding), so Reynolds\u2019 performance will likely determine whether the film makes or breaks it at the office.

The nonprofit held a community open house at its headquarters behind Soldotna Creek Park on Wednesday night to celebrate the events of the past year.

Certainly not the five Native American tribes that consider Bears Ears sacred and pushed for the creation of the monument. Tribal leaders representing the Navajo, Hopi, Pueblo of Zuni, Ute Mountain and Ute Indians said they will take the Trump administration to court to challenge the action on Bears Ears. Other groups are planning to sue over Grand Staircase-Escalante. \nThe president\u2019s action wasn\u2019t some surprise out of left field. It was foretold by an opaque process of evaluating monuments created since 1996, which resulted in Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke\u2019s recommendation to change the boundaries of six of the 27 monuments under review. But details were withheld until Trump\u2019s announcement provided specifics on the two Utah monuments. \nIronically, the legal argument challenging Trump\u2019s action is that it amounts to presidential overreach \u2014 an accusation Trump has leveled often at his Democratic predecessors. \nThe notion that a president can actually shrink or abolish a monument is of questionable legality. Legal experts say that has historically been the role of Congress. Meanwhile, 16 presidents have used the Antiquities Act to create public lands monuments, including some of Colorado\u2019s most exemplary natural treasures: the Great Sand Dunes, Browns Canyon, Chimney Rock, and our own Colorado National Monument. \nAs unsettling as we find the president\u2019s unprecedented action, he\u2019s pushed the envelope so far on this issue that at least we\u2019ll get some legal clarity out of this controversy. \nThe implications are huge. If Trump\u2019s legal interpretation of the Antiquities Act wins the day, future presidents could alter any monument established by their predecessors. That means the potential to open once protected areas for all kinds of development. \nFor now, Trump\u2019s decision on Utah monuments looks like a win for Utah\u2019s Republicans in Congress, fossil fuel companies and anyone who thinks monument designations strangle revenue and limit access. But in a 2017 poll of seven Western states, 80 percent of voters supported keeping protections for existing national monuments \u2014 suggesting that a president who mounted a sustained assault on those protections could pay a political price. \nIt\u2019s going to be up to the courts to determine if the president has the green light to test the public\u2019s appetite for more of this anti-conservation agenda. \n\u2014 The (Grand Junction, Colorado) Daily Sentinel, \nDec. 5", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ryan zinke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pueblo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "daily sentinel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado national monument", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ute indians", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interior", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado) daily sentinel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hopi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chimney rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ute mountain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navajo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "browns canyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:04.033+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e5230039df345fc833f11b8daa6aedbd691dc6e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSbtkhQ3xn8ZRkMKf6PSBfnkQJW0KyS8FcNArHU_KtUtksSzf_BjYub8KJdB3V5K.depAZvJR3EjA--", "site_full": "rathoreblogs.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://rathoreblogs.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "India : USA \u2013 Rathore blogs", "title": "India : USA", "title_full": "India : USA", "published": "2017-12-07T11:47:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e5230039df345fc833f11b8daa6aedbd691dc6e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSbtkhQ3xn8ZRkMKf6PSBfnkQJW0KyS8FcNArHU_KtUtksSzf_BjYub8KJdB3V5K.depAZvJR3EjA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Saurav Singh Rathore", "published": "2017-12-07T11:47:00.000+02:00", "title": "India : USA", "text": "On the behalf of an Indian. \nBlend Of Differences: \nWe try to excel in a foreign language lifelong ( English ) whereas they try to excel in their own ( mother tongue ).

And a traditional 'how the shreck are ya'?' to y'all else out there...( and in here -Ed)...sure, howdy to you too Ed, you confected literary device you...( yeah, ya' know, I used to resent the fact that I don't actually exist other than here in this 'ere blog, but I have very much warmed to the role I play in presenting The Mount Gambier Independent -Ed)...the critical role mate, the critical role, without you I'd just be left mono-whinging and listing-off pros and/or cons, and most of my attempts at humour simply wouldn't work...( cheers mate- Ed)...no probs, in the last few weeks I've been very much been reminded about the power of a few positive words...( indeed- Ed)...and furthermore, that I'm not alone in this otherwise bigotted and insular town...( well hurrah!- Ed)...\n\nOnly a week ago I was still embroiled in my alleged 'Trial', after days of being deliberately subjected to the most hateful and corrupted bastardisation of appropriate Legal Process, under undisguised attack in the Magistrates Court, openly and repeatedly attacked and abused by a deeply biased Magistrate White in an un-ambiguous Pro-Paedophile Political Persecution, a Political Persecution motivated by this 'ere blog, but more directly, motivated by the St Martins Lutheran School Child Abuse Cover-up...and it ain't Contempt of Court for me to write this stuff about my 'Trial' because I've said it a dozen times over in 'Open Court', and it's been reported previous, eg, the issues of Bias raised in March 2017, etc...\n\nAs previously posted, I've had some doozies for sure, but last week was arguably the most stressfully bizarre week that I've ever experienced, certainly with regard to this endlessly bizarre 'Trial' process... \n\nPlease find attached the article from The Border Watch , Tuesday 28th November 2017...it's not bad compared to the highly erroneous reportage from the ABC South East Radio that same morning, quoting me as saying my 'Trial' was \"tyrannical\" and that I 'threatened to take my case to the High Court', but I never actually said 'tyrannical' and I repeatedly stated that I had already referred myself and/or my bizarre 'Trial' to the High Court... TBW has in contrast, been reasonably accurate, but unfortunately there are still critical omissions...\n\n\nMr Fletcher refused to participate because my former/second Magistrate, Her Honour Teresa Anderson, HH Anderson specifically 'Ordered' that SAPol (police) Prosecutions find out about and attempt to resolve the Constitutional Law Issues, as specifically identified in the Magistrate Court's own Certificate of Record...HH Anderson made that 'Order' aways away back in February 2016 after the 'new' SAPol Prosecutor Ms Diamandi stated in Court that a 'Special Meeting of all State's Attorneys-General is required prior to any Trial beginning, in case the outcome compromises Constitutional Law' ...( as others keep asking you, how do you know this stuff? you ain't a lawyer or a journo or nuthin' like that,  yet you know all this Constitutional Law stuff -Ed)...well sure, but like I just said, it ain't nuthin' to do with me knowin' whatevs about whatevs, I know this stuff because it was identified and explained to me (and the Court) by SAPol Prosecutions in that February 2016 'hearing'...( cleverrr- Ed)...what, being forced to show-up in Court and then told this stuff? how is that being clever?...( just sayin' mate, just sayin' -Ed)...yep, sure, sorry mate, just that after more than 3 years of watching 'the Court' repeatedly reference/acknowledge but then all but ignore the Constitutional Law issues, it gets a tad frustrating...( 'a tad'? wow, what's the opposite of hyperbole? -Ed)...\n\nAnd just for the record, here t'is from the Certificate of Record, Magistrate Anderson's 'Order' to SAPol Prosecutions to resolve the Constitutional Law Issues...\n     02/02/16 11.30am Hearing MAGISTRATES COURT OF SA MOUNT GAMBIER\n       Pros undertakes to contact Mr Bonig who appeared last occasion in an attempt to see\n       the actual constitutional issue so the relevant Attorney General's can be notified.\n                       *('Order' 4 of 4)*\n...this of course refers to a long discussion across the various Constitutional Law Issues, but it clearly identifies 1) that 'Pros' (SAPol Prosecutions) were aware of what it is they are being 'Ordered' to do, and particularly 2) the involvement of the Attorneys-General...\n\nIt is my recollection that I even read this-out in Court (27/11/17), and yet Magistrate White completely refused to even acknowledge it, only responding with his enquiry about an 'Action Number' for my self-referral to the High Court...as I explained, I've only just contacted the High Court and am still in the process of following their response/advise to re-submit via the appropriate channels with appropriate paperwork, etc...Magistrate White then returned to completely ignoring all of the actual Constitutional Law Issues, including the multiple other references in the Certificate of Record...\n\nMagistrate White refused to acknowledge the Unchallengeable Reality that my 'Trial' was moved to Adelaide in June/July 2015 because SAPol Prosecutions and 'the Court' agreed with the SE Community Legal Service who were representing/helping me at that time, they all discussed and agreed that it would be necessary to address this very convoluted piece of legislation, the SA ICAC Act 2012, and the impending Constitutional Law Issues, in 'a bigger Court in Adelaide because it would require numerous Constitutional lawyers', etc, to sort it all out...again, this is writ-large in the Certificate of Record, and Magistrate White refused to even look at it when I repeatedly requested,\n     \"Why won't you look at your own Record right there in front of you?\"         \n\nMr Fletcher continually talked-over Magistrate White because Magistrate White flatly refused to even acknowledge that 'Order' by HH Magistrate Anderson, and flatly refused Fletcher's repeated request to pick-up the Certificate that was right there in front of him and read the damn thing!...( you didn't say 'damn'?! -Ed)..well no, not quite, but it got pretty heated...( I bet!- Ed)...Magistrate White deliberately refused to acknowledge what was right there in front of him in his own Court's 'Orders'... it was an extraordinary display of wilful ignorance motivated by gross bias against me, from a supposedly independent Magistrate ...not just once or twice, Magistrate White repeatedly flatly refused to even acknowledge Magistrate Anderson's 'Order'...\n\nMagistrate White also completely ignored my repeated observations/accusations that SAPol's failure to follow that direct 'Order' by HH Anderson constituted 'Contempt of Court', and that if I'd just ignored such an 'Order' I'd be in all sorts...( of trouble? -Ed)...yeah yeah...( you're in twubble mister! -Ed)...well yes and no, in that I've never been in any such trouble re Contempt of Court because I'd always done exactly what was asked of me, or at least genuinely tried, etc...( it's kinda' ironic for you to be accused of thinking you run the 'Trial', when you've done far more of it than anyone else, Magistrate White included! -Ed)...oh yeah, including successfully arguing for Summons for Info from ICAC Commissioner Bruce Lander, SAPol Comm Grant Stevens, and the ABC (Sydney HQ), all for info that should have already been provided as part of a 'normal Trial' process...( what a joke! -Ed)...farcically laughable...\n\n( And what was that response from the ICAC and the ABC? -Ed)...oh it's all too difficult mate, my Summons for info were/are apparently \"oppressive\" and \"fishing for information\", and between them they provided exactly zero documents to support/explain; \n  1) ICAC Comm Lander's personal and unilateral decision to have me 'prosecuted' by SAPol; or\n  2) Stuart Stansfield's (SE ABC) extraordinary Affidavit where-in he claims that I've been written\n      to in January 2014 and told that I'm 'banned from the ABC' because I'm such a problem.  \n\nIt's All About The Context, I Said :...'cos this is the stuff that was being 'discussed' when Magistrate White talked-over me and called SAPol Det Gardner to the witness box...( but isn't she away on 'Open-Ended Sick Leave', unable to continue her lie-riddled testimony/evidence under your very cross Cross-Examination from 'Trial' aways back in March 2017? -Ed)...well exactly Ed, and as I indicated to Magistrate White, who again just ignored me...I repeatedly identified his own 'Orders' from 19th July 2017 where-in he 'Orders' this;\n     19/07/17 9:30am Hearing MAGISTRATES COURT OF SA ADELAIDE \n       Prosecution to provide an update of the witness's health via email by 8/9/17. \n\nNone of this exchange is mentioned in The Border Watch , but it does note that I identified, albeit somewhat sarcastically at that early stage, that I was already feeling unwell coming into the 'Trial' and identified my Disability Support Pension/Agoraphobia/Stress stuff as it related to the Health Absences of himself and Det Gardner...repeatedly through-out the hearing I identified this stuff and how I was struggling, etc, but Magistrate White all-but ignored me, in this instance also ignoring my protests that this witness wasn't even meant to be here, as identified in his own 'Orders', which he was simultaneously ignoring, etc, and that I had therefore done no prep for them, at all, and had only prepared for the other 3 identified witnesses, my single witness, and closing arguments, etc... \n\nIt was in this circumstance/context that Magistrate White started 'counting-down' at me...it was immediately following this heated exchange where-in Magistrate White was clearly complicit in this very deliberate, rankly deceitful and ineptly transparent attempt by SAPol Prosecutions to try and trick me and undermine my Cross-Examination of their woefully incompetent liar of a Chief Investigator and Chief Witness, Det Gardner, by forcing her on me knowing full-well that I wasn't expecting her at all, etc...and the complicit nature of Magistrate White's involvement is self-evident, namely, he not only allowed it to happen in the first instance, but then he completely ignored me when I identified this, but most extraordinarily, he also refused to acknowledged his own 'Order' as above...\n\nAnd Fletcher was talking about all these issues...( it was the Constitution, it was the In-Appropriate Witness Trickery, it wasn't Mabo, but it was your Health, etc, etc- Ed)...yep, all that, and Magistrate White just kept-on ignoring me and all of my absolutely valid inquiries/questions/accusations, and called in Det Gardner, and in she came with that sly, smug smirk on her face, and I was thinkin', 'here we go, get in the dodgy witness with carefully rehearsed changes to her evidence from March 2017, and shove it all through by trying to trick me', and I was exactly right...Magistrate White stated that if I didn't show-up at 1415hrs after the adjournment, and/or didn't ask any questions of Det Gardner, that they'd continue without me...( charming! -Ed)...ain't it though...\n\nAs reported, Magistrate White repeatedly stated that he was resuming the 'Trial' regardless, with Det Gardner as the witness, and he actually stated, 'this Trial will be ending this week'...( what?! how can he say that? that's absolutely outrageous! -Ed)...I know, I know...( how can he possibly say when this extraordinary 'Trial' will potentially end? -Ed)...indeed...( after 3 bizarre years of multiple adjournments, Health Absences, etc, and with at least 5 witnesses yet to be called, and your own evidence to be given, and you to give your own version/self-Cross-Examination/whatevs, and final summing-up/submissions, etc, how can anyone say when the shreck it's gunna' finish? -Ed)...that's what I said in Court, surely it takes as long as it takes...( absolutely, to put an end-date on it completely compromises a Defendants right to a Fair Trial , let-alone in this bizarrely bloated proceedings- Ed)...spot on, this 'it will be ending this week' statement shows a clear bias against me and clearly compromises my supposed right to a Fair Trial...\n\nChanging Of The Mind :..'cos, to completely contradict his own outrageous 'fixed timetable', just before adjournment on Tuesday 28th November, even Magistrate White started to question his own statement about 'ending this week', when he observed that with so many witnesses left, at least 3, and then all the rest of it still to go, he actually conceded that 'the Trial may well go past the end of the week'...( wow -Ed)...yeah, I know, it's pretty much where I gave-up, if not entirely or already, etc, but at that point, after the extraordinary Magistrate White tirades I'd already been subjected to, the stuff about how I was 'delaying murder investigations', etc, his repeated self-contradictions, and faced with 3 more full days of that abuse and/or contradiction, those were all critical issues in my ultimate capitulation approx 0400hrs Wednesday 29th November 2017...  \n\nBut back to the Monday, and with all of this extraordinary lead-in, and with Fletcher still profusely protesting, Magistrate White actually started counting-down the seconds at Fletcher, repeatedly, and as reported, threatened/forced Fletcher to ask a question of this witness whom Magistrate White knew was supposedly still on Sick Leave and should not be there at all, let-alone in the Witness Box... I was quite literally forced to ask a question, under absolute duress and whilst being subjected to harassment and abuse and threats from Magistrate White ...it is an absolute outrage that a Magistrate would conduct themselves in this disgraceful manner, and completely trounces any pre-conceived ideas of a Defendant's 'Right to a Fair Trial'...( let alone a Defendant forced to self-represent -Ed)...well indeed...\n\nAnd my first forced question to Det Gardner, with only seconds to go 'who ordered you to raid my home in May 2014'?', and there immediately is the rehearsed lie, completely contradicting her woefully inept and deceitful testimony from the March 2017 'Trial' dates...in March it was mumbling and stuttering, 'err, I dunno', nuthin' written down, probably my boss Baulderstone', and last week it was straight into it without a moments hesitation, 'well, as Chief Investigator I make those decisions'...( but that's an absolute lie! -Ed)...yeah, that's what I'm saying, the whole thing was an absolute SAPol set-up, committed with Magistrate White's complicit blessing, a SAPol set-up to undermine my ability to properly Cross-Examine this rankly deceitful SAPol witness...\n\nDet Gardner was only a few seconds into this lie when I called her on it, stating to Magistrate White the Undeniable Reality that this was a much-repeated pattern of deceitful conduct by SAPol Prosecutions, constantly changing/modifying/re-wording their arguments and/or 'Charge Sheet' and/or witness statements/evidence, etc, etc, on and on, over and over, hearing after hearing, adjournment upon adjournment, for 3 years, whilst they incompetently try to cobble together some sort of case against me...the entire process has been farcical...\n\nMagistrate White stopped me and sent Det Gardner out again, and then promptly changed his mind, saying something about how it was not his 'preferred' option, but excusing Det Gardner from giving further evidence, and calling another brief adjournment until 1510hrs when we were going to start with the ICAC/SAPol witnesses, a directive accompanied with further 'or else' statements from Magistrate White...and that happened, we went on from 1510hrs, but that's a story for tomorrow, etc, and we adjourned for the day at 1630hrs...\n\nTomorrow: More Stuff  \n\nUber-Cheers again for the feedback/support this past few weeks, and I'm just stoked that I've recovered so well 'Mentally' if not quite yet 'Physically' from this extraordinary week, but it's all clearly a long, long way from over...and even if I'm being left no choice, I guarantee it...\n\nI am Nick Fletcher and it ain't about The Vibe, it ain't about Mabo, it ain't even apparently about the Constitution, it is apparently all about me and this 'ere blog, my blog, The Mount Gambier Independent...cheers and laters...

Meta Viers McClatchy Wildfire destroys mobile homes in California retirement park By ELIOT SPAGAT and AMANDA LEE MYERS Associated Press December 07, 2017 05:42 PM UPDATED 2 MINUTES AGO SAN DIEGO \nA brush fire driven by gusty winds that have plagued Southern California all week exploded rapidly Thursday and destroyed dozens of trailer homes in a retirement community north of San Diego. \nThe fire expanded to 4 square miles (10 square kilometers) in a matter of hours and tore through the tightly packed Rancho Monserate Country Club community in the small city of Fallbrook, known for its avocado orchards and horse ranches. At least two people were hospitalized with burns. \nThe destructive blaze broke out as firefighters were trying to corral major wildfires around the Los Angeles area and 130 miles (209 kilometers) north near Ventura, where a massive fire threatened Ojai, a scenic mountain town dubbed \"Shangri-La\" and known for its boutique hotels and New Age spiritual retreats. \nLike other fires that have broken out this week, Fallbrook has a history of destructive blazes. Ten years ago, as fall fires raced across Southern California, a blaze in Fallbrook injured five people, destroyed 206 homes and burned 14 square miles (36 square kilometers).   \nThursday's fire prompted closure of state Highway 76 in both directions and evacuations in an area near the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base.

IMAGE: Team India after winning the series 1-0. Photograph: BCCI India were expected to streamroll Sri Lanka, but in the end the World No 1 Test team had to be satisfied with a 1-0 series win. \nThe islanders, fielding a relatively inexperienced team, showed great determination to bat the whole of Day 5 and force a draw in the final Test in Delhi. \nIndia nearly staged a brilliant come-from-behind win in the rain-hit Test in Kolkata before they routed Sri Lanka in the Nagpur Test by an innings and 239 runs. \nIt was the Virat Kohli show once again as he continued his golden run with the bat, hitting three centuries in a row, including back to back double centuries. \nMurali Vijay, Cheteshwar Pujara and Rohit Sharma also made merry, but it was a forgettable series for Ajinkya Rahane, \nVirat Kohli 10/10 IMAGE: Virat celebrates his century in Kolkata. Photograph: BCCI Virat made the most of playing against a mediocre Sri Lankan attack as he amassed a mighty 600-plus runs in the series. \nThe India captain led from the front with centuries in all three games, including back to back double hundreds. \nAfter being dismissed for a duck in the first innings in Kolkata, Virat stormed back with scores of 104 not out, 213, 243 and 50. \nHe finished with 610 runs at an average of 152 coupled with an impressive strike rate of 82, the most by an Indian batsman in a three Test series and the fourth highest overall in Tests. \nIndia registered a world record nine series wins in a row. \nIt was not only about scoring runs for Kohli but the manner in which he scored that impressed everyone. He looked to assert himself with the bat as he not only scored the hundreds and double hundreds, but got them at a quick rate. \nVirat set quite a few records in the series including the most double centuries by a captain -- six, as he went past the legendary Brian Lara, who had five double tons as West Indies skipper. \nCheteshwar Pujara (9/10) IMAGE: Cheteshwar Pujara celebrates another century during the Nagpur Test. Photograph: BCCI 'Chottu' continues to be the rock of India's batting. \nHe lived up to his billing with a century and half-century in the series for a tally of 289 runs in the three games. \nHe saved India the blushes on the opening day in Kolkata on a difficult wicket with a fighting knock of 52. \nChottu is the leading run getter in Tests in 2017 with 1,140 runs in 11 games and no doubt holds the key to India's fortunes in South Africa. \nAjinkya Rahane (2/10) IMAGE: Dasun Shanaka celebrates Ajinkya Rahane's wicket in Kolkata. Photograph: BCCI 'Jinks' had another poor showing in a home series. \nThe India vice-captain scored just 17 runs in five innings. Only once did he manage to get to double digits. \nJinks has the best record in the present Indian team overseas and we believe he will erase this series memory in South Africa with some match-winning scores. \nMurali Vijay (9/10) IMAGE: Murali Vijay hit a century after returning to the Indian team in Nagpur. Photograph: BCCI Murali Vijay rightly earned his spot as India's No 1 opener with back to back centuries in the last two Tests. \nAfter being dropped for the first Test as India went in with the in-form duo of K L Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan, Vijay made it back after the latter took a break from the second game. \nUnder pressure Vijay made the most of the opportunity as he scored 128 classy runs. \nAt the Ferozeshah Kotla, Vijay scored an elegant 155 and ended the series with 292 runs in two games. \nShikhar Dhawan (8/10) IMAGE: Shikhar Dhawan hits out. Photograph: BCCI Shikhar is one of the few Indian players who feature in all three formats. \nAnd his impact at the top of the order is quite telling as he consistently comes up with big knocks. \nIn the first Test, he hit a quickfire 94 to lead India's superb turnaround before Sri Lanka escaped with a draw late on Day 5. \nHe hit a swift 67 in the second innings in Delhi and tallied 192 runs for the series. \nK L Rahul (7/10) IMAGE: K L Rahul hit a ninth half-century in the Eden Gardens Test. Photograph: BCCI The young opener had a superb run of eight half-centuries in nine innings before he failed in the only innings he played in Nagpur and was promptly dropped for the Delhi game. \nRahul -- who scored 79 in Kolkata -- needs to convert half-centuries into big knocks if he has to seal his place in the side. \nBy his standards, his 86 runs in three innings at an average of 28 is not par for the course. \nRohit Sharma (8/10) IMAGE: A jubilant Rohit Sharma after hitting a century in Nagpur. Photograph: BCCI Rohit has enjoyed Virat's backing as far as his Test career is concerned. \nHe didn't disappoint after he was presented another opportunity to resurrect his Test career. \nRohit announced his comeback with a fine 102 not out in the Nagpur Test and followed it up with twin half-centuries in Delhi. \nRohit will a key options in the middle order in South Africa. \nHe finished with a magical average of 217 in the series after being dismissed just once. \nWriddhiman Saha (6/10) IMAGE: Wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha. Photograph: BCCI With the bat, Wriddhiman Saha didn't have much to do with the top and middle order among the runs. \nW lived up to expectations with the gloves taking nine catches, rock solid against both pace and spin. \nThese days, W comes in after Ravichandran Ashwin and sometimes Ravindra Jadeja, so for now India is primarily looking at his 'keeping more than his batting. \nRavichandran Ashwin (6/10) IMAGE: Ravichandran Ashwin takes a wicket. Photograph: BCCI Ashwin was the highest wicket-taker in the series with 12 wickets, but he was not at his best. \nAshwin, who usually runs through batting line-ups in home Tests, was not used much in the rain-hit first Test. But he came up with a strong showing in the second Test, picking up 4 wickets in each innings which saw him became the fastest to get to 300 wickets in Test cricket. \nHowever, he struggled in the second innings of the Delhi Test when India's bowlers needed to bowl out the inexperienced Sri Lankans on a fifth day wicket. \nWith the bat, Ashwin managed just 20 runs in four innings. \nRavindra Jadeja (7/10) IMAGE: Ravindra Jadeja celebrates a wicket. Photograph: BCCI 'Sir Ravindra' bowled his heart out on the final day of the Delhi Test, creating quite a few chances on a placid fifth day wicket. \nThe left=arm spinner took 5 wickets each in the second and third Tests to finish with 10 wickets at an average of 25 compared to Ashwin's average of 29. \nHe scored just 40 runs in four innings. \nMohammed Shami (8/10) IMAGE: Mohammed Shami, centre, takes a wicket. Photograph: BCCI Shami showed why he is such a potent threat when fully fit. \nHe bowled an excellent spell in the Kolkata Test, claiming 6 wickets in all, but fitness issues ensured he missed the Nagpur game. \nShami came back for the Delhi Test and picked up three wickets, but was largely ineffective on Day 5. He finished the series with 9 wickets. \nIndia will need to wrap Shami in cotton wool for the next few weeks and ensure he is at his best shape in South Africa. \nIshant Sharma (7/10) IMAGE: Ishant Sharma, left, was at his sharpest in Nagpur. Photograph: BCCI Ishant bowled a lot in this year's Ranji Trophy and made an immediate impact when called up to the Test team. \nReplacing Bhuvneshwar Kumar who opted out after the first Test to get married, Ishant gave a fine account of himself. \nIndia's most experienced Test player took 5 five wickets in the Nagpur Test before taking another 3 in Delhi. \nAlas, he too failed to make an impression on the fifth day at the Ferozeshah Kotla. \nUmesh Yadav (4/10) IMAGE: Umesh Yadav in action. Photograph: BCCI Umesh struggled in the two Tests he played and lost his place for the third game. \nIn Kolkata on a helpful wicket, Umesh took just 3 wickets. \nHe bagged another 2 wickets at his home ground in Nagpur. \nBhuvneshwar Kumar (8/10) IMAGE: Bhuvneshwar Kumar was deadly in the second innings in Kolkata. Photograph: BCCI Bhuvi is another important player who features in all three formats for India. \nHe made most of the conditions to take 8 wickets in Kolkata, bowling with guile in the Sri Lankan second innings. \nHaving added a yard of pace, Bhuvi will be very handy in South African conditions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

But this drug kills cancer, too, study finds", "text": "December 06, 2017 04:26 PM UPDATED 9 HOURS 5 MINUTES AGO \nFor years, the drug has been given to alcoholics. \nIf alcoholics drink even a little liquor after taking disulfiram (commercially sold as Antabuse) a tidal wave of unpleasant symptoms will wash over them: Everything from throbbing head pain to vomiting, from chest pain to anxiety. Even choking could result, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, with symptoms starting to crop up within 10 minutes of drinking. \nSo while disulfiram can\u2019t cure alcoholism, the drug works by making even a drop of alcohol hurt \u2014 which hopefully discourages drinking. \nBut now, scientists say the drug has another promising use: Cancer fighting.   \nDisulfiram cut the risk of death in a host of Danish patients suffering from colon, prostate and breast tumors , according to a new study published Dec. 6 in the scientific journal Nature. That means the drug could have a promising second life as a cancer fighter, researchers said. \nThe researchers demonstrated the link between disulfiram and cancer by comparing two groups of people. First, the researchers looked at patients who kept using disulfiram after they were diagnosed with cancer. Then, they compared that group with patients who stopped using the anti-drinking drug after they were diagnosed, researchers said. \nWhat researchers found was that those who kept using the drug after their cancer diagnosis cut their risk of death 34 percent , Science Magazine reports. \nJiri Bartek of the Danish Cancer Society Research Center in Copenhagen authored the Nature study. He and his fellow researchers examined the medical histories of cancer patients throughout Denmark to complete the research, according to the study. \nJust as important, researchers were able to pinpoint the exact molecule that the drug operates on to effectively fight cancer: The scientists found that in mice, the anti-drinking drug immobilized NPL4\u2013p97, a natural protein grouping that boosts the growth of tumors, according to the study. \nBut if you can immobilize that protein group, researchers found, you can help kill the cancer cells. That\u2019s exactly what disulfiram does, researchers said. \nScientists first discovered the link between disulfiram and cancer in the 1970s, Science Magazine reports, but until now it hadn\u2019t gotten much attention \u2014 in part because no one was quite sure how the drug was working. \n\u201cThis paper solves a puzzle that has persisted in cancer research for decades,\u201d cancer biologist Michele Pagano, a cancer biologist at New York University who was not involved in the study, told Science Magazine . \nSo is there hope for redesigning the drug for cancer treatments? \nIt\u2019s a good question, but it\u2019s complicated. \n\u201cBig pharma probably won\u2019t be interested,\u201d study author Bartek told Science Magazine, explaining that there\u2019s no patent protection for the relatively old drug \u2014 meaning that pharmaceutical companies couldn\u2019t cash in on developing a new use for it. \nBut that doesn\u2019t meant that doctors couldn\u2019t start using it as a relatively cheap treatment for cancers, Science Magazine reports. \nOther research this year has also pointed to the anti-drinking drug as a promising cancer-fighting alternative. \nResearching lung cancer patients for a study published in October, scientists at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland found that disulfiram cut down tumor cell growth while also killing lung cancer stem cells. \nIrish researchers pointed to disulfiram as a way to supplement traditional chemotherapy, because the study showed combining the two therapies was significantly more effective at tackling lung cancer that chemotherapy alone \nResearchers pointed out that repurposing older, existing drugs has many advantages. \n\u201cThe development of novel anti-cancer drugs against various malignant tumours is both time-consuming and expensive and involves pre-clinical and clinical testing,\u201d said Dr. Lauren MacDonagh, who carried out the study, in a statement. \u201cFinding new uses for existing drugs, otherwise known as \u2018repurposing\u2019, may allow for new uses of an old drug that may lead to the discovery of new treatments.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lauren macdonagh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jiri bartek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bartek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michele pagano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. department of health and human services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trinity college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "science magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danish cancer society research center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "copenhagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:48:05.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b7969ee08bc3f9ff8bf14ccff71f75ad25c7bca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8zn7ILWqJzjl9TBeMYcoUh5PWLq.pGU9bsIHkz9G_7VKcuR4x9gmXY8ZJF5xXAE1S2ZbTPkyGnhfvYfsUQms.M_n7klMB8smvVsHFTPFfKbg--", "site_full": "www.bellinghamherald.com", "site": "bellinghamherald.com", "site_section": "http://www.bellinghamherald.com/news/nation-world/?widgetName=rssfeed&widgetContentId=712015&getXmlFeed=true", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nation & World News | BellinghamHerald.com &", "title": "Audit: Kentucky public workers took paid leave, didn't vote", "title_full": "Audit: Kentucky public workers took paid leave, didn't vote", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//www.bellinghamherald.com/static/images/bellinghamherald/facebook.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 68396, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b7969ee08bc3f9ff8bf14ccff71f75ad25c7bca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8zn7ILWqJzjl9TBeMYcoUh5PWLq.pGU9bsIHkz9G_7VKcuR4x9gmXY8ZJF5xXAE1S2ZbTPkyGnhfvYfsUQms.M_n7klMB8smvVsHFTPFfKbg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Associated Press", "published": "2017-12-07T11:42:00.000+02:00", "title": "Audit: Kentucky public workers took paid leave, didn't vote", "text": "December 07, 2017 01:41 AM UPDATED 3 MINUTES AGO FRANKFORT, Ky. \nAn audit has found that more than 1,100 public employees claimed leave to vote in Kentucky elections, but did not cast a ballot. \nState Auditor Mike Harmon said in a statement that his office reviewed the use of election leave during the 2015 general election and the 2016 primary election.

Very carefully. \nUncle Tim doesn\u2019t get along with Aunt Sally, so they can\u2019t sit together. Cousin Jeff is old enough for the Adult Table now; you\u2019re tempted to put Grandpa at the Kids\u2019 Table and there\u2019s a moratorium on politics. So before you sit down this holiday, imagine spending a whole week like this, and read \u201cSeven Days of Us\u201d by Francesca Hornak (c.2017, Berkley, $26, 358 pages). \nThe No-Touch rule was in place for a reason. \nOlivia Birch knew it and so did her beloved, Sean; they were both doctors, for heaven\u2019s sake! They knew the risks of the deadly Haag Virus. They\u2019d taken precautions in their time at the Liberian medical camp and as soon as their final quarantine was over \u2013 his, in Ireland; hers, at her mother\u2019s family home near London \u2013 they\u2019d be free to be a couple. \nAndrew Birch missed his eldest daughter \u2013 it\u2019d been years since Olivia\u2019s last trip home \u2013 but he sometimes felt like he really didn\u2019t know her. His younger daughter, Phoebe, was a different story: she was often his dinner companion when he was reviewing restaurants for the newspaper, and Andrew valued Phoebe\u2019s opinion and her insights. He knew that after her wedding, he\u2019d feel a little bit lost. \nPhoebe wasn\u2019t happy about the upcoming quarantine. She\u2019d have to be away from her intended, George, for seven days, but that seemed oddly appealing. The confinement itself, though, made her want to squirm. \nAt last, her entire family, including both daughters, would be together for the holidays, but Emma Birch\u2019s excitement was also fearful: this first-in-awhile Christmas might be their last. Just before quarantine, Emma learned that the lump she\u2019d found was cancerous but couldn\u2019t the news wait? Why ruin everyone\u2019s Christmas? \nGrowing up in Iowa , Jesse Robinson definitely stood out \u2013 not because he was gay but because he was dark-haired, dark-eyed-exotic. He wasn\u2019t sure which birth parent he\u2019d gotten the swarthiness from but he\u2019d learn soon: he\u2019d found his birth father online, and the man lived in London. So Jesse booked a ticket \u2026 \nHere\u2019s a Christmas surprise: \u201cSeven Days of Us\u201d is not a comedy. \nOh, sure, there are chuckles sprinkled like cookie decorations here and there, but this is more a book about family and the magnification of secrets we keep from them. It\u2019s the kind of story that lets readers in on the character\u2019s foibles early, but takes its time in letting them sort things out while author Francesca Hornak tosses a few wrenches into the mix to make things interesting and even a little madcap at times. You might also note that the setting \u2013 a drafty, dusty old manor \u2013 turns out to be a perfect place to tell this tale and yes, you might catch the ending early, but don\u2019t cheat and peek. \nSo make your arrangements around the table.
