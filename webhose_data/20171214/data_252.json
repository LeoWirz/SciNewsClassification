All six Vineyard towns, plus Gosnold on the Elizabeth Islands, subsidized the annual costs, based on real estate values and county assessments. In 2010, the state assumed financial responsibility for the sheriff\u2019s office, and the towns stopped paying. The center has been flat-funded ever since, according to Mr. Ogden. \nThe deficit is bleeding into its ability to sustain infrastructure, employees, and maintenance management of the system, Sheriff Ogden said. \n\u201cAlmost a quarter of our dispatches are through Edgartown\u2019s fire and police,\u201d Mr. Ogden said. \u201cSo we\u2019re here to seek support from the town, and possibly present it to your townspeople for discussion on the warrant article.\u201d \nFor the 2019 fiscal year, the sheriff is requesting about $185,000 from the town of Edgartown, $199,000 from Oak Bluffs, $155,000 from Vineyard Haven, and less than $80,000 from the other three up-Island towns. It is requesting $231 from Gosnold, for a grand total of about $670,000 from the county\u2019s towns. \nMassachusetts recognizes the sheriff\u2019s department as a house of corrections, and pays it a general appropriation that the department then decides how to distribute annually, according to Sheriff Ogden. \nAccording to Sheriff Ogden, the state doesn\u2019t recognize all the regional services the sheriff\u2019s department provides. It also oversees jail and lockup service, emergency communication, public safety services such as beach, bike, and boat patrol, court order mandates, civil processes, and drug prevention education in schools. \n\u201cWe can pay for the house of correction, we can somewhat pay for jail and lockup, but when it comes to paying for everything that runs the communication center, we simply cannot do it,\u201d Sheriff Ogden said. \nSelectmen chairman Arthur Smadbeck questioned the amount the department was asking for from the county, referencing past years, before the department was taken over by the state, when the county paid less annually than what the sheriff\u2019s department is asking for in 2019. \n\u201cThe call volume increased,\u201d Sheriff Ogden responded. \u201cThe obligation to the regional emergency communication center has increased, and this is what we\u2019ve seen as an obligation to the town through dispatch. We\u2019re not making up the call volume; it\u2019s there for you to see.\u201d \nAccording to the warrant article request, throughout the state, three other regional communication emergency centers are also run by their sheriff\u2019s offices \u2014 Barnstable, Berkshire, and Essex. Dukes is the only county that doesn\u2019t receive funding from participating communities. \n\u201cWe\u2019re not unique in coming and requesting assessments from the towns,\u201d Sheriff Ogden told selectmen. \n\u201cBut it\u2019s unique for us, because it\u2019s new,\u201d Mr. Smadbeck replied. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the problem I\u2019m struggling with. The fact that previous administrations weren\u2019t asking for it indicates we don\u2019t need it.\u201d \nSheriff Ogden took office in January 2016, replacing longtime Dukes County Sheriff Michael McCormack. Sheriff Ogden said the previous administration didn\u2019t put money into infrastructure, which is now outdated, and that\u2019s why the funds are needed. \n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s on the backs of the three down-Island towns,\u201d town administrator Pam Dolby said. \u201cIt\u2019s a service that every town needs, every fire department, and every police department. And the amount you\u2019re asking for from Edgartown is substantial, especially this year. We have a lot of articles we\u2019re looking at.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s not about dollars and cents,\u201d Sheriff Ogden said. \u201cIt\u2019s about public safety. It\u2019s about supporting our community. That\u2019s why we were elected into these positions. If we don\u2019t pay for this and the system fails, I will ask you why.\u201d \nAccording to Sheriff Ogden, all town radio sites need an overhaul, and their business-grade system doesn\u2019t support public safety. \n\u201cWe\u2019re using products that are insufficient, identified by key stakeholders, not only on-Island, but specific consultants we brought in from off-Island,\u201d Mr. Ogden said. \nAccording to Mr. Ogden, the state recognizes that Martha\u2019s Vineyard has a structural, technological, and operability deficit, and will support them with grant projects, but they have to wait in line with everybody else. \n\u201cThey suggested the lag time would be anywhere from 5 to 10 years. We can\u2019t wait that long,\u201d Sheriff Ogden said. \u201cSo what do we do until we get that money?\u201d \n\u201cA good question,\u201d Mr. Smadbeck replied. \nIn other business, selectmen heard from Paul Pimentel seeking a letter of support on behalf of Vineyard Wind. The offshore wind farm about 15 miles south of Martha\u2019s Vineyard is one of three under consideration, along with Bay State Wind and Deepwater Wind. Proposals are due Dec. 20. \nMr. Pimentel, who is also a board member for Vineyard Power, a partner of Vineyard Wind, said Vineyard Wind has the Island\u2019s best interests in mind. The group has met with nearly 100 fishermen and related stakeholders to make sure all industries can thrive through shared and sustainable use of the ocean\u2019s resources. Mr. Pimentel also said Vineyard Wind will provide long-term employment to dozens of individuals, and the company is already working with Island housing to come up with affordable solutions for new hires. \nThe board said it would refer the request to the marine advisory and shellfish committees to get their opinions. \nIn a tax-rate hearing, selectmen heard from board of assessors chairman Alan Gowell. The tax classification for the town of Edgartown will remain at one residential rate for every property, treating residential, commercial, and industrial properties equally. The tax rate will go up from $3.55 per thousand to $3.87 per thousand, a 32\u00a2, or 9 percent, increase. \n\u201cThe value of our small colonial New England town this year is worth $8.2 billion,\u201d Mr. Gowell said.

The Commission wants to transform the ESM, which currently is controlled by Eurozone finance minister and national parliament, into an EU institution, claiming, \u201cThe structures for the provision of financial support [to Eurozone member states] are best place in the hands of an institution of the [European] Union.\u201d The Commission paper argues that \u201cthe coexistence of EU institutions and a permanent intergovernmental mechanism such as the EMF\u201d leads to an \u201cunbalanced\u201d situation with lengthy procedures and a lack of transparency and democratic legitimacy. \nThe Commission further proposes to grant the EMF the right to lend money to banks. Under current rules, banks can only receive ESM funds through their respective national governments. Also a \u201cstabilisation function\u201d is included in the proposal, which would enable the EMF to grant additional support to member states during economic crises. \nGerman acting Finance Minister Peter Altmaier commented, \u201cWe will examine these proposals very thoroughly, constructively and self-confidently,\u201d adding there would be no need for concrete decisions on the proposals for some months. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel responded more positively, calling the proposals \u201cthe right direction\u201d and warning, \u201cThe attempt to sit out this great need for reforms is na\u00efve and outright dangerous for the European project.\u201d Source: Handelsblatt Pharmaceutical companies to invest in UK \nMore than two dozen global pharmaceutical companies are pledging to invest in the UK as part of a multi-billion-pound effort to spur the country\u2019s health-care industry, Bloomberg reports. This comes as the government announced yesterday that the UK\u2019s two largest drug makers will invest in new research projects as part of a push to make the UK a more attractive investment destination after it leaves the EU. GlaxoSmithKline Plc\u2019s president of research and development, Patrick Vallance, has argued that boosting the strength of the UK\u2019s universities and research will be crucial to reinforcing the country\u2019s life-science sector. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for countries to build a strong academic base and science base quickly,\u201d and warned, \u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s quite easy to lose it quickly if you don\u2019t get it right.\u201d According to Bloomberg, agreements in the construction, artificial intelligence and automotive industries are also well under way as the government is aiming to restore certainty to the economy. Source: Bloomberg Germans see future of defence in Europe, poll suggests \nA new poll by the Koerber Stiftung suggests strong German support for increased defence integration in Europe. Asked which partnership Germany should prioritise for its defence policy, 88 percent opted for \u201cEuropean states\u201d, and just 9 percent for the US. The idea of a \u201ccommon European army\u201d is supported by 58 percent of respondents, with 38 percent deeming the idea undesirable. Meanwhile, 31 percent of Germans think their country should spend more on defence, and just 41 percent would like to see Germany become more involved in international crises. Source: Koerber Stiftung Leopold Traugott: German Social Democrats present their EU wish list \nIn a blog piece , Open Europe\u2019s Leopold Traugott argues that the German Social Democrats (SPD) have put a heavy price tag on their support for another Merkel-led government. The SPD, which earlier this week backtracked from its initial rejection of another coalition, \u201cwas quick to follow up with a long list of demands [\u2026] To make sure his U-turn did not just look like a sellout.\u201d The SPD \u201cdemands a lot from the [Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative] CDU and [her Bavarian sister party] CSU \u2013 not only on domestic reforms, but also at the EU level. It strikes a decisively pro-European tone, and takes up many of the reforms French President Emmanuel Macron outlined in his Sorbonne speech in September.\u201c Traugott explains that the position paper \u201dtakes up Macron\u2019s idea of introducing a \u2018system of European minimum wages\u2019 (which in the mid-term would likely remain adjusted to different national economies), and seeks to combat tax havens \u2018inside and outside the EU\u2019. To achieve the latter, it identifies \u2018the harmonisation of corporate taxes at the European level\u2019 as the only way to \u2018stop the tax avoidance schemes of major international corporations [\u2026] On Eurozone reform, the [SPD\u2019s position] paper is largely sympathetic to the proposals coming from Paris. While it is quiet on the matter of a Eurozone finance minister, it stresses that Germany \u2018must, together with France, take the initiative on an investment budget for the Eurozone\u2019. The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is to be transformed into a European Monetary Fund (EMF), and put under parliamentary control [\u2026] For all this, the EU will need more money, the SPD concludes, adding that contributions from national funds will not be enough.

Here, the physician uses syringes, sponges, gloves, body parts, blood and diagnostic samples. Once treated, these materials become useless as they cannot be used on other patients. All these biomedical trash have to be treated or disposed of correctly. The medical waste management Henrico VA experts will help in this.\n\nEvery hospital must play the role of ensuring the elements used are cleared from the compound. A Proper way of disposal must be implemented to prevent side effects. Items like syringe will not be used twice and if the nurse does this, they can be sued for committing malpractice. To avoid such cases, they bring the licensed companies to do the job.\n\nWorking with these companies ensures the junk is cleared from the site. You come across some hazardous elements managed internally. However, all this can be done perfectly by the trained staff send by the company. The service providers are licensed to pick, segregate and transport the garbage to the designated place and following the rules set.\n\nThe local hospitals can use the disposal companies because they are legally viable and allowed to operate. The local authorities have come up with regulations that guide on how the hazardous material disposal should be done. There are guidelines for each type of litter and the limits. These firms are self-regulated, and they follow the rules set to avoid disease outbreak and injuries affecting the local population.\n\nWhen it comes to hospital garbage, there is a need to use proper ways to clear it from the site. You find biohazard element that needs special attention. The firms hired know how to clear dirt and then have it transported to the right venue. In fact, they start by segregating the elements in one bin and if they are recycled, then it becomes easier. This way, everything will go on as planned and even prevent injuries.\n\nIn every place, the public health must be managed. Therefore, disposing the waste from the clinic must be done using the set guidelines to prevent future risks. If any hazardous material is thrown into the compound, the environment is destroyed and this affects people and animals that reach such sites. It will affect patients and doctors by infecting them with toxins.\n\nWhen doing the disposal, these firms will segregate the elements into categories before it is transported to various dumping sites set aside for this job only. Since the authorities understand the danger that comes, segregating things like gloves and blood samples in different containers make it easy.\n\nIt is not an easy thing to run a healthcare facility and have the junk cleared from the space. There are specimens used, and they have to be managed from the centers. Sometimes, there are those that are burned but some need more management than others. When you hire a company to do this, they always know how to remove the unwanted elements that have toxins and can affect the local population.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nWhen you are searching for information about medical waste management Henrico VA residents can visit our web pages online today.

The accelerator complex and the LHC produced a record amount of data in 2017. (Image: Julien Ordan/CERN) \nOn Monday, 4 December at 4.00 a.m., the accelerator operators hit the stop button on the accelerator complex and the Large Hadron Collider for their usual winter break. But while the machines are hibernating, there\u2019s no rest for the humans, as CERN teams will be busy with all the maintenance and upgrade work required before the machines are restarted in the spring. \nThe LHC has ended the year with yet another luminosity record , having produced 50 inverse femtobarns of data, i.e. 5 million billion collisions, in 2017. But the accelerator hasn\u2019t just produced lots of data for the physics programmes. \nBefore the technical stop, a number of new techniques for increasing the luminosity of the machine were tested. These techniques are mostly being developed for the LHC\u2019s successor, the High-Luminosity LHC . With a planned start-up date of 2026, the High-Luminosity LHC will produce five to ten times as many collisions as the current LHC. To do this, it will be kitted out with new equipment and will use a new optics scheme, based on ATS (Achromatic Telescopic Squeezing), a configuration that was tested this year at the LHC. \nHandling beams of particles is a bit like handling beams of light. In an accelerator, dipole magnets act like mirrors, guiding the beams around the bends. Quadrupole magnets act alternately like concave or convex lenses, keeping the beams in line transversally, but also and above all focusing them as much as possible at the interaction points of the experiments. Corrector magnets (hexapoles) correct chromatic aberrations (a bit like corrective lenses for astigmatism). Configuring the optics of an accelerator is all about combining the strengths of these different magnets. \nOne particularly efficient approach to increasing luminosity , and therefore the number of collisions, is to reduce the size of the beam at the interaction points, or in other words to compress the bunches of particles as much as possible. In the High-Luminosity LHC, more powerful quadrupole magnets with larger apertures, installed either side of the experiments, will focus the bunches before collision. However, for these magnets to be as effective as possible, the beam must first be considerably expanded: a bit like a stretching a spring as much as possible so that it retracts as much as possible. And this is where the new configuration comes in. Instead of just using the quadrupole magnets either side of the collision points, the ATS system also makes use of magnets situated further away from the experiments in the machine, transforming seven kilometres of the accelerator into a giant focusing system. \nGraph showing the integrated luminosity over the various runs of the LHC. In 2017, the LHC produced 50 inverse femtobarns of data, the equivalent of 5 million billion collisions. (Image: CERN) \nThese techniques have been used in part this year at the LHC and will be used even more during future runs. \u201c The heart of the High-Luminosity LHC is already beating in the LHC, \u201d explains St\u00e9phane Fartoukh, the physicist who came up with the new concept. \u201c The latest tests, carried out last week, have once again proved the reliability of the scheme and demonstrated other potential applications, sometimes beyond our initial expectations. \u201d \nFor further information: See the article in the Accelerating news newsletter.

It's been weeks since I first brought it, as I've mostly only been playing it just to get the daily bonus. Originally the ship felt very challenging and difficult to play, despite being an obvious step up from the British cruisers found from tiers 3 to 5 (with their thin and huge citadels). The Leander seemed fragile even when hit by the weakest and smallest caliber enemy weapons, and its ability and ideal method of doing damage seemed weird if not weak by conventional standards. Towards the tail end of my grind, I've become able to have fairly decent and fun games in the ship, although my frustration with the ship's strange specialization and traits remain. In practice, even the slightest mistake in this ship could be fatal. Your life seem to flash before your eyes when an enemy battleship sneezes.\nAs it seems the ship's advantages include:\n- The availability of heal, hydroacoustic search, and smoke. All 3 are highly useful but in practice don't seem to help enough.\n- It loses almost no speed in a turn allowing you to dodge enemy shots and torps.\n- Its concealment seems to be good. Although it isn't much consolation for someone who enjoys aggressive brawling.\n- The 152mm guns and their semi AP ammo seem to do solid damage to broadside on enemies of all ship classes, especially if they are distracted.\n- The torps do decent damage and have good arcs and okay range. The single shot or spread torp system offers some flexibility.\n- Aside from the citadel, the rest of the ship seems to get overpens when hit by heavy enemy shells.\nMeanwhile the ship seems to suffer in other ways such as:\n- The guns have a high arc, slow shell speed, and a mediocre 13.2km range. This minimize your ability to damage enemies from inside a smoke screen or damage maneuvering enemies.\n- I cannot start fires with my main armament due to the lack of a true HE ammo. This is a lot of trouble when engaging bow on enemies, DDs included. So many harmless bounces even off the superstructure. Ironically I've seen my 102mm secondaries starting fires...\n- The very very thin armor found on the ship everywhere other than the citadel is highly vulnerable to the typical HE spam encountered in pub battles. They tend to roll high, destroy modules, and start fires.\n- While the ships turns well, its top speed of 33 knots often isn't fast enough for you to get out of dodge. (vs. DDs and some cruisers)\n- When not using smoke or terrain cover, the Leander feels outgunned by virtually every other same tier cruisers, especially if they fire some HE.\n- Battleship secondaries, gunboat DDs (especially US and Soviet) are very dangerous to the Leander as it's vulnerable to fires and solid damage by small caliber enemy rounds.\n- The Leander seems to have no meaning torpedo defense system in place. Usually 2 hits with Japanese torpedos is enough to send it to the bottom.\n- It seems to have a very bad RNG when receiving damage. Sometimes the majority of your health evaporated in the blink of an eye.\n- The ship is often agile enough to avoid being hit by air strikes, but its AA (especially without defensive fire) is nowhere near the degree of potency needed to frustrate a well planned attack by a CV.\n- Even with the superintendent skill, the number of smoke and heals available remain insufficient in some games.\n- When firing at enemies in smoke, you often need friendlies to spot but they often don't. Also the relative window of safety in terms of engagement distance between your 13.2km maxium range and a range at which the enemies can neutralize you via torp spam, blind fire, hydroacoustic search, radar, secondary guns tends to be small...\nI've produced this YouTube video featuring 2 of my better replays in the ship. Please feel free watch and let me know what I'm doing right and what I'm doing wrong in the ship. Suggestions and recommendations on how to better utilize and equip the ship are always welcome, especially since I've researched the Fiji. In a sense I wish if the ship was less situational and can stand its ground better in a conventional gun fight.\nI've thought about a couple changes/buffs that might help the ship:\n- Increase the official thickness of the plating on the bow, stern, and superstructure of the ship to give it some resistance against HE hits, fires, and overmatch autopens by AP rounds.\n- Buff or improve the consumables it carries.

Subramaniam today reiterated that employers can take action against employees who buy fake medical certificates (MCs). \nHe said the offenders could be subjected to their company\u2019s disciplinary board and actions would be based on the board\u2019s recommendation. \n\u201cFalsification is a criminal issue. The police should take serious actions against the perpetrators. \n\u201cThe Health Ministry is continuously upgrading the systems involved in printing, storage and issuance of MCs to ensure irresponsible people do not misuse it,\u201d he said. \nMeanwhile, Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) president Dr Ravindran Naidu said that counterfeit MCs were usually produced by government clinics. \n\u201cEmployers should check with the clinic if they have any doubts about the MC. However, employers should also be understanding and accept legitimate MCs issued by doctors. \nHe said forcing people who are unwell to work would be really inconsiderate. \n\u201cIn the case of infectious diseases is also counterproductive, as other staff will also fall sick. Anyhow, the association does not condone fake MCs,\u201d he said. \nBoth parties were commenting on a recent case in Melaka where two men were nabbed for making, printing and selling fake MCs. 12 reads ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hari vysrynasari", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "datuk seri dr s. subramaniam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ravindran naidu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "subramaniam | new straits times", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nadiah koris", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysian medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the health ministry", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melaka", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:30.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e65c7f5fbdafc2dd2a33d29c774ab6c1086eb152", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrDvgpEtNDI4jar1sYjItp_2PwCUygGaODsJ3fgx0IVvrso1XgfrLL5j4znThOASITt8PGPH69TT3Ly7rzBtvcSVH4KwmE9d93uhvclmLYEUMNlkLsctOpy_nvZf60FLBYInaQST7mHZ1_MGs3t9kxcLLpqbszun4A-", "site_full": "bestgfx.org", "site": "bestgfx.org", "site_section": "http://bestgfx.org/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["photography", "graphics_software", "tech", "web_design_html", "hobbies_and_interests", "web_clip_art"], "section_title": "Free Download AE Project Vector Stock Web Template Photoshop Via Torrent Zippyshare", "title": "ThemeForest -

Politics \nNollywood films were so uninspiring this year, this year\u2019s YNaija2017Review list could easily have been doubled. These ugly 10 are the bottom of the barrel. Only films that scored a cinema release were considered for this list. Ranked from most tolerable to least tolerable. 10. Roti \nDirected by Kunle Afolayan, Roti says too little, observes even less and distances with its coldness before building to a climax that manages to be both fitting and unsatisfying at the same time. The film sputters to life briefly when Faithia Balogun and Toyin Oshinaike, as opportunistic parents show up as foils to the mourning duo at the center of the drama, but they are too peripheral to really matter. If more effort had been put into handling the story as respectfully as possible, Roti might have been a good film 9. Alter Ego \nAlter Ego is a long series of frustrating episodes. There is more tell than show. Aside from a male character\u2019s generous shot of his gorgeous behind, director Moses Inwang almost always fades to black just when things are about to get heated up in the sack. For a film that teased tons of sexually daring stuff during its promotional run, Alter Ego and its star, Omotola Jalade Ekeinde never quite summons the courage to deliver the goods. Not to mention the film\u2019s mixed up sexual politics and how woefully it fails the Bechdel test for a film that claims to explore female agency. 8. Celebrity Marriage \nTo see Celebrity Marriage to its noisy, clattering, jumbled conclusion is to demonstrate almost superhuman levels of patience. Or self-flagellation. For what else could be worse than watching Tonto Dikeh constantly mistake screaming herself hoarse for emoting? Perhaps the final 30 minutes of Moses Inwang\u2019s Alter Ego? It is a close call. Pascal Amanfo\u2019s direction is self-aware yet nonexistent. Sound is wobbly and goes on like so for long stretches. Almost no one comes out of this film looking good. 7. Idahosa Trails \nThe primary disappointment with Idahosa Trails may be that it ultimately fails to inspire any sort of emotion whatsoever, beyond basic blandness. Not awe, not reverence, not even fondness. Anyone who is remotely aware of the fiery brand of Pentecostalism that Archbishop Idahosa pioneered must recognize and be disappointed in the conclusion that this film doesn\u2019t even begin to do him justice. Not even by the most forgiving of lenses. 6. The Guest \nThere is no beating around the bush here. The editing on the film is practically non-existent. The Guest is far from a decent effort. It suffers from tonal shifts so abrupt and manages to make a mess out of the characterization, the one element that could have salvaged it. There\u2019s no saving this one from itself. From the moment Rita Dominic enters the picture, she seizes control of the film but her campy good intentions cannot cover up the film\u2019s second half where everything comes crashing down hopelessly. 5. Lost in London \nProducer Uduak Isong Oguamanam and her collaborator Anthony Kehinde Joseph make a misbegotten attempt to plug their film into the present national mood, one that has seen thousands fleeing the country on account of economic hardship. Nothing wrong about this but Lost in London has nothing intelligent to comment upon or no new body of knowledge to add to the discourse. it merely rehashes old gags and tired tropes and doesn\u2019t even bother to make them refreshing. 4. Stormy Hearts \nJust to reiterate, there is no shred of talent between the four lead characters in Stormy Hearts and the film\u2019s music reflects this. Badly dubbed, badly performed and terribly mixed, you want to weep when a character destroys Asa\u2019s classic, Bibanke. The end comes fast enough, and not a moment sooner. Someone is killed, another is arrested, true love runs its course and you, dear viewer can finally be rid of this affliction. Nothing to see here. 3. Alakada Reloaded \nThe formula for Alakada Reloaded is simple really, it is a wonder it isn\u2019t being replicated more frequently. Create a clich\u00e9d, instantly lovable, low brow character with endearing flaws, one that wears their ethnic bias proudly but can cross cultures to appeal to every kind of audience. Throw in a few good jokes, lots of bad ones. Plenty cameo appearances from questionable stars always help. Arrange some scenes that do not necessarily have to make sense or flow. Voila! We have a movie. Shame on us. 2. Blood in the Lagoon \nShot a couple years ago, Blood in the Lagoon hasn\u2019t aged well, not in the least and its producers may have been better served, sending it quietly, straight to video. No one would have shed any tears. Perhaps no one would have noticed. And it would have been just as well. The film is strangely lit, poorly acted, choppily edited, lazily written and carelessly directed. Nothing works here, and no one survives the hurricane. 1. Dognapped \nThe idea of making a film about a struggling comedian and his talking dog must have come from the same place Hollywood conceives imaginative live action fables like Cats & Dogs and comedies starring Eddie Murphy. A place of confluence, where faith meets adventure and risk is the price worth paying. This is the only explanation conceivable for the existence of a film like Kayode Kasum\u2019s Dognapped, a dismal, one joke turkey that starts and ends with nary a joyful note. \nThe writer tweets from @drwill20 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tonto dikeh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pascal amanfo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idahosa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kayode kasum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "omotola jalade ekeinde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kunle afolayan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faithia balogun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moses inwang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toyin oshinaike", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eddie murphy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rita dominic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bibanke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bechdel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony kehinde joseph", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "brainnews radio admin opinion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moses inwang", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagoon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:31.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c957c12ea749c07bfdb06096f5c86abf81018782", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5ggvwF_kPAGpwVycbDALDXFpoHCt.xGC_CLz_d5BzEnCssYREG1Xnq.sWKsQ.tDyhRL5whACFcZixfhJ6_UnXQVm7.pQkt5axZ14b0DRoAHJAhl4upCl7N5MsaKb.MPweyaH8UQubPy8S8EGbZoCWfA-", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "ETHDEVNL 4 DEC 2017 @ [BlockLab] Rotterdam -Flashboys | Walter Thoen -

Syria, 2015-16 Volume XXIII Winter 2016 Number 4 Brian Glyn Williams and Robert Souza Dr. Williams is Professor of Islamic History at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth and the author of Counter-Jihad. The American Military Experience in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria (University of Pennsylvania Press, November 2016). He previously worked for the CIA's CTC in Afghanistan and in Kabul for the Army's Information Operations. Mr. Souza is an assistant managing editor at Young Professionals in Foreign Policy in Washington, D.C., and a research analyst for the Center for the Study of Targeted Killings.\nSeptember 30, 2016, marked the first anniversary of Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to involve his nation militarily in the Syrian conflict on the side of Moscow's longtime ally, the Assad regime. According to initial Russian Defense Ministry statements and Putin himself, the mission had the primary objective of joining the U.S.-led coalition in fighting ISIS. Russia's chief of staff of the Presidential Executive Office at that time, Sergei Ivanov, using an alternative name for ISIS, laid out his country's official objectives on September 30, 2015: \"The military goal of the operation is strictly to provide air support for the [Syrian] government forces in their fight against Islamic State.\" 1 The Mufti of Kazan (the head of Russia's Tatar community) and members of the Russian parliament lined up to support Putin's campaign in Syria, described as a \"prophylactic against terrorist organizations\" that was necessary to \"destroy ISIS at its root.\" 2\nIt soon became widely apparent, however, that the Russians had conflated ISIS with CIA-backed rebels and various other anti-Assad Sunni rebel forces with no known connection to ISIS, creating the false narrative of a united terrorist monolith that needed to be eradicated in order to preserve stability in Syria. In the process, Putin was able to successfully \"shift the sands\" of the conflict and bolster the endangered Assad regime while simultaneously cultivating his image domestically as a strong leader: able to stand up to the West, project power abroad, and support an embattled ally against international jihadists. The operation has been consistently portrayed in Russia as an unmitigated success in \"inflicting heavy losses on Syrian terrorist groups.\" 3 There seems to be little doubt among observers that Putin's venture into the Mideast has reshaped the war in Syria, but has it been a success in the larger strategic sense?\nWhat follows is an effort to evaluate the first year of this still-unfolding military campaign, with the aim of assessing the validity of the Russian claims of success.\nBACKGROUND Russia has long been a key supporter of the Syrian Baathist Socialist regime. Hafez al-Assad, father and predecessor of current President Bashar al-Assad, spent years in the Soviet Union learning to fly MIG-15s and MIG-17s as an officer in the Syrian armed forces. The elder Assad subsequently seized control of Syria in a coup in 1970 and brought to power his ethno-religious group, the Alawites (15 percent of Syria's population, they adhere to a syncretic offshoot of Shiite Islam). Having designated himself president, Assad followed the model of a Soviet single-party state, with an all-pervasive network of intelligence agencies that kept the restless Sunni majority in check. 4\nIn 1971, the Assad regime provided the USSR with a naval facility in Tartus, on Syria's Mediterranean coast. It remains there today, Russia's sole military facility outside the former Soviet Union. Moscow's basic docking facility, however, is not big enough to be designated a \"base\"; instead it is described as a \"Material Technical Support Point.\" The Russian facility consists of two floating piers and an Amur-class floating workshop. It is not capable of supporting any of Russia's major warships \u2014 frigates, destroyers or its one comparatively small aircraft carrier. This Material Technical Support Point can in no way be compared to massive U.S. naval and aerial facilities in the Persian Gulf, which host 20 aircraft carriers, for example.\nStill, as the threat to Assad mounted in 2015 amid the bloody civil war \u2014 posed by a new alliance of non-ISIS Sunni rebel groups in northwest Syria known as Jaish al Fatah (the Army of Conquest) \u2014 concern grew in Moscow over possible threats to this asset. In addition to his interest in defending this facility, Putin feared the chaos stemming from the overthrow of strongmen in the region, having noted the turmoil that swept over Libya and Iraq following U.S. intervention. He also felt the need to show the world, and his own audience at home, that Russia stood by its allies. When the Arab Spring demonstrations shook the region in 2011, Putin claimed the United States had abandoned its ally, President Hosni Mubarak, in Egypt. But Putin decided to stand by his ally, Assad, when civil war broke out between the ruling Alawites and dozens of Sunni rebel groups.\nPutin feared the threat to Assad from an alliance of Sunni rebel groups, the aforementioned Army of Conquest, advancing on the Alawite coastal homeland. The Sunni alliance, which threatened both the Russian naval facility and Assad, had conquered Idlib Province in northwestern Syria soon after its formation in March 2015. Putin was alarmed when these Sunni rebels began to encroach on the Alawite coastal stronghold in southern Latakia (for three years the Sunni rebels had held northern Latakia).\nAt this time, the Iranians, unwavering allies of the Assad regime since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, warned Putin that Assad was going to fall and that they did not have the means to save him. In July 2015, the commander of the Quds Force, an elite extraterritorial special-forces arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Major General Qassem Soleimani, visited Moscow to make his case for Russian involvement in Syria. He explained that the Sunni rebel advances were endangering not only their joint ally Assad, but Russia's military assets at Tartus. A senior Assad official recalled, \"Soleimani put the map of Syria on the table. The Russians were very alarmed, and felt matters were in steep decline and that there were real dangers to the regime.\" 5 Soleimani was able to convince his Russian hosts that their involvement was essential.\nPutin agreed that Assad needed to be bolstered as a bulwark against \"terrorists,\" lumping all Sunni rebel groups into this category alongside ISIS. 6 Tellingly, Putin directly blamed the United States for \"creating the conditions in which the [ISIS] terrorist state was born\": \"Tens of thousands of militants are fighting under the banners of [ISIS]. Its ranks include former Iraqi servicemen who were thrown out on to the street after the [U.S.] invasion of Iraq in 2003.\" 7\nAfter Soleimani's visit, Putin was convinced of the need to robustly protect his Syrian ally, save the Russian facility at Tartus, and prevent the rise of jihadist groups of the sort that had taken power in post-Hussein Iraq, post-Qadhafi Libya and parts of Syria. In addition, Putin would be projecting Russia back onto the world stage after its widely condemned 2014 annexation of Crimea and incursions into the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. The idea of supporting Assad against CIA-backed Sunni rebel groups must have had a strong appeal.\nHaving decided on intervention, on August 26, 2015, Russia and Syria signed a formal agreement in Damascus granting Russia access to Syria's Hmeimim airbase near regime-controlled southern Latakia. 8 The pieces were thus in place for the projection of Russian power for the first time beyond the borders of the former Soviet Union. What resulted from this unexpected intervention in a war that had cost the lives of one in 10 Syrians and caused the near-collapse of the Assad regime was to come as a surprise to those who had expected Putin to fail in his \"quixotic\" adventure.\nRUSSIAN OFFICIAL INTERVENTION In early September 2015, Russia deployed artillery units and advanced T-90 \"Vladimir\" main battle tanks and flew in approximately 2,000 Russian military personnel to the Hmeimim base. They later deployed at Hmeimim S-400 \"Triumph\" anti-aircraft missiles with a 250-mile range to defend these assets. Most important, the Russians also dispatched to the base approximately 50 fighters and bombers (primarily Su-25 Frogfoot ground-attack planes, new Su-34 Fullback medium bombers, and Su-24 Fencer fighter jets) and several Mil 24 Hind attack helicopters. These air assets would later be bolstered by larger Tu-22M3 Backfire, Tu-160 Blackjack, and Tu-95MS Bear strategic bombers, from a base in Mozdok, capital of the Russian Caucasus republic of North Ossetia, and eventually from western Iran.\nThen, on September 30, in a move that caught America and its allies by surprise, the Russians began an intensive bombing campaign, informally known as Operation Vozmezdiye (retribution), against what they claimed were ISIS targets in Syria. However, the initial Russian strikes appeared to be against the Army of Conquest in the northwest and the capital of Idlib province. A member of a U.S.-backed Sunni rebel brigade operating in Talbiseh the day after the initial strikes observed, \"The [Assad] regime has bombed this area many times before, but not heavy like yesterday. \u2026 We knew there would be bombing from Russia, but we didn't think it would be like this.\" 9\nThe Obama administration did not initially seem to be worried by Putin's intervention in Syria. One official said, \"If he wants to jump into that mess, good luck,\" while another sarcastically said, \"Knock yourself out.\" 10 President Obama, who had thus far refused to insert U.S. personnel into Syria to support the Sunni rebels, clearly saw Putin's involvement as doomed. On October 2, he stated, \"An attempt by Russia and Iran to prop up Assad and try to pacify the population is just going to get them stuck in a quagmire, and it won't work. And they will be there for a while if they don't take a different course.\" 11\nBut the White House soon became concerned about the intervention, as it was negatively affecting moderate groups in the northwest supported by the United States and its Arab and Turkish allies. With Putin conflating all Sunni rebel groups with ISIS, the conflict gradually came to resemble a proxy war between Russia and the United States, despite efforts to \"de-conflict\" the crisis and make sure Russian and U.S. planes did not fly in the same airspace. The U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army (previously marginalized in the Army of Conquest) initially fought back ferociously against a Russian-backed Syrian army ground offensive in the northwest using American-supplied TOW (tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided) missiles to destroy Russian-built Syrian tanks in October 2015. One Russian T 90 tank did beat the odds and survived a direct missile strike, leading a Russian Ministry of Defense website to proclaim the tanks \"death proof\" after the video of the failed attack went viral online. 12 But the Russians adjusted and instead began using Mil 24 Hind attack helicopters, which could not be brought down by TOW missiles. In essence, the Hinds provided vital \"airborne artillery\" support and suppression fire for Syrian army advan\u00adces. Footage was widely posted online at the time by the Syrian government depicting Russian Hinds strafing rebel positions with missiles in support of their troops. 13\nThe CIA-backed Sunni rebels, who were forced to retreat, requested anti-aircraft missiles to shoot down Russian and Syrian jets and attack helicopters, but they were not delivered for fear of escalating the proxy conflict further. The CIA, by contrast, had had no qualms about providing Stinger shoulder-fired ground-to-air \"manpad\" missiles to the mujahideen in Afghanistan in the 1980s, where they proved to be the ultimate equalizer, downing Soviet jets and helicopters. One Free Syrian Army fighter bemoaned the lack of anti-aircraft missiles: \"We can have most of the weapons we want. But nothing to shoot down the planes.\" 14 As a result, the previously advancing Sunni rebels were forced on the defensive and began to retreat from northern Latakia, which they had held for three years, and parts of Idlib.\nMeanwhile, Putin announced he had arranged an intelligence-sharing agreement with Iran, Iraq and Syria. It appeared as if the demoralized Syrian regime, which had been low on manpower, would be bolstered by an alliance of Russia, Hezbollah and Iran (although at roughly this time an Iranian brigadier general advising the Assad regime was killed fighting in the east, as were several Russians, demonstrating the risks of involvement in the war).\nOn October 3, 2015, Hezbollah and Iran expanded their roles in the conflict by deploying fighters to the Hama and Homs provinces in western Syria \u2014 two strategically important locations for augmenting Assad's strongholds along the coast \u2014 to prepare major ground offensives backed by Russian airstrikes. 15 On October 7, pro-Assad forces from Iran and Hezbollah carried out their first major coordinated ground assaults on Sunni rebels in western Syria under the cover of Russian warplanes. 16 On that day, Russia also stepped up the bombing campaign, firing 26 new Kalibr cruise missiles at Sunni rebel targets in Aleppo, Idlib and Raqqa from warships 900 miles away in the Caspian Sea. It soon became apparent that Syria was a testing ground for Moscow's new state-of-the-art military technology, including the Su-34 \"Fullback\" fighter bomber, the Mi-35M attack helicopter, and the Kalibr cruise missile, later fired from Russian warships in the Mediterranean as well. 17\nBy mid-October 2015, with the assistance of Russian, Hezbollah and Iranian allies, Assad's forces began to stabilize and regain lost territory. By this time, it had become clear that the vast majority of Russian bombings were in the northwest against the Army of Conquest alliance of Sunni rebel groups threatening the Assad regime from territories they had recently conquered in Idlib. The White House made it clear it had not bought into Putin's narrative that he was waging counterterrorism in Syria. White House spokesman Jack Kirby bluntly stated:\nGreater than 90 percent of the strikes that we've seen them take to date have not been against ISIL or al-Qaida-affiliated terrorists. They've been largely against opposition groups, groups that want a better future for Syria and don't want to see the Assad regime stay in power. So whether they're hit by a cruise missile from the sea or a bomb from a Russian military aircraft, the result is the same: that Assad continues to get support from Russia. Assad continues to be able to have at his hands the capability of striking his own people, including those who are opposed to his regime. And that's not a good future for Syria. 18 Obama personally discussed the issue with Putin in a February 2016 phone call, and the White House later reported in an official statement that \"President Obama emphasized the importance now of Russia playing a constructive role by ceasing its air campaign against moderate opposition forces in Syria.\" 19 Putin was not, however, swayed by Obama. A Kremlin statement indicated it would continue its aerial campaign against the Nusra Front and \"other terroristic groups\" in the northwest.\nRepublican politicians used the Russian intervention to attack Obama for \"surrendering the Middle East to Putin,\" even as they criticized the Kremlin's aggression. Senator John McCain, who had visited moderate rebels in Syria and called for the creation of a no-fly zone to protect them, was particularly incensed: \"Mr. Putin is not interested in being our partner. He wants to shore up the Assad regime, he wants to establish Russia as a major power in the Middle East, he wants to use Syria as a live fire exercise for Russia's modernizing military.\" 20\nUndeterred by such criticism from Washington, which began to mount in October, the Russians went on to launch air attacks on the CIA-backed rebels in Hama and Homs provinces to the south of Idlib. The Russian Ministry of Defense described one attack on this region by a squadron of massive strategic bombers making the long flight to Syria from southern Russia: \"During a massive airstrike today, 14 important ISIL [ISIS] targets were destroyed by 34 air-launched cruise missiles. The targets destroyed include command posts that were used to coordinate ISIL activities in the provinces of Idlib and Aleppo, munition and supply depots in the northwestern part of Syria.\" 21\nThere was, however, a problem with this statement: ISIS did not have forces in Idlib or the areas of Aleppo that were targeted. Among the Russians' targets in this northwestern region were actually several U.S.-backed Sunni groups in the rebel alliance, such as the Free Syrian Army, Sham Legion, Jund al Aqsa, Jaish al Sunna, Ahrar ash Sham and Division 13. One U.S.-backed Sunni rebel leader whose position was bombed by Russian aircraft bemoaned the toll of the airstrike: \"We are on the front lines with Bashar al-Assad's army. We are moderate Syrian rebels and have no affiliation with ISIS. ISIS is at least 100 kilometers from where we are.\" 22 Another Sunni rebel stated, \"The Russian airstrikes for more than a month had intensified to a horrific extent, and they were bombing all the frontlines that we are on. We had to withdraw from the area because it would have been suicide to stay. The destruction cannot be described, even the trees have been burned as a result of this scorched-earth policy.\" 23 At the time, non-ISIS Sunni rebels began to post harrowing, close-up footage online of Russian aircraft dropping bombs on civilians in towns controlled by their forces in the northwest as they fired back, often from truckbeds mounted with anti-aircraft guns. 24\nStill, Russia officially claimed to be conducting pinpoint strikes on ISIS targets. To support its claims, the Russia Ministry of Defense released YouTube videos of several airstrikes purported to be against ISIS. 25 But the videos were scrutinized by investigative journalists using a collaborative verification platform to match the locations seen in the YouTube videos with satellite images, as well as ground-level photographs. 26 The journalists were able to conclude that Russia's claims contained numerous elements of Soviet-style disinformation. Most of the areas identified lacked a known ISIS presence, thus confirming what many had already suspected: Russia was primarily bombing Sunni rebel groups with no known connection to ISIS.\nIt must be stated that, among these groups being targeted in the northwest, was the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which had been declared a \"Foreign Terrorist Organization\" by the U.S. State Department. 27 This allowed Putin to claim his forces were engaged in a counterterrorism campaign. However, the Nusra Front was allied with several moderate Sunni groups that considered it to be an effective, local Syrian-dominated fighting force against Assad and not as fanatical as the foreign-led ISIS (the Nusra Front officially broke its ties to al-Qaeda in late July 2016 and renamed itself Jabhat Fateh al Sham, the Front for the Conquest of the Levant).\nFor all Putin's successes on the battlefield against what he described as \"terrorists,\" by late October 2015, the risks he was running in Syria began to materialize. On October 31, an ISIS affiliate in Egypt's Sinai Desert claimed responsibility for blowing up a Russian charter plane flying from the resort town of Sharm el Sheikh to St. Petersburg, killing all 224 people on board. Having perpetrated the deadliest disaster in Russian aviation history, ISIS gloated by posting a picture on its online magazine, Dabiq , of the small bomb that brought down the plane. In the publication, ISIS justified its action as a response to the Russian airstrikes in Syria, which it termed \"a rash decision of arrogance.\" 28 Putin responded by declaring, \"Our military operation with aviation in Syria should not simply continue, it should be intensified so that the criminals understand that revenge is unavoidable.\" 29 Media in Russia began casting the campaign in Syria as one of revenge or retribution.\nThen, on November 24, a Turkish air-force F-16 shot down a Russian Su-24 \"Fencer\" fighter-bomber that had strayed for 17 seconds into the southern Turkish province of Hatay. The Turkish newspaper Millet reported that the trespassing Russian plane had been warned before it was shot down that it was about to cross the Turkish border, a contention supported by NATO, despite Russian protests to the contrary. 30\nThe two Russian pilots in the downed aircraft, Konstantin Murakhtin and Oleg Peshkov, ejected from the bomber and attempted to parachute to safety. Peshkov, however, was shot dead by vengeful Turkmen rebel forces as he descended; his body was found riddled with bullets. To compound matters, Alparslan \u00c7elik, a Turkish citizen belonging to a nationalist group known as the Boz Kurts (Grey Wolves), claimed responsibility for killing the Russian pilot \u2014 in retaliation for the bombing of Turkmen civilians. 31 The other Russian pilot was rescued by Russian special forces, who, despite losing an Mi 8 helicopter and a Russian marine to a rebel TOW missile during the search, were able to follow his radio beacon and save him. 32\nWhile the shoot down came as a shock to many observers, who saw it as an overreaction, those who knew the region saw it as a direct response to Moscow's repeated aerial bombardment of Turkish-supported Syrian Turkmen rebels operating in northern Syria's Jabal al-Turkmen region. These rebels, whose long-repressed ethnic group is essentially Turkish, claimed, \"The Russians were heavily bombing Turkmen villages before the downing of the plane. Thousands of Turkmen families have been driven to the [Turkish] border.\" 33 Prior to the downing of the jet, Turkey had warned Russia that \"the Russian side's actions were not a fight against terror, \u2026 they bombed civilian Turkmen villages and this could lead to serious consequences.\" 34 As late as November 20, 2015 (four days before the downing of the Russian jet), Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu had described northern Syria's Turkmen as \" karde\u015flerimiz \" (our brothers), stating, \"If the Russian Air Force and army are fighting Daesh [ISIS] then they should fight Daesh.\" 35\nPutin personally vowed \"revenge\" for the downing of the jet, which he described as a \"stab in the back\" by Turkish \"terrorist accomplices.\" 36 On the following day, Turkey's Sabah newspaper reported that seven drivers were killed in the bombing of an aid convoy traveling from Turkey into Syria near the border town of Azaz. 37 Russia followed up this bombing with a large-scale attack in the Idlib province on November 29.\nBut the Kremlin's air offensive soon gained a reputation for the lack of discrimination it had used in Chechnya. In the second Chechen conflict, 1999-2009, Russian bombers had callously obliterated whole neighborhoods in the capital of Grozny to drive out rebels. They also had ample experience in using Hind attack helicopters to strafe villages suspected of sheltering Chechen boyeviks (fighters). 38\nIt quickly became obvious that the Russian forces did not have close-air-support advisers on the frontlines in Syria of the sort the Americans had embedded with anti-ISIS Kurdish forces operating in Syria's northern Hasaka Province and on the front in Mosul, Fallujah and Ramadi in Iraq. Instead of having spotters on the ground calling in precision bomb strikes, the Russian air force defaulted to a clumsy strategy of indiscriminately bombing whole neighborhoods and towns under Sunni rebel control.\nFollowing the pattern set by the \"rubbleization\" of Grozny, a Russian airstrike on a crowded market in Ariha, a town controlled by the Army of Conquest, killed at least 44 people and wounded scores more. A witness at the scene recalled, \"In just a few moments, people were screaming, the smell of burning was in the air and there was just chaos. There was a primary school nearby, and children were running out absolutely terrified. \u2026 There were bodies everywhere, decapitated and mutilated.\" 39 On October 20, the Sarmin field hospital in suburban Idlib was struck by Russian warplanes, killing 13 people, including two medical staff. \"I wish I could say that targeting a hospital in Syria is unique, but is not,\" said Dr. Mohamed Tennari. \"The field hospital I direct in Sarmin has been hit by airstrikes more than a dozen times \u2014 by the Syrian government and now by the Russian government.\" 40 Britain's Guardian was to report in March 2016 that Russia's indiscriminate bombing had killed approximately 2,000 civilians in Syria. 41\nIn early December 2015, the Russians stepped up their involvement and began preparations to expand operations by opening a second major airbase in Syria. They deployed reinforcements to al-Shayrat airbase near Homs, which already housed many attack helicopters in its fortified hangars. The base was bolstered by military personnel, increasing the number of Russian troops in Syria from the initial 2,000 to roughly 4,000, (slightly fewer than the 5,000 military personnel Obama deployed in Iraq to bolster Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces in their offensive against ISIS by the fall of 2016). Many of these troops were guard personnel involved in protecting the aircraft used to provide close air support for Syrian troops.\nMeanwhile, the Russian campaign to tilt the balance in favor of Assad appeared to weaken the U.S.-backed rebels in Aleppo Province sufficiently for ISIS to make some advances in the northern areas of the region. 42 The Russian air campaign also allowed Syrian government troops to clear Sunni rebels out of the Alawite homeland in northern Latakia. In February 2016, Russian aircraft continued their momentum, supporting regime troops and allied Hezbollah and Iranian fighters, encircling neighborhoods of eastern Aleppo that had been controlled by Sunni rebels since 2012. In the process, the revived Assad forces were able to cut off the rebels' supply lines to the Turkish border at Bab al-Salameh, their most successful offensive of the war.\nThis decisive offensive also broke a three-year siege of several pro-government neighborhoods in the area, causing a panicked flight of Sunni refugees to Turkey. As the Russians and Syrian air forces indiscriminately bombed rebel areas, causing hundreds of civilian casualties, the Syrian army starved rebel-controlled neighborhoods. While the Russian bombing was, more often than not, indiscriminate, it could also be deadly accurate. A Russian airstrike just prior to this, for example, killed Zahran Alloush, a powerful Sunni rebel commander who led a major fighting force known as the Army of Islam on December 25, 2015.\nAs Russian involvement expanded in the north, Russian-backed Syrian army forces were also able to go on the offensive against Sunni rebels belonging to the moderate alliance dominated by the Free Syrian Army in the south around Daraa. Most important, the Syrian army was able to take over the Damascus-Daraa road in February 2016, by gaining control of the towns of al-Shaykh Maskin and Uthman. In both north and south, the Russian intervention thus propped up the crumbling Assad regime, allowing it to maintain control over the western corridor, where most Syrians lived. It also fulfilled Putin's goal of preventing the fall of Damascus to jihadists and allowed Assad to go on the offensive from Daraa to Hama and Homs to Aleppo and Latakia.\nIn addition to propping up the Syrian army and bolstering its rather limited ground offensives, Putin's incursion also quashed any discussion of a no-fly zone or \"safe zone\" north of Aleppo. The United States and Turkey had been discussing plans to keep Syrian air-force planes out of a 60-mile zone between Aleppo and Turkey to protect Sunni rebels and civilians north of Syria's largest city. With Russian fighter-bombers active in and around Aleppo, such a plan might have led to U.S.-Russian aerial confrontations, so it was shelved. This proved a tremendous boon to the Syrian army forces, which, by spring 2016, captured some of the area that would have been included in the no-fly zone and cut off the rebels' supply line to Turkey, the Azaz Corridor.\nFrom the fall of 2015 to the winter of 2016, Operation Retribution reshaped the battlefield in western Syria. However, it did not have much impact on ISIS, which controlled a swath of territory stretching from the Turkish border at Tarabulus to its capital at Raqqa in the central Syrian desert to the Iraqi frontier at Abu Kamal. Prior to the Russian intervention, Assad's forces were said to have been so depleted that the government was weighing a retreat from Damascus to the coastal heartland of the Alawites near Latakia and Tartus. 43 While the Syrian army at one time comprised 220,000 troops (many of whom were Sunni conscripts led by Alawite commanders), it had dwindled to an Alawite-led core of 65,000 personnel. 44\nIt became clear that a second Russian goal appeared to be to establish \"facts on the ground\" that would allow Assad to negotiate from a new position of strength when peace talks commenced. This could be done by destroying or weakening the more moderate Sunni rebel groups, effectively leaving the American-led coalition with a stark choice: supporting Assad or ISIS \"Caliph\" Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. As previously stated, Putin's calculus seemed to be to reassert his country as a major player on the world stage following its March 2014 invasion of the Crimean Peninsula, and he thought his role in shaping the U.S.-led coalition's choices in Syria would help achieve that objective. 45\nDespite a few setbacks and tension with Assad, Russian support succeeded in bolstering his regime, allowing it to make modest gains on the ground that were temporarily frozen by a Russian- and American-backed ceasefire signed on February 27, 2016. This cessation of hostilities between almost 100 Sunni rebel groups and the Assad regime (it did not include ISIS or the Nusra Front) led to deliveries of humanitarian aid to hundreds of thousands of people in besieged zones. But with ISIS and the Nusra Front outside the parameters of the ceasefire, its impact was limited beyond Aleppo; the Nusra Front was active in the northwest as an ally of many moderate Sunni groups.\nHaving buttressed the faltering Assad regime, Putin inserted himself as a major player in the Middle East and achieved a seat at the table for peace talks in Geneva in March 2016. Then Putin surprised the White House and announced on March 14, 2016, that the Russian military's goals in Syria were \"on the whole accomplished\" and that he would withdraw his \"main forces.\" 46 The announcement seemed to signify that Russia would not permanently back Assad with its air force, although it was unclear when or if a complete withdrawal would take place.\nWhile President Obama called the five-month Russian intervention in Syria a \"blunder,\" Putin's limited campaign seemed to demonstrate that intervening in Syria did not necessarily have to be a slippery slope leading to a quagmire. Putin had seemingly put both his troops and his advanced T-90 battle tanks on the ground, reconfigured the battlefield, then quickly called for their withdrawal with only a few casualties. This suited the Russian public, strongly supportive of their president, but harboring memories of the disastrous Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\nHistory would show, however, that Putin's mission was not yet accomplished. Despite his official order for the withdrawal of troops, Russia remained very much involved in a protracted war in Syria. In fact, Russia gradually found itself enmeshed in a lingering battle against ISIS fighters in Syria's vast eastern desert and Sunni rebels trying to break the siege of Aleppo in the northwest.\nMISSION ACCOMPLISHED? Even as Putin announced that major operations in Syria were over, reports began to emerge of continued Russian involvement. Pavel Felgenhauer, a military analyst based in Moscow, stated that there had been no real Russian withdrawal: \"Some of the attack planes, yes, were flown back to Russia, others were flown back to replace them; new advanced helicopters, gunships. But everything else stayed. The ground crews mostly, the logistics, the stockpiles of weapons. So that was mostly a diversional PR move.\" 47 It soon became apparent that these residual Russian forces had a new mission, most notably, support for a Syrian ground offensive in the eastern desert. This time Russia was finally involved in fighting, not against CIA-backed rebels in the northwest, but against ISIS.\nOn March 27, Russian forces assisted the Assad regime in recapturing from ISIS the city of Tadmur, home to the ancient ruins of Palmyra. While ISIS, in the thirteenth issue of Dabiq , would proclaim victory over Syrian forces backed by Russian aircraft, they were ultimately defeated by the heavy firepower of the allied forces. 48 Syrian government troops on the ground were backed by Russian airpower as they drove ISIS forces from the \"bride of the desert,\" as Palmyra was known. Approximately 400 ISIS fighters were killed in this offensive, one of the group's worst defeats since its humiliation by YPG Kurds backed by U.S. bombers in the border town of Kobane in November 2015. 49\nTo celebrate this victory, a Russian symphony orchestra led by renowned conductor Valery Gergiev was flown in to perform a surprise concert in a second-century Roman amphitheater in the heart of ISIS-ravaged Palmyra. While under ISIS control, the amphitheater had served as the set for a 2015 film featuring the execution of 25 Assad-regime soldiers by an ISIS firing squad. The stark contrast between the medieval ISIS atrocities and the beauty of the Russian concert was resonant with symbolism. Putin clearly intended to portray Russian intervention in Syria as a mission civilisatrice . Seizing the moment for all it was worth, Putin proclaimed his \"hope for Palmyra's revival as the heritage of the whole of humanity, but also as hope that our contemporary civilization will be relieved from this horrible disease, international terrorism.\" 50\nHaving liberated Palmyra, located in the heart of the desert, Russian ground forces established a new base just to its west. The military assets there consisted of mine-clearing equipment and dozens of fighting vehicles, in addition to armored personnel carriers to help protect the site from potential attack. While these assets were purportedly for defensive purposes vis-\u00e0-vis ISIS, Russia also deployed a sophisticated Pantsir-S1 air-defense system with the capacity to both launch missiles and fire cannons at incoming planes. 51\nBut the Russian presence proved to be a magnet for ISIS attacks, and on the evening of July 8, ISIS launched a coordinated assault on Palmyra. During the attack, what appeared to be a state-of-the-art Russian Mil MI-35M Hind E attack helicopter was shot down. The next day, Pravda and Lenta RU , popular Russian-language newspapers, confirmed that the advanced helicopter had been destroyed, resulting in the death of two Russian \"military instruction pilots,\" Ryafagat Habibullin and Yevgeny Dolgin. 52\nColonel Habibullin, who had the qualification of \"pilot-sniper,\" was, however, much more than just a military instruction pilot. He had participated in the Georgian civil war during the 1990s, the war in Chechnya from 1994-2002, and again in Georgia during the 2008 Russian invasion. While in Chechnya, Habibullin's Mi-24 was shot down by a DShK anti-aircraft gun, and he was the lone survivor. 53 In 2012, Putin personally visited the military base Habibullin commanded in the Krasnodar region of Russia to award it with an Order of Kutuzov on the hundredth anniversary of the Russian Air Force. There Putin declared, \"Your unit has been on combat duty serving our Fatherland for the past 60 years. Its victories are truly legendary and heroic.\" 54\nHabibullin was considered to be one of Russia's most experienced pilots and a legend in Russian army aviation, but Syria would be his last war. On the evening of July 8, ISIS released a YouTube video of an explosion that seemed to disable the tail rotor of his helicopter as it spun out of control and the two pilots plunged to their deaths. The Moscow-based Conflict Intelligence Team, which investigates Russia's involvement in Syria, was able to match the landscape in the video to a Google Earth landscape model, confirming that the video was filmed just east of Palmyra, as ISIS claimed. 55\nSince then, Russia has been heavily involved in supporting Syrian government offensives against rebel-controlled areas in the east of Aleppo in the late summer and fall of 2016. While the Assad regime, with support from Russian air strikes, has been effective in rolling back the offensives from Sunni rebel groups and laying siege to rebel controlled areas around Aleppo, this caused a humanitarian crisis. As many as a quarter of a million people faced starvation due to the Russian-Syrian encirclement of their neighborhoods.\nIn response to international condemnation, Russia claimed to have opened \"humanitarian corridors\" in early August 2016 to allow civilians to leave the besieged city. According to the pro-Assad Syrian state news agency, SANA, \"scores of families\" left rebel-controlled neighborhoods in eastern Aleppo via the corridors and a number of rebels began turning themselves and their weapons in. 56 Sources on the ground, however, claimed to have visited the crossings but to have seen no such activity, nor any sign that the corridors had even been opened. 57\nAs the Syrian-Russian siege of Aleppo unfolded, on August 1, another Russian helicopter, this time an Mi-8 \"Hip,\" was shot down over the city, killing all five on board. While no group immediately claimed responsibility, video footage soon emerged showing dozens of fighters chanting \"Allahu Akbar\" around the flaming wreckage. 58\nThere was other bad news for Russia as well. Putin's involvement in fighting ISIS (in Palmyra) earned his nation the wrath of the terrorist group. On July 30, 2016, ISIS released a nine-minute video in which a Russian-speaking fighter threatened Putin directly: \"Listen O Putin, we will come to you in Russia, we will kill you all in your homes, Allah willing.\" The Russian-speaking, masked militant also urged Muslims to mobilize for jihad against the nonbelievers and launch attacks on Russian soil. 59\nThus far, there have, however, only been four small ISIS-inspired attacks in Russia. This is despite the fact that the Soufan Group, a New York-based intelligence consulting firm that tracks foreign fighters who have joined ISIS, has found that 2,400 Russian citizens have joined the group and represent a \"blowback\" threat. 60 The first terrorist attack involved a shooting incident in the city of Derbent in the insurgency-plagued southern Muslim republic of Dagestan. The second involved the beheading of a Russian child by a Muslim nanny to protest Putin's bombing campaign and imitate an ISIS beheading of what it called a \"Russian spy\" in Syria. The third involved an attack on traffic police in Moscow in August 2016 by two axe- and gun-wielding Chechens who had sworn allegiance to ISIS. The fourth involved an October 23, 2016, attack on police in the town of Nizhny Novgorod by two terrorists pledged to ISIS; both were shot dead.\nMeanwhile, the Russian-Syrian alliance's gains in the northwest around Aleppo remained tenuous. In August 2016, the Sunni rebel alliance led by Nusra Front suicide bombers claimed to have broken a Syrian army siege of the eastern part of the city that had been supported by regular Russian aerial bombardments, effectively turning the tables once again on Assad and his allies. This breakthrough victory was a major boost for the Army of Conquest in Aleppo, and the alliance pledged to keep fighting until they recaptured the entire city. Alliance leaders announced at the time, \"We will not rest until we raise the flag of conquest over Aleppo's citadel.\"\nIn response to these developments, on August 16, Russia began using long-range Tu-22M3 Backfire and Sukhoi-34 Fullback bombers flying from an Iranian base known as Shahid Nojeh, 30 miles north of Hamadan in western Iran. The mission: to carry out what the Russian Defense Ministry described as \"group massed strikes on militant positions\" in Aleppo, Deir al-Zour and Idlib. 61 The following day, a second wave of Sukhoi-\u0663\u0664 bombers took off from the Iranian base and conducted a raid against ISIS in Deir al-Zour. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, \"The planes carried the maximum payload of high explosive fragmentation bombs OFAB-500. \u2026 As a result of the strike, two command centers and large field training camps of [ISIS] near Deir el-Zour were destroyed. More than 150 militants, including foreign mercenaries, were killed.\" 62 Russia Today further added, \"The core benefit for the Russian Air Force is a drastic reduction in flying time to terrorist targets in Syria.\" 63\nThe closer location of the Iranian bases to the Syrian battlefields enabled the Russian strategic bombers, considered too heavy to be accommodated by the Russian airstrips in Syria, to carry larger payloads (including incendiary bombs, whose use in civilian areas is banned) than is possible from distant Russia. 64 The trip was 1,000 miles shorter than from the airfields in North Ossetia in the Caucasus.\nThe Russian-Iranian arrangement appeared to be temporary; Iran's constitution unequivocally bans the establishment of foreign military bases on Iranian soil. 65 Not even the shah had dared to allow Americans to deploy military forces in combat from his country. The agreement was fraught with tension; Iranians even alluded to Moscow's occupation of Iranian territory after World War II. The agreement appeared at least officially to fall apart a week after it began. The Iranians claimed on August 22, 2016, that it had been secret and that Moscow's public announcement had been \"ungentlemanly.\" 66 Russia's Interfax news agency on August 22 Quote: d Moscow's ambassador to Tehran, Levan Dzhagaryan, as confirming that all of Russia's warplanes have been withdrawn from Iran. He said, however, that he did \"not see any reason\" why the Russians could not use the Iranian base again in the future.\nMeanwhile, Russia and America tried to patch up their differences in regard to the war in Syria. After bloody fighting in the summer of 2016, which exacerbated the worst humanitarian crisis of the twenty-first century, months of U.S.-Russian peacemaking efforts culminated in an ambitious deal initiating a nationwide ceasefire. Under the terms of the deal, all parties would refrain from both air and ground attacks \u2014 except for Syrian government attacks on ISIS and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly the Nusra Front) \u2014 so that humanitarian aid could reach Aleppo and other besieged territories unimpeded. It would also allow the United States and Russia to organize a Joint Implementation Center in the vicinity of Amman, Jordan, from which the two countries could begin a bilateral military campaign against agreed terrorist targets.\nBut on September 17, 2016, U.S. and Coalition aircraft that were targeting ISIS militants on Al-Tharda Mountain, near Deir ez-Zour in eastern Syria, accidentally bombed Syrian military personnel who were attacking these very ISIS forces. Coalition spokesmen claimed that the aircraft called off their attacks on what they thought was an \"ISIS tank position\" once Russian officials notified the Coalition's Combined Air Operations Center that the targets were actually Syrian military. But by then it was too late. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least 90 Syrian soldiers lost their lives in the bombing.67 The Russian Defense Ministry wasted no time in condemning the attack: \"We consider what happened as a natural result of the persistent refusal of the United States from [sic] the establishment of close cooperation with Russia in the fight against ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra [Jabhat Fateh al-Sham] and other affiliated terrorist groups.\" 68\nTwo days later, on September 19, a UN/Red Crescent aid convoy delivering food relief to a rebel-held area near Aleppo was targeted in an airstrike, destroying 18 vehicles and killing at least 20 people. The UN subsequently suspended all of the much-needed aid deliveries to Syria. The Americans blamed the Russians, but Moscow denied involvement. Their denials were, however, undermined when the tailfin of a Russian bomb was found in the crater of one of the bomb strikes on the convoy, and footage of a Russian drone monitoring the convoy was released.\nAs Russia continued to indiscriminately bomb Sunni eastern Aleppo, on October 3, the U.S. State Department officially suspended efforts to both implement the ceasefire with Russia and organize a joint military-coordination body. The State Department cited Russia's \"failure to abide by international law\" as the primary reason for the collapse. The State Department also declared that \"Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course, inconsistent with the Cessation of Hostilities, as demonstrated by their intensified attacks against civilian areas, targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need.\" 69\nAs the tensions between Moscow and Washington heated up, Putin deployed the entire operational Northern Fleet to the Mediterranean in mid-October 2016. This was, however, more of a saber-rattling propaganda gesture than a projection of real might. The outdated aircraft carrier that formed the core of the seven-ship battle group, the Admiral Kuznetsov , was a relic from the Cold War and was unable to serve as a significant platform for deploying Russian aircraft to Syria.\nCONCLUSION These events are still unfolding on shifting sands, but they indicate some of the risks that might have been foreseen from Putin's bold decision to enter the fray in Syria, such as a rise in tensions with America and such regional allies as Turkey. From the counterterrorism perspective, Putin's military campaign would certainly seem to have been fraught with risks. His involvement in Syria put his nation squarely in the terrorists' crosshairs. Most notably, it led to the retaliatory downing of the Russian civilian airliner in Sinai, Russia's deadliest air disaster. But there were also unforeseen benefits: the growing alliance with Tehran that led to a historic, if seemingly temporary, agreement on the basing of Russian bombers. But despite the risks and setbacks, the consensus among both Russian and Western observers initially seemed to be that Putin's decision paid off; he had achieved his narrow objectives on the battlefield in western Syria. The New York Times captured the new conventional wisdom in a front-page article on August 6, 2016: \"Military Success in Syria Gives Putin Upper Hand in U.S. Proxy War.\"\nAmong other successes, Putin shored up the embattled Assad regime and even helped it go on the offensive in small, rebel-controlled areas in the east, south and north of Aleppo. In the process, he prevented the CIA-backed Sunni rebels from advancing further into southern Latakia and bolstered the Assad regime as it faced the real prospect of losing much of northwestern Syria and retreating to the Alawite coastal homeland. This was Putin's primary objective and it led to such ancillary successes as the strengthening of the Assad regime's hand in peace negotiations, the shelving of American-Turkish plans for a \"safe zone\" north of Aleppo, and a strengthening of ties with Tehran.\nAfter declaring an official end to military operations (no doubt as a sop to Russians who feared a drawn-out Afghan-style quagmire) in March 2016, Putin legitimized his continued operations by helping the Syrian army recapture the UNESCO World Heritage site of Palmyra from ISIS. The Russian leader could now push the official Russian narrative that he was involved in the war on ISIS as well as the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which Russian aircraft had regularly targeted in the northwest. Putin was finally waging counterterrorism, instead of a counterinsurgency campaign such as the one he had carried out in the northwest against non-ISIS Sunni rebels.\nNot surprisingly, Iran's Press TV parroted the Kremlin's line, regularly touting their Russian allies' success against what the Iranians called the \"Takfiri terrorists\" (the strain of Sunni Islamism that encourages war on other Muslims they claim are \"non-Muslims\"). 70 Syria's official news agency, SANA, similarly published a barrage of stories describing Putin's support in the war on \"ISIS-Nusra Wahhabi terrorists,\" and Assad supporters thrilled to the images of Russian aerial bombardments of their Sunni enemies. 71\nFor all the proclamations from the Kremlin that it was a major player in the war on ISIS, however, maps of Russian airstrikes by the Institute for the Study of War clearly showed that the vast majority of its airstrikes were in a corridor in the west stretching from Aleppo in the north to Daraa in the south, far from ISIS's strongholds in the north and east. 72 And for all the fact that Moscow's efforts were focused on this region, the reality was that Moscow's intensive bombing campaign was not decisive and did not end the rebellion by such non-ISIS Sunni rebel groups as Jaish al-Fatah (Army of Conquest) and Jabhat Fateh al Sham (the former Nusra Front). As of this writing, the battle lines in Syria have not shifted dramatically since Putin launched his campaign; the war is still stalemated. To compound matters, Putin's campaign in Syria, designed to break Russia out of its isolation, has instead further alienated him from the world, due to the high civilian death toll in Aleppo and elsewhere.\nIt must also be stated that the Assad regime's extremely limited territorial gains paled in comparison to those of the U.S.-backed Iraqi government and Kurdish forces in neighboring Iraq (the Pentagon announced that ISIS had lost 45 percent of its territory in Iraq by the spring of 2016) and YPG Kurdish forces operating in northern Syria with U.S. support. 73 With the Sunni rebels far from defeated and still in control of much of the west, Russia runs the risk of being dragged into a prolonged fight in Syria that it cannot afford if it wants to decisively beat the so-called \"terroristic groupings\" in this region. Decisively beating the Sunni rebels would entail Moscow's becoming involved in exactly the sort of \"boots on the ground\" quagmire Obama predicted and that the Russian people don't have the stomach for.\nFor the time being, however, the Russian public seems to be behind Putin's predominantly air-based venture in Syria that has resulted in only a handful of Russian deaths. Vladimir Ryzhkov, a prominent Russian opposition politician, summed up the sense of pride many of his countrymen felt in the Russian involvement in Syria: \"Russian military officials are clearly showing the Americans that we have the same planes, the same smart bombs. We can carry out the same military campaign as you.\" 74 The head of the International Committee in Russia's upper house of parliament, Alexei Pushkov, boasted: \"I'm certain that the military capabilities displayed by Russia were a shock to the U.S., which apparently believed that only the United States and NATO can wage such a war.\" 75 Polls in Russia at the beginning of the campaign showed that 70 percent of Russians backed Putin's campaign. One pensioner in Red Square, Natalia Nikolaevna, summed up the feeling of many of her countrymen: \"[President Putin] is doing everything right. He's raised Russia from its knees.\" 76\nWhether Putin's domestically popular (for now) gamble in Syria proves to have a lasting effect on the ground or is merely ephemeral remains to be seen; the war in the northwest around Aleppo is still in flux. But at least the previously isolated leader can take consolation in the fact that he has made sure his country has a veto over any future ceasefire or peace deal in Syria. This small victory and his defense of his embattled client have, however, come at enormous cost in regard to Moscow's far more important relations with America and the West. Igor Zevelev, former director of the MacArthur Foundation's Russia office, summed up the damage to Russian-American relations caused, to a considerable extent, by Operation Retribution, \"It's not a Cold War\u2026.It's a much more dangerous and unpredictable situation.\" 77\nIn October 2016, Putin discussed in the newspaper Pravda the rapid deterioration of Russia's relations with America stemming from the Syrian intervention: \"We have never wanted that to happen. On the contrary, we wanted to have friendly relations with such a great country as the United States, the leading economy of the world.\" 78 As with his widely condemned annexation of the Crimea and incursion into the Donetsk region of Ukraine, it would seem that the wily leader from St. Petersburg, who came to power promising to make Russia great again, did not fully consider the impact his application of brute force in Syria would have on his vitally important relations with the West. Thus far, however, it would seem that his widely condemned gambit in the deserts of the Mideast \u2014 which has incurred the wrath of critics ranging from the United Nations to the White House to the leaders of the Arab Gulf states to ISIS \u2014 has, for all its narrow, tactical successes on the ground, been a failure in the wider strategic sense.\n1 \"Russian Parliament Unanimously Approves Use of Military in Syria to Fight ISIS,\" Russia Today, September 30, 2015.\n2 \"'Peacemaker Decision': The Reaction to the Agreement of the Federation Council on the Use of Armed Forces in Syria,\" TASS Russian News Agency, September 30, 2015, http://tass.ru/politika/2303457 .\n3 \"Farewell to Arms: Real Results of Russia's Air Campaign,\" Sputnik , March 20, 2016. http://sputniknews.com/middleeast/20160317/1036467551/russian-operation\u2026 .\n4 \"Why Russia Is in Syria,\" Washington Post , September 11, 2015.\n5 \"How Iranian General Plotted Out Syrian Assault in Moscow,\" Reuters, October 6, 2015.\n6 \"Obama's Call to UN to Fight ISIS with Ideas Is Largely Seen as Futile,\" New York Times , September 30, 2015.\n7 \"Clash of Words in Speeches to General Assembly,\" New York Times , September 29, 2015.\n8 \"Agreement on Placing Russian Air Group in the SAR Is Concluded for an Indefinite Period,\" RIA Novosti (Russia), January 14, 2016.\n9 \"After Denying Claims They're Killing Civilians, Russia Has Launched Fresh Airstrikes in Syria,\" VICE News, October 1, 2015.\n10 \"U.S. to Putin: Welcome to the ISIS Quagmire,\" Daily Beast , September 29, 2015.\n11 \"Press Conference by the President,\" WhiteHouse.gov, October 2, 2015, https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/10/02/press-conference\u2026 .\n12 \"Death Proof: Russia's T-90 Survives Missile Strike in Syria.\" Sputnik , March 27, 2016.\n13 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5O5Xn1RwZU .\n14 \"Syrian Rebels Decry Airstrikes,\" The Guardian , October 11, 2015.\n15 \"Iran Expands Role in Syria in Conjunction with Russia's Airstrikes,\" Wall Street Journal , October 2, 2015.\n16 \"Russia Has Ground Troop Battalion, Advanced Tanks in Syria: U.S. NATO Envoy,\" Reuters, October 7, 2015.\n17 \"Missile Ships Zeliony Dol and Serpukhov Performed Launches of Kalibr Cruise Missiles against Facilities of the Jabhat al-Nusra Terrorist Grouping in Syria,\" Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation, August 19, 2016, http://eng.mil.ru/en/news_page/country/more.htm?id=12093238@egNews .\n18 U.S. Department of State, Daily Press Briefing , October 7, 2015, http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2015/10/248005.htm .\n19 \"Readout of the President's Call with Russian President Vladimir Putin,\" WhiteHouse.gov, February 11, 2016, https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/14/readout-presiden\u2026 .\n20 \"U.S. Senator Blasts Truce Deal, Says It Serves Putin's Purpose,\" Radio Free Europe, February 14, 2016.\n21 \"Russian Warplanes Destroy 140 Terrorist Targets in Syria,\" Sputnik , November 18, 2015, http://sputniknews.com/middleeast/20151117/1030173378/russian-syria-ope\u2026 .\n22 \"Syrian Rebels Say Russia Is Targeting Them Rather Than ISIS,\" New York Times , October 1, 2015.\n23 \"Top 5 Ways Putin Has Won Big in Syria and Why Europe Is Embracing Him,\" Informed Comment , January 26, 2016.\n24 See, for example, the harrowing footage here on YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BvzF_WCmVg .\n25 See, for example, this footage that appeared on Russia Today: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI6n_TCj9-Y .\n26 \"Distract, Deceive, Destroy: Putin at War in Syria,\" Atlantic Council, April 2016.\n27 \"Foreign Terrorist Organizations,\" U.S. State Department, http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm .\n28 \"ISIS Publishes Photo of What It Says Is Bomb that Downed Russian Plane,\" CNN, November 19, 2015.\n29 \"Russian Airstrikes in Syria Will Continue, Intensify \u2014 Putin.\" Sputnik , November 17, 2015, http://sputniknews.com/world/20151117/1030243860/syria-russia-putin-air\u2026 .\n30 \"Plane Shot Down on Syrian Border,\" Millet (Turkey), November 24, 2015.\n31 \"Turkey Detains Alleged Killer of Russian Pilot Downed over Syrian Border,\" Russia Today, March 31, 2016.\n32 \"FSA Video Claims Russian-Made Helicopter Hit with U.S.-Made TOW Missile near Su-24 Crash Site,\" Russia Today, November 27, 2015.\n33 \"Russian Raids Repeatedly Hit Turkmen Areas, Russian Data Shows,\" Reuters.

shoot for playoff berth. By 0 From left: Vineyarders Ashleigh Moreis, Rose Engler and Meghan Sawyer defend against North Quincy last season. \u2014 Ralph Stewart \nEight players return from a Vineyard varsity girls team that finished 9-11 last season, one win short of a playoff berth. Playing without leading scorer Molly DeBettencourt for the final quarter of the season proved to be too high a hurdle to overcome. \nThis year, Molly is back in the lineup, as senior co-captain, along with Kiana Casey and Lily Pigott. Experience will not be an issue for the Vineyarders in 2017-18. Head Coach Sterling Bishop also has seniors Rose Engler, Ashleigh Moreis, Meghan Sawyer, and Leolani Kaeka on the roster, along with junior Alley Estrella. Sophomores include Sasha Lakis, who gives the Vineyarders a strong presence in the paint, Skyla Harthcock, and Taylor Hughes. Freshman Kylie Estrella completes the varsity lineup. Alyssa Lemoi returns for her third season as junior varsity coach. Gillian Sedlier, Mary Korba, and Maggie Riseborough are varsity assistants, while Kendall Robinson will assist Ms. Lemoi with the JV squad. \nCoach Bishop is confident that his veteran team has what it takes to reach the state tournament. \u201cThese girls have been playing together for so long,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability for them to communicate with each other has grown from last year, and I think we\u2019re going to use that to our advantage. We\u2019re really excited about this season \u2026 we have leadership, experience, and knowledge. We\u2019ll bring some of the young players along, and hopefully we\u2019ll have a successful season.\u201d \nThe Vineyard girls will compete in the Eastern Athletic Conference this season with Bishop Feehan, Bishop Stang, and Coyle and Cassidy before joining the Cape and Islands League next year. Feehan, a Division 1 powerhouse often ranked among the top 20 teams in the state, is the perennial league favorite, but Coach Bishop thinks the Vineyarders will more than hold their own throughout the league schedule. \u201cFeehan\u2019s always tough, but the girls will never quit. We\u2019ll fight to the end,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to be, at a minimum, the No. 2 seed in the EAC, and I think we can do it.\u201d \nThe new season gets underway on Saturday at the Sancy Pachico Gym in Oak Bluffs, with the Vineyarders hosting the North Quincy Red Raiders. The JV game tips off at 3 pm, with the varsity contest set for 4:30 pm.

It\u2019s so helpful to be able to quickly tell how an message was sent to me, so I can approach it the right way.\nNow I know that the message headers will leak information about any mailing list software that was used. I also know that I do most of my email management with Mutt , which is one of the most powerful and configurable clients going. All I needed was an extra column in the index view telling me if a particular substring appears in a header. Surely that wouldn\u2019t be too hard.\nActually it looked surprisingly impossible. Mutt tends to assume you run lots of other mail processing infrastructure (like your own procmail ), so there isn\u2019t that much built in. I had a lot of false starts, experimenting with the X-Label headers, trying out NeoMutt , and even patching the source (boy do I hate C!). And then out of the blue I discovered that Mutt does do what I want, as part of its spam handling .\nMutt doesn\u2019t attempt to do any spam/ham categorisation itself. But if the message has been preprocessed such that spam scoring has been added in as extra headers then Mutt can pull this information out and display it. And it\u2019s all based on regular expressions, so it\u2019s general enough for my purposes.\nIn fact, for some stuff I can tell the method just by looking at the From header:\nspam \"From:.*outbound.example.com\" \"ExampleNewsletter\" \nNow I just need to add %H to my $index_format to display it. Or even better, replace %s (the plain subject) with %?H?{%H} ?%s , which will add {ExampleNewsletter} to the front of the subject, a bit like how the tags appear in the Googlemail web interface. I found if you set $spam_separator to } { it will even handle multiple identifiers nicely.\nWhat\u2019s great about this is that it only operates at the presentation layer, so you don\u2019t need any backend support to persist your labelling, and you can update all your messages by just changing your .muttrc . It\u2019s just a bit silly that I\u2019ve resorted to using spam tools for emails that definitely aren\u2019t spam.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mutt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:33.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "52ba2445ac719273af197058be4b1971e0f1953c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTFoO5hXORmO0wjrDRMGfB.4MbGxrr6Ptf8g56eqgvaoVugiGV0Dn4gbhPnz5lxlkQizMkeOtFbWbfWJMe25LDc", "site_full": "stats.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://stats.stackexchange.com//feeds", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Cross Validated", "title": "Biased dice problem", "title_full": "Biased dice problem", "published": "2017-12-07T06:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stats/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=344f57aa10cc", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "52ba2445ac719273af197058be4b1971e0f1953c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTFoO5hXORmO0wjrDRMGfB.4MbGxrr6Ptf8g56eqgvaoVugiGV0Dn4gbhPnz5lxlkQizMkeOtFbWbfWJMe25LDc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Miguel", "published": "2017-12-07T06:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "Biased dice problem", "text": "up vote 0 down vote favorite \nLet's suppose I have a set of six colored dice $D = \\{d_1,d_2,...,d_6\\}$ with respective colors {red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet} and where each die is biased with chance $50\\%$ for one face; the other faces are equally probable.

If so, what causes this", "text": "up vote 4 down vote accepted \nCertainly. It is caused by sampling variation. \nthe count in a histogram bin is a random variable -- for fixed bins and fixed sample size the set of counts will have a multinomial distribution. The standard error of the bin count (conditioning on the total count) will generally be a little less than the square root of the expected bin count. Simple random variation will mean that there can be a dip between two higher bins (or even several such). \nIn six attempts at generating a histogram (in R) of a sample of 100 random values sampled from a standard normal distribution, I had about 4 where there was a \"dip\" in the bins - valley between peaks; of those, this one was the most strongly bimodal-looking of the six: \nWe see that the three central bins (counts 23, 15, 20) are fairly consistent with a unimodal set of expected counts and a standard deviation for each on the order of 4 or 5 (given that they're only weakly dependent). \nI subsequently generated another four such samples and got a second histogram that looked similarly bimodal. It seems that there's a fairly good chance of getting something that looks fairly strongly bimodal even at n=100. \nThe output of a histogram function in a typical stats package doesn't have fixed bins -- they depend on the data.

But never purple wind. Until now. \nThe colour-coded system showing the expected strength of the winds driving the region's fierce wildfires has reached uncharted territory, pushing past red, which means \"high\" into the colour that means \"extreme.\" \n\"The forecast for tomorrow is purple,\" said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \"We've never used purple before.\" \nSouthern California has already been hit hard by three major fires that have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed at nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure that is almost certain to grow. \nBut the hard-won progress of firefighters could be erased Thursday. \n\"We're talking winds that can surface that can be 80 miles an hour,\" Pimlott said. \"These will be winds that there will no ability to fight fires.\" \nSuch winds can instantly turn a tiny fire into a large one, or carry embers that spark new fires kilometres away. \nMillions of cellphones buzzed loudly Tuesday night from San Diego to Santa Barbara with a sound that usually means an Amber Alert, but this time meant a rare weather warning for strong winds making extreme fire danger. \nOfficials hope the electronic push will keep the whole region alert and keep the death toll from the week's fires at zero. \nMelissa Rosenzweig, 47, was briefly back home Tuesday after evacuating from her Ventura house, which has been spared so far while most on her street had burned in the largest and most destructive of the region's fires. She and her husband were about to evacuate again, hoping they will get lucky twice as the new winds arrive. \n\"Heck yeah I'm still worried,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We're very grateful but I know we're not out of the woods.\" \nIn what may have been an early sign of the 363-square-kilometre fire getting new life, several thousand new evacuations were ordered late Tuesday night in Ojai, a town of artists and resorts. The blaze had been creeping there already, but an increase in winds pushed it close enough for many more to flee. \nThe wilder winds could easily send make new fires explode too, as one did Wednesday in Los Angeles' exclusive Bel-Air section, where a fire consumed multimillion-dollar houses that give the rich and famous sweeping views of Los Angeles. \nLittle flame was visible by late Tuesday, but in the morning fire exploded on the steep slopes of Sepulveda Pass, closing a section of heavily travelled Interstate 405 and destroying four homes. \nFlames burned a wine storage shed at media mogul Rupert Murdoch's 6.5-hectare Moraga Vineyards estate and appeared to have damaged about 2.8 hectares of vines, a spokeswoman said. \nAcross the wide I-405 freeway from the fire, the Getty Center art complex was closed to protect its collection from smoke damage. Many schools across Los Angeles were closed because of poor air quality and classes were cancelled at 265 schools Thursday. \nBack in the beachside city of Ventura, the fire killed more than two dozen horses at a stable and had destroyed at least 150 structures, a number that was expected to get far bigger as firefighters are able to assess losses. \nAir tankers that had been grounded much of the week because of high winds flew on Wednesday, dropping flame retardant. Firefighters rushed to attack the fires before winds picked up again. \n\"We're basically in an urban firefight in Ventura, where if you can keep that house from burning, you might be able to slow the fire down,\" said Tim Chavez, a fire behaviour specialist at the blaze. \"But that's about it.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "decem", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ken pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pimlott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosenzweig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim chavez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rupert murdoch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa rosenzweig", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "california department of forestry", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sepulveda pass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ojai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif. - southern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ventura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bel-air", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa barbara", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:33.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d4db15dbc427e4b566b28b9c92774488f4b6b0b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG2X2sAAS0pd8icAfrsfyMHofMhSKADysporgzlcw7ombchMRjFH9CGjgZyym5aSORoUMvi8jZgPZE-", "site_full": "www.mumsnet.com", "site": "mumsnet.com", "site_section": "http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/sleep", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Sleep | Mumsnet Discussion ", "title": "I don't know what to do anymore", "title_full": "I don't know what to do anymore | Mumsnet Discussion", "published": "2017-12-07T14:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "/images/logo/mn-logo-square.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6762, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9a40e48fe462458900ffd831afbd524564a478ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.CtWGBCQ5SYfyGpKoy2hG2X2sAAS0pd8icAfrsfyMHofMhSKADysporgzlcw7ombchMRjFH9CGjgZyym5aSORooVrMTG7ePO5TYxy3RDWNog--", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "newmum7369", "published": "2017-12-07T16:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I do try to sleep when he does but because he only naps for 45 minutes by the time I manage to drop off it's not long until he wakes again.\nI posted about this about a month ago and FATEdestiny suggested more calories more sleep.

You are at a tough age 5 months. As you know he is developing so rapidly and changing so much it is hard to sleep. I find the bit between 5 to 10ish months the hardest - worse than the newborn bit.\nYou can try loads of techniques and I do think there are baby steps to encourage sleep. But to be honest I think they develop this the same as other skills - when they are ready. I think you are also in the short nap phase?\nI got really stressed with my first baby cuz I was so exhausted. Did all sorts of techniques and eventually she slept through on her own at 14m. This time I have got a calmer baby who self settles and has a dummy but still wakes a lot - has two feeds in the night and wants to get up at 4.30, this is at 8 months. Lots going on for him though he is crawling, trying to stand, etc. I found doing techniques just made me more stressed and frustrated - tried controlled crying once and I still feel a bit bad about that (she was sick on herself from crying).\nIf I was you I would try to focus on trying to get the basic things that you can work on that FATEdestiny often advises - ensure eats plenty in the day, dummy if poss, plenty of naps (however you can - push chair etc) and see if he will self settle. Then I would primarily focus on yourself (what I have done this time), take good vitamins, drink plenty of water day and night, eat properly, discuss with DH when you can have some time alone to sleep/relax and then look forward to it.\nThere is nothing wrong with leaving baby in cot when they are happy/playing about. My DS self settles so I always leave him in the night and day unless he is crying.\nI hope this helps - I really understand how hard it is so I have tried to give advice on trying to keep stress down as that would have helped me the first time rather than trying to 'fix' her sleep.\nTake care xx", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:33.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a056d022a5e30f09d71b9c33aea43417edc3d064", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSxrrbfHFtpB4YFzIMKZow3g-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a056d022a5e30f09d71b9c33aea43417edc3d064", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSxrrbfHFtpB4YFzIMKZow3g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "@Override\r\n    public void onBlockRedstoneChange( BlockRedstoneEvent event ) {\r\n        Block block = event.getBlock();\r\n        // TypeId 74 == GLOWING_REDSTONE_ORE\r\n        // TpyeId 73 == REDSTONE_ORE\r\n        if ( event.getNewCurrent() == 0 && block.getTypeId() == 74 ) {\r\n            block.setTypeId(Material.REDSTONE_ORE.getId());\r\n        }\r\n        int newPower = event.getNewCurrent() -

Tyler Stites is one such rider, with the 19 year old having just finished his first season at U23 level, where he raced some of America\u2019s biggest events, as well as getting to head across the pond to Europe to race for his national team, a big achievement for a first year U23. He has already produced results and will be one to watch, especially in the domestic scene, for 2018.\nThe Aevolo youngster took some time out of his offseason winter training to answer a few exclusive questions from U23 Cycling Zone about his big season, as well as alluding to some future goals.\n\u201cThe 2017 season was a learning experience for me. It was a big step up from the juniors and the first few races were really tough. I felt myself improving a lot as the season progressed,\u201d Tyler revealed.\nThe Green and Yellow squad has had a successful first season, sending two riders on to top US Pro teams. Plenty of their roster from 2017 attracted attention from big teams, but they have opted for another season with Aevolo. Tyler spoke about his team and the way they so successfully develop riders.\n\u201cAevolo has a great atmosphere for developing young riders such as myself, with lots of opportunities and not too much pressure. Despite being a new team, Aevolo has incredible support and stability which goes a long way to promote the growth of young riders.\u201d\nTyler Stites. Credit: Casey Gibson Tyler, despite admitting he struggled in the first few races of his U23 career, got off to a flying start in the UCI races he did, being selected for both Joe Martin stage race and Tour of the Gila. He followed that up with two impressive showings in Canada at GP Sagueny and at Tour de Beauce, where he was 13 th overall. For perspective, six riders in the top 12 ahead of Tyler were at least 20 at the time of the race, the only rider Tyler\u2019s age was his own teammate Gage Hecht, who is just a month older than Tyler.\nHe rounded out his season in Europe with Team USA (more on that later) and with a great ride again north of the border in Canada, at the country\u2019s biggest race, the Tour of Alberta. Stites was a little far down on the stage one summit finish, but bounced back to take 14 th , tenth and 16 th in the following three sprints. His teammate Michael Hernandez was 4 th , 9 th and 6 th in those sprints. Tyler confessed he wasn\u2019t leading Hernandez but, but that Michael was the protected rider in those races and Tyler was following him, trying to learn from his older teammate. After his good season, Tyler attributed his quick adaptation and growth at the U23 level to his team and their head DS, a former race mastermind at SmartStop, who masterminded a famous 1-2 for his small team at the US National Road Race a few seasons back.\n\u201cI attribute my progress in 2017 to the support from Aevolo, and the guidance from our DS, Mike Creed. His years of experience and uncanny foresight of how each race would unfold were very valuable in helping us understand bike races better.\u201d\nTyler celebrates winning a stage of the prestigious junior race Tour de l\u2019Abitibi ahead of compatriot Brandon McNulty in 2016. Credit: USA Cycling Just before Alberta, Tyler had the honour of being picked for Team USA to race the tough Tour of Alsace in France, along with the aforementioned Hernandez. The USA boys got off to a flyer, winning the team prologue for team leader Brandon McNulty. Tyler wasn\u2019t able to finish the race, but his work for the week was brilliant as McNulty wound up finishing 3 rd overall on GC. Tyler certainly gained experience, one of which came on the first road stage, which finished atop the steep climb of Planche des Belles Filles, a climb that has been won atop in the Tour de France by three Grand Tour winners: Chris Froome, Vincenzo Nibali and Fabio Aru.\n\u201cRacing up Planche des Belles Filles was an incredible experience. It was only a few weeks after the Tour de France raced up it, which made it even cooler. The final pitch up to the finish was a lot steeper than it looked on TV!\u201d\nTyler in action (left) during stage one of the Tour of Alberta. Credit: Casey Gibson Tyler is certainly not a pure climber, but he has more than shown an ability to get over hills and still be very fast at the end. Despite not having a lot of experience at U23 level, he knows exactly what races suit him.\n\u201cI like the hard circuit races with short, punchy climbs that slowly thin down the field lap after lap.\u201d\nAs a team, Aevolo have the goal of adding to their list of big stage races in the US, taking aim at the Colorado Classic and Tour of Utah. After making the roster for Joe Martin, Gila and Alberta, Tyler\u2019s big 2018 goal is to make the rosters for Utah and Colorado should his team receive the call-up to race.\n\u201cIn 2018 I have a goal to race some of the bigger US races like Utah and Colorado. This is a big team goal for Aevolo so being part of that would be great. I think in 2017 we proved we deserve a shot at those races after a strong showing at Tour of Alberta.\u201d\nAs a rider who can get over punchy climbs well, but still be able to produce big power in the sprint after hard days, there is one clear pro race that should suit Tyler. Therefore, it was not surprising that he picked his favourite race when asked which pro race he would love to win one day.\n\u201cI have always dreamed of winning Liege-Bastogne-Liege. It is my favorite race to watch, it is always exciting.\u201d\nTyler Stites and Aevolo are both young and still developing, but the team is full of riders to watch and will get better and better every season. Tyler is definitely one of those riders to keep an eye on for 2018, as he has all the qualities to star in both US races and across the ocean in Europe.\nU23 Cycling Zone would like to thank Tyler for taking part in the interview and wish him all the best for the coming season and beyond. We would also like to thank Aevolo press officer Clara Beard for helping put U23 Cycling Zone in contact with Tyler.

Choose: RGC - centroids of random subsamples . The data are partitioned randomly by k nonoveralpping, by membership, groups, and centroids of these groups are appointed to be the initial centres. Thus, centres are calculated, not selected from the existent dataset cases. This method yields centres that lie close to each other and to the general centroid of the data. RP - randomly selected points . k distinct cases of the data are randomly selected to be the initial centres. RUNFP - farthest points (running selection). First k cases are taken as centres and then during the run through the rest of the cases of the dataset there progressively replacements among the centres are done; the aim of the replacements is to obtain in the end k points most distant from each other in the variable space. These points (cases) occupying peripheral positions in the data cloud are the produced initial centres. (The method is used as the default in SPSS k-means procedure QUICK CLUSTER . See details in SPSS Algorithms.) SIMFP - farthest points (simple selection). The first centre is selected as a random case from the dataset. The 2nd centre is selected as the case maximally distant from that centre. The 3rd centre is selected as the case maximally distant from those two (from the nearest of the two), - and so on. KMPP - random farthest points, or k-means++. The first centre is selected as a random case from the dataset. The 2nd centre is selected also randomly, but the probability of selection of a case is proportional to the distance (square euclidean) of it to that (1st) centre.

Then the rest of the centres are selected from the data points in such a way that each point is considered as to whether it is closer (and how much, in terms of squared euclidean distance) to a set of points than each one of the latter is to any of the already existing centres. I.e. each point is examed as a candidate to represent some group of points not yet well enough represented by the centres already collected. Point most representative in this respect is selected as the next centre. (Kaufman, L. Rousseeuw, P.J. Finding groups in data: an introduction to cluster analysis., 1990. See also: Pena, J.M. et al. An empirical comparison of four initialization methods for the K-means algorithm // Pattern Recognition Lett. 20 (10), 1999, 1027-1040.) [There is also a nice method, not yet implemented by me in the macro, to generate k points which are from random uniform but \"less random than random\", somewhere between random and greed; see potential theoretical basis for that method] [One more method is to do hierarchical clustering by Ward's method. You may do it on subsample of objects if the sample is too big. Then means of the k clusters produced by it are the initial seeds for k-means procedure. Ward's is preferable over other hierarchical clustering methods because it shares the common target objective with k-means.] \nMethods RGC, RP, SIMFP, KMPP depend on random numbers and may change their result from run to run. \nMethod RUNFP may be sensitive to case order in the dataset; but method GREP is not (apart from occasions when there are many identical cases, ties, in the data). Method GREP may fail to collect all k centres if k is large relative the number of cases in the data ( n ), especially when k>n/2 . [The macro will inform if the data do not allow that method to collect k centres]. Method GREP is the slowest one, it computes [in my implementation] matrix of distances between all cases, therefore it won\u2019t suit if there are many tens of thousands or millions of cases. \nI'm not discussing presently which method is \"better\" and in what circumstance, because I haven't done extensive simulational probing of the question so far. My very preliminary and superficial impressions have been that GREP is particularly worthy (but it is expensive), and that if you want really cheap method still competitive enough, then just random k points, RP, is a decent choice.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arthur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l. rousseeuw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaufman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pena", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kmpp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grep", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recognition lett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rgc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vassilvitskii", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:34.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2921c308318dc044ac3f930e5c84f77b1823f92b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrDvgpEtNDI4nq9ap_ms4hcXXhpdC_UdQ1WUS9NKoBfcoLlfWpTbUMfhegWTA3EkOnrj7yDgDwlAstWrlWug.lqKA.H.xNl3E0yMM4hS9XT5PHptgc_uQMlxRNsXBNuXig-", "site_full": "bestgfx.org", "site": "bestgfx.org", "site_section": "http://bestgfx.org/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["photography", "graphics_software", "tech", "web_design_html", "hobbies_and_interests", "web_clip_art"], "section_title": "Free Download AE Project Vector Stock Web Template Photoshop Via Torrent Zippyshare", "title": "Ugly Sweater Digital Paper 1952899", "title_full": "Ugly Sweater Digital Paper 1952899", "published": "2017-12-07T01:16:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2921c308318dc044ac3f930e5c84f77b1823f92b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrDvgpEtNDI4nq9ap_ms4hcXXhpdC_UdQ1WUS9NKoBfcoLlfWpTbUMfhegWTA3EkOnrj7yDgDwlAstWrlWug.lqKA.H.xNl3E0yMM4hS9XT5PHptgc_uQMlxRNsXBNuXig-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mrsho", "published": "2017-12-07T01:16:00.000+02:00", "title": "Ugly Sweater Digital Paper 1952899", "text": "Direct Download : Ugly Sweater Digital Paper 1952899 Ugly Sweater Digital Paper 1952899   Ugly Sweater Digital Paper 1952899  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:34.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ec17b3527d00426ee55791015d727f6dbff26ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8v3BmVd24menPfZmoyJSBzxWUE48OGurGg2hDfKqPbzwl4tdFxAzIzifkiGRo8osyo0oTBYaQNwGkaX4CbpzSj4cML79SBO1yXPSau8dGTLHMT8NPc5WsK0hYoewC3LLRxLAK2Y0eJQ.VwJHAZeSu3", "site_full": "www.businesswire.com", "site": "businesswire.com", "site_section": "http://feed.businesswire.com/rss/home/?rss=G1QFDERJXkJeEVlZWA==", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Business Wire Health News", "title": "Chugai's Emicizumab Every Four Weeks Showed Positive Interim Results in Phase III Study", "title_full": "Chugai's Emicizumab Every Four Weeks Showed Positive Interim Results in Phase III Study | Business Wire", "published": "2017-12-07T14:45:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://mms.businesswire.com/media/20171206006484/en/502812/2/%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%96_%E3%82%B3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9D%E3%83%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B4_EN.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5013, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 27}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ec17b3527d00426ee55791015d727f6dbff26ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8v3BmVd24menPfZmoyJSBzxWUE48OGurGg2hDfKqPbzwl4tdFxAzIzifkiGRo8osyo0oTBYaQNwGkaX4CbpzSj4cML79SBO1yXPSau8dGTLHMT8NPc5WsK0hYoewC3LLRxLAK2Y0eJQ.VwJHAZeSu3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "http://www.businesswire.com/", "published": "2017-12-07T14:45:00.000+02:00", "title": "Chugai's Emicizumab Every Four Weeks Showed Positive Interim Results in Phase III Study", "text": "TOKYO-  Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (TOKYO:4519) announced today that positive interim results have been reported from the global phase III HAVEN 4 study (NCT03020160) for emicizumab (ACE910) subcutaneous injection, every four weeks, in patients with hemophilia A (12 years of age or older) with and without inhibitors to factor VIII. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of emicizumab prophylaxis. At this interim analysis after a median of 17 weeks of treatment, emicizumab prophylaxis demonstrated a clinically meaningful control of bleeding over time. \n\nThese results from HAVEN 4 are consistent with previous studies of emicizumab dosed once weekly or every two weeks to evaluate the reduction of bleed rate, including the pivotal studies in hemophilia A with inhibitors, phase III HAVEN 1 study (NCT02622321) in adults and adolescents and phase III HAVEN 2 study (NCT02795767) in children, as well as the phase III HAVEN 3 study (NCT02847637) in adults and adolescents (12 years of age or older) with hemophilia A without inhibitors. The most common adverse events with emicizumab were injection site reactions, with no new safety signals observed. No thrombotic microangiopathy or thrombotic events have been reported in this study. Further details will be presented at a future medical meeting. These results will be submitted to health authorities around the world for approval consideration. \n\u201cIf emicizumab prophylaxis once every four weeks is proven to be effective in controlling bleeding regardless of the inhibitor status to factor VIII, it would advance the possibility to further prolong the administration interval of emicizumab,\u201d said Chugai\u2019s Senior Vice President, Head of Project & Lifecycle Management Unit, Dr. Yasushi Ito. \u201cThese interim results represent the potential to ease the burden surrounding hemophilia treatment experienced by patients or their family in their daily life and to increase the medical value of emicizumab.\u201d \nEmicizumab is an investigational bispecific monoclonal antibody, which was developed using Chugai\u2019s proprietary antibody engineering technologies. The drug is designed to bind factor lXa and factor X. In doing so, emicizumab provides the cofactor function of factor VIII in people with hemophilia A, who either lack or have impaired coagulation function of factor Vlll 1,2) . In November this year, the drug (US product name: HEMLIBRA \u00ae ; Genentech) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u201cfor routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adult and pediatric patients with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) with factor VIII inhibitors\u201d. An EU marketing authorization application was submitted in June 2017 and is being reviewed under Accelerated Assessment by the European Medicines Agency. In Japan, emicizumab obtained an orphan drug designation in August 2016 from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for the prevention and reduction of bleeding episodes in patients with congenital factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) who developed inhibitors to FVIII, followed by an application for regulatory approval filed in July 2017. \nAbout HAVEN 4 study (NCT03020160) \nHAVEN 4 study is a single-arm, multicentre, open-label, phase III study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous administration of emicizumab dosed every four weeks. The study included 48 patients (12 years of age or older) with hemophilia A with or without inhibitors to factor VIII who were previously treated with either on-demand or prophylactic factor VIII or bypassing agents, depending on their inhibitor status. The primary endpoint of the study is the bleed rate with emicizumab prophylaxis and secondary endpoints include joint bleed rate, target joint bleed rate, health-related quality of life (HRQoL)/ health status, and safety. \n[Study Design]\nPatients with or without inhibitors to factor VIII previously treated with either on-demand or prophylactic factor VIII or bypassing agents were enrolled in two cohorts. The study was conducted in two stages as follows; \nPatients Objective Treatment Regimen Pharmacokinetic\n(PK) run-in\ncohort\n(n=7) \nEvaluate pharmacokinetics Received emicizumab prophylaxis at 6mg/kg once every 4 weeks Expansion\ncohort\n(n=41) \nEvaluate efficacy and safety Received emicizumab prophylaxis at 3mg/kg once every week for 4 weeks, followed by 6mg/kg once every 4 weeks The evaluation of pharmacokinetics was conducted after monitoring all seven patients in a PK run-in cohort at least six weeks since they had initiated the administration of emicizumab, and followed by an expansion cohort study. Episodic treatment of breakthrough bleeds with factor VIII therapy was allowed per protocol. \nAbout Chugai \nChugai Pharmaceutical is one of Japan\u2019s leading research-based pharmaceutical companies with strengths in biotechnology products.

Hunting the same stand the next day, a rare piebald buck responded to his call. Macol said he\u2019d encountered the buck on the first day of the season, but didn\u2019t get a clear shot. This time, he hit it broadside. \u201cWe tracked it about two miles; I thought my shot was in a better place,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have waited longer; we caught up to it and bumped it, and he took off, so we had to track it in the morning.

SPAR Cross-Europameisterschaften in Samorin unweit von Bratislava zum ultimativen Showdown der Mittel- und Langstreckenl\u00e4ufer werden. \nNahezu alle Medaillengewinner der 2017 ausgetragenen Europameisterschaften der U23 (in Bydgoszcz) und U20 (in Grosseto) werden im x-bionic sphere-Komplex in Samorin unter den 576 Teilnehmern aus 37 Nationen an der Startlinie stehen, bei den M\u00e4nnern und Frauen hingegen sind nur wenige der bei den Weltmeisterschaften in London in der erweiterten Spitze aufgetauchten Topl\u00e4ufer in der Slowakei dabei. \nNach dem furiosen Auftritt der deutschen L\u00e4ufer bei den letztj\u00e4hrigen Titelk\u00e4mpfen in Chia (Italien) mit der Goldmedaille f\u00fcr Konstanze Klosterhalfen (U20) und den drei Silbermedaillen f\u00fcr Anna Gehring (U23) und die Juniorinnen-Teams U23 und U20 sind die Erwartungen mindestens \u00e4hnlich hoch wie im Vorjahr. \n\u201eWir wollen eine Medaille\u201c hatte Alina Reh noch nach ihrem begeisternden Spurtsieg gegen Konstanze Klosterhalfen in aller Bescheidenheit beim Darmstadt-Cross gesagt \u2013 und meinte damit vorrangig die Teammedaille im U23-Wettbewerb. \nUnausgesprochen dabei die gro\u00dfartigen Chancen auf eine Einzelmedaille \u00fcber die 6.280 m lange U23-Strecke. Da die aus \u00c4thiopien stammende f\u00fcr die T\u00fcrkei startende Yasemin Can ihren in Chia gewonnenen Frauen-Titel in Samorin verteidigen m\u00f6chte und somit nicht altersgem\u00e4ss im U23-Bereich antreten wird, treffen praktisch alle weiteren Medaillengewinnerinnen der U23-EM aus Bydgoszcz im Kampf um die Cross-Medaillen aufeinander. \nDazu z\u00e4hlen neben der 1500 m-Titeltr\u00e4gerin Konstanze Klosterhalfen ihre deutsche Teamkollegin Alina Reh als 5000 m-Zweite, Anna Emilie M\u00f6ller (D\u00e4nemark) als 3000 m-Hindernis-Meisterin und zudem Nataliya Strebkova (Ukraine), B\u00fcsra Nur Koku (T\u00fcrkei), Emine Hatun Tuna (T\u00fcrkei), Weronika Pyzik (Polen), Phoebe Law (Gro\u00df-Britannien) und Emma Oudiou (Frankreich). \nSpannung verspricht zudem die Teamwertung, bei der Deutschland zudem mit der letztj\u00e4hrigen U23-Vize-Europameisterin Anna Gehring, Vera Coutellier und Svenja Pingpank eine Medaille ebenso sicher haben sollte wie Gro\u00dfbritannien und die T\u00fcrkei \u2013 nur der Kampf um die Farbe verspricht \u00fcberaus spannend zu werden. \n\u00c4hnlich spannend d\u00fcrfte das Rennen der U20-Juniorinnen \u00fcber 4.210 m zu werden. Hier treffen mit Jasmijn Lau (Niederlande) und Delia Sclabas (Schweiz) zwei Europameisterinnen von Grosseto aufeinander, zudem die Britin Harriet Knowles-Jones als zweifache Cross-Medaillengewinnerin (2015, 2016). \nIhre Chance hat allerdings auch die 5000 m-EM-Zweite Miriam Dattke, vor allem wenn sie einen \u00e4hnlichen \u201eSahnetag\u201c erwischen sollte wie beim Darmstadt-Cross, als sie Delia Sclabas deutlich bezwingen konnte. Mit Josina Papenfu\u00df, Lisa Tertsch, Linn Lara Kleine und Johanna Flacke schickt der DLV ein Team ins Rennen, das die Tradition der Teammedaille in dieser Altersklasse fortsetzen sollte. \nEin weiterer H\u00f6hepunkt wird das Rennen der U23-Junioren \u00fcber 8230 m werden. Hier treffen zum Beispiel die f\u00fcnf Erstpatzierten des 5000 m-EM-Finales von Bydgoszcz mit Yemaneberhan Crippa (Italien), Simon Debognies (Belgien), Carlos Mayo (Spanien), Amanal Petros (Deutschland) und Hugo Hay (Frankreich) und zudem Hindernis-Europameister Yohanes Chiapinelli (Italien) aufeinander. \nBei seinem Sieg in Darmstadt konnte Amanal Petros zeigen, dass er nach der Bundeswehr-Grundausbildung wieder pr\u00e4chtig in Schuss ist, sodass er im dritten Anlauf durchaus auch zu einer ersten Cross-Medaille kommen k\u00f6nnte. Im Sommer war er bereits als EM-Zweiter \u00fcber 10.000 m (hinter Carlos Mayo) erfolgreich. \nAuf ein gutes Mannschaftsresultat hofft man beim DLV durch den Einsatz von Patrick Karl, Kidane Tewolde, Jonathan Dahlke und Karl Junghann\u00df, der \u00fcbrigens in Bydgoszcz Silber im 20 km-Gehen gewann. \nIm U20-Juniorenrennen \u00fcber 6280 m scheint mit dem Titelverteidiger Jakob Ingebrigtsen (Norwegen) der Sieger schon ausgemacht, denn der erst 17j\u00e4hrige gewann im Sommer gleich zwei Titel in Grosseto (5000 m/ 3000 m Hindernis). Am ehesten scheint dem Supertalent der Familie Ingebrigtsen noch der 10.000 m-Europameister Dorin Andrei Rusu (Rum\u00e4nien) nahe kommen zu k\u00f6nnen. \nF\u00fcr die deutschen Nachwuchsl\u00e4ufer Robert Baumann, Markus G\u00f6rger, Nick J\u00e4ger, Mohamed Mohumed und Steffen Ulmrich geht es vorrangig um eine gute Teamplatzierung im Feld der insgesamt 111 L\u00e4ufer aus 31 Nationen, dem gr\u00f6\u00dften Feld der Titelk\u00e4mpfe. \nWer sonst au\u00dfer Yasemin Can? Die t\u00fcrkische Titelverteidigerin trifft auf dem Weg zum Gold im Frauenwettbewerb (8230 m) auf alle Konkurrentinnen aus dem Vorjahr der Pl\u00e4tze zwei bis acht, darunter auch die stark verbesserte Vorjahresdritte Karoline Grovdal (Norwegen) oder die unverw\u00fcstliche Fionnuala McCormack (geborene Britton) als fr\u00fchere Titeltr\u00e4gerin, letztj\u00e4hrige F\u00fcnfte bei ihrem insgesamt 15. Start bei Cross-Europameisterschaften. \nDer DLV setzt wiederum nach der Qualifikation von Tilburg (Niederlande) auf Fabienne Amrhein, Caterina Granz, Maya Rehberg, Jana Sussmann und die deutsche Hochschulmeisterin und Pforzheim-Erste Elena Burkard . \nBei den M\u00e4nnern (10.180 m) ist der Hallen-EM-Dritte Richard Ringer Einzelstarter, da sich beim Qualifikationsrennen in Tilburg kein weiterer deutscher L\u00e4ufer empfehlen konnte. Er trifft in Samorin auf ein erlesenes Starterfeld, das von den beiden aus Kenia stammenden T\u00fcrken Aras Kaya (Titelverteidiger) und Polat Kemboi Arikan sowie von Andrew Butchart, Andy Vernon (beide Gro\u00df-Britannien), Adel Mechaal (Spanien) und den Br\u00fcdern Filip und Henrik Ingebrigtsen (Norwegen) angef\u00fchrt wird. \nIm insgesamt 30k\u00f6pfigen Aufgebot des Deutschen Leichtathletik-Verbandes stehen auch mit Denise Krebs, Diana Sujew, Maximilian Thorwirth und dem U23-Europameister \u00fcber 1500 m Marius Probst vier Starter f\u00fcr den erstmals zur Austragung kommenden Mixed-Staffel-Wettbewerb \u00fcber 6.280 m. \nWilfried Raatz ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name":

Pachico, 80, died unexpectedly on Dec. 4, 2017. \nHe was born on Jan. 23, 1937, in Vineyard Haven to Frank A. and Gladys (Brooks) Pachico. \nMelvin enlisted in the U.S. Army at age 18 in 1955, returning to the Vineyard after his tour of duty in the States at the Boston Missile Defense site. \nMelvin was happiest when working. His many professions included working as a chef at Home Port Restaurant for owners Chester Stearns and Chet Cummens; an apprentice embalmer at Sylvia Funeral Home; a landscaper for Allen Gelinas; he then operated his own landscaping and caretaking business for more than 35 years. He was a jack-of-all-trades, painting and acquiring his contractor\u2019s license. He, along with his brother Donald, replaced many an Island roof. He retired in 2002. \nMelvin enjoyed children, and was known to tease a few. He was known for his chocolate chip cookies, he made for many of them. Pictures of his cookies often appeared on Facebook, as they were so large. \nHe was a member of the Holy Ghost Association. Winters were spent with his wife, Judith, in Port Richey, Fla. \nHe was predeceased by his parents, his brother Frank A. Pachico Jr. and wife (Catherine), his sisters Lillian Burovac and Susan Jackson, his brother-in-laws Phil Dube, Timothy Fullin, and Arthur Metell, and two nieces and one nephew. He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Judith (Marchant) Pachico; his two daughters, Janet Sylvia (Timothy) and Kimberly Serpa (Eric), all of West Tisbury, and five grandchildren, Brandyn Sylvia, Brianna Sylvia Olender (Bill), Zachary Sylvia, Caitlin and Christopher Serpa; and a great-granddaughter, Alyssa Sylvia.

You may remember that both women are pregnant, and both women should not be pregnant: Mary because she is unmarried, and Elizabeth because she is barren. I have always assumed she is barren because she is older. One version of Luke (earlier in chapter one) notes that Elizabeth and her husband are \"very old.\" Some years, it's Mary's part of the story that speaks to me: a young woman, inexperienced, still under control of her elders, with something strange happening. This year, I confess it's Elizabeth. I think of all the ways that one's body changes not only with adolescence, but with old age. I think of my own 52 year old feet, not swollen with pregnancy, but with arthritis. I cannot imagine pregnancy right now. And Elizabeth was older than I am. I spent my younger years declaring that biology isn't destiny: we can do whatever we want, no matter what bodies we inhabit. My middle-aged self is willing to admit that biology is often destiny, in ways we can't imagine when we're young. I'm seeing too many people at the mercy of bodies that they have increasingly less control over. I've seen far too many people ravaged by the cancer cells that take over. But the Mary and Elizabeth story reminds us of the body's miraculous capacity. This year, I'm focused on life springing from improbable places. I'm thinking of these pregnancies as metaphors, and it's Elizabeth's pregnancy that speaks to me this year. In a culture like ours that worships youth and beauty, it is good to remember that God doesn't discard us when we might think we've outlived our usefulness. We may look at our past decades and sigh over what we have not achieved. God looks at us and sees so much potential. Let us be like Mary and say yes to God. Let us be like Elizabeth, ready for a new life, even if we're not sure exactly where it will take us.

The williwaw, surely the strangest named of them all, is no exception. \nThis odd word first appears in early nineteenth-century accounts of voyages through mountainous seas and evil winds to round Cape Horn. One was by Robert FitzRoy, captain of the Beagle during his first voyage in 1829, which preceded the famous one with Charles Darwin: \u201cThe williwaws (I know no better name for the sudden gusts that come off the high land) gave us some trouble, occasionally laying us almost on our beam ends.\u201d \nAt the end of the century another intrepid sailor traversed the same region: Here I had my first experience with the terrific squalls, called williwaws, which extended from this point on through the strait to the Pacific. They were compressed gales of wind that Boreas handed down over the hills in chunks. A full-blown williwaw will throw a ship, even without sail on, over on her beam ends; but, like other gales, they cease now and then, if only for a short time. Sailing Alone Around The World , by Joshua Slocum, 1900. \nThe name has since been applied to a similar phenomenon in other places, in particular the Aleutian Islands (Gore Vidal, who died in August 2012, wrote his first novel, Williwaw , after serving there as master of an Army F-S boat during the Second World War). It\u2019s now understood that williwaws come about when air that has been cooled and made more dense on the upper reaches of a mountain roars down steep slopes to the sea. In meteorological terminology, such winds are katabatic (Greek katabatikos , from katabainein , to go down). \nWilliwaw is said to have been named by sealers and whalers in the area of the Straits of Magellan around 1800. Nobody seems to have the slightest idea where the word came from. The only hint I can uncover is from a writer in the Gardener\u2019s Magazine in December 1839, who commented that williwaw was the usual Patagonian term for it. Presumably it was borrowed from a native language no longer known to us.

I am more familiar with the terms like \"fixed effects\" and \"random effects\" in context of econometrics and the analysis of panel data. \nThe understanding of \"random effects\" seems similar in both disciplines and the \"random effects model\" in econometrics is equivalent to a \"mixed model with random intercept\". See for example: How exactly does a \"random effects model\" in econometrics relate to mixed models outside of econometrics? \nBut what is about the \"fixed effect\". In econometrics, with the help of fixed effects e.g. all time invariant effects will be absorbed. Or in other words, a dummy variable for each individual is introduced. \nBut, what is \"fixed effect\" in context of mixed models? In simple words? Hereby, I mean more the intuition and not the mathematically way. \nIt is not the same as a fixed effect in econometrics. That is what I understand, but I have no clue what it is instead. \nEDIT: \nMeanwhile I found this explanation in context of mixed models: \n\"The fixed effects are analogous to standard regression coefficients and are estimated directly.\" \nThis means to me, that a fixed effect in mixed models is not the same as fixed effects in econometrics. Or in other words: Fixed effects are the variables that are not declared as random effects (--> standard regression coefficients as in linear regression). \nSource (slide 2): http://fmwww.bc.edu/EC-C/S2013/823/EC823.S2013.nn07.slides.pdf", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:35.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ae4c051ac24e78d1ec9111c9b793c53177c35ef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYuSM1AWQ3j4he4oGH7AeLidMZ8Ix8hEkEEWwoGnz7IPBFNexZh8ZwmKCFFPl9ElvrzPqRO_VxrayeLIMxy4WXcsh_JEZWsLl5A-", "site_full": "jane-janesjournal.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://jane-janesjournal.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Jane's Journal", "title": "The trees have arrived", "title_full": "The trees have arrived", "published": "2017-12-07T08:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a77b5a1748a92c2abaac5aec2bf18a13c80fe7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYuSM1AWQ3j4he4oGH7AeLidMZ8Ix8hEkEEWwoGnz7IPBFNexZh8ZwmKCFFPl9ElvrzPqRO_VxrayeLIMxy4WXcsxXBOpSyEN9Yr_mGZHTP3QQ--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "SumBunneh", "published": "2017-12-07T09:46:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Ohhh Billy, what splendid friends you have visiting...

Next June, four more Island teacher/residents will receive masters of education. \nThe graduates are the first in decades who did not leave the Island to pursue higher education, courtesy of a new program developed by Adult and Continuing Education (ACE MV) and FSU to bring education to the Island. \nACE MV and FSU celebrated their first class of masters\u2019 candidates on Nov. 30 at the Harbor View Hotel, attended by the grads, their on-Island professors, ACE MV staff, and FSU representatives, led by Lisa Moison, who directs the FSU educational outreach program. \n\u201cFSU has 40 off-campus partnerships, of which only six are degree-conferring. Sam Hart and the superintendent of schools [Matt D\u2019Andrea] articulated the Island need clearly,\u201d Ms. Moison said this week. \nFSU offered students a combination online and classroom curriculum, selecting four veteran \non-Island educators with teaching experience at the college and university level. Lynn Ditchfield, Margaret (Peg) Regan, Marge Harris, and Suzanne Alberich were vetted and selected by FSU as adjunct professors. \nSam Hart, executive director of ACE MV, said the program benefits prospective students, the Island educational system, and the community. It began in January 2016. \n\u201cThe program complies with new state laws regarding teaching licensure, and allows our professionals to advance educationally without having to leave the Island at significant cost to them, the schools, and the towns which support them,\u201d Mr. Hart said. \u201cMy master\u2019s cost me $36,000. The FSU/ACE MV program costs $12,000, and saves on tuition and travel reimbursement, hiring substitute teachers to take classrooms when candidates are off-Island.\u201d \nThe teacher graduates and their Island schools are Jennifer Fournier and Ryan Leandro (Edgartown School); Melissa Braillard, Mary Lee Carlomagno, Olsen Houghton, Jane McGroarty Sampaio, Tiffiney Shoquist, Elsbeth Todd (MVRHS); Emily Anderson, Julie Brand, Sean DeBettencourt, Hope Fecitt, Reuben Fitzgerald, Meredith Goldthwait (Tisbury School); Kristen Parece, Brian Roesler (West Tisbury); Brooke Evans, Kathryn Phelps (Bridge program), Lorena Crespo (Head Start) and Janet Holladay (not teaching).

On my 335i I have MHD stage 2+ with the O2 monitor turned off, have always been able to pass as MA allows 1 not ready, so no issues.\nBack to the Merc - they now check with the connection to the car if any monitors are turned off that normally should not be turned off. Since I had them off on the Beta tune, they flagged the car as having a tune due to the monitor being disabled. They don't tell the station this, so the station calls, they say maybe something wrong with the registration, I call and get that checked, no issues, call the assistance center they say nothing is wrong, so go back, car won't let the inspection start, went through this 3 times, then they finally referred me to the mac center - guy calls me an hour later and asks if I have a tune, I fess up that I did and he says flash back to stock, bring it in and they will check and unflag the car and then it can be inspected.\nSo, long story short, you can no longer have any monitors disabled as they will flag the car. You will have to flash back to stock and run a DP fix if you have DP's and you will probably be ok, but don't rely on the one not ready as they know it is disabled and not just not ready. They also claim stock exhaust must be in place, but that is easier to overlook if you get a lax shop, they can't overlook anything the computer does nor can they over ride it. Fuckers...so now I have to buy a DP fix. Be interesting to hear if other people have this same issue.

Erica from Whimsical September is cohosting today, so be sure to swing by her blog because she has made some really great gift guides the last couple of weeks! \n\nToday's post won't be full of pictures and links because I had my small group Christmas party last night and didn't have time to make a really great post.  Today's post will be full of ideas! \n\n\n\n\nA couple of disclaimers: \n\nTeachers DO NOT expect any gifts ever, so we are always so surprised and appreciative of anything we receive! Gifts for elementary teachers won't work for secondary teachers because your child most likely has one teacher in elementary and multiple in secondary, so gift prices obviously go down. Gift Ideas for Elementary Teachers: A gift card to get a basic manicure--these are $15 or less and will be much appreciated!! Luxury lotion A themed gift basket set--nails, coffee, teas, movie night, etc. Gift cards to anywhere!! \nGift Ideas for Secondary Teachers: $5 gift card to Starbucks Redbox gift card with a box of movie theater popcorn monogrammed tumbler coffee cup with box of hot chocolate Bath and Body Works soap or lotion Cookies from a local bakery You don't have to spend a ton of money to make a teacher feel loved and appreciated!  Hopefully some of these ideas work well for you!  I typically shy away from making homemade goodies for the teacher unless that teacher knows you personally.  I hate to say this, but a lot of teachers don't eat food given to them by students if we don't know the parents and how clean they are.  It's hard to want to eat food from a kid that we've seen pick his/her nose in our class. \n\n\n<!-- end InLinkz script \u2014>", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "victoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erica", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "starbucks redbox", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:35.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "07e76156b1c155709c350aaffd67e71c31e0ef96", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQApyRnPnOVUrMNlF5oGElvK9sXi.Yfpzi1bzLheIV6Fw--", "site_full": "vk.com", "site": "vk.com", "site_section": "https://vk.com/id457673317", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Tanya Milakina", "title": "Tanya Milakina", "title_full": "Tanya Milakina", "published": "2017-12-03T04:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "RU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 21, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d34268a4c086dc49a14c26959e5dcb87a77194c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQApyRnPnOVUrMNlF5oGElvK9sXi.Yfpzj8GpV5S5pwDA--", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Karina Sadykova", "published": "2017-12-04T08:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "4", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:30:35.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a26cf9a7bd592b7da9c074645d662bd89e047288", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz_2WCFUvvxVUHwbOHKl3RovuqtFCAHMileTzLAILdV_lofQtaFr2K1gQzepQMBazp3VhqfTN6myW42xsNGw247", "site_full": "freekabalance.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://freekabalance.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Ka Balance", "title": "Quaker Oats Pouch, 1kg", "title_full": "Quaker Oats Pouch, 1kg", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a26cf9a7bd592b7da9c074645d662bd89e047288", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz_2WCFUvvxVUHwbOHKl3RovuqtFCAHMileTzLAILdV_lofQtaFr2K1gQzepQMBazp3VhqfTN6myW42xsNGw247", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Freekabalance Blog (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Quaker Oats Pouch, 1kg", "text": "\n\nAmazon offers its Quaker Oats Pouch, 1kg for Rs.149.

She\u2019s just the opposite. She\u2019s funny, engaging, and has a great outlook on life \u2014 determined to do the things that she was doing before that collision with a dump truck severed her leg. \n\u201cThis summer my goal was to get back in shape,\u201d she said at her meeting with EMTs. \u201cEver since I got my running leg, I\u2019ve been surprising myself. I cut better on my [prosthetic] leg than I do on my other one. I don\u2019t even think about it anymore.\u201d \nShe fully expects to be back on her team this spring playing lacrosse. Amazing. \nLater that week, we were at an event with some other pretty amazing people \u2014 the Dunkls. We were in the audience watching as they reluctantly accepted the award for their contributions to the Island community by the Permanent Endowment of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, earning the Ruth Bogan \u2013 Ruth Redding Memorial Fund Creative Living Award. \nWe say reluctantly, because nearly everyone who spoke about the Dunkls said the same thing. They like to be in the background, out of the spotlight, doing their good work. \nYou look at the Dunkls \u2014 Frank, Peter, and Heidi \u2014 and it\u2019s easy to pass them over as just another family descended from immigrants. They fit nicely into the woven fabric of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, and that\u2019s just the way they like it. \nBut if you pass them over, you miss an incredible tale of a compassionate, kind, hard-working trio invested in conservation, culture, and giving back. You miss what really made America great \u2014 ingenuity, craftsmanship, thoughtfulness \u2014 not the trumped-up slogan of a political campaign. \nJust how difficult was it to recognize this family\u2019s good work? Emily Bramhall, executive for the Permanent Endowment, talked about that in introducing them as this year\u2019s winners. She had to come up with convincing information, and, at the end of the day, even do a little arm-twisting to get them to accept the award. \nNo shameless self-promotion. No endless press releases seeking recognition for their good works. Just humble, behind-the-scenes hard work and ingenuity. \nIt was great to see the community respond, so many friends crammed into the Portuguese-American Club in Oak Bluffs to honor the Dunkls. You could tell they were uneasy about all the attention and the accolades. But by the end of the evening, you could also tell it was all well deserved. \nWe were struck by something Frank Dunkl told us hours before the event on a visit to The Times office. \n\u201cFor generations it\u2019s been our family policy to never knowingly hurt people and to help wherever possible,\u201d he said. \nThose are pretty good words to live by.

Fence opponents have presented the commission and the advisory board with several petitions, and have been a vocal presence at public meetings this fall. \nAt an Oct. 18 public hearing, opponents asked Land Bank staff and board members to consider the dramatic improvement of the property in recent years, which they said is due in part to 95 percent compliance of Land Bank rules. \nA permit for the fence from the National Heritage and Endangered Species Program (NHESP) was granted on Nov. 8. \nLand Bank executive director James Lengyel said the ultimate decision is up to the Land Bank Commission, which will meet Monday, at 1 p.m. at Land Bank Headquarters, 167 Main St. in Edgartown. \nAccording to Land Bank biologist Julie Russell, the runway and taxiway at Trade Wind are home to rare flora and fauna \u2014 the New England blazing star, sandplain blue-eyed grass, and purple tiger beetle \u2014 which are designated as species of \u201cspecial concern\u201d by NHESP, and also to purple needlegrass, which is classified as \u201cthreatened.\u201d The New England blazing star was discovered just this summer by Ms. Russell. \nIn other business, Oak Bluffs planning board chairman Ewell Hopkins will replace advisory board chairman Tom Zinno, who is stepping down. The board will vote on a new chairman. \nUpdated because the time and location of the meeting changed.
