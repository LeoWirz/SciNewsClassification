America as you think of it was born dead and only by educating a sizeable portion of the people can we give it life. As it is now, it is just about dead forever and some of us have awakened to that fact. We need every red blooded lover of freedom to get educated and do it as fast as possible. Then we need to form an army of patriots to go forth and demand everyone they know to get educated with us. This is no joke! \nWhile we were sleeping and distracted with the good life our so called politicians have been stealing us blind and making it impossible to continue enjoying the life-style we were promised; one of prosperity and happiness. \nHave you not noticed the haughty attitude of your representatives as they go about destroying our country? Do you still not know that a lawyer is your enemy and works for the court? Do you not know it will be impossible to choose your own doctor in the near future, and your children are NOT yours to protect? \nIf it was not for your infatuation with family duties, entertainment and leisure time you would probably have noticed that you are in fact a slave to the powers that really run our country. They literally claim to own us, and that fact is irrefutable. Now I know many of you consider yourselves loyal Americans due to what you have been taught all your life, but common sense should tell you that something is drastically wrong, and it is , but you must do the home work to discover the reasons and methods they used to do it. \nFortunately there are people who have done the research and found out all the details of this unspeakable theft of our lives, property and prosperity, so all you have to do is get off your back side and get educated by reading their material. \nLet me refer you to Anna Von Reitz and her web-site with almost eight hundred short articles that anyone with half a brain can understand. \nhttp://www.annavonreitz.com/ Read everything on this site! \nThis is a grandmother who also has a husband that is our legal Head of State and Postmaster which most of you may not know is a legal part of our original political system. They are rebuilding our original form of government and need our help, which is getting educated and helping others to do the same. \nI know how crazy this must sound to most of you, just as it did to me some years back, but take it to the bank folks it is either get educated our lose all of your family, possessions, freedom, wealth, and health. If you cannot see the need to know the facts surrounding Americas fall, then you of all people need to study and learn the truth about America. It will soon be gone forever without as sizeable population of informed people. You won\u2019t know what hit you when the crap hits the fan. \n\u201cYou Know Something Is Wrong When\u2026 An American Affidavit of Probable Cause\u201d is the blockbuster you need to read. This book blows the lid off the corrupt corporate entity calling itself our Federal government, and shows the entire history of Fraud, Deception, Threat, Duress, Coercion, and Intimidation the perpeTRAITORS have used to steal our entire heritage and prosperity for over 150 years: Get it Here at Amazon", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anna von reitz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "americas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:25.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "94c9de941cd4aaa4540186b4c476c71f7d8713ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8mVVPX3tlR.Hj25Z1HTqsC0anr2JCyXzja.LIg1Jxa2GgTuQlev.RK", "site_full": "www.ifljapan.com", "site": "ifljapan.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "", "title": "japanese porn - I Fucking Love Japan", "title_full": "japanese porn - I Fucking Love Japan", "published": "2017-12-07T10:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.621, "main_image": "http://cdn.ifljapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/japanese-porn_01-2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "94c9de941cd4aaa4540186b4c476c71f7d8713ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8mVVPX3tlR.Hj25Z1HTqsC0anr2JCyXzja.LIg1Jxa2GgTuQlev.RK", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "japanese porn - I Fucking Love Japan", "text": "\u00a9 2017 All models on IFLJAPAN.com adult site are 18 years or older.

Steve Justice, a 53-year-old plant operator, was fatally injured when he exited his personal service truck near a generator trailer and the service truck rolled forward, pinning him between the truck and the trailer. \nThe investigation showed that Justice, who had been residing in a travel trailer on the mine site for two weeks prior to the accident, turned on the generator to get gas for his vehicle sometime between 4:15 p.m. and 7:40 p.m. on Friday, March 24 and left it running. When the security guard arrived at approximately 7:40 p.m., he noticed the plant light was on, so he went to the generator trailer and turned the plant light off. He then went to Justice\u2019s trailer to see if Justice wanted him to turn off the generator, but Justice said he would take care of it, so the security guard worked his shift and left the mine at approximately 4:45 a.m. on Saturday, March 25. \nOn Monday, March 27, a front-end loader operator arrived at approximately 5:45 a.m. to begin work and noticed Justice\u2019s truck near the generator trailer. When he approached the truck, he found Justice pinned between the truck and generator. Emergency medical crews and law enforcement arrived at approximately 6:15 a.m. and pronounced Justice dead a short time later. The official cause of death was traumatic asphyxia. \n\nThe investigation concluded that sometime after 7:40 pm on Friday, March 24, Justice drove to the generator trailer, exited the cab with the truck running and in gear, and walked between the truck and trailer with his back to the truck. Because of the ground slope, the truck rolled forward and pinned Justice between the truck and the trailer, resulting in his death. Related \nThe Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) issued a Fatalgram after a miner was pinned between his own truck and a genset. On Friday, March ... \nThe following root cause and corrective action were identified: \nRoot Cause: Management\u2019s policies and work practices were inadequate and failed to ensure parking procedures were followed when leaving mobile equipment unattended. \nCorrective Action: Management has developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) on parking procedures for unattended mobile equipment. Mine management has provided training to all employees on the new SOP and will be including it in their Site-Specific Hazard Awareness Program to address all other vehicular traffic on the mine site. \nThe company received one order and two citations.

India is likely to export nearly one-fifth less cotton than previously estimated as pink bollworms are set to eat into the south Asian country's output which was expected to hit a record, industry officials told Reuters in late November. \"Cotton has a pretty substantial long position already ... there really are some fundamentals behind the market that continue to keep cotton with a bid,\" the trader noted. Meanwhile, the market awaited export sales data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture due on Thursday. Total futures market volume fell by 9,389 to 18,496 lots. Total open interest gained 473 to 249,201 contracts in the previous session, data showed.

Please know that if you find you are no longer able to keep your pet, you have options. To learn more about alternatives to surrender, check out our Surrender Checklist . To surrender your pet to LCAS, please note the following guidelines: Cats and dogs should be up to date on their rabies vaccination prior to surrender. Pets that arrive with current rabies vaccinations are able to move more quickly through the medical and behavioral assessment process shortening their stay in the shelter. Help us, help your pet \u2013 ensure their rabies vaccine is up to date before surrender. If you need need assistance finding low-cost vaccination options, check out our Low-Cost Resource Flyer . Pets can only be accepted from Loudoun County residents over the age of 18. Proof of age and residency will be required. While pets can be surrendered anytime during normal business hours , we do ask that residents make an appointment to surrender a pet by calling us at 703-777-0406 When you come to the shelter to surrender your pet, please bring proof that you own the pet. This can be in the form of: Bill of sale Written transfer of ownership Surrendering Checklist Before arriving at the shelter to surrender a pet, please take a moment to review the following checklist. If you have questions about surrendering a pet, please contact us at 703-777-0406 or by email . If you are thinking about surrendering your pet, please first consider using the following resources: Have you notified friends, family members, neighbors and coworkers that you need to find a new home for your pet? More often than not, this type of networking can have very positive results. Plus, you may even get to visit on occasion if you find your pet a new home within your social network. Have you contacted a rescue group about taking your pet? If you are having behavioral challenges with your pet, have you contacted our shelter by email or phone, 703-777-0406? We have a Behavior Program Manager on staff, and she is a great resource for challenges you may be experiencing. If you rent and need assistance with pet friendly housing, have you investigated options? Try visiting one of many websites tailored to the needs of pet owners, such as peoplewithpets.com , which save you time by allowing you to search for \"pet friendly\" apartments in various communities in your target price range and with the amenities you specify. If you have allergies, have you had a conversation with your doctor? Pet allergies are a common problem. The good news is that today your allergist or veterinarian can recommend many helpful products and tips to \"lose\" the allergies, rather than your pet. Are you a Loudoun resident? Are you over the age of 18? Have you scheduled a specific time with the shelter staff to surrender your pet? Do you have proof of ownership for your pet? It is helpful to the pet to come into the shelter with current vaccinations. If your cat or dog does not have current vaccinations, please see your veterinarian prior to surrendering to the shelter. Please bring a small bag of your pet's current food with you to the shelter. This bag of food will help us transition your pet to the shelter's food and minimize the occurrence of stomach upset. In order to do the best job possible for your pet, we ask owners to complete a personality profile prior to arrival at the shelter. This profile gives us important information regarding how your pet behaved in your home.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "loudoun county animal services", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "loudoun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loudoun county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:27.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fcbb6881061e3a21566764828a47f31d77c2b509", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS6ap0AJGLfHTxl666Rcg0XQQOUf0nf6FgxJ.eniWyu9sNsd4oUM38v..VFjbMhESkSb1A_xV.WvJMD13ejcM9u7oWO4AypM5M-", "site_full": "ocala.craigslist.org", "site": "craigslist.org", "site_section": "http://ocala.craigslist.org/search/sss?format=rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "craigslist ocala | for sale search", "title": "WANTED wall mounted cabinet (Dunnellon area) $5075", "title_full": "WANTED wall mounted cabinet (Dunnellon area) $5075", "published": "2017-12-07T10:13:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.craigslist.org/01010_aYue52BQb3B_600x450.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fcbb6881061e3a21566764828a47f31d77c2b509", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS6ap0AJGLfHTxl666Rcg0XQQOUf0nf6FgxJ.eniWyu9sNsd4oUM38v..VFjbMhESkSb1A_xV.WvJMD13ejcM9u7oWO4AypM5M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:13:00.000+02:00", "title": "WANTED wall mounted cabinet (Dunnellon area) $5075", "text": "condition: good QR Code Link to This Post WANTED a wall mounted cabinet similar to the picture of the attached at a reasonable price for re-purposing.

All at once it was apparent our days were numbered and if we wanted to be a blessing to the adorable little children who were cascading into our lives at a rapid pace, we needed to focus on making memories instead of money. \nOver the years we\u2019ve learned that good things rarely happen without planning. And so, as Jacob blessed Joseph and his sons (Genesis 48:15, 16), and as our parents blessed us, we set out to bless our children and grandchildren by creating memories they could carry with them after we were gone. Here\u2019s how we did it. \n\nFamily-Togetherness Events \nWe decided to use the resources with which God had blessed us to host togetherness events for the entire family on a recurring basis. There are 19 of us, so we have to be creative. All three of our children serve in ministry, which further complicates the scheduling. \nOur first big family event took place over Thanksgiving at a Young Life camp. We had the camp to ourselves, but a blizzard came the night before our arrival. The camp was kind enough to send a snowplow to open the roads and walkways for us, and in all honesty, we were praising God for this major snowfall, as it provided countless hours of entertainment for all of us. Just walking out the door was an adventure. Endless snow-play abounded. The cabin had bedrooms for the whole gang and a kitchen to prepare our meals. We had an amazing time together. We had decided to also celebrate Christmas while we were there. The whole week was a memory we still talk about. \nWe can\u2019t afford an event like that every year, so our goal is to plan for something about every five years. Our whole family looks forward to these times together. We have gone on two cruises and another one is planned. These have been big hits. Nothing compares to seeing everyone clean up and arrive for dinner on a cruise ship, watching the grandkids sample new and exotic foods they would never get at home, and listening to descriptions of that day\u2019s adventures. \n\nAge-13 Trips \nAs fun as those events are, we realized we have very limited one-on-one time with our grandchildren and that opportunities for getting together were dwindling as they aged. So we came up with a second plan: We would take each grandchild on a trip when they turned 13. After additional thought, we decided to take two grandchildren at a time. Since our grandchildren are all spaced about one year apart, each trip would consist of one child who was a little over 13 and one a little under 13. We weren\u2019t certain this would work\u2014we were combining boy and girl cousins who were turning 13, after all\u2014but we persisted. The cousins discovered that once they were out of their home environment and they had no one else to hang out with, they could have a lot of fun together. \n\nThree-Generation Trips \nAfter a while the \u201cage 13\u201d trips were ending, and so we devised one last opportunity to bless our grandchildren (and our children) before they were thrust into adulthood. We decided on high school graduation trips, but with one important stipulation: these would be gender-specific, three-generation trips. In other words, Grandma, Mom, and Daughter or Grandpa, Dad, and Son. What awesome times we have had making memories and connecting with each other on these trips! We strive for flexibility in our planning, taking into consideration the circumstances and interests of each grandchild. \n\nMaking the Most of Limited Opportunities \nThese get-togethers and trips have provided countless opportunities to talk one-on-one with kids and grandkids about what is important to them and what is important to us; and to put a face on biblical values as we interpret them. In other words, we\u2019ve created opportunities to show, rather than just tell, why we live as we do, why we choose to hold ourselves to a higher standard than the world does, and why it is important to represent our God well while we live on this earth. We\u2019ve sought to model generosity, kindness, faithfulness, forgiveness, love, and joy . . . even in times of sorrow. Values such as these are not automatically transferred through the generations, even for those of us in ministry. \nWe know that lives are short and opportunities to be a blessing to our families are limited. We decided to be proactive in making the most of the time we have rather than coming to a point in our lives when we would look back and regret that we had time for everyone else, but not for our family. \nWe can bless people in many different ways, and although we appreciate reading the blessings of Jacob in Genesis 48 and 49, and we believe we should use words to bestow blessings on our families, our actions can be an overwhelming validation of our words. And we have found that as we strive to bless our children and grandchildren, we are blessed in return, beyond anything we could have hoped for or expected. \nAnd now we find ourselves echoing the prayer of Jacob: May the God whom our parents served faithfully, and who has guided and loved us faithfully, and who has cared for our children, also bless our grandchildren and all generations of children to come, that they might give him glory and praise for all eternity! \nDon Wilson serves as senior pastor at Christ\u2019s Church of the Valley, a multisite church in the Phoenix, Arizona, area.

If it's not about society than why does our society see a huge prevalence of monogamous, heterosexual couples, where as relationships in antiquity were more open; if you weren't born into modern, Christian Europe, and instead were born a Roman aristocrat, you'd probably think its okay to love your wife, while also engaging in passionate sex with men, women and even children. It's all about society's constraints. If it wasn't, why do you think certain sectors of society are more prone to adultery, is it because their relationships are less satisfying? Or could there be other, external factors...\nQuote: I don't think you should let your urges gain control over you.\nGain control? Where did this come from? This might ostensibly be somewhat reasonable if sexual urges only came from physical attraction, but they don't: they come from emotional connection, respect and admiration and a myriad of other factors. If you feel sexually attracted to someone else while in a relationship, whose role is it to decide whether or not that's a reflection on the nature of the relationship? It's not a question of whether those urges should be allowed to \"control you\" its a question of why they should even be repressed in the first place.\nLet me ask you this: are you really claiming that open relationships must inherently be unsatisfying otherwise they would be monogamous relationships? Really think about that.\nQuote: Unless you are willing to suggest that nobody is really ever satisfied with their partner alone, and I don't think that's true.\nYou're assuming that sexual and emotional satisfaction are some quota that has to be met: this is an obvious fallacy. I'd say that our need for emotional connection and sexual stimulation are infinite . Or do you really think that any sexual thoughts about someone else are a sign that a relationship is \"unfulfilling\" despite the fact that every relationship is intrinsically different?\nIt's not that you're getting something you should be getting from your partner from other people, it's that you are getting something completely different from what they give you.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://media.gtanet.com/gtaforums/images/html/emoticons/wink.gif"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:28.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b875c5e186a9bba8af22085dc27a66fc5853101f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzYkKd9ICQ4lx6Tq7v_wUs4.wb0eV8tlnVh.BMRkCDaq04sKrQKBsVCoFQ1YZZx8oNVMi5hjLBjbyZcSkjRyA_oE8vKkwSloQM-", "site_full": "facebooknewsblogs.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://facebooknewsblogs.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Facebook News Blog", "title": "Google Alert - facebook", "title_full": "Google Alert - facebook", "published": "2017-12-07T11:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b875c5e186a9bba8af22085dc27a66fc5853101f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzYkKd9ICQ4lx6Tq7v_wUs4.wb0eV8tlnVh.BMRkCDaq04sKrQKBsVCoFQ1YZZx8oNVMi5hjLBjbyZcSkjRyA_oE8vKkwSloQM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Douglas (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "Google Alert - facebook", "text": "facebook As-it-happens update \u22c5 December 7, 2017 NEWS Facebook destaca los principales momentos del 2017 PR Newswire (Comunicado de prensa) Terremoto en M\u00e9xico: La respuesta a esta crisis a fines de septiembre marc\u00f3 el m\u00e1s alto n\u00famero de interacciones totales dentro del Centro de Respuesta a Crisis en Facebook en lo que va del a\u00f1o, con millones de personas declar\u00e1ndose a salvo, ofreciendo ayuda a su comunidad o bien donando a la ...

Firstly, the break away from the fandom has been very good for me as I focused on some very important and personal/professional priorities. The entire fandom needed a break and a breather from recent events and I hope you are feeling as good as I am too. Like many of you, I think we needed time to focus on other things and reassess our interests. For me, as a fan of cinema and a supporter of some of my favorite entertainers, I used the past month to watch some incredible films, and participate in Q&As with celebrities supporting their new films. THIS is the reason why I moved to Los Angeles, and as we enter awards season, the timing is perfect to fill in the void of not being as active in the fandom, and this time has allowed me to develop an appreciation for talent that I might have overlooked had I been as concentrated on Michael Fassbender as I was in the past. But more on that later. The latest Michael Fassbender article was released this week, but it was not from an entertainment magazine, it was from Automobile Mag where Michael discussed his new car racing career hobby. The highlight of the article had a comment from Michael where he is giving the impression that his life as an actor may be taking a backseat in his Ferrari as he considers focusing on race car driving. Michael says, \"Honestly, if I had a choice I'd choose race driving over acting.\" Well Michael, you do have a choice, we all have a choice, and you have put acting on hold to pursue a hobby that makes you happy. So that leaves many of his fans waiting around for the announcement of his next film, because the reality of the situation is that we came to know and like him from his work as an actor. Although I have shared articles and pictures of Michael's racing previously, I did it out of an obligation to keep the blog and FF@FB active with Fassbender related information. But it has never been my intention to shift the blog to support Michael in his race car driving activities. Honestly, the hobby does not interest me in the least, but it is something that brings joy to Michael, and I support that. However, FF will not cover his hobby because it is not about his role as an actor. So that brings me to ponder the question of how much longer will Michael be off the Hollywood grid and when will his next role be announced. Michael is incredibly talented and he has so much to offer in future roles that challenge him, be it an Indie, or a blockbuster film. It's my hopes that whatever Michael is going through, he deals with it, be happy, and go back to making the kind of films he wants. And this brings me to the blog situation. For as long as Michael is not acting, or participating in the world of movie making where I can write an update here on him, there will be few updates here at Fassinating Fassbender. Instead, I will focus more of my time at my other blog, Theatre of Zen , where I will continue to write film reviews. As a matter of fact, I have recently joined Film Independent at the Film Lover level which allows me to be able to vote in the upcoming Spirit Awards. I will get DVD screeners of films nominated for the Spirit awards, and receive invites to private screenings, etc. And also, I will be attending the Palm Springs Film Festival Gala on January 2. As you may remember, I went to this gala in 2016 when Michael received the International Star - Male award. I will drive back to Palm Springs the following weekend to watch a few films and hang out with my TIFF Canadian snowbird friends. Also this week, for the first time since May 2009, I changed my twitter account from @FassFass to @TheatreofZen, and I added my photo. Again, this is a change I have been thinking about for a few months as we head into the awards season, and I want to put more attention on the Zen blog in support of my increased focus on covering film and the entertainment industry beyond the scope of Michael Fassbender. And as timing would have it with Michael being more interested in driving race cars, it's a natural progression for me to focus on things that bring me great joy as well. You're probably thinking, well Simone, what does this all mean, are you giving up on Michael Fassbender? No, I'm not closing down the blog or FF@FB. But until Michael's interests shifts back into making films, there will be less for me to write about his acting career. The biggest change will be my discontinuing the TGIFassy! and Michael Monday series. I see no point in searching for images to post on these two days and strain to write something fun and informative when the well is completely dry. It's a disservice to my readers, and it'll be a burden on me. It is amazing how optimistic this year started off with me coming off a very fun and productive 2016 in covering public events for Michael, and up through this spring when I shook his hand at the Alien: Covenant premiere in Hollywood. Now, he's not actively working as an actor, and I have no interest in covering his car driving hobby. I will keep tabs on him of course, but I reckon for the next six months or so, it's going to be pretty slow news on Michael Fassbender.

Scott teaches preaching and New Testament at Ozark Christian College, Joplin, Missouri. This lesson treatment is published in issue no. 50\u201353 (December 10-31, 2017) of The Lookout magazine, and is also available online at www.lookoutmag.com . \n\nBy Mark Scott \nIn this Advent month, our lesson today celebrates the coming of the gospel to the nations. The tidings of great joy would come to the island of Cyprus. A proconsul would receive the Christ of Christmas and a sorcerer would cry, \u201cBah, humbug!\u201d In both cases great discernment would be necessary to understand the victory of and the battle for the gospel. \nWe need discernment today to understand the calling of the Holy Spirit for mission and to perceive the deception of the enemy\u2019s discouragement about that mission. \nDiscerning the Spirit\u2019s Calling | Acts 13:1-5 \nThis is a decisive moment in the Book of Acts. The gospel had spread to Jerusalem (chapters 1-7), to all Judea and Samaria (chapters 8-12), and now was postured to spread throughout the entire Roman Empire (chapters 13-28). We have already been introduced to the missionary-enterprising church in Antioch of Syria (Acts 11:19-31). Barnabas and Saul had taught this racially integrated congregation for some time, and now this church took center stage (and even stole the show from the mother church in Jerusalem). \nThe first groups to discern what the Holy Spirit was calling them to do were the prophets and teachers . Prophets were inspired, and teachers were inspiring. Perhaps the Holy Spirit spoke audibly from Heaven or from some inward impulse of the believers. But it makes good contextual sense to believe that the Holy Spirit indicated his desire through one of the prophets or leaders mentioned. \nThe five people who discerned this missionary calling of the Spirit could not have been more diverse. There was a Levite from Cyprus, a black Jew from south of the Sahara in Africa, a Greek man from the northern part of Africa (Libya), a man of clout and means who grew up with royalty, and a rabbi steeped in Judaism and university trained. The calling of the Spirit took the first and last men in the list for missionary service. \nThe context for the Spirit\u2019s call was worship (liturgy) and fasting (abstaining from food for some spiritual purpose). Missions were born from worship. The Holy Spirit set apart Barnabas and Saul for the work . Make no mistake about it. Church planting is work. Heaven had already called these two missionaries. The Spirit was now making it known, and the church was recognizing that call. \nThe Antioch congregation got in sync with the Spirit by fasting, praying, ordaining (one of the six uses of the laying on of hands in the Bible), and sending off Barnabas and Saul. The team put out to sea from Seleucia, but the first target audience for the gospel was Barnabas\u2019s home island, Cyprus (Acts 4:36). The missionaries worked their way through the island from east to west (Salamis to Paphos). They preached the gospel ( proclaimed the word of God ) in the synagogues (see Acts 13:16-41 for the typical things preached) and had John Mark (author of the second Gospel) as their helper (under servant). \nDiscerning the Deceiver\u2019s Opposition | Acts 13:6-12 \nOne thing is for sure\u2014wherever the gospel goes, Satan will rear his ugly head and attempt to thwart its advance. In Acts 8 when the gospel went to Samaria there was Simon the sorcerer. In Acts 16 when the gospel went to Europe there was a slave girl who predicted the future by a spirit. In Acts 19 when the gospel went to all of Asia Minor there were the seven sons of Sceva. And in Acts 13 when the gospel went to Cyprus there was Elymas. He is identified as complete evil\u2014notice his seven descriptions: Jewish sorcerer (Leviticus 20:6), a false prophet (Deuteronomy 18:20-22), Bar-Jesus (son of one called Jesus), a child of the devil (John 8:44), an enemy of everything that is right, full of deceit and trickery, and one who perverted the way of God. His mockery of the gospel could not be more evident. \nElymas knew his gig was up. His counterfeit spirituality and influence was being trumped by the genuine power of the gospel. No wonder he attacked the faith (the body of doctrine located in Christ). Paul took all he could take. With special inspiration from the Spirit, Paul condemned Elymas and predicted his blindness (see Acts 9:1-19a). Elymas\u2019s situation was described in pitiful terms (groped about) and he needed help from others. \nBut no matter the enemy\u2019s deception, the gospel is victorious. Sergius Paulus, the headmaster of the island and an intelligent man , saw and believed. He had the faith to discern the power of the gospel. Christmas had come to the island. \n___", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barnabas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elymas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "levite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john mark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joplin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john 8:44", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bar-jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergius paulus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "international sunday school lesson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judaism", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spirit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antioch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ozark christian college", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "paphos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cyprus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antioch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samaria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seleucia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia minor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sahara", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:29.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d42800c0843c0e699ccf1daa4e1cec89317de2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_2zvBgR04j86MXT8U_WRLg19obuo8lqxaimD_IYT1Nm7ZmKSpRx9oQ0yhzmYwfMvS2TPcI88ZiA02R_1wCTz4amQ_dY04y21o-", "site_full": "www.kdtv6.com", "site": "kdtv6.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "What on earth is going on with bitcoin? - KDTV6 CYPTO NEWS", "title_full": "What on earth is going on with bitcoin? - KDTV6 CYPTO NEWS", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.147, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3d42800c0843c0e699ccf1daa4e1cec89317de2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_2zvBgR04j86MXT8U_WRLg19obuo8lqxaimD_IYT1Nm7ZmKSpRx9oQ0yhzmYwfMvS2TPcI88ZiA02R_1wCTz4amQ_dY04y21o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Crypto News Update", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "What on earth is going on with bitcoin? - KDTV6 CYPTO NEWS", "text": "Crypto News Update bitcoin , crypto news 2017 has become the year bitcoin went big. It started the year worth less than $1,000 but has soared more than 1,300% to around $14,000. Back in 2011, it was worth less than a dollar. Some leading economists and financiers are calling bitcoin a bubble and a fraud, but industry insiders say they think it's only going to get bigger as it gains more widespread acceptance. So how does the virtual digital currency work -- and what's behind its spectacular rise? What is bitcoin? Bitcoin (XBT) was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Many of its backers saw it as a simple global payment system for anyone to use rather than a financial asset for investors to trade. Unlike the U.S. dollar or Japanese yen, digital currencies such as bitcoin aren't issued by central banks like the Federal Reserve. Instead, they are \"mined\" by computers using complex algorithms. Payments in bitcoin can be made without traditional middlemen such as banks and without the need to give your name. That made bitcoin popular with criminals and others who wanted to move money anonymously. But it's also been adopted by businesses around the world as a way to pay for everyday things like groceries, train tickets and haircuts. Its price has taken off this year as mainstream investors have become more interested. National governments are trying to keep up, puzzling over how to regulate bitcoin and other so-called cryptocurrencies. Countries like China and Venezuela have expressed interested in creating their own digital forms of money. Why have prices gone crazy? Some experts say the biggest force pushing bitcoin prices higher this year has been ... higher prices. Investors have been buying in this year out of \"FOMO,\" or the fear of missing out, according to Dave Chapman, managing director of Octagon Strategy, a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange. \"There is admittedly a lot of speculation in this market,\" he said. Bitcoin is also being driven higher by the hands-off approach many financial regulators seem to be taking toward the digital currency, Chapman said. Japan's government, for example, gave bitcoin the seal of approval and started licensing bitcoin exchanges earlier this year. The only black mark has been China, which has been cracking down some uses of the virtual currency. Announcements from some major financial institutions in the U.S. are helping bitcoin gain greater mainstream acceptance. This month, investors will be able to start trading bitcoin futures via the Chicago Board Options Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. New York's Nasdaq plans to launch its own bitcoin futures in 2018. \"The fact the CME, CBOE and Nasdaq will now all offer bitcoin products lends additional legitimacy\" to the digital currency, said Chapman. Who's buying it? For much of this year, it's mom-and-pop investors who have been buying in. Many are in Japan and South Korea, where recent regulation changes have made it easier to trade bitcoin, according to experts. But the biggest gains from the virtual currency's massive rally are likely to be concentrated among a relatively small number of investors. When you invest in bitcoin, you don't have to buy a whole unit. According to research site BitInfoCharts, the vast majority of bitcoin accounts contain just 0.1 bitcoin (about $1,400) or less. Just 3% of more than 20 million bitcoin accounts hold one bitcoin or more. Big institutional investors such as hedge funds and assets managers have largely stayed on the sidelines. But some experts predict they'll move into the market in the coming months, despite skepticism from the likes of Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon. What's next? Some industry insiders are incredibly bullish. Arthur Hayes, CEO of Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Bitmex, predicts prices could hit a mind-boggling $50,000 by the end of next year, driven by the flow of money when institutional investors \"pull the trigger\" on investing in the digital currency. Octagon's Chapman is willing to stick his neck out even further. He thinks it will go above $100,000 before 2018 is over. With a total value of around $235 billion, the bitcoin market is small compared with more established assets. \"This is a drop in the ocean compared to the trillions transacted daily\" in currency and stock markets, said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Gatecoin. Just a small amount of mainstream investors' money would make a big difference to bitcoin prices, he said. But some finance industry veterans are wary. Oanda's Innes, who has worked in currency trading for decades, referenced a famous piece of investment advice from Buffett: \"Be fearful when others are greedy.\" \"Following the herd rarely produces large scale gains,\" Innes said. Investors were given a reminder of bitcoin's unpredictability in November. After topping $11,000, it plunged more than $2,000 before resuming its ascent. *** ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chapman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arthur hayes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas glucksmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave chapman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "innes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nasdaq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "octagon strategy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago board options exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago mercantile exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jpmorgan chase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "octagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oanda", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:55:29.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42be26c384d3b8e30fc6fb99dbbf745d89e87cb6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzuW0Up1GA78hY1rCz1aAuFGOtfAfBB.ZldO2e9hmjSvcZvD5oDHyorBVm3lSSrN0nGCausXAfsEQcRJZOBUe8caipjs4ummYq6fP0GnCkuxw--", "site_full": "forums.hardwarezone.com.sg", "site": "hardwarezone.com.sg", "site_section": "http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/taiwan-291/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Taiwan - www.hardwarezone.com.sg", "title": "Exchange Rate - Part 2 - Page 11", "title_full": "Exchange Rate - Part 2 - Page 11 - www.hardwarezone.com.sg", "published": "2017-12-06T15:10:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/img/sg/hwz-og-logo-big.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5181, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "89a557b40444ab81dd308cbb329e44d68720bdcc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzuW0Up1GA78hY1rCz1aAuFGOtfAfBB.ZldO2e9hmjSvcZvD5oDHyorBVm3lSSrN0nGCausXAfsEQcRJZOBUe8caipjs4ummYqtKPB16YAhcqW._HjH2pACKfyqFoDKHdQ-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Mugen", "published": "2017-12-07T07:21:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Just changed at arcade.
